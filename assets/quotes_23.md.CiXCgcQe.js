Lewis had voluntarily sought care following the onset of acute mental health issues and died from cerebral hypoxia (lack of oxygen to the brain) soon after, following actions that involved eleven officers of London's Metropolitan Police. After seven years of campaigning by Lewis' family and two inquiries by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), a second coroners' inquiry was raised. The inquiry ruled the restraint was disproportionate and found the officers had failed to follow training on both the restraint of people with medical conditions and treatment of non- responsive people. Bethlem was also judged to have had several failures in Lewis's assessment, treatment and care. The IPCC recommended a review of six police officers for gross misconduct in relation to the incident, but all were later cleared by the Metropolitan Police in closed hearings. South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, the body managing Bethlem, received no charges, though it made changes to its internal processes as a result. The Mental Health Units (Use of Force) Bill 2018, known as \\"Seni's Law\\", was passed into British law in November 2018, making several provisions to limit the use of force on mental health patients and to require police officers working in mental health units to wear police body cameras where reasonable. It also required that hospitals record data and release reports on incidents involving physical force, including data on age, gender and ethnicity of those restrained. All reports covering patient deaths must be reviewed by the Secretary of State in an annual review. Lewis's death returned to national attention in 2020 following the George Floyd protests in the United Kingdom, in relation to the disproportionate number of black, Asian and minority ethnic people killed by UK law enforcement officers. Background Lewis's alma mater Kingston University Born to Ajibola Lewis (a Nigerian-born lawyer) and Conrad Lewis (an engineer), Olaseni Lewis (known as Seni) was a Black British man from South Norwood in south-east London. He grew up there with his two older sisters and was well known in his neighbourhood, having given neighbours lifts in his car. He attended Kingston University in south London and, regarded as a bright student, went on to study a masters degree in business and information technology there.Dominiczak, Peter & Linsell, Katie (15 September 2010).

CCTV during his time at Mayday showed him struggling to remain still, asking for help, and hugging staff and security. Lewis's state caused accident and emergency doctors there to ask his family to agree that he be taken to a place of safety, under section 136 if the Mental Health Act 1983. He was transferred and admitted to a safety suite at Maudsley Hospital soon after, where he was medicated. His father Conrad and friend Omari Faria arrived during this time. That afternoon he left the hospital and walked to nearby Denmark Hill railway station. His father, Faria and hospital staff pursued him to encourage him to return to the hospital and Lewis went back to Maudsley after police were called. Upon returning to Maudsley, Lewis was voluntarily readmitted but managers stated that due to his home address he would have to be transferred to Bethlem Royal Hospital, a well-known psychiatric hospital in London also known as Bedlam. Ajibola Lewis reflected that a nurse at Maudsley advised her not to send her son there, saying \\"as a young black man in London, it‚Äôs very easy to be picked on\\" and a doctor suggested she treat the issue as a \\"one-off\\". Lewis was briefly discharged to his mother's care, but feeling unable to cope she then agreed that Lewis go to Bethlem on a voluntary basis. Police restraint and death Lewis and his parents travelled to Bethlem on the evening of 31 August and on their arrival his mother described a chaotic scene. Lewis voluntarily admitted himself to the hospital on the basis that he could leave if he desired and that his family would be contacted in the event of any problem. At 8:30pm his parents were told to leave as visiting hours had finished. Lewis's state deteriorated after his parents had left and he decided to leave the hospital. However, staff prevented him from leaving and, frustrated as he understood he was a voluntary patient, Lewis damaged a door. Staff did not contact his parents but instead called the police to report Lewis for criminal damage. Exterior of Bethlem Hospital, where Lewis was restrained Police arrived soon after and placed Lewis in handcuffs and moved him to a padded room at the hospital. Over a period of 30‚Äì40 minutes eleven police officers subjected him to restraint in the room for a period of ten minutes. After Lewis tried to leave the room, officers restrained him for a second time for a period of 20 minutes. They placed him in two sets of handcuffs, which left Lewis with his left arm locked in front of his head and his right arm locked behind his back. They also placed him in leg restraints, one set around his ankles and one set around his legs. The method of restraint was against police practice and was later judged as dangerous. Lewis was held down face first on a bed, then the floor. The police struck him three times with a police baton during this period. Lewis was confused during the restraint, calling for police to take their dogs off him. The police asserted that for his safety they continued to restrain him until he stopped resisting. Lewis fell unconscious after 20 minutes due to restricted breathing and police chose to leave him in the room, believing him to be faking unconsciousness.

The hearing was criticised by the family, because it was held behind closed doors with neither press nor public scrutiny. Coroners inquiry A coroners inquest by the South London Coroners Court was completed on 28 June 2017. It noted several concerns during his investigation. He noted that the police officers had used excessive force, had poor training on restraint, were not clear on the definition of \\"prolonged restraint\\", and had no guidance on how to react if efforts to restrain had not been successful for a long period. Officers also did not properly recognise that Lewis was having an \\"acute behavioural disturbance\\" (ABD) and may be at risk of death. The inquiry remarked on the fact that ABD is a police definition with no medical basis and that officers may be better served by general guidance on risks when restraining mentally ill people. The division of duties and responsibilities between police and medical staff were unclear. It was also noted that police were called as a result of a lack of available and trained medical staff. At coroner's inquest the jury found many failures by both police and medical staff which played a part in Lewis's death. They said \\"The excessive force, pain compliance techniques and multiple mechanical restraints were disproportionate and unreasonable. On the balance of probability, this contributed to the cause of death.\\" However, the jury did not record a verdict of unlawful killing.Met police to hold gross misconduct hearing on restraint death of Olaseni Lewis behind closed doors.

KDSJ-TV (VHF analog channel 5) in Lead, was a satellite of KRSD. Owned by Heart of the Black Hills Stations, the two stations went on air in 1958 and 1960, respectively, and ceased broadcasting in 1976. Their licenses were not renewed by the Federal Communications Commission as a result of a years-long proceeding involving serial deficiencies in their technical operation. History KRSD-TV began telecasting the evening of January 21, 1958. It was co-owned with KRSD (1340 AM) in Rapid City and KDSJ (980 AM) in Deadwood and debuted from new radio and television studios located on Mountain View Road. KRSD-TV was the second station on air in Rapid City and was a primary NBC affiliate. With the Rapid City station on the air, Heart of the Black Hills Stations began construction the next year on the satellite station at Lead, which went into service on January 6, 1960. By this time, KRSD-KDSJ was splitting ABC programming with its competitor, KOTA-TV (channel 3). In 1965, the Federal Communications Commission adopted new network non-duplication rules for cable systems. These new policies protected local stations from competition by out-of-town imported stations by requiring the local station to be shown over any other station carrying the same programming. The Black Hills Video Corporation cable system in Rapid City had dropped KRSD-TV and resumed carriage of KOA-TV in Denver; it then resumed carrying KRSD-TV in place of KOA-TV on December 31, 1965. Within hours, the system, which served Rapid City and Ellsworth Air Force Base, received 110 calls demanding it reverse the move, and 15 subscribers canceled their service, in what Broadcasting magazine termed an \\"uprising\\"; the FCC allowed the station to drop KRSD-TV again after an engineer was dispatched from the FCC's field office in Denver and agreed that KRSD-TV's incoming signal was inadequate. Signal and regulatory problems continued. In September 1966 and October 1967, the FCC issued notices of violation to KRSD-TV and KDSJ-TV; the FCC field engineer from Denver said that, of 40 stations he had inspected, they were \\"the poorest he had found in the entire district\\". The next year, the commission designated the two stations' license renewals for hearings, seeking to determine if the management was so \\"negligent, careless, or inept\\" that it could not be relied upon to serve as a licensee. In March 1969, hearings were held in Rapid City, at which scores of witnesses appeared. The head of the Rapid City chamber of commerce stated that local viewers were disappointed in the performance of the Heart of the Black Hills stations; Eli Daniels, one of the two owners of the company, said the Associated Press report had mischaracterized his testimony and did not take a stand in favor of or against renewal. In July 1970, an FCC examiner recommended a probationary one-year license renewal for KRSD-TV and KDSJ-TV. Another major change occurred that year: the station exchanged primary network affiliations with KOTA-TV on September 13, switching from NBC to CBS, apparently after KOTA and NBC struck a deal. The chief of the FCC's Broadcast Bureau, however, objected to the renewal proposal, and by the time the commission heard oral argument in October 1971, three more notices of violation had been issued, one to Rapid City and two to the Lead station, on top of the 1966 and 1967 violations and additional notices issued in 1969. For the commission, the litany of violations accumulated over the stations' time on air, from faulty tower lighting and spurious emissions to poorly kept logs and low-power broadcasts, plus a petition signed by 2,000 Rapid City viewers in 1967, merited denial of the stations' license renewals because they had deprived the public of service. It was the first time a television station had been denied license renewal on technical grounds. Heart of the Black Hills Stations‚Äîwhich had sold KRSD radio earlier in the year‚Äîimmediately announced its plans to appeal and expressed disappointment that the FCC had not approved an application to improve its facilities. Daniels stated that, if the FCC had allowed it to install a new antenna, it could have raised the funds needed to replace its transmitter. It charged that the station had received letters saying its picture was good, though most in actuality concerned the availability of CBS network fare and of two competing stations in the Rapid City market. After the FCC denied a petition for reconsideration, Heart of the Black Hills took the case to federal appeals court, which upheld the decision in February 1973. In the wake of that ruling, a new company, Dakota Broadcasting Company, formed to seek new licenses for channels 7 and 5 and proposed an entirely new operation without using any of the facilities involved in broadcasting KRSD-TV or KDSJ- TV. The commission accepted Dakota's application in late May and set a period for potential other applicants to file. Heart of the Black Hills continued to fight, putting letter cards to mail to Congress in support of KRSD-TV in the Rapid City Journal newspaper. Two applicants proposed to replace KRSD-TV and KDSJ-TV: Dakota Broadcasting and Western Television, a group with investors from Sturgis and Sioux Falls. Both sought interim operation while the FCC decided the fate of their applications; the two companies had a series of disagreements on technical issues, and the FCC ordered them to craft a joint proposal. The commission proposed to give Western interim authority if it allowed Dakota to join it. While Western hoped to be on the air by the end of the year, Western's plans hit a major snag after the death of Morton Henkin, chairman of its board of directors, in August. That event prompted the National Bank of South Dakota to advise Western that its $650,000 loan agreement would need to be renegotiated, which in turn led Dakota to ask for more financial information from Western. In October, that company's stockholders then withdrew their application. The FCC finally granted construction permits for new channel 7 and 5 TV stations to Dakota in May 1975. The Heart of the Black Hills stations were allowed to remain on the air until Dakota could start broadcasting, but their financial difficulties ultimately forced them to make an early exit. On February 18, 1976, the company announced that KRSD-TV and KDSJ-TV would leave the air on February 29, due to increased operational costs, but Dakota would not be ready to begin broadcasts until July. Rapid City was left with just one television station for more than four months, causing the local cable company to record a surge in new subscribers. Two-station service was restored when KEVN and KIVV, branded as \\"Action 7 & 5\\", began telecasting July 11, 1976 as primary ABC affiliates. In June 1980, a judge awarded the Associated Press a $1,210 judgment for services rendered to the former KRSD-TV after a breach of contract suit against Heart of the Black Hills Stations seeking payments for the wire service used by KDSJ radio and KRSD-TV. KOTA and KEVN carried some CBS programming in Rapid City, but the market would not have a full-time CBS affiliate until KELO-TV of Sioux Falls established a translator in Rapid City in 1981. The Rapid City KELO translator and KGGG-FM used KRSD-TV's former tower, which Daniels continued to own. The KDSJ-TV transmitter building burned in a 1981 fire.

The exact date of the emergence of weaving in Iran is not yet known, but it is likely to coincide with the emergence of civilization. Clothing in Iran is mentioned in Persian mythology. Ferdowsi and many historians have considered Keyumars to be the inventor of the use of animals' skin and hair as clothing.

Life=Family and Early life Enriqueta Garc√≠a y Mart√≠n was born on November 3, 1862 in Matanzas, Cuba to the wealthy Garc√≠a family of Spain and was noted for her distinctly European features of fair skin and blonde hair. Their family was of considerable prominence in the broader Matanzas province. Her brother, F√©lix Garc√≠a y Mart√≠n (sometimes misprinted as Telix), was a doctor and a regional insurgent leader in Matanzas during the Cuban War of Independence. After the war, he continued to be an active medical figure in the region and assisted American forces stationed there during the ensuing period following the conclusion of the Spanish- American War.https://books.google.com/books?id=9sRksaERuDUC&pg;=PA2335&dq;=Felix+Garc%C3%ADa+Martin+Matanzas+Cuba&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwj1tr-W94TrAhXkSt8KHYr9DS8Q6AEIRzAF#v=onepage&q;=Felix%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Martin%20Matanzas%20Cuba&f;=false Dr. Garc√≠a then became second highest-ranking doctor in the Matanzas province and was later promoted to Chief Doctor of the Port of Matanzas, Head of Administration.https://books.google.com/books?id=EUwrAQAAMAAJ&focus;=searchwithinvolume&q;=Felix+Garc%C3%ADa+Mart%C3%ADn+Matanzas+ As her brother focused his efforts and attention to his medical, political, and administrative career, Enriqueta became heiress to the Garc√≠a estate and administrator of its properties and financial holdings. At sixteen she was the subject of a poem included in the 1878 literary collection Jard√≠n Matancero (\\"Matanzas Garden\\"). The publication was dedicated to the debutantes of the Matanzas region in which a flower-themed poem was dedicated to each ‚Äúblossoming\\" socialite. Garc√≠a resided in historic Camarioca, in close proximity to the famed Varadero resort town, now incorporated into the nearby region of C√°rdenas. She was molded by her upbringing in the broader C√°rdenas community, which was founded by old Spanish aristocracy in 1828 and housed many elite European families. By Garc√≠a's lifetime, the area had a distinct Southern American influence and was known as the \\"Charleston of the Caribbean\\" due to its unique design that broke with the traditional central-plaza Spanish layout found in much of Latin America, instead using a North American grid pattern modeled on the city of Charleston. Its unique character, complete with straight and narrow streets and horse-drawn carriages, attracted an influx of European families from Spain, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, such as the Garc√≠as and the Martins. These factors would influence her later travel and the upbringing of her children. Marriage While residing in C√°rdenas as an adult, Garc√≠a would meet lawyer and landowner Francisco E. Caza√±as, of another prominent Matanzas family who owned many landholdings and agricultural industry interests. Caza√±as inherited a large C√°rdenas property in 1890, and met Garc√≠a upon his relocation to the area from New York. The couple wed on April 30, 1894 and, in accordance with Spanish naming customs, after their marriage Garc√≠a was known as Enriqueta Garc√≠a Mart√≠n de Caza√±as, or, more simply, Enriqueta Garc√≠a Caza√±as. The marriage was significant due to Caza√±as, having been born in New Rochelle, New York,https://www.myheritage.com/names/francisco_caza%C3%B1as holding dual citizenship with the United States and Cuba, and being descendant of the Castilian Peraza family through his father, Francisco Jos√© Caza√±as y Peraza (sometimes recorded as Francis), an agriculture estate landowner in New Rochelle. Garc√≠a herself received American citizenship after her marriage to Caza√±as and would subsequently travel with an American passport. The couple frequently traveled to and occasionally resided in the US. There are surviving records of visits to New York City (1892, 1897) and New Orleans (1898). The couple had three sons, the eldest of which, Enrique, they would arrange to have educated in the United States and reside in Nashville and Winter Park. Buena Vista Garc√≠a notably owned the Buena Vista estate in Camarioca and its vast grounds. The Buena Vista property, sometimes written as Buenavista, was renown for its immensity and held its own main roads, stream, hills, prize horses, cattle, ox, as well as full staff and yacht for its proximity to Varadero. The couple resided there and, per the US Consulate records, her husband managed the property's sprawling farmlands and major sugar plantation, often known collectively as \\"Finca Buena Vista,\\" which were significant agricultural businesses in the Matanzas province. The property was damaged during the Battle of C√°rdenas in the Spanish-American War and became the center of the couple's high-profile claims case to the Spanish Treaty Claims Commission. The couple first filed their claims with the commission in 1902. It took six years to settle their claims, during which Francisco's legal background and US ties and citizenship proved useful as their claims were settled in 1908 with the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States awarding the couple total compensation of $13,138 ($9,738 to Enriqueta and $3,400 to Francisco), over $360,000 in 2020, after inflation. They received the second highest awards granted by the commission, and the highest among private citizens not representing a corporation. Their legal case was the subject of a book published in 2012, Francisco E. Caza√±as and Enriqueta Garcia v. The United States. While the couple also owned other property, the manor would remain the Caza√±as family's main residence until the Cuban Revolution, after which it was nationalized and made into a village (subdivision) of Cardenas. Other properties and businesses Their filings with the Spanish Treaty Claims Commission offered other rare glimpses into the Caza√±as-Garc√≠a property holdings. They describe the family's ‚Äúextensive landed estates\\" that were each ‚Äúelaborately and expensively furnished.‚Äù Other estates mentioned in addition to Buena Vista included Dos Rosas, Pura y Limpia, Dolores, Rosario, and others, all of which sustained at least some damage during the Cuban War of Independence. Some were adjacent to each other and some were on the coast described in court documents as ‚ÄúSituated on a sort of promontory extending out into the ocean between the Bay of C√°rdenas and Bay of Matanzas‚Äù within \\"a strategic area to combatants,\\" likely Varadero. Many of these functioned as sugar estates, plantations, and stock farms throughout the Matanzas province in the towns and districts of Camarioca, Santana, and C√°rdenas. A Peraza relative of Caza√±as testified to the commission ‚ÄúI witnessed the destruction of some splendid houses [Francisco] Caza√±as had on Santana.‚Äù The couple made the Pura y Limpia estate their main residence during the extent of the battles, during which Spanish forces viewed them with suspicion due to the prominent role of Garc√≠a's brother, Dr. F√©lix Garc√≠a Mart√≠n, in the insurgency, causing the couple to relocate temporarily to the United States as the Spanish American War progressed. While many of their properties had originally belonged to the Garc√≠a family, it is known that the historic Dos Rosas sugar plantation estate was already in the ownership of the Caza√±as family, having been purchased in 1868 by Bartolom√© Caza√±as, a grandfather of Francisco E. Caza√±as. The vast estate was originally named \\"San Francisco de Paula-Riverol\\" and Bartolom√© Caza√±as renamed it that year to \\"Dos Rosas\\" (Spanish for \\"Two Roses\\") in honor of his Italian wife, Rosa Cambiaggi, and their daughter. The Caza√±as-Garc√≠a family also owned properties in Santa Clara, Sagua la Grande, and Havana. As with Buena Vista, all of these estates, plantations, and mills were dismantledhttp://www.cubagen.org/mills.htm or nationalized after the Cuban Revolution and many, including Dos Rosas and Pura y Limpia, were made into small towns and villages.https://www.cubatechtravel.com/knowing_cuba/details/en/28555/Dos- Rosas-Town-Matanzas- Cubahttps://dondeesta.biz/index.php?qcountry_code=CU&qregion;_code=03&qcity;=Pura%20y%20Limpia Later life and Progeny=Death Enriqueta Garc√≠a's health declined later in life as she suffered from brain cancer, eventually succumbing to the disease by the mid-1930s. Progeny Garc√≠a is also noted for her descendants. Garc√≠a and her husband had three sons: successful Havana businessman Enrique Caza√±as, the prominent judge and close Batista associate Pedro Pablo Caza√±as, and Eduardo, the youngest. Her granddaughters by Pedro Pablo Caza√±as, Raquel and Marta, would have high-profile marriages to Cuban leaders Rene de la Huerta (a psychiatrist and leader of the Agrupaci√≥n Cat√≥lica Universitaria) and Jes√∫s Permuy, respectively. Her grandson by Pedro Pablo, Eduardo Caza√±as y D√≠az, voluntarily enlisted in the United States Army with the rank of SP-4 as an Armor Reconnaissance Specialist. He died in combat in 1967 during the Vietnam War and his death was covered in both Englishhttps://www.vvmf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cazanas-Diasz-Edwardo- obit.jpg and Spanish media, including the Diario Las Americas. He received the Purple Heart for his actions in battle, was interred in Lauderdale Memorial Park, and is included in the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington D.C. Her great-grandchildren would include further noted figures such as the author and spiritual leader Christian De La Huerta and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) and United States-Spain Council President, Pedro Pablo Permuy.

In addition to the hospital, there was a community center and ladies' auxiliary that provided health services and also recreational and charity work to the black community.

Hale Hospital was the first hospital to serve African-Americans year-round. The hospital was opened in Nashville, Tennessee in July of 1916 by a husband and wife team, Dr. John Henry Hale and Millie Essie Gibson Hale. Millie Hale served as the both the hospital administrator and head nurse. Her husband worked as the chief surgeon. When the hospital first opened, it had 12 beds and two nurses. It was located on the second floor of the Hales' own home and eventually, the hospital took over the entire home. It also included a community center. By 1923, the hospital had 23 beds. Also by 1923, the hospital had seen around 7,000 patients and helped feed and provide clothing for many of these. Twenty-six nurses were employed at the hospital and the mortality rate for surgeries performed there was low. Eventually, the hospital had 75 beds and also included rooms dedicated to specializations such as a surgery room and a maternity ward. The American College of Surgeons \\"fully recognized\\" the hospital. The hospital also helped train nurses from Meharry Medical College, giving them practical experience. The hospital's community center, which was also once a house owned by the Hales, included a free clinic and dispensary. The center also provided classes related to healthcare and childcare. In addition to providing education and practical needs, the community center screened movies and held concerts. The ladies' auxiliary of the hospital helped provide food, clothing and companionship to the poor and the sick in the city. The auxiliary helped maintain the many social service programs provided by the hospital. The auxiliary also helped find foster homes for children. They also provided job- training programs for young women and assistance to women who were facing financial hardship. Because there were no parks that black people could use in Nashville during the Jim Crow era, Millie Hale purchased 4 plots of land that were turned into playgrounds and recreational space. Hale staffed the parks with a director and nurse. Boys' and girls' clubs were organized. The hospital closed in 1938 when Dr. John Henry Hale was appointed the chief of surgery at Meharry Medical College. Millie E. Hale had died in 1930. While the hospital closed, the social services the hospital had provided continued to serve the community after 1938.

Early life  Serov was born on 19 July 1922 to a Russian peasant family in Kurganinsk. After completing his eighth grade of school he trained at an aeroclub and worked as a handyman before entering the military in 1941. That year he graduated from the Krasnodar Military Aviation School of Pilots.  World War II  In April 1942 he was deployed to the warfront with the 159th Fighter Aviation Regiment, and on 30 August that year he gained his first aerial victory - the shared kill of a Bf 109. However, it was not until November that he gained his first solo shootdown - another Bf 109. He went on to gain another shootdown two days later, which turned out to be his last aerial victory on the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk. Eventually in May the next year he tallied his first kill on the new La-5, and from then on he quickly increased his tally, often gaining two shootdowns in a day; throughout the battle of Leningrad he engaged in intense aerial battles, especially in early 1944. In April 1944 he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union for completing 203 sorties, engaging in 53 dogfights, and tallying 20 solo plus six shared shootdowns. However, being awarded the title posthumously in August rapidly increased his tally during the intense battle for the Karelian Isthmus. Accounts of his last flight differ - some sources claims he shot down two enemy aircraft before fatally ramming another, but those claims are not reflected in his official tally, which indicates the shootdown of one Bf 109 on 26 June 1944 before he was killed in action. Despite arriving on the warfront as an ordinary pilot with the rank of sergant and participating in the conflict for barely two years before he was killed in action, he quickly rose through the ranks to the position of deputy squadron commander and rank of senior lieutenant; his final tally accumulated through the course of approximately 300 sorties and 104 dogfights officially stands at 39 solo and six shared shootdowns, including Bf 109, Bf 110, Ju 87, Ju 88, He 111, and FW 190 aircraft.

He was the son of Istv√°n Sz√©chenyi and was in charge of the State Fire Brigade in Hungary and the Ottoman Empire.  Early Life  √ñd√∂n was a membr of the Sz√©chenyi family in S√°rv√°r-Fels≈ëvid√©k. His father was Count Istv√°n Sz√©chenyi and his mother was Countess Seilern Crescence . He was baptized in the parish of St. Martin in Pressburg (Pozsony, today's Bratislava): his godparents were Count B√©la Sz√©chenyi and Count M√°ria Zichy. √ñd√∂n moved to Pest at 21, where he worked in different branches of transportion. At this time he obtained a qualification to be a ship officer. He traveled to London for the World's Fair in 1862, where he came into contact with organized firefighting.  Working in Fire- fighting  After the world exhibition, Sz√©chenyi tried to bring firefighting to Hungary. After finding sponsors in Hungary in 1863, he founded the Budapest Voluntary Fire Brigade Association. In 1869, he recruited the National Gymnastics Association to able to begin training with the fire truck he purchased in London. Count √ñd√∂n Sz√©chenyi became the first president of the Hungarian National Fire Brigade Association, which was established in the early 1870s. Although Sz√©chenyi was in favor of the introduction of a volunteer fire brigade and worked hard to organize a volunteer fire brigade, from the very beginning of his movement he believed that a firefighter and a mechanic should be paid and a team of six should be hired to clean the machines. The count realized that the voluntary fire brigade alone would not be able to provide fire service properly and impeccably, and as early as 1869 he recommended the establishment of a professional city fire brigade. He took his ideas to the General Assembly and was allowed to begin the organization. Thus, the volunteer and the professional fire brigade both began their service a few days apart. After the 1st of February 1, 1870 the two fire brigades - the volunteer and the professional one - jointly performed the difficult task of firefighting under the headquarters of Count √ñd√∂n Sz√©chenyi, who lead the brigades.  Work in the Ottoman Empire  When √ñd√∂n visited Constantinople in June 1870, there had just been a devastating fire. The fire burned down the buildings of the English Embassy, the Italian Theater, the American and Portuguese Consulates, the French Baths, the German House of Love, the Armenian Catholic and Roman Catholic Archdiocese buildings. This created pressure to form a fire brigade. As Sz√©chenyi was there, he offered to help set up professional and voluntary fire brigades based on his Hungarian model. Practically nothing happened until 1873 when there were more devastating fires. In 1873, there were ,amy complaints to the Turkish authorities that nothing had happened despite the promises. At the beginning of 1874, the foreign embassies were very strongly advocating the establishment of a fire brigade, and decided their candidate was Sz√©chenyi, whose name was known throughout Europe by that time. The sultan was also under enormous pressure from the Russian ambassador, but he wanted to take Russian fire officers to Constantinople. The Russian ambassador brought in firefighters and gave a large-scale demonstration. Sz√©chenyi also sent for firefighters, who showed their own preparedness a few days after the Russian demonstration. Seeing the precise and customary practice of the disciplined military team, the sultan instructed Sz√©chenyi to set up the Turkish fire brigade in his organization, following the Hungarian model. How worked hard to form a team and equip the fire brigade. He had a fire brigade and a training ground built. The work, which had lasted for years, was so protracted that the Count eventually moved to Constantinople . He built the funicular in the Istanbul-Galata district, which runs there in an underground tunnel. In the meantime, he visited home several times ,he taught his children in Hungarian. He planned to move home, but did not have the opportunity and the way. The Turkish-Greek War, then the First World War and Trianon wore it, but found joy in the fire department. Even in his old age, he went out to the fires, directing the vaccination. He was esteemed by the alternating Turkish sultans, he received several honors and ranks, he was said to be the first Christian to receive the title of pasha without having to leave his faith and convert to the Muslim faith. Pasha √ñdon was one of the highest-ranking generals.

He was known for his magnetic prints which he created using ink covered ball-bearings manipulated with a magnet held behind the drawing board and for his large paintings in which he broadly handled paint. Biography Gorman grew up in Ottawa, a city where the National Gallery of Canada with its offering of Canadian art, particularly Tom Thomson, is an inescapable presence. Gorman's first art classes were at the gallery. Gorman was recognized early as a painter of promise. Having moved to Toronto to attend the Ontario College of Art and Design, Gorman was written about by Jock Macdonald, his teacher, that he had the greatest promise among all the young artists he knew. As a member of the Isaacs Group of artists from 1959 on, composed of artists who showed their work at the Isaacs Gallery, he was a maverick whose main interest seems to have been a search for spiritual meaning. Although achieving major success as a painter, he became an early Isaacs drop-out. In 1964, he travelled to Ibiza, an island which is part of the Balearic group in Spain. In 1966, he left for London, England, only returning to Toronto in 1971. At first, his abstraction only evoked landscape references, then he turned to painting nature full scale, especially the foliage and sky around Limerick Lake area near Bancroft, where his brother John had a cabin. He said that for him, the best thing about the city was the ruggedness of the nearby landscape. A retrospective exhibition of Jock Macdonald in 1981 sent him again to study nature. In 1983, his memories of the work of Tom Thomson came together in a three-part Homage to Tom Thomson. He invented an alter-ego for himself: a painter named Jack Pine, who used to travel the northern rivers in a canoe painted all over in a yellow-and-black checkerboard pattern modeled on Canadian road sign painting. From 1984 to 1985 he created a 30-foot mural for Ottawa's Provincial Court House, titled Before the Law. Gorman said it was an image of nature near Ottawa before the explorers came. In 1986, a second 30-foot mural was commissioned for the Department of External Affairs at the Canadian embassy in Bridgetown, Barbados. Gorman painted in watercolour as well as oil during these years, as well as making several thousand drawings of the figure. In 1889, he returned to Toronto, opened a studio, and returned, mostly, to abstraction. In 1990, the Lake Galleries in Toronto in combination with the Robert McLaughlin Gallery in Oshawa held a retrospective of 30 years of his work.

She is a Full professor of social psychology in the Department of Psychology at the University of Washington. Early life and education Cheryan was born to financial aid administrator mother Leela Cheryan and research professor father Munir Cheryan in Chicago, Illinois. Growing up, she became interested in topics revolving around race, gender, and equality. She earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology and American Studies before enrolling at Stanford University for her PhD. As a graduate student, she began to notice that the atmosphere of working or learning environments could directly influence ones choice to join the field. This led her to develop her thesis titled Strategies of belonging: defending threatened identities. After graduating from Stanford, Cheryan married her fiance Giridhar Shivaram in 2008. Career Upon earning her PhD, Cheryan immediately joined the faculty of Psychology at the University of Washington (UW) with a specific focus on gendered stereotypes and prejudices. She co-founded UW's Debunking Stereotypes Workshop with students Amanda Tose, Marissa Vichayapai, and Lauren Hudson to encourage more women to join Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Cheryan also led a research project that used statistics from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to prove that negative stereotypes of computer scientists could result in less women joining the field. As a result of her research, she received the 2009 NSF's Junior Faculty Career Award for \\"outstanding research, excellent education and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations.\\" She also earned the 2011 American Association of University Women Named Honoree for her efforts to achieve equity for women in science-based fields. During the 2012‚Äì13 academic year, Cheryan conducted three studies in New York as a Russell Sage Foundation fellow. The research project focused on the effects anti-American stereotypes had on immigrant groups in America. She also studied the negative effects that geeky male nerd stereotypes portrayed in the media had on women joining STEM fields. Cheryan and her research colleagues conducted two studies on the female undergraduate populations attending UW and Stanford University; firstly asking them to describe computer science majors and secondly asking them to read a fabricated newspaper article. At the conclusion of the study, Cheryan concluded that women were more likely than men to be influenced by negative stereotypes surrounding STEM fields. The following year, Cheryan was invited to the White House by former President Barack Obama after it was decided to create a ‚Äúcomputer science classroom design prize‚Äù in her honor. In 2015, Cheryan continued her research into stereotypes by returning to Stanford to conduct another study, this time focusing on males' perceived masculinity. She used falsified data to infer to her male participants, who were squeezing a handheld device, that they were on average or weaker than their female counterparts. She followed up her experiment by asking health and body-related questions, during which she noticed men often exaggerated their height to seem more masculine. Upon realizing this, she conducted a second male-focused group study where students would answer a masculinity test with multiple-choice questions about consumer preferences and personal attributes. Those who scored lower on the test, although all results were randomized, felt the need to overcompensate by choosing more male consumer products as compensation for their time. She also led a female-focused study where she asked undergraduate students to interact with male and female actors who pretended to be computer science majors. Half of the participants interacted with actors who fit the nerdy, geeky computer scientist stereotypes who claimed to enjoy solitary hobbies, while the others interacted with actors dressed and acting like \\"typical college students.\\" The results of the study fount that women were more influenced by stereotypes in computer science than gender. During the 2016‚Äì17 year, Cheryan continued to conduct various studies on how stereotypes directly divert young girls for pursuing a career in STEM. Cheryan and her colleagues found that the culture of STEM and lack of encouragement for women to focus on math and science were the main causes of the gender gap in STEM fields. She also led a study titled Gay Asian Americans Are Seen as More American Than Asian Americans Who Are Presumed Straight, which found that American perceived homosexual Asian Americans to be more likely to speak fluent English than those whose sexual identity was not specified. Cheryan also received a visiting fellowship position in communications at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University during the academic year. As a result of her research on gender, STEM, and female stereotypes, Cheryan was approached by Mattel in the spring of 2018 to advise on their latest Barbie dolls. She was appointed to their 12 person Barbie Global Advisory Council in order to \\"help inform and refine Barbie brand initiatives.\\" During the summer of 2019, Cheryan was promoted from Associate professor to Full professor of social psychology in the Department of Psychology.

Pre- War Career and 1919 Incident  Only one month after being built, Juan Casiano (then named Linerton) had an engine breakdown as she was travelling from the River Tyne to Baltimore, Maryland, United States on 9 November 1919. This resulted in her running aground near South Shields with no reported fatalities and she ultimately broke in two pieces. The bow was refloated on 6 April 1920 and the stern on 18 May 1920 after which both parts were towed to Rotterdam, The Netherlands to be converted into a tanker under a new owner and under the new name Radix.

She established the education department at the Anacostia Community Museum, which is a museum in the Smithsonian Institution, and worked as the Education Director there. From the 1960s until the 1990s she was the Assistant Director of that museum. Early life and education Felton is from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and attended Liberty High School in Bethlehem. She attended Moravian College, where she graduated with a B.A. degree in 1952. This made her the first black student ever admitted to Moravian College. She then obtained a master's degree in education from Howard University. Career=Director and curator Felton's first experience in museum work occurred when she was working at the Southeast Neighborhood House, which was a settlement house in Washington, D.C. She was asked by the Smithsonian Institution to survey community members to study the possibility of creating a community museum in Anacostia. That museum became the Anacostia Museum. In 1967, the Anacostia Community Museum opened under the umbrella of the Smithsonian Institution, becoming the first federally funded community museum in the United States. Felton was hired to direct the Education Department of the museum immediately after the museum was established, and she has been credited with establishing the Education Department. For nearly 30 years she was Assistant Director of the museum, and a 2020 article in the DCist described Felton as having been \\"director of the Smithsonian Anacostia Community Museum\\" during \\"the early 1990s\\". At the museum she worked closely with Louise Daniel Hutchinson. In her educational role at the Anacostia Museum, Felton was responsible for curating a number of exhibits. One exhibit that she curated focused on the effects of the Norway rat in Anacostia. She also helped to create a nature trail, and a traveling division of the museum. Felton was also involved in the representation of African-American history at American museums and cultural sites. In the early 1990s, Felton was instrumental in organizing day-long Juneteenth celebrations in Anacostia, which was an prominent step towards broader recognition of Juneteenth in Washington, D.C. Felton retired from the Anacostia museum in 1995, becoming Education Director Emeritus. Writing Felton co-authored two books with Gail S. Lowe. They first wrote the 1976 book A walk through \\"Old\\" Anacostia, which documents the historical region of Anacostia. In 1993, they published A different drummer: John Kinard and the Anacostia Museum. The book is a biography of John Kinard, the founding director of the Anacostia Community Museum and the first African American director of a Smithsonian museum, who had died in 1989. A different drummer is also a history of the early Anacostia Museum, and its role in the surrounding community. Awards In 1980, Felton was honored by Howard University for Outstanding Contributions to the Life and Culture of the Black Community. In June 1988, Felton was named one of America's Top 100 Black Business and Professional Women by Dollars & Sense magazine. In 1991, she received the EdCom Award for Excellence in Practice from the American Alliance of Museums. Felton was listed for many years in the Who's Who Among Black Americans, and was a winner of the Katherine Coffee Award. In 2009, the NAACP held a banquet for Felton and Constance Roberts Gates recognizing important firsts in education.

It is constructed in the light cone of a five dimensional manifold. Takahashi et. al., in 1988, began a study of Galilean symmetry, where an explicitly covariant non-relativistic field theory could be developed. The theory is constructed in the light cone of a (4,1) Minkowski space. Previously, in 1985, Duval et. al. constructed a similar tensor formulation in the context of Newton‚ÄìCartan theory. Some other authors also have developed a similar Galilean tensor formalism.  Galilean Manifold  The Galilei transformations are : \\\\textbf{x}' = R\\\\textbf{x} - \\\\textbf{v} t+ \\\\textbf{a} : t' = t+\\\\textbf{b} . where R stands for the three-dimensional Euclidean rotations, \\\\textbf{v} is the relative velocity determining Galilean boosts, a stands for spacial translations and b, for time translations. Consider a free mass particle m; the mass shell relation is given by p^2-2mE=0. We can then define a 5-vector, p^\\\\mu=(p_x,p_y,p_z,m,E)=(p_i,m,E), with i=1,2,3. Thus, we can define a scalar product of the type : p_\\\\mu p_ u g^{\\\\mu u}=p_ip_i-p_5p_4-p_4p_5=p^2-2mE=k, where : g^{\\\\mu u} = \\\\pm \\\\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0&0\\\\0&1&0&0&0\\\\0&0&1&0&0\\\\0&0&0&0&-1\\\\0&0&0&-1&0\\\\end{pmatrix}, is the metric of the space-time, and p_ u g^{\\\\mu u}=p^\\\\mu.  Extended Galilei Algebra  A five dimensional Poincar√© algebra leaves the metric g^{\\\\mu u} invariant, : [P_\\\\mu, P_ u] = 0, : \\\\frac{ 1 }{ i }~[M_{\\\\mu u}, P_\\\\rho] = g_{\\\\mu\\\\rho} P_ u - g_{ u\\\\rho} P_\\\\mu\\\\, : \\\\frac{ 1 }{ i }~[M_{\\\\mu u}, M_{\\\\rho\\\\sigma}] = g_{\\\\mu\\\\rho} M_{ u\\\\sigma} - g_{\\\\mu\\\\sigma} M_{ u\\\\rho} - g_{ u\\\\rho} M_{\\\\mu\\\\sigma} + \\\\eta_{ u\\\\sigma} M_{\\\\mu\\\\rho}\\\\, , We can write the generators as : J_i=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\epsilon_{ijk}M_{jk}, : K_i=M_{5i}, : C_i=M_{4i}, : D=M_{54}. The non-vanishing commutation relations will then be rewritten as : \\\\left[J_i,J_j\\\\right]=i\\\\epsilon_{ijk}J_k, : \\\\left[J_i,C_j\\\\right]=i\\\\epsilon_{ijk}C_k, : \\\\left[D,K_i\\\\right]=iK_i, : \\\\left[P_4,D\\\\right]=iP_4, : \\\\left[P_i,K_j\\\\right]=i\\\\delta_{ij}P_5, : \\\\left[P_4,K_i\\\\right]=iP_i, : \\\\left[P_5,D\\\\right]=-iP_5, : \\\\left[J_i,K_j\\\\right]=i\\\\epsilon_{ijk}K_k, : \\\\left[K_i,C_j\\\\right]=i\\\\delta_{ij}D+i\\\\epsilon_{ijk}J_k, : \\\\left[C_i,D\\\\right]=iC_i, : \\\\left[J_i,P_j\\\\right]=i\\\\epsilon_{ijk}P_k, : \\\\left[P_i,C_j\\\\right]=i\\\\delta_{ij}P_4, : \\\\left[P_5,C_i\\\\right]=iP_i. An important Lie subalgebra is : [P_4,P_i]=0 : [P_i,P_j]=0 : [J_i,P_4]=0 : [K_i,K_j]=0 : \\\\left[J_i,J_j\\\\right]=i\\\\epsilon_{ijk}J_k, : \\\\left[J_i,P_j\\\\right]=i\\\\epsilon_{ijk}P_k, : \\\\left[J_i,K_j\\\\right]=i\\\\epsilon_{ijk}K_k, : \\\\left[P_4,K_i\\\\right]=iP_i, : \\\\left[P_i,K_j\\\\right]=i\\\\delta_{ij}P_5, P_4 is the generator of time translations (Hamiltonian), Pi is the generator of spatial translations (momentum operator), K_i is the generator of Galilean boosts, and J_i stands for a generator of rotations (angular momentum operator). The generator P_5 is a Casimir invariant and P^2-2P_4P_5 is an additional Casimir invariant. This algebra is isomorphic to the extended Galilean Algebra in (3+1) dimensions with P_5=M, The central charge, interpreted as mass, and P_4=H. The third Casimir invariant is given by W_{\\\\mu\\\\,5}W^\\\\mu{}_5, where W_{\\\\mu u}=\\\\epsilon_{\\\\mu\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\rho u}P^{\\\\alpha}M^{\\\\beta\\\\rho} is a 5-dimensional analog of the Pauli‚ÄìLubanski pseudovector.  Bargmann structures  In 1985 Duval, Burdet and Kunzle showed that four-dimensional Newton‚ÄìCartan theory of gravitation can be reformulated as Kaluza‚ÄìKlein reduction of five-dimensional Einstein gravity along a null-like direction. The metric used is the same as the Galilean metric but with all positive entries :g^{\\\\mu u} = \\\\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0&0\\\\0&1&0&0&0\\\\0&0&1&0&0\\\\0&0&0&0&1\\\\0&0&0&1&0\\\\end{pmatrix}. This lifting is considered to be useful for non-relativistic holographic models. Gravitational models in this framework have shown to precisely calculate the mercury precession.

The film explores themes such as consumerism, feminism, and Jewish identity through the lens of a shopping mall.  Plot  The film follows the romantic lives of an ensemble of retail employees at a shopping mall. Sylvie, a coffee shop employee, pines for her boyfriend who has traveled to Labrador seeking fortune. Her customer Eli, an American man, reencounters Jeanne, a Jewish woman from Poland who had been his lover in the wake of World War II when he was stationed in France. He pursues her in an attempt to start a new life with her, but ultimately, Jeanne cannot bring herself to leave the life she built with her shopkeeper husband and her son Robert. Meanwhile, Pascale, a hairdresser, pines for Robert despite his love for the salon‚Äôs manager Lili. Robert is rejected by Lili for Monsieur Jean, the wealthy married man who owns the salon. Robert instead resolves to marry hairdresser Mado, but is caught in a final tryst with Lili by Pascale. Word of Robert‚Äôs infidelity spreads to everybody but Mado. When the news reaches Monsieur Schwartz, he tries to leverage it to make Monsieur Jean sell Lili‚Äôs salon to him so he can expand his shop. Enraged, Monsieur Jean violently confronts Lili in the salon. Eli and Lili leave the mall together. Months after these events, Robert now runs a boutique in the space formerly occupied by the salon and is set to marry Mado. On the eve of the wedding, Lili returns to the mall to proclaim her love for Robert. Mado catches the pair kissing in a fitting room and is distraught, running to Jeanne for comfort. Jeanne consoles Mado by telling her that she and Robert would not have been happy together and invites her to dinner with herself and her husband. As they leave the mall, they run into Eli and his new girlfriend.  Cast  * Delphine Seyrig as Jeanne Schwartz * Nicolas Tronc as Robert Schwartz * Fanny Cotten√ßon as Lili * Lio as Mado * Pascale Salkin as Pascale * John Berry as Eli * Jean- Fran√ßois Balmer as Monsieur Jean * Myriam Boyer as Sylvie * Charles Denner as Monsieur Schwartz  Production  Akerman had conceived Golden Eighties in the style of a Technicolor MGM musical. In part because this was such a departure from her earlier work, Akerman was unable to secure funding for the project. In 1983, the director released a documentary showcasing the movie‚Äôs early phases of production to attract investors. The first hour of the documentary feature, titled Les Annees 80s, featured scenes from rehearsals. The documentary continued with an abbreviated version of the musical followed by Akerman thanking her collaborators over 365-degree footage of Brussels. The director concluded the documentary with the phrase \\"Next year in Jerusalem\\". Although Les Annees 80s was poorly received at the 1983 New York Film Festival, Akerman eventually secured the funding she needed. Filming for the funded feature took place in Brussels over the course of eight weeks in 1985. Budget constraints resulted in a more modest production than Akerman had envisioned; for example, the choreography was simpler than she had hoped.  Release  Golden Eighties premiered at the 1986 Directors' Fortnight, a parallel section of the Cannes Film Festival. The film received a limited release in America on 17 April 1992 under the title Window Shopping to avoid confusion with Les Annees 80s, the musical‚Äôs making-of documentary which was released as Golden Eighties in the United States.  Reception  Golden Eighties enjoyed modest success in Belgium and France upon its original release. In a 1992 review for The New York Times, critic Vincent Canby described the film as an \\"unpretentious, absolutely charming romantic comedy- with-music, the small scale of which perfectly suits the passions of its characters\\".

A longtime manager and executive for several companies, he served as chairman of the of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation board of directors from 1912 until his death. Tripp was also a director of more than 20 other companies, including several Westinghouse subsidiaries. In 1917, Tripp's expertise in business and manufacturing led to his appointment as a major in the United States Army. Assigned as an assistant to the Army's Chief of Ordnance, he was promoted to brigadier general in 1918. At the end of the war, Tripp received the Army Distinguished Service Medal in recognition of his efforts to convert America's production capacity to wartime materiel. Tripp died in New York City following complications after intestinal surgery. He was buried at Old Tennent Churchyard in Tennent, New Jersey. Early life Guy Eastman Tripp was born in Wells, Maine on April 22, 1865, a son of Alonzo R. Tripp and Abbie (Yeaton) Tripp. He was educated in the schools of York County and in 1882 he graduated from Berwick Academy in South Berwick, Maine. After graduating, Tripp moved to Massachusetts to accept a position as a clerk with the Eastern Railroad, a position he held until 1890. Career Tripp left the Eastern Railroad to become a clerk with the Thomson- Houston Electric Company during the company's installation of a trolley system which replaced the city's horse-drawn streetcars. When Thomson-Houston and the Edison Electric Company combined to create General Electric (GE), Tripp joined GE as a traveling auditor. In 1895, he became an auditor for the Industrial Improvement Company, which operated electric street railways in several Northeastern cities, including Allentown, Pennsylvania and Haverhill, Lawrence, and Brockton, Massachusetts. In 1897, Tripp joined the Stone & Webster electrical engineering firm, which operated urban railways in several U.S. cities, including Seattle, Dallas, and Houston. Initially employed as a district manager, Tripp advanced through the company's ranks to become its president. In 1908, financial mismanagement of New York City's Metropolitan Street Railway System led to creation of the Joint Committee on reorganization, which was empowered to solve the company's problems and restore it to profitability. Tripp was hired as the commission's technical expert, and was soon appointed chairman of the commission. After the Joint Commission's work was complete in 1912, Tripp was appointed chairman of the board for the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, a position he held until his death. In addition to his work for Westinghouse Electric, Tripp was elected to the boards of directors of more than 20 other corporations, including several Westinghouse subsidiaries. A partial list includes: Westinghouse Lamp Company; Westinghouse, Church & Kerr Company; New York Railways Company; RCA; Chase National Bank; and the American Sugar Refining Company. World War I From the Army Ordnance Corps Association Hall of Fame With the War Department desiring to make use of Tripp's business and manufacturing expertise during World War I, in 1917 he was commissioned as a major in the United States Army. He was then appointed as chief of the Army's Ordnance Production Division. In 1918, Tripp was promoted to brigadier general and assigned as assistant to the Army's Chief of Ordnance. Tripp served until the end of the war in November 1918. In recognition of the technical expertise he provided during the Army's effort to convert America's manufacturing capacity to the production of wartime materiel, at the end of the war Tripp received the Army Distinguished Service Medal, which was presented by President Woodrow Wilson. After leaving the Army, Tripp returned to his business career, but continued to provide unofficial advice and guidance to the War Department. Tripp was later inducted into the Ordnance Corps Association's Hall of Fame. Later career Tripp continued to serve as chairman of the board at Westinghouse and as a board member for several other corporations. In 1923 and 1924, Tripp toured the world on a goodwill mission to enhance the development and growth of Westinghouse's international subsidiaries. He was favorably received, and received awards and recognition from several foreign governments, including Japan's Order of the Sacred Treasure, Second Class. In 1924, he received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Maine's Bates College. In addition to his career as a business executive, Tripp also authored several books and professional journal articles. His published works include Super-Power as an Aid to Progress (1924) and Electric Development as an Aid to Agriculture (1926). Death and burial In June 1927, Tripp underwent intestinal surgery at a New York City hospital. He developed post-surgical complications, which proved to be fatal. He died in New York City on June 14, 1927. Tripp's funeral was held at the Unitarian Church of All Souls in Manhattan. His honorary pallbearers included Charles M. Schwab, Nicholas Frederic Brady, George B. Cortelyou, and Major General Clarence C. Williams. Tripp was buried at Old Tennent Cemetery in Manalapan Township, New Jersey. Family In 1887, Tripp married Mary Elaine O'Connell of Salem, Massachusetts. She was usually known as Elaine, and they were the parents of daughters Mary, Olive, and Adah. Mary Tripp was the wife of Clifford Hemphill of New York, Olive the wife of Nelson Gatch of St. Louis, and Adah was the wife of first Gordon Fischer and then Arthur D. Forst of Trenton, New Jersey.

Guardado ran from two uniformed police officers into an alley, where he died after being shot by deputies. Seven shots were fired and Guardado was hit in the upper torso. Police say that Guardado produced a handgun during the chase. Investigators do not believe it was fired. Accounts of the incident are disputed between police and witnesses. Police stated they were searching for footage of the incident. Store-owner Andrew Heney reported that several cameras at the scene, including a digital video recorder that stored surveillance footage, were taken and destroyed by police. Local protests emerged in response to the killing of Guardado and involved protestors and media reporters being tear gassed and shot by rubber bullets at the sheriff's station in Compton. The incident was widely reported as the second police killing involving the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies within two days of one another, the other being Terron Jammal Boone, who was identified as the half-brother of 24-year-old Robert Fuller. Guardado's death came in the wake of the killing of George Floyd and subsequent protests.  Background  Photo of Andres Guardado Guardado's family had fled violence and political instability in El Salvador from the Salvadoran Civil War. Guardado lived with his family in Koreatown, Los Angeles and had recently graduated high school. He was working two jobs and was a student at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College to become a registered electrician or mechanic. He was described by friends and family as fun-loving and optimistic. Guardado worked as an unlicensed security guard for Street Dynamic Auto Body in Gardena. The Bureau of Security and Investigative Services, which licenses security guards in the state of California, show no records in the Department of Consumer Affairs database of Guardado being licensed to work security. Being younger than twenty-one, Guardado did not hold a firearms permit to be an armed security guard.  Incident  Police accounts of the incident relay that at 5:52 p.m. on June 18 two officers from the Compton Sheriff's station made contact with Guardado. They were reportedly out on patrol when they saw Guardado talking to someone in a car blocking a driveway, so they stopped their vehicle. Police say that Guardado ran away and allegedly produced a firearm at some point in the chase, although this is disputed by his family and employer. The chase was taken southbound on Redondo Beach Blvd. and through a nearby alleyway. At around 5:53 p.m., Guardado was shot at six times by one or multiple sheriff's deputies and hit in the upper body. Guardado died on scene. Store-owner Andrew Heney stated that Guardado \\"got down on his knees and surrendered with his hands behind his head but was still shot seven times in the back.\\" The shooting occurred near a business located in the 400 block of Redondo Beach Boulevard near S. Figueroa Street. A gun was reportedly recovered on the scene. The gun recovered at the scene was a \\"ghost gun\\" (a term used to describe an illegal firearm with no serial numbers imprinted on the gun) with a high capacity magazine. Both of those are felonies in the state of California. It was unclear what \\"prompted the use of force\\" and what Guardado was \\"suspected of\\" to initially prompt the chase. Heney stated, \\"the police came up, and they pulled their guns on him and he ran because he was scared, and they shot and killed him. He‚Äôs got a clean background and everything. There‚Äôs no reason.\\" A witness on the scene stated, \\"I turned around and saw two male white officers running up into the body shop where not even less than a second later I heard rapid gunshots, [I heard] about four to five shots fired [and] never heard them say ‚Äòfreeze‚Äô. I never once heard them say 'stop.' Nothing like that.\\" The deputies reportedly were not wearing body cameras. Lt. Charles Calderaro stated that deputies \\"are hoping to find surveillance video from nearby businesses.\\" The sheriff's officers are accused of destroying several cameras at the scene and taking possession of the DVR that stored footage filmed by the surveillance cameras. In an interview, Heney is quoted as saying that the deputies \\"illegally got into everything, then they had the place locked down and then they got the warrant.\\".  Reactions = Community  A small group, including Guardado's family, quickly gathered on scene after he was shot and killed. The scene became intense when family members showed up and became distraught at the news of Guardado's death. Deputies could be seen \\"shoving people away, including a man carrying a child.\\" Family and local activists were devastated and outraged by the incident, who state that Guardado was shot in the back several times by the police. His sister, Jennifer Guardado, stated: \\"Even if this is the last day I breathe, I'm not holding this back because I feel it in my soul that my brother was murdered, and this was covered up.\\" Prominent Los Angeles activist Najee Ali referred to the killing as an execution and \\"a continuation of the L.A. County sheriff's murdering black and brown men.\\" Ali stated that \\"he ran away because he did what all young Black and Latino men do sometimes when they see the police: They run. They run because they're scared for their lives. They run because they know their lives might be at risk, and he knew exactly what was gonna happen. And sure enough, he died.\\" By Friday June 19, \\"a makeshift memorial for Guardado grew outside the store where he worked, with people stopping by to hang posters and leave flowers and candles.\\" A protest was organized by Union del Barrio. Stanley Leiba, Guardado's childhood friend stated \\"You expect kids you grow up with to live forever.\\" On June 21, about 500 people showed up at the intersection of Figueroa Street and West Redondo Beach Boulevard to protest. One person stated, \\"We are marching because we're tired of this corruption. We know that boy was no threat. Black lives matter. Brown lives matter. We are going to keep marching until justice is served.\\" Salvadoran flags were waved at the protest while protestors chanted \\"Why'd you kill that kid?\\" Protestors were reportedly tear gassed and shot with rubber bullets after tensions heightened. Six people were arrested.  Government  Compton City Attorney Damon Brown reported that the city sent a letter to the sheriff's department, \\"demanding that it remove the involved deputies from the Compton station and replace them with \\"officers who would treat our residents with the respect and dignity that they deserve.'\\" Congresswoman Nanette Barrag√°n and Maxine Waters called upon Xavier Becerra, the Attorney General of California, to conduct a full independent investigation into the shooting. In a joint statement, the congresswomen stated, \\"Another day and another Black or Brown kid has been shot in the back by police. These killings must stop. We demand it. The American people demand it ... Change must come now. For weeks, the American people and the world have marched to demand accountability, put an end to aggressive and violent police tactics and equal justice for Black and Brown communities. We must show them their pleas are being heard. Now. That begins with making sure we get justice for Andres Guardado.\\" This was described as an expression of Black-brown unity. At a press event, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva spoke out against conducting an independent investigation, stating \\"that the attorney general's office did not have the resources to investigate every shooting.\\" LA County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas also called for an independent investigation, supported by the Guardado family.  Press reports and public statements  Los Angeles Times investigative reporters wrote the two deputies who were involved in the chase and shooting were Miguel Vega, who opened fire, and Chris Hernandez, who did not shoot. Vega has a history of allegations, mostly unproven or yet to be resolved, including tampering with evidence, making false statements to investigators (an action for which he was given a four-day suspension) and complaints for use of unreasonable force. Neither officer has yet given a statement to investigators and have separate attorneys representing them, according to the LA Times report. CNN reported that Vega's lawyer is most often associated with the policeman's union in Los Angeles. Neither officer has yet officially given a reason for the use of deadly force, although Hernandez' lawyer Tom You has told CNN that Andres Guardado was prone on the ground when he was shot. The lawyer claims Hernandez told investigators the following: \\"Guardado prones out, he's on the ground but he has access to his firearm. My client can see (only) half of Guardado's body because his view is blocked by a wall. Because Guardado is not listening to commands and reaches for the firearm, Vega is in fear for his life.\\" According to reports from the Los Angeles Times, the homicide investigators requested a security hold on the autopsy until all interviews were completed. Panish Shea & Boyle, the law firm representing Andres Guardado's family released a statement demanding the release of Andres Guardado's autopsy results after the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department placed a security hold on them. The coroner's office as well as an independent autopsy determined Guardado's cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds and the manner of death was certified as homicide. The final autopsy also showed that Guardado was shot in the back five times.  Autopsy reports  An \\"emergency hold\\" was placed on the autopsy report by Sheriff Villanueva, preventing the release of details pending the conclusion of the investigation conducted by the Homicide division of the LASD.https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/family-young-latino-fatally-shot- sheriff-s-deputy-want- autopsy-n1232533https://www.facebook.com/LosAngelesCountySheriffsDepartment/videos/265228008245799/ An independent autopsy released by Guardado's family shows Andres Guardado was shot 5 times in the back.https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/independent- autopsy-andres-guardado-finds-he-was-fatally-shot-five-n1233157  Whistleblower  According to a sworn testimony of a whistle blower, Guardado was murdered by the police as part of an initiation into a violent police gang within the department, The Executioners.

MBSJ are responsible for the public's health and sanitation, waste removal and management, town planning, environmental protection and building control, social and economic development and general maintenance functions of urban infrastructure. The MBSJ headquarters is located in UEP Subang Jaya.  History  In the 1970s the Selangor state government established the Petaling District Council (Majlis Daerah Petaling, MDP) under section 4 of the Local Government Act 1976. In 1994, the state government decided to upgrade the authority to the status of a municipal council (majlis perbandaran), and rename it the Subang Jaya Municipal Council. The Subang Jaya Municipal Council was formed on 1 January 1997, by combining the existing Petaling District Council with several areas ceded from the Petaling Jaya Municipal Council (MPPJ) and Shah Alam Municipal Council (MPSA). In December 2019, the Subang Jaya Municipal Council was granted the approval from the federal government to elevate its status from a City Council to become Subang Jaya City Council (MBSJ), which was gazetted on 20 October 2020.

Construction  Commandant Bultinck was built at the Smith's Dock Co. Ltd. shipyard in Middlesbrough, United Kingdom in 1911. Where she was launched and completed that same year. The ship was long, had a beam of and had a depth of . She was assessed at and had 1 x 3 cyl. triple expansion engine driving a single screw propeller.  Sinking  Commandant Bultinck was sailing in the Irish Sea when on 2 October 1929, she got caught in a storm with winds up to 80 mph and lightning, which drove her to shore and ran her aground at Rossall Point near Fleetwood, Lancashire, United Kingdom barely missing a breakwater. She was spotted on the beach by a number of passengers on a tramcar at 23 pm, who quickly alerted the Fleetwood harbormaster. The lifeboat headquarters at Blackpool were also informed of the wreck and chartered their lifeboat by horse to the wrecksite. By the time the rescuers arrived, a large crowd had followed them to the site, where the harbormaster said that the lifeboat would be useless as the wreck lay in very shallow waters surrounded by big waves. The rescuers waited on the shore until 4 am as they saw how another lifeboat with other rescuers tried in vain to reach the wreck before having to return to Fleetwood for shelter against the storm. Meanwhile the Commandant Bultinck endured wave after wave crashing over her deck as she lay broadside to the shore, with her crew holding onto the tilted deck. Ultimately a mate called Celestine Tratsaert (aged 23) attempted to swim for the shore while wearing a lifebelt and holding onto a rope which could be used afterwards to rescue the remaining 11 crewmen. He was however no match for the sea as he was swept under the stranded vessel and drowned. The crew ended up attempting to reach shore a second time as an apprentice named Willie Van Yper (aged 17) and boatswain Pieter Luyens (aged 24) jumped into the sea while wearing lifebelts. If this time the pair would be successful in traversing the to shore, it was proposed that another apprentice would follow in their wake so eventually the whole ship could be safely evacuated. The crowd, who was still present alongside the rescuers, could only watch as the two men struggled in the raging sea when they suddenly disappeared from sight, meeting the same fate as the mate before them. By this time one of the teachers from the nearby Rossall School arrived on the scene with a megaphone. He was the only person who knew some Flemish and helped to communicate with the stricken Flemish crew who didn't know any English. The crew of Commandant Bultinck were reluctant to enter the water again as the two previous attempts failed and claimed the lives of three of their fellow crewmen. Instead they waited until low tide when the rescuers were finally able to reach the ship and assist the remaining crew into getting ashore. The nine surviving crewmen were taking to the Royal National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen's Hostel in Fleetwood. The fish catch aboard Commandant Bultinck was also lost as all the ice aboard for preservation had been washed out by the seawater.  Wreck  The wreck of Commandant Bultinck lay nearly completely dry at low tide, but several attempts to refloat her were made. But even after holes were cut in the ship to make her lighter, she still failed to be refloated. Ultimately Commandant Bultinck was scrapped on site.

These included mapping a gene controlling the average sugar content of sweet sorghum and identifying quantitative trait loci controlling the chemical composition of sorghum leaves and stems.  High Throughput Phenotyping  Murray's quantitative genetics research lead him to the conclusion that individual genes were not effective at predicting the yield of corn and so he instead began to focus on the \\"phenome\\" of corn, using UAVs and image analysis to track how corn develops over time. In 2017, Murray organized the launch of a new journal sponsored by the Crop Science Society of America and the American Society of Agronomy called The Plant Phenome Journal. He currently serves as the lead editor for this journal.  Developing New Corn Varieties  Murray's breeding program at Texas A&M; is evaluating roughly seven thousand new varieties of corn each year.https://today.tamu.edu/2019/06/14/building-a-better-bourbon/ His breeding program is focused on producing corn varieties which are more tolerant of stresses and more resistant to the molds that produce aflatoxin.

A BQS is a commonly used Loss Control tool to track significant variances of cargo quantities between the supplier and receiver. Since bunker fuel is often the largest financial cost driver to the operation of a vessel, a BQS is considered a critical service to ensure correct quantities of fuel are delivered.  Purpose  Due to the dynamic location of vessels, particularly those involved in Maritime transport, the physical transfer of fuel (Bunkering) often takes place thousands of miles from each party's contracting offices. As such, neither the buyer or seller is usually present to witness the physical transfer and procedures involved, thus any quantity or procedural dispute is often futile and inconclusive. When such disputes arise, they can create unnecessary protests, legal fees, demurrage, loss of management time, and loss of good will for all stakeholders. A BQS performed by an impartial party can alleviate many of the stressors involved in the purchase and sale of bunker fuel, and ensure both parties are treated fairly from a financial standpoint.  Methods  While the specific methods of measuring liquid hydrocarbons, and subsequently a BQS, can vary based on circumstances such as location, available equipment, and accessibility, the general principals converge to certain key procedures. While each BQS provider may vary within the methodology, the underlying procedures are typically involve measuring the cargo volumes and temperatures on both the supplying and receiving vessels before and after the cargo transfer.  Assessments = Quantitative  Quantitative assessments in Bunker Quantity Surveys involve physical, measurable, and quantifiable variables of bunker fuel and delivery. These aspects revolve around temperature, density, volume, and their respective methods of calculation. The quantitative assessment of fuel quantity audits and surveys are typically what one would expect from a BQS, as such variables can be both physically measured and independently verified. Most BQS services focus primarily, and often exclusively, on the quantitative aspects, as they focus on the general principles of thermodynamics and follow international standardized methods, thus can often be referenced without protest by both parties.  Qualitative  As a relatively newer method in quantity based surveys, qualitative assessments in BQS focus more on the conditional and dependent aspects of each operation. Such methods focus on human error, local regulations and procedures, and financial cost drivers and ratios. These methods are often used in conjunction with the quantitative assessments mentioned earlier to provide a more holistic survey as opposed to a strict quantity inspection. Qualitative assessments are used primarily when the BQS is requested by one party only (as opposed to both), and focus on reducing operational costs for the client.  Importance  While a BQS is not always a legal requirement when taking bunker fuel, the service plays an important role in managing the continuity of relationships between fuel suppliers and consumers. Depending on where the fuel transfer operation takes place, different global ports have varying concerns when pertaining to the quantity of fuel delivered. While out right pilferage may be a common practice in some ports, thus citing an essential need for a BQS, procedural concerns may also warrant a BQS in ports where pilferage is not as common. Regardless of specific operational needs, BQS services are typically held in high regard as the cost to perform the surveys are often a small and insignificant cost relative to the overall cost of the fuel.

Formed in January 1941 in Osaka, Japan, the brigade consisted of a single infantry regiment and support elements. It undertook occupation duties in Indochina before being sent to Malaya and then Rabaul. In late 1942, the brigade was sent to take part in the Battle of Buna‚ÄìGona in New Guinea. It was withdrawn to Rabaul, and then Japan, in June 1943. Elements of the brigade were converted into other formations and the formation ceased to exist in July 1943. History The 21st IMB was established to be used in the occupation of French Indochina. It was formed in Osaka, Japan, from the 170th Infantry Regiment, which was detached from the 140th Division in January 1941. Its commander was Major General Yamagata Tsuyuo. It consisted of a single, three battalion infantry regiment, which was unique amongst the other Japanese mixed brigades. In addition, it was supported by a company of tanks, a field hospital, anti-aircraft company, signals, a mountain artillery regiment and engineers. In total it consisted of about 3,700 troops. This was much smaller than the 1st to 20th IMBs, which had been established between 1937 and 1940 to occupy Japanese-held areas of China and had a strength of about 4,900 officers and men. Commencing in May 1942, the brigade undertook occupation duties in Hanoi following the Japanese invasion of French Indochina, as part of the Southern Army. This was followed by a move to Malaya and then Rabaul at the end of the year, although the brigade's motor transport remained in Indochina. The 21st IMB arrived at Rabaul on 22 November; at this time it had not seen combat. Map depicting the movements of Japanese forces, including the 21st IMB At Rabaul, the brigade came under operational control of the 8th Area Army and it was subsequently tasked with reinforcing Japanese troops in the Buna‚ÄìGona area, in New Guinea. After leaving their horses in Rabaul, the movement was undertaken aboard several destroyers, and was carried out over the course of several trips in late November and early December, which were severely disrupted by Allied air attack. Some elements of the brigade were lost during the reinforcement movement including the barge carrying the 170th Infantry Regiment's commander and its regimental flag. Consequently, the brigade's troops were scattered over several areas (the Mambare River, the Kumusi, Giruwa), before concentrating around Napapo, to the west of Gona. In New Guinea, the brigade's commander assumed control of all 18th Army (less the South Seas Detachment) units around Buna, Giruwa, and Basabua, joining with the 41st Infantry Regiment to form the Buna Detachment. The 21st IMB then fought against the US troops advancing from Buna to the west during the Battle of Buna‚ÄìGona. The brigade took heavy casualties during the subsequent fighting. Around January 1943, the Japanese began evacuating Giruwa and elements of the brigade, totalling about 270 troops, withdrew to the Kumusi River. While the I and III Battalions of the 170th Infantry Regiment served in New Guinea, the regiment's II Battalion was deployed to Wake Island and was eventually subsumed into the 13th Infantry Regiment. By June 1943, the brigade was withdrawn to Rabaul and then ordered to return to Japan; its armoured, artillery and anti-aircraft elements were re-designated as independent units and dispersed, while the brigade was disbanded in July 1943. The brigade's commander was subsequently reassigned to a garrison unit in Kyoto.

Williams, Pietro Bembo on Etna: The Ascent of a Venetian Humanist (Oxford University Press, 2017), p. 279. Paduan years Bembo was the son of Nicol√≤ Bembo and Elisabetta di Andrea Paruta. He studied philosophy at the University of Padua, earning a bachelor of arts degree under the guidance of Gaetano da Thiene on 10 November 1455. He continued to study law thereafter, finally earning his doctor of both laws degree on 19 January 1465. He continued to live in Padua until 1468.Matteo Soranzo, Giovanni Aurelio Augurello (1441‚Äì1524) and Renaissance Alchemy: A Critical Edition of Chrysopeia and Other Alchemical Poems, with an Introduction, English Translation and Commentary (Brill, 2020), pp. 15‚Äì20. During his Paduan period, he visited Rome as part of a congratulatory embassy to Pope Calixtus III (1455), delivered congratulations to Doge Cristoforo Moro on behalf of the law students (1462) and delivered the eulogy at the funeral for Bertoldo d'Este (8 March 1464). He married his first wife, Elena di Matteo of the Morosini family, in 1462.Margaret L. King, Venetian Humanism in an Age of Patrician Dominance (Princeton University Press, 2014 [1985]), pp. 335‚Äì339. Widowed, he married a second time to Elena Marcello, the mother of Pietro. Diplomat and statesman Bembo was the Venetian ambassador to the court of Henry IV of Castile in 1468‚Äì1469. On 16 July 1471, he was commissioned as ambassador to Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. On 18 June 1472, he signed the Treaty of P√©ronne, creating a five- year alliance between Venice and Burgundy. After a three-year stay at the Burgundian court, he was appointed ambassador to Sigismund, Archduke of Austria, on 23 August 1474. This mission, if it was in fact undertaken, was not fruitful and he returned to Venice before the end of the year. There he was one of the 41 ducal electors chosen to select the doge. Pietro Mocenigo was elected. Bembo was appointed ambassador to Florence on 23 December 1474. In this capacity, he promised Lorenzo de' Medici to do his best to procure the return of the bones of Dante Alighieri to Florence. He returned to Venice in 1476, but was reappointed in July 1478 following the Pazzi conspiracy, presumably because of his friendship with Lorenzo. His second ambassadorship in Florence ended in 1480. Between 1481 and 1483, Bembo was the podest√† and capitano del popolo of Ravenna. In this capacity he renovated the tomb of Dante, commissioning Pietro Lombardo to carve a portrait for it.Nella Giannetto, \\"Bembo, Bernardo\\", in The Oxford Companion to Italian Literature (Oxford University Press, 2002). For this he was praised in an epigram of Cristoforo Landino. The latter part of his term in Ravenna was taken up by the War of Ferrara, which began in May 1482. On 9 July 1483, Bembo was appointed ambassador to England. On 13 February 1484, he was made ambassador to France. No details about either mission survive, although Domenico Malipiero in his Annali says that Bembo went to England. He had returned to Venice by early 1485, when he was elected one of four ambassadors to pay homage to Pope Innocent VIII. He served a first term as avogadore di comun (public prosecutor) in 1486, a role he reprised another five times (1494‚Äì1495, 1500, 1504‚Äì1505, 1509‚Äì1510, 1512‚Äì1513). Bembo was tried for fiscal improprieties and acquitted by the Council of Ten on 22 October 1487. He returned to Rome in November 1487 as the Venetian representative at the papal arbitration of the Republic's dispute with Sigismund of Austria, which had led to the brief War of Rovereto in the Tyrol. He was still in Rome in October 1488, when he was elected podest√† of Bergamo. He served for two years (1489‚Äì1490), during which he revised the municipal statutes. In October 1492, he was chosen by the Senate to be a member of the zonta (an extraordinary commission of the senate), a position in which he served uninterrupted for many years. On 1 October 1496, he joined the Council of Ten. He conveyed to the council the offer of Tristano Savorgnan to poison Charles VIII of France, then invading Italy. The Council rejected the proposal. His term was cut short by his appointment as visdomino of Ferrara in July or August 1497. As visdomino, Bembo reported on the anti-Venetian hostility of Ercole d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, yet he also forwarded to Venice Ercole's offer to mediate the end of the Pisan War, in which Venice had taken the side of Pisa against Florence. Ercole issued his award, detrimental to Venice, on 26 April 1499. Bembo reported to the College in Venice on 21 July 1499. On 15 November, he was elected to the Dieci Savi. In 1500, he rejoined the Council of Ten and was its head in March and May. Between August and December 1500, he was a governatore delle entrate. On 30 September 1501, Bembo was a ducal elector in the election that chose Leonardo Loredan. From 10 April 1502 until mid-1503 he was podest√† of Verona, in conjunction with which he was also to act as ambassador to King Louis XII of France, who was invading Italy. For this reason he was away from Verona between 15 June and 28 August 1502, first at Pavia and from 27 July at Milan. He describes the triumphal entry of Louis XII in Milan in a letter to Marino Sanuto the Younger. In Verona, he entertained Francesco Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua, and his wife, Isabella d'Este. Final embassy and last years in Venice On 11 November 1503, Bembo was selected for the embassy of congratulation to Pope Julius II on his election, but for political reasons related to the downfall of Cesare Borgia it did not set out until March 1505. In the interim he served as avogadore di comun. He wrote an account of this embassy valuable for its description of Rome's antiquities. This was his last embassy and he spent the rest of his life in Venice except for some short visits to Padua. He was never very wealthy, but he did own land in the Terraferma near Padua. From October 1505 until August 1506, Bembo sat on the Council of Ten. He left to take up the post of provveditore of fodder, and the Council elected him to its zonta (extraordinary commission) on 8 August. His term as avogadore in 1510‚Äì1511 following the battle of Agnadello was eventful. With Marino Giustinian and Alvise Gradenigo, he proposed the review of Antonio Grimani's exile that brought back the military to Venice at a time of need. He also sat on the commission that tried the Paduans for rebellion, and launched the trial of Angelo Trevisan before the Great Council on 20 February 1510. In August 1510, Bembo rejoined the Council of Ten. He fought hard for but lost election as podest√† of Padua in November. Marino Sanuto considered scandalous to find such \\"ambition ... in the aged\\". It is likely that financial need more than ambition motivated Bembo. He often appears as an insolvent debtor of the state in these years. On 1 December, he joined the Ducal Council. On 11 July 1511, he was elected again to the Council of Ten. This time he was unable to fully take part in its proceedings and was so ill for a time that Pietro came to visit him. From 10 May 1512 until 23 May 1513 he was avogadore. He was elected to the Council of Ten for a last time on 9 October and served one year. His last term was active and he was frequently head of the council. In late 1514 he withdrew from public life. Tee failure in December 1514 of his son's mission on behalf of Pope Leo X to Venice seems to have dispirited Bembo. He rejected re-election to the zonta of the Senate. He fell ill on 19 May 1519. Pietro learned of his father's illness at Bologna, but did not arrive in Venice before his death on 28 May. He was buried in the church of San Salvador on 30 May. Correspondence and writings Bembo corresponded with Lorenzo de' Medici, Cristoforo Landino, Dante III Alighieri, Ermolao Barbaro, Pietro Barozzi, Baldassarre Castiglione, Marsilio Ficino, Francesco Filelfo, Lauro Quirini, Marcantonio Sabellico, Antonio Vinciguerra and Jacopo Zeno. He wrote mostly speeches and letters in Latin. Sanuto praises him as \\"most learned, great in humanitas\\" and says that he continued to write until his last hour, always \\"well-composed and full of all erudition\\". Among his surviving writings are: *Gratulatio ad Christophorum Maurum pro clarissimo divini atque humani iuris scolasticorum ordine Patavini habita (1462), his congratulation to Cristoforo Moro *Oratio in adventu cardinalis Sancti Angeli legati apostolici (1460) *Oratio in adventu Jacobi Zeni episcopi Patavini (1460) *Oratio in funere Bertholdi marchionis Estensis, his eulogy for Bertoldo d'Este, with a consolatio to his widow Jacoba (1464) *Orationes ad Innocentium VIII (1487‚Äì1488), three orations delivered before Innocent VIII during his second embassy to him *a zibaldone Bembo amassed a large library. He has been seen, along with Girolamo Donato and Ermolao Barbaro, as representative of late 15th-century Venetian humanism. More than any other Venetian humanist he was familiar with the thinking current at Florence. ReferencesFurther reading *Giannetto, Nella. Bernardo Bembo: umanista e politico veneziano. Leo S.

Wheeler Wildlife Management Area is a brackish tidal marsh, nature preserve and hunting area owned by the state of Connecticut located in Devon (village), Milford, New Haven County, Connecticut. The Charles E. Wheeler WMA is located on the eastern shore (Milford side) of the mouth of the Housatonic River. It is protected from Long Island Sound by a barrier beach known as Milford Point. The main channel of the Housatonic River flows north and south to the west of the Charles E. Wheeler WMA, however a substantial amount of the water flows into and through the estuary itself particularly with the tide. The US Army Corp of Engineers dredged the Housatonic River channel between the WMA and Stratford in both 1976 and 2012. Without dredging, sediment from upriver would expand the Nells Island salt marsh area into the main channel of the river, obstructing recreational boating and commercial shipping. Flora Most of the WMA's wetlands, both those covered and those exposed at high tide, are covered with plants. The primary fauna are a low marsh smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora Loisel) and a high marsh saltmeadow cordgrass (Spartina patens Aiton). The genus Spartina was merged into the genus Sporobolus in 2014 (based on research in the journal Taxon) but a report in the journal Ecology in 2019 (authored by an interdisciplinary team of experts) supported the creation of the separate genus Spartina. Fauna 800px Along with the Milford Point barrier beach and associated sand bars, the WMA is one of the most important migratory bird stopover areas on Long Island Sound, particularly for shorebirds. The WMA is a refuge for ducks, geese, swans and many other migratory birds. There are also insects, crustaceans, fish and mammals. Recreation Hunting, fishing, bird watching, photography and boating are all popular recreational pursuits in the WMA. Hunting (of waterfowl only) is only allowed in season with permits. Motorized and non- motorized watercraft are permitted and used for hunting, fishing and recreation (particularly kayaks, canoes, stand up paddleboards (SUPs) and rowboats with shallow drafts and narrow beams for deftly navigating the tidal creeks and estuarine channels). Dangers to consider when visiting the WMA : * Timing the tides in order to enter and leave the WMA by watercraft is a critical issue. * It is easy to become lost in a maze of passages and miss the time window for leaving the WMA. * The powerful tides can also create strong currents at critical choke points in the marsh. The best time to enter and explore the WMA is at (or better yet, just before) high tide. The narrowness and shallowness of the marsh channels and creek passages is a \\"deep\\" concern. While many marsh creeks are navigable at high tide, many of the waterways inside the WMA become mud flats at low tide, which are extremely difficult to traverse. High tide in Long Island Sound off Milford, as well as Short Beach in Stratford, is several minutes ahead of high tide in the WMA. Access Sea Kayaking at high tide in Charles E Wheeler WMA Access to the Charles E. Wheeler WMA is only possible from the water (e.g. watercraft) though there are several locations for viewing the salt marshes from the shore of Milford Point, the Connecticut Audubon Society Coastal Center or the Milford Conservation Land Trust property (\\"Nancy's Meadow\\") at the intersection of First Avenue and Milford Point Road in Devon's Laurel Beach neighborhood. For both viewing the marshes and launching watercraft there are several car trailer and \\"cartop\\" launches near the WMA: * The closest and easiest access to the WMA is an unimproved state boat launch and parking for cars and boat trailers with an unpaved road entrance at the Second Avenue end of Court Street in Milford, Connecticut. It is operated by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. * Also very close is a very limited public access location (with no dedicated parking) at the end of Deerwood Avenue near the junction with Third Avenue in Milford. * On the Housatonic River one half mile north of the WMA is the Housatonic River State Boat Launch and parking lot under the I-95 bridge at the end of Naugatuck Avenue in Milford. Convenient to Interstate 95. Launching watercraft from the Connecticut Audubon Society Coastal center is prohibited. Launching from the Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge Milford Point Unit is difficult as there is no public road access (only a private road and beach) though landing there temporarily is allowed. The speed of vessels in the Charles E. Wheeler WMA is restricted by the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies TITLE 15. Navigation and Aeronautics, specifically the DEEP Boating Safety section: > ¬ß15-121-B15m.

Topology Several islands are a part of the Charles E. Wheeler Wildlife Management Area: * Duck Island * Nells Island The adjacent Connecticut Audubon Society Coastal Center at Milford Point and Smith-Hubbell Wildlife Refuge & Bird Sanctuary focuses on conservation education with displays about area wildlife and meeting rooms. The Coastal Center offers educational programs, demonstrations, and workshops about wildlife (in particular migratory birds). Outside there are demonstration sites, self-guided hiking trails to the sand bars and beaches of Long Island Sound as well as to the WMA, both an observation tower and deck, bird houses and outdoor education classrooms. Milford Point (also known as the Milford Point Unit), the curved peninsula barrier beach \\"arm\\" protecting the Charles E. Wheeler Wildlife Management Area, is one of eight units that make up the Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge which are administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. As one of the most important migratory bird stopover areas on Long Island Sound, a majority of the 8.5 acre Milford Point is protected from human contact for much of the year to protect nesting areas of the Piping Plover threatened bird species. Several semi-permanent sand bars in Long Island Sound are located just off Milford Point and some connect to Milford Point, particularly at low tide. History Charles E. (Shang) Wheeler (1872-1949) was a Connecticut state senator and representative, outdoorsman, conservationist and celebrated amateur decoy carver as well as the general manager of the Connecticut Oyster Farms Company from 1912 to 1946) in nearby Milford, Connecticut. According to the Milford Hall of Fame website, \\"Shang\\" Wheeler was also a \\"superior football player, amateur boxer, a nationally known breeder of Llewellyn setters, a champion fly caster who also created many new flies, and a political cartoonist.\\" as well as a \\"among the nation's leading experts on oysters and their cultivation,\\". Born in Westport, Fairfield, Connecticut, United States, he lived in Stratford, Fairfield, Connecticut, United States. He was a Republican member of the Connecticut House of Representatives from Stratford from 1923 to 1926 and a member of the Connecticut State Senate 25th District in 1927 to 1928 as well as from 1939 to 1940. In 1953 a Special Act of the Connecticut General Assembly placed Nell's Island under the jurisdiction and control of the State Board of Fisheries and Game. In 1955 a Special Act of the Connecticut General Assembly changed the name of Nell's Island to the Charles E. Wheeler Wildlife Management Area. The WMA was named for Charles (Shang) Wheeler because of his work on conservation as well as to preserve the wetlands in the mouth of the Housatonic River as well as his fundraising work in 1935 to upgrade the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries lab at Milford Harbor which had been established in 1918 to study shellfish in Long Island Sound. In 1951 the Lab named a research vessel the R/V Shang Wheeler, which it used until 2001. The Milford Lab is now under NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service and is known as a part of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center. By 1950, the Housatonic River near the area then known as the \\"Milford Marsh\\" and Nells Island was in danger of \\"silting\\" in. On Wednesday, January 25, 1950 the United States House Committee on Appropriations of the 81st Congress held a hearing before the subcommittee on Deficiencies and Army Civil Functions regarding Department of Army Appropriations for 1951. Several Connecticut business leaders as well as government commissions and conservation groups had filed written recommendations to the US Congress to fund the \\"Housatonic River Dredging Project, Devon, Conn.\\" to dredge the river channel but also pleaded with the committee not to dump the dredged material in Nells Island and the adjacent marshlands. In 1976 and 2012 the Housatonic River channel between the WMA and Stratford was also dredged to keep the WMA's marshlands from expanding into the main channel of the river.

It has enjoyed an exponential surge in popularity since the early 2010s, quickly making Estonia a hotbed of the sport, together with Finland. In the PDGA's Year-End Demographic Report for 2019, Estonia had 930 active members, 135 courses, and organized 44 PDGA-sanctioned events. In June 2020, there were 864 active PDGA members and 628 expired memberships. The surge in disc golf popularity in Estonia is generally attributed to its close proximity to disc golf hubs around the Baltic Sea, namely Finland and Sweden. Rene Mengel, Estonian disc golf pioneer and the country's main disc golf promoter, attributes the success of the sport to a large number of disc golf courses throughout the country, and to the fact that disc golf discs can be purchased from local retail stores in Estonia in addition to specialized online retailers, helping make the sport accessible. ;Number of PDGA members at Year-End. ;Number of Courses at Year- End. ;Number of Events at Year-End.

Bijli Pasi ruled a part of the present- day state of Uttar Pradesh. Life Historical evidence regarding the existence or life of Bijli Pasi remains obscure. In 2000, the Department of Posts, Government of India, led by Ram Vilas Paswan (the previous Minister of Post), issued a commemorative stamp to honor the social and political influence of the Pasi caste movement. In this commemorative stamp, Bijli Pasi was credited with founding the city of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh. He was also described as being contemporaneous to Prithviraj Chauhan. According to this particular stamp, he consolidated his position when Northern India was divided into several small states, before the fall of the mighty empires of the past. In popular culture Maharaja Bijli Pasi is credited with the founding of Bijnor, (now a small town near Lucknow), and was an enlightened ruler who consolidated his position and established his reign over a large tract of land in the region of Bijnor. As recorded in the British Gazetteers of the eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries, he was a contemporary of Prithiviraj Chauhan. He was an able leader of the \\"Pasis\\", a fiercely independent people indigenous to the locality. The commemoration of Bijli Pasi gave voice to the claims of Dalits that in the past there were Dalit kings and that they had had a glorious history just like upper castes. The warrior image of Maharaja, often seen upon the walls of various Dalit communities (especially people of Pasi Caste) was designed as per the suggestion of Kanshi Ram, the founder of the Bahujan Samaj Party. He wanted the image to contain the features of five Sikh gurus who are also worshipped by Dalit communities to date.

He gave strong support to and usually followed the advice of his foreign ministers, Lord Clarendon, (1868-70), Lord Granville, (1870-1874, 1880‚Äì1885) and Earl Rosebery (1886, 1892-1894).Paul Knaplund, Gladstone's Foreign Policy (1935). For his career generally see William Ewart Gladstone .  Principles of foreign-policy  In 1879, when he was out of office, he expounded on \\"the right policies of foreign-policy.\\" These included the preservation of peace, the love of liberty, and respect for the equal rights of all nations. Gladstone most famously expressed his policies and terms of the oppression of the Neapolitans in 1851, the Bulgarians in 1876, and the Armenians oppressed by the Turks. In 1879 in the Midlothian campaign he attacked Disraeli's leadership, emphasizing the simple moral principle with his typical religious approach: :Remember the rights of the savage as we call him. Remember that...the sanctity of human life in the hill villages of Afghanistan among the winter snows, is as inviolable in the eye of Almighty God as can be your own. Remember that...mutual love is not limited by the shores of this island, is not limited by the boundaries of Christian civilization, that it passes over the whole surface of the earth and embraces the meanest along with the greatest in his unmeasured scope.Roland Quinault, Afghanistan and Gladstone's Moral Foreign Policy.

He was a leading advocate of free trade and low tariffs. Gladstone's budget of 1860 was introduced on 10 February along with the Cobden‚ÄìChevalier Treaty between Britain and France that would reduce tariffs between the two countries.Asaana A. Iliasu, \\"The Cobden-Chevalier commercial treaty of 1860.\\" Historical Journal 14.1 (1971): 67-98 online. This budget \\"marked the final adoption of the Free Trade principle, that taxation should be levied for Revenue purposes alone, and that every protective, differential, or discriminating duty ... should be dislodged\\".Buxton, p. 195. At the beginning of 1859, there were 419 duties in existence. The 1860 budget reduced the number of duties to 48, with 15 duties constituting the majority of the revenue. To finance these reductions in indirect taxation, the income tax, instead of being abolished, was raised to 10d. for incomes above ¬£150 and at 7d. for incomes above ¬£100.Sir Wemyss Reid, ed., The Life of William Ewart Gladstone (1899), p. 421. As Chancellor of the Exchequer during wartime, he insisted on raising taxes and not borrowing funds to pay for the war. The goal was to turn wealthy Britons against expensive wars. Britain entered the Crimean War in February 1854, and Gladstone introduced his budget on 6 March. Gladstone had to increase expenditure on the military and a vote of credit of ¬£1,250,000 was taken to send a force of 25,000 to the front. The deficit for the year would be ¬£2,840,000 (estimated revenue ¬£56,680,000; estimated expenditure ¬£59,420,000). Gladstone refused to borrow the money needed to rectify this deficit and instead increased income tax by half, from sevenpence to tenpence-halfpenny in the pound (from 2.92% to 4.38%). By May another ¬£6,870,000 was needed for the war and Gladstone raised the income tax from tenpence halfpenny to fourteen pence in the pound to raise ¬£3,250,000. Spirits, malt, and sugar were taxed to raise the rest of the money needed.Sydney Buxton, Finance and Politics: An Historical Study, 1783‚Äì1885. Volume I (1888), pp. 150‚Äì51. He proclaimed: :The expenses of a war are the moral check which it has pleased the Almighty to impose upon the ambition and lust of conquest that are inherent in so many nations ... The necessity of meeting from year to year the expenditure which it entails is a salutary and wholesome check, making them feel what they are about, and making them measure the cost of the benefit upon which they may calculateOlive Anderson, \\"Loans versus taxes: British financial policy in the Crimean War.\\" Economic History Review (1963): 314-327 at p. 314. However he did float ¬£6 million in bonds, and his successor borrowed much more. p. 315‚Äì17. online. Opium trade British traders had developed a highly profitable business of purchasing opium in British India, and selling it on the China market. When the Chinese government tried to shut it down, foreign minister Lord Palmerston sent in the Royal Navy. It used brute force to reopen the market in 1840. Gladstone, whose own sister at this time was addicted to opium, was outraged. He supported Robert Peel‚Äôs motion to denounce the trade and the government support. Gladstone a 30-year-old ally of Peel and the Whig coalition, argued that the Chinese government had the right to stop British traders, on account of their: :obstinacy in persisting with this infamous and atrocious traffic....Justice in my opinion, is with them; and whilst they, the Pagans, the semi-civilized barbarians have it on their side, we, the enlightened and civilized Christians, are pursuing objects at variance both with justice and with religion....A war more unjust in its origin, or calculated in its progress to cover the country with a permanent disgrace, I do not know and I've not read of....[our] flag is become a pirate flag to protect an infamous traffic.W Travis Hanes III and FrankSanello, The opium wars: the addiction of one empire and the corruption of another‚Äô‚Äô (2002) pp 78-79. Peel's vote of censure against the government's handling of the opium war was defeated in the House of Commons by a vote of 262 in favour and 271 against.Hanes and Sanello, p. 79 He repeated opinions when the second war with China broke out in 1857. There was no glory he said in fighting China--it was more like making war on women and children. The basis of British trade there was injustice and that would never do. Britain should be guided by principles of mercy, peace and justice toward China. Gladstone was on the winning side of this vote, alongside Disraeli. Knaplund, p.7; Shannon, Gladstone 1:333. Relations with Palmerston Although Gladstone served under Lord Palmerston in several capacities, the two very strong personalities clashed profoundly. Especially in foreign policy, each man considered the other to be a dangerous demagogue. To Gladstone, Palmerston was a chauvinist who deliberately excited public opinion against foreign adversaries. Palmerston felt Gladstone's religiosity and sincere declarations of principle were a matter of cant or excessive religious enthusiasm. Palmerston was annoyed that Gladstone was so successful in using enthusiasm, passion, sympathy and simplicity and building public support, especially when he was out of office. Herbert C. F. Bell, Lord Palmerston (1936) 2:234. They both supported Italy and worked together on that issue but they were driven apart on issues of Army, Navy, and finance. Gladstone was the little Englander who believed in international conciliation and peace, and build his base upon the middle-class businessmen who demanded low taxes and economy in government expenditures. Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer (1852‚Äì1855 and 1859‚Äì1866) repeatedly tried to cut back on naval and military budgets. In dramatic contrast Palmerston was an adventurer in foreign policy who demanded that England be respected and feared in every foreign capital, a policy that demanded an expensive Royal Navy ready for action. Bell, 2:235. The two men disagreed fundamentally about morality applied to foreign affairs, and defense spending , as well as religious issues and democratic reform.Jasper Ridley, Lord Palmerston (1970) p. 565. Prime minister 1868‚Äì1874 When Gladstone began his first ministry December 1, 1868, his attention focused on domestic issues and the Irish question. With the fall of the Conservative government in 1869, Gladstone set up a strong liberal and named George Villiers, Lord Clarendon, (1800-70) as his foreign minister. Lord Clarendon had years of diplomatic experience as a Whig but had broken with the Conservatives. He stated that his foreign policy would not change in essence, but he was cautious in European relations. John Bloomfield, ambassador to Austria, 1860-71, kept London apprised regarding Austria, France, and Prussia and warned about the risk of war between France and Prussia. He pointed to French threats against Belgium,. which Britain was obligated by treaty to defend. Britain diplomatically intervened to ease the tense situation between Prussia and Austria.Paul Knaplund, Gladstone's foreign policy (1935) ch 1-3. Philip Magnus, Gladstone: a biography (1954) pp 194‚Äì95. The major outstanding international issue was relations with the United States and the wake of the American Civil War, and the emerging effort of Irish Catholic Fenians based in the United States to attack Canada. The main issues were settled by international arbitration, whereby London paid $15.5 million to Washington for war damages caused by Confederate ships built in Britain.Ward and Gooch, eds., The Cambridge History of British Foreign Policy, 1783‚Äì1919 3:54‚Äì71.Adrian Cook, The Alabama Claims ((1975). In terms of the British Empire, there were small movements in Asia and Africa that for the moment demanded minimal attention from Gladstone. He opposed expansion in the South Pacific and the Malay Peninsula, although there was attention to the Fiji Islands and an increase in British influence in Malaya.W. D. McIntyre, \\"Disraeli's colonial policy: The creation of the Western Pacific High Commission, 1874‚Äì1877.\\" Historical Studies: Australia and New Zealand 9#35 (1960): 279-294. https://doi.org/10.1080/10314616008595177 The scramble for Africa to characterize the 1880s and not yet begun. Britain had small coastal holdings in both the East and West, and a successful war against the Ashanti led to the acquisition of lands in the Gold Coast. Diamonds were discovered in South Africa, dramatically increasing the economic importance of the region. A level of tension between the Boers and the British in South Africa was slowly increasing. Knaplund, p 40 Germany European affairs soon came to the fore, as Prussia, under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, defeated Denmark in a complicated war, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire as well. War between Prussia and France was looming, and British public opinion considered France the aggressor and generally supported Germany. Queen Elizabeth had very strong German ties, and was sharply hostile to France. Gladstone told the Queen that it was important that Britain not act alone in interventions in European affairs, but only act in concert with other powers. He was not knowledgeable about European affairs, and showed no interest in intervening. As the tensions escalated between Berlin and Paris, Gladstone took a strong position that warn both sides, especially France, against an invasion of Belgium. Neither side had any such plans, and both promised to honor Belgian neutrality.Knaplund. 28-39.Ward and Gooch, eds., The Cambridge History of British Foreign Policy, 1783‚Äì1919 3:21‚Äì43. Gladstone was angry at German seizure of Alsace-Lorraine from France in 1871, without giving the inhabitants a voice. British public opinion, and even the Queen, agreed with him. However in the 1870s and 1880s, apart from the 1875 'war in sight' false alarm, Britain and Germany were usually in agreement over European problems. Both made it a high priority to preserve the peace; both were suspicious of the ambitions of France and Russia. Bismarck ridiculed Gladstone's liberal trust in a concert of Europe, as well as his efforts to promote democracy in Britain and end power-politics abroad. Bismarck saw his own manipulation of power politics as the best guarantee of peace, not realizing how Kaiser William II would misuse German power after 1890.Paul M. Kennedy, \\"Idealists and realists: British views of Germany, 1864-1939.\\" Transactions of the Royal Historical Society 25 (1975): 137-156. online Before going to war, Bismarck had arranged for neutrality of Russia. Russian now took advantage by disavowing the Treaty of Paris (1856) provisions that neutralized its naval forces on the Black Sea. Gladstone was angry that Russia acted alone in rejecting any treaty provisions. He called a conference that met in London, November 1870 to March 1871. It acknowledged the fait accompli Russia had achieved but reaffirmed the strongly held views of Gladstone on the sanctity of treaties. The conference officially stated as an, \\"essential principle of the law of nations that no Power can liberate itself from the engagements of the treaty, nor modify the stipulations thereof, unless with the consent of the contracting Powers by means of an amicable agreement.\\"Knaplund, p. 64 Ward and Gooch, eds., The Cambridge History of British Foreign Policy, 1783‚Äì1919 3:44, 51‚Äì53. Cardwell reforms the army The Cardwell Reforms were a series of reforms of the British Army undertaken by Secretary of State for War Edward Cardwell between 1868 and 1874 with the Gladstone's support. Usually Gladstone paid scant attention to military affairs but he was keen on efficiency and cost-cutting. In 1870, he pushed through Parliament major changes in Army organisation. Prussia's stunning triumph over France in the Franco-Prussian War proved that the Prussian system of professional soldiers with up-to-date weapons was far superior to the traditional system of gentlemen-soldiers that Britain used.Robert Ensor, England, 1870‚Äì1914 (1936) pp. 7‚Äì17 The most important of Caldwell's reforms were the Army Enlistment Act of 1870, Regulation of the Forces Act of 1871, and the localization scheme of 1872. They provided the foundation for the late Victorian Army: short service, a reserve, and a comprehensive regimental system based on the local depot. He made other reforms as well such as the abolition of flogging in peace time, an increase in pay, and some improvement in living conditions. In 1871 he began the first large-scale maneuvers.Correlli Barnett, Britain and her army 1509-1970: a military, political and social survey (1970) pp 299‚Äì324 at p. 309. The reforms were not radical; they had been brewing for years and Gladstone seized the moment to enact them. The goal was to centralise the power of the War Office, abolish the purchase of officers' commissions, and create reserve forces stationed in Britain by establishing short terms of service for enlisted men. By far the controversial element was ending the purchase system. The rich families of young officers invested millions of pounds in the commissions and when a man was promoted he sold his junior commission to help pay for the more expensive senior commission. Legislation in Commons would reimburse the officers for their full purchase price. However the measure was defeated, whereupon the government announced that all purchases were abolished, thereby destroying the value of all of those commissions. The House of Lords passed the remedial legislation and the final expenditure made by officers was reimbursed but purchase was never reinstated.Albert V. Tucker, \\"Army and Society in England 1870‚Äì1900: A Reassessment of the Cardwell Reforms,\\" Journal of British Studies (1963) 2#2 pp. 110‚Äì141 in JSTOR These reforms started to turn British forces into an effective imperial force capable of fighting a modern European army. The defeat of Gladstone's government in 1874 put Cardwell out of office, but his reforms stayed in place despite attempts from the Regular Army to abolish them and return to the comfortable and familiar old post-1815 situation. The main obstacle had been objections by the defunct British East India Company and its executors, who wished to maintain their own military establishment, and by the \\"die-hards\\", senior officers who opposed almost any reform on principle. The arch-conservatives were led by the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, who was Queen Victoria's cousin and head of the Army from 1856 to 1895.Thomas F.

They point out that Lord Cambridge blocked many other reforms, such as the adoption of a general staff system as pioneered by the successful Prussian army. Albert V.

Theodore Hoppen says these reforms were: :at best partial, at worst ineffective....No planning department was established and no chief of staff appointed to set out the purpose and strategy of the army as a whole because politicians, Civil Servants, and soldiers all proved reluctant to take seriously the idea that Britain could ever again be involved in a large scale European war.

Prime minister 1880‚Äì1884 and 1885=Granville as Foreign Minister Lord Granville served as foreign secretary (1870‚Äì1874 and 1880‚Äì1885). His Gladstonian foreign policy based on patience, peace, and no alliances kept Britain free from European wars. It brought better relations with the United States, and it was innovative in supporting Gladstone's wish to settlement British-American fisheries and Civil War disputes over the Confederate cruisers built in Britain, like the Alabama, through international arbitration in 1872. For example, the long-standing San Juan Island Water Boundary Dispute in Puget Sound, which had been left ambiguous in the Oregon Treaty of 1846 to salve relations and get a treaty sorting out the primary differences, was arbitrated by the German Emperor also in 1872. In putting British-American relations up to the world as a model for how to resolve disputes peacefully, Granville helped create a breakthrough in international relations. Richard Shannon, Gladstone: Heroic Minister, 1865‚Äì1898 (1999) pp: 75, 113‚Äì14. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 broke out within a few days after Granville in the House of Lords quoted the opinion of the permanent under- secretary (Edmund Hammond) that \\"he had never known so great a lull in foreign affairs.\\" Russia took advantage of the situation to denounce the Black Sea clauses of the Treaty of Paris, and Lord Granville's protest was ineffectual. In 1871 an intermediate zone between Asiatic Russia and Afghanistan was agreed on between him and Shuvalov; but in 1873 Russia took possession of the Khanate of Khiva, within the neutral zone, and Lord Granville had to accept the aggression (See also: The Great Game). When the Conservatives came into power in 1874, Granville stepped down as Foreign Minister. His role for the next six years was to criticise Disraeli's \\"spirited\\" foreign policy, and to defend his own more pliant methods. He returned to the foreign office in 1880, only to find an anti-British spirit developing in German policy which the temporising methods of the Liberal leaders were generally powerless to deal with.Encyclopaedia Britannica (1911) 12:362 Spanish issues copy ex \\"Spain‚ÄìUnited Kingdom relations\\" During 1865-76 Britain sought to calm the Iberian Peninsula. The issues were many: Spain tried to unite with Portugal; there was internal strife in Spain over the throne; and France and Germany argued over the Spanish succession in 1870. Furthermore there was a \\"War-in- Sight\\" crisis of 1875, problems in Morocco, religious intolerance, and the usual issues of trade, which British merchants dominated. London opposed the union of Spain and Portugal because it wanted to keep Portugal as a loyal ally with its strategic location in the Atlantic. Britain held Gibraltar but it was not yet a fully satisfactory base. The unsuccessful attempts after September 1868 to find a successor to Queen Isabella who would satisfy the French, Germans, Portuguese, Austrians, Italians, and Spanish kept British diplomats busy with peacemaking moves in many capitals. With British help, Spain slowly ceded control of Morocco to France. Spanish anti-Protestant intolerance troubled British merchants and bankers, so Spain softened religious intolerance. For the most part British diplomats were able to defuse tensions and defend British interests in the Peninsula. C.J. Bartlett, \\"After Palmerston: Britain and the Iberian Peninsula, 1865-76.\\" English Historical Review 109.430 (1994): 74-88. online Ottoman Empire copy ex \\"International relations of the Great Powers (1814‚Äì1919)\\" After 1800 the Ottoman Empire steadily weakened militarily, and lost most of its holdings in Europe (starting with Greece) and in North Africa, starting with Egypt. Its great enemy was Russia, while its chief supporter was Britain.Donald Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700‚Äì1922 (2000).Rich, Great Power Diplomacy: 1814‚Äì1914 (1992) pp. 69‚Äì77. As the 19th century progressed the Ottoman Empire grew weaker and Britain increasingly became its chief ally and protector, even fighting the Crimean War in the 1850s to help it against Russia. Three British leaders played major roles. Lord Palmerston, who in the 1830‚Äì1865 era considered the Ottoman Empire an essential component in the balance of power, was the most favourable toward Constantinople. William Gladstone in the 1870s sought to build a Concert of Europe that would support the survival of the empire. In the 1880s and 1890s Lord Salisbury contemplated an orderly dismemberment of it, in such a way as to reduce rivalry between the greater powers.David Steele, \\"Three British Prime Ministers and the Survival of the Ottoman Empire, 1855‚Äì1902\\". Middle Eastern Studies 50.1 (2014): 43‚Äì60. The Berlin Conference on Africa of 1884 was, except for the abortive Hague Conference of 1899, the last great international political summit before 1914. Gladstone stood alone in advocating concerted instead of individual action regarding the internal administration of Egypt, the reform of the Ottoman empire, and the opening-up of Africa. Bismarck and Lord Salisbury rejected Gladstone‚Äôs position and were more representative of the consensus. Gladstone abandoned Salisbury‚Äôs Ottoman policy; withdrew the military consuls; and disregarded several British guarantees to the Porte. He did not return Cyprus.F.H. Hinsley, ed., New Cambridge Modern History: 1870-1898 (1962) vol 11 pp. 38, 45, 550, 553. ‚ÄúSplendid isolation‚Äù was the term used to characterize the British policy of operating without alliances. The worst moment came in spring 1885, when the Russians defeated the Afghans along their frontier. London feared Russia would invade Afghanistan and threatened India from the north. Gladstone secured a vote of credit from Parliament, in preparation for a war with Russia. His strategy was to send the Royal Navy through The Straits into the Black Sea and threatened Russia. However the Ottoman officials, strongly supported by all the European powers, refused to allow passage. It was the most formidable display of Continental hostility to Britain between Napoleon's day and Hitler's. Russia, however, had no interest in conquering Afghanistan and that tension was peacefully settled with Afghanistan remaining a buffer state.F.H. Hinsley, ed., New Cambridge Modern History: 1870-1898 (1962) vol 11 p 558 Takeover of Egypt, 1882 copy ex \\"International relations of the Great Powers (1814‚Äì1919)\\" The most decisive event emerged from the Anglo-Egyptian War, which resulted in the British occupation of Egypt for seven decades, even though the Ottoman Empire retained nominal ownership until 1914.M.W. Daly, ed. The Cambridge History Of Egypt Volume 2 Modern Egypt, from 1517 to the end of the twentieth century (1998) online France was seriously unhappy, having lost control of the canal that it built and financed and had dreamed of for decades. Germany, Austria, Russia, and Italy ‚Äì and of course the Ottoman Empire itself-- were all angered by London's unilateral intervention. Britain insisted over and over that the Porte was still sovereign and the occupation of Egypt was temporary. A complete takeover of Egypt, turning it into a British colony like India was much too dangerous for it would be the signal for the powers to rush in for the spoils of the tottering Ottoman Empire, with a major war a likely result.A.P. Thornton, \\"Rivalries in the Mediterranean, the Middle East and Egypt.\\" in The New Cambridge Modern History (1962) v 11 p 587.David Steele, \\"Three British Prime Ministers and the Survival of the Ottoman Empire, 1855‚Äì1902.\\" Middle Eastern Studies 50.1 (2014): 43-60 at p. 57. Historian A.J.P. Taylor says that this \\"was a great event; indeed, the only real event in international relations between the Battle of Sedan and the defeat of Russia in the Russo-Japanese war.\\"He adds, \\"All the rest were maneuvers which left the combatants at the close of the day exactly where they had started.\\" A.J.P. Taylor, \\"International Relations\\" in F.H. Hinsley, ed., The New Cambridge Modern History: XI: Material Progress and World-Wide Problems, 1870‚Äì98 (1962): 554. Taylor emphasizes the long-term impact: :The British occupation of Egypt altered the balance of power. It not only gave the British security for their route to India; it made them masters of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East; it made it unnecessary for them to stand in the front line against Russia at the Straits....And thus prepared the way for the Franco-Russian Alliance ten years later.Taylor, \\"International Relations\\" p 554 Gladstone and his Liberal Party had a reputation for strong opposition to imperialism, so historians have long debated the explanation for this sudden reversal of policy.R.C. Mowat \\"From Liberalism to Imperialism: The Case of Egypt 1875‚Äì1887\\", Historical Journal 16#1 (1973), pp. 109-12 The most influential was study by John Robinson and Ronald Gallagher, Africa and the Victorians (1961), which focused on The Imperialism of Free Trade and was promoted by the Cambridge School of historiography. They argue there was no long-term Liberal plan in support of imperialism, but the urgent necessity to act to protect the Suez Canal was decisive in the face of what appeared to be a radical collapse of law and order, and a nationalist revolt focused on expelling the Europeans, regardless of the damage it would do to international trade and the British Empire. Gladstone's decision came against strained relations with France, and maneuvering by \\"men on the spot\\" in Egypt. Critics such as Cain and Hopkins have stressed the need to protect large sums invested by British financiers and Egyptian bonds, while downplaying the risk to the viability of the Suez Canal. Unlike the Marxists, they stress \\"gentlemanly\\" financial and commercial interests, not the industrial, capitalism that Marxists believe was always central.Peter J. Cain and Anthony G. Hopkins, \\"Gentlemanly capitalism and British expansion overseas II: new imperialism, 1850‚Äê1945.\\" Economic History Review 40.1 (1987): 1-26. online More recently, specialists on Egypt have been interested primarily in the internal dynamics among Egyptians that produce the failed Urabi Revolt.Donald Malcolm Reid, The 'Urabi revolution and the British conquest, 1879‚Äì1882 in M .

Prime minister 1892‚Äì1894 In December 1893 an Opposition motion called for an expansion of the Royal Navy. Shannon, 2: 551‚Äì55. Gladstone opposed increasing public expenditure on the naval estimates, in the tradition of free trade liberalism of his earlier political career as Chancellor. Gladstone's tax reductions had been facilitated by the naval economies; his final act of resignation (1894) was precipitated by his inability to prolong the period of naval economy when he discovered that almost all his colleagues supported expansion of the Royal Navy. C.J. Bartlett, \\"The Mid-Victorian Reappraisal of Naval Policy\\" in Studies in international history: essays presented to W. Norton Medlicott (Longmans, 1967) pp 189-208.

It is currently located at 1 Moonah Place in the Yarralumla suburb of south Canberra, just beyond the periphery of Parliament House. History Although diplomatic relations between the Philippines and Australia were established in May 1946, the Philippines did not establish a presence in the country until three years later, when Roberto Regala, at the time serving as Consul General at the Philippine Consulate General in San Francisco, being appointed by President Elpidio Quirino as consul to Australia on July 8, 1949. Regala's appointment was subsequently accepted by the Australian government a month later, and he was elevated to the rank of minister the following year. Despite there being a consul ‚Äî and later minister ‚Äî to Australia, the Philippines did not have a mission in Canberra; at the time, the country's interests were represented through the Philippine Consulate General in Sydney. For a time, the Consulate was upgraded to an embassy in 1956 with the naming of Jose Imperial as the first resident Philippine ambassador to Australia. The Embassy was then moved to Canberra in 1962, with Imperial's successor, Mariano Ezpeleta, becoming the first Philippine ambassador to reside in the city. The Embassy has seen itself become the subject of scandal in 2018, when the ABC News investigative program Four Corners found that a former ambassador to Australia had exploited a Filipino worker, and in 2020, when it had been accused on social media of calling in for questioning a certain person who had criticized President Rodrigo Duterte ‚Äî a charge which it subsequently denied. Building The buildings of the Philippine Embassy in Canberra were designed by noted Filipino architect Federico Ilustre, who had also designed the chancery of the Philippine Embassy in New Delhi, alongside the Australian firm Moir and Slater. Construction began in 1962, and it was opened on Philippine Independence Day, June 12, 1964, with both the chancery and the ambassadorial residence being located within the same compound. Staff and activities The Philippine Embassy in Canberra is currently headed by Ambassador Ma. Hellen Barber de la Vega, who was appointed to the position by President Duterte on June 7, 2018. Prior to becoming Ambassador, de la Vega, a career diplomat, served as Assistant Secretary at the Department of Foreign Affairs Office of ASEAN Affairs, and prior to that headed the Philippine Consulate General in Los Angeles and the Philippine Embassy in Yangon. Her appointment was confirmed by the Commission on Appointments on August 15, 2018, and she presented her credentials to Governor General Peter Cosgrove on November 29, 2018. Notable diplomats who have been deployed to the Embassy as Ambassadors to Australia include Leticia Ramos Shahani, who would later become Senator, and future Foreign Affairs Secretary Delia Albert. Many of the Embassy's activities center around fostering continuing relations between the Philippines and Australia, and in particular with respect to the more than 300,000 Filipino Australians. These include organizing a lecture on the discovery of Homo luzonensis, hosting the Loboc Children's Choir during its tour of Australia, and facilitating cultural exchanges between the two countries. It also works closely with Filipino communities and community organizations throughout Australia, particularly during natural disasters, and also works with government agencies in the Philippines to ensure the welfare of Filipinos coming to Australia.

Selections from Totems have been exhibited to critical acclaim in solo exhibitions in New York and New England in 2011 and 2012. Of the Totems photographs, Perl writes: ‚ÄúKayafas‚Äôs explorations of an endangered vernacular architecture are at once straightforward records and unabashedly poetic meditations, a matter of the photographer testing the quality of his attentiveness against the facts on the ground. The lyric impulse is sharpened by the documentary convention.‚Äù  Mexico City  Mexico City is a collection of photographs that were made by Kayafas between 2012 and 2016.

The famines are a result of the 2019‚Äì20 locust infestation, the COVID-19 recession and measures taken to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ongoing wars and political turmoil in some nations are also considered to be local causes. It is projected by Oxfam that by the end of 2020 \\"12,000 people per day could die from COVID-19 linked hunger\\", with the United Nations stating that a total of 265 million people face acute food insecurity ‚Äì an increase of 135 million people as a result of the pandemic. Altogether, at least 10% and as much as 20% of the global population is believed to be affected in some form or another due to famines caused in 2020. The famines are widely considered to be the worst series of famines since the Great Chinese Famine in 1959‚Äì61, and is projected to be among the worst famines in human history. The chief of the World Food Programme has warned that without continued financial support from western nations, the 30 million people supported by the programme are at risk of death as a result of food insecurity in 2020. However, only a few nations have actually increased their funding, and it is believed none are significant enough to stop the crisis. The new locust wave spreading across Africa in June 2020 also has sparked fears that supply shortages, especially in nations like Syria, Yemen, India and Ethiopia may escalate the famine in their regions. On 9 July, Oxfam released a report highlighting ten areas of \\"extreme hunger\\" alongside \\"emerging epicentres\\" of hunger, including areas in South America, Africa, the Middle East and South Asia.  Background  2019 Global Hunger Index by Severity  Locust infestations  Exceptional weather patterns in 2018, including heavy rain, resulted in exponential growth of the desert locust population in the Arabian Peninsula and Horn of Africa during 2019. Locusts form swarms which then go on to destroy crops, reducing food availability for both livestock and humans. The Food and Agriculture Organization and World Bank state that 23 countries have been affected by locust infestation and an estimated US$8.5 billion in asset damages alone. An estimated 24 million people in associated regions were estimated to have poor food security in July 2020.  COVID-19 pandemic  Following the international spread of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, and thus its associated illness coronavirus disease 2019, several national governments implemented national lockdowns and international travel restrictions in order to prevent the spread of the disease. As a result of these precautions and panic buying, shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic considerably rose whilst aid delivery capabilities and remittances from high-income nations fell. Simultaneously, many poorer workers in low- and middle-income nations also lost their jobs or ability to farm as a result of these lockdowns, whilst children could not receive school meals due to the education shutdown across much of the world. A confirmed people have died directly from COVID-19, but Oxfam indicated in their July 2020 report that when including those who have died as a result of lack of food, this number is considerably higher.  Armed conflicts  Several armed conflicts and displacement crises are ongoing, including those associated with the Yemeni Civil War, Syrian Civil War, insurgency in the Maghreb, Russo-Ukrainian War and Afghanistan conflict. Food production and transport through areas in armed conflicts is poor, and both armed and political conflict results in large displacements including refugees of the Syrian Civil War and the Venezuelan refugee crisis. As a result, these areas are more vulnerable to famine and food insecurity is high.  Global Report on Food Crises  On 21 April, the United Nations World Food Programme warned that a famine \\"of biblical proportions\\" was expected in several parts of the world as a result of the pandemic. The release of 2020 Global Report on Food Crises indicated that 55 countries were at risk, with David Beasley estimating that in a worst-case scenario \\"about three dozen\\" countries would succumb to famine. The United Nations forecasts that the following member states will have significant areas with poor food security categorised as under \\"stress\\" (IPC phase 2), \\"crisis\\" (IPC phase 3), \\"emergency\\" (IPC phase 4) or \\"critical emergency\\" (IPC phase 5) in 2020: It also raises alerts around: An asterisk (*) indicates that country is considered to be an \\"extreme hunger\\" hotspot by Oxfam, as indicated in the July 2020 Oxfam report. These ten key areas of \\"extreme hunger\\" that account for 65% of the total population facing crisis- level hunger (IPC phase 3 or above) include Afghanistan, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen and the West African Sahel (including Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal). It also noted \\"emerging epicentres\\" of hunger, alongside famine-stricken areas, in Brazil, India, Yemen, South Africa and the Sahel. The United Nations has made an \\"urgent call\\" to improve data analytics in several countries which may be at risk, including Congo, North Korea, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, the Philippines and Sri Lanka.  Impact by area = Americas  Brazil = Brazil has been classified as an \\"emerging epicentre\\" of hunger by Oxfam. 38 million people in Brazil are part of the informal economy, with the vast majority entering unemployment as a result of local lockdowns. Several favelas have had poor water supply or water supply cut off during the pandemic, exacerbating worries about access to food and water. In March 2020, the National Congress of Brazil approved a payment plan of 600 reais (US$114) to informal workers. However, this has been criticised by Caritas, with the Brazilian executive director stating \\"now, it is just about food\\". = Haiti = Haiti has been classified as an \\"extreme hunger\\" hotspot by Oxfam. Haiti has been in recession for 1.5 years, with the cost of rice doubling since 2019. A drop in remittances, which account for 20% of the nation's GDP, as a result of an increase in unemployment in the United States and other western nations alongside has exacerbated the crisis. Half of all Haitian jobs are in agriculture, which has been severely hit by the pandemic. Pre-pandemic, the United Nations had forecast that 40% of Haitians would rely on international aid for food, and it is expected that this number will rise. = United States  Food availability  Damage to the Cub Foods grocery store sustained during riots in Minneapolis, Minnesota Following protests against police brutality and associated civil unrest, some cities experienced lack of food. This unrest can accelerate the flight of businesses in areas where the expectation of safe operation is low. For example, in Chicago's South Side communities, there were few choices for groceries as most stores closed in order to prevent looting. In Minneapolis when protests against police brutality started, some neighbourhoods saw looting and vandalism. Lake Street suffered from a food desert with few grocery stores, pharmacies and other essential businesses open. These issues are compounded by local lockdowns, with many businesses also closed because of the pandemic.  Remittances  The United States is the world's largest source of remittances, and money sent from workers in the United States abroad to low and middle income nations is vital for the economies of recipient nations. In 2019, remittances from the United States and other western nations accounts for a large proportion of many national GDP values, most notably Tonga (37.6%), Haiti (37.1%), South Sudan (34.1%), Kyrgyzstan (29.2%), and Tajikistan (28.2%). However, the World Bank forecasts that remittances are expected to drop 19.7% to US$445 billion, which it states represents \\"a loss of a crucial financing lifeline for many vulnerable households\\" requiring many to redirect savings away from education towards solving food shortages. It is likely that this drop in remittance is associated with the lockdown and recession in western nations, such as the United States, which increase joblessness and prevent many from sending money to families in their home countries. This is likely to add additional strain in areas at risk of food insecurity, especially in nations facing other crises. = Venezuela = Venezuela has been classified as an \\"extreme hunger\\" hotspot by Oxfam. Heightened political turmoil and extreme food shortages have led to the largest refugee crisis in the Americas. Both those in Venezuela and those fleeing to neighbouring countries, such as Colombia and Ecuador, have been identified as at high risk of food insecurity. The United Nations has identified that at least one-third of the remaining population in Venezuela do not have enough food to sustain themselves. These shortages have been economically exacerbated by a fall in the price of oil as a result of the 2020 Russia‚ÄìSaudi Arabia oil price war. 74% of Venezuelan families have adopted coping strategies to deal with the shortage of food, including eating less and accepting food as payment.  East Africa  East Africa as a region is highly vulnerable due to the locust infestations that have recently plagued the area. Nations such as Ethiopia, Sudan, South Sudan have been fighting food insecurity since the 2019-20 locust infestations began in June 2019 and are \\"extreme hunger\\" hotspots. One in five of all acutely food-insecure people live in the Intergovernmental Authority on Development region. = Ethiopia = Ethiopia has been classified as an \\"extreme hunger\\" hotspot by Oxfam. Alongside the locust infestation and pandemic, Ethiopia faces insecurity due to conflict, extreme weather and long-lasting economic shock.  Middle East  Syria = Syrians have been facing acute food insecurity as a result of the Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011. An estimated 17 million people in Syria ‚Äì more than 50% of the remaining population ‚Äì are considered acutely food insecure, with an additional 2.2 million at risk. Refugees of the Syrian Civil War are also at risk high risk of being food-insecure, with refugee camps in neighbouring Turkey and Lebanon highlighted as greatly at-risk by the United Nations. In June 2020, an international donor conference raised US$5.5 billion for humanitarian assistance in Syria. = Yemen = Yemen is one the most food-insecure countries in the world, with an estimated 2 million children under five suffering from acute malnutrition. Belligerents have been accused of embargoing or blockading food for civilians, likely as a result of general scarcity of resources. Yemen has also been affected by the locust infestation as well as a cholera outbreak alongside the COVID-19 pandemic. The combined effects of these disasters has resulted in an exceptional humanitarian crisis. Before the pandemic in 2019, the United Nations had estimated 20 million Yemenis were acutely food insecure and another 10 million were at very high risk. The United Nations has requested US$2.4 billion in funds to help prevent widespread starvation in Yemen, with the death toll due to starvation expected to exceed deaths caused by war, cholera and COVID-19.  Sahel and West Africa  Described by Oxfam as the \\"fastest-growing\\" hunger crisis, and an \\"extreme hunger\\" hotspot, the West African Sahel has 13.4 million people in need of immediate food assistance. The pandemic has exacerbated food insecurity concerns caused by the insurgency in the Maghreb and Sahel as well as extreme weather patterns. On 23 July 2020, the African Development Bank (ADB), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the G5 Sahel signed an agreement in Geneva, Abidjan and Nouakchott. Under the pact, five countries of the Sahel region, Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger, were to receive $20 million to strengthen the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  South Asia  Afghanistan = Afghanistan has been highlighted by Oxfam as an \\"extreme hunger\\" hotspot. Between January and May 2020, 84,600 Afghans fled their homes as a result of armed conflict in the area, with these internally displaced persons at high risk of food insecurity. Alongside this, the effect of the pandemic on neighbouring countries has resulted in Afghan migrants returning home, with 300,000 undocumented migrants estimated to have crossed the border from Iran, where many have become jobless. These migrants are also at-risk and have poor food security. The pandemic has also had an effect on logistics and aid supply that would otherwise normally be present. = Bangladesh = Pre-pandemic, Bangladesh was considered a country with poor food security, with 40 million people considered food insecure and 11 million people acutely hungry. In addition to this, the World Food Programme has provided aid 880,000 Rohingya people fleeing from the Rohingya genocide ongoing in Myanmar, with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasini estimating that at least 1.1 million refugees have fled into Bangladesh. Many of these refugees rely on aid for food, water, education and shelter which have been put at risk by the coronavirus pandemic and locust outbreaks, in a nation already reliant on outside aid for its non-migrant population. Malnutrition, sanitation and access to clean drinking water are problems in many of these camps. Specifically, the United Nations in its Global Report on Food Crises singled out Cox's Bazar where two state-run refugee camps ‚Äì the Kutupalong refugee camp and the Nayapara refugee camp ‚Äì are located. = India = Kolkata slum area in May 2020 India has been identified as an \\"emerging epicentre\\" of hunger by Oxfam. Around 90 million children who would normally receive school meals are no longer able to do so following the education shutdown across India. It has become a logistical challenge to deliver food, despite the fact that in 2019 India had 77.72 million tonnes in surplus grain stocks. T. M. Thomas Isaac, finance minister of Kerala stated that \\"an absolute shortage\\" of essential goods may arise. The informal sector represents 81% of labour in India, with many of these informal workers becoming jobless as a result of lockdown. This has left many unable to pay for food to feed their families. In response, the Indian government has set up \\"relief camps\\" to provide shelter and food to informal and migrant workers. However, many of these became overwhelmed with the large numbers of people requiring food and shelter. Access to slums to deliver essential services and aid has also been hampered by requirements for social distancing.  Industry response  The July 2020 Oxfam report on coronavirus famines calculated that between January and July 2020, the course of the coronavirus pandemic spreading, the eight largest food companies (The Coca-Cola Company, Danone, General Mills, Kellogg's, Mondelez, Nestl√©, PepsiCo and Unilever) gave a total of US$18 billion to shareholders in dividends, 10 times the size of the United Nations estimate for aid required to alleviate food insecurity in famine-stricken areas. Several of these companies, including Nestl√© and PepsiCo wrote with the UN and several farmers' unions to the G20 for support in food distribution and food supply to low income nations.  International response = Supranational  *: The Union issued a declaration, describing \\"deep concern\\" in the continent, urging member states to prioritise farmers and food production as essential services and called upon \\"UN agencies, multilateral development banks, donor countries and other partners to consider the emergency as urgent and step up and provide financial and other resources to help countries that do not have the resources to adequately respond to this crisis\\". * : The EU supported the release of the Global Report on Food Crises by the UN, and said it was \\"working to address the root causes of extreme hunger\\" as part of an \\"international alliance\\". * : Dominique Burgeon, director of the Food and Agriculture Organization called for increased support for poorer and high-risk nations, stating \\"This is a matter of international solidarity, and humanity, but also a matter of global security... The world community needs to come together. We can avoid food shortages if we are able to support countries across the globe.\\"  National  * : Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced a ¬£119 million fund to tackle coronavirus and famine, stating \\"coronavirus and famine threaten millions in some of the world's poorest countries, and give rise to direct problems that affect the UK, including terrorism and migration flows.\\"  See also  * COVID-19 pandemic in Africa * COVID-19 pandemic in Asia * COVID-19 pandemic in South America * Famine scales * Globalisation and disease  References  Category:Famines Category:2019 natural disasters Category:2020 natural disasters Category:COVID-19 pandemic ","title":"Famines related to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"id":"64327113","text":"The 1935 Fordham Rams football team was an American football team that represented Fordham University as an independent during the 1935 college football season.

Part of Bushiroad's BanG Dream! music franchise, it was released in Japan on March 16, 2017. Overseas launches took place in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan on October 19, 2017, in Korea on February 6, 2018, worldwide in English on April 9, 2018, and mainland China on May 30, 2019. While Bushiroad serves as the publisher for the Japanese- and English-language servers, the traditional Chinese game (Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan) was published by Mobimon Inc., while bilibili and Kakao Games oversee the mainland Chinese and Korean versions, respectively. The game has enjoyed success in Japan and worldwide, and is credited with helping the franchise grow in popularity. A spin-off anime series based on the game titled BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! ‚òÜ Pico began airing in 2018. Plot The game's setting mainly follows the BanG Dream! universe after the anime's first season. Girls Band Party! consists of the main story, band stories, and event stories, each of which are split into seasons. In the main story's first season, the player character is a self-named worker at the live house CiRCLE who is tasked by fellow staff member Marina Tsukishima with recruiting groups for the Girls Band Party event. Poppin'Party, the franchise's main band, assists the player in their scouting, during which they enlist the groups Roselia, Afterglow, PastelÔºäPalettes, and Hello, Happy World!. The second season focuses on CiRCLE's plans to host a second Girls Band Party. Band stories focus on the individual bands and their backstories. Poppin'Party has three such stories: the first, \\"Poppin'Party is Born!\\", is a retelling of their formation from the anime's first season; the second, \\"Colorful, Poppin' Candy\\", details the band's efforts to save the downtown festival; \\"Double Rainbow\\" centers on an argument between the five when keyboardist Arisa Ichigaya finds herself compounded by her studies and commitment to the band. Afterglow's first two band stories \\"Afterglow, The Same As Always\\" and \\"Tied to the Skies\\" follow vocalist Ran Mitake's growth, including rebelling against her disapproving father in the former and her relationship with her bandmates as she progresses as a person in the latter, while the third \\"One of Us\\" tells of the band's efforts to participate in a music event. PastelÔºäPalettes' disastrous debut concert and attempts to change their reputation are covered in \\"PastelÔºäPalettes, The Beginning\\", while \\"Luminous Once More\\" discusses the members' dreams and goals. Roselia's creation is detailed in their first story \\"Bloom of the Blue Rose\\", while \\"Neo-Aspect\\" follows their efforts to rediscover their pride after a falling-out. Hello, Happy World!'s two stories \\"Smiles To The World! Hello, Happy Union!\\" and \\"I Need You!\\" focus on their plans to cheer up an injured friend of the band and restoring an old amusement park, respectively. Morfonica and Raise A Suilen's band stories discuss their formations, the latter of which is a retelling of BanG Dream! 3rd Season. Events, in which players compete with one another for the highest total score during a given time period, are complemented by stories. Examples of event stories include \\"Sakura*Blooming Party!\\", where the first-year students convene for a sakura viewing party, and \\"A Song Unfinished\\", where Roselia's Yukina Minato struggles to perform a song her father had written. Gameplay Gameplay in Multi Live mode. The top left bar contains the cumulative score of the multiplayer team, while skill activation is denoted with cut-ins of the respective character. Girls Band Party! gameplay consists of tapping notes as they slide toward the bottom to the rhythm of a chosen song; such notes exist as taps, drag notes that players must hold, flick notes, and special yellow notes that activate character skills and lines mid-performance. Players are given 1,000 health points to clear a song, but one can adjust song speed, difficulty, and note size to their liking. In lieu of a energy system that is prevalent in most free-to-play games, Girls Band Party! utilizes Live Boosts that increases rewards for completing a song, and players can continue playing even when they run out of boosts. Songs are generally one minute and 30 seconds in length, though full-length tracks for some tracks are available. In 2019, the game introduced a music video feature that replaces the in-game background with the openings to the anime's second season; additional videos from the movie BanG Dream! Film Live were added later that year. Some songs were created by the winning bands in the game's General Election, a series of voting contests based on a certain topic. For example, the second election mixed the bands' members to form different units; the winning group (High School Part Time Workers) resulted in the song \\"Hitori Janain Dakara\\", which would be used as an insert song in the anime's second season. Besides original songs, cover versions of popular music by the five bands are also playable. Certain covers were spawned from collaborations between BanG Dream! and other franchises like Vocaloid, the video game series Persona, and the anime Is the Order a Rabbit?, Re:Zero ‚àí Starting Life in Another World, and A Certain Scientific Railgun T. The addition of cover songs was inspired by their positive reception during BanG Dream! first live concerts, with franchise creator Takaaki Kidani comparing them to the use of mainstream series in Bushiroad's Wei√ü Schwarz card game as \\"drops in momentum\\" are canceled out by \\"the addition of popular titles.\\" The international versions also have region- exclusive tracks: in 2018, the Korean server partnered with K-pop group GFriend to include their songs \\"Me Gustas Tu\\" and \\"Time for the Moon Night\\", while the English game featured Pinkfong's \\"Baby Shark\\" and daniwellP's \\"Nyan Cat\\" for a limited time. Players gain experience points (EXP) by clearing songs and listening to overworld conversations between characters. Such talks are fully voiced with 2.5D movement via Live2D technology, and their conversations are depicted in a visual novel-style presentation. Further dialogues can be attain by improving cards and attaining more EXP. EXP also improves a band's rank, which unlocks additional chapters in band stories. Cards, which use a star ranking system to determine rarity (four stars being the rarest), are acquired via the gacha system, a luck-based mechanic in which players spend the in-game currency Stars with the hope of winning their desired cards. Although Girls Band Party! is a free-to-play game, players can spend real-life money to acquire more stars. The game's multiplayer, known as Multi Live, is a cooperative mode in which five players try to record a high cumulative score. During performances, the team can earn more points when they maximize a \\"Fever Chance\\" combo bar and enter \\"Fever\\" mode. ComicsVerse writer Hayden Moseley described Multi Lives as \\"revolutionary\\" since multiplayer modes in other Japanese mobile rhythm games are typically player versus player. During the game's anniversaries in March, new contents are added and the main story is updated. The second anniversary in 2019 saw the introduction of an overworld lounge that features new character interactions and animations. The following year, Raise A Suilen and Morfonica were added as playable bands, while new gameplay mechanics included Live2D animation during lives and a \\"rehearsal\\" mode that allows players to practice songs without fearing health depletion. Development BanG Dream! was formed in 2014 by Bushiroad head Takaaki Kidani, whose company had enjoyed success with the rhythm game Love Live! School Idol Festival. Bushiroad reached out to CyberAgent's Craft Egg, who agreed to create a BanG Dream! game after expressing interest in the franchise's premise of voice actresses capable of playing their own instruments. After initially considering a simulation or puzzle game, Craft Egg CEO Shuichi Morikawa opted to frame it as a music game. To differentiate Girls Band Party! from competing titles in the genre, Craft Egg included cover songs, which was inspired by Poppin'Party's usage of such music in its live concerts, and made it free to play. K≈ç Nakamura, who created the story for BanG Dream! and the lyrics for Poppin'Party's original songs, had no involvement in writing the game's storyline. Development of the game was announced on September 15, 2016 at Tokyo Game Show with a release planned in spring 2017; in addition to the pre-existing Poppin'Party, Roselia's members debuted at the event. The other vocalists Ayane Sakura (Afterglow's Ran), Ami Maeshima (PastelÔºäPalettes' Aya Maruyama), and Miku It≈ç (Hello, Happy World!'s Kokoro Tsurumaki) were officially confirmed during a presentation on December 7 at Sunshine City, Tokyo, while Afterglow's voice actresses revealed their involvement with the project on Twitter during the month. The remaining cast members were revealed during a show at EX Theater Roppongi to promote the game on February 24, 2017. In-game dialogue is recorded in groups, such as between band members, to allow for a natural atmosphere in conversations. Pre- registration opened on January 1, 2017; Kidani heavily encouraged others to pre-register when the anime, which began airing that month, received mediocre reviews. By the game's launch in March, over 560,000 players had completed the process. Closed beta testing for the game launched on February 17. Release and marketing Lawson in Chongqing in 2019 The game was first released in Japan on March 16, 2017.

In 2019, Girls Band Party! partnered with SCRAP Co. to organize \\"Find the Random Star!\\", an escape room-like game in which participants search for Kasumi Toyama's lost guitar by solving riddles located throughout the city. The event ran from December 4, 2019 to February 29, 2020 in Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka. BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! ‚òÜ Pico, a chibi anime series, premiered on July 5, 2018, while a sequel BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! ‚òÜ Pico ~Ohmori~ began on May 7, 2020. Bushiroad and Kadokawa Corporation also released an anthology series manga called BanG Dream! Garupa ‚òÜ Pico Comic Anthology, which features comics from 17 artists, on March 14, 2019. Various promotional events have been held to support the game. On January 13‚Äì14, 2018, the franchise's five bands participated in the Garupa Live and Garupa Party! at Tokyo Big Sight, which included a tournament and performances. In 2019 and 2020, the game was a title sponsor for New Japan Pro-Wrestling's Wrestle Kingdom 13 and 14; Kenny Omega, then a wrestler for Bushiroad-owned NJPW, also starred in a commercial for the game. In May 2018, Girls Band Party! partnered with Sega's arcade rhythm game Ongeki to include the vocalists as playable characters and opponents in the latter; songs from BanG Dream! are also available. A collaboration with fellow smartphone game Lost Decade took place in August 2020 in which Roselia's voice actresses appeared in Lost Decade in-game radio show and the band's characters became attainable. Reception BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! has garnered positive reviews, with ComicsVerse's Jessica Liong describing it as \\"arguably the most popular\\" animated aspect of the franchise. Speaking with Real Sound in 2018, Kidani remarked \\"everything just went through the roof\\" after the game's release, noting its \\"level of polish\\" was among the factors that helped the franchise gain popularity. In a 2018 review for ComicsVerse, Moseley noted the game grants \\"too much freedom\\" for players, which is beneficial for those experienced with rhythm games but the contrary for newcomers. Despite this, he suggested much of its appeal comes from the interactions between characters, comparing it to \\"watching a playable anime.\\" He also praised GBP for its \\"complex\\" but \\"rewarding and incredibly fun\\" gameplay, concluding that \\"the music and the girls are completely worth exploring.\\" In Japan, the game surpassed four million downloads in its first six months following release; by November 2019, it had over 11 million Japanese players. It grossed () between 2017 and 2018, including in 2017 and in 2018. In 2018, the game was the 15th most successful mobile game and the second-most successful rhythm game in Japan in terms of revenue, only behind The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls: Starlight Stage. The game's worldwide English server exceeded one million downloads in two months, followed by reaching ten million in August 2018. GBP has received awards in Japan like the App Store's \\"Top Game Ranking\\" and Google Play's \\"Grand Prize for Players' Choice Game and Attractive Game\\" in 2017.

Morgan opted to play for the Louisville Cardinals over offers from the Kentucky Wildcats and his hometown Dayton Flyers. He scored 1,105 points in four seasons played with the Cardinals. Morgan was selected by the Syracuse Nationals as the 15th overall pick in the 1957 NBA draft but opted to not sign with the team after they offered him a $5,000 contract. He was a social studies teacher and basketball coach at Stebbins High School in Riverside, Ohio, for nine seasons.

Guru Ram Rai settled here with his followers in the mid-17th century, after he was banished by the Sikh orthodoxy for mistranslating scripture in front of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, so as to not cause offence. It is believed the city, Dehradun, gets its name from the religious camp established by him: a \\"dera\\", or camp, in the \\"doon\\" valley. The building is historically and architecturally significant, as it derives many of its architectural motifs, like minarets, domes and gardens, from Islamic architecture. While Sikh architecture, in general, drew inspiration from Mughal styles, the Darbar Sahib was unique in that it relied more heavily on elements that give it the appearance of a mosque than a conventional gurudwara. This was unusual in the 17th-18th centuries, as at the time Sikhs were generally in conflict with the Muslim rulers of India. The Islamic influence was the result of a cordial relationship between Guru Ram Rai and the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, who provided lands and funds for the site.: \\"At that time Fateh Shah was reigning in Garhwal. The Emperor Aurangzeb directed him to grant some villages to the Guru in the Doon to provide for his sect and the service at the Dehra.\\" History The temple site was founded by Guru Ram Rai in the mid-17th century after he was banished by the orthodox Sikh sect for mistranslating a word in the Adi Granth in front of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. He replaced the word \\"Mussalman\\" with \\"faithless\\" to prevent causing offence. The settlement is believed to have given Dehradun its name: a \\"dera\\", or camp, in the \\"Doon\\" valley. The central complex of the temple was completed in 1699, twelve years after Guru Ram Rai's death, and the complete structural work was finished between 1703 and 1706; embellishment and painting work is thought to have continued long after the structural completion. Mata Panjab Kaur, Guru Ram Rai's wife, oversaw the construction work and managed the affairs of the Darbar till her death in 1741/42. Architecture Unusually for a Sikh place of worship, Indo-Islamic architecture defines the main Darbar structure, which is surrounded by a miniature Mughal-style garden. The central mausoleum was inspired by the Tomb of Jahangir.Dehra Town The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 11, p. 221-223 Wall paintings The buildings in the complex were once lavishly decorated with Mughal-style wall paintings, which were specimens of rare wall paintings found in Uttarakhand. The paintings have either been lost to successive re-paintings or re-marblings or are in poor shape and in need of preservation. Some paintings date back to the 17th century and are over 300 years old. Between 2004 and 2014, Archaeological Survey of India carried out restoration work on the historic murals. Jhanda Mela The new flag being erected during the Jhanda Mela in the temple precincts. Jhanda Mela, literally \\"flag fair\\", is an annual religious fair that takes place in the temple precincts; it is believed to have been held since 1676. The fair marks the arrival of Guru Ram Rai at the site, and starts five days after the festival of Holi and continues till Rama Navami. The symbolic flag is a hundred-feet tall tree trunk wrapped in layers of clothing. During the fair, devotees, who come from across India and abroad, gather in large numbers and replace the previous year's flag in a religious ceremony.

At the end of October 1943, the division moved to northern France to the Arras-Doullens area and at the beginning of December 1943 to the Eastern Front. Here it took up defensive positions as part of the 3rd Panzer Army in the area of Vitebsk. In February it was sent to the North to fight in the Battle of Narva.

Following the decision to reinforce the New Guinea area, in November and December 1942, the brigade was dispersed, with one regiment (the 141st) along with the brigade headquarters and half its supporting elements moving to Rabaul to become part of the 18th Army; meanwhile other elements of the brigade were sent to other locations. Its first commander was Major General Naka Akira. Under Major General Iwao Matsuda, the brigade's main element‚Äîthe 141st Infantry Regiment‚Äîlater took part in the Battle of Cape Gloucester, during the New Britain campaign, in late 1943 before withdrawing towards Rabaul. According to Gordon Rottman, around this time the brigade was \\"dissolved\\" and its units re- assigned. Late in the war, the brigade was re-raised as an independent mixed brigade for home defense and was assigned to the Eastern District Army in 1944‚Äì1945; in the final stages of the war there were plans to raise the 321st Division drawing manpower from the 65th, which was based in the Izu Islands. Structure In its configuration as an independent mixed brigade, the 65th consisted of the following units: * 27th Independent Mixed Regiment * 1st Special Garrison Battalion * 246th Independent Motor Transport Company * 105th Special Sea Duty Company * 65th Independent Mixed Brigade Field Hospital NotesReferences  * * Category:Independent Mixed Brigades (Imperial Japanese Army) Category:Military units and formations established in 1941 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1945 Category:1941 establishments in Japan Category:1943 disestablishments in Japan ","title":"65th Independent Mixed Brigade (Imperial Japanese Army)"},{"id":"64327730","text":"Laal Kothi Paak Darbaar Sharif (‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶≤ ‡¶ï‡ßÅ‡¶†‡¶ø ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶ï ‡¶¶‡¶∞‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶∂‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶´) is a Sufi shrine constructed over the grave of Khwaja Saifuddin Nakshbandi Mujaddidi(Inyatpuri).

The shopping center reopened in May 2008.  Overview  Park Lane by CMP is located directly adjacent to Calligraphy Greenway, a major linear park. The shopping center has 15 floors above ground and 2 below, out of which floors 4 to 11 are parking spaces. Eslite Bookstore occupies the entire 3rd floor along with a store on the 2nd floor dedicated to stationery. The B1 floor is dedicated to dining. One of the defining features of the building is its large green walls present in both the interior and exterior of the building.

The case concerned defendant Mark Towle who built and sold replicas of Batmobile in his garage named 'Garage Gotham'. DC Comics initially filed a lawsuit, in May 2011, in the federal district court alleging causes of action for copyright infringement, trademark infringement and unfair competition arising out of Mark's manufacture and sale of replicas. The plaintiffs, DC Comics, claimed the infringement of their copyright as the replicas sold by Mark were similar to the ones that appeared in 1966 television show Batman and the 1989 film Batman. The issue discussed by the court was \\"whether a character in a comic book, television program or motion picture is entitled to copyright protection\\". The ninth circuit followed the precedents and came up with a three-part test to determine the protection given to such characters.DC Comics v Mark Towle, 802 F.3d 1012 (9th Cir. 2015) The three-part test to determine the copyright protection for a comic character is as follows: # \\"The character must generally have physical as well as conceptual qualities. # The character must be sufficiently delineated to be recognizable as the same character whenever it appears. It must display consistent, identifiable character traits and attributes, although the character need not have a consistent appearance. # The character must be especially distinctive and contain some unique elements of expression. It cannot be a stock character like a magician in standard magician garb.\\" The court applied this test on Batmobile to conclude that the character is the property of DC Comics and is entitled to copyright protection. The defendant, thus, had infringed upon the plaintiff's copyright. While concluding so, the ninth circuit court affirmed the judgement of the federal district court.  Background = Plaintiffs  DC comics is an American comic book publisher and owner of the comic books featuring the story of Batman. It is also one of the oldest and largest American comic book companies.DC Comics, available at: www.dccomics.com. The character in question, the Batmobile, is a fictional, high-tech automobile which is the primary mode of transportation for Batman. It possesses Bat like external features and is equipped with futuristic weaponry and crime fighting technology. Since the creation of the character it has appeared multiple times in various comic books, television series or motion pictures. As pointed out by the court, two depictions of the Batmobile are relevant for the case: 1966 television series starring Adam West, and the 1989 motion picture starring Michael Keaton.  Defendant  Mark Towle is the owner of 'Gotham Garage' where he produced replicas of the aforementioned batmobile versions. The court notes that Mark concedes the fact that the replicas copy the designs of such versions, though they do no copy every feature. Various car collectors were buying these replicas for a price worth $90,000 approximately. Before a lawsuit was filed by DC Comics, Mark had advertised these replicas as the \\"batmobile\\" and used the domain name batmobilereplicas.com. Mark himself admitted that he was not authorized by the plaintiffs to manufacture such replicas. he also sells kits which the customers can use to modify their cars to look like Batmobile. Hence, a lawsuit was filed by DC Comics in the federal district court claiming infringement of their copyright & trademark protection and causing unfair competition arising out of the replicas being sold in the market.  Federal District Court's ruling  The district court granted, in part, and denied in part DC Comics' motion for summary judgement while denying the cross motion for summary judgement filed by Mark Towle.DC Comics v Towle, 989 F. Supp. 2d 948 (C.D. Cal. 2013) The rulings of the district court are as follows: # The Batmobile was a character entitled to copyright protection‚Äîit is known by one consistent name which identifies it as Batman's personal vehicle. Further, several physical traits of the Batmobile have remained consistent over time and has always been depicted as \\"swift, cunning, strong, and elusive\\". # DC Comics was the owner of the merchandising rights of Batman and hence, had maintained the copyright protection in the Batmobile. # Mark Towle had infringed DC's copyright because he made replicas of the Batmobile as it appeared in the 1966 television series and 1989 motion pictures. Further, the court also held that Mark had acted in bad faith and had intentionally copied DC's trademark so as to associate his products with the productions.  Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit's reasoning  To determine the copyrightability of the Batmobile, the court applied the aforementioned framework of the three- part test and affirmed the findings of the district court. The analysis of the court is as follows: # The court notes that the Batmobile is not simply a literary character but rather one which has \\"physical as well as conceptual qualities\\". It has appeared graphically in comic books and as a 3-dimensional figure in motion pictures and television series. # As the Batmobile has maintained its \\"physical and conceptual qualities\\" since its first appearance, it can be concluded that it is \\"sufficiently delineated\\" to be recognizable as the same character wherever it appears.Halicki Films, LLC v. Sanderson Sales & Mktg., 547 F.3d 1213, 1224 (9th Cir. 2008) Its colour, bat-themed shape and crime fighting technology has remained consistent throughout various appearances. Like in the comic books, the batmobile as portrayed in the 1966 television series and 1989 motion pictures share similar attributes and character traits even though the appearance seems to be different. # The third prong of the test requires the character to be especially distinctive and contain some unique elements of expression. The batmobile has been portrayed consistently as Batman's side-kick with unique character traits and attributes. It is also known by its highly recognizable name throughout the comic books, television series or motion pictures. Hence the court is satisfied that the third prong of the test is met as the Batmobile is not merely a stock character. After being satisfied that the character in question is copyrightable by DC Comics, the court analysed whether replicas manufactures by Mark Towle infringed DC's copyright protection. Mark does not contest the fact that he manufactured 'replicas' of Batmobile as they appeared in the aforementioned series and motion pictures. The court negates the main argument of the defendant that \\"DC Comics does not own the copyright interest in the Batmobile\\"; DC transferred its right to produce derivative works under the 1965 agreement with American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and later under the 1979 agreement with Batman Productions, Inc. (BPI). However, while doing so, it did not transfer the ownership of the character. Hence, the copyright protection still lies with DC comics. Lastly, as the copying of the character was admitted by Mark, the court did not apply the \\"substantial similarity\\" test to determine infringement.  Conclusion  The United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit concluded that DC comics owns the copyright to the 'Batmobile' character as it appeared in 1966 television series and the 1989 motion pictures. Further, that Mark had infringed this copyright by manufacturing replicas of the character. Thus by concluding so, the ninth circuit affirmed the decision of the federal district court. This ruling of the ninth circuit expands the application of copyright law by prescribing requirements for comic-book characters to be protected. The three-part test to determine this protection seems to be efficient enough to leave stock characters and characters with inadequate unique expressions in the public domain to be used as derivative works.

The aim of CASA is to promote the study and appreciation of classical antiquity. The majority of its membership consists of academic staff and students, but membership is open to anyone who subscribes to this goal. The Association organises a national conference at its biennial meeting, and national branches organise more frequent regional meetings. The Association sponsors various prizes and awards, and promotes several outreach initiatives.  History  The inaugural meeting of the Association was held on the 22nd of June 1908 in Cape Town with the presidential address given by Professor W. Ritchie at the South African College (now the University of Cape Town). The organisation was envisioned as a national association two years before the Union of South Africa came into being in 1910. The 1908 Association, though short-lived, was the precursor to the later association founded at Cape Town in 1927 by the Hon. J. H. Hofmeyr, Professors C. S. Edgar, W. Rollo, A. Petrie, and T. J. Haarhoff, with Marie V. Williams as Honorary Secretary. The 1927 Association enjoyed moderate success, but was beset with practical difficulties. After a period of decline and a brief revival in 1952, the Classical Association of South Africa was formally re-constituted in 1956. A national conference was held at Pretoria where the Association as it exists today was founded, with Professors A. Petrie and T. J. Haarhoff as its Honorary Presidents. In 1957 the biennial national conference was established, and in 1958 the first volume of Acta Classica was published. Early reports on the history of CASA are published in Acta Classica.

Early life Maria da Concei√ß√£o Mart√≠nez (Martins) de Sousa Bastos was born on 30 May 1875, in the municipality of Alenquer in the Lisbon District of Portugal. She was the third daughter of a couple of Spanish actors from a travelling company who were temporarily in Portugal. After being abandoned by her husband, her mother and her three daughters went to Lisbon, where the mother worked as a dressmaker by day and as a chorus girl at night. Career Palmira Bastos's debut as an actress took place on 18 July 1890 at the Teatro da Rua dos Condes, when she received an ovation for her performance. She continued to perform there for several years, in 1893 having her first starring role and making the first of eleven tours to Brazil. In 1894 she moved to the Teatro da Trindade, which was managed by the dramaturge and impresario, Ant√≥nio de Sousa Bastos, who had given her her first role in 1890. She married Sousa Bastos, 30 years her elder, in 1894 and they had two daughters. Between 1900 and 1903 she performed at Teatro Avenida and in April 1904, she made her debut at the D. Maria II National Theatre in Lisbon. In the seasons from 1905 to 1907, as well as in the season of 1909/10, she was part of the cast of the Teatro Dona Am√©lia. Her dedication to serious or legitimate theatre caused displeasure among the admirers of her performance in lighter works. To their satisfaction Palmira then joined a company performing Viennese operas, at the Teatro da Trindade until 1913. Her husband died in 1911 and in 1917 she married Ant√≥nio Maria Monteiro de Sousa de Almeida Cruz, who was both an actor and a tenor. The marriage did not last long. Palmira Bastos made only one film, the silent movie called O Destino (The Destiny), in 1922, with the French Director George Pallu. The years that followed involved almost constant collaboration with the Rey Cola√ßo-Robles Monteiro theatre company. It was during this period that Bastos saw her status as first lady of the Portuguese theatre consolidated. From 1931 to 1936 she was a regular at the National Theatre, to which the Rey Cola√ßo-Robles Monteiro company had moved. After several years away from popular theatre, she made a brief (and final) return to the genre in plays at the Teatro Avenida and, in 1937, at the Teatro Variedades. She then returned to the Rey Cola√ßo-Robles Monteiro Company at the National Theatre, which she only left when she retired from the stage in 1966.

Background On 30 March 1972 the PAVN launched the Easter Offensive against South Vietnam. In Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province by early April South Vietnamese forces succeeded in halting the PAVN advance at ƒê√¥ng H√†. By 28 April the PAVN had surrounded Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã and begun shelling the city and the only escape route was along Highway 1 with almost the entire population of 20,000 fleeing the city. Attack South Vietnamese civilians began fleeing Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã on foot and on any available vehicles forming columns up to long. At the same time PAVN armored and infantry units from the 324th Division moved south of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã on either side of Highway 1 periodically firing on the Highway. The largest group of refugees assembled in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã for evacuation early on 29 April, although three quarters of the people in the convoy were civilians, 95 percent of the vehicles in the column were military; the majority were two and one-half ton trucks plus a considerable number of flatbeds, tankers, small trucks, jeeps and 15 ambulances. The convoy had gone approximately south on Highway 1, to the vicinity of H·∫£i LƒÉng District. At this point, the convoy came under attack by PAVN direct and indirect fire. Lead vehicles were stopped immediately and mass confusion ensued. The overstretched Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 3rd Division had failed to organise flank security for the convoy allowing the PAVN to attack, inflicting a physical and psychological blow on the South Vietnamese civilians and military. On 1 May the 3rd Division commander gave the order to abandon Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã and all remaining ARVN forces and civilians abandoned the city and fled south along Highway 1 under fire from the PAVN. Burning trucks, armored vehicles, civilian buses and cars jammed the Highway and forced all traffic off the road in a scene that the South Vietnamese press dubbed the \\"Highway of Horror\\". A PAVN corporal with a mortar unit reported, \\"The people were moving on bicycles, motorbikes and buses... No one was able to escape.\\" A solid wall of military and civilian rolling stock of every description, bumper-to-bumper and three vehicles abreast; remained on the road. Personal effects, individual equipment and bodies were piled in the vehicles and lay strewn alongside, and to the east, where individuals had attempted to flee to safety. The Washington Post reported on 2 May that a PAVN regimental command post south of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã was surrounded by captured refugees being used as human shields against Allied attacks. The official PAVN history states that \\"Accurate fire from our long- range artillery positions created added terror among the enemy troops...Route 1 from Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã to northern Thua Thien province became a \\"highway of death\\" for the enemy.\\" Aftermath During the Second Battle of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã, South Vietnamese forces advanced from their positions on the My Chanh Line northwest of Hu·∫ø and succeeded in recapturing most of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province. With the area under South Vietnamese control, South Vietnamese and international reporters were able to access the area in early July and see the destruction that had taken place two months previously. Estimates vary of the total number of civilians killed, South Vietnamese journalists D∆∞∆°ng Ph·ª•c and V≈© Thanh Th·ªßy estimated 5,000 killed, while Red Cross officials placed the death toll at 2,000, including women, children and elderly and sick evacuees from Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã hospitals.

The festival is also a celebration of the anniversary the city of Latacunga's independence.  Origin  The festival of Mama Negra has origins in indigenous, Spanish and African cultures. Two distinct themes are seen in the festival: that of the pre-Columbian era, from which stemmed the indigenous folklore characters, and that of colonialism, which brought Spanish and African cultural influences to Latacunga. Gradually created by many generations, the result presents characteristics of a traditional ceremony adjusted to incorporate aspects of Christian religious ceremonies introduced by the Spanish Conquest.El Comercio In 1742, the Virgen de la Merced allegedly stopped the eruption of Cotopaxi volcano, and was proclaimed \\"Advocate and Patron of the Volcano\\" by the residents of Latacunga, who pledged to celebrate an annual fiesta in her honor.  Celebration  The Mama Negra festival takes place at the end of September, when the Catholic Church commemorates the Virgen de la Merced, and for a second time in November, when Latacunga celebrates the anniversary of its independence. Features of the celebration include bands of musicians, dancing, and a parade of familiar characters representing folklore, military and religious figures.

Description Phebalium lowanense is a slender shrub that typically grows to a height of and is more or less covered with silvery or rust-coloured scales. The leaves are linear, long and about wide but with the edges strongly rolled under, so that they appear cylindrical. The upper surface of the leaves is glabrous and slightly scaly, and the lower surface is covered with silvery scales. The flowers are yellow and arranged in umbels on the ends of branchlets with up to six flowers, each flower on a thick pedicel long. The sepals are long and joined for about half their length, and densely covered with silvery scales and star-shaped hairs. The petals are egg-shaped, about long and wide, covered with silvery and rust-coloured scales on the back. Flowering occurs August to September. Taxonomy and naming Phebalium lowanense was first formally described in 1957 by James Hamlyn Willis in The Victorian Naturalist from specimens he collected near the border between South Australia and Victoria in 1948.

Operating since 1982, it produces 54 mm cast lead figurines which are painted by hand. The miniatures depict mostly soldiers from the British Army in Napoleonic times through to World War II, as well as MƒÅori and Victorian civilians.  Origin  Imperial Productions shop, McMaster Street, Greytown Imperial Productions was founded by David Cowe in 1982. Born in Lower Hutt, Cowe was the youngest of three boys, and received their hand-me-down pre-WWII lead toy soldiers to play with which sparked an interest in model making and military history. He later completed a diploma in graphic design and moved to London in the 1960s to attend Saint Martin's School of Art. On his return to New Zealand, he worked as a freelance illustrator and started a graphic design business as well as teaching at the Wellington School of Design. While living in Greytown with his family of three daughters, he noticed toy soldiers advertised in a UK magazine and decided to try making his own. Cowe began casting soldiers commercially in 1982. In 1987 he opened a shop and showroom in a tiny building on McMaster Street, just off Greytown's main street, which was originally the Greytown bootmaker's shop. Sales were initially by telephone and mail, but are now largely online and international.  The soldiers  A display case of 54 mm toy soldiers inside Imperial Productions Imperial Productions soldiers are cast in solid lead at 54 mm (2.25 inches) or 1:32 scale, the traditional \\"normal size\\" for the toy soldiers first used by W.

A 70% lead, 30% tin alloy is melted at 300‚ÑÉ and cast in the mould, and the resulting figure is used to make a rubber mould for mass production. The company produced more than 1000 hand-cast and hand- painted figurines a year; since 1998 Cowe's daughter Lisa Cowe-Kirk has painted the soldiers in traditional gloss enamel colours. The soldiers generally range from Napoleonic to World War II, and include British military forces such as the 1st Foot Guards, Coldstream Guards from the Crimean War, and Camel Corps, dervishes, and Winston Churchill from the 1898 Battle of Omdurman. New Zealand figurines include MƒÅori in traditional dress, the New Zealand Girls' Khaki Brigade, and Armed Constabulary from 1870. There are also Victorian civilian figurines including women, children, and domestic animals.

It was produced by Wildbear Entertainment in collaboration with the ABC, which broadcast the show in 2020. The show predominantly draws on footage from ABC news and current affairs shows, interspersed with commentary from former leaders, academics and journalists including Melina Abdullah, Christiane Amanpour, Helen Clark, Gareth Evans, Niall Ferguson, Thomas Friedman, John Howard, Yascha Mounk and Malala Yousafzai. In each episode, Bath describes various interrelated events which occurred between the end of the Cold War, an optimistic period when many believed Western values and the free market had triumphed, and the current period marked by conflict and illiberalism. Writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, Ben Pobjie described the series as a fine example of a deep-dive historical perspective, which although did not reveal much particularly new, nevertheless showed how unrecognisable the immediate post-Cold War era is to the current day. Inside Storys Jane R. Goodall criticised the script and Chris Bath's leaden delivery, which often lacked sufficiently deep perspective and failed to marshal structural and thematic clarity. Episodes Age of Conflict (broadcast 26 May 2020) The collapse of the Soviet bloc leads to the Yugoslav Wars. The West intervenes in Afghanistan and Iraq in response to the 9/11 attacks. However what ensues is terrorism, the Syrian Civil War and the emergence of insurgencies including ISIS and Boko Haram. NATO's eastwards expansion prompts a revanchist Russia to attack Ukraine and Estonia. Cyberwarfare becomes a potent weapon. Global Shapers (broadcast 2 June 2020) Profiles influential post-Cold War leaders and their relationships with the peoples they led: Mikhail Gorbachev, Nelson Mandela, Vladimir Putin, Saddam Hussein, Aung San Suu Kyi, Barack Obama, Angela Merkel, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. The Fight for our Rights (broadcast 9 June 2020) The hopes that personal and political rights would flourish after the end of the Cold War do not materialise. Instead ethnic conflicts and atrocities take place in Bosnia and Rwanda, and the international community fails to intervene. Democracy and human rights retreat in Turkey under President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. Saudi Arabia murders journalist Jamal Khashoggi with impunity. A surveillance state emerges in China, and commitments to Hong Kong's political autonomy are not met. The episode also looks at rights for homosexuals in Russia and Ireland, gender equality in Pakistan, the Me Too movement, Black Lives Matter and gun control in the United States. Return of the Wall (broadcast 16 June 2020) Instability, persecution and poverty in Afghanistan, Africa, the Middle East and Central America drive millions to seek a better life in the West. The war in Syria leads to the European migrant crisis. Attitudes in receiving countries harden, especially after Angela Merkel's open door policy and sexual assault incidents in Germany. Immigration becomes a decisive issue in the Brexit referendum and the election of Donald Trump. Globalisation (broadcast 23 June 2020) The end of the Cold War brings about economic growth and poverty alleviation, accelerated by the new technologies and increased foreign capital flows from the West to the East. Market forces rise in China, while India benefits from outsourcing. Financial deregulation in the United States results in the Global Financial Crisis, which has serious global impacts including in Iceland and Greece. Entrenched inequality and lingering unemployment help brings Donald Trump to the White House. China's growth is sustained through developing high tech capabilities, but trade imbalances, intellectual property theft and an increasingly aggressive posture make it a strategic competitor with the United States. In Harm's Way (broadcast 30 June 2020) From 1989 to 2019 the world's population rises from five to nearly eight billion, placing more people at risk of natural disasters. Seismic events in the Indian Ocean, Haiti, Iceland and Japan create carnage and disruption. Climate change contributes to extreme weather events including Hurricane Katrina, bushfires in Australia and rising sea levels in the Pacific. A succession of international summits produces the Rio Declaration, the Kyoto Protocol, the Copenhagen Accord and the Paris Agreement, but they are considered inadequate at addressing climate change.

Jiu zixing is formed in the Ming Dynasty, and is also known as Ky≈´jitai in Japan; it also refers to the characters used in China before the Chinese writing reform and the issuing of 1964 \\"List of Character Forms of Common Chinese characters for Publishing\\". Broadly speaking, jiu zixing also refers to the character forms used in printing Chinese before reformation by national stardardization, e.g. xin zixing () in China, Standard Form of National Characters in Taiwan, and List of Graphemes of Commonly-Used Chinese Characters in Hong Kong; jiu zixing is generally the opposite form of the standards. The representative books that used jiu zixing includes \\"Kangxi Dictionary\\", \\"Zhongwen Da Cidian\\", \\"Dahanhe Cidian\\", \\"Chinese-Korean Dictionary\\", and \\"Zhonghua Da Zidian\\". There are several standards of jiu zixing developed by scholars before, but there is no single enforced standard. Variations of jiu zixing standard can be see in Kangxi Dictionary, Old Chinese printing form, Korean Hanja, some printing forms in Taiwan and MingLiU in Windows 98 and earlier versions; slight differences may occur between different jiu zixing standards. Currently there are also open-sourced communities that developed and maintain modern jiu zixing standards that are based on and/or unify other jiu zixing forms from academic researches.  Origin  During the woodblock printing era, words are usually carved in handwritten form (regular script) as each woodblock is different, making the job tedious per printed book. The development of wooden movable type in Song dynasty has caused the Chinese characters to take on a more rectangular form following the wood texture of the pieces. Vertical strokes are thicken to reduce engraving loss, while a little triangle is added at the end of horizontal stroke and start of vertical stroke to improve the legibility of text even after the pieces are worn out by long-term use. As the character styles start to differ widely from regular script, the calligraphic methods used on regular scripts could not be used on movable type characters and a new distinctive style designated for movable type is born. This style is developed fully in Ming dynasty, which now develops to Ming typefaces.Kinkido Type Laboratory - Home ‚Üí ‚óèÁü•„Çã: Êº¢Â≠óÊõ∏‰Ωì Comparing the style between movable type and woodblock, it can be noticed that movable type characters - which is the basics of jiu zixing today - is different from the random and changing nature of handwritten regular script, and emphasize clear strokes and beautiful, symmetric structure of characters. Movable type characters also emphasize the philology aspects of Chinese characters than regular script.  Characteristics  Compared to regular script form and xin zixing which is based on regular script form, jiu zixing has many differences from xin zixing. The nomenclature for strokes here uses the inherited name.  From outlook  * Breaking of strokes: In components such as \\"†Éä\\", \\"†Ñå\\", \\"°ø®\\", where the connection of compound strokes may be complicated, vertical strokes are extended outward of diagonal stroke, and horizontal stokes extend outward of vertical strokes. ** Stable leg: In components such as \\"Âè£\\", \\"Âõó\\", \\"Âáµ\\", \\"Â±±\\", both side of the character should have the legs extended, i.e. obeying the breaking of \\"†Éä\\" stroke to stabalize the character and prevent tipping from occurring. Xin zixing standards are hard to achieve this stable form. * No prevention of heavy press stroke (ÈÅøÈáçÊç∫): When two or more press (Êç∫Ôºå„áè) appear in a single character, keep both presses instead of changing one of the press to dot (ÁÇπ/ÈªûÔºå‰∏∂). Example: last stroke of \\"È£ü\\", eighth stroke of \\"ÁÑö\\". ** Last press stroke (Êú´Êç∫): Characters that contain components with last stroke as press, such as \\"Êú®\\", \\"Á¶æ\\", \\"Â§ß\\", should not convert the press to a dot when it is unnecessary, for example at the right side or bottom of a character. ** Start of press: Some jiu zixing standards adds extra stroke at the start of press, for example a upward horizontal stroke (ÊåëÔºå„áÄ) before a press (such as \\"‰πÇ\\") or a horizontal stroke (Ê®™Ôºå„áê) before a press (such as \\"ÂÖ•\\", \\"ÂÖ´\\"). *Ê∞µ ¬∑ ÂÜ´: Last stroke is a dot-upward horizontal stroke (ÁÇπÊåëÔºå25px). *': First stroke is a throw-dot stroke (ÊíáÁÇπÔºå„áõ), not a throw-upward horizontal stroke (ÊíáÊäòÔºå„áú). *': The bottom should be a shape of \\"°≠î\\" intimating silk-like coil, not \\"Â∞è\\" or three dots. *‚ªç: Written as dot, dot, horizontal-vertical, upward horizontal‚Äìflat press (Âπ≥Êç∫Ôºå25px), not like regular script of \\"‚ªé\\" or xin zixing \\"‚ªå\\". *ÂÆÄ: First stroke is a wilted dot (or vertical dot, Á´ñÁÇπÔºå25px). *': Last stroke is a horizontal stroke.  From philology  *‰∫†: Some characters in regular script are written with a dot, it is a wilted dot in jiu zixing, such as \\"Á´ã\\", \\"Êñá\\", \\"‰∫¢\\", \\"È´ò\\", \\"‰∏ª\\". Etymological, the first stroke comes from the shape of a person's head or the top of a building. *†Ñû: Some characters in regular script are written with a dot, it is a horizontal stroke in jiu zixing, such as \\"Ëæõ\\", \\"Á´•\\", \\"Èæç\\", \\"Ë®Ä\\", \\"Èü≥\\". Etymological, the first horizontal stroke mostly comes from component \\"Ëæõ\\" or \\"‰áÇ\\", or from the indicating symbol in \\"Ë®Ä\\" (representing the top of \\"Ëàå\\"/tongue). *‰∫º: Not as \\"‰∫Ω\\". Example as . *ÂÖß: Follows \\"ÂÖ•\\", not as \\"‰∫∫\\" (ÂÜÖ). *‚∫¨: Top part follows \\"†Ñû\\" (shape like \\"‰∫å\\"). Not as \\"Á§ª\\". *': Follows \\"Áä¨\\" with extra throw (ÊíáÔºå‰∏ø), not as \\"Âèã\\" with extra dot. *„Éè: The structure of throw- dot (Êíá-ÁÇπ) on top of a horizontal stroke in a few characters such as \\"Âçä, \\"Âπ≥\\", \\"ËÇñ\\", this component should not be as \\"‰∏∑\\" shape. *': Follows \\"ÂÜ´\\" (water), not as two dots \\"‚∫Ä\\". *': Follows \\"„Ñó\\" , shaping like a person kneeling, not as \\"Èæ¥\\". *Â§Ñ: Right side follows \\"‰∫∫\\", not as \\"Âçú\\". *': Third stroke is a throw (ÊíáÔºå‰∏ø), not a dot(ÁÇπÔºå‰∏∂).  Separated components  *Âåö ¬∑ Âå∏: First is for \\"Âå°\\", \\"Âå±\\", \\"ÂåØ\\" etc.; second is for \\"Âåø\\", \\"ÂçÄ\\", \\"Âåπ\\" etc. *Âåï ¬∑ †§é: First is for \\"ËÉΩ\\", \\"ÊØî\\", \\"Ê≠§\\", \\"Èπø\\" etc.; second is for \\"Âåñ\\", \\"Ëä±\\" etc. *ÂçÇ ¬∑ Right side of Â∑©: First is for \\"ËøÖ\\", \\"Ë®ä\\", \\"Ê±õ\\" etc.; second is for \\"Â∑©\\", \\"ÊÅê\\", \\"Á≠ë\\" etc. *‰∏∏ ¬∑ Right side of Âü∑: First is for \\"‰∏∏\\", \\"Á¥à\\", \\"Ê±ç\\" etc.; second is for \\"ÁÜü\\", \\"ÁÜ±\\", \\"Âü∑\\", \\"Ëóù\\" etc. *Êúà ¬∑ ‚∫º ¬∑ ÂÜÜ ¬∑ Left side of Êúï: Respectively for \\"Êòé/Êúü/Êúó\\" (moon related); \\"ËÇå/ËÉé/ËÉ°\\" (meat related); \\"Èùë/Ê∑∏/Èùú\\"; \\"Êúç/Êúï/Âãù\\". *‚∫ù ¬∑ ÂÜÉ: First is for \\"ËÉÑ\\" etc.; second is for \\"ÂÜë\\", \\"ÂÜí\\" etc. *ÊÆ≥ ¬∑ Right side of Ê≤í: First is for \\"Ë®≠\\", \\"Ëà¨\\", \\"ÊÆµ\\" etc.; second is for \\"Ê≤í\\", \\"Ëéà\\", \\"Ê≠ø\\" etc. *ËÄÇ ¬∑ Top of ': First is for \\"Â≠ù\\", \\"Âóú\\" etc.; second is for \\"ËÄÖ\\", \\"Ë´∏\\" etc. *ß∂† ¬∑ Ë≥£: First is for \\"Á∫å\\", \\"ËÆÄ\\", \\"Ê´ù\\", \\"Á´á\\" etc.Ôºå\\"ß∂†\\" is the vocal part of pictophonetic characters; second is for \\"Ë≥£\\".

Checklist of Inherited Glyphs  \\"Checklist of Inherited Glyphs\\" is an open source public orthography standard compiled and released by civil open source organization \\"Ichitenfont\\". The standard and its annex is available for all font foundries to reference and follow. The checklist standard is made with philology research and striking a balance between philology research, orthography theory, current usage and aesthetics. Mixed components in current standards are separated and normalized to different character forms, and the most representative inherited character form is chosen as the recommended form. The standard also includes other orthography form that are seen in normal daily lives which also has legitimate philology source, providing font foundries more options to adjust and adapt the character forms that follows philology sources. = Example font = * I.Ming (I.ÊòéÈ´î, also known as \\"‰∏ÄÈªûÊòéÈ´î\\"), modified and extended from IPAmj Mincho * Hong Kong Character Set Project Traditional Orthography version  Other amorphous jiu zixing orthography standards  Character form before the Chinese Character Reformation = Before the Chinese Character Reformation, normal printing press used jiu zixing as the character standard. = Current generation amorphous standards = The style follows jiu zixing forms and styles, but some fonts may changed the strokes to follow current standard and become xin zixing, and not fully follow the character forms in jiu zixing or \\"Kangxi Dictionary\\".

As a two-year-old in 2019 he was one of the best colts of his generation in Europe, winning the Richmond Stakes, running second in the Middle Park Stakes and finishing third in the Prix Morny. On his first run as a three-year-old he won the Commonwealth Cup. Background Golden Horde is a chestnut colt with a white star bred in Ireland by CN Stables Ltd. As a yearling in August 2018 he was consigned to the Goffs UK Premier Yearling Sale and was bought for ¬£65,000 by the trainer Clive Cox who took him into traniing at his stable at Lambourn in Berkshire. Golden Horde races in the colours of AlMohamediya Racing and has been ridden in most of his races by Adam Kirby. He was from the second crop of foals sired by Lethal Force, an outstanding sprinter whose wins included the Diamond Jubilee Stakes and the July Cup. Golden Horde's dam Entreat showed modest racing ability, winning one minor races from eight starts. Her other foals have included the Pipalong Stakes winner Exhort. Entreat's dam River Saint was a half-sister to Serena's Song. Racing career=2019: two-year-old season On his racecourse debut Golden Horde started at odds of 6/1 for a maiden race over six furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 17 May and finished fourth of the twelve runners, three and a quarter lengths behind the winner Light Angel. On 3 May at Windsor Racecourse the colt started the 6/5 favourite for a Novice race (for horses with no more than two previous wins) and recorded his first success as he won \\"readily\\" by four and a half length from Indian Creak after leading from the start. He was then stepped up in class for the Group 2 Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot in which he started a 33/1 outsider and came home fifth of the seventeen runners behind Arizona, Threat, Guildsman and Fort Myers after hanging to the left in the closing stages. At Goodwood Racecourse on 1 August Golden Horde contested the Richmond Stakes and went off at odds of 15/2 in a thirteen-runner field which also include Threat (who started favourite) and Guildsman. After settling in second place behind the front-running Misty Grey he went to the front approaching the final furlong and got the better of a \\"sustained duel\\" with Threat to win by three quarters of a length. Clive Cox commented \\"He is very talented and has got a lot of ability and a great mind... He got into a lovely rhythm and Adam said that it didn't feel they were going that fast which is the sign of a good horse. I'm delighted with his progression and I still think he is improving... It was great to watch the last 50 yards as he was gaining, not folding.\\" Seventeen days after his win at Goodwood, Golden Horde was sent to France for the Group 1 Prix Morny over 1200 metres on heavy ground at Deauville Racecourse and finished third behind Earthlight and the filly Raffle Prize with Arizona in fourth and A'Ali (Prix Robert Papin) in fifth. On his final run of the season, the colt faced his previous rivals Earthlight and Threat in the Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 28 September. Starting a 16/1 outsider he took the lead a furlong from the finish but was overtaken by Earthlight in the closing stages and beaten a neck into second place. In the official rating of European two- year-olds for 2019 Golden Horde was rated the seventh-best juvenile of the year behind Pinatubo, Earthlight, Kameko, Arizona, Millisle and Mums Tipple. 2020: three-year-old season The 2020 flat racing season in England was disrupted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Golden Horde did not reappear until 19 June when he started the 5/1 third favourite for the Commonwealth Cup over six furlongs at Royal Ascot. The Round Tower Stakes winner Lope Y Fernandez started favourite ahead of Pierre Lapin (Mill Reef Stakes) while the other thirteen runners included Millisle, Mums Tipple and the American-trained filly Kimari. Racing up the stands-side (the left side from the jockeys' viewpoint) he was in contention from the start, went to the front at half way and kept on well to win \\"readily\\" by a length and a half from Kimari with third place going to the 50/1 outsider Ventura Rebel. After the race Cox said \\"I was very proud of him. He's a lovely, big strong horse. He was a wonderful two-year- old, but with the size and scope, he's really strengthened into that frame as a three-year-old. He's uncomplicated and has a great cruising speed... He couldn't have pleased me more\\". On 11 July Golden Horde was matched against older horses for the first time in the Group 1 July Cup over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse and started the 2/1 favourite in a twelve-runner field. He took the lead soon after the start but was overtaken in the last quarter mile and finished third behind Oxted and the Irish challenger Sceptical.

Life  Lalandi-Emery was born in Athens in 13 July 1920, a date she tried to keep secret. Her father Nikolas Kaloyeropoulos was the director of the Byzantine Museum in Athens. She was trained at the Athens Conservatoire. She first came to notice when she was recognised for guiding allied troops through Athens during the Second World War. Her first marriage resulted in her having the surname Waller-Bridge. In 1962 she changed her name to Lina Madeleine Lalandi- Emery as she was in a relationship with a banker named Ralph Emery and he was already married. Ralph Emery's wife refused to grant him a divorce, but Lina enjoyed the benefits of her new partner's wealth. It is estimated that he paid two million pounds, over the years, to subsidise the English Bach Festival. The festival began in 1963 with Lalandi and Jack Westrup as joint artistic director of the English Bach Festival. The festival was originally in Oxford but in time it moved to London. It had Bach as a theme; Lalandi wrote in 1963 that the festival would also include \\"20th-century composers whose way of thinking is nearer to [Bach's] than to that of the Romantic age.\\"Rubinoff, Kailan (2013). \\"A revolution in sheep's wool stockings: Early music and '1968'\\" in Beate Kutschke and Barley Norton (eds.)

In 1975 she was included in the 1975 New Year Honours.

The TAF's headquarters was provided by the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing and it was the largest joint aviation unit under Marine Corps command during World War II. During the battle, the TAF was commanded by Major General Francis P. Mulcahy until ill-health forced him to be relieved by MajGen Louis E. Woods. According to United States sources, TAF aircraft were responsible for shooting down 637 Japanese aircraft during the battle. Missions *To establish headquarters and tactical units ashore as soon as practicable after L-Day. *To execute the air support mission assigned by the Commander, Joint Expeditionary Force, as long as he functioned as such in the area. *Thereafter, to provide for air defense and air support for the ground and supporting surface forces in the Okinawa area by application of available air power as dictated by the overall situation and as directed by higher. History=Organization and Planning MajGen Francis P. Mulcahy, first Commanding General of the Tactical Air Force, Tenth Army. The Tactical Air Force, Tenth Army (TAF) was activated at Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Territory of Hawaii on November 21, 1944 under the command of Major General Francis P. Mulcahy, then commander of the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing. 2nd MAW was chosen to lead the TAF because it had recent combat experience from Peleliu and more importantly it was available in Hawaii as planning for the invasion began to ramp up. When first formed, TAF's Marine Corps and United States Army Air Forces units were scattered across the Pacific Theater. Expecting a very large number of kamikaze attacks, MajGen Mulcahy selected his Chief of Staff, Brigadier General William J. Wallace, to serve as the head of TAF's most important task unit, the Air Defense Command. The ADC was initially responsible for overseeing the day and night fighters squadrons from three Marine Aircraft Groups and the four ground based early warning squadrons. BGen Wallace was a seasoned veteran who had previous combat experience as a Marine Air Group commander during the Guadalcanal Campaign. Marine Aircraft Group 43 (MAG-43), under the command of one of the most experienced radar officers in the Marine Corps Robert O. Bisson, was also brought from Marine Corps Air Station El Centro, California to Hawaii to serve as the administrative headquarters for the TAF. Planning for Okinawa continued while TAF struggled to get its staff together. The headquarters was not basically organized until December 1944 by which time the invasion plan was well along. By the time that the first echelon of TAF personnel embarked upon naval shipping at Pearl Harbor in late February 1945, TAF consisted of 112 officers and 398 enlisted personnel. The plan that developed for the invasion of Okinawa was very straight forward with only a few modifications installed to improve air to ground coordination, incorporate more than one ground based radar squadron and integrate a large number of night fighter squadrons. TAF planners envisioned the units primary missions as follows: *1) Establish headquarters and tactical units ashore as soon as practicable after L-Day. *2) Execute the air support mission assigned by the Commander, Joint Expeditionary Force, as long as he functioned as such in the area. *3) Provide air defense and air support for the ground and supporting surface forces in the Okinawa area by application of availaable air power as dictated by the overall situation and as directed by higher authority. =Air Defense Command= TAF's Air Defense Command was tasked with the following missions: * Commanding all fighter aircraft assigned to TAF in execution of all assigned defensive and offensive missions. * Establishing Air Defense Command and an Air Defense Control Center as soon as possible. * Assuming control of air defense including AA artillery and searchlights from Commander Air Support Control Units on order. * Establishing and operating an early air warning net. * Furnishing direct defense of the area in conjunction with Fleet aircraft present. * Being prepared from time of initial establishment for emergency assistance to shipborne Air Support Control Units in handling carrier based aircraft forced to land ashore. OkinawaGetting established= SCR-270 Radar from Air Warning Squadron 6 AWS-8 radar vans on Aguni Shima Kadena and Yontan Airfields were seized by 1230 on L-Day, April 1, 1945. Engineers immediately began to expand and repair the runways. The first TAF aircraft to come ashore on Okinawa were Marine Corps OY-1 Grasshoppers from VMO-3. MAG-43's Air Defense Control Center (ADCC), callsign \\"Handyman\\", established itself in a position between Yontan Airfield and Kadena Airfield and took control of the air defense fight ashore on April 7, 1945. The ADCC was initially operated from the back of two LVTs. On April 16th, MAG-43 established its full ADCC in a farmer's house about a half mile southeast of Yontan Airfield in the village of Yomitan. Initially Air Warning Squadron 7 and Air Warning Squadron 8 were the only two ground based early warning units detailed to land during the first few days after D-Day. AWS-7 moved north with the Marine Divisions and established itself at Hedo Point once it was secured. AWS-8 landed with the 77th Infantry Division before D-Day to secure Zamami Shima on March 27, 1945. Air Warning Squadrons 1 and Air Warning Squadron 6 were scheduled to land later in April. These units were tasked to work in conjunction with the Navy's radar picket ships off the coast. Because of the kamikaze threat it was quickly determined that the initial two air warning squadrons were insufficient for the task. One of the Navy's great lesson's learned from the Battle of Okinawa was that failure to secure outlying islands and install adequate ground based radar coverage was partially responsible for the devastating losses that the radar picket ships suffered. By June 30, MAG-43 consisted of 1,926 Marines with another 505 attached US Army personnel. =Air Defense Fight= Marine Aircraft Group 31 (MAG-31) was the first Marine air group ashore landing on Yontan Airfield on April 7th. Flying in from the escort carriers USS Sitkoh Bay and the USS Breton (CVE-23), the group was able to immediately put 80 of 109 F4U Corsairs into the fight and maintained a combat air patrol from 1750 until dark to aid in the fight against the kamikaze attacks that were devastating the American fleet. Marine Aircraft Group 33 was next ashore on April 9th. On April 14th, responsibility for providing CAP aircraft for Okinawa was transferred from the Navy's Task Force 58 to the TAF. That same day TAF was also tasked with providing an additional two plane CAP's for three of the Navy's radar picket stations. By the end of April the TAF had two Marine Aircraft Groups ashore giving them six F4U Corsair squadrons and two night fighter squadrons equipped with Grumman F6F Hellcats TAF initially maintained a CAP of 12 aircraft overhead however as the kamikaze threat grew it increased to 32 aircraft overhead with an additional 12 aircraft on ground alert. For the month, TAF aircraft had flown 3,521 combat air patrols sorties and were responsible for assisting in the shooting down on 143 enemy aircraft. May 1945 saw TAF strength increased with the addition of Marine Aircraft Group 22 and the 318th Fighter Group. With the additional aircraft assigned the combat air patrols were pushed further north of Okinawa. During May TAF aircraft flew more that 6,700 sorties in defense of the island and naval shipping claiming 369 enemy aircraft shot down. Not all of the action for the TAF was in the skies over Okinawa. On May 24, the Japanese mounted Operation Gi-gou: a company of Giretsu Kuteitai commandos were airlifted in a suicide attack on Yomitan. They destroyed of fuel and nine planes before being killed by the defenders, who lost two men.During the same period TAF lost 109 aircraft with only three lost to direct enemy action. At the end of May and into June, the remainder of the fighter squadrons from the United States Army Air Corps's 301st Fighter Wing and Marine Aircraft Group 14 arrived. Eventually, ADC commanded a total of 25 fighter squadrons. Between June 3-7, fighters from the TAF engaged the ninth massed kamikaze attack of the campaign. Of the 118 enemy planes shot down, TAF aircraft accounted for 35 of them. =Close Air Support= A Marine Corps F4U Corsair fires its rockets at a Japanese stronghold on Okinawa. The original plan for the Battle of Okinawa had called for a significant portion of assigned aviation assets to conduct close air support (CAS). This did not come to fruition during the battle because of the kamikaze threat, difficult terrain and the nature of Japanese cave defenses. The nature of the kamikaze threat also meant that the defense of Okinawa from attack by the air became their primary mission. Because of the focus on air defense, approximately 60% of the close air support sorties during the battle were provided by Marine and Navy aircraft flying from Task Force 58's escort carriers. In fact, the first CAS sorties by TAF aircraft did not occur until April 13th and for the month of April only 20% of available sorties were tasked with conducting CAS. A newly established command and control agency was utilized to coordinate and direct close air support missions during the battle. Three Landing Force Air Support Control Units (LFASCU), under the command of Colonel Vernon E. Megee, came ashore on the first day of the invasion and established their agencies ashore. LFASCU 1 was in support of the V Amphibious Corps, while LFASCU-2 supported the Army's XXIV Corps and LFASCU-3 coordinated close air support for the higher headquarters of the Tenth Army. =After the battle and disbandment= TAF's Bomber Command was originally planned to consist of the 41st Bomber Group (Medium) and the 319th Bomber Group (Light). These two groups did not begin operations on Okinawa until late June/early July. At the same time, two heavy bomber groups were also added - the 494th and 11th Bomber Groups (Heavy). With a large number of forces and a very limited mission as the fighting on Okinawa subsided in June, the Tactical Air Force began executing missions against targets in the Northern Ryukus, Kyushu, and China. It was at this point that the headquarters designed for the Battle of Okinawa was no longer needed and the unit was disbanded on July 13, 1945. Marine squadrons were transferred to the newly established Ryukuan Command and Army Air Corps assets reverted to the tactical control of the Far East Air Force. During its existence TAF squadrons flew a total of 38,192 sorties and claimed shooting down 625 enemy aircraft as well as engaging Japanese shipping and providing close air support. During three months of combat over the skies of Okinawa, Marine squadrons assigned to the TAF accounted for 484¬Ω planes shot down helping to create 21 new Marine Corps aces. MAG-33 had the most of any single Marine air group claiming 214 shoot-downs.

His involvement in Triangular trade, particularly diamond and precious wood trading between Europe and South America, earned him a vast fortune. He became a major benefactor for his home town, Neuch√¢tel, where he funded the construction of schools, hospitals, government buildings, and served as a patron of various local charities. De Pury has become a controversial figure in the 21st-century for his connection to the Atlantic slave trade through his business endeavors in Latin America.  Biography  De Pury was born on 19 January 1709 in Neuch√¢tel, Kingdom of Prussia (in present-day Switzerland), one of eight children of the geographer and explorer Jean-Pierre Pury and Lucr√®ce Chaillet. His father, with the permission of English colonial governor Robert Johnson, founded the Colony of Purrysburg, a colony in the British Empire for Swiss Protestants, in present day South Carolina. De Pury's father died in Purrysburg, and was succeeded by his elder son Charles. Charles de Pury was killed during a slave revolt in the colony in 1754. In 1725 de Pury left Switzerland and moved to Marseille, France where he worked in maritime trade with the merchant Isaac Tarteiron for three years. In 1730 he was hired by the South Sea Company, trading imported goods from African and American ports. The South Sea Company was active in the Atlantic slave trade. His success as a businessman in the company led to him obtaining British citizenship. In 1736 he moved to Lisbon, Portugal and co- founded, with Joseph Mellish, a bank called Pury, Mellish, & Devismes. From Portugal, de Pury established a business importing diamonds from Brazil, trading them in London's financial center. He also became involved in the trading of woods from the Amazon rainforest, including mahogany and jacaranda. In 1762 he was appointed a banker to Joseph I of Portugal. He bequeathed a large part of his fortune to the city and the bourgeoisie of Neuch√¢tel, used to repair buildings and churches, fund the construction of the town hall, establish local charities, build a public library, and build schools and hospitals. The sum of the inheritance the city received was the modern equivalent of CHF 600 million. The Bronze statue of the baron in Neuch√¢tel, sculpted by David d'Angers, has been a source of debate in Switzerland. In 1785 de Pury was ennobled to the rank of freiherr by Frederick II of Prussia. He died on 31 May 1786 in Lisbon. He is buried at the English cemetery at St. George's Church.  Legacy and controversy  A portrait of de Pury, painted by Thomas Hickey, hangs in the charter room in the town hall in Neuch√¢tel. A bronze statue of de Pury, designed by David d'Angers, stands in the town square in Neuch√¢tel. In June 2020 the Collectif Pour La M√©moire petitioned to have the statue in Neuch√¢tel removed since the majority of his wealth came from investments and holdings in industries that depended on forced labor of enslaved African people, inspired by the numerous monuments removed in response to the killing of George Floyd in the United States.https://www.20min.ch/fr/story/petition-pour-deboulonner-la-statue-de- david-de-pury-179943452455 [archive] The Collectif Pour La M√©moire stated in their petition, signed by over 2,000 people, that \\"the money inherited by David de Pury, at his death in 1786, was used to carry out a large number of works in the town of Neuch√¢tel but it was won by the blood of black people from Africa forced into slavery in the 18th century.‚Üë https://www.tdg.ch/petition-deposee-pour-deboulonner-la-statue-de-david-de- pury-229324832023 [archive] It is our responsibility to challenge this legacy and refuse to allow anyone who has contributed to the suffering of more than 55,000 slaves to be seen as a benefactor.\\" They also asked that a plaque commemorating those who suffered from racism and white supremacy replace the statue. By 13 July 2020 the petition had been signed by over 2,5000 people. The petition was criticized by Nicolas de Pury, a member of the de Pury family and elected representative of the Green Party to the General Council of Neuch√¢tel. He suggested that more historical research be done on his ancestor, and include his history with slavery on a plaque under the statue. De Pury also called for allocating funds to a historian to \\"shed light\\" on de Pury's entire life. Late in the night on 12 July 2020 the statue of de Pury was vandalized by protesters. Red paint, symbolizing blood of enslaved Africans, was smeared across the statue. An email was sent to Arcinfo by the group responsible titled A Monument for Those Resisting Colonialism, Not for Slavers. The statue was cleaned the following morning.

Subfamily classification  The Platystomatidae were comprehensively divided into five subfamilies Frey, R (1932). On African Platystomatidae (Diptera). Annals and Magazine of Natural History, Series 10. 9: 242‚Äì264., but more recent reviews of morphology suggest that some aspects of this classification are unsatisfactory. This led to reducing the number of subfamilies to four, being the Plastotephritinae, Platystomatinae, Scholastinae and Trapherinae - Angitulinae being subsumed into Platystomatinae. Nonetheless, definition of the subfamily Plastotephritinae is still open to debate and requires phylogenetic confirmation. At present, genera assigned to the subfamily are considered as having the following subset of characters: an evanescent subcostal vein, reduced lower calypter, tergites 4 and 5 much shorter than tergite 3, distiphallus terminating at the glans (i.e. no terminal filaments) and tergite 6 in the female abdomen absent or vestigial. The head morphology of the subfamily is exceptional and variable including 9 different types of modification in 16 genera.Whittington, A E (2006). \\"Extreme head morphology in Plastotephritinae (Diptera, Platystomatidae), with a proposition of classification of head structures in Acalyptrate Diptera\\". Instrumenta Biodiversitatis. VII: 61-83. Four of the 18 genera in the Trapherinae are monotypic: Eudasys, Micronesomyia, Prosopoconus, and Rhegmatosaga.  Biology  Little is known of the biology of Plastotephrines. The complex mating behaviour observed in the family Platystomatidae as a whole, and for which the name Signal flies has been bestowed on them, is also observed in Plastotephritinae, which utilize elaborate displays of the wings and face-to- face stand-offs during the process of mate selection. Many species have elaborated morphological modification to the head capsule (laterally extended gena or \\"cheeks\\"for example and eye stalks) to enhance agonistic behaviour. Peltacanthina speciesHabitats in which they are encountered range from rainforest to montane forest, woodland, bush, riparian and swamp habitats, lowland savannah, dry river beds. Larvae have not been reared and adult-plant associations are little indication of breeding sites. Nonetheless, the family Platystomatidae as a whole tend to be attracted to flowers, decaying fruit, excrement, sweat, and decomposing snails, with the larvae are found on fresh and decaying vegetation, carrion, human corpses - there is no reason to suppose the members of Plastotephrinae will differ. So far adults have been recorded on plants of Zea maize Zea, Prange afranjonum, Macaranga hurifolia Macaranga, and on fruit of Annona Annona (custard apple), Syzygium_jambos Syzygium jambos (rose apple) and Mangifera indica Mangifera indica (mango).  Biogeography  The largest concentration of Plastotephrine species occurs in the Afrotropical region, with only Agadasys and Rhegmatosaga known from the Oriental region - and then from few species and few specimens. Material from the Pacific Islands, New Guinea and Australia are yet to be revised and fully assessed, but the most recent assessments of these fanuas suggest that species and genera previously assigned to the subfamily, may in fact not belong there.McAlpine, D K (2001). \\"Review of the Australian Genera of Signal Flies (Diptera; Platystomatidae)\\". Records of the Australian Museum. 53: 113-199. Within the Afrotropical context, the distribution is mainly tropical to subtropical, predominantly in West, Central and East Africa, with minor elements in southern Africa and Madagascar. None are known to exist on the other Indian Ocean islands. There is a strong preference for forest and riverine habitats.  Taxonomic history  Richard Frey published one of the long lasting attempts at providing full family status Platystomatidae, and subfamily divisions within it. Despite that some of the subfamilies he proposed have now been sunk back into Platystomatinae, his use of Plastotephritinae in particular has been long lasting. In 1932 Frey attributed the name Plastotephritinae to Enderlein, although Enderlein treated the group at tribal level (hence Plastotephritini Enderlein, 1922). The correct stem for Plastotephritinae, based on Tephritis Latrille, 1804, is Plastotephritidinae and common usage of the shorter stem (Plastotephritinae and Plastotephritini) has prevailed and is used here following the decision of Sabrosky (1999) Sabrosky, C W (1999). \\"Family-Group Names in Diptera: an annotated catalog\\".

She is a Chair Professor at the University of Paris-Saclay. She is considered to be a pioneer in the field, with her invention of the support-vector machines with Vladimir Vapnik and Bernhard Boser.  Biography  After graduating from the French engineering school ESPCI Paris in 1985, she joined the group of Gerard Dreyfus at the Universit√© Pierre-et-Marie-Curie to do a PhD on neural networks architectures and training. Guyon defended her thesis in 1988 and was hired the year after at AT&T; Bell Laboratories, first as a post-doc, then as a group leader. She worked at Bell Labs for six years, where she explored several research areas, from neural networks to pattern recognition and computational learning theory, with application to handwriting recognition. She collaborated with Yann LeCun, L√©on Bottou, Vladimir Vapnik, Corinna Cortes, Yoshua Bengio, Patrice Simard, and met her future husband, Bernhard Boser In 1996, Guyon left Bell Labs and raised her children at Berkeley, California. In Berkeley, she created her own machine learning consulting company, Clopinet. She became interested in medical applications, and used her previous work to classify the genes responsible for different types of cancers. Since 2003, Guyon has organized many challenges in data science, in order to stimulate research in this field. She founded ChaLearn in 2011, a non-profit organization aimed at creating machine learning challenges open to everyone. She was Program Chair of NeurIPS 2016 et became General Chair of NeurIPS in 2017. She is also Action Editor for the Journal of Machine Learning Research and Series Editor for Series: Challenges in Machine Learning. She is a member of the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems. In 2016, Guyon came back to France to take the Chair Professorship in Big data between the University of Paris-Saclay and INRIA. She works in the group TAU (TAckling the Underspecified) of the Laboratoire de recherche en informatique. With Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf and Vladimir Vapnik, she received in 2020 the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Awards for her work in machine learning.  Scientific work  Guyon has worked in many subfields of machine learning, including neural networks, support-vector machines, feature selection and applications of machine learning to biology.  Support-vector machines  Among her most notable contributions, Guyon co-invented support-vector machines (SVM) in 1992, with Bernhard Boser and Vladimir Vapnik. SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm, comparable to neural networks or decision trees, which has quickly become a classical technique in machine learning. SVMs have especially contributed to the popularization of kernel methods.  Neural networks  During her years at Bell Labs, Guyon took part of numerous projects involving neural networks. In particular, she wrote some of the first papers on the use of neural network for handwriting recognition using the MNIST database. She is also a co- inventor of the siamese neural networks, a neural network architecture used to learn similarities, with applications to signature, face or object recognition. Machine learning for biology Guyon is the author of many publications at the intersection of biology (cancer research and genomics) and artificial intelligence. She has notably introduced the use of support-vector machines to detect cancer using genes.  Machine learning challenges  Through her non-profit organization Chalearn, Guyon has organized and directed challenges open to everyone in order to solve open problems in machine learning, including computer vision, neurosciences, particle physics, feature selection and automated machine learning. Most of the challenges organized by ChaLearn have resulted in publications. Among the most cited ones are: * Guyon et al., Result analysis of the NIPS 2003 feature selection challenge, Advances in neural information processing systems, 2005, link * Escalera et al., ChaLearn Looking at People Challenge 2014: Dataset and Results, Computer Vision - ECCV 2014 Workshops, Springer International Publishing, 2014, link * Guyon et al., A brief Review of the ChaLearn AutoML Challenge, JMLR: Workshop and Conference Proceedings 64:21-30, 2016, link * Adam-Bourdario et al., The Higgs boson machine learning challenge, JMLR: Workshop and Conference Proceedings 42:19-55, 2015, link Private life She is married to Bernhard Boser, a professor at UC Berkeley. She has twins and one daughter, all three of whom have completed a science degree. Guyon has three citizenships: French by birth, Swiss by marriage and American by naturalization.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 U.S. ____ (2020) was a U.S. Supreme Court case which determined that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), with a single director who could only be removed from office \\"for cause\\", violates the separation of powers. The Court's 5‚Äì4 decision, issued on June 29, 2020, recognized that the directorship position was severable from the statute that established the CFPB, allowing the CFPB to continue to operate.  Background  The CFPB was envisioned by Elizabeth Warren while she was a law professor at Harvard Law School, it was brought into being through the 2010 Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The CFPB was designed to protect consumers and promote regulations to prevent similar events such as the Great Recession that ran from 2007 to 2009. To be able to promote these regulations, it was determined that agency needed to be independent, and thus it was established to have a single Director, selected by the President with confirmation by the Senate, appointed to a five-year term, and who could only be removed for \\"malfeasance, inefficiency or neglect of duty\\", as set by . Since its establishing, the CFPB has actively gone after banks and other financial service providers that have determined to be \\"bad actors\\". Notably, the CFPB was a major player in the Wells Fargo account fraud scandal. The CFPB was established under President Barack Obama and the Democratic-led Congress, and had been seen as a bane by the Republican Party as a sign of government overreach. In the years after it was established, the Republicans gained control of the Senate, and Donald Trump became President in 2017, putting the CFPB under scrutiny. Businesses that also shared this dismissive view of the CFPB began to file lawsuits to try to challenge the agency's legality. These lawsuits focused on the for-cause termination statute around the CFPB's directorship position. For-cause removal of agency executives presents a prima facie challenge to the separation of powers, because it places a limit‚Äîimposed by Congress, a co-equal branch of government‚Äîon the President's Article II authority over executive branch officials. Accordingly, the constitutionality of the CFPB's organizational structure has been subject to extensive litigation. Most courts that have considered the question have found that for- cause removal of the CFPB Director is constitutional. The Supreme Court has previously held that for-cause removal is constitutional in Humphrey's Executor v. United States (Humphrey's Executor) and Morrison v. Olson (Morrison), at least where the agency in question exercises \\"quasi- legislative\\" or \\"quasi-judicial\\" functions. However, the Court reached the opposite conclusion in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a case in which officers of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board had two levels of protection against presidential removal.  Facts and procedural history  Seila Law LLC (Seila Law), a law firm that provided debt relief services, was under investigation by the CFPB. As part of its investigation, the CFPB issued a civil investigative demand (CID) to Seila Law, which required Seila Law to produce certain documents. Seila Law declined to comply with the CID and challenged the constitutionality of the CFPB. The CFPB brought a motion to enforce the CID to the United States District Court for the Central District of California, where District Judge Josephine Staton granted the motion after finding the CFPB was constitutionally structured. Seila Law's appeal to the Ninth Circuit was dismissed. The 9th Circuit panel affirmed the District Court's ruling, and agreed that the Supreme Court's prior decisions upholding for-cause removal in Humphrey's Executor and Morrison were \\"controlling.\\" It also referred approvingly to the en banc decision of the DC Circuit in PHH Corp. v. CFPB (2018), in which the Circuit found that the structure of the CFPB was constitutional. There was arguably a circuit split on the question presented in Seila Law. While the Ninth Circuit and DC Circuit had held that the CFPB's structure is constitutional, the Fifth Circuit in Collins v. Mnuchin (2018) held that the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Agency‚Äîanother agency whose director can be removed only for cause‚Äîviolated the separation of powers. Supreme Court The Supreme Court granted certiorari in Seila Law on October 18, 2019, and heard oral argument on March 3, 2020. The Court issued its decision on June 29, 2020. The 5‚Äì4 decision ruled that the CFPB structure, with a sole director that could only be terminated for cause, was unconstitutional as it violated the separation of powers, vacating the lower court judgement and remanding the case for review. The Court recognized that the statutes around the director of the CFPB was severable from the rest statute establishing the agency, and thus \\"The agency may therefore continue to operate, but its Director, in light of our decision, must be removable by the President at will.\\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh. Roberts wrote that the CFPB structure with a single point of leadership that could only be removed for cause \\"has no foothold in history or tradition\\", and has only used in four other instances: three current uses for the United States Office of Special Counsel, the Social Security Administration, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and temporarily for one year during the American Civil War for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Roberts wrote that the three current uses \\"these examples are modern and contested; and they do not involve regulatory or enforcement authority comparable to that exercised by the CFPB.\\" Roberts also wrote that the CFPB structure \\"is also incompatible with the structure of the Constitution, which ‚Äî with the sole exception of the Presidency ‚Äî scrupulously avoids concentrating power in the hands of any single individual.\\" Roberts referred back to the precedent established by Humphrey's Executor and Morrison as a basis for the majority's decision. Thomas wrote a partial concurrence joined by Gorsuch, adding that he believed that Humphrey's Executor should be overturned and all \\"for cause\\" terminations positions should be considered unconstitutional. Thomas also wrote that he believed there was no need to resolve the severability matter for the specific case at hand. Justice Elena Kagan wrote the dissent joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor. Kagan wrote that \\"Today's decision wipes out a feature of that agency its creators thought fundamental to its mission ‚Äî a measure of independence from political pressure.\\" Kagan challenged the separation of powers argument presented by the majority: \\"Nowhere does the text [of the Constitution] say anything about the President's power to remove subordinate officials at will.\\" The dissenting Justices did concur on the matter of severability of the remaining structure of the CFPB outside of the director.  Commentary  An alert published by Holland & Knight noted that the litigation posture of Seila Law is unusual, as the CFPB has declined to defend the constitutionality of its own structure before the Supreme Court. Thomas A. Barnico, a professor at Boston College Law School, noted that the case raised federalism issues. In particular, he suggested that the CFPB's power to pre-empt state legislation presents special concerns regarding accountability for its leadership.Brief for the Respondents , Seila Law v. CFPB, p. 7. Impact Subsequent to the Seila Law decision, the Supreme Court certified the petition to the Fifth Circuit decision on Collins v. Mnuchin related to the Federal Housing Finance Agency that had been established with the same single-administrator position, dismissable only for cause, as the CFPB. The case was scheduled to be heard in the 2020 term.

The key issues in the litigation evolved significantly during the appeals process, meaning that the issues addressed by the Supreme Court differed from those considered by the Court of Appeal, which in turn were different from those which were considered at first instance by the Vice Chancellor. However, by the time the case reached the Supreme Court the core issue was whether a transfer of trust property to a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, which extinguished the beneficial interest of a company in liquidation, was void as a \\"disposition of property\\" after the commencement of winding up. The case involved consideration of several issues of law which the Supreme Court described as \\"novel and difficult\\".Akers v Samba (Supreme Court), at para 1. The appeal was heard against an application to determine a preliminary issue. Accordingly for the purposes of the hearing the allegations were assumed to be true. The Supreme Court held that the claim should be either stayed or struck out, but deferred making an order as to which pending further representations from the parties. Facts Mr Al-Sanea was a citizen and resident of Saudi Arabia, and he was closely involved with a Cayman Islands company, Saad Investments Co Ltd (SICL). At the time of the proceedings SICL was in liquidation in the Cayman Islands, and represented by its liquidators. Those legal proceedings had been subject to a recognition order in the English courts. Mr Al-Sanea was the registered legal owner of shares in five Saudi Arabian banks, valued at around US$318 million. SICL claims that Mr Al-Sanea had agreed to hold these shares on trust for SICL. The trusts were claimed to arise from six transactions under which Mr Al-Sanea had agreed in writing to hold the shares on trust for SICL. On 16 September 2009, Mr Al-Sanea transferred all the Saudi Arabian shares to the Samba Financial Group (Samba), purporting thereby to discharge his personal liabilities towards Samba. The law of Saudi Arabia, where the shares are legally situated, does not recognise the institution of trust or a division between legal and equitable proprietary interests. The proceedings were brought by SICL and its liquidators against Samba in the English courts. They established jurisdiction by serving Samba's London branch. In the proceedings they claimed that the purported transfer of the shares was void under section 127 of the Insolvency Act 1986, and the shares beneficially belonged to SICL for the benefit of its creditors. Samba opposed the application on a number of legal and procedural grounds. Although the liquidation was conducted under Cayman Islands law, it was common ground in the proceedings that once the insolvency proceedings had been recognised, section 127 would apply to any subsequent disposition of SICL's property. Judgments=High Court Sir Terence Etherton In the High Court the case came before the Vice Chancellor, Sir Terence Etherton. He noted that Samba was a Saudi bank, but had been served with English legal proceedings through its London branch. Before Sir Terence the case was fought principally on the basis that the proceedings in England should be subject to stay under the doctrine of forum non conveniens, ie. that the English courts were not the most appropriate courts to hear this case, and that the case should properly be determined by the Saudi courts as the case related to title to shares in Saudi companies. Sir Terence held that, for the reasons set out in his judgment a stay should be granted.Akers v Samba (High Court), at para 53. The liquidators appealed to the Court of Appeal. Court of Appeal In the Court of Appeal the case came before Longmore, Kitchin and Vos LJJ. Judgment was given by Vos LJ, who noted that \\"The argument before this court has also been markedly different from the argument before the Chancellor. Before us, the focus has been on the meaning and effect of article 4 of the [Hague Trust] Convention, whereas that article played almost no part in the first instance hearing.\\"Akers v Samba (CA), at para 4. The Court of Appeal noted: > ... the appeal raises some important questions as to the law applicable to > and the validity of trusts which purport to comprise shares registered in > civil law countries, whose laws do not themselves recognise either the trust > concept or the division of a legal and beneficial interest. These questions > have involved a close analysis of the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable > to Trusts and on their Recognition (the \\"Convention\\"), which was given > statutory effect in the United Kingdom by the Recognition of Trusts Act 1987 > (the \\"1987 Act\\").Akers v Samba (CA), at para 3. The Court of Appeal reversed the decision, and held that the matter could proceed to trial. Samba appealed to the Supreme Court. Supreme Court Lord Mance. Before the Supreme Court the nature of the arguments had evolved once again. The main judgment was given by Lord Mance, with whom all members of the court agreed. Short concurring judgments were given by Lord Neuberger, Lord Sumption and Lord Collins. Whilst Lord Mance dealt with the primary issue (relating to section 127), most of the concurring judgments largely commented on ancillary issues of wider law which related to the broader issues in the case. In the Supreme Court the primary issue was whether the overreaching of a beneficial interest in trust property by the trustee transferring it to a bona fide purchaser for value without notice amounted to a \\"disposition\\" for the purposes of section 127 of the Insolvency Act 1986. If so, then it would be void unless the court otherwise ordered. Samba argued that extinguishing an equitable interest in this manner was not a disposition. It simply meant that equity would no longer recognise a right in the beneficiary that formerly existed. =Lord Mance (paras 1 - 59)= After setting out the facts and the history, Lord Mance referenced the specific statutory provisions in issue: section 127 and section 436 of the Insolvency Act 1986. Those provisions state: > 127\\\\. Avoidance of property dispositions, etc. In a winding up by the court, > any disposition of the company's property, and any transfer of shares, or > alteration in the status of the company's members, made after the > commencement of the winding up is, unless the court otherwise orders, void. > ... ... 436\\\\. 'property' includes money, goods, things in action, land and > every description of property wherever situated and also obligations and > every description of interest, whether present or future or vested or > contingent, arising out of, or incidental to, property; ... He then reviewed the position in relation to the Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition, which was brought into force in the United Kingdom pursuant to the Recognition of Trusts Act 1987. But then largely dismissed that as background, noting: \\"In the light of the further and more broadly ranging submissions which the Supreme Court has now received, I doubt if it matters for present purposes either whether the Convention applies or even whether SICL's interests in relation to the shares can properly be described as proprietary. The limited focus in the courts below, on the issue whether the trusts gave SICL equitable proprietary interests in the shares, is largely subsumed in a more general question whether, whatever the nature of SICL's interests under the trusts, there was any disposition of property within the meaning of section 127.\\"Akers v Samba (SC), at para 14. He proceeded to review the law as to what constitutes property, with particular reference to equitable interests. He noted that whether or not a transfer of property defeated any equitable interest was a matter for the lex situs of the relevant property (so, in this case, Saudi Arabia as the place where the shares were located).Akers v Samba (SC), at para 20. He noted that in Attorney General v Jewish Colonization Association [1901] 1 QB 123 and Duke of Marlborough v Attorney General [1945] 1 Ch 78 it was held that foreign shares which were held on trust were taxable as on a succession. The Succession Duty Act 1853 provided: \\"every past, or future disposition of property ... shall be deemed to confer ... 'a succession'\\", and the courts had held these general words applied to the trust property even though the property consisted of foreign shares. He also referred to British South Africa Co v De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd [1910] 2 Ch 502 where the Court of Appeal held that the equitable rule against clogging the equity of redemption of a mortgage applied to a contract governed by English law and would be enforced against a contracting party as regards land abroad in a foreign country where the equity of redemption may not be recognised. He also referred more broaldy to the rule in Penn v Lord Baltimore (1750) 1 Ves Sen 444, and the recent application of the rule in Lightning v Lightning Electrical Contractors Ltd (1998) 23(1) Tru LI 35 and . Lord Mance then readily conceded: \\"I have found this a difficult issue.\\"Akers v Samba (SC), at para 45. He then turned to consider various academic opinions, including in particular Professor William Swadling of Oxford University. He approved a statement by Swadling in Burrows (ed.), English Private Law, at para 4.149 regarding \\"the falsity of statements which talk in terms of a 'division' or 'separation' of rights when rights are held on trust, or even worse, of legal and equitable 'titles' existing before the creation of the trust.\\"Akers v Samba (SC), at para 50. But he refused to be drawn into the deeper academic debate: \\"It is unnecessary on this appeal to examine these slightly differing analyses further. What is clear, on any analysis, is that, where a trust exists, the legal and beneficial interests are distinct, and what affects the former does not necessarily affect the latter.\\"Akers v Samba (SC), at para 51. Finally he concluded: > 53\\\\. In these circumstances, I conclude that section 127 is neither aimed > at, nor apt to cover, the present situation. Section 127 addresses cases > where assets legally owned by a company in winding up are disposed of. The > section is necessary to enable the company to recover them, by treating the > disposition as void. The court's power to validate the disposition is a > necessary safety valve, to cater for situations in which validation would be > appropriate, bearing in mind the position of creditors as well as that of > the other party to the transaction. Any such disposition will involve issues > which arise directly between the company (embracing in that concept its > creditors in liquidation) whose property is disposed of and the other party > to the transaction, although the section embraces situations where the > company's property is held by, for example, a director or agent and is > disposed of by him to a third party: In re J Leslie Engineers Co Ltd [1976] > 1 WLR 292. 54\\\\. The holder of interests such as SICL's does not need > protection on the lines of section 127, in order to protect its property or > to protect or enforce its interests. Mr Al-Sanea disposed of his legal > interest in the shares. That involved him in a breach of trust. But it did > not involve any disposition of SICL's property. He added that: \\"In some circumstances, the term \\"disposition\\" may, as Lord Neuberger demonstrates, embrace destruction or extinction of an interest. ... But the natural meaning of \\"disposition\\" in the context of section 127 is in my view that it refers to a transfer by a disponor to a disponee of the relevant property\\".Akers v Samba (SC), at para 55. He directed that the appeal be allowed and the case remitted back to the High Court for directions. He noted that this would enable an application to be made, if appropriate, to save the proceedings by amendment of the pleadings. =Lord Neuberger (paras 58 - 78)= Lord Neuberger summarised the facts briefly, and then turned to the direct issue in the case as to whether the overreaching of the beneficial interest in trust property could be a \\"disposition\\" for the purposes section 127 of the Insolvency Act 1986. He stated that: \\"There is no doubt but that SICL's equitable interest in the shares constituted \\"property\\" in the light of the very wide definition of that expression in section 436 of the 1986 Act, which is set out in para 7 of Lord Mance's judgment. He cited with approval what Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C said in Bristol Airport Plc v Powdrill [1990] Ch 744, 759, \\"[i]t is hard to think of a wider definition of property\\".\\"Akers v Samba (SC), at para 60. But the bigger issue was whether overreaching is a disposition. He noticed overreaching is \\"where a legal estate is sold to a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, any equitable interest is not transferred to the purchaser: it is overridden, or to put it more colloquially, it is lost or disappears\\".Akers v Samba (SC), at para 62. He expressed his view that the word \\"disposition\\" is linguistically capable of applying to a transaction which involves the destruction or termination of an interest.Akers v Samba (SC), at para 66. (Lord Mance had issued some partial support for this proposition, but Lord Sumption would expressly state his disagreement with it in his own judgment.) He claimed academic support for such a view, citing Professor Sir Roy Goode in Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law (4th ed (2011) at para 13-127). He also drew support from Wynn-Parry J in In re Earl Leven, Inland Revenue Comrs v Williams Deacon's Bank Ltd [1954] 1 WLR 1228, 1233. Having considered that point obiter dictum, he indicated: \\"I have reached the conclusion, in agreement with Lord Mance, that there is no \\"disposition\\" of an equitable interest within section 127, when there is a transfer by the legal owner of the legal estate, which is subject to that equitable interest, to a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of that equitable interest.\\"Akers v Samba (SC), at para 72. =Lord Sumption (paras 79 - 82)= Lord Sumption. Lord Sumption also commented on the evolution of the case - from a forum non conveniens application, to an appeal in relation to the effects of the Hague Convention in front of the Court of Appeal, to deciding the issue on the basis of the extra territorial effect on section 127 in the Supreme Court. He then proceeded to review much of the background law in relation to the fact pattern, noting that as the beneficiary of a trust, SICL had two main legal rights. First, it had a right to have the trust administered according to its terms - a personal right against the trustee. Secondly, SICL had a true proprietary right. He noted that the proprietary character of an equitable interest in property has sometimes been doubted, but an equitable interest possesses the essential hallmark of any right in rem, and it is enforceable against third parties, subject to the rules of equity for the protection of bona fide purchasers for value without notice, per Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council [1996] AC 669, 705.Akers v Samba (SC), at para 82. He then considered what, as a matter of the conflict of laws, which law should determine recognition of an equitable interest. Normally, he noted, it will be the lex situs. This would be obvious in the case of land, but is equally true of shares. Shares in a company are legal rights against that company, dependent on the law of its incorporation. The principle is the same as that which applies where a person assumes a contractual obligation to transfer an interest which is incapable of existing under the lex situs. He approved the statement by Lord Hodge in In re Joint Administrators of Rangers Football Club Plc 2012 SLT 599, para 19: \\"while the contractual aspects of a contract to assign corporeal moveables are governed by the law applicable to the contractual obligation, the final question of proprietary right must be determined by the lex situs.\\"Akers v Samba (SC), at para 84. But that deals with the second of the two rights (the right in rem). The first right (the personal right against the trustee) remains effective to create personal rights against the trustee even if the lex situs does not recognise the proprietary claim.Akers v Samba (SC), at para 85. He referred to El Ajou v Dollar Land Holdings plc [1993] BCC 698, 715-716. The liability of the constructive trustee was unaffected by any issue as to existence of rights in rem. SICL's problem was not that it lacked a beneficial interest in the shares, but that Mr Al-Sanea did not dispose of that beneficial interest by transferring the shares to Samba. Mr Al-Sanea purported to transfer the legal interest to Samba. That was the only interest that he had. He did not purport to dispose of SICL's interest. Only SICL could do that, and it did not do so. He noted that it is arguable (as Lord Neuberger had observed), that the transfer of the legal interest in movables may constitute a \\"disposition\\" of an equitable interest if its effect is that the equitable interest is extinguished. But Lord Sumption indicated that he would reject it is because of equity's recognition that in some circumstances the conscience of the holder of the legal interest may be affected. He affirmed: \\"The reality is that the transaction of 16 September 2009 was simply a transfer of the shares in breach of trust, and any rights of SICL against Samba depend on the law relating to constructive trusts and not on section 127 of the Insolvency Act.Akers v Samba (SC), at para 90. Finally he concluded that \\"for the purpose of section 127 of the Insolvency Act 1986 there was no disposition of any rights of SICL in relation to the shares by virtue of their transfer to Samba. Logically, it follows that the proceedings should be struck out. But I would remit the matter to the High Court to deal with any consequential matters, in case it be contended that they can be saved by an appropriate amendment to the pleadings.\\"Akers v Samba (SC), at para 92. Thus raising the possibility that the claim could be saved by an amendment to the pleadings. =Lord Collins (paras 93 - 103)= Lord Collins noted the unfortunate way that the arguments had evolved, to the extent that leave was given to appeal to the Supreme Court on one ground, and then largely argued on another. He said that \\"in the light of the way the claim was formulated, the real question was not one of the proper exercise of judicial jurisdiction, but rather a question of legislative jurisdiction, namely the extra-territorial scope of section 127 of the Insolvency Act 1986 and its application to the shares. The combined effect of sections 127 and 436 of the Insolvency Act 1986 is that the avoidance provisions of section 127 apply to property \\"wherever situated\\".Akers v Samba (SC), at para 96. He expanded that \\"For the reasons given by Lord Mance, I do not consider that there was any \\"disposition\\" of SICL's property\\" and so \\"It follows that the scope and effect of the Hague Convention do not fall to be decided.\\"Akers v Samba (SC), at para 98-99. Finally he added that there \\"has never been any suggestion in the authorities that an effective declaration of trust could not be made over shares in a company incorporated, or shares registered, in a country which does not recognise the trust concept. Attorney General v Jewish Colonisation Association [1901] 1 QB 123 and Duke of Marlborough v Attorney General [1945] Ch 78 are only indirect authority, but they have been, correctly, regarded as recognising English trusts over foreign shares irrespective of whether the place of incorporation or place of registration recognises the trust concept.\\"Akers v Samba (SC), at para 102. Although those comments were not germaine to the decision, Lord Collins felt that those comments were worth making given the importance of the underlying subject matter. Reception The decision of the Supreme Court was handed down after the most recent edition of Dicey Morris & Collins (the 15th, published in 2012). But in their 2018 annual supplement, the editors cited the decision with approval in relation to a number of statements of law, including (1) the principle that it is possible to have a trust over property (in that case, shares) located in a jurisdiction which does not have or recognise the concept of a trust, (2) the question of whether the transfer had overridden the beneficiary‚Äôs trust rights was determined by the lex situs, and (3) where a settlor had purported to declare himself trustee of shares located in Saudi Arabia pursuant to certain Cayman law trusts and then transferred those shares to a party in Saudi Arabia, Saudi law would determine whether the effect of the transfer was to defeat the beneficiary‚Äôs trust rights; but this conclusion should be reached by the application of Article 11(3)(d) of the Hague Trust Convention and not pursuant to the Article 15(1). Similarly, the Supreme Court's ruling post-dated the most recent edition of Cheshire North & Fawcett (15th edition, 2017). But the editors cite the decision of the Court of Appeal with approval, but without specifically referring to the details of the decision. But in a separate article in Trusts & Trustees, Daniel Harris called the decision \\"hard to digest\\". Clarkson & Hill do not refer to the decision at all in their most recent edition (5th, published in 2016). Subsequent decisions Akers v Samba has not yet been cited authoritatively in any subsequent judicial decisions.

He was a founder member of the Communist Party, but was among those excluded from it in 1931 after openly opposing the leadership's adoption of Stalin's \\"social fascism\\" doctrine. After the war he returned to the Social Democratic Party with which he had broken over its support for the war back in 1917. He remained active in city politics till he was well into his 70s, by which time he had become known to Berliners as \\"Papa Raddatz\\".  Life = Provenance and early years  Erich Raddatz was born into a Protestant family in Konikow (as the village of Konikowo was known at that time) in the coastal county of K√∂slin, roughly halfway between Stettin and Danzig. He completed an apprenticeship as a skilled metal worker and, while still relatively young, came to Berlin. He joined the trades union in 1907 and in 1910 became a member of the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD).  War and opposition to it  Raddatz participated in the First World War, serving as a soldier between 1916 and 1918. The decision by the SPD leadership to support war funding in a Reichstag (German parliament) vote in 1914 had been controversial with party members from the outset and set a pattern which persisted through the four years of the war. As the slaughter of war increased and austerity on the home front intensified anti-war sentiment in Germany grew ever stronger, especially on the political left. In 1917 the SPD split over the issue. Erich Raddatz was one of those who moved across to the breakaway Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD). It was as a USPD member that he took work as a local government official in the city district of Berlin-Neuk√∂lln, subsequently promoted to the position of \\"welfare inspector\\" (\\"Stadtinspektor im F√ºrsorgewesen\\").  Communist party official  In the revolutionary turmoil of 1918/1919 the USPD in its turn broke apart, with a majority of members drawing inspiration from Russia's at this stage widely celebrated October Revolution and joining Germany's own recently launched Communist Party. In 1920 Erich Raddatz switched his own party allegiance, serving as a Communist member of the local council for Neuk√∂lln between 1920 and 1925. He continued to sit on the Neuk√∂lln council between 1926 and 1930, but now in an unpaid capacity. Between 1928 and 1932 he also served as a member of the \\"Magistrat\\" which under the terms of the 1920 \\"Greater Berlin Law\\" was a municipal executive body with (limited) powers and responsibilities covering the entire city. Jedermanns Lexikon in zehn B√§nden. Erster Band. Verlagsanstalt Hermann Klemm A.-G., Berlin-Grunewald 1929, p. 342.  Prussian parliament  In 1928 Wilhelm Pieck, already a leading figure in the Communist Party, gave up his seat in the Prussian parliament (\\"Landtag\\"), having been elected to the German parliament (\\"Reichstag\\") in May's general election. In June 1928 Raddatz was selected to take over the Landtag seat vacated by his party comrade, representing a Potsdam electoral district (\\"Wahlkreis 3\\"). In the course party ructions during 1930/31 Raddatz was excluded from the party. He nevertheless continued to sit as a member of the Landtag till the 1932 state election.  Group of 60  The 1929 Wall Street crash heralded an economic depression which hit the German economy badly. As unemployment surged, politics became ever more polarised. Within the Communist Party, opinions were sharply divided between those who saw the populist National Socialist party under Adolf Hitler as the principal political danger to the party and the country, and those - taking their lead from Moscow - who insisted that the greater danger came from the centre-left Social Democratic Party, because it represented a more potent roadblock along the route to the dictatorship of the proletariat. The party leader, Ernst Th√§lmann, and those comrades with whom he had surrounded himself in positions of leadership in the party central committee since 1925, were unwavering in their view that the greater danger lay in attempting to reach any sort of accommodation with the Social Democrats. After 1933 commentators would increasingly express the view that Th√§lmann had badly underestimated the seductive populist skills of Adolf Hitler. Three years before that, on 28 February 1930, a group of 60 Berlin party activists and officials addressed an open letter to Th√§lmann in which they criticised the leadership's favoured \\"social fascism\\" doctrine. The \\"Group of 60\\" were immediately excluded from the party, becoming in effect a group of 60 independent Berlin communists. The Berlin city councillor Hermann Letz and Erich Raddatz found themselves the de facto co-leaders of the group. They lost no time in issuing their own newsletter. It quickly became apparent, however, that there could be no political future for a group of 60 party activists independent of a resolutely extremist Communist Party, and with no alternative political home. On 26 February 1931 the SPD party newspaper, Vorw√§rts, reported that \\"30 former communists [including Erich Raddatz] are joining the Social Democratic Party\\". Raddatz now devoted his considerable political energies to canvassing trades unionist comrades still in the Communist Party, urging them to switch away from the ever more inflexible party which, in the eyes of many, was by this time taking all its orders from Moscow.  12 years under Hitler  Regime change arrived in January 1933 and was followed by a rapid transformation of Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Political involvement as a Communist or Social Democrat was outlawed. The security services were particularly unstinting in their surveillance of those with any record of involvement with the now illegal Communist Party. Raddetz lost his job with the Berlin city council and fell back on his factory training and skills, working as a clerk in a metals processing factory in Berlin-Lichtenberg, and promoted later to a job as a foreman-supervisor. There is no mention in sources of any political activity or engagement by Erich Raddatz during the twelve Hitler years.  New beginnings  War ended in May 1945, and with it the one-party Hitler dictatorship. Raddatz re-joined the re-emerging SPD in June 1945 and was appointed to lead the social affairs department for Berlin-Neuk√∂lln. The western two thirds of Germany were now divided into four military zones of occupation. For Berlin, set in the middle of the Soviet occupation zone, separate arrangements had been agreed between the allied leaders, although many practical decisions over how the city would be administered had been left ambiguous, reflecting the inability of the so-called \\"Big Three\\" to agree the details between themselves. Berlin was divided into four sectors, each under the military administration of one or other of the victorious powers. Neuk√∂lln was in the American zone, and in November 1945 the American military administration confirmed Raddatz in his post as \\"Bezirksstadtrat\\" (loosely, \\"District city councillor\\") for social affairs. He would continue to hold the job through a succession of political reconfigurations, till his retirement in January 1959.  A \\"new\\" party  In April 1946 a contentious merger took place between the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party. It is possible that the architects of the merger intended or hoped that it would take effect in all four occupation zones. In the event it only ever took effect, with full backing from the military administration, in Germany's Soviet occupation zone. Berlin, as in so much else during this period, was an exception in various ways. In the longer term the party merger would only endure in the eastern sector of the city, which was contiguous with, and to the extent possible administered after 1945 as part of, the Soviet zone. Justification for the merger came from a widespread consciousness that the divisions on the political left during the early 1930s had opened the way for National Socialism to triumph in 1933. The product of the merger was the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED) which, if only within the Soviet zone, rapidly became the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship, closely modelled on the Leninist structure devised for the Soviet Union. Across the Soviet zone hundreds of thousands of Communists and a large number of Social Democrats rushed to sign their party memberships across to the SED. In Berlin's three western sectors enthusiasm for the party merger among Social Democrats was more muted. Many, even in 1946, suspected that the SED might somehow become a vehicle for Soviet imperialist ambitions. But among those who had campaigned most strongly during the early 1930s - in the teeth of opposition emanating from the Soviet Union - for closer collaboration between Communists and Social Democrats there were, even in the American, British and French sectors of Berlin, those who swallowed their doubts and signed their political allegiance across from the SPD to the new party. Erich Raddatz was one of these. By 20 October 1946 his name was included on the list of SED candidates in local council elections for Neuk√∂lln. He succeeded in being elected, and retained his post as \\"Bezirksstadtrat\\", no longer simply through nomination, but now endorsed in the election. In the immediate postwar period it was possible to believe that the division of Germany into four separately administered zones might be a relatively short term expedient. After 1948 it became harder to believe in German reunification as a practical proposition. The events leading up to the 1948 Berlin Blockade made it clear that reunification on Soviet terms could never be acceptable to the United States and reunification on western terms could never be acceptable to the Soviet Union. Through the 1950s cold war tensions grew, leaving Germany with one of the most technically sophisticated and deadly borders in the world, not on its outer edge, but down its middle. In August 1948 Erich Raddatz left the SED and returned, again, to the Social Democratic Party. Over the next few years he found himself singled out for media criticism from East German media, but his popularity in his West Berlin home base seems not to have suffered from his record of sometimes choosing the \\"wrong\\" party. By the time of his retirement from his council duties in 1959 he was becoming known by the affectionate soubriquet \\"Papa Raddatz\\", or even \\"Opa {Grandpa} Raddatz\\". Along with his social affairs portfolio as \\"Bezirksstadtrat\\", between 1955 and 1959 he also served as deputy mayor of Neuk√∂lln.  Final years  Raddatz lived on another five years after his retirement, during which time he served as a \\"hands-on\\" regional vice president for the Berlin AWO (\\"Workers' Welfare\\") association. Following a serious operation, he died in West Berlin on 16 February 1964.

It will associate with browsing herbivorous fishes, hiding amongst them and feeding on the hidden animals disturbed by these fish as they browse. They have also been recorded following moray eels as they forage, preying on fishes fleeing from the eel. This species forms schools and synchronized spawning aggregations made up of around 30 to 70 fishes. Spawning aggregations have been observed from late November until February over a seamount off Cocos Island. They have also been observed spawning at Manuelita Island close to Cocos Island in late July. In the Revillagigedo Islands of Mexico spawning aggregations of 30-54 individuals have been recorded in February over a shallow seamount. Taxonomy Dermatolepis dermatolepis was originally described as Dermatolepis punctatus by the American ichthyologist Theodore Nicholas Gill (1837-1914) as the type species of the monotypic subgenus Dermatolepis of the genus Epinephelus with the type locality given as Cape San Lucas, Baja California in Mexico. This name was preoccupied by Holocentrus punctatus, a possible synonym of Epinephelus guttatus.

He was also prominent in the development and initiation of the Sydney Opera House as Chairman of the Opera House Executive Committee and the Sydney Opera House Trust from 1954 to 1969. Early life and career Haviland married Florence Nunn at the Glen Innes Methodist Church in 1920 (now Chapel Theatre).Stanley Haviland was born on 13 April 1899 at Kogarah in the Colony of New South Wales, the fourth son of Cecil Henry Haviland (1861‚Äì1943), clerk (later Victualling Officer for HM Australian Naval Establishments, Sydney, 1913‚Äì1923), and Emily Hannah Shaw (1862‚Äì1937). After education at Cleveland Street Superior School, Haviland joined the New South Wales Public Service when he was appointed a junior clerk in the Department of Lands on 13 April 1915. In 1920 he was appointed a Clerk in the Returned Soldiers' Settlement Branch of the Department of Lands. On 16 November 1920, Haviland was married to Florence Mary Nunn at the Methodist Church, Glen Innes, by the Rev. H. W. Woodhouse. Following a honeymoon at Terrigal, the Havilands moved to the Sydney suburb of Bexley. On 26 August 1921 a son, Innes Stanley Haviland, was born at their Bexley residence, 'Lindisfarne' on Glenfarne Street. Public service career=Local Government On 1 May 1931, Haviland left the Lands Department and was appointed as a First Clerk of the Department of Local Government. On 1 February 1936 the Department of Public Works and the Department of Local Government were amalgamated as the Department of Works and Local Government and Haviland was further promoted as a Special Officer and Secretary to the Local Government Examination Committees from the same date. However, on 1 November 1936 Haviland was further promoted to the senior position of Assistant Under Secretary of the department. On his appointment to this position, the Municipality of Bexley sent a letter of congratulations. When the department underwent a reshuffle in 1941, with Local Government being moved to the new Department of Local Government and Housing, Haviland retained his post as Assistant Under Secretary from 2 June 1941. On 20 June 1945, Haviland was appointed by the Minister for Local Government, Joseph Cahill, as a commissioner on the Clancy Royal Commission on Local Government Boundaries charged with investigating whether the boundaries of the City of Sydney should be extended and which areas should be amalgamated, and whether any other areas in the County of Cumberland be united, divided or otherwise altered and reconstituted as a municipality or shire. The final report of the Royal Commission initially recommended much more ambitious targets for amalgamations, including a City of Sydney that included all councils from Ashfield and Marrickville to Botany, Randwick and Vaucluse and north to include North Sydney and Mosman. A minority report authored by the third commissioner, Ronald Storey, the Mayor of Drummoyne, recommended reducing 66 councils to 34, a more modest target compared to the majority's recommendation of 66 to 18. A more ambitious plan to create eight new cities in the County of Cumberland (known as the \\"Eight Cities Plan\\"), was progressed by Haviland, and was seriously considered by state cabinet following the release of the commission's report in mid-1946. This plan, however, met with significant opposition from local government circles and the cabinet eventually decided in July 1947 on a plan for legislation to follow the first recommendation of reducing 66 councils to 14. With the retirement of the Under Secretary of the department, Henry Eastwood Street, in June 1946, Haviland became Acting Under Secretary from 1 July 1946 and succeeded him as substantive Under Secretary for Local Government on Street's full retirement from 5 October 1946. In 1951 and 1954 respectively he chaired the committees charged with organising Commonwealth of Australia Jubilee and with the royal visit. In the 1957 New Year Honours he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his work as the head of the Department of Local Government. Sydney Opera House The Sydney Opera House under construction in 1966. Haviland led the committees directing the design, location and development of the Opera House project from 1954 to 1969.In late 1954, Premier Joseph Cahill appointed Haviland to serve as Chairman of the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee, with the responsibility to investigate suggestions for its location and design. The Committee eventually considered 14 proposed sites for an Opera House, including Fort Macquarie (Bennelong Point), the issue of public subscription to fund the Opera House, and the design competition, which was won by J√∏rn Utzon. On 14 March 1961 Haviland's committee that had overseen the launch of the opera house project was tranformed into the Sydney Opera House Trust by the Sydney Opera Trust Act, 1961, with Haviland appointed as the Chairman. Haviland was a strong supporter of the choice of Utzon and his design, and defended him in July 1962 in response to criticisms of Utzon's regular changes and tweaks to his design in the construction stage: \\"Most criticisms seem to have overlooked the subtle excellence of Mr Utzon's imaginative and comprehensive conceptions so widely acclaimed in 1957, and the necessity to reconcile an extraordinarily wide variety of requirement with a scholarly flexibility of design. The Opera House itself commands admiration throughout the world and it will be a source of great pride to the citizens of Sydney particularly.\\" Under Haviland's direction, the new trust supervised the remaining construction of the opera house including following the resignation of Utzon in 1966, and he would serve until the enactment of the Sydney Opera House Trust (Amendment) Act, 1969 on 1 May 1969. Sydney Water Board Haviland also served on the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board, serving as Vice-President from 1955 to 1960. When Haviland retired from his position as Under Secretary for Local Government in September 1960, as a gesture of the esteem with which he was held by the local governments across the state, he was presented with a testimonial fund and an official presentation containing messages of goodwill from over 200 shire, municipal and county councils at the Local Government Conference at Orange on 25 October 1960. When the President of the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board, John Goodsell was appointed to Chair the Public Service Board, Haviland was appointed to serve from 23 September 1960 as President of the board. His term of office was noted for having \\"promoted staff relations, eased formality, and was involved in improving and beautifying picnic areas at the board's dams.\\" Haviland was responsible for the development of public facilities and picnic areas in the former construction zone around Warragamba Dam when it was completed in 1960. When Haviland retired from the Board, the main picnic area and park was subsequently named in his honour in December 1965 as 'Haviland Park', which is now listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register. Later career and legacy When his term as President of the water board ended on 22 September 1965, Haviland did not go into quiet retirement and had been appointed on 25 August 1965 to serve as a member of the Royal Commission of inquiry into rating, valuation and local government finance, chaired by Justice Rae Else- Mitchell. The commissioned reported in 1967, with its main recommendation to establish the Local Government Grants Commission accepted by the government of Robert Askin. Haviland was a member of the State councils of the Royal Institute of Public Administration and the National Trust of Australia, the board of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust (1956‚Äì1970), the Australian Museum Trust (1960‚Äì1970) and the Royal National Park trust. He was also an active Rotarian (1948‚Äì1972) and the president of the St George area of the Boy Scouts' Association (1958‚Äì1971). Ten months after the death of his wife, Haviland died on 2 June 1972 at his Kingsgrove home and was cremated. He was buried at Woronora Memorial Park alongside his wife, mother and father, and paternal grandparents. On his death the Sydney Morning Herald noted that he was a \\"dedicated public servant, he believed his function was to advise the Government instead of making public statements\\". His only son, Innes Stanley Haviland, became an engineer, having graduated from the University of Sydney with a Bachelor of Engineering in 1943, and was a returned veteran who served as a lieutenant in the 23rd Field Company, Royal Australian Engineers in the New Guinea Campaign (1943‚Äì1945). Innes Haviland was later elected as an Alderman of the Municipality of North Sydney (Belmore Ward) and Mayor of North Sydney (1966‚Äì1968, 1974‚Äì1975), and was a Councillor and President of the Sydney County Council (1975‚Äì1977). He was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1976 and awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977.

His musical legacy has only been gradually reconstructed since 1990.  Life  Immisch was born in 1902 in Hermsdorf, then Saxe-Altenburg, as the son of a well-to-do family. In 1912 the Immischs moved to Bautzen. After graduating from high school he moved to the University of Jena in 1921 to study Jurisprudence and National economics at his father's request. There he began his musical education at the same time. He continued his double studies in 1922/23 at the University of Munich and at the Akademie f√ºr Tonkunst with Ernst Riemann. He finished it in Leipzig during the years 1923 to 1928 where he was taught by Carl Adolf Martienssen in artistic piano playing and piano methodology and by Hermann Grabner in music theory and musical composition. In 1926, Immisch received his doctorate in law from Leipzig University. However, he never exercised legal activity; since 1928 he devoted himself exclusively to music. His work as a concert pianist took him to several large cities in Germany, especially to Dresden, where Immisch settled in the early 1930s. He acquired a very good reputation as an intelligent interpreter of modern piano music. Later he increasingly accompanied singers and instrumental soloists, also in broadcasting. From 1936 Immisch taught at the orchestra school of the Staatskapelle Dresden and at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Carl Maria von Weber in Dresden. A scoliosis, which was caused by an accident during gymnastics lessons at the age of thirteen and which, according to his sister, Immisch had to \\"bear with difficulty throughout his life\\", saved him from a wartime deployment. However, Immisch was pressed to join the NSDAP, which he refused to do. This led to his dismissal without notice in 1943. As a result of the Bombing of Dresden in World War II he gave up the city as his sphere of activity in 1945. After the end of the war, the Dresden Academy of Music and Theater renewed the offer to appoint him as lecturer at its institute. Immisch declined because of his poor state of health. He died in January 1949, shortly after reaching the age of 46, in his home town of Bautzen.Arthur Immisch on WorldCatArthur Immisch on Ena-Musik Verlag  Work  Immisch left behind a qualitatively considerable compositional legacy, which is mainly based on chamber music works. Especially in the 50, mostly quite demanding, songs, in which his interest in contemporary authors is also evident, he reveals a remarkable mastery. Nearly half of these songs are settings of Chinese and Japanese lyrics. Influenced by French impressionism, these works certainly have an individual style. During his lifetime there was no longer any planned publication. After his death his work was soon forgotten for decades. From 1997 on, the sheet music of most of the songs, piano, and chamber music works was finally printed; many pieces were performed in concerts and some were documented on CD and DVD. Thanks to Immisch's last pupil at the Dresden Conservatory, Brigitta Lubke (1925-2004), the manuscripts of his works have been preserved.

Conan Doyle Estate, Ltd. was a 2014 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (755 F.3d 496.), in response to an appeal filed by the defendants against the 2013 ruling of the U.S. District Court for Northern district of Illinois (988 F. Supp. 2d 879). These decisions, by the district court and the court of the seventh circuit, clarified the validity (under copyright law) of use of characters of Sherlock Holmes and his colleague Dr. John Watson, and the story elements, in unlicensed works. Further, the scope of using characters, existing in public domain, was also clarified. The courts held that the characters of Holmes and Watson had entered Public domain and so had the story elements of the works on which the copyright protection had expired, i.e., published prior to 1923, and hence they can be used in subsequent works without procuring a license. However, the copyright protection in works published in and after 1923, was still valid, and the unique expressions used in those works could still not be used without the permission of the Defendants, till the time copyright expires in these works.  Background  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle authored four novels and fifty- six short stories featuring Holmes and Watson (sometimes referred to as the \\"Canon\\"), published between 1887 and 1927. The Conan Doyle Estate was a company owned by certain collateral descendants of Conan Doyle and others, which claims ownership of certain intellectual property rights to Conan Doyle's works and grants licenses to use these rights. By 2013, 50 of the 60 canonical stories were in the public domain in the United States because their copyrights had expired. The remaining 10 stories, first published in magazines and later published in book form in The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes, remained under copyright in the United States under the \\"Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998\\", which extended the copyright term for certain works published in and after 1923 to 95 years from their original publication date.U.S. Copyright Office, Circular 1: Copyright Basics, pp. 5‚Äì6. The copyrights on these 10 stories would expire on dates ranging from January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2023.Jessica L. Malekos Smith, Sherlock Holmes & the Case of the Contested Copyright, 15 Chi.-Kent J. Intell. Prop. 537 (2016). Available at: https://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/ckjip/vol15/iss2/9 Leslie S. Klinger co- edited an anthology of original Sherlock Holmes pastiches, titled A Study in Sherlock, which was published in 2011 by Random House. The stories in A study in Sherlock were inspired by the Canon and included characters and elements that were part of the Canon. Before the anthology was published, the Conan Doyle Estate asserted to Random House that the Estate had exclusive rights to use the characters of Holmes and Watson, and if Random House intended to publish the anthology, it needed to enter into a licensing agreement with the Estate. Random House signed a licensing agreement with the Estate before publishing the anthology. Klinger then co-edited a sequel to A study in Sherlock, a second anthology titled In the Company of Sherlock Holmes. This book was also a compilation of short stories inspired and influenced by the Canon. This book was to be published by Pegasus Books and distributed by W.W. Norton & Company. When the Estate learned of this book's impending publication, it contacted Pegasus Books, asserting that if Pegasus intended to publish the work legally, it needed to obtain a license from the Estate. The Estate further asserted that \\"if you proceed instead to bring out the book unlicensed, do not expect to see it offered for sale by Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and similar retailers. We work with those compan[ies] routinely to weed out unlicensed uses of Sherlock Holmes from their offerings, and will not hesitate to do so with your book as well.\\"988 F. Supp. at 3. Klinger believed that he did not need to obtain and pay for a license from the Estate, because the characters of Holmes and Watson had already entered the public domain and hence could be freely used. However, Pegasus Books was concerned about the communication it had received from the Estate and did not finalize its contract to publish the book. To address the issue, Klinger filed a copyright lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting in Chicago, against the Conan Doyle Estate. The lawsuit sought declaratory judgement under the Declaratory Judgement Act, 28 U.S.C.S. ¬ß 2201, determining that Klinger could legally publish In the Company of Sherlock Holmes without paying the Estate for a license.  District Court decision (2013)  The district court had allowed the plaintiff to file for a summary motion due to the absence of defendant in the initial proceedings. The standard, as the court noted, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure no. 56 for granting summary motion is that, \\"[t]he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of Law.\\" was complied with. The plaintiff, sought a declaratory judgement that the characters of Holmes and Watson had entered the public domain and hence could be used by the plaintiff and that he was further allowed to use the any expressions depicted in first fifty works. The district court, on the action brought by the plaintiff had two headings to decide upon- # Whether it had the jurisdiction to pass a declaratory judgement, and; # Whether on the merits of the case Klinger was allowed by the law to use the characters of Holmes and Watson and the story elements, both for- a. Pre-1923 works and b. Post-1923 works (the ten stories) The district court granted, in part, and denied, in part, the plaintiff's motion for summary judgement.  Jurisdiction  The Estate asserted that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the case because there was no \\"actual controversy\\" between the parties, as required before the court may issue a declaratory judgment, because the Estate had not threatened litigation against Klinger. Klinger disagreed, asserting that a direct threat of litigation was not the sole means by which an actual controversy could be created. Here, Klinger asserted, the Estate's assertions that publishing the book without a license would be unlawful and its threat to deter online retailers from distributing the book by using the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, were sufficient to give rise to an actual controversy. District Judge Ruben Castillo observed that the actual controversy requirement under the Declaratory Judgment Act resembled the requirements of the Case or Controversy Clause in Article III of the U.S. Constitution. He observed that in MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc.,549 U.S. 118 (2007), the Court had held that a threat of litigation was not essential for a case or controversy under Article III. Rather, the court explained, the test was \\"whether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.\\" Here, exercising the \\"unique and substantial discretion\\" accorded to the courts under the Declaratory Judgment Act,988 F. Supp. at 8. Judge Castillo found that a \\"substantial controversy\\" existed between the parties, that the parties had clear \\"adverse legal interests,\\" and that publication of the book was dependent on the court's potential ruling. Thus, the dispute had \\"sufficient immediacy and reality\\" for the court to exercise jurisdiction.  Merits  * Pre-1923 - The court stated that for Pre-1923 works, Klinger need not to obtain any license, since they already had entered the public domain. Citing Silverman v. CBC, Inc.870 F.2d 40, 50 (2d Cir. 1989)., where some of the radio scripts had entered in public domain while some others were still protected, the plaintiff was allowed to use public domain material without any license. The estate however argued that the characters of Holmes and Watson continued to get developed through the complete Canon, including in the ten stories, and therefore, they should remain under copyright protection till the final work gets into public domain. The court again using the Silverman case as a reference point, noted that only to the extent that the ten stories further delineated the characters, they would be protected by the copyright, i.e., only the \\"increments of expression\\" added by the ten stories are protected.988 F. Supp. at 13. The defendant also argued that the reference taken from Silverman should only be limited to flat characters and not complex characters such as Holmes and Watson. However, the court held that the argument made by the Estate is without any legal basis and further observed that, \\"\\"[T]he copyrightable aspects of a character . . . are protected only to the extent the work in which that particular aspect of the character was first delineated remains protected.\\"Gaiman v. McFarlene, 360 F.3d 644,660 (7th Cir. 2004). The court held that if the argument offered by the defendant is held to be the law, it would essentially mean into extension of the statutory duration of protection and that would be against the objectives of Copyright Act. * Post-1923 - Klinger argued that even the elements present in ten stories shouldn't be protected, since they do no complete the characters, and those elements are events rather than the characteristics of Holmes and Watson. Justice Castillo, rejecting the argument held that the test is not whether elements complete the characters or not, but that of \\"increment in expression\\". To the extent that an author of a derivative work, contributes to the increment of expression, copyright protected is to be granted to the underlying work.17 U.S.C. ¬ß 103(b) The estate, argued that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle developed the characters throughout the canon and therefore, no single work is a derivative work of another. Court rejected this interpretation. 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 101, defines derivative works as, \\"A ‚Äúderivative work‚Äù is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgement, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a ‚Äúderivative work‚Äù. Interpreting and adopting the definition, the court held that the ten stories are indeed derivative works of the earlier works, but, that doesn't affect their copyright protection, since they satisfy the increment in expression test. *  Court of Appeals decision (2014)  Dissatisfied with the decision of district court, the Estate filed an appeal to the court of the Seventh Circuit. The Appeal court, had two counts to decide upon- # Whether the District court had a valid jurisdiction to pass a ruling in the case, and; # Whether the ruling by the district court with respect to the use of characters of Holmes and Watson and story elements was correct under the law.  Jurisdiction  Article III of the constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to cases or controversies. Thus, only when there is an \\"actual dispute\\", a federal court should exercise its jurisdiction. That requirement, the appeal court held, was fulfilled. As noted here- \\"Had Klinger had no idea how the Doyle estate would react to the publication of In the Company of Sherlock Holmes, he could not have sought a declaratory judgment, because he would not have been able to demonstrate that there was an actual dispute. He could seek advice, but not from a federal judge. But the Doyle estate had made clear that if Klinger succeeded in getting his book published the estate would try to prevent it from being sold by asking Amazon and the other big book retailers not to carry it, implicitly threatening to sue the publisher, as well as Klinger and his co-editor, for copyright infringement if they defied its threat. The twin threats‚Äîto block the distribution of the book by major retailers and to sue for copyright infringement‚Äîcreated an actual rather than merely a potential controversy.\\"755 F.3d. at 5., Justice Posner noted, \\"Only if Klinger obtains the declaration will he be able to publish his book without having to yield to what he considers extortion.\\" The court noted that had Klinger published the sequel, without seeking the declaratory order, he would've faced a copyright infringement suit form the Estate. Further, it was held, that the action brought by the plaintiff was purely a matter of law, i.e., whether he can use the character of Holmes and Watson, and elements in public domain, and accordingly the Judge in the Federal Court was right to assert jurisdiction over the case. Interestingly, it was also noted by the court that for post-1923 works, plaintiff did not intend to seek a declaratory judgement, since he acknowledged that the copyrights in the ten stories were valid, and the district court only discussed them due to mislabeling of certain exhibits.755 F.3d. at 7. Accordingly, the Appeal court held that the summary judgement ruling for the last ten stories can be ignored.  Validity of copyright protection  The Estate contended that the character cannot be lawfully used without a license, until the copyright in the later works, where the character of Holmes and Watson were depicted differently, subsides. The court ruled this assertion without having any basis under the law or the copyright statute. Reiterating the decision in Silverman, Justice Posner, noted that, copyright subsists in only the original work of authorship, and afterwards, only till the extent of increment in expression in the subsequent/derivative works. Upholding the ruling of district court, the court noted that the ten stories are derivative works, inspired from earlier stories, and hence only the original elements in the ten stories remain protected. The Estate contended that there is a distinction between \\"flat\\" and \\"round\\" characters (earlier in the district court they did not use the term \\"round\\" but \\"complex\\"), and the ruling of the district court along with the cited precedents should only be limited to the flat characters. That is to say that as far as characters of Holmes and Watson are in question, the ten stories make their character more \\"rounded\\" in nature and thus, warranting copyright protection over them. The court, noted that essentially, flat characters don't evolve further than work they first appeared in, but round characters do, but what this distinction had to do with law \\"eludes\\"755 F.3d. at 12. the court. The court draws an analogy to Star Wars, observing- \\"A contemporary example is the six Star Wars movies: Episodes IV, V, and VI were produced before I, II, and III. The Doyle estate would presumably argue that the copyrights on the characters as portrayed in IV, V, and VI will not expire until the copyrights on I, II, and III expire\\", Justice Posner observes. The court, finally states that in the initial works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the characters of Holmes and Watson, were sufficiently delineated,Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp., 45 F.2d 119, 121 (2d Cir. 1930) as to become eligible and subject to copyright protection. Any subsequent alteration to these characters made in the ten stories, even though independently original and subject to protection, does not \\"revive the expired copyrights on the original characters.\\"755 F.3d at 13. The court rejecting the appeal of the defendants observed that the Estate is essentially asking for a 135 years of copyright protection over the characters of Holmes and Watson, which was contradictory to the goals of the statute and hence not permissible under the law.  Supreme Court proceedings  Dissatisfied with the Seventh Circuit's decision, the Estate requested an emergency stay from the Circuit Justice for the Seventh Circuit, Justice Elena Kagan, who denied the application. The Estate then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which was also denied, leaving the Seventh Circuit's opinion as the final judgment in the case.Memorandum from the United States Supreme Court Office of the Clerk for Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Conan Doyle Estate, Ltd. v. Leslie S. Klinger, Nov. 3, 2014, https://freesherlock.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/klinger-supreme-court-minute- orderdenying-+cert-c.pd  Implications  There are many characters which appear in more than one works. Some of these works may be in under protection whereas some others might have entered into public domain. The ruling in Klinger v. Conan Doyle Estate Ltd., allows the subsequent authors to use the characters and expressions in the works which have entered into public domain. Thus, a character, which has been modified in subsequent works, does not get a perpetual copyright. So the protection is not infinite under the law, which could've been the case, if the court had passed a judgement in defendant's favour. The copyright protection in subsequent works is only limited to the original contributions, which the court identifies as increment of expression, and does not extends the protection of character which appeared in original work. More importantly, though the works in public domain, and their elements (which were earlier protected) can be used in subsequent or derivative works, the said derivative works would still have to comply with the conditions of originality (Feist), in order to get copyright protection. As the Seventh Circuit Court noted in Schrock v. Learning Curve International, Inc.,586 F.3d 513, 518 (7th Cir. 2009) \\"\\"the only originality required for a new work to be copyrightable is enough expressive variation from public-domain or other existing works to enable the new work to be readily distinguished from its predecessors.\\", still needs to be complied with in order to warrant copyright protection in derivative works which use the characters appearing in earlier works.

Early life Ruth Elizabeth Clement was born in Louisville, Kentucky on 22 May 1904, to George Clinton Clement, a bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and Emma Clarissa Williams Clement. She was the fourth of seven children. She attended Livingstone College (of which both her parents were graduates), but earned both her bachelors' and masters' degrees in English from Northwestern University. From 1930 to 1932, she was chair of the English department at Kentucky State College. Career and family In 1931, she married Dr. J. Max Bond Sr., and they moved to Los Angeles shortly after; he attended the University of Southern California (receiving his doctorate in sociology in 1936). Together, they had three children: historian Jane Bond Howard, architect J. Max Bond Jr., and anthropologist George Clement Bond. Their nephew was Julian Bond, organizer of the SNCC. From 1934‚Äì1938, J. Max Bond Sr. served as the Director of Negro Personnel and Education with the Tennessee Valley Authority. During this time, Ruth worked with a home beautification project to decorate the homes of Black construction workers working to build the Wheeler Dam in Alabama. She designed a series of striking patterns for art quilts that were then made by the wives of the workers. Though this was her first and only foray into quilting, her striking modern patterns are remembered as a significant innovation in quilt art, helping move quilt design \\"from the practical to the artistic realm.\\" They departed from the floral and geometric patterns common in quilt design, depicting silhouettes of Black workers, in a \\"jagged yet elegant\\" style reminiscent of Henri Matisse's paper cutouts and Aaron Douglas's paintings. The first quilt was called \\"Black Power\\". In Ruth's own words: \\"That was a pun, of course, TVA being about power. The first quilt showed a bolt of lightning signifying power, held in the hand of a black worker.\\" Altogether, they designed and constructed six quilts, known as the \\"T.V.A. quilts\\", of which three are remaining; they have been exhibited at the Museum of Arts and Design and the Michigan State University Museum, among others. In 1944, Max accepted a role with the United States Department of State, and the Bonds travelled to Haiti, where Ruth served on the faculty of L'Ecole Normale de Martissant. In 1950, they were posted to Liberia, where Max would serve as the president of the University of Liberia, and Ruth headed the University's English department. In the 1950s and early 1960s, they were posted to Afghanistan, Tunisia, Sierra Leone, and Nyasaland. Later life Following Max's retirement in 1966, the Bonds returned to the United States and took up residence in Washington, D.C., where they both became involved with community issues. During the 1960s, Ruth served as the president of the African-American Women's Association. In 1978, she worked with a fact-finding mission led by the National Council of Negro Women to study the role of women in Senegal, Togo, and the Ivory Coast. Both the Bonds were involved with the Africa-America Institute, founded by Max's brother Horace Mann Bond. In D.C., Ruth was on the boards of the Boys and Girls Club of Washington, the YMCA, and the Red Cross, and was an active member of the Foreign Service Women's Association.

He was also a cinematographer and fashion designer. Early life He was partly of Italian ancestry, and his family had included many artists. His great-grandfather, Alessandro Angelo, the creator of the frescoes at the Hofburg in Vienna, and also, reputedly, designed sets for Gioachino Rossini. The artist members of the family adopted the artist name ‚ÄúAngelo‚Äù in honor of their famous predecessor. Pal Funk began to take photographs at ten, but his arts studies were not limited to photography: in 1910 he attended Carl Bauer's painting school in Munich and then the Peters photography studio in Hamburg, the D√ºhrkopp-studio in Berlin, in the studios of Rudolf D√ºhrkoop and Nicola Perscheidin Berlin, with L√©opold- √âmile Reutlinger in Paris, with Marcus Adams and with E. O. Hopp√© in London. He returned home from France in 1914 and then spent four years in the Army during the First World War. His wife, Anna Misley, was a dancer at the Opera House. Career Returning home, he began working in the studio of Alad√°r Sz√©kely in Budapest as a first assistant, and after a few unsuccessful attempts, he opened his first studio in 1919 at 14 Vilmos cs√°sz√°r √∫t. From 1920 to 1946 his studio was located at Budapest, IV. V√°ci St. Not long after, he was photographing again in Paris and Nice, and then, until 1938, worked in Paris and Amsterdam, in temporary studios. Among the names he used internationally are P. F. Angelo, Angelo P√°l, Paul Angelo, Funk P√°l, and Funk Pink√°sz. In 1923 he also worked in Paris as a fashion- and costume-designer. Between the wars, his work appeared in magazines such as Vanity Fair, Harper‚Äòs Bazaar, Cin√©ma, Die Dame, Berliner Leben, Berliner Zeitung Illustrirte. In 1926 he was made a member of the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain. Amongst those he photographed were Charlie Chaplin, Serge Lifar, Josephine Baker, Vaslav Nijinsky, Isadora Duncan, Pablo Picasso and B√©la Bart√≥k. On the pedagogical side, he gave more than seventy lectures on Hungarian photography, the aesthetics of modern photography, and portrait and nude photography. He was also the chairman of the Master of Photographers Examination Committee. Between 1927 and 1937 he wrote dozens of articles for Fot√≥m≈±v√©szeti H√≠rek (Photography News journal) and from 1934 to 1938 he was one of the editors of the journal Magyar Fotogr√°fia (Hungarian Photography). During World War II, he was detained by the Gestapo due to his Jewish origins, however, he luckily managed to escape the fate of many other Hungarian Jews. Filmmaking He first became involved in film-making during WW1, working with Mih√°ly Kert√©sz (Michael Curtiz) from 1916, and then spent several months a year on the filming of Franco-British Film Co.. He has also worked for Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer, with such big-name artists as Rex Ingram, Erich Pommer, Fritz Lang, Alexander Wolkoff, Ernst Lubitsch and Harry Lachman. According to some sources, he shot the first Hungarian sound film. He was also involved in the filming of the first commercial film, in 1927. The cameraman was Istv√°n Eiben. According to some sources, he worked regularly with motion pictures for seven, others for more than ten years. Post-WW2 career In 1945, he launched the Angelo Fot√≥ Akad√©mi√°t (Angelo Photography Academy), to which he sought to invite renowned photographers as tutors. In addition to studio photography, he was also significantly involved in the establishment and operation of professional organizations. After the Second World War, he took part in the operation of the association of Hungarian amateur photographers, MADOME, and in 1956 he was also a founding member of the Association of Hungarian Photographers. His studio was nationalized in 1951, and from then on he worked as a simple skilled worker, a member of the Budapesti F√©nyk√©p√©sz Kisipari Termel≈ë Sz√∂vetkezet (Budapest Photographer's Small-Scale Production Cooperative) ‚Äì however in the same premises as his studio. Angelo tried to meet the expectations of the age, he became a stakhanovite of the cooperative, photographing an estimated 450,000 people during his career. In addition to his work for the cooperative, he photographed more and more for his own pleasure, to satisfy his artistic inclinations. His late images have no living figures, his pictorial world had become surreal and alien. Retrospectives * Seelenverwandt.

A Republican, among the offices in which he served were Associate Justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court (1873-1877), Judge of the International Tribunal in Alexandria, Egypt (1878-1880), and Minister to Mexico (1880-1885). Biography Philip Hicky Morgan (sometimes spelled \\"Hickey\\" was born in Baton Rouge on August 9, 1825, a son of Thomas Gibbes (sometimes spelled \\"Gibbs\\") Morgan and the former Eliza Ann McKennan. He was named for Colonel Philip Hicky, a Louisiana plantation owner and friend of his father. He was educated locally and then attended the University of Paris in France from 1841 to 1846.

This occurs in cases of severe cerebral edema, such as by cerebral hypoxia. It may also occur due to intrathecally administered contrast material, leakage of high-dose intravenous contrast material into the subarachnoid spaces, or in patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, severe meningitis, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, intracranial hypotension, cerebellar infarctions, or bilateral subdural hematomas. In a true subarachnoid hemorrhage, there is higher attenuation of the basal cisterns, and blood that has leaked from a vessel or formed a hematoma is more highly attenuated due to the absorption of plasma. Pseudosubarachnoid hemorrhages have been observed in as much as 20% of patients resuscitated from non-traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest. Patients with pseudosubarachnoid hemorrhages may have worse prognoses than those with true subarachnoid hemorrhages because of underlying disease processes and decreased cerebral perfusion with elevated intracranial pressure. The identification of a pseudosubarachnoid hemorrhage as opposed to a true subarachnoid hemorrhage may therefore change a patient's treatment plan.

The case involved a claim of copyright infringement brought forth against the pop star Madonna, for sampling the horns from an early 1980s song Ooh I Love It (Love Break) by the Salsoul Orchestra in her international hit song Vogue. Such sampling was done without a license, or compensation to VMG Salsoul, LLC who was the copyright holder of Love Break and therefore moved the court claiming infringement and damages. The Ninth Circuit was to rule upon a contentious issue in the music industry at large, i.e. whether the de minimis defense is applicable against a claim of copyright infringement in the case of sound recording, with special regard to the practice of sampling.Ryan Beck, Creativity or Copyright Ingringement?: Evaluating the De Minimis Exception in Digital Sampling through VMG Salsoul, LLC and Bridgeport Music, Inc., 70 Rutgers University Law Review 521 The issue was brought before a federal judge, with the plaintiff claiming that both, a single horn hit and a double horn hit had been copied from their work without license. However, the federal court ruled in favor of the Defendants, accepting their defense under the de minimis doctrine, wherein they said only a minimal and insubstantial part of the original work had been copied in the new work. Subsequently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed the federal courts decision and reinstated the de minimis defense in the case of sound recordings. This defense had effectively been eliminated by the judgement given in Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit which established a bright line licensing regime with regards to samples which held that license must be taken regardless of duration or substantiality of sample.Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films, 410 F.3d 792, 800-01 (6th Cir. 2005). The Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit also relied on the decision given by the same court in Newton v. Diamond, 388 F.3d 1189, 1190 (9th Cir. 2003) which held de minimis as a valid defense in claims of infringement in sound recordings and to determine whether use was de minimis it must be considered whether an average audience would recognize appropriation from original work as present in the accused work.  The court's decision = Majority opinion  In its summary review of the federal court judgement, the Ninth Circuit gave its decision on the assumption that copying of the horn hit had been done as the Plaintiff had submitted sufficient evidence, including anecdotal evidence, to necessitate this inference. However, this was not enough to conclusively prove infringement had occurred as the Court required evidence that such copying was 'substantial' in nature. Therefore, in the majority decision favoring the Defendants the Ninth Circuit held that:- # The horn hit used in Vogue was insubstantial enough so as to be considered de minimis # The de minimis doctrine is a valid defense to claims of copyright infringement in the case of sound recordings and has not been eliminated by Congress as held in the Bridgeport Music Case.VMG Salsoul, L.L.C. v. Ciccone, 824 F.3d 871, 877-78 (9th Cir. 2016) In considering whether the sample of the horn hit used was substantial or not, the Ninth Circuit used the facts of Newton as reference. In that case, the Beastie Boys used a six-second sample from the original work and looped it throughout the entirety of their new work, the single 'Sure Shot', with the sample appearing over forty times in their rendition of the song. Despite this the Ninth Circuit in its judgement rejected the claims of infringement on the grounds that an average audience would not be able to 'discern the role played by the plaintiff in the new song as the hand of a composer.' and held such usage insubstantial.Newton v. Diamond, 388 F.3d 1189, 1191 (9th Cir. 2004). On the other hand, in this case, the duration of the sample used is no more than 0.23 seconds, and only appears intermittently throughout the song rather than serving as the bedrock of the composition. Therefore, it is only logical that the sample of the horn hit be held as insubstantial in this case too as it is of lesser duration, frequency and prominence in the new work vis-a-vis the fact scenario in Newton where it was held to be insubstantial and meeting the criteria of a de minimis defense too. The Ninth Circuit also gave its reason for going against the holding of the Bridgeport Music Case, and why it found the rationale behind its holding unpersuasive. It stated that the Sixth Circuit's reasoning for stating that the de minimis defense has been eliminated by Congress is based on a faulty interpretation of a portion of 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 114 which states, \\"The exclusive rights of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clauses (1) and (2) of section 106 do not extend to the making or duplication of another sound recording that consists entirely of an independent fixation of other sounds, even though such sounds imitate or simulate those in the copyrighted sound recording.\\"17 U.S.C. ¬ß 114(b) The Ninth Circuit noted that the purpose of this provision is to limit the rights of the copyright holder, as it promotes creativity by allowing new artists the right to interpolation, rather than expand it, as has been the result of the Sixth Circuits interpretation. It also points out that this provision states that mimicking of the sound in a new and original recording is allowed by this provision, even if it is very well done, but nowhere does it speak of eliminating the de minimis defense in the case of sound recordings as has been the inference drawn by the Sixth Circuit. To further reinforce their argument that the provision seeks to restrict the rights of the copyright holder rather than the other way around, the Ninth Circuit in its judgement also cited the legislative history of the provision where Congress itself states that that 'rights granted (to copyright holder) in 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 106 are subject to sections 107 through 118 and must be read in conjunction to those provisions', which are meant to 'provide various limitations, qualifications, or exemptions (to rights granted in section 106).'H.R. Rep. No. 94-1476, at 61 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5674. Also, specifically with respect to 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 114(b) the Court cited a House Report which when discussing the provision stated that 'infringement (would only) take place whenever all or any substantial portion of the actual sounds that go to make up a copyrighted sound recording are reproduced......';H.R. Rep. No. 94-1476, at 106 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5721 by stating that substantiality of sounds reproduced is a factor to be considered when determining claims of infringement it clarified that a de minimis defense exists even in the case of sound recordings. Once these arguments forwarded by the Bridgeport Music Case are set aside, all that remains is that the new artist used expressive contents from the original artist, but this stands true in various artforms and ventures (e.g. creation of picture collages,Sandoval v. New Line Cinema Corp., 147 F.3d 215, 216 (2d Cir. 1998) usage of small portions of old works as quotes in an analytical piece) where the de minimis defense continues to be applicable.4 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright ¬ß 13.03[A][2][b], at 13-63 to 13-64. Finally, the Ninth Circuit Court stated that the lack of legislative action in the aftermath of a judicial statutory interpretation is not indicative of legislative assent of such interpretation and such holds true even in the case of an interpretation by the Supreme Court which affects the laws of the entire nation.Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 292 (2001) Thus, congressional inaction in the aftermath of a decision taken by a single Circuit Court is of even lesser weight and must not be a factor to be considered in the final ruling. Therefore, the Court is justified in ignoring the ruling of the Sixth Circuit in the Bridgeport Music case and holding that the de minimis defense exists even in the realm of sound recordings according to which the defendant is not guilty of copyright infringement  Dissenting opinion  In the minority opinion delivered by Silverman J., the judge stated that the Bridgeport decision had governed the music industry for almost three decades without 'having the sky fall in' or necessitating Congressional intervention. Moreover, he stated that the reasoning provided in the decision in that case was legally sound as can be gleaned from a joint reading of 17 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 106 and 114 which state that the original artist has 'the exclusive right to prepare derivative works in which the actual sounds fixed in the sound recording are rearranged, remixed, or otherwise altered in sequence or quality.', whereas the de minimis defense cannot be found anywhere in the statute. He also reiterated the Sixth Circuits characterization in Bridgeport of sampling as stealing, misappropriation and an act of 'physical taking rather than an intellectual one', and therefore inherently infringing in nature. Finally, the judge stated that the bright line licensing rule is easy and efficient to interpret while the introduction of a 'de minimis' inquiry by the majority shall is 'fuzzy' and 'visceral' and shall only add to the burden of the dockets of copyright courts across the United States. Thus, he stated that he dissents from the majority decision.  Significance and consequences of the ruling  In holding that the de minimis defense applies even in the case of sound recordings the Ninth Circuit has given a great boost to artforms where sampling is used as a form of creative expression, most prominently among them being hip-hop.Jacob Quinn, VMG Salsoul, L.L.C. v. Ciccone: The Ninth Circuit Strikes a Pose, Applying the De Minimis Exception to Music Sampling, 20 SMU Sci. & Tech. L. Rev. 61 (2017), available at https://scholar.smu.edu/scitech/vol20/iss1/6 Sampling was ubiquitous and a widespread practice in the hip-hop industry before the twin blows delivered to unlicensed sampling, regardless of duration, nature or substantiality by the decisions in Grand Upright Music Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records, Inc. and the Bridgeport Music case. Despite this hip-hop has grown to be the dominant genre in the musical industry, and this decision may have a great role in further boosting its growth. As much of the hip-hop industry is located in the regions which are bound by the decisions of the Ninth Circuit it is to be seen whether this gives impetus to creativity in sampling in the industry and effectively balances the public rights of artists who seek to easily access resources to create new works, and private rights of copyright holders who believe they should be compensated for substantial, or prominent use of their intellectual property in the creation of new art.Ibid. The decision is also of great significance as this is one of the first major judgements after Bridgeport Music which expressly rejects its holding of bright line licensing according to which a license is necessary whenever sampling was done, regardless of the duration or how substantial the sample was. This has only added to the growing instances of opposition to the Bridgeport Music ruling by courts which are not bound by its decision.Steward v. West, No. 13- 02449, Docket No. 179 at 14 n.8 (C.D. Cal. 2014); Batiste v. Najm, 28 F. Supp. 3d 595, 625 (E.D. La. 2014); o EMI Records Ltd v. Premise Media Corp., No. 601209, 2008 WL 5027245 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Aug. 8, 2008). However, this is the first instance of another circuit court rejecting the reasoning given by the Sixth Circuit in the Bridgeport Music case. This opposition to a judgement given by a Circuit Court by another Circuit Court of a different region implies that copyright law shall be implemented in a different manner in different regions of the United States, which is not a decision to be taken lightly. This is called a circuit split. Finally, concerns have also been voiced that allowing this matter in court for an alleged infringement that occurred almost twenty years ago would flood the copyright dockets in the absence of a clear statute of limitations for actions of copyright infringement.Copyright, Eric Goldman ¬∑ in (2016-06-03). \\"De Minimis Music Sampling Isn't Infringement-Salsoul v.

July 11, 2018) is a United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit case concerning Copyright Infringement of Sound Recording. In August 2013, Pharrell William, Robin Thicke and Clifford Joseph Harris (known by his stage name, ‚ÄúT.I.‚Äù) filed a complaint for declaratory relief against the members of Marvin Gaye's family and Bridgeport Music in the United States district court for the Central District of California; that the song Blurred Lines did not infringe the copyright of defendants in Got To Give It Up and Sexy Ways respectively. On 6 October 2017, Circuit Court held oral arguments on the appeal to vacate the district court‚Äôs Judgement. The Ninth Circuit upheld the District Court's decision against William and Thicke and affirmed liability of millions of dollar as damages. It was established that \\"Got to give it up\\" is \\"entitled to broad protection against copyright infringement liability because musical compositions are not confined to a narrow range of expression\\".  Background  Blurred Lines is a song by American songwriter Thicke, William and rapper T.I. It was an undeniable hit, spending 12 weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 and ultimately reaching the number two spot on the year end Billboard Hot 100. However, the song became a subject for bitter dispute with Gaye's family and Bridgeport Music, who claimed that the song infringed on their copyright and is inspired by their songs i.e. 'Got to give it up' and 'Sexy Ways' respectively.  Complaint for declaratory relief  Notably, unlike the traditional manner, the litigation started with preemptive filing of declaratory relief. On August 2013, Williams, Thicke and T.I filed a complaint for declaratory relief against Gaye's family and Bridgeport Music. Prior to the complaint, Gaye's family and Bridgeport Music alleged that the plaintiff has \\"ripped-off\\" the 1977 Billboard single, \\" Got to Give it Up\\". The complaint argued that, \\"The basis of the Gaye defendants' claims is that \\"Blurred Lines\\" and \\"Got To Give It Up\\" \\"feel\\" or \\"sound\\" the same. Being reminiscent of a \\"sound\\" is not copyright infringement. The intent in producing \\"Blurred Lines\\" was to evoke an era. In reality, the Gaye defendants are claiming ownership of an entire genre, as opposed to a specific work\\". They argued that they did not copy the expression but only the 'idea' or the 'genre', which is not copyright-able. = Plaintiff's disposition = Pharrell Williams stated that the two songs were \\"completely different\\" adding that \\"Just simply go to the piano and play the two. One's minor and one's major. And not even in the same key\\". Robin Thicke stated that at the time of recording he was, \\"high on Vicodin and alcohol when [he] showed up at the studio\\", and so \\"Pharrell had the beat and he wrote almost every single part of the song\\". = Counter-claim = In the counter-claim Gaye's family argue that the songs were not merely stylistically similar; instead, they claim that \\"Many of the main vocal and instrumental themes of Blurred Lines are rooted in Got to Give it Up; namely, the signature phrase, vocal hook, backup vocal hook, their variations, and the keyboard and bass lines\\" and \\"the substantial similarities are the result of many of the same deliberate creative choices made by their respective composers.\\" = Motion for summary judgement = In July 2014, the plaintiff's filled for a motion of summary judgement arguing. However, on 30th October 2014, the court denied the motion. Judge John A. Kronstadt after reviewing the reports from competing musicologists, decided that, \\"[the plaintiffs] have made a sufficient showing that elements of 'Blurred Lines' may be substantially similar to protected, original elements of 'Got to Give It Up'.\\"  Holding = Trial  The trial started in District Court on 10 February 2015. Plaintiffs filed a successful motion in limine pleading that Gaye's sound recording of \\"Got to give it up\\" shall be excluded from being played during the trial. The motion was successful since Marvin Gaye's voice had no relevance in the case. The dispute was limited to the elements from sheet music. Judge Kronstad stated that, \\"I don't expect Gaye's voice to be a part of the case\\". The jury was to decide whether \\"Blurred Lines\\" infringed upon the following limited elements: i) Signature Phrase ii) Hooks iii) Bass Lines iv) Harmonic Structures, and v) Keyboard Chords. The Jury was allowed to hear a limited portion of Gaye's sound recording that substantially reflected the disputed subject-matter. The portion was edited to remove unprotected elements. On 10th March 2015, the jury unanimously found Thicke and Williams liable for copyright infringement. It awarded a sum of $7.4 million as damages for the infringement to Gaye's family. The amount was reduced by the District Court to $5.3 million, along with 50 percent royalty on future songwriter and publishing revenue of Blurred Lines. On 11 January 2016, Gaye's family moved an application for approximately $3.5 million in attorney fees and costs on the grounds that the jury verdict prevailed on merits, rather than on a technical issue. The Court denied the application and ordered further submissions on the issue of costs.  Appeal  In August 2016, Thicke, Williams and T.I. appealed against the judgement on the grounds that the Gaye family failed to show substantial similarity between the two songs. Later, a number of amicus curiae briefs were filed in support of the appeal by musicians, musicologists and copyright scholars. Musicians such as John Oates, R. Kelly, et al. filed the brief drafted by attorney Edwin McPherson. They claimed that the judgement would have a deleterious effect on innovation in popular music industry and that the jury's verdict was based on flawed testimony by Gaye's family musical expert. In March 2018, the Court of Appeals upheld the District Court's decision against Williams and Thicke. = Dissent = Appellate Court Judge Jacqueline Nguyen, in her dissenting opinion, held that \\"Blurred Lines\\" and \\"Got to Give Up\\" were not subjectively similar. These songs differed in \\"melody, harmony\\" and \\"rhythm\\" and thus lack extrinsic similarity. She claimed that the judgement allows for protection over musical style and stated that, ‚Äú [it] establishes a dangerous precedent that strikes a devastating blow to future musicians and composers everywhere‚Äù.  Subsequent development  In December 2019, Gaye filed a second attempt for attorney's fees and costs based on Williams remark after the disposition was in favor of Gaye's. In March 2020, Pharrell Williams has filed a counter-claim for the same.  Commentary and implication  Copyright scholars and musicians closely followed the case since it directly addressed the question of copyright protection for sheet music elements other than melody, harmony and rhythm. Many scholars have expressed concern that the case can open a pandora's box of litigation and will cause substantial damage to the music industry, potentially causing a chilling effect. Another concern was that the case was essentially decided by the jury and judge, thus potentially failing the requirement of 'extrinsic test'. Another set of scholars supports the judgement, claiming that the revenue of the music industry is not impacted.  See also  * Substantial Similarity * Inverse-Ratio Rule * Swirsky v.

Literary works  Ikonomi debuted in April 2011 with ‚ÄúFaik Konica: Jeta n√´ Uashington‚Äù (Faik Konitza: Life in Washington), a biography in the Albanian language that won high praise for the new revelations about the life of Albania's prominent writer and diplomat, Faik Konitza. The book became a national bestseller. Ilir Ikonomi is the author of ‚ÄúPavar√´sia: Udh√´timi i paharruar i Ismail Qemalit‚Äù (Independence: The Unforgettable Journey of Ismail Kemal). The book was published in 2012 on the 100th anniversary of Albania's independence and was warmly received for breaking new ground in the study of the events leading to the founding of the state of Albania. It tracks the historic journey of Albania's founding father Ismail Kemal that took him from Istanbul to Vlora to proclaim independence from the Ottoman rule. The book quickly became popular and won the author a Medal of Gratitude from the President of Albania, Bujar Nishani. In May 2014, Ikonomi published ‚ÄúPushtimi,‚Äù a work on the 1939 occupation of Albania by fascist Italy, as narrated by Hugh G. Grant, the U.S. Envoy in Tirana when the invasion took place.

Returning to Albania, he worked for the government controlled Radio Tirana as a Chinese language translator until the end of 1991. As the old communist regime began to collapse, he was hired by Reuters news agency, becoming its first correspondent in Albania. His reports covered a wide range of topics and were printed in newspapers worldwide, including the New York Times, the Washington Times and others. In September 1992, he left Albania to work for the Voice of America, a Washington, DC-based media organization funded by the U.S. Congress.

Early life and family  Goodlett was born on November 3, 1833 to Caroline Huntley Barker and Charles Nicholas Minor Meriwether at Woodstock, her family's plantation in Todd County, Kentucky. On December 3, 1853 she married John Sturdevant. As a wedding present, her father gave her three-hundred acres of land near Woodstock, across the state line in Montgomery County, Tennessee. The property included a large two-story log house, where her father had lived prior to building Woodstock. Goodlett and Sturdevant had one child, a son named Charles James. The marriage was an unhappy one and the couple later divorced.  Confederate philanthropy  At the beginning of the American Civil War, Goodlett's brother Edward enlisted to serve in the Confederate States Army. After his death in 1861, Goodlett focused on aiding the Confederacy. She converted her tobacco barns into workshops where women from her community would gather to make bandages and clothing for Confederate soldiers. Goodlett also nursed wounded soldiers that were housed on her estate until they were taken to hospitals and brought medicine and other supplies to Confederate troops. After the war, Goodlett sold her property and moved with her son to Nashville. In 1866 she founded the Benevolent Society with the purpose of funding medical treatments and artificial limbs for wounded Confederate veterans. She became a charter member of the Board of Confederate Monumental Association, funding the construction of Confederate monuments in Nashville. In 1869 she married Colonel Michael Campbell Goodlett, a Confederate veteran officer and widower. Her husband was the brother of John A. Goodlett. They had one daughter, Caroline Barker Goodlett, who was born on October 3, 1871. In 1893 she represented Tennessee as a commissioner at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.  United Daughters of the Confederacy  Goodlett was elected president of The Auxiliary of the Confederate Soldiers' Home in Tennessee in 1890. The organization was established to assist widows, wives, and children of Confederate veterans. The Auxiliary later changed its name to The Daughters of the Confederacy in 1892. She served as the state president of the organization. She was unaware that, at this time, another society bearing the name \\"Daughters of the Confederacy\\" was being run by Anna Davenport Raines in Georgia. Goodlett and Raines were made aware of each other's organizations and joined them together, extending invitations to similar women' societies in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Missouri to create the National Association of the Daughters of the Confederacy. When the organization became a national organization in 1894, Goodlett was elected as the first president. In 1905 she was recognized as the organization's founder at the General Convention in San Francisco.  Death  Goodlett died on October 16, 1914 and was buried in the family plot in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville.

He had also served as a special assistant to Jesse H. Jones, the former Secretary of Commerce and Federal Loan Administrator. In September 1946, President Truman fired Wallace for delivering a speech urging conciliatory policies towards the Soviet Union, and asked his \\"personal friend\\" Schindler to serve as acting Secretary, although Schindler had been planning to retire from the government service and enter business on the West Coast. Schindler felt that \\"the Department of Commerce should be the business man's home in Government.\\" Although considered the most likely successor to Wallace as Commerce Secretary, Truman appointed W. Averell Harriman as appointed as Secretary of the Treasury. After Harriman took office, he persuaded Schindler to stay in his role for a few months before returning to private industry. Truman appointed New York businessman William Chapman Foster as Schindler's successor as Under Secretary, and Schindler returned to St. Louis. In 1947, he was elected president of the National Federation of Sales Executives and in 1948, he was elected to their board of directors. Schindler gave talks stressing public service and free enterprise. In 1961, he donated his papers to the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum. Personal life Schindler died of infirmities at his home in St. Louis on January 2, 1987 and his funeral was held at Unity Christ Church in Clayton, Missouri. He was survived by his wife Katherine Schindler. ReferencesExternal links *Alfred Schindler Papers at the Harry S.

It was built in 1937-38 as an expansion to Dachau concentration camp. Between 1941 and 1942, more than 4,000 Soviet prisoners were murdered on the site. These were mainly officers, communist officials, and Jews. The victims were ‚Äúsingled out‚Äù according to ideological and racist criteria by Gestapo Einsatzkommandos in the POW camps of the military districts of Munich, Nuremberg, Stuttgart, Wiesbaden and Salzburg. After World War II, American troops assumed control of the site and continued to use it as a firing range. It is now a memorial to Nazi victims.  Summary  Memorial Shooting Range Hebertshausen In the 1950s, the land was handed over to the Free State of Bavaria and administered by the Bavarian Ministry of Finance. Since 1997, the site has been in the care of the Foundation of Bavarian Memorial Places (German: Stiftung Bayerische Gedenkst√§tten), and in 2014, the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site opened a redesigned memorial site upon the grounds.  Establishment of the shooting range According to Colonel General Franz Halder, Chief of Staff of the German Army High Command, Germany‚Äôs military campaign against Russia aimed, among other things, at the ‚Äúdestruction of the Bolshevik commissars and the Communist intelligence.‚Äù Fearing that the Soviet POWs held in camps on German territory could infiltrate the local population and spread communist propaganda, the SS, rather than the Wehrmacht, assumed control of Soviet POWs, in defiance of international law.https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/commissar- order The ‚ÄúCommissar Order‚Äù (Einsatzbefehle) nos. 8 and 9‚Äîthe so-called Commissar Order‚Äîissued by Reinhard Heydrich on 17 and 21 July 1941 to the Einsatzkommandos of the security police and the security service reveal the Nazi leadership‚Äôs intentions for Soviet POWs. As stated in the Commissar Order no. 8, the aim was the ‚Äúpolitical review of all camp inmates (i.e., Soviet prisoners of war) and further treatment. Among the prisoners of war are all the important functionaries of the state and the party, especially the functionaries of the Comintern, all the authoritative party functionaries of the CPSU ... all people‚Äôs commissars ... all former political commissars in the Red Army, ... the leading personalities of economic life, the Soviet Russian intelligentsia, all Jews, all persons identified as agitators or fanatical communists.‚ÄùGeneraloberst Halder: Kriegstagebuch. Hrsg.: Percy Ernst Schramm. Band II. Bernard & Graefe Verlag f√ºr Wehrwesen, Frankfurt am Main 1942 The Commissar Order no. 9 states, among other things, that the executions of the Russians who have been singled out in POW camps on Reich territory were to be carried out ‚Äúinconspicuously in the nearest concentration camp.‚Äùhttp://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/pdf/eng/English58.pdf  Mass shootings in the Dachau Concentration Camp = Shootings in the bunker yard  The mass executions of Soviet POWs began in August and September 1941, after the Stapostelle Regensburg, among others, initiated the ‚Äúselection‚Äù (Aussonderung) process in the weeks prior. This ‚Äúselection‚Äù was based on the principle of denunciation, which was repeatedly ‚Äúhelped along‚Äù by torture. Soviet prisoners of war from the POW camps Hammelburg in the Rh√∂n Mountains (higher officers and enlisted men), Nuremberg-Langwasser, Memmingen, Moosburg and the Stuttgart military districts were ‚Äúselected‚Äù and taken to the Dachau concentration camp. Gestapo agents accompanied these irregular transports to Dachau. About these transports, Paul Ohlers, head of one of the Einsatzkommandos, recounted that ‚Äúthe Russian prisoners of war were bound together with metal shackles, two men each, during the transport. The transports usually took place at night in the winter of 1941/42 and lasted an average of 12-18 hours. The cars were not heated.‚Äù Otto Ambros: Eidesstattliche Erkl√§rung. In: Archiv des Fritz Bauer Instituts (Hrsg.): N√ºrnberger Nachfolgeprozess Fall VI. 29. April 1947, S. 1‚Äì25. 1 100 officers were brought to Dachau from the officer camp and approximately 2 000 from the enlisted men‚Äôs camps in Hammelburg and Nuremberg-Langwasser. Of those ‚Äúselected‚Äù in the POW camps, none survived after being taken to Dachau. According to the instructions stipulated by the SS leadership in Dachau, the names of these POWs were not allowed to be registered in the camp list. Only the numbers of their identification tags could be noted. This procedure was designed to render it impossible to trace and identify these men. In order to keep the shootings secret, the prisoners working in the maintenance building and elsewhere in the vicinity were ordered back to the barracks during the executions which took place in the courtyard of the camp‚Äôs prison. The dead were cremated in the camp‚Äôs crematorium and in a crematorium in Munich.  Shootings at the SS Shooting Range near Hebertshausen  The SS feared it would be impossible to maintain the secrecy of the executions if they continued within the grounds of the concentration camp and thus transferred the executions to the practice shooting range near Hebertshausen, which lies approximately one and a half kilometers away from the concentration camp. The first executions at the shooting range took place on 4 September 1941 and the last in May and June 1942. Thereafter, additional executions were carried out near the camp‚Äôs crematorium. In total, approximately 4,000 Soviet POWs were executed in Dachau, the majority of them at the SS shooting range near Hebertshausen. The actual location of the mass shootings was the pistol shooting range, which was surrounded by a high wooden fence to prevent observations from the surrounding fields. According to the testimony of eye witness Joseph Thora, the prisoners were told beforehand that they were about to be murdered, which prompted diverse reactions amongst the prisoners. Josef Thora: Vernehmungsaussagen vor dem Landgericht. N√ºrnberg 1950. Some showed practically no reaction and ‚Äústood there as if paralyzed; others resisted, began to cry and scream ... that they were opponents of Bolshevism, that they were members of the Russian Church.‚ÄùBericht √ºber die Ausgrabungen am Schie√üplatz. In: S√ºddeutsche Zeitung. 6. Juni 2002. While executions are normally aimed at a victim‚Äôs chest, the SS in some cases aimed at the victims‚Äô heads, causing the heads to practically ‚Äúexplode.‚Äù Coffins that were used to transport the bodies were stored in a shed built on the eastern edge of the shooting range. These coffins were used to transport the bodies to the camp crematorium and then brought back to the shooting range for reuse. The simple coffins were later lined with zinc sheets to prevent the leakage of blood. Over the years after the war, human remains were found during the excavations on site in Hebertshausen. It is assumed that the triple number of excavated human skull parts is still in the ground today. The findings shocked and surprised the archaeologists at the same time. Because \\"typical\\" executions were usually aimed at the chest. But even the head would only have been pierced with the high-speed projectiles used at that time, but not splintered. An investigation in the Anthropological State Collection in Munich by Olav R√∂hrer-Ertl then showed \\"that at least part of the shootings were carried out with increased cruelty.\\"https://www.kz-gedenkstaette-dachau.de/gedenkakt- am-22-juni-2011/  Ideological intent of the shootings and reactions of the SS  The executions served as an education in cruelty for the SS-men as they witnessed and perpetrated ‚Äúa tremendous bloodbath,‚Äù as the shots to the head sent blood and brain mass splashing for meters around. The shootings were intended to ‚Äúharden‚Äù the SS and inure them for the worst, preparing them to execute even the toughest commands without contradiction. In addition, these actions were designed to tie the SS-men to the regime through complicity and thus establish a ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù of perpetrators. After the executions, a number of SS-men became depressed and mentally stressed. In order to increase motivation, the SS leadership offered ‚Äúrewards‚Äù consisting of special promotions, schnapps and cigarettes, snacks (Brotzeit), days off duty, medals (War Merit Cross Second Class, with swords), and for particularly dedicated SS-men, holidays in Italy. According to his memoirs, a man whose father was an SS guard in the Dachau concentration camp regards the membership of one of his closest family members to the SS Guards (SS-Wachmannschaft) as a completely normal profession as any other. It was not until many years later that he began to doubt the innocence of his father and the harmlessness of his professional activities. During a visit to the memorial site of the former ‚ÄúSS-Schie√üplatz Hebertshausen,‚Äù he read on an information board that SS men involved in firing squads were able to go on holiday in Italy in the summer of 1942 as a ‚Äúreward.‚Äù Interestingly, he stated in an interview that, he was not sure, but there exist photos of his father vacationing in Palermo and Naples.Thomas Schlichenmayer: Dem Autor namentlich bekannter Zeitzeuge. Hrsg.: Archiv KZ Gedenkst√§tte Dachau. Dachau 3. November 2016. Nevertheless, he repressed these doubts once again. He is convinced that his father was sentenced to eight years in prison ‚Äúonly‚Äù for slapping a prisoner who had repeatedly violated the camp regulations. He regards the sentence as a great injustice. Thomas Schlichenmayer: Ampermoching in den 50er Jahren. Witschaftswunder und Ver√§nderungen. Herbert Utz Verlag, Dachau 2018, . A total of 190 members of the Kommandanturstab and other men from the guards of the Dachau concentration camp were among the perpetrators. As the research in the book published in 2020 shows, some of SS men were proud of their role in the mass murder of Soviet prisoners of war. \\"Tomorrow we will have a shooting party again,\\" one of them said. Hardly any of the perpetrators had to answer to court after 1945. Egon Zill, Schutzhaftlagerf√ºhrer in the concentration camp, was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1955, but was released after eight years.https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/zweiter-weltkrieg-morgen-haben-wir- wieder- schuetzenfest-1.4943507?fbclid=IwAR3OrOrL5cUOpkhpIppc0JRWcNKM3eT8GHTboS6tm8XUh4xfVAuoKyu39Fw  State of research on the Soviet prisoners of war  According to the prevailing consensus of historical research, many Soviet POWs were not registered upon arrival in Dachau, especially in 1941/42, due to an ideological indifference to their fates or to the predetermined intention to exterminate them. Consequently, these prisoners lived in a space free from legal constraints. There was no accountability for their deaths, because in formal terms, they did not exist at all. The deaths of many Soviet soldiers were simply not recorded; they were simply buried in mass graves so that, in contrast to the deceased of other nations, it was impossible to identify their whereabouts and burial location after the war. Thus, an unknown but extremely high number of dead rest in Soviet war graves in Germany. Nonetheless, with a few exceptions, all Soviet POWs were in fact registered on so-called staff cards in the POW camps as soon as they were brought into the German Reich. On these cards, all their personal and military data (places of work, illnesses and hospitalizations, vaccinations, escapes, punishments, etc.) was recorded. This information was submitted in the form of acquisition lists to the Wehrmacht Information Office (WASt) in Berlin. In the event of death, these personnel cards were sent to Berlin together with other documents (identification tags, proof of death, lists recording a decrease in prisoners, etc.) so that the WASt had an overview at all times of all deceased POWs, including those who had been delivered to the SS and murdered in Dachau. These documents, as well as other items related to the prisoners, were outsourced to Meiningen in 1943 and handed over to the Soviet troops in 1945; since then they have been considered lost. Historians Dr. Reinhard Otto and Rolf Keller succeeded in locating these card index documents; some fragments lie in the German Information Office (Deutsche Dienststelle) in Berlin, the successor of the WASt. The great majority, however, lie in the archive of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation in Podolsk (ZAMO); Otto and Keller subjected these documents to an initial review over a period of several visits. They discovered that the personnel cards of the Soviet soldiers who died in the Reich (approx. 370,000) can be found in their entirety in this archive, in addition to other card documents, reports of hospital stays, lists of transports to and from the POW camps, and lists of deceased persons. There is also a separate card index of 80,000 officers. Via the personnel cards, extensive transfers between the various concentration camps can also be traced. At any rate, the file documents provide detailed evidence of the whereabouts of each prisoner. These documents were torn out of their original arrangement after the war and were arbitrarily bound together into new volumes of files, each containing approximately 100 index cards. They are organized neither alphabetically nor according to camps. Rather, the officers‚Äô card index has been rearranged according to the Russian alphabet. The Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site estimates that between 1500 and 2000 names of victims who were murdered in Hebertshausen can be identified over the long term. Currently, 816 names are listed on the memorial installation in Hebertshausen. First Public Announcement of Names in \\"Komsomolskaya Pravda\\" On January 16, 2014, the Russian newspaper ‚ÄúKomsomolskaya Pravda‚Äù published a list of 62 Soviet prisoners of war who were shot at the SS shooting range in Hebertshausen, a publication that generated a flood of feedback. Several readers learned the cruel truth about their relatives‚Äô fates for the first time in seventy-two years. So a daughter who has been trying to find the traces of her father, Leonid Nikolaevich Bushkov, ever since he was drafted to the army in 1941 before she was born, found out the truth about her father's death.https://www.chel.kp.ru/daily/26197/3084680/  SS shooting range Hebertshausen after the war  American troops took possession of the more than 8 ha. large grounds after World War II and continued to use the site as a firing range. In the 1950s, the site was handed over to the Free State of Bavaria and administered by the Ministry of Finance, which apparently had the intention of letting the history of the site fall into oblivion. In 1964, a memorial stone created by the artist Will Elfers and donated by the Dachau Camp Community (Lagergemeinschaft Dachau) was set up in front of the bullet traps. After a short time there, the Ministry of Finance transferred this memorial to the entrance gate of the shooting range. For many years, this brutal crime was suppressed from public view due to the East-West conflict, the annexation of Crimea and the political tensions in relation to Putin's Russia.https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/zweiter-weltkrieg-morgen-haben-wir- wieder- schuetzenfest-1.4943507?fbclid=IwAR3OrOrL5cUOpkhpIppc0JRWcNKM3eT8GHTboS6tm8XUh4xfVAuoKyu39Fw It was only in 1997 that a group of committed citizens succeeded in halting the state-sponsored policy of forgetting and repression. The Ministry of Finance ultimately responded to the pressure and transferred the site to the Ministry of Culture, which placed the site under the care of the State Headquarters for Political Education (Landeszentrale f√ºr politische Bildungsarbeit). Will Elfers‚Äô four-ton-heavy memorial stone was moved back to its original place of installation, a clear sign that state policy toward the memorial site of the former SS-Shooting Range Hebertshausen had changed. On June 22, 2011 the human remains found during the excavations were buried in a small wooden box in front of the memorial stone, in a multi-religious celebration with prayers.https://www.kz-gedenkstaette-dachau.de/gedenkakt- am-22-juni-2011/ On May 2, 2014 the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site opened a redesigned memorial site upon the grounds.https://www.kz- gedenkstaette-dachau.de/historischer-ort/virtueller-rundgang-umgebung/ss- schiessplatz-hebertshausen/ Since then, several information boards have been erected on the site to inform visitors about its history in several languages. The installation measures forty meters in length, providing enough space to list all the names of the estimated 4,000 victims. The Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site projects that 1,500 to 2,000 names can be identified in the long term. As of June 2020, there are currently 816 names on the installation. The Munich-based Consulate General of the Russian Federation and the Consulate General of Ukraine both now recognize the former SS-Shooting Range Hebertshausen as a memorial site for their fallen soldiers. Annual memorial ceremonies take place at the site on the anniversary of Operation Barbarossa (June 22), the day Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union in 1941. In addition, yearly ceremonies are held at the site to commemorate the anniversary of the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp (April 29).http://zviazda.by/ru/news/20190702/1562048492-cherez-semdesyat-sem-let- lyudi-uznali-sudbu-svoih-blizkih Next to the memorial site lies the former SS- guardhouse, which the city of Dachau has transformed into a homeless shelter.https://www.tracesofwar.com/sights/957/SS-Shooting-Range- Hebertshausen.htm  References  {{ Category:Dachau concentration camp Category:World War II memorials in Germany Category:World War II sites in Germany Category:Tourist attractions in Bavaria ","title":"Hebertshausen shooting range"},{"id":"64331804","text":"The dotted-line robust slider or West Coast line-spotted lerista (Lerista lineopunctulata) is a species of skink found in Western Australia.
