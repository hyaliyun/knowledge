Features  MainStage might be thought of as a companion app to Logic Pro. It works in much the same way and bears a similar user interface. The focus however, is on live use rather than features like recording and editing that are available in a DAW such as Logic. Instead of a timeline for instance, there is an editable \\"Workspace\\". This allows a user to drag out an object that acts as a software representation of a hardware controller like a button, knob or fader and assign that to a parameter such as volume, pan or even more complex things. MainStage comes bundled with a number of sampled software instruments (such as pianos, guitars, drum kits and pads) as well as effects. These instruments can be played using a pre-recorded MIDI file or via a controller device that uses the MIDI protocol, such as a keyboard or drum pad. It can also act as a \\"host\\" and centralize any third- party virtual instruments or audio units that users might have installed on their computers. Virtual instruments that can be used with MainStage can also be used with Logic Pro. A MainStage concert can display a patch list which displays all the patches created by a user for that concert. Each patch might have a different instrument or effect assigned to it and various parameters can be changed during a performance by cycling through the list. Other features include: * Recording of any audio signal passing through. * Multi- effects processing for external inputs (e.g. a guitar or a microphone/vocals). * Play back of pre-recorded backing tracks. * MIDI transformation via MIDI FX plugins and routing via external instrument channel strips.  Release history  The first version of MainStage was introduced on September 12, 2007, alongside Logic Studio. The second version, MainStage 2, was released on July 23, 2009, along with updated releases of many of the other applications in the Logic Studio package. Version 2.1 released in January 2010, introduced a 64-bit mode. Since version 2.2, updates are available only from the Mac App Store. MainStage 3, was released alongside Logic Pro X on July 16, 2013, as a paid update and available only as a download from the Mac App Store. There is a free iPad companion app available designed for use with Logic Pro X, MainStage 3 and GarageBand, which can act as a hardware controller for various parameters.

Fusion was part owned by Beko, the Turkish electronics giant, who were responsible for all product manufacture. In 2005 Beko bought out Fusion Digital Technology, and took over the Digifusion brand. Products The most notable Digifusion product to date was the FVRT series of Freeview PVRs, beginning with the FVRT100 in 2004. In common with Digifusion's basic receiver product, the FRT100, the FVRT100 PVR was one of the first Freeview products to feature a full 7 day (later extended to 14 day) electronic programme guide, or EPG, some months before Freeview itself began to broadcast full EPG data. This was achieved through the use of a proprietary \\"Multiguide\\" EPG. The FVRT100 was one of the first Freeview PVRs which allowed the user to record two channels simultaneously ‚Äì a claim it shared with its contemporary rival, the Thomson DHD-4000. Both boxes also featured 40GB hard disk drives, and were in fact based on the same reference design by 4TV Ltd, who were later to merge with Thomson. The FVRT series also included the FVRT150 (a clone of the FVRT100 with an altered faceplate and 80GB HDD, sold by Argos), the FVRT145 (similar to the FVRT150 but with the front panel indicator lights removed), and the FVRT200, which added repeat recording and a personalised folders feature in the recording library. An FVRT400 was also announced, based on the FVRT200 but with a 160GB HDD, but very limited numbers of these machines were produced or sold through smaller retail outlets. Later products such as the FVRT95 and FVRT90 are single tuner machines (able to record one channel only) and are badged versions of an Access Devices design. These boxes used the standard Freeview EPG data, and not the 14 day \\"Multiguide\\". \\"Multiguide\\" EPG Most Digifusion PVRs were designed to access the proprietary \\"Multiguide\\" EPG, originally provided by 4TV Ltd. EPG data is broadcast in the form of an MHEG application on the \\"4TVInteractive\\" channel (currently Freeview channel 300) from 3 am, at which time the receiving boxes automatically tune to the channel and cache the EPG. Originally this provided the boxes with a full seven-day EPG at a time when Freeview itself only supported now and next information ‚Äì but when Freeview later began broadcasting the now standard eight-day guide, the 4TV system was upgraded to support 14-day listings. However, unlike the standard Freeview EPG, this data is not \\"live\\" as it is only refreshed overnight, and any scheduling changes on the day are not reflected in the EPG. This also prevents the implementation of any Freeview+ features on Multiguide-based products. The Multiguide EPG was used by most Digifusion PVRs, the Thomson DHD-4000, the Inverto IDL-7000, and a number of other receivers, but the last new product based on Multiguide was the Sony SVR-S500 launched in 2006. The EPG service is now maintained by Inview Interactive Limited, the company behind Radio Times Extra, but an increased number of failed EPG downloads during the latter half of 2009 caused some speculation over the Multiguide's future. On 28 June 2010, after another series of failed EPG downloads, InView responded to customer enquiries with the following statement:Digifusion & Inverto EPG Updates Switched Off Unfortunately the transmission of \\"Multiguide\\" EPG has ceased permanently, so owners of PVRs that use this technology (including Digifusion) can either record programs manually, or upgrade to PVRs that use the Freeview eight-day EPG. Recent products Since Digifusion was bought out by Beko, the brand has not been seen on any new products. Beko manufactured a PVR called the SVR-S500 on behalf of Sony, and its internal architecture was virtually identical to the Digifusion FVRT200. It also offered a nearly identical feature set and used the same EPG, although it only displayed 8 days of the 14 day listings downloaded.

A longtime resident of Louisiana, he claims to have been the first New Orleans native chess master of comparable strength since Paul Morphy. Acers in the French Quarter in 2011 He is also known for being a great showman, touring the country giving simultaneous chess exhibitions. He was twice the world record holder of having played the most opponents in a simultaneous exhibition. First against 117 opponents (1974, Lloyd Center, Portland, Oregon), then against 179 opponents (1976, Mid Island Plaza, Long Island, New York). The records were certified by the Guinness Book of World Records. Acers barely survived Hurricane Katrina and lived in a displaced persons camp for some time. As the city recovered, he returned to New Orleans and resumed his customary chess table in the French Quarter. Playing strength Questions have arisen concerning his actual strength at chess. He got his U.S. Chess Federation (USCF) rating up to 2399, just one point below Senior Master, by playing matches against players who had never played rated chess before. This led the USCF Executive Director Ed Edmondson to freeze his rating at 2399 until he played in an open tournament. Ever since, for the last nearly 40 years, Acers has not played in a rated open tournament until the World Senior Championship held in September 2007 in Gmunden, Austria. Acers defeated veteran master Bill Hook of the British Virgin Islands in the first round. Acers' recent result at the 17th World Senior Chess Championship, with a FIDE performance of 2289, should help to confirm his playing strength. Author/writer Acers has written or contributed to several chess books. In 2008 he is working on The Road which will be a book about his chess tours.

Officials in the MSU Athletic Department noticed Gary and Zeke's success and in 1977 invited them to perform during a Spartan football game. They did so, and a new tradition was born. In 1978, head coach Darryl Rogers was quoted as saying Zeke was the best receiver in the Big Ten. He awarded Zeke a football letter, \\"to this day the only non-human to letter at Michigan State.\\" After 1981, Zeke performed on a limited basis before his retirement at the age of ten in 1984. He died in 1987.  Keze  Keze (pronounced \\"Kee-zee\\"), no relation to Zeke, was a chocolate Lab and the runt of her litter; her small size made her a more agile performer than her larger \\"brother\\". Keze's name, the reversal of Zeke, was the result of \\"a contest run by the Lansing State Journal that received more than 12,000 entries.\\" She performed for a single season in 1981. The following year, she was hit by a car and killed.  Zeke II  After a hiatus of eighteen years, in 2002 the MSU Athletic Department revived the frisbee-dog tradition. Open auditions resulted in the selection of Dexter, a black Lab owned by Terry and Jim Foley of Holland, Michigan. Dexter, as Zeke II, was an immediate hit with MSU alumni who remembered the original Zeke the Wonder Dog, and quickly established himself with current MSU students who were likely too young to remember Zeke. Handled by Jim Foley, and with training guidance provided by the original Zeke's Gary Eisenberg, Zeke II performed throughout the 2002‚Äì2005 football seasons. In December 2005, Dexter was admitted to the MSU Small Animal Clinic for an intestinal obstruction caused by having eaten a substantial amount of carpet at his home. Thanks to the efforts of Dr. Bryden Stanley and her staff, who completed a 90-minute abdominal surgery, Dexter's life was spared. Zeke II returned to halftime action for the 2006 football season, but prior to the November 11 game against Minnesota he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right rear knee and was again admitted to the MSU Small Animal Clinic. Dr. Loic Dejardin, an orthopedic surgeon at MSU‚Äôs Veterinary Teaching Hospital, repaired the damage. Two months of rehabilitation followed. In 2007, Zeke II began to show signs of age, particularly with cataracts that were beginning to cloud his eyes and hinder his ability to see the disc. At the age of ten, Zeke II performed his final show on September 8, 2007, completing a brief two-minute routine while the Spartan Alumni Marching Band played the \\"Zeke the Wonder Dog Medley\\"‚Äîconsisting of \\"(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?\\", \\"Who Let The Dogs Out\\", and Led Zeppelin's \\"Black Dog\\". Some of the Frisbees were tossed by Dr. Dejardin, Zeke II's orthopedic surgeon. On the morning of February 11, 2012, Zeke II died peacefully at the age of 16.  Zeke III  In anticipation of Dexter's retirement, the Foleys began training his replacement in 2006, with Eisenberg again as their training advisor. Bou Cou, a 21-month-old male pedigreed yellow Lab, debuted as Zeke III at halftime in Spartan Stadium on September 15, 2007. He died suddenly on December 2, 2016 from a previously undiagnosed pancreatic tumor.  Zeke IV  Buckshot succeeded as Zeke IV. He debuted during the MSU Men's Basketball game on December 3, 2016 vs the Oral Roberts Golden Eagles.

Date honey, date syrup, date molasses or rub (, ; or ◊°◊ô◊ú◊ê◊ü, silan; ) is a thick dark brown, very sweet fruit syrup extracted from dates. It is widely used in North African and Middle Eastern cooking. Nutritional aspects Date syrup is rich in the monosaccharides glucose and fructose, and so most of its sugar content is absorbed into the bloodstream in the mouth, meaning that it raises the blood glucose levels more efficiently and immediately than other syrups. It is therefore highly suitable for people suffering from hypoglycaemia, or for those with sucrose intolerance or those with pancreatic problems who have difficulty absorbing disaccharides. Date syrup is higher in magnesium and potassium than some natural sweeteners such as maple syrup and honey and so has been a popular alternative to sugar in recent years. It is also rich in antioxidants due to its high phenolic and flavonoid content and has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. In national cuisines It is used widely in Libya, usually with asida, a porridge-like dessert. In Iranian cuisine, date syrup is used to sweeten ardeh (tahini), consumed at breakfast.

He taught in a small school before completing his undergraduate studies at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia. Career Broadus was ordained in 1850 and became pastor of the Baptist church in Charlottesville. In 1859, Broadus along with James P. Boyce, Basil Manly Jr., and William Williams, founded the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Greenville, South Carolina. Broadus became professor of New Testament interpretation and homiletics at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. During the American Civil War, he served as a Confederate chaplain to Robert E. Lee's army in Northern Virginia. He delivered a lecture at the University of Virginia in memorial to Professor Gessner Harrison in 1873. In 2018 the President of the Seminary commissioned a report of the organization's four founders, which found that Broadus and the others owned 50 slaves, Broadus owning at least two slaves, and the faculty and trustees at the seminary defended the ‚Äúrighteousness of slavery‚Äù and supported the Confederacy‚Äôs efforts to preserve slavery. Broadus repudiated American slavery in 1882. In 1883, he delivered an address on the Confederate cause at Louisville's Cave Hill Cemetery. That was an important part of reunion, as he argued that both sides were partly correct in their positions that led to war. In 1888, he became Southern Seminary's second president. In 1889, Broadus delivered the Beecher Lectures at Yale Divinity School. Broadus died in 1895. Personal life Broadus married Maria Carter Harrison on Nov. 14, 1849 . She died Oct. 21, 1857.

In coordination with a wide array of interacting partners, DISC1 has been shown to participate in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, neuronal axon and dendrite outgrowth, mitochondrial transport, fission and/or fusion, and cell-to-cell adhesion. Several studies have shown that unregulated expression or altered protein structure of DISC1 may predispose individuals to the development of schizophrenia, clinical depression, bipolar disorder, and other psychiatric conditions. The cellular functions that are disrupted by permutations in DISC1, which lead to the development of these disorders, have yet to be clearly defined and are the subject of current ongoing research. Although, recent genetic studies of large schizophrenia cohorts have failed to implicate DISC1 as a risk gene at the gene level, the DISC1 interactome gene set was associated with schizophrenia, showing evidence from genome-wide association studies of the role of DISC1 and interacting partners in schizophrenia susceptibility.  Discovery  In 1970, researchers from the University of Edinburgh performing cytogenetic research on a group of juvenile offenders in Scotland found an abnormal translocation in chromosome 1 of one of the boys, who also displayed characteristics of an affective psychological disorder. After this initial observation, the boy's family was studied and it was found that 34 out of 77 family members displayed the same translocation. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) (or DSM-IV) criteria, sixteen of the 34 individuals identified as having the genetic mutation were diagnosed with psychiatric problems. In contrast, five of the 43 unaffected family members were identified to have psychological indispositions. The psychiatric illnesses observed in the family ranged from schizophrenia and major depression to bipolar disorder and adolescent conduct disorder (which the original research subject had). After studying this large Scottish family for four generations, in 2000, this gene was given the name \\"DISC1\\". The name was derived from the basis of the molecular nature of the mutation: the translocation directly disrupts the gene. Importance of genetic studies The implication of genetics in psychiatric illnesses is not unique to schizophrenia, though the heritability of schizophrenia has been calculated as high as 80%. The continued research of the family following the discovery of the translocation yielded statistical analysis of the probability of observing the simultaneous occurrence, or co-inheritance, of psychological afflictions and the translocation. This concept was measured quantitatively using the LOD, or logarithm of the odds value. The higher the LOD value, the stronger the correlation between the presence of the translocation and given disease(s) is thought to be. The LOD for the chromosome 1 translocation and identification of schizophrenia alone in the Scottish family was found to be 3.6. The LOD value of the translocation and a broader number of diagnoses (including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar affective disorder, and recurrent major depression) was found to be 7.1. Besides large familial-based studies in which the pedigrees of various family members are examined, twin studies have also been a source of support for researchers in the investigation of DISC1. In a meta-analysis of twin studies, twelve out of fourteen were found to support the fact that from a genetic perspective, schizophrenia is a complex trait that depends on both genetic and environmental factors. Such findings have encouraged researchers to continue with both macro-analysis of the disorders afflicting individuals with the mutation, as well as explore the micro-level.  Gene location and transcription  The DISC1 gene is situated at chromosome 1q42.1 and overlaps with DISC2 open reading frame. Multiple DISC1 isoforms have been identified at the RNA level, including a TSNAX-DISC1 transgene splice variant, and at the protein level. Of the isolated RNA isomers, 4 have been confirmed to be translated namely Long form (L), Long variant isoform (Lv), Small isoform (S), and Especially small isoform (Es). Human DISC1 is transcribed as two major splice variants, L form and Lv isoform. The L and Lv transcripts utilize distal and proximal splice sites, respectively, within exon 11. The L and Lv protein isoforms differ by only 22 amino acids within the C-terminus. Alternate transcriptional splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been characterized. DISC1 homologues have been identified in all major vertebrate families including the common chimpanzee, the rhesus monkey, the house mouse, the brown rat, zebrafish, pufferfish, cattle, and dogs; additionally homologue's have been described for invertebrate and plant phyla.  Protein structure and subcellular distribution  The protein encoded by this gene is predicted to contain a coiled coil motif rich C-terminal domain, and a N-terminal globular domain. The N-terminus contains two putative nuclear localization signals, and a serine-phenylalanine-rich motif of unknown significance. The C-terminus contains multiple regions with coiled-coil forming potential, and two leucine zippers that may mediate protein-protein interactions. The protein locates to the nucleus, centrosome, cytoplasm, mitochondria, axons and synapses. Mitochondria are the predominant site of endogenous DISC1 expression, with at least two isoforms occupying internal mitochondrial locations. No known functional homologues exist for this protein in humans, although it does have broad homology to scaffold proteins. The DISC1 protein function appears to be highly diverse and its functional role in cellular processes is dependent upon the cellular domain it is located in. The presence or absence of certain protein interaction domains or targeting motifs may confer specific functions and influence sub cellular targeting, therefore it is probable that alternative splicing codetermines both the function and the intracellular location of DISC1.  Function  Many studies have provided insight into the normal function of the DISC1 protein, though much remains to be clearly defined. DISC1 is functionally involved in several processes that regulate neural development and brain maturation such as neuronal proliferation, differentiation, migration, cAMP signaling, cytoskeletal modulation, and translational regulation via various signaling pathways. Much of what is understood about the normal function of DISC1 has been uncovered through studies on zebrafish and mice as model organisms. In zebrafish, DISC1 is essential for forebrain development and GSK3/Œ≤-catenin signaling, while in mice the DISC1-GSK3 pathway regulates proliferation of neural progenitor cells in the cortex and adult dentate gyrus. This data suggests a direct DISC1 GSK3/Œ≤-catenin interaction. DISC1 functions through a rich protein-protein interaction network, named the ‚ÄúDISC1 interactome‚Äù by researchers. Among its known interaction partners are 14-3-3Œµ, LIS1 and the PDE4B enzyme. DISC1 may play an important role in neuroplasticity via interactions with molecules of the cytoskeleton and centrosome, such as NUDEL and LIS1. The protein also enables the activity of dynein, a microtubule protein. Controlling transport of microtubules is involved in neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth, and axon formation. DISC1 is highly expressed during critical periods of brain development, particularly in the embryonic ventricular and subventricular zones of the cortex, where neural progenitor cells are found. This localization suggests that DISC1 is an important regulator of embryonic and adult neurogenesis, and may regulate proliferation and/or differentiation. Levels of the protein in cycling neural progenitor cells affects whether they differentiate into neurons or remain as progenitors. Expression profile is highest in the hippocampus during development and remains highly expressed in the adult dentate gyrus and olfactory bulb, regions where adult neurogenesis is present. DISC1 has also been shown to regulate tempo of neuronal integration into the brain and guidance of positioning of new neurons. Due to localization of the protein found at the synapse, DISC1 is also likely to play a key role in postsynaptic density, however this novel role is not yet fully understood.  Protein interactions  The DISC1 protein has no known enzymatic activity; rather it exerts its effect on multiple proteins through interactions to modulate their functional states and biological activities in time and space. These include: DISC1 DISC1 has been shown to self- associate, to form dimers, multimers, and oligomers. The ability of DISC1 to form complexes with itself may be important in regulating its affinity for interacting partners such as NDEL1. In postmortem brain samples of Schizophrenia patients there is an increase in insoluble DISC1 oligomer aggregates, indicative of a common link with other neurological disorders characterised by protein aggregation, namely Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. ATF4/ATF5 ATF4 and ATF5 are members of the leucine zipper activating transcription factor / CREB family. They are known to bind to and regulate the function of GABAB receptors in synapses and are involved in signal transduction from the cell membrane to the nucleus. Both proteins interact with DISC1 and GABAB receptors via their second C-terminal leucine zipper domain, therefore DISC1 is able to regulate GABAB receptor function through its interaction with ATF4/ATF5. FEZ1 DISC1 participates in neurite outgrowth through its interaction with the fasciculation and elongation protein Œ∂-1 (FEZ1). FEZ1 is a mammalian homolog of the C. elegans UNC-76 protein involved in axonal outgrowth and fasciculation. The C-terminal region of FEZ1 (aa 247-392) is required for interaction with DISC1. A DISC1 region (aa 446-633), containing two stretches with coiled-coil-forming potential is critical for its interaction with FEZ1. DISC1-FEZ1 interaction is enhanced during neuro-differentiation, and expression of the FEZ1-binding domain of DISC1 has a dominant negative effect on neurite outgrowth, which implies co-operation of DISC1 and FEZ1 in this process. Kalirin-7 The DISC1 protein plays a role in the process of regulating spine form and function through its interactions with kalirin-7 (kal-7). Kal-7 is a regulator of spine morphology and synaptic plasticity in association with neuronal activity. Kal-7-dependent regulation of spine formation occurs through its activity as a GDP/GTP exchange factor for Rac1. Activation of rac1 by kal-7 leads to increased spine size and synaptic strength through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by rac1. DISC1 is able to bind to kal-7, confining its access to rac1, and in turn regulate spinal formation. Activation of NMDA receptors causes dissociation of DISC1 and kal-7, leaving kal-7 available to activate rac1. MAP1A DISC1 shows strong interaction with the microtubule-associated protein MAP1A that controls the polymerization and stabilization of microtubule networks in neurons, and thereby influence cell shape and intracellular transport of vesicles and organelles. MAP1A binds to the far N-terminus (aa 293-696) of DISC1, and the amino terminus of DISC1 binds to the LC2 subunit of MAP1A. The LC2 subunit of MAP1A contains an actin-binding domain and is necessary and sufficient for microtubule binding and polymerization, therefore DISC1 is able to regulate the ability of MAP1A to polymerize and stabilize microtubules and traffic proteins to their correct localization in the synaptic architecture. NDEL1/NUDEL DISC1 is localized to the centrosome, the primary microtubule organizing center of the cell, via interaction with nuclear distribution gene homologue-like 1 (NDEL1, also called NUDEL), where it is part of a protein complex involved in cytoskeletal processes of neuronal migration, including nucleokinesis and neurite outgrowth. NUDEL is also known to play a role in axon regeneration and has an additional DISC1-modulated function as a cysteine endopeptidase. Localization of NUDEL to axons is dependent on expression of DISC1. NUDEL binds to a 100 amino acid domain of DISC1 (aa 598-697) containing a coiled coil domain and a leucine zipper. The amino acid domain of NUDEL that binds DISC1 is the carboxyl terminal 100 amino acids of the protein (aa 241-345), which contains a cytoplasmic dynein binding site. PCM1/Pericentriolar material The protein Pericentriolar Material 1 (PCM1) which is associated with cilia development in the CNS interacts directly with the Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) and calmodulin 1 (CALM1) proteins. Kamiya et al. have shown that PCM1, DISC1 and BBS4 can all disrupt neuronal organisation in the mouse when their expression is down- regulated. Markers at the pericentriolar material 1 gene (PCM1) have shown genetic association with schizophrenia in several schizophrenia case control studies. Resequencing of the genomic DNA from research volunteers who had inherited haplotypes associated with schizophrenia showed a threonine an isoleucine mis-sense mutation in exon 24 which may change the structure and function of PCM1 (rs370429). This mutation was found only as a heterozygote in ninety eight schizophrenic research subjects and controls out of a total sample of 2,246 case and control research subjects. Amongst the ninety eight carriers of rs370429 sixty seven were affected with schizophrenia. The same alleles and haplotypes were associated with schizophrenia in both London and Aberdeen samples. Another potential aetiological base pair change in PCM1 was rs445422 which altered a splice site signal. A further mutation, rs208747, was shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays to create or destroy a promoter transcription factor site. Five further non-synonymous changes in exons were also found. Given the number and identity of the haplotypes associated with schizophrenia further aetiological base pair changes must exist within and around the PCM1 gene. The findings in relation to PCM1 support the role of DISC1 also being a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia. Other interactions include: ACTN2, CEP63, EIF3A, RANBP9, and SPTBN4. Clinical implications Aberrations of DISC1 are considered a generalized risk factor in major psychiatric diseases and have also been implicated in memory deficits and abnormal patterns of brain activity. DISC1 translocation increases the risk of developing schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression by about 50-fold in comparison to the general population. Efforts to model DISC1 disease biology in transgenic mice, Drosophila, and zebrafish have provided psychiatric disease implications related to DISC1 mutations. However, no specific variant is consistently associated with development of mental disorders, indicating allelic heterogeneity in psychiatric disease. The impact of variants in the DISC1 gene on expression and protein function is not yet clearly defined and associated variants are not necessarily causative. Schizophrenia Schizophrenia affects 1% of the general population and is highly heritable, providing an indication of a genetic basis. DISC1 has been associated with neurological abnormalities such as delusions, deficits in long term and working memory, diminution of gray matter volume in hippocampal and prefrontal regions. These abnormalities are also seen as symptoms of schizophrenia. As DISC1 function is involved in neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, vulnerability to schizophrenia may involve dysfunction in the hippocampus, a brain region in which adult neurogenesis occurs. Autism and Asperger‚Äôs syndrome In 2008, a genetic screen of 97 Finnish families affected by autism and Asperger's syndrome revealed repeated DNA sequences within the DISC1 gene in those diagnosed with autism. Furthermore, a single nucleotide change in the gene was found to be present in 83% of family members with Asperger's syndrome. A recent family study has reported a large chromosome 1 deletion that includes loss of DISC1 in a young boy diagnosed with autism. A link between DISC1 duplication and autism has also been suggested by the finding of a seven-gene duplication that includes DISC1 carried by two brothers with autism and mild retardation. These alterations in people with the disorder are rare, however, as none were found in a screening of 260 Belgians with autism. Transgenic model organism strains generated with mutated or absent DISC1 suggest that the gene may contribute to at least some autistic abnormalities. Mice with lowered levels of DISC1 expression exhibit abnormal response to electrical stimulation, a decrease of dopamine synthesis, and an inability to filter unnecessary sensory information. Studies of expression of mutant DISC1 prenatally and postnatally have demonstrated varying effects, indicating the possibility that early postnatal expression of mutant DISC1 causes features of autism. Many more studies are necessary to confirm these suggestions. Bipolar disorder Linkage studies in extended families multiply affected with bipolar disorder also provide evidence for DISC1 as a genetic factor in the etiology of bipolar disorder. In 1998, a follow-up study was conducted of the large Scottish family in which DISC1 was first discovered. Additional family members with the original translocation who developed major psychotic illness, including bipolar disorder, were identified.  Research directions  As DISC1 investigation continues to be an emerging area of study, many unanswered questions regarding the biological function of the protein and its implications in psychiatric disorders remain. In depth understanding of DISC1 as a genetic risk factor for psychiatric disorders provides a possible target for developing new drug therapies and preventative measures. The pathways regulated by DISC1 interaction may provide possible avenues for therapeutic opportunities to reverse related deficits. Definitive genetic architecture, risk distribution, and their correlation with prognosis is crucial to determining response to new drug treatments. In addition to DISC1, the antisense partner has been identified as DISC2, a noncoding RNA gene that may be involved in regulating the gene locus. However, structure and function of DISC2 remain unknown and may provide insight into how DISC1 is regulated. Rare mutations in DISC1 other than the original translocation have been discovered and require further investigation. Furthermore, posttranslational processing and its effect on isoform expression, which also contributes to protein function and may be involved in some forms of disease, remains to be studied. The ability to predict the impact of different types of mutations on protein function and resulting psychiatric phenotype is crucial for the development of targeted treatments. Family studies continue to provide an important approach towards deepening understanding of the biological nature of the gene and its clinical implications. While the original Scottish family in which DISC1 was discovered is still being considered, other familial populations in different countries have also become the focus of research in the past decade. In 2005, an American family was found to also possess a frameshift mutation in the DISC1 gene, which again co-segregated with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Characterized by a deletion of four base-pairs, the mutation was found in two siblings, one with schizophrenia and the other with schizoaffective disorder. Similar studies have also been done with Taiwanese and Finnish families.

The Treaty of Utrecht was signed in 1474 after the Anglo-Hanseatic War between England and the Hanseatic League. This naval war had begun in 1470 using the naval strategy of commerce raiding in the North Sea and the English Channel; one of the most successful men-of-war was the Peter von Danzig. Driven in the main by the cities Danzig and L√ºbeck, it was a war against increasing English pressure on the trade of the Hanseatic cities of the southern coast of the Baltic sea. England was bankrupt after years of war and mismanagement; pressure against Hanseatic cities trade on the southern coast of the Baltic sea had to be foregone, while Cologne and other German cities had opposed, and were therefore temporarily excluded from, the Hansa. The treaty declared peace between Lubeck and the German Confederation with England, restoring the Hanseatic privileges in the Port of London. These included immunity for Hanseatic franchises from the Tunnage and Poundage levy, which had been guaranteed by the Utrecht Treaty of 1437. It did not however halt the league's long-term decline across Germany, a fact the Prussians recognised during Anglo-Hanse Conference at Utrecht in 1451. The German Hansa could not prevent the Dutch penetrating into Baltic port markets. In Riga the Latvians opposed the Treaty of Utrecht, attempting to use the leaguers to prevent English trade competition with the continent. The Hansa ignored Riga's pleas and the treaty was ratified. While the Merchant Adventurers were excluded from the Baltic, because they had lost the 1468-74 war, they remained prepared for negotiation to restore access to the Low countries. Edward IV drew up peace treaties to clear the path for war with France.T H Lloyd, England and the German Hanse, p.371-3 In a good year as much as 50% of the Exchequer's revenues came from Customs: 10% rate on Cloth, but in 1470, wool taxes were as much as 48% on alien immigrants.

He made more than 250 appearances in the Football League, and a further 76 in the Conference. Biography Poole was born in Stratford, London. He came through the juniors at Tottenham Hotspur and was given a professional contract, but made no appearances for the first team and was released after two years. He signed for Fourth Division club Cambridge United, and after 18 months was sold for ¬£3,000 to Conference side Barnet, managed by Barry Fry. In his first full season Barnet were promoted as champions to Division Four, and reached the play-offs in 1991‚Äì92. He was then allowed to leave on a free transfer to Plymouth Argyle in the newly designated Second Division (third tier), where he captained the side. While at Plymouth he was involved in an incident which ended Rotherham United winger John Buckley's Football League career. Buckley was knocked unconscious in a clash of heads with Poole, requiring emergency surgery to remove a blood clot from the brain, and remained in a coma on life support for four days. Poole spent just one season at Plymouth before Fry brought him to Southend United of Division One for a club record fee of ¬£350,000. Another year later he joined up with Fry again, this time at Birmingham City, newly relegated to the third tier of English football, for a fee of ¬£50,000. Success followed in 1994‚Äì95 with the Second Division championship and victory in the Football League Trophy at Wembley. The next season Poole took over the captaincy after Liam Daish was sold to Coventry City, captaining the side in the League Cup semi-final against Leeds United. In the match against Manchester City at Maine Road in September 1996, referee Richard Poulain awarded a penalty late on; Poole, who had conceded the free kick which led to the penalty, lost control and pushed the referee from behind such that he needed treatment for whiplash after the game. The Football Association imposed an instant suspension on the player; after a hearing, the length of the ban was set at four matches. A month later manager Trevor Francis sold him to fellow First Division club Charlton Athletic for a fee of ¬£250,000. He played 16 games for Charlton that season, but a knee injury sustained in a reserve team match put an end to his first-team career. Still contracted to the club when they gained promotion to the Premier League the following season, he attempted a comeback in the reserves after more than a year out, but never appeared in the top flight and retired in August 1999. A qualified coach, he became a director of a company providing investment opportunities for sportspeople.

Once the largest prison in the Kingdom of Hungary, in the 20th century it became known for housing political prisoners under the communist regime, notably the future communist President of Czechoslovakia Gust√°v Hus√°k. After the dismantling of communism in 1989, Leopoldov Prison was the place of a series of violent revolts requiring intervention of highest- ranking government officials including Ministers and the Prime Minister, who personally conducted negotiations inside the prison. The building complex was damaged during the riots and in 1990, the Slovak parliament voted to close the prison down. However, it continues to serve until today. Leopoldov Prison was the place of the 1991 prison break, where a group of prisoners fought their way out, murdering several prison guards in the process.  History  A memory on Leopoldov's cemetery dedicated to graecocatholic bishop from Pre≈°ov Pavol Peter Gojdiƒç (died on 17 July 1960) and Metod Dominik Trƒçka who died in Leopoldov Prison on 23 March 1959. Construction of a fortress against Ottoman Turks started in 1665 and was finished in 1669, on the initiative of Leopold I,http://www.spsmvbr.cz/muzeumzla/leopoldov/leopoldov.html (Czech) after the Nov√© Z√°mky fortress fell to the Turks. The fortress was built in a star shape, with two entrance gates. During the reign of Maria Theresa of Austria, it was used as a military warehouse. After loss of military importance in the 19th century, it was rebuilt as a prison in 1855, with a capacity of around 1000 inmates, what was the biggest prison in the Kingdom of Hungary at that time. (Slovak) Since that time it is used as a prison continuously until present. During the Communist Czechoslovakia, the Communist government used the prison for holding and liquidating political prisoners, particularly in the 1950s. The conditions were harsh for prisoners, and the prison was one of the most notorious in the former Czechoslovakia.To the Memory of the Victims of the Political Trials Among the inmates was Gust√°v Hus√°k (from 1954 to 1960),http://www.osobnosti.sk/index.php?os=zivotopis&ID;=735 (Slovak) who would be later communist president of Czechoslovakia. The prison was modernized and reconstructed in the second half of the 20th century. Before 1989 there were approximately 2,600 inmates in the prison. As of 1990, it was the biggest prison in the present-day Slovakia.  Description  The Leopoldov Prison complex consists of a 267,651 meters squared area. It is divided into an administrative part, prisoner cellblocks and workshops. Some parts of the complex are protected as cultural and historical landmarks. The prison includes four general practitioner offices, one dentist's office, one psychiatrist's office and place for bedridden patients. Leopoldov Prison specializes in treating prisoners suffering from tuberculosis and diabetes and convicts in court-appointed protective anti-drug treatment (usually for alcoholism).  Prisoner revolts  In December 1989, shortly after the Velvet revolution a wave of unrest swept the Czechoslovak prisons. After a wide- ranging amnesty by president V√°clav Havel from January 1990, the prisoners in Leopoldov prison revolted. At this point there were approximately 2500 inmates in Leopoldov, including some 200 murderers, 170 rapists, 370 burglars and 320 thieves, most of them falling under the provisions of paragraph 41 about serious recidive thus not being the subject of the president's amnesty. About 552 prisoners were to be released but this process started gradually. Besides reconsidering their cases in face of the amnesty, revolting prisoners also demanded that many wardens compromised under the communist regime or brutal towards inmates be fired. First hunger-strikes and unrest in January were suppressed. On March 1, 1990 217 inmates barricaded themselves inside a structure called the Castle (sleeping rooms of the III. and IV. regiment). They managed to hold the object for some time, demolishing the furniture in the process, but this uprising was suppressed. On March 15, 1990, the prisoners started a revolt, resisting arrest for two weeks, barricading themselves and using iron rods, razors, petrol bombs and improvised flamethrowers as their weapons. The revolt climaxed on March 28, 1990 when hundreds of prisoners managed to set the roof of the Castle on fire. After the end of the revolt, the damage was estimated at 27 million Kƒçs and a big part of the prison was not habitable. In fact, the damage was so great that authorities seriously considered closing the whole prison down. The situation in Leopoldov prison remained tense, as many leaders of the previous revolts were still among the inmates, including Tibor Polg√°ri who took part in a famous prison break a year later. In November 1991, seven escapees from Leopoldov prison murdered five guards. After spending four hours fleeing Leopoldov prison, stealing several cars in the process, they managed to take a train which took them back to Leopoldov.  1999 murder  In the early hours of September 2, 1999 in cell no. 2 on the VI. regiment of Leopoldov prison Jozef V√≠gh from ƒåenkovice and Stanislav Zimmermann from Mal√° Lehota strangled their cellmate with a leather belt and laid his body in a way to suggest suicide. At that time, both men had already been serving a 15 and 17 year long sentences, respectively. They were both convicted of the murder and their sentences changed to life imprisonment.  Today  Although the Slovak National Council voted to close the prison in 1990, this decision was reversed in 1993. Today, the prison is used as a medium and high security prison, for 1,426 inmates. Some objects are protected as historical monuments.http://www.zvjs.sk/index.php?Lang=SK&m;=02-05-01 (Slovak)  Notable inmates  * Rudolf Beran - prime minister of Czechoslovakia * bl.

It was financed by Arthur Hyde Dendy, a local Paignton barrister and designed by George Soudon Bridgman.  History  The Paignton Pier Act received Royal Assent on 3 June 1874 and work commenced on its construction in October 1878 to the design of Bridgman. The pier, with its customary grand pavilion at the seaward end, was opened to the public for the first time in June 1879. The pier-head pavilion was home to many forms of entertainment including singing, dancing, recitals, music hall, and most famously Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera, re-titled HMS Pinafore on the water, performed by Mr D'Oyley's full company on 27 and 28 July 1880. In 1881 the pier-head was enlarged to facilitate the construction of a billiard room, adjoining the pavilion. On the death of Arthur Dendy Paignton Pier was purchased by the Devon Dock, Pier and Steamship Company, under whose ownership it became a regular stop for paddle steamers travelling between Torquay and Brixham. In 1919 the pier-head and its associated buildings were destroyed in a fire. These were never replaced and a period of decline followed. Sectioned as a defence measure in 1940, for fear of German invasion, the damaged neck was eventually repaired once hostilities had ceased. In 1980 the fortunes of Paignton Pier took a turn for the better when a major redevelopment project was undertaken. This included the widening of the shoreward end to ensure a uniform neck, and the construction of the rather stylish pavilions that remain today. Paignton Pier comprises an entrance building at the shoreward end along with what looks to be several individual pavilion buildings connected along the neck. These in fact form one single amusement arcade through their entire length. At the pier-head there is now an open amusement area containing karts, slides and a carousel.

Five of them operated only one or two baseball seasons and the other four seasons. Jointly they covered eleven baseball seasons from 1889 to 1941. The first two Michigan State Leagues, 1889-1890 and 1895, predated the establishment of present-day Minor League Baseball, an umbrella organization of minor leagues. The third was a \\"Class D\\" league during 1902 only, the first season for the organized minors. In 1911, the West Michigan League expanded and became the fourth Michigan State League as a \\"Class D\\" minor league through 1914. In 1926, the Michigan‚ÄìOntario League merged with the Central League to form the fifth MSL, which played only the one season. The sixth Michigan State League operated in 1940 and 1941.

He was a founding dean of the non- denominational rabbinical program at Hebrew College in Boston, where he still teaches. He describes himself as an American Jew who was educated entirely by the generation of immigrant Jewish intellectuals cast up on American shores by World War II.Tirosh-Samuelson, p. 195 Biography Arthur (Art) Green grew up in Newark, New Jersey in a nonobservant Jewish home and attended Camp Ramah. He describes his father as a \\"militant atheist,\\" but his mother, from a traditional family, felt obligated to give her son a Jewish education.Tirosh- Samuelson, p. 191‚Äì2 He was sent to a liberal Hebrew School in the congregation of Rabbi Joachim Prinz. Later he attended the synagogue of Max Gruenewald in Millburn, New Jersey. At Camp Ramah, his introductory Talmud teacher was Professor David Weiss-Halivni. Academic and rabbinic career In 1957, he began his studies at Brandeis University, where he went through a crisis of faith and sought new approaches to Judaism. It is there that he encountered mystical Judaism.Mayse, p. 3-5 Green's professors at Brandeis included Nahum Glatzer and Alexander Altmann. During his college years, he also met Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, who became a lifelong friend and mentor. After college, Green trained for the rabbinate at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, where he studied privately with Abraham Joshua Heschel.Mayse, p. 5-6 Green returned to Brandeis in 1967, earning his doctorate with Professor Altman. His dissertation became his book Tormented Master: The Life and Spiritual Quest of Rabbi Nahman of Bratslav. In 1968, Green founded Havurat Shalom, an experiment in Jewish communal life and learning that became the fountainhead of the Havurah movement in American Jewish life. Between 1973-1984, Green taught in the Religious Studies Department of the University of Pennsylvania.Mayse, p. 8-9 In 1984 he became dean, and then president, of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Philadelphia. In 1993, he was appointed Philip W. Lown professor of Jewish Thought at Brandeis, inheriting a chair that had been created for his mentor Professor Altmann. In 2003 he was invited to create a new non-denominational Rabbinical School at Hebrew College. Green has published both academic works on the intellectual history of Jewish mysticism and Hasidism, as well as writings of a more personal theological sort. Radical Judaism, said to be his most important theological work,Mayse, p. 21 was published by Yale University Press in 2010, based on a series of lectures he delivered at Yale University in the Fall of 2006. Green is also known as a translator and commentator of Hasidic sourcesMayse, p. 14-15 and is a key figure in the articulation of a Neo-Hasidic approach to Judaism. His two edited volumes (together with A. E. Mayse) A New Hasidism: Roots and Branches, is to appear in 2018, published by the Jewish Publication Society. Green's works have been translated into seven languages, including Hebrew. The Hebrew version of Tormented Master (Ba‚Äôal ha-Yissurim‚Äî◊ë◊¢◊ú ◊î◊ô◊°◊ï◊®◊ô◊ù) was an influential best-seller in Israel,Mayse, p. 48 where Green visits and lectures frequently.Mayse, p. 49 An expanded Hebrew version of Radical Judaism (◊ô◊î◊ì◊ï◊™ ◊®◊ì◊ô◊ß◊ú◊ô◊™: ◊§◊™◊ô◊ó◊™ ◊©◊¢◊® ◊ú◊û◊ë◊ß◊©◊ô ◊ì◊®◊ö) appeared in 2016.

History The original two-story building on the site was built in the late 18th or early 19th century. It served as a general store and post office, and was used for a time as a theater and later a movie house. Immediately to the east is a one-story concrete building built in 1904 to replace an earlier building that was destroyed by fire. Both structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as contributing properties to Taylorstown Historic District. Thomas Hickman and John Slater operated the store until 1899, at which point the partnership dissolved and the Hickmans took over. They saw the store through reconstruction before transferring ownership to the Mann family in 1938. Annie Elizabeth Mann served as proprietor until her death in 1976.

Prior to 1993 the Isle of Man's steam and electric railways were already established as tourism attractions and had put on special events previously such as the 1973 Steam Railway Centenary, the 1993 Year of Railways was used as an opportunity to promote the Island as a mecca for rail and engineering enthusiasts. Events Although 1993 was the centenary of the Manx Electric Railway, the events showcased all of the Islands railways and more with intensive activities during three periods. Each of the event periods commenced with \\"meet and greet\\" sessions held at Summerland, where organisers, directors, staff and other influential people from the railways were on hand. As well as outlining the event timetables, there were slideshows, question- and-answer sessions and general chat. The majority of the events were simple railway-based activities, although the opportunity was also taken to do things a little differently. They included: Trams at Laxey station during the celebration on 27 August 1993 * Parallel running of the two original tramcars dating from the opening of the line; this usually took place prior to daily services to facilitate use of both running lines * Use of a low loader to transfer No. 4 \\"Loch\\" of the Isle of Man Railway to Laxey where it ran a service pulling two MER trailers along a section to Dhoon Quarry * Tram 9 decorated by engineers from Blackpool to become illuminated; it ran shuttles to Groudle where the Groudle Glen Railway put on evening services * Tram Cavalcade at Laxey where every available tram, trailer, works vehicle and the steam engine performed a run by with a historic and trivia based commentary * Photo trams and trains ran which would stop at preselected scenic locations so that the passengers could alight, photograph and proceed to the next location * Chasing buses that shadowed special services to viewpoints and chased ahead to await the arrival of trains/trams, sometimes utilising vintage buses * Special tram services were featured that included running commentaries about the views and attractions along the length of the routes with stopping places * Floodlit evening photography and barbecues were held with staff creating shunting movements for the benefit of spectators, often with little-used rolling stock * Guided tours around sheds and depots which would normally be closed to members of the public, both in the day and in conjunction with evening sessions * Guided walks of the closed railway lines to Peel, Ramsey and Foxdale with connecting vintage buses and coaches between venues, and refreshments * Slide and film shows with a \\"bring your own along\\" policy ensuring a varied mix of entertainments, also including raffles and other attractions * Operation of the restored Upper Douglas Cable Car along the promenade at Douglas prior to the operation of usual horse tram services * Cavalcade line-ups of the horse tram fleet outside the workshops at Derby Castle, including some rarely used tramcars in service along the promenade * The return of \\"Polar Bear\\" to the Groudle Glen Railway for a month-long visit, including double headed trains, freight trains, and the like * Use of a low loader to return No. 4 \\"Loch\\" to Douglas, this time towed by steam road locomotives DUKE OF YORK, and ATLAS driven by Fred Dibnah. Organised by the staff and friends of the railways including local preservationist groups, and backed up by the island's Department of Tourism and Leisure, which own the railways, these events were hailed both on and off the island as a resounding success. Total visitor numbers for the events were estimated at 35,000, second only at attracting visitors behind the T.T. Races. The success of the year's events paved the way for a period of much interest in the island's railways over the next years, and this was reflected in the array of events between 1994 and 1998 culminating in the 125th anniversary of the railway. Subsequent festivals Following the success of the Year of Railways, the lines played host to similar events to celebrate other milestones in the histories of the island's railways. * 1994 100 years of tram services to Laxey. * 1995 The International Railway Festival marked the centenary of the Snaefell Mountain Railway. * 1996 for the centenary of the Groudle Glen Railway * 1998 Steam 125 marked 125 years of the Isle of Man Steam Railway from Douglas to Peel. There were also lower-key events in 1997 and 1999 for the centenary of tram services to Ramsey, but despite their smaller scale they were well attended by visitors. From 1999, although events still took place annually, they were held on a much smaller scale, usually over a weekend in July or August with fewer one-off events being held. They usually consisted of more straightforward events such as unusual tramcars in operation, double- headed trains, non-passenger vehicles in service. Events such as night photography, slide shows and such, were phased out. From 2009 the event has been renamed as the \\"Manx Heritage Transport Festival\\", and it is intended to hold the event annually over the same period in future: starting on the Wednesday of the last week in July and continuing until the following Tuesday, with events on all railways, and some non-rail events such as vintage bus tours, boat trips, and the like.

Its shares are traded on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange. The Issta Group' has over 60 branches throughout Israel, as well as call Centers and online travel services. The Group employs over 1000 permanent employees in Israel and abroad. In 2014 the Group had a turnover of approximately $650 million. History Issta is an acronym which stands for Israeli Student Travel Association, a name which reveals its initial purpose: a student exchange organization which began operating at the Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology in 1956. Issta's first commercial step was marketing discounted seats for students in Zim Integrated Shipping Services passenger ships (formerly ZIM Israel Navigation Company). In 1958 Issta began operating as an independent company owned by the Technion Student Body. At the same year Issta leased airplanes and began marketing cheaper flights to Athens, Greece. Issta continued functioning as a charter operator and cruise retailer and during the 1960s turned Athens Airport into its hub. Following the increase of incoming Student Travel and Volunteering in Israel during the 1960s, Issta began providing services for Incoming Tourism: Bus Tours around Israel, hostels, hotels and printed matter. Following a model outlined by the International Student Travel Confederation, Issta signed long- term contracts with various airlines and began marketing specially-priced seats for youth and students in regular flights. In the summer of 1978 Issta leased an aircraft from El Al for a season and operated student charter flights from Tel Aviv to European destinations. In the summer of 1979 Issta leased a 260-seat aircraft from Capitol Airlines and operated its first trans- Atlantic flight to New York. Later that summer Issta operated 2 weekly flights to New York in an aircraft leased from 'El Al Charter Services Ltd.' (later Sun d'Or International Airlines). In 1985 Issta joined the Israeli Travel Agent Association. In 1987 Issta owned eight branches and employed 120 workers. Its annual revenue reached $9 million and for the first time it granted scholarships for students. In 1989 Issta began launching branches in Israel's suburban and peripheral towns. Computerization of the company began in the late 1980s. Issta Direct Call Centre began operating as an informational telephone line in the beginning of the 1990s. In 1995 Issta's gross revenue reached $90 million. The company employed 300 workers in 20 branches. In May 1996 the company was issued in Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.

He was active in religious controversy prior to and around the time of the Commonwealth of England and The Protectorate, following the English Civil War. In the years from 1640 he was a particularly influential preacher. Early life Burges was descended from the Burges or Bruges family of Batcombe, Somerset, was probably born in 1589. He was a son of Robert Burges (d. 1626) of Stanton Drew, Somerset and Alice Benbrick. Burges had brothers James and John, who remained at Stanton Drew, and a sister Hester who married Samuel Sherman of Dedham, Essex. In 1611 he was entered at Oxford, but at what college is unknown. He was transferred to Wadham College, Oxford, and graduated B.A. on 5 July 1615, and thence migrated to Lincoln College, Oxford, of which he was a member when he graduated M.A. on 20 April 1618. He must have taken orders before graduation, if it be true that on 21 December 1613 he obtained the vicarage of Watford, Hertfordshire, on the presentation of Sir Charles Morison. On 16 January 1626 he was allowed to hold, along with Watford, the rectory of St. Magnus, London Bridge. This latter he resigned in 1641, his successor being admitted on 20 July. Soon after the accession of Charles I he was made one of the king's chaplains in ordinary, and on 16 June 1627 he was made B.D. and D.D. by his university. Wood represents him as being at this time a zealous son of the church, and as only taking to schismatical courses through the disappointment of his eagerness for preferment. Opposition to Laud Archbishop of Canterbury William Laud was an enemy of Burges. The Calvinistic views held by Burges are shown in his Baptismal Regeneration of Elect Infants, published at Oxford in 1629. A Latin sermon, preached in 1635 to the London clergy at St. Alphage's, London Wall, brought him before the Court of High Commission. In this discourse he had blamed the connivance of bishops at the growth of Arminianism and popery. The proceeding caused him trouble and expense, and deepened his hostility to the party of William Laud. He was accused of being 'a vexer of two parishes with continual suits of law'. This may mean that he resisted the demands of visitation articles in reference to ceremonial observance. An Oxford pamphlet of 1648 is Wood's authority for saying that he was 'looked upon by the high commission as one guilty of adultery'. It is plain that there was no evidence to substantiate the charge. The prestige of Burges steadily increased. Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick was his patron.Hugh Trevor-Roper, Religion, the Reformation and Social Change (1967), p. 298. 1640‚Äì1645 In September 1640 he conveyed to the king at York the petition of the London clergy against the 'etcetera oath', and succeeded in getting it dispensed with. Clarendon in his History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England goes so far as to say that the influence of Burges and Stephen Marshall was greater with both houses of parliament than that of Laud had ever been with the court, a statement which, as Edmund Calamy the Elder observes, 'carries a pretty strong figure in it'. The DNB comments that to link Burges and Marshall together, as though their views and policy were identical, is an error. Marshall was also a client of the Earl of Warwick. Christopher Hill, however, states that their fast sermons, delivered in succession on 17 November 1640, were clearly in concert.The English Bible and the Seventeenth-Century Revolution, p. 86. Hugh Trevor-RoperReligion, p. 297. comments that none of that day's arrangements were casual. Wood also puts Burges and Marshall at the head of those who preached in 1640, 'that for the cause of religion it was lawful for the subjects to take up arms against their lawful sovereign'. Burges came to the front rank of leaders on the ecclesiastical question in 1641, in connection with the effort made by the House of Lords for an accommodation of ecclesiastical differences. On 12 March the lords' 'committee for innovations' called in the assistance of a body of divines to take part in a sub-committee for examining alleged innovations in doctrine and discipline unlawfully introduced since the Reformation. Of seventeen divines who answered the summons six, headed by William Twisse, and including Burges, Marshall, and Calamy, constituted the section most opposed to the existing ecclesiastical system or its abuses. The four bishops and their friends on the sub-committee agreed to the proposed reformations; while, on the other hand, Twisse and his friends made no proposals antagonistic to episcopacy. The court party was stubborn against all concession; a growing party on the other side was for a more drastic treatment of episcopacy. The lords' attempt to find a modus vivendi was abandoned. In the commons a measure was introduced, still not attacking episcopacy as such, but for the suppression of deaneries and chapters. John Hacket, afterwards bishop of Coventry and Lichfield (a member of the sub-committee), was put forward on 12 May to defend the menaced corporations at the bar of the house. The house called for Burges to speak in reply to him, which he did on the same afternoon at an hour's notice. Hugh Trevor-RoperArchbishop Laud, p. 410 of the 2000 reprint. points out that this was the day of Strafford's execution. His speech is said to have contained invective; he shared the puritan objection to instrumental music in church services, and made a point of the dissoluteness of cathedral singing-men. At the close of his reply he gave it as his opinion that, while necessary to apply the cathedral foundations to better purposes, 'it was by no means lawful to alienate them from public and pious uses, or to convert them to any private person's profit'. This acknowledgement was afterwards turned against him, for he himself became a purchaser of alienated chapter lands. Burges declared that he had spoken in haste; his mature judgement was in favour of the right of the state to apply to its own purposes the lands which had been assigned for the support of offices since abolished. He had advanced ¬£3,500 to the parliament, and took the lands in payment. The date of his resignation of one of his livings should be noticed: he ceased to be a pluralist within two months of his speech against useless dignities. In the conflict with the king, Burges disclaimed altogether the attitude of rebellion, and his 'Vindication' proves his case. He sided with the parliament in consequence of the assurances conveyed in the 'propositions and orders' of both houses on 10 June 1642, viz. that any subsidies received by the parliament should be employed only in maintaining 'the Protestant religion, the king's authority, his person in his royal dignity, the free course of justice, the laws of the land, the peace of the kingdom, and the privileges of parliament, against any force which shall oppose them'. For a short time he was (according to Wood) chaplain to Essex's regiment of horse. Subsequent proceedings, at a time when the parliament was overridden by the army, he openly declared to be subversive of the fundamental constitution of the kingdom. Burges's name stands thirty-second on the list of Westminster Assembly divines appointed by the ordinance of 12 June 1643. Twisse was named in the ordinance as prolocutor. On 8 July the assembly appointed Burges one of the two assessors or vice-presidents,Journal of the Assembly of Divines, July 8, 1643 and as Twisse was in feeble health, and John White, the other assessor, had fits of gout, on Burges, 'a very active and sharpe man' (as Baillie calls him), fell a good deal of the duty of keeping the assembly in order, at least until the appointment of Charles Herle to succeed Twisse, who died 19 July 1646. Burges was also convener of one of the three committees into which the assembly divided itself at the beginning of its work. His liturgical knowledge (he had a fine collection of the various issues of the common prayer-book) may be traced, Alexander Ferrier Mitchell thinks, in the composition of the 'Directory'. Burges was one of the few who, in 1643, opposed the imposition of the Solemn League and Covenant, and he carried his opposition so far as to petition the House of Commons to be heard against it. He was not anxious to create an irreparable breach with the episcopal party. John Lightfoot on this occasion abused Burges as 'a wretch to be branded to all posterity, seeking for some devilish ends, either of his own or others, or both, to hinder so great a good of the two nations'. The commons on 2 September suspended Burges from the assembly as a 'turbulent doctor', and would not readmit him till on 15 September he had made his humble apology. However, the covenant was not signed until a clause had been inserted, limiting the sort of 'prelacy' against which it was aimed, so that the 'advocates of a reformed episcopacy could swallow it'. Having once taken the covenant, Burges revered its binding obligation, and could never be prevailed upon to renounce it. Four shillings a day was assigned by the ordinance to each assembly-man; but the allowance was paid in irregular driblets, and Burges was one of those who declined their share, that the poorer members might come somewhat better off. On 12 March 1644 he was appointed (on the petition of the common councillors of London, December 1643) lecturer at St.Paul's, with a pension of ¬£400 a year, and the dean's house as a residence. On 6 February 1645 he was ordered to give up Watford and Philip Goodwin succeeded him. Opposition to Cromwell Later Burges was to shift positions. Around 1645-6, according to Trevor-Roper,Religion, p. 323. the new kind of radical preacher exemplified by Hugh Peter becomes prominent, and Burges was in the group dropping away from the close supporters of Oliver Cromwell. He joined the Presbyterian wing of the opposition.Religion, p. 338. The Vindication of the Ministers of the Gospel in and about London was drawn up by Burges in January 1649, and subscribed to by fifty-six other ministers who followed his lead. When King Charles was brought to trial, Burges was the foremost, at great personal risk, in protesting against the proceeding with his usual freedom and vigour. On 14 January 1649, the day preceding that on which the king was brought from Windsor to be arraigned before the high court of justice, Burges preached at Mercers' Chapel, denouncing the measure in the strongest terms. He and his friends had taken up the cause of the parliament, as he declared in the 'Vindication', published while the trial was in progress, 'not to bring his majesty to justice (as some now speak), but to put him in a better capacity to do justice'. Later life When King Charles II of England was restored to the throne, Burges was ruined. About 1650 Burges obtained an appointment at Wells as preacher in the cathedral. In July 1656 there was a warm dispute about his exclusive right to officiate there. Burges objected to an arrangement by which the inhabitants of St. Cuthbert's parish were to hold their services in the cathedral. The ground of his objection does not appear; Stoughton conjectures that the other congregation was of the independent sort. His preaching was unwelcome. The citizens walked up and down the cloisters all sermon-time, and the constables had to be called in. About this time Burges invested his property in the purchase of alienated church lands, including the manor of Wells and the deanery which he rebuilt. He is said to have behaved with great rapacity, to have stripped the lead from the cathedral, to have used the proceeds to enlarge the deanery in which he lived, and to have let out the gate-houses as cottages. At the Restoration his investment (for which he had been offered over ¬£12,000 in the previous year) was taken from him without recompense. Hence he was reduced to want, his pension was gone, he was suffering from cancer in the neck and cheek. He still had a house at Watford, and there he lived, attending the church in which he had formerly preached; he was compelled to part with his library for bread. He made application to Sir Richard Browne, Lord Mayor of London in 1660, who promised to provide for him if he would preach a recantation sermon in St. Paul's, and on his refusal flung him a gratuity of ¬£3. Calamy describes him as ejected from St. Andrew's, Wells (which is the cathedral); this must have taken place before the Act of Uniformity. He was a worn-out man, yet, but for his maladies, he might have kept his old lead. It was his hand that drew up the 'Reasons' of the country ministers desiring reforms in the church at the Restoration, to which the authorities turned a deaf ear. He died at Watford, where he was buried in the church on 9 June 1665. He was married and left a son. By his will, dated Watford, 16 May 1665, he bequeathed his collection of prayer-books, the sole treasures saved from his library, to his 'dear and much-honoured mother, the renowned university of Oxford'. Assessments The opposite writers speak of him with a bitterness which may be explained by his proceedings at Wells. Wood gloats over his miseries, Echard and Zachary Grey load his memory with reproaches. There was a spice of the demagogue in his temper; he had the popular ear, and liked leadership. Yet in ecclesiastical politics he was for moderate measures; in civil affairs he stood as the consistent advocate of constitutional freedom.

He pitched for the Brooklyn Dodgers and Chicago Cubs. Pressnell had to wait until age 31 to make his Major League debut, but it was an impressive one. In the third game of the 1938 season for Brooklyn, he pitched a complete-game shutout against the Philadelphia Phillies, scattering nine hits as the Dodgers won 9‚Äì0 in a snappy 1 hour, 53 minutes. On June 15 of that year, Pressnell participated in a history-making game. He pitched in relief on that date for Brooklyn in the first night game of Ebbets Field's history, while Johnny Vander Meer of the visiting Cincinnati Reds that night pitched his second consecutive no-hitter, a feat that has not been duplicated in Major League Baseball. Pressnell went on to a record of 11‚Äì14, the most victories he would have in a single season. In his nine previous minor-league seasons, Pressnell won 111 games, including one season split between the Wichita Falls Spudders and Longview Cannibals. Pressnell married Ruth Herge (died 1956) in 1931 and Helen Freese Cramer (died 1997) in 1959. After retirement he worked for Ohio Oil, the precessor to Marathon Oil. He died in the city of his birth, Findlay, Ohio, on January 6, 2001, aged 94.

It is the remains of the former Sarawak Mangrove Forest Reserve which covered 170 km2. Located 30 km from Kuching, the Wetlands National Park was gazetted in 1992 and covers an area of 66.1 km2 on the estuarine reaches of the Sibu Laut and Salak rivers. The park is composed of coastal, marine and freshwater ecosystems. The predominantly saline and deltaic mangrove system includes an extensive network of marine waterways and tidal creeks, formed by the interconnecting rivers of Sungei Sibu-Laut, Batang Salak and Sungei Santubong that form the boundary of the park. Some small patches of heath forest are found within the park. Biodiversity The park is the home of at least three predominantly arboreal primates; the endangered proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus), the long-tailed macaques and the silvered langurs. White- bellied sea eagles, mudskippers and horseshoe crabs are also present. Otters and the Irrawaddy dolphins can also be sighted. On nearby Mount Santubong, hornbills can be seen. Historical Interest In the 12th Century the area was an important trading post between the interior peoples for their jungle produce predominantly animal parts valuable in Chinese medicine traded with the Chinese for their pottery and earthenwares. Past and existing excavations have unearthed remains of the former Iron smelting industries active hundreds of years past. The Impressive Mt. Santubong acted as a clear navigational point for these traders no doubt. Future Many jobs depend upon this habitat for the rich abundance of fish that are spawned and grow amongst the protection of the root systems. Timber is extracted for construction and several charcoal factories. The tourism industry is starting to grow offering wildlife cruises. The heavy decline in the proboscis monkey population caused by hunting, was largely arrested by the educational efforts of the Sarawak Forestry department protecting and banning the trade of these animals. Mangroves serve as important coastal defences absorbing strong waves and reputably up to 95% of the waves energy in extreme cases, such as a tsunami or king tide limiting damage. This attribute alone should be cause to justify their existence. Extensive development predominantly housing but including quarrying and retail premises is occurring outside the parks boundary. These habitats are used by the many animals found in the park, thus increasing the pressure on this small reserve. As future development increases surrounding the park the existing gene pool will have to suffice since breeding between animals outside the park will no longer be possible. Conservation One suggestion is to: Protect a corridor/strip of land from development for the purpose of migration and breeding of animal species between other nearby habitats. Implementation would be possible with government intervention since existing routes are still currently feasible i.e. some undeveloped tracts still exist. Kuching wetlands N. P. is only about 20 km from Bako National Park which is well catered for receiving visitors. See also * List of national parks of Malaysia References * Beavitt, W. & Tuen.A.A (2010).

The school was built in 1971 and opened by Prince William of Gloucester whose family home, Barnwell Manor, is a few miles away. Prince William was killed in an air crash soon after the school opened.. Having opened as Oundle Upper School, it was decided to rename in honour of the Prince who had opened the school just months earlier. In 2012, the current Duke of Gloucester, Prince Richard, commemorated the 40th anniversary of the school when he revealed a plaque and toured the school with students and staff. In 2015, the school reopened as an academy. It is now part of the East Midlands Academy Trust. Following local transition to a two-tier school system in 2015 the school provides education from year 7 all the way through to sixth form. The school serves as the main secondary school for much of East Northamptonshire with children coming from various villages and schools, the biggest feeder schools being Thrapston Primary School and Oundle CofE Primary School. In July 2016, the longest serving teacher of Prince William School, Graham Snelling, retired from the school after 41 years. A 2017 Ofsted report rated the school as 'Requires Improvement'. In January 2020, Ofsted's report upgraded the school to a 'Good' rating. Departments Prince William School itself is broken into different specialized blocks: The Sutton Maths Department.

It comprises three series and is published by Blackwell Publishing for the Royal Statistical Society.  History  The Statistical Society of London was founded in 1834, but would not begin producing a journal for four years. From 1834‚Äì1837, members of the society would read the results of their studies to the other members, and some details were recorded in the proceedings. The first study reported to the society in 1834 was a simple survey of the occupations of people in Manchester, England. Conducted by going door-to-door and inquiring, the study revealed that the most common profession was mill-hands, followed closely by weavers. When founded, the membership of the Statistical Society of London overlapped almost completely with the statistical section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1837 a volume of Transactions of the Statistical Society of London were written, and in May 1838 the society began its journal. The first editor-in- chief of the journal was Rawson W. Rawson. In the early days of the society and the journal, there was dispute over whether or not opinions should be expressed, or merely the numbers. The symbol of the society was a wheatsheaf, representing a bundle of facts, and the motto Aliis exterendum, Latin for \\"to be threshed out by others.\\" Many early members chafed under this prohibition, and in 1857 the motto was dropped. From 1838‚Äì1886, the journal was published as the Journal of the Statistical Society of London (). In 1887 it was renamed the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society () when the society was granted a Royal Charter. On its centenary in 1934, the society inaugurated a Supplement to the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society to publish work on industrial and agricultural applications.J. Aldrich (2010) Mathematics in the London/Royal Statistical Society 1834-1934, Electronic Journ@l for History of Probability and Statistics, 6, (1). In 1948 the society reorganised its journals and the main journal became the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A (General) () and the supplement became Series B (Statistical Methodology). In 1988, Series A changed its name to Series A (Statistics in Society). In 1952, the society founded Applied Statistics of the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society which became Series C (Applied Statistics). After merging with the Institute of Statisticians in 1993, the society published Series D (The Statistician) (), but this journal was closed in 2003, to be replaced by Significance.  Discussion papers  Traditionally papers were presented at ordinary meetings of the society and those present, whether fellows or not, were invited to comment on the presentation. The paper and subsequent discussion would then be published in the journal. This followed a format used by other scientific societies of the time, such as the Royal Society. This practice continues although papers are selected for reading and go through peer review before being presented. It is considered a significant recognition to be invited to present a paper at an ordinary meeting of the society. This selection is currently done by the research section of the society for Series B and by an appointed editor for Series A&C.; Papers are selected to be of importance and wide interest in terms of application or applicability. Any person is invited to attend discussion meetings and contribute to the discussion although they are limited to 5 minutes speaking time. Following the formal presentation of the paper, two speakers are invited to comment by prior arrangement. Formally they are there to propose and second the 'vote of thanks' and would have respectively praised and criticised the presentation. Contributions to the discussion are not peer reviewed but are limited to 400 words in the journal.  Current series  As of 2009, three series are published under this general title.

In K≈çshin belief, it represents the control of the playful and desire-driven creature everyone has inside his body. The folk faith says that to have a wish granted, you must sacrifice one desire. If you put your desire inside one of the color balls that represent the monkey Kukurizaru, K≈çshin will help you to make that desire vanish and because desires are what keep wishes from coming true, your wish will be granted and you will also become a better person. It is also said that when you feel a desire coming you must put your hands together and recite the Buddhist sutra: On deiba yakisya banta banta kakakaka sowaka.

Sitz, 496 U.S. 444 (1990), was a United States Supreme Court case involving the constitutionality of police sobriety checkpoints. The Court held 6-3 that these checkpoints met the Fourth Amendment standard of \\"reasonable search and seizure.\\" Background In the state of Michigan, the state police adopted the practice of using random sobriety checkpoints to catch drunk drivers. A group of Michigan residents sued on the grounds that their Fourth Amendment rights prohibiting unreasonable search and seizure were being violated. As the dissenting opinion by Justice Stevens explains, \\"a sobriety checkpoint is usually operated at night at an unannounced location. Surprise is crucial to its method. The test operation conducted by the Michigan State Police and the Saginaw County Sheriff's Department began shortly after midnight and lasted until about 1 a.m. During that period, the 19 officers participating in the operation made two arrests and stopped and questioned 124 other unsuspecting and innocent drivers\\" During the operation, drivers would be stopped and briefly questioned while in their vehicles. If an officer suspected the driver was intoxicated, the driver would be sent off for a field sobriety test. Holding The Supreme Court held that Michigan had a \\"substantial government interest\\" to advance in stopping drunk driving, and that this technique was rationally related to achieving that goal (though there was some evidence to the contrary). The Court also held that the impact on drivers, such as in delaying them from reaching their destination, was negligible, and that the brief questioning to gain \\"reasonable suspicion\\" similarly had a negligible impact on the drivers' Fourth Amendment right from unreasonable search (implying that any more detailed or invasive searches would be treated differently). Applying a balancing test, then, the Court found that the Constitutionality of the search tilted in favor of the government. See also * Illinois v. Lidster (2004) * United States v.

History and profile El Debate was founded in 1910 by Guillermo de Rivas during the controversy originated by the so-called Padlock Bill, against the establishment of any more religious orders in Spain. It suffered a very unsuccessful management during its first months and it was sold to √Ångel Herrera Oria and his Asociaci√≥n Cat√≥lica Nacional de Propagandistas (ACNdP). Herrera Oria edited the newspaper from 1911 to 1933. Its headquarters was in Madrid. Ideologically, El Debate was very conservative and clerical, and journalistically it was very modern. The paper imported journalistic techniques from the United States and in 1926 opened the first Journalism School of Spain. It was the first newspaper with specific sport information. During the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923‚Äì1930) El Debate supported the previous censorship in order to protect religious, moral and juridical values. When the Second Republic was proclaimed, the newspaper declared its compliance to the new regime, although this annoyed of many of its monarchist readers. During the Second Republic (1931‚Äì1936) the government suspended its activity several times. The paper supported the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA), the rightist and possibilist coalition that won election in 1933.

During late Antiquity, it was one of the major commercial, agricultural, religious and intellectual areas of the empire, and its strategic location facing the Sassanid Empire and the unruly desert tribes gave it exceptional military importance. History The capital of the diocese was at Antioch, and its governor had the special title of comes Orientis (\\"Count of the East\\", of the rank vir spectabilis and later vir gloriosus) instead of the ordinary \\"vicarius\\". The diocese was established after the reforms of Diocletian (r. 284‚Äì305), and was subordinate to the praetorian prefecture of the East. The diocese included originally all Middle Eastern provinces of the Empire: Isauria, Cilicia, Cyprus, Euphratensis, Mesopotamia, Osroene, Syria Coele, Phoenice, Palaestina Prima, Palaestina Secunda, Arabia, and the Egyptian provinces Aegyptus, Augustamnica, Thebais, Libya Superior and Libya Inferior, which were grouped into the separate Diocese of Egypt under Valens (r. 364‚Äì378). During the course of the 4th century, several provinces were split, resulting in the new provinces of Cilicia I and Cilicia II, Syria I and Syria II Salutaris, Phoenice I and Phoenice II Libanensis (east of Mt. Lebanon), Palaestina I, Palaestina II and Palaestina Salutaris (or Palaestina III). The last creation of a new province dated in the reign of Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565), when Theodorias, the region around Laodicea, was split off from Syria I. At about the same time, Cyprus was split off and became part of a new super-province, the quaestura exercitus. In 535, as part of his administrative reforms, Justinian I abolished the diocese, and the comes Orientis became the provincial governor of Syria I, while retaining his previous rank of vir spectabilis and his salary. The entire area of the former diocese came under Sassanid Persian occupation in the 610s and 620s, during the Byzantine‚ÄìSassanid War of 602‚Äì628. Shortly after the Byzantine victory in the war and the recovery of the region, it was again lost, this time permanently, to the Muslim conquests: by the 640s, Cilicia formed the border between Byzantium and the new Arab Caliphate, while Cyprus became a disputed territory. From the old provinces of the Diocese of the East, only Isauria and parts of the two Cilicias remained under Byzantine rule, grouped under the new Anatolic Theme.

Eugenio Cambaceres (1843-1888) was an Argentine writer and politician. In the 1880s he wrote four books, with Sin rumbo (1885) being his masterpiece. His promising literary career was cut short when he died of tuberculosis.  Biography  Cambaceres was born and died in Buenos Aires. He was the son of a French chemist father who immigrated to Argentina in 1833 and a mother native to Buenos Aires. Cambaceres went to secondary school at the Colegio Nacional Central and then went on to receive a law degree from the Universidad de Buenos Aires. Biography Quickly launching into politics, he was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies and was named secretary of the Club del Progreso in 1870, and in 1873 became Vice President of said organization. However, his denunciations of fraud within his own party led to his downfall, and although he was re-elected to the legislature in 1876 he soon resigned his post and left public life to devote himself to literature. From his career as a liberal politician, perhaps his most important contribution was a controversial tract in a local magazine advocating the separation of Church and State that was quite polemic at the time. As a writer, he combined the naturalism of √âmile Zola and the Goncourt brothers and a localized realist character with four novels of a pessimistic nature. His first two novels were Pot-pourri (1881) and M√∫sica sentimental: Silbidos de un vago [Sentimental Music: Whistles of a Lazy Man] (1884). Both lack a precise plot and leave many threads hanging, containing stories of adultery within a pessimistic and weary atmosphere. The novelty of dealing with such a lurid topic and in such a crude manner provoked a scandalous repercussion and critics did not hesitate in directly attacking Cambaceres. This changed the composition and style of his later works, which were much better received. In 1885 he released his most significant novel, Sin Rumbo [Without Direction], where he offered good descriptions of the landscape of sexual pathology, including interesting anecdotes. The year before he died 1887, he published En la sangre (In the Blood), a story about the son of Italian immigrants of humble origin that advances his social standing by marrying the daughter of a wealthy estate, only to squander his fortune and end up with a miserable life. Through his writing, Cambaceres dealt with the problems associated with the arrival of Immigrants to Argentina and the social changes of his time, but ended up taking the perspective of the high bourgeoisie that critiqued the lower classes and European immigration. Eugenio Cambaceres traveled to Europe and was in Paris when he died at 45 years of age, in 1888. His daughter, Rufina Cambaceres, was only four years old.

The instrument The SWAI consists of 59 items that provide six subscale scores: excessive daytime sleepiness, nocturnal sleep, ability to relax, energy level, social desirability, and psychic distress. Each item is rated on a 1 to 9 semicontinuous Likert type scale from \\"always\\" to \\"never\\", based on the previous seven days. The SWAI was normed on 554 subjects in the early 1990s and is currently being validated or has been validated in multiple languages, including Spanish, French and Dutch. For the excessive daytime sleepiness subscale (SWAI-EDS), a score of 40 or below indicates excessive sleepiness, a score of between 40 and 50 indicates possible sleepiness and a score of greater than 50 is normal. A short form of the SWAI exists that contains items for the excessive daytime sleepiness and nocturnal sleep subscales only. Comparison with other sleepiness assessments The SWAI has been compared to the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), which is an objective measure that is considered the gold standard of sleepiness assessment; it measures sleep onset latency during several daytime opportunities. The SWAI-EDS has been found to correlate moderately to highly with average MSLT scores. Other sleepiness scales, including the Stanford sleepiness scale and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), exist. However, the ESS does not correlate as highly with the MSLT as the SWAI. The ESS is currently the most prevalent measure of excessive sleepiness. History The SWAI was developed by Drs.

In the late 1980s, she gained international attention as the first Western woman to be named a reincarnated lama. She continues to serve as Spiritual Director for Kunzang Odsal Palyul Changchub Choling, a Buddhist center in Poolesville, Maryland, which includes one of the largest communities of Western monks and nuns in North America. She went on to found a center in Sedona, Arizona, U.S.A.Kunzang Palyul Ch√∂ling Jetsunma has been described by her own teachers, as well as many other Tibetan Buddhist lamas who have visited her temple, as a dakini or female wisdom being.Zangpo, Ven.

A Garland of Immortal Wish-fulfilling Trees: The Palyul Tradition of the Nyingmapa, Snow Lion Publications, pg 186  Biography = Early years  Zeoli was born in Canarsie, Brooklyn on October 12, 1949, to an Austrian/Dutch Jewish mother and Italian father. She and her half-brothers and sisters were raised by her stepfather and mother, and alternately attended the Dutch Reform Church and the Catholic church.Mackenzie, pg 59 The family moved to Hialeah, Florida when she was 14.Sherrill, The Buddha From Brooklyn, pg 40 Her stepfather was an alcoholic and physically abusive towards the children, and Zeoli tried unsuccessfully to run away at age 17. After high school, she married Jim Perry and gave birth to her first son, Ben. The marriage ended in divorce and she moved to a farm outside Asheville, North Carolina with Pat Mulloy.Mackenzie, Reborn in the West, p. 61 They married and she had another son, Christopher.Sherrill, The Buddha From Brooklyn, pg 38-44 Zeoli adopted her daughter, Atira, years later in 1988. Based on a series of instructive dreams since she was 19, Zeoli began a meditation practice, later identified as chod by HH Penor Rinpoche, culminating in a spiritual experience at age 30.Mackenzie, Reborn in the West, p. 61-5 She studied with a New Age teacher named Jim Gore and led classes at the Black Mountain Light Center in North Carolina.Blythe, pg 111 Sherrill, The Buddha From Brooklyn, pg 44 In 1980, she met Michael Burroughs, a graduate student in religions at the University of Virginia and separated from Malloy in 1981.Sherrill, The Buddha From Brooklyn, pg 49 Zeoli moved with Burroughs and her son Christopher to Kensington, Maryland. She married Burroughs in 1983 and changed her name to Catharine. Together they formed the Center For Discovery and New Life beginning with former members from the Black Mountain Light Center. She gave channeled teachings, specifically a three-year cycle of teachings called the Santu SeriesSherrill, The Buddha From Brooklyn, pg 54Sherrill, The Buddha From Brooklyn, pg 91Pico Iyer, \\"The Price of Faith,\\" Tricycle: The Buddhist Review, Summer 2000, pg 81Encyclopedia of Women and religion in North America, Indiana University Press Her group quickly expanded, with the students practicing the meditation techniques Zeoli herself practiced from her dreams, a Light Expansion Prayer, and taking vows of compassion that Zeoli composed. The group began a 24-hour prayer vigil in the basement of their Kensington home in April, 1985Sherrill, The Buddha From Brooklyn, pg 55 inspired by her experiences when she searched for a place to pray and found locked doors.  Meeting her root guru  In 1984, Zeoli's growing group of students met a Tibetan man named Kunzang, Penor Rinpoche's main lay attendant, who was selling rugs to support Namdroling Monastery. The students sponsored seventy Namdroling monks. A few months later, Penor Rinpoche stayed with the Burroughs on his first visit to the US. During that week, he interviewed most of Jetsunma's students, as well as Jetsunma herself, about what was being taught and what they were practicing.Sherrill, The Buddha From Brooklyn, pg 57 The students asked him what their missions were to help the world. He concluded that Zeoli had been teaching Mahayana Buddhism without any formal instruction and attributed it to a very high level of practice accomplished in previous lifetimes.Sherrill, The Buddha From Brooklyn, pg 57-8Mackenzie, Reborn in the West, p. 72 Penor Rinpoche then gave Jetsunma's students the traditional refuge and bodhisattva vows, which constitute formal entry into the Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhist paths, respectively.What is Enlightenment magazine, Fall-Winter 1999Sherrill, The Buddha From Brooklyn, pg 58 Rinpoche visited the meditation and prayer center operated by the Burroughs, which at the time was nonsectarian rather than Buddhist. Thereafter Zeoli continued the channeled teachings, but they took on a more Buddhist flavor as the center hosted Khenpo Palden Sherab and Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal and she and her students began traditional Buddhist preliminary practice, ng√∂ndro. Beset by health problems, she made a trip in 1986 to Ashland, Oregon to visit Gyatrul Rinpoche, one of Penor Rinpoche's other hosts on his American tour the previous year. She formed a strong and immediate connectionSherrill, The Buddha From Brooklyn, pg 107 with Gyatrul Rinpoche, himself recognized as an incarnation of Palyul Monastery's founder, Rigdzin Kunzang Sherab (1636-1699).Ven. Gyatrul Rinpoche Gyatrul Rinpoche echoed the sentiment that the practices and teachings that naturally arose in Zeoli's mind were due to many past lifetimes as a lama, and encouraged her to visit Penor Rinpoche in India to investigate the matter further.Sherrill, The Buddha From Brooklyn, pg 107-8  Transmissions  At the age of 37, Jetsunma began the sequence of Buddhist practices that most tulkus begin very young. She was given the Nam Cho Ng√∂ndro by Gyaltrul Rinpoche in 1986, accumulating prostrations alongside her students. A year later, she was given the Three Roots from Penor Rinpoche at Namdroling monastery in India. She received the Rinchen Terzod, Nam Cho Tsa Lung, Nyingthik Yabshi, Ratna Lingpa, Dudjom Tersar, Yeshe Lama, and Nam Cho cycle of empowerments, which were hosted at Kunzang Palyul Choling from 1988 through 1996. She received the Kama transmission at Tashi Choling in Ashland, Oregon, in 1988, and the Nam Cho a second time from Karma Kuchen in McDonough, New York, in 2018.  Expansion  In 1985, the Center for Discovery and New Life formed a corporation and purchased an antebellum style mansion in Poolesville, Maryland where the Kunzang Palyul Choling temple was established. They also purchased numerous large crystalsCrystals at Jetsunma's center in Maryland weighing hundreds of pounds and held a three-day retreat to instate the 24-hour prayer vigil at the new location.Nyingma.com. Kunzang Palyul Ch√∂ling, Feb 16, 2007 Participants have maintained two-hour prayer shifts.Iyer, pg 84 The vigil is dedicated to the end of suffering and has remained unbroken,Sherrill, Martha. \\"Tough Town, Sad Times. So Why Are These People Smiling?\\" The Washington Post, May 17, 1995 In 1999, Kunzang Palyul Choling (KPC) began another 24-hour prayer vigil shortly after Alyce established the Sedona, Arizona location. The temple built a 36' stupa in 1988 which was consecrated by H.H. Penor Rinpoche during the Rinchen Terzod. A circle of eight small stupas encircling an 18' stupa were built in 1991 and consecrated by Khenchen Tsewang Gyatso. H.H. Penor Rinpoche gave Jetsunma a relic from Tulku Migyur Dorje to be housed in the Migyur Dorje Stupa, which was built and consecrated in 1996. In 1996, in addition to the temple, prayer vigil, teachings and stupas, Jetsunma's vision for Kunzang Palyul Choling included a place for pilgrimage with a hospice, school for children, a monastery and an institute for higher education in the Buddha's teachings.Mackenzie, pg 87 The school, called Pema Choling, ran from 1992 to 1997, and the Migyur Dorje Institute continued from 1996 through 2001. The temple has been partially closed to indoor activities since 2013, awaiting necessary renovations to comply with Montgomery County's Building Use and Occupancy Code. The prayer room, which is separate from the main building, remains open and houses all teachings and activities, and the prayer vigil remains undaunted. The organization raised $1 million for the building of the new temple as of February 18, 2019.

He received it from both Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche (1910‚Äì91), the then Supreme Head of the Nyingma tradition who was on a teaching visit to Namdroling at the time, and the most senior Palyul tulku, the Second Dzongnang Jampal Lodro Rinpoche (d. 8/87).\\"Statement by H.H. Penor Rinpoche Regarding the Recognition of Steven Seagal as a Reincarnation of the Treasure Revealer Chungdrag Dorje of Palyul Monastery\\" The Buddha From Brooklyn asserts that the students determine what title they will use for their own teacher and that Zeoli's ex-husband, Michael Burroughs, selected the title 'Jetsunma' for her. This is a title rarely given to even the most revered Tibetan Buddhist women teachers.Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America, Indiana University Press  Predecessor  The first Genyenma Ahkon Lhamo, a meditator recognized as a primordial wisdom dakini was one of the main disciples of Namch√∂ Mingyur Dorje (1645‚Äì67) and sister of Rigdzin Kunzang Sherab, Migyur Dorje's Dharma heirZangpo. A Garland of Immortal Wish-fulfilling Trees: The Palyul Tradition of the Nyingmapa, pg 62 and the First Throneholder of Palyul Monastery (founded 1665).[8] She is remembered both as being instrumental in the founding of Palyul (now one of the Nyingma's six main or \\"mother\\" monasteriesZangpo. A Garland of Immortal Wish-fulfilling Trees: The Palyul Tradition of the Nyingmapa, pg 9) and for leaving an extraordinary relic. During the cremation of her body, her kapala (top half of the skull) is said to have flown three kilometers and come to rest at the foot of the teaching throne of her brother. Found to be miraculously embossed with the sacred syllable AH, the kapala became one of the most treasured relics at Palyul monastery. Penor Rinpoche has recounted how, as a young tulku in Tibet (he was recognized and brought to Palyul Monastery in 1936, at the age of four),Zangpo. A Garland of Immortal Wish- fulfilling Trees: The Palyul Tradition of the Nyingmapa, pg 121 inspired by seeing the skull relic, he made prayers to find Ahkon Lhamo's incarnation.Sherrill. The Buddha From Brooklyn, pg 135 Though most of the kapala relic was pulverized into dust during the Cultural Revolution, one Tibetan man managed to save the silver dollar-size piece on which the syllable \\"AH\\" appears. Penor Rinpoche acquired it from him on a return trip to Tibet in 1987. He had it preserved in a crystal lotus and presented it to Jetsunma just prior to the occasion of her enthronement ceremony at Kunzang Palyul Choling (KPC) in 1988.Mackenzie, Vicki. \\"Reborn in the West\\" Marlowe & Company 1996 1st ed, pg 76 The relic remains at KPC and is displayed on auspicious days.  Mandarava emanation  In 1994, Terton Orgyen Kusum Lingpa indicated in a long life prayer he composed that Jetsunma was an emanation of Lhacham Mandarava, the Indian princess of Zahor and one of the consorts of Padmasambhava, a tantric master who helped establish the Buddha's teaching in Tibet.Sherrill, Martha. \\"The Buddha from Poolesville,\\" Washington Post, Apr 16, 2000Johnson, Allie. \\"Trouble in Shangri-La,\\" Kansas City - News, Apr 22, 2004 In 1996, she traveled to India and visited many of the places where Mandarava was known to have practiced.Sherrill, The Buddha From Brooklyn, pg 313 Inspired by these events, several of Jetsunma's students sought out and found a copy of Mandarava's middle-length spiritual biography, revealed as a terma in the 17th century by Samten Lingpa, at the U.S. Library of Congress.

Sprague de Camp, Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy, Arkham House, 1976, p. 40 It was first published in hardcover by Reeves and Turner in 1889.Eugene D. LeMire, A Bibliography of William Morris, New Castle, Del. , Oak Knoll Press, 2006, pp. 127-133 The book influenced J. R. R. Tolkien's popular The Lord of the Rings. Context This work and its successor, The Roots of the Mountains, were to some degree historical novels, with little or no magic. Morris would go on to develop the new genre established in this work in such later fantasies as Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair, The Wood Beyond the World, The Well at the World's End, and The Water of the Wondrous Isles.L. Sprague de Camp, Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy, Arkham House, 1976, pp. 42-5 Plot The House of the Wolfings is a romantically reconstructed portrait of the lives of the Germanic Gothic tribes, written in an archaic style and incorporating a large amount of poetry. Morris combines his own idealistic views with what was actually known at the time of his subjects' folkways and language. He portrays them as simple and hardworking, galvanized into heroic action to defend their families and liberty by the attacks of imperial Rome. Morris's Goths inhabit an area called the Mark on a river in the forest of Mirkwood, divided into the Upper-mark, the Mid-mark and the Nether-mark. They worship their gods Odin and Tyr by sacrificing horses, and rely on seers who foretell the future and serve as psychic news-gatherers. The men of the Mark choose two War Dukes to lead them against their enemies, one each from the House of the Wolfings and the House of the Laxings. The Wolfing war leader is Thiodolf, a man of mysterious and perhaps divine antecedents, whose ability to lead is threatened by his possession of a magnificent dwarf-made mail-shirt which, unknown to him, is cursed. He is supported by his lover the Wood Sun and their daughter the Hall Sun, who are related to the gods. Reception The Atlantic Monthly, reviewing the book in 1890, wrote that in it Morris \\"employs a very perfect art\\", commenting that the \\"saga\\" has a \\"varied character\\" and is \\"a story after the poet's own heart, and that in it wide scope is given for the special traits of his genius\\". The reviewer explains that \\"The larger portion is prose, but the speeches are usually given in verse\\", while the prose is in a \\"peculiar and artificial style, well sustained, but having the effect to remove the work out of the domain of prose... it brings about an illusion akin to that worked by ordinary verse form. It is very beautiful in its general movement and color, and very noble in phrase; its affectation, even, sympathizes with the Gothic element in the work itself. It is such prose as only a poet could write\\". The reviewer adds that \\"the work itself is one of extraordinary beauty in detail, and rich both in minute and broad effects\\", illustrating this with \\"Each of his chapters becomes, sooner or later, a picture, admirably grouped, lovely or grand in its unit, but with that care for light and shade and posture, even for costume and framework, which discloses the artist: ... now the scene is under the sunshine of the clearings, often in the shadow of moonlight or the thicket; here a stormy dawn, there a midsummer afternoon; but throughout there is the pencil of the artist.\\" Oscar Wilde begins his 1889 review in the Pall Mall Gazette with the words \\"Mr. Morris's last book is a piece of pure art workmanship from beginning to end, and the very remoteness of its style from the common language and ordinary interests of our day gives to the whole story a strange beauty and an unfamiliar charm. It is written in blended prose and verse, like the mediaeval 'cante-fable'\\". Wilde writes that \\"From an artistic point of view it may be described as an attempt to return by a self-conscious effort to the conditions of an earlier and a fresher age. ... When the result is beautiful the method is justified ... Certainly, Mr. Morris's work possesses this excellence. His fine harmonies and rich cadences create in the reader that spirit by which alone can its own spirit be interpreted, awake in him something of the temper or romance and, by taking him out of his own age, place him in a truer and more vital relation to the great masterpieces of all time\\". After an extensive quotation from the text, Wilde concludes that \\"In days of uncouth realism and unimaginative imitation, it is a high pleasure to welcome work of this kind. It is a work in which all lovers of literature cannot fail to delight.\\" The literary critic Rachel Falconer, looking back at Morris's House of the Wolfings, Lord Dunsany and David Lindsay, comments that whereas contemporary fantasy fiction has been \\"excessive\\" in emulating Tolkien, with his secondary worlds, romance quest, stock characters and story arcs, the earlier and \\"comparatively forgotten\\" authors show \\"how inventive fantasy can be.\\" The scholar of English literature Anna Vaninskaya argues that in House of the Wolfings and Roots of the Mountains, Morris reveals his socialism by portraying \\"ancient war leaders who battle on behalf of their communities rather than for personal glory.\\" Influence The House of the Wolfings was one of the influences on J. R. R. Tolkien's popular The Lord of the Rings. In a December 31, 1960 letter published in The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, (p. 303), Tolkien wrote: 'The Dead Marshes and the approaches to the Morannon owe something to Northern France after the Battle of the Somme. They owe more to William Morris and his Huns and Romans, as in The House of the Wolfings or The Roots of the Mountains.\\"December 31, 1960 letter in The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, p. 303 Among the numerous parallels with The Lord of the Rings, Morris has Old English-style placenames such as Mirkwood,House of the Wolfings, page 2 and the Mark,House of the Wolfings, title page Germanic personal names such as Thiodolf,House of the Wolfings, page 8 and dwarves as skilled smiths (e.g. \\"How the Dwarf-wrought Hauberk was Brought away from the Hall of the Daylings\\").House of the Wolfings, page 97 The novel was reprinted by the Newcastle Publishing Company as the sixteenth volume of the Newcastle Forgotten Fantasy Library in April, 1978.

They were formed in 1979 by founding mainstay Mitch Jones on vocals, guitar and bass guitar and Michael Tee on guitar and synths. Their line up changed often through the 1980s and 1990s. In late 1983 Drusilla Johnson joined on synthesiser and vocals ‚Äì Johnson and Jones later married. The band went on hiatus from 2000‚Äì2011, reforming with a line-up featuring Jones, Tee and Shane Fahey from Makers of the Dead Travel Fast.  History  Scattered Order were formed in 1979 in Sydney by Mitchell Law Ross-Jones Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' &/or 'Performer:' ( Mitch Jones) on vocals, guitar and bass guitar; Michael Tee on guitar and Simon Vidale on drums. Jones worked as a live sound engineer for the Birthday Party and Pel Mel. Jones and Tee formed their own record label, M Squared. They were joined in Scattered Order by Patrick Gibson on guitar and synthesiser in January of the following year. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, their \\"aim was to combine all manner of 'found sounds' and loose song structures with a perverse absurdist sense of humour (in the Snakefinger/Residents vein) and set them to a rock backing; in short, white noise with an amphetamine beat.\\" The group's first recording, \\"Bent Up\\", appeared on a Various Artists album, Growing Pains (November 1980), for their own label. The band issued a four-track extended play, Screaming Tree (May 1981). They followed with another track, \\"I'm not Whole\\", for another Various Artists compilation, A Selection (November). In November 1982 they released their debut album, Prat Culture, which was recorded with the line up of Gibson, Jones and Tee joined by Michael Prowse on drums. McFarlane felt it was \\"abrasive\\"; while Tharunkas reviewer observed, \\"I'm forced to describe it as , which pisses me off because that means it's esoteric, inaccessible and generally annoying... [it] has its high spots; Side one is 45 rpm, side two 33 1/3 and there is even a lyric sheet. Music to do housework to.\\" Gibson and Tee left the group late in 1982. A seven-track EP, I Feel so Relaxed with You (October 1983), was issued by the line up of Jones, Prowse and Shane Fahey on synthesiser and vocals (ex-the Makers of the Dead Travel Fast). It was recorded from March to May at M Squared Studio with Drusilla Johnson supplying cover artwork. McFarlane cited Mark Mordure's description the EP, \\"all open guts and withered emotions\\", who compared it to work by Public Image Ltd. Jon Casimir of The Canberra Times felt the group were, \\"Heavily influenced by European electronic music, particularly the likes of Can, their objective was to explore the possibilities of mixing 'white noise with a beat'.\\" Johnson, who later married Jones, ( Drusilla Dorothy Ross- Jones) Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' &/or 'Performer:' joined the group on synthesiser and vocals along with D. C. \\"Craig\\" Robertson on bass guitar (ex-Pel Mel plus Prowse's band mate from Prod) and R. Scott-Holmes on vocals, guitar, synthesiser and percussion (ex-Same). At the end of 1983 Jones discontinued the label, M Squared, and the group were signed with Volition Records. He later explained, \\"It ended with a lot of debts and we locked the place up and hid from the landlord.\\" They recorded a live seven-track EP, A Dancing Foot and a Praying Knee Don't Belong on the Same Leg (May 1984), at Wakefield Musicians Club in January with Tim Whitten producing. It cost $200, which McFarlane noticed, \\"featured a rhythmic brand of clattering, metallic funk.\\" Fahey left before the album appeared. Scattered Order's next studio album, Career of the Silly Thing, for a cost of $3000, appeared in September 1985, with McFarlane declaring, \\"[it] represented something of a breakthrough release, revealing a shift towards a more conventional and melodic yet still challenging sound.\\" Casimir determined, \\"[it] is their most interesting and accessible, with a more harmonious synthesis of noise and beat than they had previously achieved... [and] reveals an obsession with the grotesque on the part of major songwriters.\\" Jones explained to Casimir, \\"Dru and I got married... This is our honeymoon album. A lot of the lyrics were written on our honeymoon... I'm fascinated with the grotesque. I'd be the first person to be physically ill at it. I'm probably a big wimp.\\" They toured with fellow Sydney-based label mates, Severed Heads, and supported United States group, the Residents, on their Australian tour. Geoff Holmes (ex-Wildcat Tamers) joined on guitar in August 1986, while Scott-Holmes left early in the next year. They released a four-track EP, Selling the Axe to Buy the Wood, in June 1987. McFarlane believed that a track, \\"'Loose in the House', [is] the closest Scattered Order came to scoring a 'hit' single.\\" Prowse had already left the band and in January of the following year they recorded their next album, Comfort (May 1988), using session drummers, Greg Fitzgerald and Robert Souter. One of its two discs contained new work while the other was a compilation of eight tracks of earlier material. \\"King of Blip\\", appeared as their next single in April. With Fitzgerald joining them, they toured the east coast of Australia for four weeks and were supported by Canberra group, Falling Joys. They issued their next album, Professional Dead Ball, in November 1991, then went into hiatus and returned in April 1997 with another album, Chicken Hilton, on the Rather Be Vinyl label. The group went on hiatus again in 2000, reforming in 2011 with original members Jones and Tee and joined by Shane Fahey. They have released six studio albums under the reformed line-up, most recently A Suitcase Full Of Snow Globes in 2017.

He played for the New York Giants (1936‚Äì1939), the Brooklyn Dodgers (1939‚Äì1940), the Cincinnati Reds (1940‚Äì1941), and the Philadelphia Athletics (1943). He had a .282 career batting average, with 28 home runs and 251 RBIs in 554 games played. He played in three World Series, two with the Giants (1936‚Äì1937), and one with the Reds in 1940, which won the championship. In addition to his major league playing time, he had a long 12-season minor league baseball career. He played eight seasons for the Montreal Royals, parts of two for the Rochester Red Wings, and the same for the Toronto Maple Leafs, all of the International League. In 1956, he elected into the International League Hall of Fame. Career=Minor leagues Baseball card of Ripple James Albert Ripple was born on October 14, 1909 in Export, Pennsylvania. He made his first appearance in professional baseball at the age of 19 for the class-C Jeannette Jays of the Middle Atlantic League for the start of the 1929 minor league baseball season. He played in 104 games for the Jays, hitting 24 triples, and 14 home runs, while batting .336, before being promoted to the Montreal Royals of the Class- AA International League for the remainder of the season. For the next six years, through the 1935 season, he remained with the Royals, playing as a starting outfielder. During that span he appeared in at least 130 games each season, hitting for a career highs with 21 home runs in 1932, and a .333 batting average in 1935. Major LeaguesNew York Giants= On June 22, 1935, Ripple was sold by Montreal to the New York Giants of the National League, and made his first appearance for the major league team on April 20, 1936. Platooning with Hank Leiber, Ripple started 74 games in center field for the Giants and appeared in 96 games total in 1936, and had a .305 batting average, seven home runs, and 47 RBIs. The Giants won the National League pennant, and met the New York Yankees of the American League in the 1936 World Series. Although the Yankees won the series four games to two, Ripple played in five of the six games played, starting four in center field and had a batting average of .333. In game three, he hit a home run in the fifth inning off Bump Hadley to score the Giants only run in a 2‚Äì1 defeat. In 1937, Ripple's playing time increased to 121 games, and his 100 starts were split between center and right field, and with the expanded role, he established career highs in all major batting categories except for home runs, which dipped to five. At the conclusion of the 1937 season, he Giants won the National League pennant, and met the New York Yankees again in the World Series. The Yankees defeated the Giants for the second consecutive year, winning four games to one in this series. Ripple played in right field for all five games, collecting five hits in 17 at bats for a .294 batting average. Ripple's playing time in 1938 increased further for the 1938 season, up to 134 games, of which most of them were in right field. Although his role was expanded, his offensive output suffered a significant drop in comparison of his first two seasons with the Giants. His batting average dipped to .261, and he surpassed just one statistical career high with 10 home runs. =Brooklyn Dodgers= Ripple's play suffered more in 1939, and was batting only .228 after playing in just 66 games for the Giants, he was traded to the Brooklyn Dodgers on September 8 for a player to be named later, which was later revealed to be Ray Hayworth. However, this move improved his play, and he had a .330 batting average in 28 games to close out the season. For the 1940 season, the Dodgers assigned Ripple to their class-AA International League team, the Montreal Royals. His return to the Royals resulted in another successful minor league season as he had a .305 batting average in 110 games played. In August, the Dodgers promoted him to the majors for a seven-game stretch, then placed him on waivers. =Cincinnati Reds= The Cincinnati Reds claimed Ripple off waivers from the Dodgers on August 28, 1940, and they made him their regular left fielder for the remainder of the pennant run. In 32 games for the Reds that season, he batted .307, while helping the team win the 1940 National League pennant. Following the regular season, the Reds met the Detroit Tigers in the 1940 World Series, who they defeated in four games to three in a seven-game series. In game two, he hit a 2-run home run off Schoolboy Rowe to give the Reds a 2-run lead in their eventual 5‚Äì3 win to tie the series at one game win each. =Later career= Ripple began the 1941 season with the Reds, playing in 38 games. However, he was hitting just .216, so the Reds sold him to the St. Louis Cardinals on June 21, who then designated him to their International League team, the Rochester Red Wings. He played in 52 games to complete the season, batted .378, hit five home runs, and had 22 RBIs. In 1942, his batting average dropped to .249 through 78 games, and he was transferred to the Toronto Maple Leafs who were unnafiliated with a major league team. He remained with the Maple Leafs into the 1943 season, who were now affiliated with the Pittsburgh Pirates, his contract was later bought by the Philadelphia Athletics of the American League, and they promoted him to their major league club. He appeared in 32 games for the Athletics that season, batted .238, and played his last major league game on September 12, 1943. His major league career hitting totals include a .282 batting average, 28 home runs, 236 RBIs, and 510 hits in 554 games played. Defensively, Ripple recorded a .984 fielding percentage. After committing an error on September 11, 1938 against the Brooklyn Dodgers at the Polo Grounds, he went the next 204 games to the end of his major league career in 1943 without another miscue, handling 241 total chances (238 putouts, 3 assists). His last minor league season occurred in 1944, when he played for several class-AA teams: the Louisville Colonels of the American Association (an affiliate of the Boston Red Sox), the San Francisco Seals and Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League. After 12 minor league seasons, and 1412 games, Ripple totalled 1507 hits, with 128 home runs and a .301 batting average. Post-career For his high level of play during his minor league baseball career, he was named to the International League Hall of Fame in 1956. He died at the age of 49 in Greensburg, Pennsylvania of acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis, and is interred at Eastview Cemetery in Delmont, Pennsylvania.

It is a sequel to the film The Lost World, which was released the same year. Plot Belgian scientist Bertram Hammonds, along with Gomez, who survived being injured in the first film, arrives in the Lost World to drill for crude oil. He and his men begin capturing the natives for slave labor, throwing Chief Palala off the top of the plateau. He survives and is rescued by Malu and taken to a nearby village. Word reaches Edward Malone and Jenny Nielson in England, who remind Professors Challenger and Summerlee of the promise they made to Palala: that they would return to the Lost World should they be needed. However the professors are having a feud. Challenger recently discredited Summerlee on a theory and now they aren't on speaking terms. With help from Jim, Malone and Jenny manage to bamboozle Challenger and Summerlee into coming along with each mistakenly believing they are commanding the expedition while the other is remaining in England. When they encounter one another aboard the steamship bound for Africa, they nearly come to blows. Upon arriving they are led to the base of the plateau by Malu, where she found Chief Palala. Above, attacks by dinosaurs have set back Hammonds' work. His drilling crews accidentally tap into a volcanic pipe during a tyrannosaurus' visit, triggering a volcanic eruption that threatens to destroy the whole plateau. The initial eruption destroys the plane they arrived in. Fleeing, Hammonds and Gomez take Chief Palala's daughter hostage and threaten to kill her unless the natives show them how to leave. Suddenly Challenger and the others arrive, having come the same way they left last time, through the caves. Challenger shoots and kills Gomez, and Hammonds is taken prisoner. After several adventures including clashes with the hostile drilling crew members, the group struggles to stop the erupting volcano. Challenger creates a new explosive, \\"Challengerite,\\" with which to seal the volcano. Boxes of the explosive are put into a cave nearby but Hammonds chases Jim inside, not wanting them to set off the explosives. He tries to ply Jim with promises of wealth but Jim sets off the explosives, stopping the eruption and seemingly killing Hammonds in the process. Afterward, Summerlee congratulates Challenger on the Challengerite, and they muse on how much longer they can keep the Lost World safe from human intervention.

The US release features exclusive tracks, such as \\"The Art of Suicide - Acoustic\\" and out-takes from the Opheliac recording sessions. A third issuing of Opheliac, entitled The Deluxe Edition, was released by The End Records in October 2009 to coincide with her first American tour. Track listingSongs and lyrics Autumn performing a song from \\"Opheliac\\" in Germany, 2007. The album was written solely by Autumn. The name Opheliac derives from the song of the same name, which also served as the album's lead single. The song's name is derived from the character Ophelia from Shakespeare's play Hamlet, whom the song is about. Emilie has described the word \\"Opheliac\\" as meaning \\"to explain the condition of a person have the characteristics of 'Ophelia' and the 'Ophelia' archetype. While the original Ophelia did indeed go 'mad', it was not primarily caused by her boyfriend knocking off her dad, but rather by not only Hamlet, but also all the men in her life manipulating and pushing her to the point of no alternative.\\" The song \\"Shalott\\" is based on the poem \\"The Lady of Shalott\\" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. She also talks about her bipolar disorder in songs such as \\"God Help Me\\", \\"Swallow\\", and \\"Misery Loves Company\\". The songs \\"I Want My Innocence Back\\" and \\"Gothic Lolita\\" were inspired by the abuse Autumn went through as a child. Lolita also being the title and nickname of a young girl who is forced into a relationship with an older man in Vladimir Nabokov's novel Lolita. The Opheliac Companion In August 2009, Emilie released a companion \\"album\\" to Opheliac. This \\"album\\" consisted of an interview/chat between Emilie and her \\"sound guy\\" Inkydust. The discussion covers everything from the musical backing tracks to metaphors used in the lyrics. Containing 15 tracks at a length of approximately 8 hours, the album is currently available from Emilie's official store, AmazonMP3, Spotify, and iTunes.

The wooden-hulled purse seiner S. G. Giuseppe, built in 1937 at Wilmington, California, by the boatbuilders Trigoning and Carlson, was acquired by the Navy from M. B. Giuseppe, of San Pedro, California, on 5 November 1940, and delivery and acceptance by the Commandant, 11th Naval District, took place the same day. Conversion to a coastal minesweeper began immediately, at the Campbell Machine Co., of San Diego, California; renamed Firecrest and designated as a coastal minesweeper (AMc-33), the ship was placed in service on 4 April 1941, Ensign Charles S. Judson, Jr., USNR, officer-in-charge.  World War II service  By the end of April 1941, Firecrest was operating out of the Section Base, San Diego, north of the destroyer base at that port. In concert with , she began daily operations in San Diego harbor, streaming her sweep gear; she also conducted independent sweeping operations during that time. As the spring of 1941 gave way to the summer, Firecrest alternately swept the harbor waters with her magnetic or acoustical gear, patrolled, or conducted training. On 17 July 1941, during a towing operation in a heavy ground swell, she lost one of her 400-pound anchors.  Attack on Pearl Harbor  After a brief period out of commission pending the arrival of new parts for her 540 kilowatt generator engine (3‚Äì4 December 1941), she resumed active operations on 5 December 1941, underway on assigned duty planting drill mines. Two days later, however, the Japanese surprise attack against the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor resulted in emergency duty for Firecrest at the harbor entrance, with four new men being assigned to her complement.  Assigned minesweeping and patrol duties  With her home yard at Mare Island, Vallejo, California, and her home port, San Diego, Firecrest was transferred from duty under Commander, Western Sea Frontier to Commander, Naval Local Defense Forces, 11th Naval District, on 16 March 1943. She conducted coastal patrol and minesweeping operations into the following summer.  Services no longer required  Firecrest's services \\"no longer required in minesweeping duties,\\" Commandant, 11th Naval District, was requested (20 July 1944) to remove all type and military equipment and place her out of service with an eye toward future disposition. Accordingly placed out of service on 18 September 1944, Firecrest was stricken from the Navy Register on 14 October 1944 and delivered to the War Shipping Administration on 3 April 1945.  Post-war return to fishing  Reverting to her original name, S. G. Giuseppe, soon thereafter, and under the ownership of Antonio D'Ambra of Los Angeles, California, she operated in the fishing trade into the early 1950s.

He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . The native of St. Louis, Missouri, was the eldest of three brothers who made baseball their profession; the others were Wally Roettger, an outfielder who played in 599 games over eight seasons (1927‚Äì1934) with four National League teams, and, later, a college baseball head coach; and Harold, a front-office executive who worked for Branch Rickey with both the Brooklyn Dodgers and Pittsburgh Pirates. Oscar's playing career lasted from 1921‚Äì1939. He broke into the Majors with the Yankees of Babe Ruth as a pitcher, but he struggled on the mound in a six-game trial spread out over two seasons. Sent back to the minors, he returned to the big leagues with Brooklyn as a position player in 1927, starting one game as a right fielder and making four appearances as a pinch hitter. Then, five years later, he got into 26 games for the 1932 Athletics, starting 13 games at first base in April and May when Philadelphia's regular at the position, Baseball Hall of Fame slugger Jimmie Foxx, temporarily moved to third base. Roettger collected 14 hits, only one‚Äîa double‚Äîfor extra bases, and batted a meek .233. They were the only hits of his MLB tenure; he batted .212 overall in 66 at bats and 74 plate appearances, with six runs batted in. As a pitcher, he had no decisions in six games, although he is credited with one save, which was not an official statistic at the time. He allowed 17 hits, 14 bases on balls, and 11 earned runs in only 11 innings, with seven strikeouts. However, Roettger would enjoy extended success in the minors as a hard-hitting first baseman and fixture for the St. Paul Saints and Montreal Royals of the 1920s and 1930s. After the 1941 baseball season, Roettger‚Äîthen in his early forties‚Äîenlisted in the United States Army for World War II military service.Baseball in Wartime.com When the war ended, he joined Rawlings full-time, working into the 1980s as the company's chief sales executive for Major and minor league teams. In 1983, in Nashville, Tennessee, he was presented with the King of Baseball Award given by Minor League Baseball at the annual winter meetings. He died at age 86 in St. Louis.

Warren, MD, FRCP(C) & Ingrid Catz, Senior Scientist) at the University of Alberta for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Dirucotide is a synthetic peptide that consists of 17 amino acids linked in a sequence identical to that of a portion of human myelin basic protein (MBP). The sequence of these 17 amino acids is *H2N-Asp-Glu-Asn-Pro-Val-Val-His-Phe-Phe- Lys-Asn-Ile-Val-Thr-Pro-Arg-Thr-OH Research Results from a phase II and long-term follow-up trial showed that dirucotide safely delayed median time to disease progression for five years in progressive MS patients with HLA-DR2 or HLA-DR4 immune response genes. It does not seem to be effective in patients with other gene variants. The drug is exclusively licensed by BioMS Medical Corp., a Canadian-based biotechnology company. BioMS Medical received clearance from the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to initiate a phase III clinical trial, named MAESTRO-03, for secondary progressive MS patients in January 2007. An additional Phase III clinical trial for dirucotide, MAESTRO-01, is being undertaken in Canada and Europe. In September 2008, the drug was granted FDA fast-track for approval. A phase II trial of Dirucotide as a potential therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), MINDSET-01, failed to achieve its primary endpoint of reduced relapse rate. Nor did it reduce new MRI lesions. It did however reduce progression on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) scale. Phase III trials are now in progress with reduction of EDSS and MSFC progression as primary endpoints. BioMS Medical has agreed to share development of dirucotide with Eli Lilly and Company, which received exclusive worldwide rights to future research and development, manufacturing, and marketing of the compound. Mechanism of action T cells producing receptors recognizing MBP fragments presented by the MHC molecules of antigen presenting cells seem to play a role in the pathogenesis of MS. Repeated application of dirucotide (intravenous, every six months) represses immunological response against MBP. Status of the development On 27 July 2009, a statement was released, stating \\"BioMS Medical Corp.

A typical event related to the faith is called , held on the K≈çshin days that occur every 60 days in accordance with the Chinese sexagenary cycle. On this day some believers stay awake to prevent , entities believed to live inside the body of believers, from leaving it during that night in order to report the good and specially the bad deeds of the believer to the god Ten-Tei. It is not clearly certain when such custom arrived or came into fashion in Japan, although it is believed that by some time in the 9th century it had been already practiced at least by aristocrats. A Japanese monk called Ennin wrote in his travel book upon visiting Tang China in 838, that \\"Tonight people are not sleeping. It is the same as in our country on K≈çshin nights.\\" In the Muromachi period, Buddhist monks started to write about the K≈çshin, which led to wider popularity of the faith among public. Numerous monuments or pillars called (or also ) were erected all over the country and the faith remained very popular through the Edo period. When the Meiji Government issued the Shinto and Buddhism Separation Order in 1872, folk beliefs were turned down as superstitious, K≈çshin belief too losing popularity as a result. Today, the K≈çshin belief still survives, although it is far less popular and receives smaller recognition than it once did, due to the absence of any central organization to help promote such faith because of its folkloric nature. While many K≈çshin-t≈ç were moved, for example, to inside Buddhist temples or even to private houses to be protected, there are many remaining along historical roads as well. There are also well maintained , built in respect for the K≈çshin, sometimes attached to Buddhist temples, or otherwise in stand-alone. Deities and customs It is believed that K≈çshin belief had arrived in Japan at the latest by the Heian period, and was adopted only by the aristocracy in the beginning. The most ancient custom is that of staying awake one special night every sixty days. It is called K≈çshin-Machi (Â∫öÁî≥ÂæÖ - K≈çshin Waiting). During the early years this custom became a kind of overnight festivity or party. The main K≈çshin belief that survived from an original complex faith, is the concept that Three Corpses, called Sanshi (‰∏âÂ∞∏), live in everyone's body. The Sanshi keep track of the good deeds and particularly the bad deeds of the person they inhabit. On the night called K≈çshin-Machi (which happens each 60 days), while the person sleeps, the Sanshis leave the body and go to Ten-Tei (Â§©Â∏ù), the Heavenly god, to report about the deeds of that person. Ten-Tei will then decide to punish bad people, making them ill, shortening their lifetime and in extreme cases putting an end to their lives. Believers of K≈çshin will try to live a life without bad deeds, but those who have reason to fear will try to stay awake during K≈çshin nights, as the only way to prevent the Sanshi from leaving the body and reporting to Ten-Tei. In the Edo period, K≈çshin-Machi became more popular in other levels of society and with commoners, leading to a proliferation of festivities and cultic activities. Many of these practices convened around the worship of specific deities. These deities were visualized in hanging scrolls, icons, and stone carvings, many of which continue to dot the rural landscape of Japan today. One god of special prominence in the K≈çshin cult was Sh≈çmen-Kong≈ç (Blue-Faced Vajra-Yak·π£a), a fearsome blue-faced deity with many arms. Sh≈çmen- Kong≈ç's role connections with K≈çshin belief and practice can be traced back as early as the late Heian period, if not earlier. The first scriptures that established such connections were significantly produced in the context of esoteric Buddhist rituals centered at Onj≈çji (a.k.a. Miidera). Another temple crucial in the early development of this cult was Shitenn≈ç-ji. Sh≈çmen-Kong≈ç became K≈çshin-san when people expected this deity to make the Sanshis themselves ill and prevent them going to Ten-Tei. Three monkeys covering eyes, mouth and ears with their hands are the best known symbols of K≈çshin faith. They are Mizaru (not see), Iwazaru (not say) and Kikazaru (not hear). It is not very clear why the three monkeys became part of K≈çshin belief, but is assumed that it is because like the monkeys, the Sanshis and Ten-Tei are not to see, hear, or tell the bad deeds of a person. Statues of Sh≈çmen-Kong≈ç with the three monkeys have existed in temples and shrines since the Edo era. Sometimes carved stones called K≈çshin-t≈ç were placed around a dwelling for protection. Such stones can present diverse forms, from having only Chinese characters (kanji) to including a depiction of Sh≈çmen- Kong≈ç with one, two or three monkeys. Other custom of the K≈çshin belief are the use of paper scrolls also showing K≈çshin-san and the monkeys which are displayed on K≈çshin-machi, the K≈çshin night. Those who keep this tradition invite neighbours, friends and relatives and sit in front of a provisory altar which has a bowl of rice, soup, seasonal fruit, flowers, candles and incense sticks. They also hang scrolls with pictures of Sh≈çmen-Kong≈ç. Everyone will try to stay awake through the whole night.

He was the first U.S. Army general officer to be killed in World War II, and the second flag officer, after Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd. Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma is named in his honor. Early life Clarence Tinker was born on November 21, 1887 near Pawhuska, Oklahoma in the Osage Nation, the eldest son of George Edward Tinker and Sarah A. (Schwagerte) Tinker. He was raised as an Osage and learned the language and culture from his parents and extended family. His maternal grandmother was half-Osage; both her parents were mixed-race Osage. They had Osage mothers, and fathers who were French traders from Canada. Tinker received his elementary education in Catholic schools at Hominy and Pawhuska, Oklahoma, and at the Elgin, Kansas public school. Tinker and his friends learned about and idolized the 19th- century Osage Indian scouts who served with the U.S. cavalry, and Bonnycastle, the Osage chief who, according to Dr. James Crowder in his book, Osage General: Maj. Gen. Clarence L. Tinker.\\", helped to suppress the \\"Boxer\\" rebellion in China. While growing up, Clarence worked in the print shop of his father's newspaper, the Wah-Sha-She News. It was founded by his father and was one of Pawhuska's first weekly newspapers. Beginning in 1900, Tinker attended the Haskell Institute, the famous Indian school in Lawrence, Kansas, but withdrew before graduating. In the fall of 1906, Tinker enrolled at Wentworth Military Academy in Lexington, Missouri.

After infantry training, Tinker joined the Twenty-fifth Infantry Regiment at Fort George Wright in Spokane, Washington. In 1913, his unit was transferred to Schofield Barracks in Hawaii. There he met and married Madeline Doyle, a native of Halifax, Nova Scotia. During World War I, Tinker served in the southwestern United States and California, and was promoted to major. In 1919, Tinker began flying lessons. One of his assignments after the war was with the ROTC at Riverside High School in California. When his father came to visit him at the school, they began a conversation in Osage in public. Using his native language was one way that Tinker expressed his identity as Osage. In 1922, he transferred to the Army Air Service. On July 1, 1922, he was assigned to flight duty. For a time, Tinker served as the air attache to the US embassy in London. He studied at the Army Command and Staff College in the same class as Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1927, he was named Commandant of the Air Service Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field, Texas. Tinker commanded various pursuit and bomber units during the 1930s. He was steadily promoted, and on October 1, 1940, became a brigadier general. Clarence L. Tinker c. 1920 After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Tinker was named Commander of the Seventh Air Force in Hawaii to reorganize the air defenses of the islands. He believed that the Air Force was going to be critical to the entire war, and that Japan would eventually be defeated through a long-strike effort by air. In January 1942, he was promoted to major general, the first Native American in U.S. Army history to attain that rank. In June 1942, the Japanese began their assault of Midway Island. In the midst of the Battle of Midway, on June 7, General Tinker decided to lead a force of early model B-24s of the 31st Bombardment SquadronPacific Wrecks report against the retreating Japanese naval forces. Near Midway Island, his plane was seen to go out of control and plunge into the sea. General Tinker and ten other crewmen perished. The plane and bodies were never recovered.

Its areas of education and research include toxic chemicals, urban sprawl, oil sands, global warming, water quality, and endangered species. History The organization was founded in 1984. Environmental Defence was part of the founding of the Green Energy Act Alliance. The Green Energy and Economy Act, a first for North America, went into law in Ontario in 2009, and outlined a strategy to improve conservation, increase renewable energy generation, and create green jobs. The Act formed part of the Ontario government's plan to put the province on a path towards reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, while becoming a leader in the emerging global renewable energy sector. In its 2018 annual report, Environmental Defence stated that, during the year prior, it had raised over C$3.8 million. Areas of focus Environmental Defence has a number of different areas of focus, including the following: * Combating climate change, and creating jobs in the clean economy. * Growing Ontario's Greenbelt, and developing functional, livable cities. * Ensuring safe products are on Canadians' shelves. *Informing the public about the dangerous chemicals in consumer products. * Protecting safe, clean water. * Creating a future free from plastic waste. * Engaging young people in the future of environmental journalism. Studies In 2008, Environmental Defence and The Workgroup for Safe Markets in the US commissioned a report, researched by a lab at the University of Missouri, which stated that plastic baby bottles from a number of manufacturers, including Avent, Evenflo, Dr. Brown's and Disney/First Years, were leaching unsafe levels of bisphenol A (BPA) when heated. This led to dozens of state and national environmental health organizations in Canada and the United States calling for an immediate moratorium on the use of BPA in baby bottles, and other food and beverage containers. In 2017, Environmental Defence and The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) released a report showing how tar sands mining operations in Alberta generated over 250 billion gallons of toxic tailings ‚Äì a poisonous mixture of water, sand, silt, heavy metals, and other petrochemical waste products ‚Äì have been stored in toxic lakes that cover an area greater than Manhattan and Boston combined.

It was published in Great Britain by Hodder Children's Books in 2000 and by Delacorte Press in the United States in 2001. A paperback version was released in 2002 by Dell Laurel Leaf. Heaven's Eyes was adapted as a stage production, which premiered in Edinburgh in 2005. Apparently published early 2007. \\"Heaven Eyes, presented by award-winning children's author David Almond and acclaimed theatre company Pop-Up ...\\" Plot summary The story focuses on three children who run away from their orphanage and are rescued by Heaven Eyes, a strange, innocent child with webbed hands and feet. The sole survivor of a shipwreck, Heaven Eyes was rescued by the elderly caretaker of a gigantic old printing press and storage building. He raises her lovingly and she calls him her Grampa. He knows the secret to her history. He isn't telling. The orphans find themselves investigating the mysteries surrounding Heaven Eyes and her environment. During the time they spend with Heaven Eyes and Grampa, they begin to see the outside world as a land of \\"ghosts\\", as Grampa does. The children have to choose to stay in that eccentric, mysterious and possibly sinister world or to flee back to the mundane world and perhaps lose the hopes of spiritual healing they discovered in Heaven Eyes' world. But the outer world has changed too, in the short space of time they have been gone. Even in the old orphanage, new possibilities might emerge. Major themes Like most of Almond's other young adult books, Heaven Eyes focuses on the balance between fantasy and reality, all within a quaint and eccentric but mysterious and somewhat unsettling world. Other major themes include spiritual healing and family (particularly mothers, as many of the main characters long for a mother they have never known or have known but tragically lost). Writing When Almond began writing the novel, he felt that Erin should be the main character because she was the strongest and because he wanted to write from the point of view of a girl this time. Almond referred to the novel's opening line, \\"My name is Erin Law\\", as a \\"bit of an homage\\" to the opening line of Moby Dick, \\"Call me Ishmael.\\" The abandoned building in the novel was inspired by a real building located on a \\"sludgy river gully\\" near the Tyne, which has been turned into Seven Stories, an attraction that promotes literature. Characters=Major characters * Erin Law is the novel's main protagonist. She is an earnest, emotional, rebellious, adventurous child. She deeply feels the loss of her mother. Erin's mother lived with her in a house with a beautiful garden, and Erin often \\"speaks\\" with the memory of her mother and visualizes that place. The novel takes her on a spiritual quest for family. * January Carr is another child living at Whitegates. He is very much like Erin, although somewhat more distrustful. He secretly believes that his mother is a beautiful, very young woman who will return for him when she is older and more able to care for him). * Mouse Gullane is a younger child who enjoys digging in the dirt and finding small plastic toys and other artifacts. He hopes to one day uncover something much more important buried in the earth. He has a pet mouse named Squeak. He is an abandoned child. * Heaven Eyes is the strange pale child with a mysterious past who rescues Erin and her friends. She appears to be friendly but has very odd customs. * Grampa is the eccentric, seemingly deranged man who takes care of Heaven Eyes. He has dark hair and a beard and wears a jacket that says \\"Security\\" on it. Grampa is constantly writing in a book in which he records every thing he sees in and around the Middens, from the wildlife to the number of pop bottles. He considers all outsiders to be \\"ghosts\\". * Maureen is the woman who runs Whitegates. She tries hard to care for the children, but can't help seeing them as \\"damaged\\". She also can't hide her disappointment at not having children of her own, and tells Erin that she is the daughter she dreams of. Minor characters * Wilson Cairns is an obese, bespectacled boy who was taken away from his violent, abusive parents. He is calm, kind and introverted.

The O'Toole () family of Leinster, formerly one of the leading Royal families of that province, are descended from Tuathal Mac Augaire, King of Leinster (died 958), who belonged to the U√≠ D√∫nlainge dynasty. History The first to use the surname in true hereditary fashion appears to have the grandson of Tuathal Mac Augaire, Doncaon, slain at Leighlin in 1014. Their original territory comprised the southern part of the present County Kildare but they were driven from it during the Anglo Norman invasion and settled in the mountains of what is now County Wicklow around Glendalough through the 12th century. The area they controlled was roughly identical to the old diocese of Glendalough, with the centre of their power in the region around the Glen of Imaal. Despite the proximity of Dublin, the centre of English rule in Ireland, the √ì Tuathail's maintained a fierce independence, and were a source of great fear to the inhabitants of Dublin and the Pale for almost four centuries. With their kinsmen the O'Byrne family, they were noted for their tough resistance to English domination, including exercising great influence over the foundation of the Confederation of Kilkenny in 1642 in what had become Confederate Ireland. At the start of the 16th century, there were five great houses, all, owing allegiance to \\"The O'Toole of Powerscourt\\" as the recognized chief: *O'Toole of Castleruddery, residing in Glen Imaile.http://www.megalithicireland.com/Castleruddery.htm *O'Toole of O'Toole's Castle, Ballymacledy, (now Upper Talbotstown), Glen Imaile. *O'Toole of Carnew Castle. *Art Oge O'Toole of Castle Kevin, Fertie. *Tirlogh O'Toole of Powerscourt, Feracualan. *O'Toole of Omey, Iar Connaught, with other minor houses of the family such as OToole of Ballineddan and Brittas, in the Glen Imaile; O'Toole of Toolestown, near Dunlavin; O'Toole of Glengap, or Glen of the Downs (as it is now called); and a few others. At the start of the 16th century, the leading branches of the clan were to a certain extent independent of each other; they were all bound to protect themselves; but in external matters affecting the whole clan they were bound to obey the head of the sept.. Throughout their history the family were famous as soldiers, from fighting the English in the glens of Wicklow to serving in the armies of other Catholic European countries in the 18th century, such as France and Spain. A branch of the O'Tooles are also settled in counties Galway, Mayo and Cavan Name variants The descendants of the sept took the name O'Toole, although the name is now rare without the prefix 'O'. The tradition of surnames in Ireland developed spontaneously, as the population increased and the former practice, first of single names and then of ephemeral patronymics or agnomina of the nickname type proved insufficiently definitive. At first the surname was formed by prefixing 'Mac' to the father's Christian name or '√ì 'to that of a grandfather or earlier ancestor.

His research focuses on developing urban interventions that enable more entrepreneurial, livable, high- performance urban districts. Projects include advanced simulation and augmented reality for urban design, transformable micro-housing for millennials, mobility-on-demand systems that create alternatives to private automobiles, and urban living lab deployments in Hamburg, Helsinki, Andorra, Taipei, Shanghai, Toronto, and Guadalajara. He and the researchers from his MIT lab have twice received the ‚Äú10-Year Impact Award‚Äù from Ubicomp: a ‚Äútest of time‚Äù award for work that, with the benefit of that hindsight, has had the greatest impact. His book, Louis I. Kahn: Unbuilt Masterworks was selected as one of the Ten Best Books in Architecture by the New York Times Review of Books.Reviews of the Ten Best Books in Architecture, 2000 by the New York Times Review of Books Larson's TED talk, \\"Brilliant designs to fit more people in every city,\\" summarized his vision for cities in the future. Research at MIT Larson's MIT research has focused on four areas: Responsive Housing: The Changing Places project is focused on developing strategies to create high- performance, technology-enabled personalized, places of living that respond to a shortage of affordable urban housing and new ways of living and working. In this approach, buildings are disentangled into three independently configured layers: high performance chassis (building structure and utilities), integrated infill that makes use of agile technology and architectural robotics, and responsive fa√ßade modules. These concepts are being deployed in the CityHome: a compact, transformable apartment system for urban dwellers that functions as if a much larger space. Larson is a founder of ORI Living, an MIT spinoff company to commercialize architectural robotics. Urban Modeling and Prediction: The CityScope project combines physical 3D models, augmented reality, and real-time prediction to support experts and non-experts in a new decision-making process to make better cities. CityScope platforms have been deployed in Cambridge, Boston, Hamburg, Andorra, Helsinki, Shanghai, and other cities around the world. The FindingPlaces project made use of a CityScope to bring together the residents of Hamburg, Germany to identify optimal locations to provide housing for a growing number of refugees from the war in Syria. It combined optically tagged color-coded LEGO bricks, touch feed-back and geographical simulation algorithms to create a hands-on experience that allowed users to understand current land features and collectively propose housing sites by placing tangible LEGO bricks at different sites on the physical model. Through this immersive process, project partners from MIT City Science, the Hamburg Mayor‚Äôs Office, and HafenCity University Hamburg (HCU) brought the residents‚Äô personal experiences and local knowledge into the government‚Äôs decision-making process. Urban Mobility-on-Demand: Upon the 2010 death of William J. Mitchell, former Dean of the MIT School of Architecture and Planning, Larson's group continued work on the MIT CityCar and developed concepts for shared-use light electric vehicles and intelligent fleet management to provide high-levels of service through sensor networks, dynamic incentives, and intelligent charging. Kent Larson's City Science research group is currently developing a shared-use, ultra-lightweight, autonomous, three-wheel electric vehicle, called the Persuasive Electric Vehicle or PEV, to move both people and goods along bike lanes in central cities. Living Labs: Larson, along with colleagues William J. Mitchell, and Alex (Sandy) Pentland at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are credited with first exploring the concept of a Living Laboratory. They argued that a living lab represents a user-centric research methodology for sensing, prototyping, validating and refining complex solutions in multiple and evolving real life contexts.

(born 21 September 1940) was, until September 2011, a distinguished research professor in English literature at Cardiff University; and is a professorial fellow of Literature at the University of Melbourne. His areas of expertise include medieval English and European literature, Robin Hood, Merlin, cultural studies, crime fiction, and Australian matters. He has authored over thirty books, and is well known in the public sphere for his contribution to a range of fields. His most recent books have been The Politics of Myth (2015), Towards Sherlock Holmes: A Thematic History of Crime Fiction in the 19th Century World (2017), Australian Crime Fiction: A 200-year History (2018), The Fiction of G.W.M. Reynolds: The Man Who Outsold Dickens (2019) and The University is Closed for Open Day: Themes and Scenes from 21st Century Australia (2019).  Biography  Knight was educated at Bournemouth Grammar School and at Jesus College, Oxford. He graduated in 1962 and was appointed to the University of Sydney in 1963. In 1968‚Äì69 he was lecturer in English at the Australian National University, and he returned to the University of Sydney in 1970, where he was senior lecturer and associate professor. In 1986 he was appointed Robert Wallace Professor of English at the University of Melbourne. and in 1992 returned to Britain to the first chair of English at the new De Montfort University in Leicester. In 1994, he moved to a position at Cardiff University as professor and head of English; he was also head of the School of English, Philosophy and Communication, and from 2006 was appointed distinguished research professor. Knight is a Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities, a Fellow of the English Association, and a Cyfaill y Celtiaid, or \\"Fellow of the Celts\\". Much of Knight's scholarly writings have been in the areas of medieval English literature, Robin Hood, Merlin and the Arthurian myth . His long-standing interest in crime fiction generated the study Form and Ideology in Crime Fiction (1980), and several other books and essay-collections, including Continent of Mystery: A Thematic History of Australian Crime Fiction (1997), for which he was awarded the Ned Kelly Lifetime Achievement Award. He has also written sociocultural commentaries, notably The Selling of the Australian Mind (1990), Freedom Was Compulsory (1994), and a new set of socio-critical Australian essays The University is Closed for Open Day (2019).  Major works = Robin Hood: A Mythic Biography  This book, which won the 2005 International Mythopoeic Society Award for Non-Fiction, traces the origins of the myth, providing insights into why Robin Hood is still such an essential and evolving figure in culture and literature. Knight presents the detailed elements and contexts of the Robin Hood myth, as he explores its changing representations and conceptions. The Robin Hood myth has a life of its own, Knight says \\"To study Robin Hood,\\" as Knight explains, \\"is to study over five hundred years of the development of modern concepts of heroism, art, politics, and the self. It is an exciting and enthralling domain of study, that can in itself become a guide to the changing patterns and dynamics of society and culture over an enormous period.\\"  A Hundred Years of Fiction: Writing Wales in English  After becoming Professor and Head of English at Cardiff University, Wales, Knight introduced the department's first courses in Welsh fiction in English and then produced in 2004 the first book written on this topic, which began a series on the topic from the University of Wales Press. Exploring the fiction and the context of his own South Welsh family, its first section explored the slow growth of English-language Welsh fiction in the nineteenth century, then devoted a full section to the major development of novels and stories about \`The Industrial Settlement‚Äô, well into the twentieth century. The third section deals with \`Integration and Independence‚Äô, charting how since the mid- twentieth century writers in English have grown increasingly familiar with, even close to, the Welsh-language culture of the country, and how in the later twentieth century, as Wales became increasing independent, its writers, notably Emyr Humphreys and Chris Meredith, both Welsh speakers, wrote in English fiction inherently for the country as a whole  Merlin: Knowledge and Power Through the Ages  This book traces the myth of Merlin back to its earliest roots in the early Welsh figure of Myrddin and he then follows Merlin as he is re-imagined through centuries of literature and art, beginning with Geoffrey of Monmouth, whose immensely popular Latin History of the Kings of Britain (c. 1136) transmitted the story of Merlin to Europe at large. The book covers French and German as well as Anglophone elements of the myth and brings the story up to the present with discussions of a globalised Merlin who finds his way into popular literature, film, television, and New Age philosophy. In tracing the applied meanings of knowledge in a range of social contexts, Knight reveals the four main stages of the Merlin myth: Wisdom (early Celtic British), Advice (medieval European), Cleverness (early modern English), and Education (worldwide since the nineteenth century). The book argues that Merlin in all his guises represents a conflict basic to Western societies-the clash between knowledge and power. While the Merlin story varies over time, the underlying structural tension remains the same whether it takes the form of bard versus lord, vizier versus monarch, scientist versus capitalist, or academic versus politician: Merlin embodies the contentious duality inherent to organized societies.  The Mysteries of the Cities: Urban Crime Fiction in the Nineteenth Century  This study describes the lengthy popular fictions that responded to the new, exciting and alarming experience of city life in the mid nineteenth century. Starting with Eug√®ne Sue‚Äôs Les Myst√®res de Paris (1842-3) it shows how young authors, working for newspapers and street level publishers, did not use the new power of detectives or the old patterns of aristocratic and moral control, and simply realised the multiple, overlapping, chaotic and often violent stories of modern urban crime. The mode was picked up by George W. M. Reynolds in The Mysteries of London (1844-8), and was also imitated in multiple American versions, of which the most impressive are George Lippard‚Äôs The Quaker City, or The Monks of Monk Hall (1845), about Philadelphia, and The Mysteries of New York (1848) by E. C. Z. Judson (better known as \`Ned Buntline‚Äô).. The Mysteries genre spread around the world ‚Äì including to Berlin, St Petersburg, Milan, and many American urban centres: the last true realisation was in gold-rich Melbourne in 1873, when Donald Cameron produced The Mysteries of Melbourne Life. Knight shows how this material expresses and examines the drama of new megalopolitan life, how it influenced authors who sometimes claimed not to admire it such as Victor Hugo, Charles Dickens and √âmile Zola, and how this genre is a massively overlooked storehouse of story, melodrama and above all urban emotional history.  The Politics of Myth: Social Meanings from King Arthur to Ned Kelly  This book challenges the idea that myths are just quaint fables from the past that function to entertain and distract people from modern anxieties. It argues major myths represent a set of forces and challenges that remain relevant across time and are reworked and reinterpreted to focus concerns in changing periods and new social contexts. Studying major myths that have remained alive in world culture (all the figures discussed have been in film and television in the 21st century) it shows three major areas of debate through myth, namely Power, Resistance and Knowledge. The mythical figures in these domains cross social boundaries ‚Äì kings and queens like Arthur, Guinevere and Elizabeth I are analysed, and so are mythic celebrities of humble origin like Jeanne d‚ÄôArc, Ned Kelly and Robin Hood. As those names indicate, reality and myth interweave. The actuality of another figure discussed here, Shakespeare, has been often challenged, and people still write letters to the genuinely mythic Sherlock Holmes. While some insist Robin Hood must have existed, the only good candidate for ancient reality is that most mysterious man of knowledge, Merlin. Myths are indeed mythic.  Towards Sherlock Holmes: A Thematic History of Crime Fiction in the 19th Century World.  This study goes into much more detail on nineteenth-century crime fiction than Knight's earlier work on this material, which was more summary-oriented than theme-focused. The purpose here is to use close research to explore the issues and socio-cultural domains that are dealt with in the crime fiction that led to ‚Äì and continued through -- the dominating myth of Sherlock Holmes. The first two chapters go outside England to explore the traditions of American crime fiction in the century and then, under the title \`Sherlock Holmes‚Äô Grandmother‚Äô (who was from France), the richly suggestive French contributions to the genre. These are followed by socially-focused chapters, the first dealing with class in English crime fiction of the nineteenth century, and the next on the role of women detectives in that period. This is followed by a study of crime fiction elements in the work of major novelists, Gaskell, Collins, Dickens, Braddon and Wood. The next chapter studies in detail the often referenced but never properly analysed first true best-seller of the genre, Fergus Hume's Melbourne-based The Mystery of a Hansom Cab; the last chapter deals in a thematic way with the element of imperialism, and also anti-imperialism, in the fiction of Conan Doyle ‚Äì not only his Sherlock Holmes stories. Australian Crime Fiction: A 200-Year History In 1997 Knight published Continent of Mystery: A Thematic History of Australian Crime Fiction, a study of the genre up to 1995 which focused on separate themes, with chapters on Origins, Women, Police, Place, and Colonial/Post-Colonial. The new book differs by being a formal history of the genre, with much wider reference to authors and their contexts; it also discusses the many authors who have emerged since 1995 in the new flourishing of the genre in Australia. Section 1 deals with the first century, 1818‚Äì1914, and Section 2 with the period 1915‚Äì45, after the dominance of English publishers was somewhat disrupted during war time. Section 3, covering 1946‚Äì1979, shows the notable development of women authors and the psychothriller, while Section 4 accounts for the important period 1980-99 when, with English publishers largely withdrawing from the field, a vigorous new range of Australian authors developed the private-eye model (both male and female), and the nationally popular and essentially pro-criminal crime novel, as well as the psychothriller, coming largely from women authors. Section 5, dealing only with 2000 to 2017, nevertheless describes the largest number of authors and novels of any section, and shows how police detectives, for long nationally unpopular, finally become, in both genders, a major element in what is now a widely recognised, socially explorative and strong-selling genre.  G.W.M. Reynolds and His Fiction: The Man Who Outsold Dickens  Having published in The Mysteries of the Cities (2012) a chapter on George Reynolds‚Äô The Mysteries of London (1844-48), Knight grew increasingly interested in this hugely popular author of thirty-six novels, several of them multi-volume, and over twenty million words of fiction in all. Reynolds has been almost completely ignored by English literary criticism, in part because of his popular status, but also because of his politics: he was a Chartist and general supporter of the lower social orders, especially seeking their improved education. Much disliked by Dickens, largely for his radicalism, he in return called Dickens an \`aristocratic lickspittle‚Äô. Literary criticism has evidently shared hostility to his politics and popular orientation and he has hardly ever been discussed or even mentioned in critical surveys. There have in recent years been some essays written on him, but this book, surveying and analysing all of Reynolds novels and novellas, is the first written on this remarkably overlooked and decidedly important author.  Media  Knight has appeared in the media many times, producing reviews for newspapers, magazines and radio, including for ten years from the mid-1970s a monthly column in The Sydney Morning Herald on crime fiction. He has also written radio reviews and features and has appeared on Melvyn Bragg's BBC Radio 4 programme In Our Time, discussing Robin Hood, Merlin, and the legend of the Fisher King, as well as on the 2006 BBC television production World of Robin Hood, with Jonathan Ross. He has done a range of interviews on The Politics of Myth (2015). He received media attention across the world in 1999 through his commentary in London's The Sunday Times relating to gender roles in the Robin Hood legend, which some elements of the media took to be evidence that Robin Hood was gay.

Later writers wrote that Persaeus had been Zeno's slave,cf. e.g. Aulus Gellius, Attic Nights, ii. 18. 8 who had perhaps originally been an amanuensis sent to Zeno by King Antigonus II Gonatas; however, the source of this story seems to be due to a sarcastic remark made about Persaeus by Bion of Borysthenes who upon seeing a statue of Persaeus inscribed: \\"Persaeus the pupil of Zeno,\\" sneered that it ought to have been: \\"Persaeus the Servant of Zeno.\\"Athenaeus, Deipnosophists, iv. 162 It is known that Antigonus II Gonatas invited Zeno to his court at Pella around 276 BC. Zeno refused because of his old age and sent his students Persaeus and Philonides of Thebes instead. While Persaeus was at Antigonus' court, Antigonus once, wishing to make trial of him, caused some false news to be brought to him that his estate had been ravaged by the enemy, and as his countenance fell, \\"Do you see,\\" said he, \\"that wealth is not a matter of indifference?\\"Diogenes Laertius, Lives of the Eminent Philosophers Book VII, Chapter 1, Section 36 Persaeus subsequently became an important figure at the Macedonian court.

The hotel was built by the first Japanese-American architect in Seattle, Sabro Ozasa, and contains the last remaining Japanese bathhouse (sento) in the United States. The Panama Hotel was essential to the Japanese community, the building housed businesses, a bathhouse, sleeping quarters for residents and visitors, and restaurants. Since 1985 the Panama Hotel has been owned by Jan Johnson. Johnson, the third owner of the Panama Hotel has restored the building to emulate its previous condition before the internment of Japanese Americans from Seattle. Johnson has closed off the basement that holds the belongings of the Japanese families to the public, and has installed a glass panel in the floorboards for visitors to view the artifacts from above. The Panama Hotel is known for the rich Japanese American history before and during World War II. The hotel is known for housing the belongings of the Japanese families in Seattle once Executive Order 9066 was enacted and the detention of Japanese in internment camps. After the Japanese American internment, most of the Seattle-based families were not able to return due to death, financial constraints, and relocation; their belongings still reside in the basement of the hotel. It is also known as being the namesake of the novel Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet by Jamie Ford. Panama and NP Hotels, side-by-side. Panama Hotel is at left.  Seattle's \\"Japantown\\" (Nihonmachi)  Located in the International District of Seattle, multiple districts were formed during the early 1900s based on race and ethnicity. Seattle's \\"Japantown\\" (Nihonmachi) community was established to keep races segregated, but it allowed cultural bonds to be formed. Japanese immigrants from all the regions of Japan came to Seattle and became interconnected because of the Nihonmachi. Even though the Japanese people of Japantown faced poverty due to economic hardships, skilled workers in all different industries came together because of the immigration from different prefectures in Japan.  Japanese Bathhouses (Sento)  The Panama Hotel was one of the focal points in Japantown before World War II. The hotel was known for the Hashidate-Yu, one of the four bathhouses (Sento) in Seattle during the early twentieth-century. Separated into two areas, one for men and the other for women and children, these bathhouses were essential in the Japantown because most of the residents did not have access to facilities in their residences. The bathhouses allowed people to interact with one another and spread their culture with the locals or visitors from other countries.  National Landmark  It was declared a National Historic Landmark building in 2006, and on April 9, 2015, the Panama Hotel was designated a National Treasure by the National Trust For Historic Preservation - one of only 60 in the United States.Note: A National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination document should be available upon request from the National Park Service for this site, but it appears not to be available on-line from the NPS Focus search site.

Its regular features include short articles, puzzles, jokes, and recipes. Andrews McMeel has also published several Mini Page spinoff books covering subjects such as the U.S. military, science, the states, history, geography and the environment. The supplement was conceived as a cross between the Weekly Reader and a newspaper comics section, with an underlying mission of encouraging family-centered reading and literacy. It was the first supplement of its kind when it debuted in August 1969 in the Raleigh, North Carolina News and Observer. The Mini Page's first issue had a \\"Back to School\\" theme and included a mini-profile of Los Angeles Rams quarterback Roman Gabriel and a \\"Faces in the News\\" section asking readers to identify a picture of Spiro Agnew. When Debnam created the Mini Page, she had been an elementary school teacher for twelve years and had never drawn before. Initially, she handled all tasks involved in the Mini Page's production, including researching, producing, laying out and editing all the content. She was also responsible for selling advertising, which is no longer included in the supplement. Debnam sold The Mini Page to Andrews McMeel in 2007 but continues to consult on the feature.

The game was originally released in Japan on June 25, 1998 and in North America on November 19, 1999, and subsequently re-released on the PlayStation Network in Japan on September 27, 2007 and in North America on March 31, 2015. In North America, the game was published by Agetec. Shadow Tower shares many similarities with the King's Field series of video games. A sequel, Shadow Tower Abyss, was released for the PlayStation 2 exclusively in Japan.  Gameplay  Shadow Tower is an action-oriented dungeon crawl very similar to King's Field. It features a first person style of gameplay where the player engages in combat with enemies, searches for hidden items and traps, and interacts with NPCs. Unlike most RPGs, it does not feature a system of experience points which the player character uses to grow more powerful. Instead all creatures are non-respawnable and every type of enemy killed will raise fixed stats on the player, so in order to increase specific stats a variety of different enemies need to be killed. The game also includes an item which allows the player to increase any stat by a few points manually, allowing for some character customization. A common issue for new players is that stat names don't refer to what they might be used to from other RPGs; for example, the stat Strength doesn't affect the character's attack power, but their hit points instead. Each piece of the character's equipment has a durability rating, meaning that it will wear down over time and must eventually be repaired or replaced. The game also features no music and no automap. Some differences from the previous King's Field installments are a shield that acts as an actual usable item that must be raised to block attacks, a more in-depth equipment screen, and the new progression system.  Plot  The game is set on the continent of Eclipse, in the Holy Land of Zeptar. The player takes the role of a mercenary named Ruus Hardy. Returning home to Zeptar, he finds that the entire city, as well as the central tower, have been sucked into the underworld. He meets an old man who gives him the Dark One's sword, the only weapon which can injure the demons responsible. Swearing to rescue the old woman who raised him, as well as the rest of Zeptar, Ruus descends into the underworld.  Development and release  Reception  The game received \\"unfavorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 27 out of 40.

When the gases are ignited, they burn, expand and propel the projectile out of the barrel with higher efficiency relative to solid propellant and have achieved higher muzzle velocities in experiments. Combustion light-gas gun technology is one of the areas being explored in an attempt to achieve higher velocities from artillery to gain greater range. Conventional guns use solid propellants, usually nitrocellulose-based compounds, to develop the chamber pressures needed to accelerate the projectiles. CLGGs' gaseous propellants are able to increase the propellant's specific impulse. Therefore, hydrogen is typically the first choice; however, other propellants like methane can be used. While this technology does appear to provide higher velocities, the main drawback with gaseous or liquid propellants for gun systems is the difficulty in getting uniform and predictable ignition and muzzle velocities. Variance with muzzle velocities affects precision in range, and the further a weapon shoots, the more significant these variances become. If an artillery system cannot maintain uniform and predictable muzzle velocities it will be of no use at longer ranges. Another issue is the survival of projectile payloads at higher accelerations. Fuzes, explosive fill, and guidance systems all must be \\"hardened\\" against the significant acceleration loads of conventional artillery to survive and function properly. Higher velocity weapons, like the CLGG, face these engineering challenges as they edge the boundaries of firing accelerations higher. The research and development firm UTRON, Inc is experimenting with a combustion light-gas gun design for field use. The corporation claims to have a system ready for testing as a potential long- range naval fire support weapon for emerging ships, such as the Zumwalt-class destroyer. The CLGG, like the railgun, is a possible candidate technology for greater ranges for naval systems, among others. UTRON has built and tested 45mm and 155mm combustion light-gas guns.

Background  Born in Grimsby, England, the daughter of a Scottish doctor, Ivy's lifelong love of nature was born in early childhood when she accompanied her father on outings into the bluebell woods and flower-filled meadows of the Lincolnshire countryside. Her father, a keen amateur botanist and entomologist, encouraged her to paint plants in a botanically accurate way. Showing a lively imagination, she started writing stories and drawing pictures, encouraged by her parents who recognised her talents and thought that she might become an artist. Educated locally, she later attended Harrogate Ladies College where she became well known for her drawings and playful poems. However, when she left school, Ivy became a successful actress with Felixstowe Repertory Theatre and Hull New Theatre Company. When the Second World War broke out, she joined the British film industry to make Ministry of Information films. Later in the War she joined the police and it was when working for them that she first thought of Pookie, the winged rabbit. While working on a police switchboard, she doodled a picture of a fairy sitting on a toadstool with a little rabbit in front and by chance it appeared that the wings belonged to the rabbit. She then decided that fairies were \\"two a penny\\" so she erased the fairy and kept the little winged rabbit. She named him Pookie because \\"he had a little pookie face\\" and wrote his story. It began ‚ÄúThis is the story of Pookie, a little white furry rabbit, with soft, floppity ears, big blue eyes and the most lovable rabbit smile in the world.‚Äù Ivy illustrated her stories with delicate, detailed watercolour paintings that perfectly captured her evocative tales. In 1945, just after war ended, encouraged by friends to find a publisher for her manuscript, she visited William Collins & Sons in London without an appointment. She was turned away, crestfallen, but asked to leave her manuscript. A few weeks later she was contacted by William Hope Collins and asked to attend the Glasgow office where the Children's Books section was based. Borrowing some money from her brother to buy a new dress and a 'big hat' to make her appear more 'serious', she took the train north to Glasgow. She met with William Hope Collins in the (now demolished) Cathedral Street offices and not only did William accept the book, he also fell in love with its author. In 1950 Ivy and William married and went to live in the Scottish Borders. They were a devoted couple and had two daughters Heather (b.1952) and Cherry (b.1956). Ivy founded her own company Pookie Productions Ltd. In all, she wrote ten 'Pookie' books as well as the highly successful 'Animal Shelf' series for younger children and 'The Young Warrenders' series for older ones. For over 20 years, Ivy's beautiful books became a publishing phenomenon and were worldwide bestsellers. Translated into several languages, Pookie was read as far afield as Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa. The stories were broadcast in Australia in Pookie's Half-Hour and thousands of children attended Pookie rallies. Ivy also enjoyed a successful career as a writer-illustrator for Wm Collins & Sons and for other international publishers. In 1950 she created the first baby record book 'Baby Days, A Record Year by Year'. In 1967, her husband died suddenly leaving Ivy heartbroken. She closed her studio, too consumed with grief to continue something that had meant so much to them both. Eventually in 1994, spurred on by decades of letters and pleas from fans now grown up and wishing to share Pookie with their own children, Ivy and her daughters relaunched Pookie Productions Ltd, and republished her books which once again became international bestsellers. The Animal Shelf, animated by award-winning Cosgrove Hall Films, was a Children's BAFTA-nominated TV series on CITV, running to 52 episodes and broadcast in over 50 countries. In 1997 Ivy was the subject of the BBC Scotland documentary ‚ÄúPookie Flies Again‚Äù. An exhibition of her life and work 'The Magical World of Pookie and The Animal Shelf' toured the UK from 1997 until 2000. Ivy retired at 85 and enjoyed spending time with her family and dogs and tending her beloved garden. She remained at her home near Biggar until 2002 when she moved to Auchlochan Garden Village where she died peacefully in her sleep at the age of 90. Pookie Productions Ltd is the copyright holder and worldwide licensing agent for Ivy Wallace's work including the Pookie series and The Animal Shelf series of children's books. Today vintage copies of Ivy's books as well as the more recently published editions are regarded as highly collectable.

The building  The building was insured since 1997, Reuters news service reported, with the total value of the contract at 12.3 billion Vietnamese ƒë·ªìng (800,000 USD).  Inferno  There are reports that there were about 1500 people shopping in the building when the fire started. State media said 120 people were injured in the fire which began at 1:15 p.m. local time (0615 GMT) on Tuesday. Initial reports indicated it may have been sparked by a short- circuit in the Blue Disco, one of the city's most popular dance spots, on the building's second floor. Intense heat and lingering flames prevented firefighters from entering the building for about four hours with firefighters taking more than five hours to extinguish the inferno. Bodies were still being recovered from the site late Tuesday though it is unclear whether any foreigners were among the dead or injured. It was reported that U.S. insurer American International Assurance was holding a training course for more than 100 staff at the time of the fire. There were also reports there was a wedding party in the building. On Wednesday, the building‚Äîwhich contains several floors of shops, around 50 offices and the disco and has a usual occupancy of about 1500 people‚Äîwas barricaded with police keeping onlookers at bay. At least five fire fighting vehicles were at the site on Wednesday though none were in use, a far cry from the scene on Tuesday when 30 fire engines and 40 ambulances surrounded the building. The Vietnam People's Army reported that firefighters were not fully equipped to fight the fire and lacked water to put out the flames. Power in the area was cut off and streets cordoned off. Flames raged at other windows sending dense black smoke into the sky as workers fled for their lives, many down steel ladders reaching up from fire trucks below. Others jumped out of the windows.  Aftermath  Two welders were later arrested. They had been working at the disco on the second floor, and it was suspected that sparks from their equipment may have started the blaze. Along with their supervisor and their employer, they were charged with \\"violating regulations of fire prevention and combating\\", and received sentences of 2 to 7 years in prison.\\"Culprits of ITC inferno receive 2 to 7-year prison sentences\\", Viet Nam News, June 14, 2004.

They are used as part of a cold chain to help maintain product freshness and efficacy. The term can also refer to insulated intermodal containers or insulated swap bodies. Construction Shipment of vaccine: PUR insulated box, gel packs, temperature monitor A variety of constructions have been developed. An insulated shipping container might be constructed of: # a vacuum flask, similar to a \\"thermos\\" bottle # fabricated thermal blankets or liners # molded expanded polystyrene foam (EPS, styrofoam), similar to a cooler # other molded foams such as polyurethane, polyethylene # sheets of foamed plastics # Vacuum Insulated Panels (VIPs) # reflective materials: (metallised film) # bubble wrap or other gas filled panels # other packaging materials and structures Some are designed for single use while others are returnable for reuse. Some insulated containers are decommissioned refrigeration units. Some empty containers are sent to the shipper disassembled or ‚Äúknocked down‚Äù, assembled and used, then knocked down again for easier return shipment. Shipping containers are available for maintaining cryogenic temperatures, with the use of liquid nitrogen. Some carriers have these as a specialized service Use United States Army Medical Materiel Agency video showing how containers are packed to maintain constant cold temperatures. Insulated shipping containers are part of a comprehensive cold chain which controls and documents the temperature of a product through its entire distribution cycle. The containers may be used with a refrigerant or coolant such as: * block or cube ice, slurry ice * dry ice * Gel or ice packs (often formulated for specific temperature ranges) * Phase change materials (PCMs) * Some products (such as frozen meat) have sufficient thermal mass to contribute to the temperature control and no excess coolant is required A digital Temperature data logger or a time temperature indicator is often enclosed to monitor the temperature inside the container for its entire shipment. Labels and appropriate documentation (internal and external) are usually required. Personnel throughout the cold chain need to be aware of the special handling and documentation required for some controlled shipments. With some regulated products, complete documentation is required. Design and evaluation The use of ‚Äúoff the shelf‚Äù insulated shipping containers does not necessarily guarantee proper performance. Several factors need to be considered: * the sensitivity of the product to temperatures (high and low) and to time at temperatures * the specific distribution system being used: the expected (and worst case) time and temperatures * regulatory requirements * the specific combination of packaging components and materials being used In specifying an insulated shipping container, the two primary characteristics of the material are its thermal conductivity or R-value, and its thickness. These two attributes will help determine the resistance to heat transfer from the ambient environment into the payload space. The coolant material load temperature, quantity, latent heat, and sensible heat will help determine the amount of heat the parcel can absorb while maintaining the desired control temperature. Combining the attributes from the insulator and coolant will allow analysis of expected duration of the insulated shipping container system. Testing of multi-component systems is needed. It is wise (and sometimes mandatory) to have formal verification of the performance of the insulated shipping container. Laboratory package testing might include ASTM D3103-07, Standard Test Method for Thermal Insulation Performance of Packages, ISTA Guide 5B: Focused Simulation Guide for Thermal Performance Testing of Temperature Controlled Transport Packaging, and others. In addition, validation of field performance (performance qualification) is extremely useful. Specialists in design and testing of packaging for temperature sensitive products are often needed. These may be consultants, independent laboratories, universities, or reputable vendors. Many laboratories have certifications and accreditations: ISO 9000s, ISO/IEC 17025, etc.  Environmental Impact  Parcel to pallet sized insulated shipping containers have historically been single-use products due to the low-cost material composition of EPS and water-based gel packs. The insulation material typically finds its way into landfill streams as it is not readily recyclable in the United States. The development of reusable high-performance shipping containers have been shown to reduce packing waste by 95% while also contributing significant savings to other environmental pollutants.

Biography=Early life Anderson is a native of the U.S. state of Connecticut. Professional skateboarding Anderson attained professional status in around August 1998 while riding for Toy Machine and was named Thrasher magazine's \\"Skater of the Year\\" the following year after he joined the Girl Skateboards team. The magazine's editor-in-chief explained: > When I first saw him, it was a picture of a frontside bluntslide at Hubba > Hideout. This barbaric dude that was obviously larger than life. He just > walked right into the spotlight from working 70 hours as a line cook, to > being the hottest thing in skateboarding. On August 23, 2013, Anderson's inaugural Nike SB signature model shoe the \\"Project BA\\" was launched in New York City, US. The event was held at the Ludlow Studios Gallery in the Lower East Side and heavy metal band Unlocking the Truth provided the musical entertainment for the attendees. Nike SB designer Fabricio Costa used sketches that were drawn by Anderson to create a skate shoe with a \\"runner-like upturned toe\\" that is designed specifically for flip tricks. Sponsors As of January 1, 2016, Anderson is sponsored by Anti Hero Skateboards, Nike SB, Independent, Labor Skateboard Shop, Spitfire, and Bones. Personal life In September 2016, Anderson came out as gay, saying that it was something that he knew from a young age. Anderson revealed that he was \\"totally scared\\" as a young adult, and chose to hide because he thought it would have a negative effect on his career and that it would be dangerous to talk about in the macho skateboarding world. He hopes to encourage others to come out with the message \\"it gets better.\\" Art Anderson is an amateur artist and has contributed graphics for Girl's skateboard products. In 2013, Anderson revealed his intention to initiate his own creative skateboard venture as part of his departure from Girl: > Throughout my career I have valued sharing my creative output with the > companies that have supported me, and I knew that one day I would want to > direct this energy toward a project of my own. That time has arrived. > Although it has been a difficult decision, I'm looking forward to this new > endeavor. Company owner During a period when established riders left board companies that they had been with for lengthy periods of time‚Äîfor example, Jason Dill's departure from Alien Workshop and Jerry Hsu's from Enjoi‚ÄîAnderson amicably resigned from the Girl skateboard company to commence his own skateboard deck brand, entitled \\"3D Skateboards.\\" In response to a question about the situation at Girl prior to his departure, Anderson explained: > There was absolutely nothing wrong with the way things were going with Girl. > That‚Äôs why it was hard to go through with everything because we‚Äôre all > really close friends and I love those guys so much. I just felt like I > wanted to do something for myself, instead of in a few years realizing that > I can‚Äôt jump down stairs when I‚Äôm 45 ... Following his decision to leave Girl, Anderson revealed in a later interview that he \\"went to LA to talk to Girl about it and told them I‚Äôm getting older and I wanted to do my own thing. And it wasn‚Äôt fun for any of us ... I just wanna convey how much I love those guys, there was absolutely nothing wrong and I‚Äôm glad they are my friends.\\" Anderson left the Girl team on May 16, 2013 after over a decade with the company. As of September 1, 2013, Anderson remains on the Fourstar clothing brand that is distributed by Girl. Initially, Anderson recruited Alex Olson, who left Girl shortly after Anderson, and Austyn Gillette, who left Habitat to join the company of his close friend that \\"would be fun at this point in life.\\" However, Olson departed shortly afterwards to start his own board company, as 3D \\"just kinda looked like Girl,\\" and Anderson and Olson \\"had two different visions.\\" Anderson partnered with fellow former Toy Machine pro and skateboard company owner Brad Staba of the SkateMental brand, with 3D's distribution also administrated by SkateMental's proprietor, Big Time Distribution. A rumor that implicated Nike, Inc. in the development of the company was refuted by Anderson in an August 2013 interview, \\"Nike doesn‚Äôt do hardgoods.

He played professionally for the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles during a seven-season National Football League (NFL) career that spanned from 1941 to 1951. Reagan served as the head football coach at Villanova University from 1954 to 1959, compiling a record of 16‚Äì36. He was also Villanova's athletic director from 1957 to 1961. Early life and playing career Born in Philadelphia, Reagan was a star quarterback and defensive back at Northeast Catholic High School and led the team to championships in 1935 and 1936. He was voted 1st Team All-Scholastic by the Philadelphia Bulletin in his senior year. Reagan then played college football at the University of Pennsylvania. Standing 5'11\\" and 182 lbs., Reagan was a varsity player during George Munger's first three seasons as head coach of the Penn Quakers, from 1938 to 1940. Reagan's 135 points scored is still ninth all-time in UPenn history and his 103 points scored as a senior is the second most in one season in over 120 years of Penn football. Reagan had one of the great individual performances of all time against Princeton on October 19, 1940, rushing for 200 yards, scoring five touchdowns and 31 points in a 46‚Äì28 victory at Franklin Field. In a game at Michigan in 1938, Reagan was responsible for 356 total yards, rushing for 85, passing for 188, returning kickoffs for 82 and punts for 21. Reagan was named a 1st Team All-American Back for the 1940 season. A captain of both the football and baseball teams, he was awarded the 1941 \\"Class of 1915 Award\\" as that member of the senior class who, \\"most closely approaches the ideal University of Pennsylvania student-athlete\\". Sportswriter Grantland Rice called him \\"one of the two best running backs in college football\\", the other being Heisman Trophy winner Tom Harmon of the University of Michigan. Reagan was drafted in the second round of the 1941 NFL Draft by the New York Giants. After an outstanding rookie season his pro career was interrupted by his military service during World War II. Upon returning to the NFL he led the league in interceptions in 1947. He was traded to the Eagles after the 1948 season and was a big factor in helping the Eagles repeat as NFL Champions in 1949. He played starting safety and recorded seven interceptions. He also punted for a 45-yard average and returned punts for 12.7 yards per return and one touchdown. During his pro career Reagan averaged 40.9 yards on 224 career punts. He finished his NFL career with 35 interceptions. He also scored six touchdowns on offense and threw a touchdown pass. Coaching and administrative career, later life, honors Following his retirement as a player and a brief tenure as an assistant coach of the Eagles, Reagan went on to become head coach at Villanova University in 1954. He stayed in that position until 1959. He remained the school's athletic director until 1961 when he went into partnership in an insurance brokerage firm in Norristown, Pennsylvania. Reagan died of complications of lung cancer at age 53 in 1972.\\"Ex-Football Star, Frank Reagan, Dies\\", The Southern Illinoisan, November 21, 1972, Carbondale, Illinois He is enshrined in both the Northeast Catholic HS Hall of Fame and the University of Pennsylvania Hall of Fame.

From the 2017‚Äì18 season, the bottom club after the regular season is relegated to Pro D2 and replaced by the Pro D2 champion, now determined by a six-team knockout playoff. The second-from- bottom Top 14 side enters a playoff with the runner-up of the Pro D2 playoffs, with the winner either remaining in or promoted to Top 14. Since the 2009‚Äì10, the knock-out stages for the Top 14 have involved six teams and consist of three rounds. The top two teams on the ladder receive a bye into the semi- finals, while the next four teams on the ladder play in the first round, with the third-and fourth-place teams each hosting a match. The winners of those matches face the top two teams in the semi-finals, which are held at neutral sites, and the semi-final winners advance to the final at Stade de France (the traditional site, although the 2016 final was held at Camp Nou in Barcelona due to conflict with UEFA Euro 2016). With Europe's former top club competition, the Heineken Cup, being superseded by the European Rugby Champions Cup from 2014‚Äì15, the qualification method for all nations changed slightly. This, however, did not affect the number of French teams assured of Champions Cup qualification‚Äîas in the Heineken Cup era (1996‚Äì2014), six Top 14 teams are assured of Champions Cup places in the following season. Currently, the top six teams on the Top 14 table earn Champions Cup places. A seventh French club can qualify by winning a play-off following the club season. From the 2016‚Äì17 season forward, this playoff will involve the seventh-place teams from the Top 14 and English Premiership, plus the top two teams from Pro14 that (1) did not automatically qualify for the Champions Cup and (2) are not from South Africa. All Top 14 teams that do not qualify for the Champions Cup, including the teams newly promoted from Pro D2, will play in the Challenge Cup. Pro D2 Pro D2 is the second level of domestic club rugby, below the first division, Top 14. At present, 16 clubs compete in the competition. Beginning in 2017‚Äì18, Pro D2 adopted a playoff system identical to that used by the Top 14, with the first- and second-place teams receiving byes into the semifinals, where they await winners of quarterfinals that involve the third- through sixth-place teams. The winner of the playoff becomes the league champion and receives automatic promotion to the next season's Top 14; the runner-up enters a playoff with the 13th-place team from Top 14, with the winner either remaining in or promoted to Top 14. This replaced a system in which the top club at the end of the season was automatically promoted to the Top 14, with the 2nd through 5th place teams playing each other for the second promotion place. The bottom two are automatically relegated to F√©d√©rale 1. Effective in 2017‚Äì18, the teams involved in the next Pro D2 season are: * The bottom club of the previous Top 14 season. * The loser of the previous season's promotion/relegation playoff. * The remaining entrants in the Pro D2 playoffs, plus all other teams finishing 14th or better in Pro D2. * The champion of F√©d√©rale 1. * Through 2019‚Äì20, one \\"wild card\\" promotion from F√©d√©rale 1, as determined by LNR. Only teams from northern France (with the dividing line running roughly from La Rochelle to Lyon) are eligible to receive this promotion place. The \\"wild card\\" promotion is part of an LNR initiative to expand the sport outside of its traditional southern base, which will also include a third fully professional league below Pro D2 planned for a 2020‚Äì21 launch. F√©d√©rale 1 Preliminary phase 8 teams compete on a round- robin basis (14 games) in each of the 4 groups. The top 4 teams of each group move into the play-offs (Troph√©e Jean-Prat), the bottom 4 move into play-downs Second phase *Play-downs The lowest ranked 24 teams from the preliminary phase play another round-robin competition in 4 groups of 6. Points scored in the preliminary phase are kept. Teams only play teams from other groups. The top 2 teams of each group move on to a sudden death competition (quarter-finals, semi-finals, final), at the end of which an honorary title is awarded. The bottom 3 teams of each group (12 in all) are relegated to F√©d√©rale 2. *Play- offs The top 24 teams from the preliminary phase play another round-robin competition in 6 groups of 4. Points scored in the preliminary phase are not kept. Teams only play teams from other groups. The best four top clubs are automatically qualified for the quarter finals. The other two top clubs and the six n¬∞2 clubs have to fight it out in a play-off game to get into the quarter finals. The two finalists are promoted to Pro D2 and play for the championship. In the past, the losing semifinalists played for a third ticket to Pro D2, but no longer do so after the operator of the professional leagues, LNR, reduced the number of promotion places to two. At the end of each season, two teams are promoted to Pro D2, and 12 relegated into F√©d√©rale 2. F√©d√©rale 2 F√©d√©rale 2 is the fourth division of rugby above F√©d√©rale 3. Teams can earn promotion to F√©d√©rale 1. F√©d√©rale 3 F√©d√©rale 3 is the fifth division of rugby union in France. The competition involves a very large number of clubs, and winners can progress up into higher division of competition. The competition above F√©d√©rale 3 is F√©d√©rale 2.

The war resulted in the restoration of Dominican sovereignty, the withdrawal of Spanish forces, the separation of the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo from Spain, and the establishment of a second republic in the Dominican Republic.  Background  General Pedro Santana had wrested the presidency from Buenaventura B√°ez, who had bankrupted the nation's treasury at great profit to himself. Faced with an economic crisis as well as the possibility of renewed attack from Haiti, Santana asked Spain to retake control of the country, after a period of only 17 years of independence. Spain was wary at first, but with the U.S. occupied with its own civil war and unable to enforce the Monroe Doctrine, it felt it had an opportunity to reassert control in Latin America. On March 18, 1861, the annexation was announced, and Santana became Governor-General of the newly created province. However, this act was not well received by everyone. On May 2, General Jos√© Contreras led a failed rebellion, and Francisco del Rosario S√°nchez led an invasion from Haiti (who were officially neutral, but also concerned about Spain flexing its muscles in the area), but he was captured and executed on July 4, 1861. Santana himself did not fare well under the new regime. He discovered that he was unable to wield the same amount of power under Spanish rule as he could as president of an independent nation, and resigned his post in January 1862. Spanish officials began to alienate the general population by instituting a policy known as bagajes, which required citizens to hand over any work animals to the Spanish military upon demand without any guarantee of compensation. This was especially problematic in the Cibao region in the north, where farmers depended on their animals for their livelihoods. A second factor was cultural: the new archbishop from Spain was appalled to find that a large number of Dominican couples were not married within the Catholic Church. This situation had come about due to a small number of priests in the country, as well as poverty and the lack of roads and transportation to get to a church for marriage. With the best of intentions, Archbishop Bienvenido de Monz√≥n wanted to rectify this situation within a short time, but his demands only irritated the local population, who had come to accept the current state of illegitimate births as normal. Economically, the new government also imposed higher tariffs on non-Spanish goods and ships and attempted to establish a monopoly on tobacco, thus alienating the merchant classes as well. By late 1862, Spanish officials were beginning to fear the possibility of rebellion in the Cibao region (anti-Spanish feelings were not as strong in the south). Lastly, despite explicit statements to the contrary, rumors spread that Spain would re-institute slavery and ship black Dominicans to Cuba and Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, Spain had issued a royal order in January 1862 declaring its intent to regain the territories that Toussaint Louverture had taken for Haiti in 1794. In attempting to quell disturbances in Dominica, Spanish troops had evicted Haitians living in these areas along the Haitian‚ÄìDominican border. Haitian president Fabre Geffrard gave up his position of neutrality and began to aid the Dominican rebels.  War  On August 16, 1863, a new group under the leadership of Santiago Rodr√≠guez made a daring raid on Capotillo near Dajab√≥n and raised the new Dominican flag on the Capotillo hill. This action, known as El grito de Capotillo, was the beginning of the war. Town after town in Cibao joined the rebellion, and on September 3, a force of 6,000 Dominicans under Commander-in-Chief General Gaspar Polanco besieged Fort San Luis and its 800 Spanish soldiers in Santiago, capturing it on September 13. The rebels established a new government the following day, with Jos√© Antonio Salcedo as self-appointed president, and immediately denounced Santana, who was now leading the Spanish forces, as a traitor. Salcedo attempted to engage the U.S. for assistance, but was rebuffed. Spain had a difficult time fighting the rebels. Over the course of the war, they would spend over 33 million pesos and suffer over 10,000 casualties (much of it due to yellow fever). Santana, who had previously been revered as a superb military tactician, found himself unable to break the Dominican resistance. In March 1864, he pointedly disobeyed orders to concentrate his forces around Santo Domingo and was rebuked and relieved of his command by Governor-General Jos√© de la G√°ndara, who ordered Santana to Cuba in order to face a court- martial. However, Santana died suddenly before this happened. La G√°ndara attempted to broker a cease-fire with the rebels. He and Salcedo agreed to discuss peace terms, but in the middle of negotiations, Salcedo was overthrown and assassinated by the disaffected group of Restoration commanders led by Gaspar Polanco. Polanco was concerned that Salcedo was taking negligent actions against the Spanish authorities, made numerous costly military mistakes and was planning to recall former pro-annexation president Buenaventura B√°ez, whom the rebels hated as much as they hated the Spanish for his actions before Santana's July 1857 coup. Although B√°ez had initially opposed Spanish annexation, once it began he lived in Spain on a government subsidy and had the honorary rank of field marshal in the Spanish Army. It was not until near the end of the war that he returned to the Dominican Republic. In Spain, the war was proving to be extremely unpopular. Combined with other political crises that were happening, it contributed to the downfall of Spanish Prime Minister Leopoldo O'Donnell in 1866. Spain's Minister of War ordered the cessation of military operations on the island while new Prime Minister Ram√≥n Mar√≠a Narv√°ez brought the issue before the Cortes Generales. Polanco's reign was short-lived. After an ill-fated attack on the Spanish position in Monte Cristi and efforts to establish a tobacco monopoly on behalf of his friends, he himself was overthrown by a movement supported by his own brother General Juan Antonio Polanco, Pedro Antonio Pimentel and Benito Moncion who appointed Benigno Filomeno de Rojas as president and Gregorio Luper√≥n as vice-president in January 1865. Given the respite in fighting, the provisional junta organized a new constitution, and when that was adopted, General Pedro Antonio Pimentel became the new president effective March 25, 1865. By this time, the outcome of the American Civil War was no longer in serious doubt. On the other side of the Atlantic, the Cortes now had to consider the probability of eventual U.S. intervention and decided it did not want to fund a war for a territory it did not really need. On March 3, 1865, Queen Isabella II signed the annulment of the annexation. By July 15, there were no more Spanish troops left on the island.  Aftermath  Monument to the Dominican War of Restoration Although many Dominican cities were destroyed and agriculture across the country (apart from tobacco) halted during the war years, the War of Restoration brought a new level of national pride to the Dominican Republic. The Dominican victory also showed nationalists in Cuba and Puerto Rico that Spain could be defeated. On the other hand, in local politics, leadership during the war was concentrated in the hands of a few regional caudillos, or strongmen, who could command the loyalty of the regions and who were more intent on bettering themselves and their followers than the nation as a whole. This system of political power persisted until the late 20th century. Dominican politics remained unstable for the next several years. Pimentel was president for only five months before he was replaced by Jos√© Mar√≠a Cabral. Cabral in turn was ousted by Buenaventura B√°ez in December 1865, but retook the presidency in May 1866. His negotiations with the United States about the possible sale of land around Saman√° Bay proved to be so unpopular that B√°ez was able to regain the presidency once more in 1868. In intra-island relations, the war marked a new level of cooperation between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Until now, Haiti had considered the island of Hispaniola to be \\"indivisible\\" and had unsuccessfully attempted to conquer the eastern half several times before. The war forced Haiti to realize that this goal was essentially unattainable, and was instead replaced by years of border disputes between the two countries. August 16 is commemorated a national holiday in the Dominican Republic, as well as the day the Dominican president is sworn into office every four years.

VQP is a Cisco-only protocol that is supported only by older switches running CatOS. Many vendors (including Cisco) have turned to support dynamic VLAN assignments using the 802.1x authentication protocol with a Radius server that has additional attributes designating the VLAN. Details Upon physically connecting a device to a port of a switch configured as a VLAN Management Policy Server (VMPS) client, the switch begins listening for packets, and encapsulates and rebroadcasts the first packet received into a VQP packet, which is sent to one of up to two configured VMPS servers on port udp/1589. The VMPS server will give one of 4 responses (\`Allow\`, \`Deny\`, \`Shutdown\`, \`Wrong_Domain\`) and the switch will either assign the port to the appropriate VLAN, put the port back into the pre-confirmation state, shut down the port until the device or another one is physically reconnected, or log an error indicating that it is incorrectly configured. The latter result is often due to Cisco documentation failing to mention that the domain name in the VMPS configuration file must match the VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) domain name. If reconfirmation of VLAN assignment is required, it is done in the same manner as initial confirmation, with the exception of including the currently assigned VLAN for the port in the VQP packet. Reconfirmation is done periodically based on configuration directives of the client switches, or can be forced with a switch command line directive. The VQP Protocol has no checksums, encryption or authentication of either the client or the switch messages. The protocol also does not include scope to send a message to the server informing that a device has been disconnected.

Nassim was held in Guantanamo for 3 years, 8 months, and 22 days until his death by apparent suicide. mirror The US claims he admitted being an al Qaeda leader, but Nassim denied this in numerous interrogation sessions. The US military claims he was headquartered in Zahedan, Iran. Nassim was the 19th captive to have been transferred to Guantanamo since September 6, 2006. Prior to the transfer on that date of fourteen high value detainees, who had previously been held elsewhere in secret detention centers run by the CIA, the USA had not transferred any captives to Guantanamo since the United States Supreme Court ruling in Rasul v. Bush (2004). The court ruled that foreign nationals (non-US citizens) held in Guantanamo Bay had the right of habeas corpus in US courts to challenge their imprisonments. In late November 2008, the New York Times published a page summarizing the official documents related to each captive. The New York Times said that no further official records of his detention and only in March 2019 were his Combatant Status Review Tribunal findings published. They identified him as captive 10028 (not 10029, as published incorrectly elsewhere, including earlier versions of this Wikipedia page). Detention in Guantanamo The detainee spent long periods of time in Guantanamo's Psychiatric Ward. The detainee called Inayatullah was later identified as a native-born Afghani named Hajji Nassim, according to his lawyer.Carol Rosenberg, \\"Latest Guant√°namo prison camp suicide was 'indefinite detainee'\\" , Miami Herald, at McClatchy website, 28 June 2011, accessed 3 January 2013, mirror He was arrested in an Iranian border town near Afghanistan in 2007. His attorney said he operated a cellphone store there. He was transferred after that date to Guantanamo, after having been held elsewhere by the US. He was among 19 persons transferred to the camp after September 6, 2006. On May 18, 2011, Inayatullah was found dead at approximately 3:50am in the small recreation \\"pen\\" outside his cell in Guantanamo's Camp Echo. The cause of his death was hanging, and the US military released a statement saying that he died in an \\"apparent suicide\\". It said he had been an emir and a member of Al Qaeda. He was the eighth prisoner to die at Guantanamo; five of the previous deaths were reported by the Department of Defense (DOD) as suicides. Three of these were contested as manslaughter in an award-winning article by Harper's Magazine in January 2010, based on accounts by four soldiers who had been serving at the camp at the time of the deaths in June 2006. At least one of the other deaths was highly suspicious, with the prisoner, Abdul Rahman Al Amri, found hanging from an air vent in his cell with his hands tied \\"snugly\\" behind his back. On June 28, 2011, Carol Rosenberg, writing in the Miami Herald, reported that Pentagon spokesman Dave Oten confirmed that Inayatullah had been classed as an \\"indefinite detainee\\" by the Obama administration. mirror Reuters, \\"Afghan Detainee Is Found Dead at Guantanamo\\", New York Times, 18 May 2011, mirror, accessed 3 January 2013 \\"Indefinite detainee\\" was a new designation used by the joint interagency review boards which President Obama authorized for those captives who had not committed a crime for which they could face charges, but who were not considered safe to release. Rosenberg quoted doubts expressed by the American Paul Rashkind, Inayatullah's attorney, about the DoD's account. Rashkind told Rosenberg that the man was named Hajji Nassim and that he was not known as \\"Inayatullah\\" anywhere other than at Guantanamo. He had not been an \\"emir\\". Rashkind confirmed that his client had been living in an Iranian border town near Afghanistan when he was arrested, where he had operated a cellphone store. He had no ties to al Qaeda, the Taliban, or terrorism. Rashkind told Rosenberg that Nassim had a history of mental illness and had spent long periods in Guantanamo's Psychiatric Ward. He had brought a third- party specialist in to help treat his client, and the attorney had planned to have a psychiatric profile completed, believing that would have helped him be cleared by DOD for release. Rashkind confirmed that his client had made earlier suicide attempts, and he did not doubt that his death was suicide. Declassified documents, including a U.S. Army report on Nassim's death, were released along with an article by Jeffrey Kaye at Medium.com, and lent a great deal of new material to understand Nassim's detention and death at Guantanamo. For instance, it was revealed that Nassim made two prior serious attempts at self-harm at Guantanamo before he died, including cutting his neck. He was psychiatrically hospitalized in Guantanamo's Behavioral Health Unit for 19 months, from March 2009 to October 2010. Nassim expressed many times that he was worried that any cooperation he might offer the Americans would endanger him or his family back in Afghanistan. In fact, in March 2009 he was attacked by another detainee who accused him of being an American spy. For their part, interrogators seemed to never feel that Nassim was telling them the whole truth. But Nassim's attorney wrote in a filing with the government, criticizing ‚Äúthe coercive conditions of Mr. Nassim‚Äôs confinement and interrogation sessions,‚Äù citing specifically threats of beating, threats of imprisoning his family, sleep deprivation, and confinement in small, dark cells. In an interview with defense-provided psychiatrist Emily Keram, MD on November 10, 2010, Naseem indicated that he cooperated with the Americans in interrogation back when he was first incarcerated at Bagram Detention Center in Afghanistan because of harsh, torturous treatment there, including sleep deprivation, confinement in a small, dark cell, and threats made against him and his family. In June 2008, Nassim appeared somewhat reluctantly at his Combatant Status Review Tribunal. He told the government there, as a government report described it, that \\"he was innocent and the charges against him were baseless.\\" Joint Review Task Force When he assumed office in January 2009 President Barack Obama made a number of promises about the future of Guantanamo. He promised the use of torture would cease at the camp. He promised to institute a new review system. That new review system was composed of officials from six departments, where the OARDEC reviews were conducted entirely by the Department of Defense. When it reported back, a year later, the Joint Review Task Force classified some individuals as too dangerous to be transferred from Guantanamo, even though there was no evidence to justify laying charges against them. On April 9, 2013, that document was made public after a Freedom of Information Act request. Muhammad Rahim was one of the 71 individuals deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release. Although Obama promised that those deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release would start to receive reviews from a Periodic Review Board less than a quarter of men have received a review.

Biography Turner was educated at Wentworth Military Academy in Lexington, Missouri. In 1918, he left the academy to join the Marine Corps in the First World War, but the war ended before he was able to go overseas to join in the fighting. During the 1920s he moved to California, where he worked as a legal secretary for a law office. When the U.S. entered the Second World War, Turner volunteered once again to defend his country. He joined the Army from Los Angeles in October 1942,WWII Army Enlistment Records and was assigned to the 14th Armored Division. For his actions on January 3, 1945, he received the Medal of Honor on August 23, 1945. Medal of Honor citation His MOH citation read: ‚ÄúThe President of the United States takes pleasure in awarding the MEDAL of HONOR to PRIVATE FIRST CLASS GEORGE B. TURNER, BTRY. C, 499th ARMORED FIELD ARTILLERY BN. UNITED STATES ARMY for service as set forth in the following CITATION: :Private Turner, at Phillippsbourg, France, on 3 January 1945 was cut off from his artillery unit by an enemy armored infantry attack. Coming upon a friendly infantry company withdrawing under the vicious onslaught, he noticed two German tanks and approximately seventy-five supporting foot soldiers advancing down the main street of the village. Seizing a rocket launcher, he advanced under intense small arms and cannon fire to meet the tanks and standing in the middle of the road, fired at them, destroying one and disabling the second. From a nearby half-track he then dismounted a machine gun, placed it in the open street and fired into the enemy infantrymen, killing or wounding a great number and breaking up the attack. In the American counterattack which followed, two supporting tanks were disabled by an enemy antitank gun. Firing a light machine gun from the hip, Private Turner held off the enemy so that the crews of the disabled vehicles could extricate themselves. He ran through a hail of fire to one of the tanks which had burst into flames and attempted to rescue a man who had been unable to escape; but an explosion of the tank‚Äôs ammunition frustrated his effort and wounded him painfully. Refusing to be evacuated, he remained with the infantry until the following day, driving off an enemy patrol with serious casualties, assisting in capturing a hostile strong point and voluntarily and fearlessly driving a truck through heavy enemy fire to deliver wounded men to the rear aid station. The great courage displayed by Private Turner and his magnificently heroic initiative contributed materially to the defense of the French town and inspired the troops about him.‚Äù Turner was the only recipient of the Medal of Honor from the 14th Armored Division during World War II.

Truman remarked while presenting Turner the Medal of Honor: \\"I would rather have that medal than be president of the United States.\\" See also *List of Medal of Honor recipients for World War II References ;Notes ;Sources *Wentworth Military Academy Trumpeter, 1986.

Fifteen Years Later (also titled as I Dream of Jeannie: 15 Years Later) is a 1985 American made-for-television fantasy-comedy film produced by Columbia Pictures Television which premiered on NBC on October 20, 1985. It is the first of two reunion films based on the 1965‚Äì1970 sitcom I Dream of Jeannie. Barbara Eden reprises her role as the magical Jeannie; also reprising their roles from the original series were Bill Daily as Tony's fellow astronaut and best friend Roger Healy, and Hayden Rorke (in his final film role) as NASA psychiatrist Dr. Alfred Bellows. The role of Tony Nelson was played by Wayne Rogers, best known for his role as Trapper John McIntyre on the 1970s series M*A*S*H. Larry Hagman was unavailable to reprise his role as Tony Nelson reportedly because he was too busy filming his CBS series Dallas at the time. The film was directed by William Asher (who was also the main director of the 1960s show Bewitched) and the teleplay was written by Irma Kalish. Plot Jeannie has been a happily married housewife for 15 years to her astronaut husband Tony Nelson and has a teenage son, T.J. When Tony is promoted to Colonel and is about to retire from the NASA space program, Jeannie decides to give him a celebration party in their backyard. However, egged on by his colleagues to retire with a dramatic flair, Tony breaks his promise to Jeannie for one more space flight (aboard the shuttle), this time with a female astronaut, Captain Nelly Hunt. Jeannie is furious, so she decides to separate from her husband temporarily to be a more independent modern woman. In the meantime, Jeannie's always-scheming evil sister, Jeannie II is determined to have Tony for herself and she teams up with Haji, the chief genie (operating a fitness gym in the United States), to break up her sister's marriage. Jeannie II traps her sister in a bottle with a special stopper, that nobody but another genie could open. Meanwhile, Tony's space flight is in trouble; the engines won't fire and the shuttle is on a collision course with a meteoroid. When T.J. comes home and hears his mother trapped in the bottle, he attempts to open the bottle. At first, the stopper would not move, but his mother encouraged him to blink, like she does to invoke her powers. Jeannie encourages her son to concentrate and to blink again, this time the stopper moves. T.J. discovers that he had inherited his mother's powers and is a genie, himself. (Earlier on, T.J. sees his mother using her powers and she explains to him about his heritage, and revealing that she is a genie, and how she became a genie. She also blinked T.J. with her back to the day when she first met Tony.) After blinking, and releasing his mother from her prison, Jeannie and T.J. go to Haji, explaining the trick. Rules must have changed since 1970, because Jeannie now needs special dispensation from the chief of genies in order to do something major, like saving a human life. Haji gives Jeannie a magic amulet and tells her to blink three times during the full moon while holding it. If she does this, Tony and the shuttle crew will be saved. But the magic comes at a terrible price‚Äîevery mortal that has ever known Jeannie and T.J., including Tony, will forget that they even exist. T.J. tells his mother that they will lose dad either way, so they might as well do it so Tony lives. Jeannie invokes her magic, saving the shuttle from certain doom, and it is able to return to the ground. However, Jeannie got Haji to agree to one final night together for her and Tony, allowing Jeannie to say farewell to Tony in her heart. The next morning, while Tony is asleep,Jeannie alters the bedroom and then the house to what it might look like if Tony was a bachelor. With T.J., Jeannie moves on with her life. The final scene shows Jeannie and Tony passing each other on the street, and Jeannie magically gets Tony's attention, indicating that they will in fact find each other again. Before the movie ends, Jeannie breaks the fourth wall and says to the viewers, \\"Haji made me agree to an ending. He never said there couldn't be a new beginning.\\" The movie ends with Tony following Jeannie down the street.

Career Capture of Weser: On 30 September 1813, the , under the command of capitaine de vaisseau Cantzlaat, Chevalier de l'Ordre Imp√©rial de la R√©union, sailed from the Texel for the North Sea. There she captured two Swedish ships before a gale on 16 October took away her main and mizzen mast. Two days later , Commander Colin Macdonald, captain, encountered her 60 leagues west of Ushant, making her way towards Brest under jury main and mizzen masts. Rather than engage her and risk being crippled and so unable to follow her given the weather, Macdonald decided to follow her. Fortuitously, on 20 October, , Commander J.J. Gordon Bremer, captain, arrived and Macdonald and Bremer decided to attack Weser. They engaged her for about an hour and a half before they had to withdraw to repair their rigging. At about this time a third British vessel, Rippon, Captain Christopher Cole, came up. Bremer joined Cole and informed him of the situation while Scylla remained with Weser. The next morning, as Rippon and Royalist sailed towards Scylla to renew their attack, Weser sailed towards Rippon and struck, after first firing two broadsides towards Scylla. Scylla suffered only two men wounded in the entire engagement. Royalist suffered more heavily, having two men killed and nine wounded. Weser lost four men killed and 15 wounded. Rippon took Wesers crew on board as prisoners and towed her into port. The Royal Navy took her into service as HMS Weser. In 1814 Rippon sailed with troops to North America. Fate Rippon was paid off into Ordinary in August 1814. Two years later she was roofed over. She was broken up in March 1821.

The party also continued to support Romano Prodi's government, but distanced from it on some issues, notably foreign policy and social security reform. One of the early goals of the LD was challenging the \\"statist illusion which survives in the DS and DL\\" and what they described as the hegemony of the far-left over the centre-left and the government. Dini's move was criticised by leftists who accused him of preparing Berlusconi's return in office. On 24 January 2008 the LD, with the notable exception of D'amico and along with Clemente Mastella's Union of Democrats for Europe and Domenico Fisichella (a former leader of the conservative National Alliance who had been elected with DL in 2008), joined the opposition in voting against the government in a vote of confidence in the Senate. Consequently, Prodi resigned from Prime Minister and a snap election was called. In February the party joined The People of Freedom (PdL), the new broad centre-right party launched by Berlusconi. This led D'Amico to switch to the PD and Monteleone to the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC). In the following general election, four Liberal Democrats were elected in the lists of the PdL: Dini to the Senate, Tanoni, Scalera and Melchiorre to the Chamber of Deputies. In May Dini, who was re-elected President of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate, and Scalera decided to leave the LD and join directly the PdL, while Tanoni, Melchiorre and others decided to hold on and to organise the LD as an independent centrist party allied to PdL.ALICE Notizie Melchiorre was thus elected party president, succeeding to Dini. In July Melchiorre and Tanoni formed a joint-group within the Mixed Group of the Chamber along with Francesco Nucara of the Italian Republican Party. Some months later the pair started to be very critical of Berlusconi IV Cabinet and joined the opposition in several key votes. In the 2009 European Parliament election the party formed an alliance with the Associative Movement Italians Abroad and obtained a mere 0.2% of the vote. In January 2010 the LD formed an electoral pact with the Union of the Centre (UdC), successor of the UDC. In December the party was a founding member of the centrist New Pole for Italy along with the UdC, Future and Freedom, Alliance for Italy and the Movement for the Autonomies. However, a few months later the LD returned to support Berlusconi and Melchiorre briefly served as under-secretary of Economic Development in May 2011. In October 2012 the balance of accounts of the PdL showed that the LD had received one million of Euros of financial support from Berlusconi's party, which used to finance its satellites. In the 2013 general election the LD externally supported Mario Monti's Civic Choice and, after the election, Melchiorre returned to her job as magistratehttp://www.difesa.it/SGD- DNA/GiornaleUfficiale/dispense2014/Documents/20mar14/DM_30_05_2013_Riamm_in_ruolo_MELCHIORRE.pdf and, having consequently resigned from party president, she was replaced by Tanoni. In the 2016 constitutional referendum the party was part of the \\"yes\\" camp, that was soundly defeated, and organised a committee presided by Tiziano Treu, a former minister and senator for Italian Renewal and DL.http://liberal- democratici.it/bastaunsi-comitato-nazionale Leadership *President: Lamberto Dini (2007‚Äì2008), Daniela Melchiorre (2008‚Äì2013), Italo Tanoni (2013‚Äìpresent) **Vice President: Francesco Pifferi (2013‚Äìpresent) *Coordinator: Italo Tanoni (2007‚Äì2013), Alessandro Campagnioli (2013‚Äìpresent) ReferencesExternal links *Official website Category:Centrist parties in Italy Category:Liberal parties in Italy Category:Political parties established in 2007 Category:2007 establishments in Italy ","title":"Liberal Democrats (Italy)"},{"id":"13328975","text":"The Battle of Feyiase was the decisive battle in the struggle that led to the Ashanti Empire replacing Denkyira as the dominant power among the Twi-speaking Akan peoples.

Born in Tennessee, he migrated with his family to Illinois when he was in his early teens. His first political office was as county sheriff and he later served multiple terms in the Illinois House of Representatives. Dement held the federal Receiver of Public Moneys post with U.S. Government Land Office under five different presidential administrations. During the 1832 Black Hawk War, Dement commanded a battalion in combat at the Second Battle of Kellogg's Grove. Sauk war chief Black Hawk later commented on the valor displayed by Dement during the battle. Dement died in 1883 at his home in Dixon, Illinois. Early life John Dement was born in Gallatin, Sumner County, Tennessee on April 26, 1804. His parents, David and Dorcas Dement (n√©e Willis) moved to Illinois in 1817 and he moved with them; the family settled on a farm in Franklin County.Armstrong, Perry A. The Sauks and the Black Hawk War, pp. 630-634. Political career In 1826 Dement took his first political office when he was elected sheriff of Franklin County. He went on and served the same area in the Illinois House of Representatives from 1828 to 1830. The General Assembly elected Dement state Treasurer in 1831, and he was reelected twice, until he resigned the post to serve in the General Assembly once again in 1836, as state representative from Fayette County, where the county seat of Vandalia was about to lose its position as capital of Illinois. By 1837, Springfield had become the capital of Illinois, and Dement, unable to prevent the move, resigned his General Assembly seat and moved toward the northern mining region near Galena. The same year, Dement began his career in U.S. federal government when U.S. President Andrew Jackson appointed him Receiver of Public Moneys. Dement held the position through the administration of Martin Van Buren until, in 1841 succeeding President William Harrison removed him from the post. During the election of 1844 he served as district elector to the Electoral College from Illinois for James K. Polk and George M. Dallas.Lanman, Charles. Biographical Annals of the Civil Government of the United States: During Its First Century, (Google Books), J. Anglim: 1876, p. 528-529\\\\. Retrieved 18 September 2007. When Polk took office in 1845 he appointed Dement, once again, to the position of Receiver of Public Moneys. Zachary Taylor removed Dement from his position again in 1849, and Franklin Pierce reappointed Dement to the post in 1853. Dement continued to serve as Receiver of Public Moneys under U.S. President James Buchanan, until the position was abolished in 1861. In another capacity, Dement was elected delegate to every Illinois Constitutional Convention during his lifetime, except the first in 1818, when Dement was 14 years old. At the conventions in 1862 and 1870 he was elected and served as president pro tempore. Militia service This portrait of Dement was published in Frank Stevens' 1903 book The Black Hawk War. Dement's political career was put on hold by the start of the 1832 Black Hawk War, which pitted the Illinois and Michigan Territory Militias against Sauk Chief Black Hawk and his band of warriors. Dement served in three separate capacities during the conflict, during which, he held three different military ranks. As a colonel Dement served as aide-de-camp for Illinois Governor John Reynolds. Dement also served as a captain, and a major. As a major Dement commanded a battalion during the Second Battle of Kellogg's Grove.Lusk, David W. Politics and Politicians: A Succinct History of the Politics of Illinois (Google Books), H. W. Rokker: 1884, pp. 326-328\\\\. Retrieved 18 September 2007. As captain, Dement led a Fayette County company of volunteers, formed on April 20, from Beardstown to Oquawka and the brigade of General Samuel Whiteside. The company then moved north toward the mouth of the Rock River. At the river, the company was mustered into federal service under General Henry Atkinson and marched on to Dixon and then Ottawa where they were mustered out of service on May 28.Armstrong, Perry A. The Sauks and the Black Hawk War, pp. 430-435. After the company was mustered out of service Dement offered to stay on duty until the new army, called up May 15, could arrive in the field June 10. Governor Reynolds responded to Dement's offer by appointing him to his staff and promoting him to the rank of colonel. The second army arrived on the Illinois frontier on June 19, 1832. On June 16, 1832, Dement reenlisted in the Illinois Militia as a private. A spy battalion was formed on June 17 within the First Brigade of the Illinois Militia under the command of General Alexander Posey, and Dement was elected battalion commander. Governor Reynolds promoted him to major, and Dement took command of the battalion. Dement's command, 170 strong, set out for Kellogg's Grove on June 25 under orders from General Zachary Taylor. Dement's actions at the Second Battle of Kellogg's Grove later earned him praise from his adversary, Black Hawk. Black Hawk stated of Dement in his autobiography: During the battle, Dement's battalion lost five men with another three were wounded, many horses were killed as well. That night American reinforcements arrived under the command of General Posey, who chose not to pursue the attackers and instead reported the situation to Taylor.Autobiography of Ma-Ka-Tai-Me-She-Kia-Kiak, \\"Major Dement's Battle with the Indians .\\" Retrieved 18 September 2007. Black Hawk asserted later that had Posey chose to attack him and his warriors that the blow dealt Black Hawk's band would have been decisive and war-ending. In fact, Dement's opinion was that there were more Native Americans at Kellogg's Grove than at any other engagement during the war. Dement's command served on active duty from its inception until the end of hostilities at the Battle of Bad Axe. The battalion was mustered out of service on August 7, 1832, which ended John Dement's military career. Dement Town In 1849, while holding the Government Land Office receiver post, Dement settled in Dixon, Illinois. Dement erected a residence and stone store and later Judge John D. Crabtree settled in the area. Near the center of the area settled by Dement was a well known area called Sandhill Grove. Sandhill Grove contained sandy soil, a large oak stand, and during certain seasons large flocks of cranes.\\"Dement Town,\\" Lee County Historical Society, Stories & Articles, 31 May 2004. Retrieved 18 September 2007. Dement helped to persuade the Illinois Central Railroad to locate its Dixon depot near the western edge of town when the railroad line was constructed in the early 1850s. The depot location was contrary to where most at the time thought it would be located, near the town's central business district. The depot's construction dramatically increased Dement's property value and much of his land was surveyed into town lots and sold off. The area, which was visibly separated from the rest of Dixon by the rail embankment and vacant lots, became known as Dement Town. The area prospered until Dement's death, when it began to decline. However, the section of Dixon known as Dement Town still exists. Late life and death John Dement married Mary Lousie Dodge, daughter of Black Hawk War commander Henry Dodge, in 1835 at Fort Leavenworth. The couple had three children, a son, Henry Dodge Dement, who went on to serve as Illinois Secretary of State, and two daughters.Reynolds, John.

In database systems and transaction processing (transaction management) distributed concurrency control refers primarily to the concurrency control of a distributed database. It also refers to the concurrency control in a multidatabase (and other multi-transactional object) environment (e.g., federated database, grid computing, and cloud computing environments. A major goal for distributed concurrency control is distributed serializability (or global serializability for multidatabase systems). Distributed concurrency control poses special challenges beyond centralized one, primarily due to communication and computer latency. It often requires special techniques, like distributed lock manager over fast computer networks with low latency, like switched fabric (e.g., InfiniBand). Commitment ordering (or commit ordering) is a general serializability technique that achieves distributed serializability (and global serializability in particular) effectively on a large scale, without concurrency control information distribution (e.g., local precedence relations, locks, timestamps, or tickets), and thus without performance penalties that are typical to other serializability techniques (Raz 1992). The most common distributed concurrency control technique is strong strict two-phase locking (SS2PL, also named rigorousness), which is also a common centralized concurrency control technique. SS2PL provides both the serializability, strictness, and commitment ordering properties. Strictness, a special case of recoverability, is utilized for effective recovery from failure, and commitment ordering allows participating in a general solution for global serializability. For large-scale distribution and complex transactions, distributed locking's typical heavy performance penalty (due to delays, latency) can be saved by using the atomic commitment protocol, which is needed in a distributed database for (distributed) transactions' atomicity (e.g., two-phase commit, or a simpler one in a reliable system), together with some local commitment ordering variant (e.g., local SS2PL) instead of distributed locking, to achieve global serializability in the entire system. All the commitment ordering theoretical results are applicable whenever atomic commitment is utilized over partitioned, distributed recoverable (transactional) data, including automatic distributed deadlock resolution. Such technique can be utilized also for a large-scale parallel database, where a single large database, residing on many nodes and using a distributed lock manager, is replaced with a (homogeneous) multidatabase, comprising many relatively small databases (loosely defined; any process that supports transactions over partitioned data and participates in atomic commitment complies), fitting each into a single node, and using commitment ordering (e.g., SS2PL, strict CO) together with some appropriate atomic commitment protocol (without using a distributed lock manager).

The PSCAI worked closely with the Iraqi Government, Coalition Provisional Authority and Coalition forces to promote transparency, legitimacy, and accountability for the private security company industry. The PSCAI was dissolved on December 31, 2011. Details Consisting of over 40 member companies, the PSCAI was the only active trade group in Iraq focusing on issues related to the private security company (PSC) industry. The PSCAI served a liaison between the Multi-National Force ‚Äì Iraq (MNF-I), the Government of Iraq (GoI), the Coalition Governments and its member companies. While primarily an operationally focused organization, the PSCAI advocated on behalf of the industry internationally. In addition to representing its members in meetings with senior leaders of the United States Government, Coalition Governments and the Government of Iraq to include the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG), the association disseminated information critical to operations in Iraq to all members. The PSCAI held monthly Plenary Meetings, or when required. Typically, these meetings were attended by member companies operating in Iraq, as well as by representatives of the Iraq Ministry of Interior (MoI)1, US Embassy Regional Security Office (RSO), Joint Area Support Group Central (JASG-C), Multi-National Force Iraq (MNFI), Multi-National Corps ‚Äì Iraq (MNCI), the MNCI Contractor Operations Center (CONOC), the MNFI Contractor Procedures Oversight Division (CPOD), USAF International Zone Police, Project & Contracting Office (PCO) Logistics, Logistics Movement Control Center (LMCC), and the Joint Contracting Command Iraq and Afghanistan (JCC-IA).\\"[2] A small core staff including an appointed Director and Deputy Director lead the association. The remaining leadership of the association is a seven-member Board of Directors serving six-month terms. The Board is elected from representatives of member companies and is responsible for setting overall policy and objectives for the association. For some time, the association was involved in efforts to enforce standard rules and regulations as guidelines for conducting private security operations in Iraq. Additionally, the association was working with the Government in all of Iraq to ensure fair, consistent, and transparent licensing and registration procedures and operational matters including weapons cards and registration, vehicle registration, incident resolution, etc. The PSCAI was a strong advocate for accountability in the private security company industry and according to its charter, \\"Will insist upon behaviors consistent with norms and conventions of the international community.\\" The association charter further states, \\"the PSCAI maintains an active interest in the conduct and behavior of all PSCs and fundamentally recognizes that its Members must operate within the Law of Iraq.\\" Related to transparency for the private security company industry, the PSCAI works to establish and maintain a network with Members, the Iraqi and relevant Governments, Coalition, PSC clients, media and other stakeholders that allow discussion and resolution of security related issues with transparency, accountability, mutual understanding and trust.\\" The PSCAI maintains an active interest in the conduct and behavior of all PSCs and fundamentally recognizes that its Members must operate within the Law of Iraq and endeavors to engender good will and foster good relationships within the Iraqi community by the promotion of acceptable practices based on the fundamental respect for the rights and dignity for the Iraqi people. Furthermore, PSCAI members are required to comply with Rules for the Use of Force (RUF) as defined within the Laws of Iraq, Laws of Armed conflict and contractual terms, ensuring all personnel are trained in these regulations.  History  With the dissolution of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) in June 2004, the office within the CPA (the Private Security Company Working Group) that was responsible for all matters relating to private security companies was also dissolved. The leadership of several private security companies realized that although the office had gone away, the need for a centralized point for all matters relating to private security companies still existed. As a result, on industry initiative, the PSCAI was officially formed in August 2004. The very first company to join was an Iraqi company, the Falcon Group. The Director of the Association serves as the principal liaison between the USG, GoI and member companies. In March 2007 a Deputy Director was added. In December 2011, the organization disbanded.

Both diesel locomotives and the first two coaches plunged into Newark Bay and sank immediately, killing 48 people and injuring the same number.The Coast Guard helped with rescuing 43 survivors and recovering 29 bodies according to A third coach, snagged by its rear truck (bogie), hung precariously off the bridge for two hours before it also toppled into the water. As the locomotive crew was killed, the cause of the accident was never determined nor reinvestigated.  Conditions  There were three signals spaced at three-quarters of a mile, a quarter of a mile, and from the lift bridge, and an automatic derailing device fifty feet beyond the third signal. The bridge span had to be down and locked electrically before the signals and derail devices could be cleared for movement on the track. Conversely, all the devices had to be in their most restrictive positions before the bridge could be unlocked and raised. The train ran through two signals and immediately derailed; the automatic derailer was designed to knock the wheels off the track so that the resistance of the ties and ballast against the train's wheels would bring a slow-moving derailed train to a stop. Train #3314, although derailed, was moving at such a great speed that it did not have sufficient distance to stop before diving off the bridge.  Causes  The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), the New Jersey Public Utilities Commission, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers each conducted separate inquiries into the wreck, and all three found that the absence of a \\"dead man's control\\" was one primary cause of the accident. After the inquiries, the New Jersey Public Utilities Commission ordered the railroads to install such devices on all passenger locomotives operating in New Jersey. Some CNJ locomotives were equipped already with such devices, but this did not include the engine leading Train #3314 (a EMD GP7 No. 1532) on the day of the wreck. The CNJ claimed that such a device was not always necessary, because all their trains had two crewmen in the locomotive cab. If the engineer was incapacitated somehow, the fireman would assume control of the locomotive. An autopsy found that the engineer, 63-year-old Lloyd Wilburn, had indications of hypertensive heart disease, but that he had died of asphyxia due to drowning. However, no reason could be found to explain why fireman Peter Andrew, 42, could not or did not stop the train. Investigators raised the wreckage and did not find any defect of the braking system on the locomotives and coaches; it was also determined that the signal system and derailing device on the bridge had functioned properly. Lacking more definitive evidence, it was presumed that the engineer had somehow become incapacitated in the cab and the fireman failed to take appropriate action to stop the train. The presence of a dead man's control in the locomotive cab might have averted the catastrophe, and, while the ICC only \\"recommended\\" the installation of these devices, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities directed that the railroad install them in all of its locomotives.  Aftermath  At least 48 people died in the wreck, including former New York Yankees second baseman George \\"Snuffy\\" Stirnweiss and James Carmalt Adams, the brother-in-law of author Kurt Vonnegut.New York Times articles about Snuffy Stirnweiss's death, reproduced at The Dead Ball Era website. Retrieved on October 13, 2013. The CNJ faced a number of legal actions which were all settled out of court. The two locomotives, #1532 and #1526, were raised, rebuilt by the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors (EMD) and returned to service. Locomotive #1532 retained its original number, while the #1526 was renumbered #1531. They served primarily as freight locomotives, although #1532 was photographed in passenger service after its return from EMD.

She appeared in 350 films between 1908 and 1945. Early years Claire MacDowell was born in New York City on November 2, 1877, the daughter of Eugene A. MacDowell and Fanny Reeves.Silent Film Necrology, p.334 c.2001 by Eugene M. Vazzana Her aunt, actress Fanny Davenport, gave her early training in acting. Fanny Davenport's second husband was Eugene's brother Melbourne MacDowell. Career When she was 17, she was an understudy in a theatrical company headed by Charles Frohman. Still something of a youthful beauty, McDowell appeared in numerous short, early feature films. She graduated to playing character and mother types. She appeared in Douglas Fairbanks' The Mark of Zorro (1920). McDowell costarred in two of the biggest films of the silent era, The Big Parade and Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ, in which she played mothers both times. McDowell's Broadway credits included Herod (1909), To Have and to Hold (1901), and Hearts Are Trumps (1900). When she was 38, McDowell retired, but later she returned to acting, particular portraying mothers. Personal life and death She was married to silent screen character actor Charles Hill Mailes from 1906 until his death in 1937. The couple appeared in numerous silent films together, including The Mark of Zorro. They had two sons, Robert and Eugene. She died in Hollywood, California on October 23, 1966.

He was born in the village Khashmi in Kakheti, eastern Georgia (then under the Imperial Russian rule). Educated at the theological academies of Tbilisi and Moscow, Bakradze worked as a teacher at Gori and a governmental clerk at Kutaisi in the 1850s. At the same time, he regularly wrote articles on Georgia's history and ethnography for Georgian and Russian press. In 1861, Bakradze permanently settled in Tbilisi where he energetically engaged in public and scholarly activities. In 1875, he published his resonant work The Caucasus in Ancient Monuments of Christianity (). In 1878, Bakradze was the first scholar to have travelled and studied Adjara and Tao-Klarjeti, the historical Georgian lands recently recovered from the Ottoman Empire. His accounts of this research appeared in several publications and, in 1879, he was elected a corresponding member of Imperial Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg. He helped found the Society for the Spreading of Literacy Among Georgians (1879), Society of Amateurs of Caucasian Archaeology (1873), the Society for Caucasian History and Archaeology (1881; chaired it until 1886) and the Museum of Church Antiquities at the Tbilisi Sioni Cathedral (1889). His last major work, The History of Georgia (Georgian: ·Éò·É°·É¢·Éù·É†·Éò·Éê ·É°·Éê·É•·Éê·É†·Éó·Éï·Éî·Éö·Éù·É°·Éò), appeared in 1889 and was an insightful study into the history of Georgia from the beginnings to the end of the 10th century. Bakradze died in Tbilisi in 1890. His son, Zakaria Bakradze, was a general in the Georgian and Polish armies.

The practice relies on the expectation on the part of the audience of something humorous, and when this does not happen, the irony itself is of comedic value. Anti-humor is also the basis of various types of pranks and hoaxes. The humor of such jokes is based on the surprise factor of absence of an expected joke or of a punch line in a narration which is set up as a joke. This kind of anticlimax is similar to that of the shaggy dog story.Warren A. Shibles, Humor Reference Guide: A Comprehensive Classification and Analysis (Hardcover) 1998 In fact, some researchers see the \\"shaggy dog story\\" as a type of anti-joke.John Henderson, \\"Writing Down Rome: Satire, Comedy, and Other Offences in Latin Poetry\\" (1999) , p. 218 Examples The shaggy dog story involves telling an extremely long joke with an intricate (and sometimes grisly) back story and surreal or repetitive plotline, before ending the story with either a weak spoonerism, or abruptly stopping with no real punchline at all. Another type of anti-joke gives a suggestion of building to a (typically risqu√©) punchline, but breaks the audience's anticipation by swerving to a non-risqu√© punchline or no punchline at all: \\"Did you hear about the honeymooners who confused the tube of K-Y Jelly with window putty? Quite the tragedy, all the windows fell out of their new home.\\" One more type of anti-humor is found in the joke \\"No soap radio\\". The joke is meant to have no punch line. When someone tells the joke, it is most likely with their friends, and it is meant to confuse others who do not know that there is not supposed to be a joke. In stand-up comedy Alternative comedy, among its other aspects, parodies the traditional idea of the joke as a form of humor.Andrew Stott (2005) \\"Comedy\\", , p. 119 Anti-humor jokes are also often associated with deliberately bad stand-up comedians. Stand-up comedian Andy Kaufman, had his own unique brand of anti-humor, quasi-surrealist acts coupled with performance art; one of his best-known manifestations of this was his act as the fictional persona of Tony Clifton, an untalented lounge lizard entertainer. Norm Macdonald is another comedian sometimes associated with performing anti-humor, although he has objected to the characterization.

The Top Ten Club was opened on 31 October 1960 by Peter Eckhorn and his manager Horst Fascher. After disagreements, Peter Eckhorn separated from Horst Fascher shortly afterwards. Fascher then worked as a waiter in a restaurant in the Gro√üe Freiheit, where he persuaded Manfred Weissleder to turn the former Stern cinema into a music club, the Star-Club, becoming his manager.  The Beatles at \\"The Top Ten Club\\"  The Top Ten Club's former entrance on Reeperbahn (2011) The Beatles, who, until 31 December 1960, were under contract with Bruno Koschmider, the owner of Kaiserkeller, often visited Top Ten Club, where Tony Sheridan performed with his Jets. They also played together occasionally, which Bruno Koschmider found out about. On November 21, 1960 George Harrison was deported to England by the police, because at the age of 17 he was too young to work in a nightclub after midnight. It is assumed that it was Bruno Koschmider who tipped off the police because he was annoyed that the Beatles were unfaithful to him and wanted to switch to the Top Ten Club. So, Harrison had to go back to Liverpool.(The Beatles Anthology) DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:49:56) Notice telling Harrison to leave Hamburg. On November 29, Paul McCartney and Pete Best were arrested for attempted arson. They were said to have set fire to a condom when they packed their personal belongings in Bruno Koschmider's Bambi cinema, were they slept, to bring them to the Top Ten Club. Best and McCartney spent three hours in the Davidwache Police Station, and were deported on 1 December 1960. Lennon on 10 December and Sutcliffe in February 1961, also returned to Liverpool.

Known as Chesapeake Beach Road, the highway runs from MD 4 at Lyons Creek east to MD 261 in Chesapeake Beach. MD 260 connects the twin towns of Chesapeake Beach and North Beach in northern Calvert County with highways to Upper Marlboro, Washington, Annapolis, and Baltimore. Much of the highway follows part of the course of the former Chesapeake Beach Railway, which ended service in the mid-1930s. MD 260 was constructed in the early 1920s from MD 2 south of Owings east to Chesapeake Beach. The highway was extended west to what is now MD 4 south of Dunkirk in the early 1930s. MD 260 was relocated to a road built on the railroad right-of-way from Lyons Creek through Owings in the mid-1950s. Route description View east along MD 260 in Owings MD 260 begins at a trumpet interchange with MD 4 (Southern Maryland Boulevard) at Lyons Creek, which forms part of the Calvert-Anne Arundel county border. There is no access from westbound MD 260 to southbound MD 4; that movement is made by following northbound MD 4 into Anne Arundel County and making a U-turn at the Lower Pindell Road intersection. MD 260 heads southeast as a two-lane undivided road on a straight path for almost . The highway crosses a pair of tributaries of Hall Creek and passes by the historic home Maidstone and passes through the southwestern corner of Anne Arundel County. Immediately after re-entering Calvert County, MD 260 temporarily expands to four lanes for its intersection with MD 2 (Solomons Island Road). The highway continues through Owings, where the highway intersects MD 778 (Old Solomons Island Road). Southeast of Owings, MD 260 crosses Hall Creek. MD 260's heading shifts from southeast to east where it meets Mount Harmony Road at a trumpet interchange in the hamlet of Paris. A few houses and small businesses are situated within this interchange. Mount Harmony Road, which has a bridge over eastbound MD 260 and the ramp from Mount Harmony Road to westbound MD 260, is unsigned MD 260D within the interchange. East of the interchange at Lafayette Drive, the state highway becomes a four-lane divided highway, and the median becomes wide and forested just east of the Boyds Turn Road-Horace Ward Road intersection. The median narrows as MD 260 enters the town of Chesapeake Beach and ends as the highway transitions to a two-lane road with a center left-turn lane at G Street. The highway continues four blocks to its eastern terminus at MD 261 (Bayside Road) just west of the Chesapeake Bay shoreline and several blocks north of Fishing Creek and the Chesapeake Beach Railway Station. The section of the median between the Harrison Boulevard-Limerick Lane intersection and the G Street-Cox Road intersection is decorated with many Christmas light displays by the Town of Chesapeake Beach during the holiday season. History The Chesapeake Beach Railway was constructed from Washington southeast through Upper Marlboro to the newly constructed resort town of Chesapeake Beach between 1897 and 1900. The railroad followed the path of modern MD 260 from Lyons Creek to Mount Harmony Road on the way to its eastern terminus at the Chesapeake Beach Railway Station on the south side of the mouth of Fishing Creek. The first improved road connection to the resort was built as a gravel road. The road was completed from MD 2 (now MD 765I) at Mount Harmony to about west of the beach by 1921. Chesapeake Beach Road was completed to the beach by 1923. Construction on a graveled westward extension of MD 260 to Southern Maryland Boulevard, which was then MD 416, south of Dunkirk was started in 1930 and completed by 1933. The first major upgrade of MD 260 occurred in 1934 when the highway was relocated to a straighter path, bypassing what is now Horace Ward Road, and paved and widened to from the west end of the relocation at Boyds Turn Road to MD 261 in Chesapeake Beach. The highway's original one-lane timber bridge over the Chesapeake Beach Railway at Paris was replaced with a wider concrete bridge between 1934 and 1936. This bridge was built contemporaneously with the end of passenger service on the Chesapeake Beach Railway in 1935. The remainder of MD 260 from MD 416 to Paris was proposed to be expanded from in width from MD 416 to Paris as early as 1934 and again in 1940. The first road to be built along the abandoned Chesapeake Beach Railway was a county highway constructed by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1946 from Owings to MD 260 at Paris that included a timber bridge over Hall Creek. This segment of highway was reconstructed as a wide road surfaced with bituminous stabilized gravel in 1951. Work on the remainder of the highway from Lyons Creek to Owings began in 1952 and the new bituminous stabilized gravel highway was completed in 1954. The new highway was repaved with bituminous concrete in 1956. The new Chesapeake Beach Road was designated MD 751 by 1955 but was changed to a rerouting of MD 260 to its present course in 1956, at which time Mount Harmony Road was removed from the state highway system. MD 260 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from Mount Harmony Road east to G Street in Chesapeake Beach in 1960. As part of this project, the highway was relocated from what is now Cox Road on the edge of Chesapeake Beach. MD 260's intersection at MD 4 was replaced with an interchange in 2002 and 2003. Junction listAuxiliary routes MD 260 has one existing auxiliary route and three former auxiliary routes. *MD 260A was the designation for the one-lane ramp from what is now the western terminus of MD 260 to a merge with northbound MD 4 just south of Lyons Creek. MD 260A was officially changed to a ramp designation in 2003 after the MD 4-MD 260 interchange was completed. *MD 260B was the designation for the connecting roadway running west from MD 260 to MD 4 that allowed access from westbound MD 260 to southbound MD 4. This roadway was removed as part of the construction of the overpass carrying southbound MD 4 traffic to MD 260 in 2002. *MD 260C was the designation for the ramp from northbound MD 4 to MD 260 just south of MD 260B.

View through a window in the Manor of the gardens. Holywell Manor is a historic building in central Oxford, England, in the parish of Holywell. It currently houses some of Balliol College's postgraduate student population. It is on the corner of Manor Road and St Cross Road, next to St Cross Church, which has become the Balliol College Historic Collections Centre. History The Manor in the snow. The manor was held by the rectors of the Church of St Peter-in-the-East in the 11th and 12th centuries. It passed to Merton College in 1294 and was rebuilt by the College in 1516. It was leased to Edward Napper by the College in 1531. When occupied by Napper's family, the house became a refuge for Roman Catholic priests. The building was enlarged during 1555‚Äì72 and Napper's family remained in residence until the 17th Century. The building was partially demolished in 1761 and divided into three parts in 1828. Balliol College has had a presence in the area since the purchase by Benjamin Jowett, the Master, in the 1870s of the open area which is the Balliol sports ground 'The Master's Field'. On the edges of this, along Mansfield Road and St Cross Road, have been built Fellows houses, notably 'The King's Mound' in 1894. The oldest surviving part of the site is the 16th century farmhouse which now houses the 'Praefectus', i.e., the resident supervising Fellow. It was acquired by Balliol College in 1929, prior to which it had been a convent of the community of St. John the Baptist, Clewer and a home for unmarried mothers (though it was deserted by 1929). The purchase was planned by Kenneth Norman Bell in order to provide accommodation for undergraduates and was funded by donations to the Balliol Society which he had founded expressly for this purpose. The extensive extensions to the original manor were designed by the architect George Kennedy an Old Boy of the College. These include the road facing fa√ßade, the entrance courtyard and the grand Queen Anne style wings surrounding the distinctive two rows of Ginkgo trees planted by C. S. Orwin. The Manor opened in 1932 and remained a hostel for Balliol's undergraduates until the 1960s, except for during World War II, when it was lent to St Hugh's College. It then became a mixed graduate community shared with St Anne's College's female graduates. Finally in 1984, after Balliol College had begun accepting women it took its current form as a residence just for Balliol's graduates. A supplementary graduate students accommodation block, built on the opposite corner of the road to the Manor on the 'Master's Field', was opened in 1966 and is officially the 'Martin Building' after Leslie Martin, and known jocularly as 'Holywell Minor'. In 1986 another block next to this was opened as the 'Dellal Building', named after Balliol Foundation fellow Jack Dellal. Between 2000 and 2008 a group of undergraduate resident Staircases have been developed along Jowett Walk. In 2019 the Dellal and Martin buildings were demolished to make way for new Balliol accommodation buildings that extend along Jowett Walk and St Cross Road, opposite Holywell Manor. The building was significantly extended in 1993 with the construction of the James Fairfax Yard block off the manor's north wing. A review of college services led to the decision to close the kitchens and dining room, Manor residents were to use the new facilities at the College Hall, from 2008. This reversed a tendency towards the Manor being regarded as a separate college; Balliol is in fact the ninth largest graduate college in the University by post-graduate student members. This allowed for internal improvements and facilities, notably an additional common space known as the 'cockpit' or 'lounge', and a gym, which are available for use by all College members. Art Kenneth Norman Bell began an association between Holywell and the arts which still continues. What is now one of the Manor's computer rooms is decorated with murals depicting the tradition of the founding of the College painted by Gilbert Spencer, the brother of Stanley Spencer. In addition, the garden contains a fountain by Peter Lyon and a wind sculpture by George Rickey. Famous residents * Crown Princess Masako of Japan stayed in Holywell Manor.

It is the fifth law school in the UC system. In September 2007, Erwin Chemerinsky was named as the law school's first dean. Chemerinsky was hired to be dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law in 2017; L. Song Richardson became interim dean in July 2017 and full dean in January 2018. Currently ranked #27 in the US News rankings, it is the youngest school ever in the USNWR top 25. History Initially, it was announced that the school would be named for Donald Bren, chairman of the Irvine Company, due to his $20 million donation towards its founding. In 2008, an agreement was reached between Bren and UCI that the school would not bear his name, in order to be consistent with other UC schools and the trend away from naming law schools after major donors. In the summer of 2011, the American Bar Association granted the school provisional accreditation. As law schools need to exist for two years before being granted provisional accreditation, this was the earliest point at which the school could become accredited. The school was granted full accreditation in June 2014. Chemerinsky hiring controversy In hiring an inaugural dean, the University approached Duke University school of law Professor Erwin Chemerinsky. After signing a contract with Chemerinsky on September 4, 2007, the offer was rescinded by then UCI Chancellor Michael V. Drake because he felt the law professor's commentaries were \\"polarizing\\" and would not serve the interests of California's first new public law school in 40 years; Drake claimed the decision was his own and not the subject of any outside influence.Garrett Therolf and Henry Weinstein, UC Irvine aborts hiring Chemerinsky as law school dean , Los Angeles Times, September 13, 2007. The action was criticized by liberal and conservative scholars who felt it hindered the academic mission of the law school, and disbelief over Chancellor Drake's claims that it was the subject of no outside influence. The issue was the subject of a New York Times editorial on Friday, September 14, 2007. Details emerged revealing that UCI had received criticism on the hire from California Chief Justice Ronald M. George, who criticized Chemerinsky's grasp of death penalty appeals, as well as a group of prominent Orange County Republicans and Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, who wanted to derail the appointment.Garrett Therolf, Chemerinsky returns to UC Irvine post, Los Angeles Times, September 17, 2007. Drake traveled over a weekend to Durham, North Carolina, and the two reached an agreement late Sunday evening. On September 17, Chemerinsky issued a joint press release with Drake indicating that Chemerinsky would head the UCI law school, stating \\"Our new law school will be founded on the bedrock principle of academic freedom. The chancellor reiterated his lifelong, unqualified commitment to academic freedom, which extends to every faculty member, including deans and other senior administrators.\\"OC Blog: Statement From Chemerinsky & Drake Faculty In 2010, University of Chicago Law professor Brian Leiter, in his \\"Leiter Law School Rankings\\", ranked the UC Irvine faculty 9th in the nation in terms of scholarly impact.Leiter Rankings, scholarly impact In 2012, Professor Gregory Sisk and his colleagues in the library of St. Thomas Law School in Minnesota prepared a new scholarly impact study, using the same methodology as Leiter's 2010 study and with Leiter consulting. The 2012 study calculated scholarly impact in terms of citations by full-time teaching faculty over the period from 2007 through 2011, and ranked the UC Irvine Law School faculty as 7th, up two places from the 2010 ranking.ABA Journal, Study Names Top Law Schools for Scholarly Impact In September 2015, Sisk updated the rankings to include data from 2010-2014. Based on this new data, UC Irvine was ranked 6th in the nation. UC Irvine's student-faculty ratio is 7.3 to 1, making it one of the lowest ratios among law schools in the country. Rankings and scholarships To help attract \\"high-quality\\" students, the school raised funds for full scholarships for all members of its inaugural class. Over 2,700 applications were received to join the inaugural class, 4% were accepted. Classes officially began on August 24, 2009. The school's inaugural class was composed of 34 women and 26 men, with a median LSAT of 167 and median undergraduate GPA of 3.61. UC Irvine's initial LSAT and GPA statistics rival Southern California's other top law schools, UCLA and USC, which are both ranked among the nation's top 20 by US News & World Report. Despite offering reduced scholarships to its next two classes (one-half for 2013, and one-third for 2014) and application pools dropping to less than one thousand per year, GPA and LSAT numbers for these classes remained largely the same. The school announced that while need-based financial aid would be available to the Class of 2015, a universal scholarship for every student would not be offered. However, the school set aside funds for 20 full scholarships for this class including some scholarships specifically for students who wish to pursue public interest law. UCI Law School received its first US News & World Report ranking in March 2015, when it was ranked #30 in the nation. By then, the median LSAT was 164 and the median undergraduate GPA was 3.53. The publication also ranked UC Irvine 11th for its clinical program, 23rd for its intellectual property law program, and in the top 10 for the student diversity index. In March 2016, US News and World Report ranked UC Irvine 28th among 144 law schools, up two places from the previous year. It was also ranked #13 in clinical training, #23 in legal writing, #25 in intellectual property, and in the top 12 for the student diversity index. In 2016, The National Jurist ranked UC Irvine #4 in its \\"Best Schools for Practical Training\\" rankings. In March 2018, US News and World Report ranked UC Irvine 21st among 146 law schools, up seven places from the previous year. Federal clerkships In December 2011, the percentage of the Class of 2012 students who had received Federal District Court or Circuit Court judge clerkships for the year following graduation was near the highest in the country, placing only lower than Yale, and placing ahead of Harvard Law. In May 2015, the ABA released the newest edition of law school employment data. Based on these new findings, UCI was ranked third in the placement of federal clerkships, behind only Yale and Stanford. Employment According to UC Irvine's official 2015 ABA-required disclosures, 85.45% of the Class of 2015 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation. UC Irvine's Law School Transparency under-employment score is 11.82%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2015 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation. Tuition Tuition for 2011-12 cost approximately $40,000 for California residents and $52,000 for non-residents. For the first, second, and third entering classes, tuition was paid for by private scholarships from Mark P. Robinson, Jr., and others at 100%, 50%, and 33% respectively. The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at the University of California-Irvine School of Law for the 2013-2014 academic year is $69,484 for California residents and $75,978 for non-residents. The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $278,566.

Laid down as M14, she was named after the French general of the Napoleonic Wars Marshal Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult. She served in both World Wars and was decommissioned in 1946. Design Designed for inshore operations along the sandbank strewn Belgian coastline, Marshal Soult was equipped with two battleship guns. Originally, these guns were to have been stripped from one of the battlecruisers and after they were redesigned. However the guns were not ready, and guns intended for the battleship were used instead. The diesel engines used by the ships were a constant source of technical difficulty, restricting their use. Service Marshal Soult performed numerous bombardment operations against German positions in Flanders, including during the First Ostend Raid in April 1918. In October 1918, she became a tender to the gunnery school HMS Excellent at Portsmouth and in March 1919 undertook a similar role at Devonport before paying off in March 1921. Recommissioned in 1924, she moved to Chatham in April 1926 as a training ship. Her armament was removed in March 1940 and was later fitted to the new monitor , which was completed in 1941. In the year of her launch 1915, Caretta, an Admiralty Pinnace was assigned to her. Fate She served throughout the Second World War as a depot ship for trawlers at Portsmouth until being sold on 10 July 1946 and scrapped at Troon.  See also  * Commander R.D.

It is within the townland of Tinriland (historically Tinrilan), in the parish of Tullowmagimma. History Evidence of settlement in the Neolithic Period (3700-3400 BC) was found at the ancient burial site in Linkardstown in 1943. The find consisted of a polygonal stone chamber paved with stones that sloped upwards and inwards. Inside was found the remains of a single human, along with some pottery. Linkardstown Church and Graveyard is now in ruins, but the old stone baptismal font used in the church and which dates from the 18th century now stands in the grounds of the modern St. Joseph's Church, Tinryland. Ballyloo Castle, only a fragment of which remains, was home to the Kavanagh family and was built by Art √ìg Kavanagh of Pulmonty, King of Leinster who died in 1417. This castle was the centre for the Kavanagh's of Ballyloo until the arrival of Oliver Cromwell 200 years later.

W. Griffith, starring Blanche Sweet and written by Mack Sennett for the Biograph Company. The plot of the film involves a girl who takes over a telegraph station after her father takes ill. After the payroll for the town's mine is delivered, two drifters try to steal the money. Their robbery is foiled because the girl is able to telegraph for help and then hold the would-be robbers off until help arrives. The Lonedale Operator includes \\"elements of romance, drama, suspense, Western, and even a bit of comedy near the end.\\" Unlike most films at the time which had a simple plot line set in one location, The Lonedale Operator \\"intercuts three primary spaces‚Äîthe telegraph office interior, the criminals outside, and the rescue train.\\" Although audiences in 1911 were not used to such editing, the use of the telegraph helped them understand the crosscutting between scenes in such a way that they could follow the plot. The film is also significant for Griffith's use of a close-up of a wrench, which the girl had pretended was a gun. At the time of the film's release, close-ups were still uncommon. The Lonedale Operator illustrates Griffith's growing mastery of the medium. A print of the film survives in the film archive of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

Inspired by the organizational structure used in traditional shopping mall directories, online shopping directories organize ecommerce sites by their category and subcategory of goods sold. Without the constraints related to shopping at a physical mall (e.g. distance, location, hours of operation, access to transportation), an online shopping directory serves to aggregate all ecommerce sites in one centralized location in order to help a user decide where to shop online. Variations A shopping directory is different from a comparison shopping website (which is also referred to as a comparison shopping engine or a price comparison shopping site). While comparison shopping websites present product listings, by category, so a user can compare pricing on same and/or similar products, a shopping directory does not provide product comparison, review or sale. Examples of comparison shopping websites include: Google Shopping, Shopping.com, Shopzilla, TheFind.com A shopping directory is different from an online marketplace. Marketplaces sell products and/or services that are aggregated from various ecommerce sellers but sold under the branding and infrastructure of the named marketplace itself. Examples of online marketplaces include: Amazon, Etsy and eBay. A specialized form of a shopping directory is a coupon, daily deal and/or promotional savings site. Coupon sites provide a niche web directory centered on deal aggregation by listing only ecommerce sites that offer additional savings to the user. Coupon sites are very popular with users but often are viewed negatively by merchants.David Streitfeld (Oct 2011), , NYTimes, retrieved on 8 April 2014 Examples of coupon sites include: Retailmenot, Coupons.com, Groupon History Free directories such as the Open Directory Project, often updated by volunteers, lost their prominence and relevancy in today's search-driven internet. Before the increased popularity of the Google search engine, shopping directories, such as that found at the Yahoo! Directory or the PayPal Shopping Directory, played a prominent role in users' online shopping habits and behavior. As Google gained dominance, users adapted their shopping search behavior to the new system. Most search engines took over the role traditionally filled by shopping directories. Recently, criticisms have emerged over the limits of using search engines such as Google and Bing for use in the ecommerce cycle. The dominance of the SEO structure in search makes competition fierce among merchants as they struggle for positioning on the Google search results pages. New methodologies for shopping directories are emerging as startups look to bridge the gap between ecommerce and search . As ecommerce continues to grow, startup companies are reinvisioning the shopping directory to make it more relevant to the growing needs of online shoppers. Business model * Charging a one-time and/or recurring listing fee to the ecommerce site * Use of affiliate programs of the listed ecommerce sites to earn commissions on referrals * Advertising in the directory itself, such as banner ads, contextual ads like Google AdSense or some form of sponsored listings (usually pay per click based) * Combination of above References Category:Web directories Category:E-commerce ","title":"Shopping directory"},{"id":"13329710","text":"Mark Bischof (born 1958, Duisburg) is a Dutch artist specializing in kinetic installations.

A semialgebraic function is a function with semialgebraic graph. Such sets and functions are mainly studied in real algebraic geometry which is the appropriate framework for algebraic geometry over the real numbers. Properties Similarly to algebraic subvarieties, finite unions and intersections of semialgebraic sets are still semialgebraic sets. Furthermore, unlike subvarieties, the complement of a semialgebraic set is again semialgebraic. Finally, and most importantly, the Tarski‚ÄìSeidenberg theorem says that they are also closed under the projection operation: in other words a semialgebraic set projected onto a linear subspace yields another such (as case of elimination of quantifiers). These properties together mean that semialgebraic sets form an o-minimal structure on R. A semialgebraic set (or function) is said to be defined over a subring A of R if there is some description as in the definition, where the polynomials can be chosen to have coefficients in A. On a dense open subset of the semialgebraic set S, it is (locally) a submanifold. One can define the dimension of S to be the largest dimension at points at which it is a submanifold. It is not hard to see that a semialgebraic set lies inside an algebraic subvariety of the same dimension.

Biography Bagley was born in Salt Lake City and raised in Oceanside, California, where his father was mayor and his mother was a school teacher. Always interested in politics, during high school Bagley participated in a PBS interview of Ronald Reagan. As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), he was a proselyting missionary in the Bolivia La Paz Mission from 1975‚Äì77. In 1978 he received his degree in political science, with a history minor, from Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. Bagley has two sons, Miles and Alec. Will Bagley, Pat's older brother, is an accomplished historian of the western United States and coauthored This is the Place!: A Crossroads of Utah's Past with Pat in 1996. In October 2009, while reacting to recent statements by Dallin H. Oaks, an LDS Apostle, about gay marriage protesters and religious freedom, Bagley commented that he was \\"retired\\" from the church, though not bitter or angry, and considers his LDS life a \\"good experience\\" and \\"in my blood.\\" Cartooning In 1977, during a finance class at BYU, Bagley doodled a political cartoon, which he submitted to the student newspaper, The Daily Universe. This became his first published cartoon, which was reprinted in Time Magazine just weeks later. Bagley submitted more cartoons to the Universe and targeted campus issues, such as the Brigham Young University Honor Code. Some believe the attention from his cartoons helped change the policy. After graduation, Bagley briefly worked as a caricaturist in the nearby Orem Mall, before being hired as the editorial cartoonist at The Salt Lake Tribune, where he still produces a daily cartoon. His cartoons have appeared in The Washington Post, The Guardian of London, The Wall Street Journal, Newsweek, and The Los Angeles Times. Over the years, he has produced more than 6,000 cartoons for the Tribune. He is syndicated in over 450 American newspapers and his work is regularly featured at Daryl Cagle's Political Cartoonists Index (Cagle.com) and in The Best Editorial Cartoons of the Year. Cagle ranks Bagley as the second most popular political cartoonist on his index. Bagley is also an illustrator and author of independent political cartoons and children's books. His liberal political stance contrasts with the conservative state of Utah, and has influenced several books of political cartoons and humor, including 101 Ways to Survive Four More Years of George W. Bush, Clueless George Goes To War!, Clueless George Is Watching You!, and Clueless George Takes on Liberals!. Bagley describes himself as a moderate-Republican who became a liberal independent during the presidency of George W. Bush. Bagley often addresses the predominant Utah culture of conservative politics and the LDS Church. Bagley's joking about Jell-O consumption in Utah helped motivate the Utah State Senate to declare in an official 2001 Legislative Resolution that Jell-O is \\"a favorite snack food of Utah.\\" Olympic pins For the 2002 Salt Lake Olympics, Bagley designed many popular commemorative pins that poked fun at local themes, including a \\"Seven Brides for One Brother\\" pin and a \\"Crickets Make Me Barf\\" seagull pin. During the Olympics, Bagley sold out of his Utah-themed pins and many in high demand were sold at inflated prices. After the events had ended, Bagley continued to produce pins as the only recognized \\"pin artist\\" in the world. Honors *In 1992, Bagley received the Wilbur Award for Religious Communication from the Religious Public Relations Council for a cartoon in the April 23, 1991 Tribune. He was the first cartoonist to receive the award, which is given for \\"outstanding communication of religious values in the news and entertainment media.\\" *Bagley's 2002 book Dinosaurs of Utah and Dino Destinations was nominated for the Utah Children's Book of the Year. *In 2006, Bagley was honored by the Utah Headliners Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists as the best editorial cartoonist in Utah. *Bagley was dubbed \\"Best Illustrator\\" by Salt Lake City Weekly in their 2007 Artys awards, which annually honor the best artistic talent in the city. *Bagley was the recipient of the 2007 Torch of Freedom Award from the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah. *Bagley was awarded the 2009 Herblock Prize for editorial cartooning by a unanimous panel of judges, made up of Garry Trudeau, Jules Feiffer and John Sherffius, representing the Herb Block Foundation. *Bagley was a finalist for the 2014 Pulitzer Prize in Editorial Cartooning \\"for his adroit use of images and words that cut to the core of often emotional issues for his readership.\\" Publications * Mormons: History, Culture, Beliefs: 2004, White Horse Books () Children's books * If You Were a Girl in the Time of the Nephites: 1989, Deseret Book () * If You Were a Boy in the Time of the Nephites: 1989, Deseret Book () * I Spy a Nephite: 1991, Deseret Book (), reissued 2000, White Horse Books paperback () * A Nephite in the Works: 1992, Deseret Book () * Hana, the No-Cow Wife: 1993, Deseret Book () * Where Have All the Nephites Gone: 1993, Deseret Book () * Peek-A-Boo Magic: 1995, Buckaroo Books () * Norman the Nephite's & Larry the Lamanite's Book of Mormon Time Line: 1995, Deseret Book () * Showdown at Slickrock: 1995, Buckaroo Books () * Norman the Nephite and the A-maze-ing Conference Center: 2000, White Horse Books () * Dinosaurs of Utah and Dino Destinations: 2001, White Horse Books () Political satire * 101 Ways to Survive Four More Years of George W.

Apart from pop and rock, it also promotes hiphop, urban, dance, crossover, roots and world music. The institute also decides about subsidies for Dutch music venues. Nowadays the institute cooperates with other Dutch music centers as Music Center the Netherlands. International activities The Dutch Rock & Pop Institute is involved in various international activities, either as originator or as a partner. In 2001 in conjunction with the Conamus Foundation it launched the campaign musicXport.nl, which stimulates the promotion of Dutch music in neighbouring Germany. Due to budget cuts by the Dutch government, the campaign has temporarily been put on hold. The Dutch Rock & Pop Institute visits conferences abroad as well, including Austin Texas's South By South West, New York's CMJ and Berlin's PopKomm. Media Centre The Media Centre of the Dutch Rock & Pop Institute is the source of information on pop music from the Netherlands. The Multimedia Centre contains a large collection of books, magazines and sound carriers. The main focus of the Multimedia Centre is on Dutch pop music. However, the collection of books and magazines also contains all important international titles. FRET FRET is a free publication about the pop music scene in the Netherlands. It contains interviews, reviews, a gig guide and background information about Dutch bands and artists. This Dutch-language magazine is available at record stores and venues in the Netherlands.

It is a non-profit public charity that is dedicated to supporting the Lake Tahoe region ‚Äì now and into the future‚Äîbuilding a more prosperous community by partnering with donors to make their charitable giving more meaningful, by supporting quality programs provided by local non-profit organizations and by providing community leadership on emerging issues. History Founded in 1996 by community members, Parasol is a donor-centered organization that, through the generosity of its donors, has granted over $33.6 million to charitable causes since its inception. Due to its rural nature, the North Lake Tahoe region, especially Incline Village and Crystal bay, does not receive basic services that county agencies might normally provide. Non-profit organizations thus found it necessary to take responsibility to make sure that the community's essential needs were met. The Parasol Foundation was created to ensure that such efforts would be successful by allowing the individual agencies and charities to work together‚Äîallowing them to combine resources and avoid working to cross- purposes. The Donald W. Reynolds Community Non-Profit Center In 1999, Parasol received a construction grant from the Donald W. Reynolds foundation to build a non-profit foundation center. This building, the Donald W. Reynolds Community Non-Profit Center was completed and dedicated in 2002. The DWR Center is a model in philanthropy. It not only provides non-profits with valuable grants that support operational costs, it also promotes collaboration, rather than competition, among organizations. In 2013, the DWR Center housed 16 non-profit residents and has provided local non-profit organizations with grants valued at $6.5 million for the DWR Center office space, storage space and meeting room space. Parasol AmeriCorps Program The Incline Village/Crystal Bay community has also benefited over the past 12 years from the Parasol AmeriCorps Program. The members focus on education, basic services, public safety and the environment. In 2011, over $1,054,265 in volunteer value was provided to the community through the Parasol AmeriCorps Program. Members served 29,269 hours in 2011 as well as recruited and managed 2,088 community volunteers that served an additional 19,114 hours. ;Education and Youth Development *American Association of University Women *Cymbal Foundation *Destination Imagination *The Diamond Peak Ski Education Foundation *Incline Boosters Club *Incline Elementary School *Incline Middle School *Incline High School *Incline Star Follies *Lake Tahoe School *P.E.O.

He spent time in the Army, and later while living in Manhattan he took photographs, including those of African American Muslim rallies and Bowery drug-dealers, that appeared in Time and Life magazines. Business Career Shavitz eventually settled in Maine, discovered beekeeping as a source of income and met Roxanne Quimby, who would sell his wax candles at local fairs. An increase in sales and production led to them launching Burt's Bees in the 1980s. As the partnership and business grew, operations were set up in North Carolina in 1994. Soon thereafter, the partnership between Shavitz and Quimby waned, leading to Quimby buying out Shavitz's stake in the company. In 2007, Clorox purchased Burt's Bees for more than $900 million.

Staatsbib., Clm. 4453) is considered a superb example of Ottonian art because of the scope, planning, and execution of the work. The book has 276 parchment pages (334 by 242 mm, 13.1 by 9.5 inches) and has twelve canon tables, a double page portrait of Otto III, portraits of the four evangelists, and 29 full page miniatures illustrating scenes from the New Testament. The cover is the original, with a tenth-century carved Byzantine ivory inlay representing the Dormition of the Virgin. Produced at the monastery at Reichenau Abbey in about 1000 CE., the manuscript is an example of the highest quality work that was produced over 150 years at the monastery.  Description  Otto III seated in Majesty. Gospel Book of Otto III. The cover of the book is a tribute to its contents; it is jeweled with a centerpiece consisting of a Byzantine ivory inlay of the Dormition of the Virgin. The inlay was placed on the cover rather than inside the manuscript because the text of the four gospels does not include reference to the Virgin Mary's death. The book's cover was considered so beautiful that the book was commonly taken unopened to church services as a symbol of Christ, even if the text was not used in the service. The book was extremely valuable and represents the height of Ottonian culture. One of the most important elements of the book is its portrait of the emperor which highlights its dedication to him. The portrait uses hierarchic scaling to identify him as the main subject by making him larger than the others and having him sitting in a temple. The Otto III portrait does not include a reference to God. The majesty of the scene is enough to imply the emperor's divinity. Personifications of Rome and Provinces of the Empire approaching Otto III. The portrait of Otto also shows two military men on one side of him and two clergy on the other. The facing leaf shows four women appearing to approach him. They represented the four provinces of his empire (Germany, France, northern Italy, and the Slavic east) and are reminiscent of Christ being approached by the Magi. The location of the portrait of Otto in the book between the canon tables and the portrait of St. Mathew, the first evangelist, is where a portrait of Christ is found in other gospel books. The perfection in this portrait of Otto is in the details, the colors and the representation of the figures. The extensive illuminations throughout the book are flat with no three-dimensional proportions and done with fine detail and brilliant colors. They are generally placed near the text to illustrate the scenes from the New Testament. The decorations on the canon tables are influenced by manuscripts from the Carolingian era. Both Otto III and his Carolingian predecessor, Charlemagne, were fascinated with the ancient Romans. The book reflects that fascination. For example, the frieze has gables that are similar to the \\"roof plants\\" in gospels written at the Charlemagne Court Schools. This copying in his Gospels shows Otto's interest in incorporating work from Charlemagne's time and from ancient times. One of the plates in the book, XIX, shows Christ entering Jerusalem before his crucifixion. He is alone except for a man observing him from a tree, some figures looking on from below, and two boys attempting to cross the border between the lower into the upper area of the picture to place their clothing under the hooves of the donkey carrying Christ. The symbolism in the page and the artistic production make this work one of the best of Ottonian art. The Footwashing of St Peter. The Gospel Book of Otto III The illumination Footwashing of St. Peter, shows iconography that is included in many prior works, but transformed in this book. The stares of the other disciples, the glance and gesture of Christ, and the use of the ceremonial canopy with gold introduces high drama. It reflects back to art showing Moses removing his shoes at the burning bush and art in an early tenth-century Byzantine bible.  Ottonian Art  The reign of Otto III, his ancestors, and some of his successors is known as the Ottonian period and art produced then is termed Ottonian art. The Ottonian period started in 955 and continued until the late 11th century. The Ottonian emperors were Saxons and they controlled areas of Germany, Switzerland, part of Serbia, and northern Italy (modern day designations). They were allies of the pope and built a palace in Rome to be near him. They used their connection to the pope to bolster their claim to a God-given right to rule. The Ottonian emperors felt they were the equal to the greatest rulers. Because of the strength of the Byzantines, the Ottos also sought to be close to them. Otto III's mother was a Byzantine princess. They also benefited from exposure to art from these other areas. Otto III was the third and last in a line of Ottos that were emperors. All were designated by the pope to be Holy Roman Emperors. Otto was only three when his father, Otto II, died and he became king. Otto III was designated Holy Roman Emperor by the pope when he was 16. His reign was not without controversy, For example, he and the pope responded to a rebellion by mutilating the leader's face and blinding him. The leader was one of Otto's former teachers. He is recognized as one of few individuals to have had such a great impact by the age 21 when he died in 1022. His advisors, who were talented and well known, did not always agree, but did achieve cohesion due to Otto's character. Following Otto III the emperor's title went to Henry II and then to several Saxon rulers. The Ottonian period ended with Henry IV. The art produced in the Ottonian period was intimately tied to the leaders, the Ottos. They were the patrons or donors for the works and were sometimes depicted in the books. While the Ottonian works were produced in abbeys and monasteries, they were based on the work done in the Court Schools of Charlemagne. The work evolved to include reflection of work done in the Late Antiquity and Byzantium. Several great works were prepared during the Ottonian period in addition to the Gospel Book of Otto III, including the Book of Pericopes, the Ruodprecht Psalter, and the Quedlinburg Gospels. The influence of the political and religious leaders resulted in the founding of several additional centers of excellence in book production, including Cologne school, the Echternach school, and Trier (one of the more importation schools in the late period). Of course, the quality of the work and the desire to emulate antiquity was not limited to manuscripts. Buildings were constructed with copies of the facades of Roman structures. Statues and tapestry emulated the ancients. Small gifts copying ancient models were produced as gifts for royalty and the wealthy.  Importance  Otto III was influenced by Charlemagne's interest in ancient art. Otto's interest included ancient Roman sculpture, painting, architecture, metal work, and manuscripts. Often medieval emperors modeled behavior and art on the classical history. The works of the Ottonian period can be traced back to work done during Charlemagne‚Äôs reign. Evidence is found in the comparison of evangelist portraits in the Lorsch Gospels produced at one of the Court Schools of Charlemagne to the portraits in the Codex Gero produced by artists in the Reichenau monastery. The comparison shows that the artists at Reichenau used the work from the Charlemagne era as the model for their work. The art produced at the Reichenau monastery was recognized as exemplary. Figures in Ottonian works and art produced by others were often presented with in a frontal view, which is used for Christ and rulers. The first letter of a page (in addition to the calligraphy, human figures, and illumination) was considered art, particularly with Ottonian art. Sometimes the first letter occupied an entire page, with intricate borders on the page and complex interlacing within the letter. Following the Carolingian precedent, the calligraphy was more important to the Ottonians than the pictures. Manuscripts during this period were developed at some of the major monasteries and in the bishops' schools. Historians are able to trace the development of techniques from the early 10th century at Reichenau to works done there in the late 11th century so that they can identify works from the Ottonian period. Since the book was written before the invention of the printing press, it was prepared manually. The scribes and artists would work for years on one book. Extensive labor was required; often the same person that wrote the book prepared the materials. The hides of animals were dried and processed to make the parchment for the book. Inks were mixed. The parchment was lined to facilitate the lettering. An existing version was used by the scribe as the source. Artists added elaborate and detailed illustrations. Finally, a cover was added to the book. For the most lavish books, the cover would have jewels and ivory engravings. The book with its ivory carving and jewels is a fine example of these techniques. The lack of social status held by the artists and scribes that produced the illuminated books is evident from the lack of attribution in the books. A few scribes, such as Liuthar, were recognized. The book was thought to have been produced by the Liuthard Group in the abbey due to its superb quality and style. The Benedictine abbey at Reichenau produced high quality manuscripts between 970 and 1010 or 1020 for the wealthy, kings, bishops and emperors. They are highly valued works because of the quality of the illuminations and miniatures and the precision of the text. The monks at the Reichenau scriptorium produced manuscripts of such artistic and historic value and innovation that ten of them, including the book, were listed in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register in 2003. The number of well-regarded manuscripts from the Reichenau monks is testimony not only to their artistic talents, but also their strength and dedication (the work was slow, exacting, and took a lot of time, so producing so many documents of such excellence is a tribute to them). The importance of the book is indicated by its decorations, one of the important high points in Ottonian book illumination, and the placement of the miniatures in chronological order. The manuscript was given by Otto III to Henry II who donated it to the Cathedral of Bamberg where it remained until 1803. It was removed to the Bavarian State Library in Munich to protect the valuable materials in its binding and cover.

The roadway continues west as county- maintained Motters Station Road to St. Anthony Road, the old alignment of US 15 that leads to Mount St. Mary's University and the National Shrine Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes. History The first section of MD 76 was completed by 1921 as a concrete road from US 15 to Motters, a station on the Emmitsburg branch of the Western Maryland Railway. The highway between Rocky Ridge and Motters was completed in 1938. Aside from minor improvements, MD 76 has not changed since.

They lie near the northern rim of the Taklamakan Desert and east of the city of Turpan. Their striking gullies and trenches caused by erosion of the red sandstone bedrock give the mountains a flaming appearance at certain times of the day. The mountains are approximately long and wide, crossing the Turpan Depression from east to west. The average height of the Flaming Mountains is , with some peaks reaching over . The mountain climate is harsh and the extremely high summer temperatures make this the hottest spot in China, frequently reaching or higher. One of the largest thermometers in China--a popular tourist spot-- is on display adjacent to the mountain, tracking the surrounding ground temperatures. A number of important palaeontological remains have been found in the area, see e.g. Lianmuqin Formation and Subashi Formation. Silk route The Tian Shan with the Flaming Mountains at bottom Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves on cliffs under the Flaming Mountains In ancient times, the merchant traders traversing the Silk Route in Southeast Asia avoided the mountains by stopping at oasis towns, such as Gaochang, built on the desert's rim at the foot of the Flaming Mountains and near an important mountain pass. Oasis towns became respite stops for traveling merchant traders. Buddhist missionaries often accompanied traders on busy international trade routes. During this time trade boomed on the Silk Route. Buddhist monasteries and temples were built in the busy trading centers and in nearby remote mountain spots. The Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves site lies in a gorge under the cliffs of the Flaming Mountains near the pass by Gaochang. It is a complex of seventy Buddhist cave grottoes dating from the 5th to the 9th centuries CE, many with thousands of murals of Buddha. Literary fame The Flaming Mountains received their name from a fantasy account of a Buddhist monk, accompanied by a Monkey King with magical powers. The monk runs into a wall of flames on his pilgrimage to India in the popular 16th century novel, Journey to the West, by Ming dynasty writer, Wu Cheng'en. The novel is an embellished description of the monk Xuanzang who traveled to India in 627 CE to obtain Buddhist scriptures and went through a pass in the Tien Shan after leaving Gaochang. Mythology According to the classical novel Journey to the West, the Monkey King created a disturbance in the heavens and knocked over a kiln, causing embers to fall from the sky to the place where the Flaming Mountains are now. The Princess Iron Fan possessed the magical Iron Fan, and used it to remove the fire on the Flaming Mountains, though since she only fanned once each time, it would only able to be removed for a year, before the fire started again. The pilgrims encounter an extremely hostile range of volcanic mountains and can only pass if the volcanoes become inactive. Her fan, made from banana leaves, is extremely large and has magical properties, as it can create giant whirlwinds. Using this advantage, she made the residents near there revered her as their goddess, and they would have to give her some food if they want her to solve their problem about the Flaming Mountains. In a Uighur legend, a dragon lived in the Tianshan Mountains. Because the dragon ate little children, a Uighur hero slew the dragon and cut it into eight pieces. The dragon's blood turned into a scarlet mountain of blood and the eight pieces became the eight valleys in the Flaming Mountains.

Augustinian Priory  Next to St Joseph's Church are the remains of an Augustinian priory dedicated to St Mary which was founded some time after 1140. The site was possibly an earlier monastic centre dedicated to St Donain. The priory was a daughterhouse of Monaincha and appears to have been strongly associated with the ruling O'Meara dynasty. In 1450 the warden pleaded that, on account of poverty, the value being under 16 marks he and his convent could not be decently maintained, nor repair the cloister and other buildings, most of which had been burnt down during wars. Donogh O'Meara was building a castle here in 1541. In 1597 Miler mac Grath was granted the 'site, circuit and precint of the late priory of Thome' with a 'butt of a ruined castle with certain ruined chambers thatched'. At the dissolution the property of the priory of Toomevara is listed as 'one castle, wall and other buildings on the site'.

Andreacchi is active as a novelist, poet and playwright. Biography Grace Andreacchi was born and grew up in New York City. She was educated at the Academy of Mount St. Ursula High School, and went on to study theatre at the Stella Adler Studio. A brief period on the stage was followed by the study of philosophy, first at Hunter College (New York City), and then at Binghamton University (Binghamton, New York). In her final year she received a fellowship to study at Bedford College, London. During this time she specialised in the philosophies of ancient Greece and medieval Europe, as well as additional studies in Chinese philosophy and freudian thought. Since 1989 Andreacchi has lived in Europe, moving first to Paris, then rural Normandy, and later to Berlin (1994‚Äì1998) and London, where she now resides. In 2008 she founded Andromache Books, a writers' cooperative, to publish literary fiction and poetry. Works Her first work was the play Vegetable Medley (1985, Soho Repertory Theater, New York and Boston Center for the Arts, Boston, Massachusetts), an experimental work fusing elements of comedy and melodrama in a highly poeticised language. Her first novel, Give My Heart Ease (1989), received the New American Writing Award and was translated into Slovenian as Pomiri mi srce. Admired by some critics, others found its frank depiction of an abusive sexual relationship disturbing.Kirkus Reviews, 1989 and Publisher's Weekly, 1989 Her 1993 novel, Music for Glass Orchestra, garnered much critical acclaim for its wildly beautiful, surrealistic style.Review of Contemporary Fiction, June 1993The Sunday Times, September 12, 1993 Set in Paris, it contains a wide-ranging discourse on the music of J.S. Bach, with special attention to the Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin. Her first collection of poetry, Elysian Sonnets and Other Poems (1990) was published as a chapbook in Paris.Beyond Baroque Chapbook Archive . In 1995 Andreacchi was a collaborator in the project Violin Music in the Age of Shopping, a work by avant-garde composer and violinist Jon Rose. For her contribution Andreacchi was made an Honorary Fellow of the Rosenberg Foundation (Sydney, Australia).The Rosenberg Archive . The novel Scarabocchio (1995), an architecturally adventurous ‚Äòinverted fugue‚Äô, is based on Goethe‚Äôs Italian Journey, and continues the discussion of Bach through the character of ‚ÄòBarton Beale‚Äô, a lightly fictionalized Glenn Gould. The short novel Poetry and Fear (2001) is set in the Berlin opera world, and uses the myth of Orpheus to explore themes of love and loss. Later works showed an increased emphasis on Christian spiritual themes. A continued interest in the culture of the far east is reflected in Two Brothers (2007), a version of the Korean pansori tale Heungbu and Nolbu. Recent work has shown a turning away from Christianity towards an avowedly feminist point of view. ..

The song has achieved a large amount of popularity in both the mainstream and Christian radio. From the album's release to the Winterjam 2008 tour, the band opened their set with this song. For the Comatose Tour, this song was placed second in the set list. It has stayed there through the 2008 festival season before and in the 2009 Comatose tour. However the band started reopening their setlist with the song again for the \\"Awake and Alive Tour.\\" It is the fourth single by Skillet to be released to physical media. R&R; magazine counted it as the No. 1 most played song in 2008 for Christian rock radio with 4,505 plays. Track listing # \\"Whispers in the Dark\\" (Edit) - 3:13 Music and lyrics The song is based on a driving rock sound with heavy guitars (tuned in drop B tuning). It is written from the perspective of God, to humans, affirming that \\"you'll never be alone\\". This can be taken as a response to a previous track on the album, Falling Inside the Black. Cooper said that the song is about feeling alone and looking around but nobody seems to be there- but God is there. Music video A music video was shot for this video at the same time as the video for \\"Rebirthing\\", and the two were released around the CD release at the same time. The \\"Whispers in the Dark\\" video consists of the band playing in a dark room filled with rain and rose petals (whereas the \\"Rebirthing\\" video takes place in a very bright room with windows looking out to the sky). The video includes a closeup shot of Ben Kasica's guitar solo, one of many that have been complimented at Skillet shows. It also includes lead singer and bassist John Cooper's popular trick of swinging his bass around himself and catching it again. Both videos have received play on Gospel Music Channel.

The previous Lotus application suite, Lotus SmartSuite, is also unrelated. IBM discontinued development of Lotus Symphony in January 2012 with the final release of version 3.0.1, moving future development effort to Apache OpenOffice, and donating the source code to the Apache Software Foundation.  Features  IBM Lotus Symphony consists of: * IBM Lotus Symphony Documents, a word processor program * IBM Lotus Symphony Spreadsheets, a spreadsheet program * IBM Lotus Symphony Presentations, a presentation program * A Web browser based on Firefox 3 Each application is split into tabs. Symphony supports the OpenDocument formats as well as the binary Microsoft Office formats. It can also export Portable Document Format (PDF) files and import Office Open XML files. Previous support for Lotus SmartSuite formats was disabled in Symphony 3. Symphony is based on Eclipse Rich Client Platform from IBM Lotus Expeditor (the shell) and OpenOffice.org 3 (the core office-suite code). IBM Lotus Symphony: Buzz Lotus Symphony Version 3 is NOW AVAILABLE , 21 October 2010 In 2009, IBM created development tools for BlackBerry smartphones to link to IBM's business software, which also allow opening ODF file-formats, following a full Symphony later. Lotus Symphony 3.0.1 added enhancements including support for one million spreadsheet rows, bubble charts, and a new design for the home page.

History  Symphony has its roots in the IBM Workplace Managed Client component of IBM Workplace. In 2006, IBM introduced Workplace Managed Client version 2.6, which included \\"productivity tools\\" ‚Äî a word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation program ‚Äî that supported ODF.

The code in Symphony is the same as that for Notes 8's productivity tools.Ed Brill, Introducing IBM Lotus Symphony, desktop productivity software at no charge, 18 September 2007 ‚Äî see comment 41 IBM released version 1.0 of Lotus Symphony in May 2008 as a free download, and introduced three minor upgrades through 2008 and 2009. In 2010, IBM released version 3.0. Symphony 3.0 was based on OpenOffice.org 3.0, though not under the LGPL but under a special arrangement between IBM and Sun (who required copyright assignment of all outside OpenOffice.org contributions). and includes enhancements such as new sidebars in its user interface and support for Visual Basic for Applications macros, OpenDocument Format 1.2, and OLE. Symphony 3.0 was originally planned to include other existing OpenOffice.org modules, including an equation editor, database software, and a drawing program.Edward Mendelson, IBM Lotus Symphony Beta review, \\"...Now the Bad News\\" section, 21 September 2007 The software was developed by IBM China Development Laboratory, located in Beijing,IBM Translates Lotus Symphony for a Globally Integrated World which now develops Apache OpenOffice.

The USASF was founded in December 2003 by cheerleading competition sponsors National Cheerleaders Association, Universal Cheerleaders Association, Cheersport, and America's Best to develop a standard set of safety rules and competition regulations and conduct the Cheerleading Worlds. History The first organization to call themselves \\"All Stars\\" and go to competitions were the Q94 Rockers from Richmond, Virginia, founded in 1982 by Hilda McDaniel. All-star teams competing prior to 1987 were placed into the same divisions as teams that represented schools and sports leagues. In 1986 National Cheerleaders Association (NCA) decided to address this situation by creating a separate division for these teams lacking a sponsoring school or athletic association, calling it the 'All-Star Division' and debuting it at their 1987 competitions. As interest in these \\"all-star\\" teams grew, various organizations and competitions were formed, often with their own sets of rules and potentially lax and/or dangerous safety standards. The USASF was formed in 2003 as a governing body for \\"all-star\\" cheerleading, funded by Varsity Spirit. The main objective was to create a standard set of rules for judging that are to be followed by all competitions sanctioned by the Federation. At the same time, cheerleading coaches from all over the country organized themselves for the same rule making purpose, calling themselves the National All Star Cheerleading Coaches Congress (NACCC). In 2005, the NACCC was absorbed by the USASF and became their rule making body. In late-2006, USASF facilitated the creation of the International All-Star Federation (IASF), the first international governing body for cheerleading. In 2008 a decision was made to begin a biannual process, making the 2009-10 season and the 2010-11 season the first two-year rules cycle. The Cheerleading World Championship right The foremost competition for All Star Cheer is the annual World Cheerleading Championships, also known as Cheerleading Worlds, held at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando, Florida. The USASF hosted the first Cheerleading Worlds on April 24, 2004. In 2007, over 100 teams from 15 different countries competed in the event.

It inhabits forests mainly in East Africa. It forms a superspecies with the many-colored bushshrike (C. multicolor) and the two are sometimes considered to be a single species. Description It is 18-19 centimetres long. It is variable in appearance and has several different colour morphs. All birds have green upperparts, grey crown and upper back, yellow tip to the tail and dark bill and legs. The orange morph has a black mask and forehead and orange underparts, shading to yellow under the tail. The red morph is similar but redder on the throat and breast with yellow on the belly and undertail-coverts. The buff form has buff underparts and a pale throat. The black morph has an entirely black face, forehead, throat and breast and green belly and undertail-coverts. Females are duller than the males with less black on the forehead. Juvenile birds have buffish underparts with dark barring and yellow edges to the wing-feathers. The song includes repeated bell-like phrases. Pairs often duet together. Distribution and habitat It has a patchy distribution and is restricted to montane forests in many areas. It forages in the canopy and middle levels of the forest and joins mixed-species feeding flocks outside the breeding season. There are three subspecies: C. n. nigrifrons occurs from central Kenya southwards through Tanzania to northern Malawi. C. n. manningi is found from the south-eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to northern Zambia.

The main armament of the Chathams was eight BL 6-inch (152 mm) Mk XI guns. Two of these guns were mounted on the centreline fore and aft of the superstructure and two more were mounted on the forecastle deck abreast the bridge. The remaining four guns amidships were raised to the extended forecastle deck, which meant that they could be worked in all weathers. All these guns were fitted with gun shields. Four Vickers 3-pounder (47 mm) saluting guns were also fitted. The armament was completed by two submerged 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes.Lyon, Part 2, pp. 55‚Äì57 Construction and career The ship was laid down on 3 January 1911 by Chatham Royal Dockyard and launched on 6 November. Upon completion in December 1912, Chatham was assigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron and was transferred to the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean in July 1913.Gardiner & Gray, pp. 53‚Äì54 Chatham remained part of the Mediterranean Fleet at the outbreak of the First World War, and was initially employed in the search for the German battlecruiser and cruiser , searching the Straits of Messina on 3 August.Naval Staff Memorandum No. 21 1923, pp. 1‚Äì2, 12‚Äì13. After the two German ships avoided the British forces and reached Turkey, Chatham was detached for operations in the Red Sea on 13 August 1914.Naval Staff Memorandum No. 21 1923, pp. 49‚Äì50. On 20 September that year, the German light cruiser sank the old British cruiser in Zanzibar harbour. In response, Chatham was ordered to East Africa to join up with sister ships and and take part in the hunt for K√∂nigsberg, with Chathams Captain, Sidney R. Drury-Lowe commanding the operation. Chatham arrived at Zanzibar on 28 September, but her participation in the search was delayed when she ran aground off that port on 1 October. While Chatham was only lightly damaged, she was under repair at Mombasa from 3 October to 15 OctoberNaval Staff Memorandum No. 10 1921, pp. 35‚Äì37, 42. Pr√§sident On 19 October Chatham s boats found the German steamer Pr√§sident upriver from the coastal town of Lindi, German East Africa (now Tanzania). While the Germans claimed that Pr√§sident was a Hospital ship, the British found no medical equipment on board and had not been notified of the German ship's status and found documents aboard Pr√§sident indicating that she had acted as a supply ship for K√∂nigsberg. The German ship was claimed as a Prize of war, but as Pr√§sidents engines were broken down, Chatham permanently disabled Pr√§sidents machinery before continuing the search for K√∂nigsberg.Naval Staff Memorandum No. 10 1921, pp. 43‚Äì45.The Naval Review Vol. 3 No. 3, pp. 479‚Äì480.

On 12‚Äì13 July 1915 she provided gunfire support to an attack along the Achi Baba Nullah dry water course on Cape Helles,Corbett 1923, p. 72. and on 6‚Äì7 August took part in the Landing at Suvla Bay, acting as the flagship of Rear-Admiral John de Robeck, in command of Naval Forces during the operation.Corbett 1923, p. 94. On 20 December Chatham acted as the flagship for Admiral Weymss during the evacuation from Sulva Bay and Anzac Cove.Corbett 1923, pp. 238, 241. In 1916 she returned to home waters and joined the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet. On 26 May 1916, Chatham struck a mine off the Norfolk coast and had to be towed to Chatham for repairs. The ship was placed in reserve in 1918. After the war, Chatham was lent to the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy from 1920 to 1924,J. O'C Ross, The White Ensign in New Zealand (1967); Howard, The Navy in New Zealand (1981). and was sold for scrapping on 13 July 1926 to Thos W Ward, of Pembroke Dock.Lyon, Part 3, p. 51 In 1922, the crew of Chatham donated a cup to the New Zealand Football Association.

Ciepli≈Ñski was executed at Mokot√≥w Prison in Warsaw, with a shot to the back of the head by the Polish secret police, UrzƒÖd Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa. For almost fifty years, his name was expunged from all books by the Communist government of the PRL.The club of Lukasz Cieplinski Early years Ciepli≈Ñski was born in the village of Kwilcz, Kreis Birnbaum (Polish: Powiat miƒôdzychodzki), in then German Empire's Province of Posen, now back again Poland. Although Poland was partitioned at the time, he grew up in a patriotic family. As his native village was located on the then-western outskirts of Polish ethnic territory, his parents ‚Äì Franciszek Ciepli≈Ñski and Maria (n√©e Kaczmarek) ‚Äì taught him Polish history and traditions as a child. His great-grandfather fought in the Greater Poland Uprising (1848), while his older brothers fought in the Greater Poland Uprising (1918-1919). His parents owned a bakery store, and Cieplinski was one of their eight children. Young Ciepli≈Ñski began his education at elementary school in Kwilcz, but completed it in Miƒôdzych√≥d in 1929. After graduating from high school, Ciepli≈Ñski enlisted with the Third Cadet Corps in Rawicz, and in 1934 enrolled in the Military College in Ostr√≥w Mazowiecka. In 1936, the young officer joined the 62nd Infantry Regiment in Bydgoszcz, where a year later he became leader of an antitank unit. World War II Ciepli≈Ñski was twenty-six years old when World War II began. He participated in the Battle of the Bzura and in the Kampinos wilderness, trying to get through Wehrmacht lines to besieged Warsaw. His distinguished service during the Polish September Campaign was recognized by General Tadeusz Kutrzeba, who personally awarded him Poland's highest military decoration for valor, the Cross of the Virtuti Militari for destroying six German tanks. Ciepli≈Ñski, who was the commanding officer of the antitank unit of the 62nd Infantry Regiment, destroyed the tanks on September 17, 1939, near Witkowice. In a twist of fate, it was also on that same date that the Soviet Union invaded Poland. Resistance movement In mid-September 1939, Ciepli≈Ñski managed to reach Warsaw and took part in the defense of the city. When the Polish capital surrendered, he decided to continue the struggle. In late fall 1939, he moved to the environs of Rzesz√≥w and from there crossed the Carpathian Mountains to Budapest where he came into contact with the Polish military. In early 1940, after further military training, Ciepli≈Ñski returned to occupied Poland. He was apprehended by the Ukrainians in Baligr√≥d, who handed him over to the Germans. Imprisoned in Sanok, he escaped in April 1940 and, dressed as a Lemko peasant, eventually reached nearby Rzesz√≥w. Successes of Ciepli≈Ñski and his men After his return, Ciepli≈Ñski began to participate in the Polish resistance movement. Promoted to the rank of commandant of the Rzesz√≥w District of the ZwiƒÖzek Walki Zbrojnej, later called the Home Army, he distinguished himself in several operations. Ciepli≈Ñski took part in numerous operations against German outposts in the area of Rzesz√≥w, Dƒôbica, and Kolbuszowa. A skilled and gifted activist, he organized a successful intelligence network. His men liquidated some 300 Gestapo agents and collaborators. In the spring of 1944, his unit captured V-1 and V-2 rocket parts. Furthermore, Ciepli≈Ñski's operatives located Anlage S√ºd, a secret headquarters of Adolf Hitler, which was located in a rail tunnel near the town of Strzy≈º√≥w. In the spring of 1944, Ciepli≈Ñski, now promoted to the rank of major, carried out the so-called \\"Kosba Action\\", aimed at the liquidation of the Nazis in the area of Rzesz√≥w. Soon afterwards, when Operation Tempest began, his unit, reorganized as the 39th Infantry Regiment, participated in the operations that lead to the liberation of Rzesz√≥w from the Nazis on August 2, 1944. After World War II In the summer of 1944, Rzesz√≥w and its adjacent area was captured by the Soviet Red Army. The Soviet Union ordered all Home Army members to give up their arms and to join the Ludowe Wojsko Polskie. Mindful of the tragic fate that befell thousands of Home Army soldiers who enthusiastically cooperated with the Red Army only to be later imprisoned and executed by the Soviet NKVD and SMERSH units, Ciepli≈Ñski strongly opposed and resisted this idea. Anti-communist movement On the night of October 7‚Äì8, 1944, Ciepli≈Ñski's unit conducted an unsuccessful operation to free some 400 Home Army soldiers, imprisoned by the Soviet NKVD at the former Nazi Gestapo regional headquarters at the Rzesz√≥w Castle. In early 1945, he moved to Krak√≥w and participated in the anti-communist NIE resistance movement. In mid-1945, he joined Wolno≈õƒá i Niezawis≈Ço≈õƒá (WiN), assuming command of the Krak√≥w District of WiN and soon thereafter assumed command of the Southern Poland District of WiN. Fearing Communist reprisals, in early 1947, along with his wife Jadwiga, Ciepli≈Ñski moved from Krak√≥w to Zabrze, where they opened a textile store. Under his skillful leadership, the WiN organization thrived, mostly in the propaganda and intelligence operations. Even though the situation in Stalinist Poland was quickly deteriorating, Cieplinski repeated a Latin adage: \\"Against all hope, I shall keep hope\\" (\\"Contra spem spero\\"). Ciepli≈Ñski made a number of attempts to get in touch with Western Allies and to inform them of the situation in Poland. Finally, he was successful on one occasion when, with assistance from officials of the Belgian embassy, he was able to smuggle documents informing the West about the dire situation in Poland. The Soviet NKVD and UrzƒÖd Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa were on his trail during this entire period and, finally, on November 28, 1947, he was arrested in Katowice. Imprisonment On the following day, Ciepli≈Ñski was transported to the infamous Mokot√≥w Prison in Warsaw. He was kept in solitary confinement for months. The light in his cell was lit 24 hours a day. He was brutally tortured, with NKVD agents personally overseeing the interrogation. Since his legs and hands were broken, other prisoners had to carry him in blankets for meals. As a result of brutal torture and endless interrogations, Ciepli≈Ñski went deaf in one ear. These tortures lasted for three years. In a letter smuggled from prison, Ciepli≈Ñski wrote to his wife, \\"I was lying in a puddle of my own blood, I had no idea what I was asked about and what I was saying\\". He also wrote to his beloved son, Andrzej: \\"You see, son, together with mom we always prayed so you would grow up praising Christ, serving our Country, and making us happy. I wanted to help you with my experience, but unfortunately these are perhaps my last words to you. I will soon be murdered by the Communists for fighting for ideals I am conveying to you in my testimony. Mom will tell you about my life, and I will be dying believing that you will not let me down\\". In another letter dated January 28, 1951, also smuggled out of prison, Ciepli≈Ñski wrote to his wife > My Dearest Wiesia, I am still alive, although these are likely to be my last > days. I am held [in the cell] with a Gestapo officer. They [the Nazis] > receive letters [from their families], and I don't. And I would like so much > to receive even few words written by your hand [‚Ä¶] I thank God that I can > die for His holy faith, for my Country, and that he gave me such a good > wife, and such a happy family life. The trial which finally took place in October 1950 before the Military Court in Warsaw was presided over by Chief Military Judge Colonel Aleksander Warecki (real name Warenhaupt), Major Zbigniew Furtak, Major Zbigniew Trylinski and Lt. Col. Jerzy Tramer, who served as the Public Prosecutor. On October 14, Ciepli≈Ñski was sentenced to five consecutive death sentences, plus 30 years. His family appealed to then Communist president of Poland Boleslaw Bierut for commutation of the death sentence, but Bierut refused, stating that Cieplinski and his men \\"in their hatred of Poland and the Soviet Union, did not hesitate to commit any crime\\". The execution took place at 6 a.m. on March 1, 1951 in the basement of the UrzƒÖd Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa prison in Warsaw. Cieplinski was shot in the back of the head in Katyn style. His body was never returned to his family, and his burial place remains unknown to this day. On the same day, his six WiN co-conspirators were also shot at five- to ten-minute intervals. They were: Adam Lazarowicz, Mieczys≈Çaw Kawalec, J√≥zef Rzepka, Franciszek B≈Ça≈ºej, J√≥zef Batory, and Karol Chmiel. Comic book In early December 2007, Rzeszow's branch of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) announced publication of the first IPN-sponsored comic book. The work which presents the life of Lukasz Cieplinski was conceived by the Rzeszow University's Wojciech Birek (author of screenplay) and Grzegorz Pudlowski, who drew all the pictures. It is entitled \\"Against hope\\", and has 46 pages, but as Birek says, Cieplinski's life deserves many more pages.Krakow Post, First historical comic book published by Institute of National Remembrance The book begins in a courtroom in the early 1950s, during Cieplinski's trial. Then it moves back, presenting his life - Polish September Campaign and his conspiratorial activities. The authors also mention other resistance members who cooperated with Cieplinski. Legacy For fifty years, Ciepli≈Ñski's name was banned from public use. His widow, Wieslawa Cieplinska and their little son Andrzej, who was only 3 years old when his father was executed, were ostracized, lived in poverty, and remained under the ever-watchful eyes of the Polish secret police. After the collapse of the Communist People's Republic of Poland, the new democratic government honored him posthumously with Poland's highest decoration for valor, the cross of the Virtuti Militari 5th Class, at the decree of President Lech Kaczy≈Ñski on May 3, 2007. Commemorative plaques dedicated to his memory can be found in Rzesz√≥w and Kwilcz; the 28th Elementary in Rzesz√≥w has been named after him, as well as a street in the same city. The monument in his memory was unveiled on 17 November 2013 in Rzesz√≥w.SuperNowo≈õci, Pomnik pp≈Çk. ≈Åukasza Ciepli≈Ñskiego ods≈Çoniƒôty None of Ciepli≈Ñski's tormentors were ever brought to justice.

Waller (1808‚Äì1872) was an American missionary in Oregon Country and an early leader at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon. He was a native of Pennsylvania and helped found the first Protestant church west of the Rocky Mountains in 1843 in Oregon City. Early life Alvin Waller was born in Abington, Pennsylvania, on May 8, 1808.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. He was ordained as a Methodist minister and preached on the East Seaboard of the United States. There he married Elpha White in 1833, and they would have five children. In 1839, Waller was recruited by Oregon missionary Jason Lee to join his mission in the Willamette Valley. Waller sailed for Oregon in October 1839 aboard the Lausanne and arrived in Oregon in May 1840 as part of the Methodist Mission's \\"Great Reinforcement\\" that included other such as Ira L. Babcock, George Abernethy, Josiah Lamberson Parrish, and Gustavus Hines. Oregon Once in Oregon Waller was assigned to start a new branch of the main mission at the falls on the Willamette River. There with the assistance of Lee the Willamette Falls Methodist Mission was established in 1840. The land claim came into conflict with that of the Hudson's Bay Company at that site, so Doctor John McLoughlin of the HBC took a personal land claim at the site.McLoughlin Land Survey Claim, 1843. The Oregon History Project. Retrieved on September 18, 2007. In 1844, McLoughlin and Waller settled the disputed land claims with Waller and the Methodists receiving townlots, $500, and from McLoughlin. In 1842, he helped to build the Methodist church at the falls in what became Oregon City, Oregon. Finished in 1844, the church was the first Protestant church west of the Rocky Mountains.Horner, John B. (1919). Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature. The J.K.

Waller Hall at Willamette In 1847, Alvin Waller moved to Salem, Oregon, and served as pastor to the old mission's congregation until 1857. The following year he settled a Donation Land Claim in the city. Waller began working with the Oregon Institute and helped in its transition to Willamette University in 1853.

He is known for being among the first writers to use the term communism in its modern sense. He wished to transform the ideals of the Enlightenment philosophers into practice.http://www.colonialsense.com/Society- Lifestyle/Census/Person/Victor_dHupay/8731.php  Life and works  In 1746 Victor d'Hupay was born into an aristocratic family in the village of La Tour-d'Aigues in the Luberon, Provence. d'Hupay began writing his first texts on the rural economy when he was seventeen. He believed agriculture to be the basis of wealth, and followed the Physiocrat movement that advocated an economy based upon it just as Marquis de Mirabeau did. He followed the example of Baron de La Tour-d'Aigues, who was interested in land development and had one of the largest libraries of the time on this subject. d'Hupay challenged the display of wealth of Bruny, and other barons, because he, as a follower of Rousseau, wanted a simpler more rural life away from the tumult of cities. He read Enlightenment philosophers, and wished to put their ideas into action. In 1770, he bought the bastide of Puget in Fuveau and became nobleman. During his life, Victor d'Hupay divided his time between La Tour-d'Aigues, Aix-en- Provence and the neighbouring village of Fuveau, to the south of Montagne Sainte-Victoire. The restored family bastide in Fuveau was run according to his principles. Once his country house in Fuveau was restored, he published his first book, Projet de communaut√© philosophe, which advocated the idea of living in a sort of commune. In the book, he told how he wanted to gather in his new home a circle of friends for a life in community. In 1785, he defined himself as a communist author - a word that has existed since the twelfth century to designate certain forms of pooling of goods - in the sense of a supporter of the community of goods. Around this time, just before the French revolution, he was referred to as a communist in a book review by Restif de la Bretonne; according to some sources, this was the first time that the word \\"communism\\" was used in print in its modern sense. During the Revolution, Victor d'Hupay became enthusiastic about new ideas. He corresponded with Mirabeau and Bernardin de Saint-Pierre. He presented several projects of national education and models of government to the National Assembly, and militated for the suppression of marriage, which he saw as a form property owning. Despite his commitment to the revolution, he was imprisoned under the Terror and his house was looted. He wrote a little under the Empire and died at Fuveau in 1818, at the age of seventy-two.

The album was recorded in January 2007 over the course of 18 days, and released on September 17 of the same year. After signing to Stolen Transmission, the album served as the band's major label debut and their first album not to be released independently through The Control Group. The production of the album was handled entirely by John Goodmanson with the majority of the lyrics composed by the band's singer and frontwoman Ryann Donnelly. Donnelly serves as the main singer on the album, with bassist Jonah Bergman performing backing vocals. Envisioned as an album about falling inlove during the apocalypse, the album was inspired by horror films, with the lyrics composed from themes such as death and tragedy. The album presents its themes in a theatrical, over-the-top and often campy style. It was promoted by two singles; lead single \\"Dude, Where's My Skin?\\" and \\"The Plastic Surgery Hall of Fame\\". Both songs received music videos directed by Brian and Brad Palmer. In early 2008, the band completed a nationwide tour, opening for the Seattle- based band Aiden. The album received positive reviews from music critics, who praised Donnelly's singing, the often melodic composition, and the morbid themes expressed on the project. While a critical success, the album failed to achieve any chart positions. The album generated some controversy from concerned individuals who accused the album of promoting satanism and murder. The band announced their breakup on November 20, 2009, which meant that Abominations was their last album together as a group. Background Following the release of Schoolyard Heroes' sophomore album, Fantastic Wounds, the band had begun to find commercial success in not only the Seattle rock scene, but in Olympia and other cities in Washington. The band had generated enough interest to eventually be signed to Stolen Transmission, an imprint label of Island Def Jam Music Group. Record producer John Goodmanson took interest in the band and served as the producer for Abominations, their third studio album. Goodmanson had previously attracted success as a producer for established acts such as Blondie and The Blood Brothers. All four members of the band remain on the project, with Donnelly serving as the main writing force. Writing and recording Vintage horror films served as an inspiration for the album. Donnelly admitted to being an admirer of horror actor Vincent Price. Like all of the band's projects, the album takes several of its themes from b-movies and horror films. Horror films had always been a substantial influence on the band; bassist Jonah Bergman's father had taken him to double features as a kid. Donnelly had admired horror actor Vincent Price and wished to present vintage horror aesthetic into the project. Brian K. Vaughan's dystopian comic book Y: The Last Man served as inspired for the song \\"Cemetery Girls\\". Bergman was credited for writing the hook on \\"The Plastic Surgery Hall of Fame\\". The album contains elements of concept albums, with the album taking place during the apocalypse. Donnelly had stated that the album is what would happen to a couple's relationship during the end of the world. The narrative of the album centers around the premise of every single male in the entire world suddenly dropping dead, and what would happen if all males spontaneously died for no apparent reason. In an interview with Sentimentalist Magazine, Donnelly went into detail about the composition of the album, stating > \\"We‚Äôve literally written about horror movies, like straight from the screen > kind of thing, but this one is about horrific human beings and human nature, > and the dark side of things, and there‚Äôs still a lot of beautiful ways to > sort of twist that and write about that. And \\"Cemetery Girls,\\" is about all > of the men just dying, for no apparent reason, and these women are rising up > and taking over the world, and it‚Äôs sort of the mixture of emotion that > comes with things ending. Particularly this apocalyptic setting where > there‚Äôs a lot of death, but also strength that rises from it.\\" While the album goes over fictional themes, Donnelly noted that the album still contained real-world social commentary. Donnelly mused, \\"when you look at the news, it‚Äôs really easy to get sucked into this mentality of is the world coming to an end?\\" and assured that she still wanted the album to be something you could dance to. To prevent the album from being to depressing, the band attempted to present the album with the aesthetic of a b-movie, with a comical, overly theatrical tone. Bergman stated that while the album goes go over dark topics and contains graphic imagery, the band wanted to offer the listeners something positive in nature. He warned people not to look to deep into the music and stated that the band was a way for the members to vent. Abominations was recorded in 18 days, which Donnelly described as the most \\"delightful, pleasurable recording experience\\", commenting that she was saddened when the band had run out of material to record. The band spent their loose time watching episodes of classic horror series like The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits. Content Album opener \\"Dude, Where's My Skin?\\" begins the album with horror-movie imagery. The track opens with the disturbing refrain of \\"take off your skin and dance with me\\" with Donnelly screaming in an operatic manner, over eerie guitar riffs. \\"The Plastic Surgery Hall of Fame\\" features guttural screaming from both Donnelly and Bergman, with the song serving as a duet between the two. Bergman's bass is less pronounced on the track, allowing the two trade lines more clearly. Donnelly sings the line ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so pretty‚Äù while Bergman screams back ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so dead!‚Äù in a \\"demonic tone\\". Donnelly declares the line \\"I am the devil and I‚Äôve come to do the devil‚Äôs work\\" on track \\"Cemetery Girls\\", morbidly referencing the famous line spoken by serial killer Charles \\"Tex\\" Watson, member of the Manson Family. The track has a highly melodic riff and Donnelly screams her verses \\"like a battle cry\\". ‚ÄúViolence is All the Rage‚Äù, despite the alarming title, has been described as having similarities with pop music in nature. While the's song's subject matter may be disturbing, the production and vocal arrangements have been described as something that could be a backing to a Kelly Clarkson track. The track switches from heavy metal verses to disco-influenced choruses, and Donnelly's performance on the track has been compared to No Doubt era Gwen Stefani. \\"Children of The Night\\" features a chugging guitar in the style of math rock, with a percussive breakdown with eerie gothic moaning. The more horror-themed tone of the album takes a break on \\"The Last Man on Earth\\", which is a tender ballad. The track is an exercise in desperation, with Donnelly singing \\"you and I are the King and Queen of nothing\\" amongst a haunting guitar-based platform. Donnelly asserts that her \\"lipstick tastes like murder\\" on \\"Razorblade Kisses\\" which contains guitar playing in the style of post-hardcore music. \\"Sometimes They Come Back\\" has been compared to the type of music produced by bands At the Drive-In and The Blood Brothers. ‚ÄúBeautiful Woman Hunter\\" offers a showcase for Brian Turner‚Äôs drums and cymbal performance, and Steve Bonell‚Äôs guitar which shifts from slower portions to a chaotic, punk-ish breakdown. The song exhibits Donnelly's more scream-heavy singing. \\"All the Pretty Corpses\\" is more poppy in nature, with epic, disparate sonic elements juxtaposed against more rock-centric riffing. Album closer \\"Screaming ‚ÄúTheater‚Äù in a Crowded Fire\\" begins like a musical at first, and then transforms into a showcase for Bonell's continuously evolving riffs. The track is a macabre love song between a murderer and her victim, and contains the only time on the album when Donnelly and Bergman trade verses outside of a chorus. The track features the two intimately singing together, with Bergman shouting the visceral line \\"you smeared my blood like a whore‚Äôs mascara‚Äù back at Donnelly. Promotion Lead single \\"Dude, Where's My Skin?\\" debuted on the website PureVolume on August 8 of 2007. \\"The Plastic Surgery Hall of Fame\\" was chosen as the second single, and received a music video helmed by Brian and Brad Palmer. The video features kids in a cult, and was followed by a music video for \\"Dude, Where's My Skin?\\" The band embarked on a nationwide tour, opening for the Seattle-based band Aiden in support for the album. Donnelly expressed that performing was an important aspect to her music, stating that \\"the more visceral a response the audience can have, the better. I don‚Äôt ever want to hide behind pyrotechnics, or too much show. I think that we are a really solid live band and really solid performers, and our music is the most important element of the equation. If your music isn‚Äôt there, it‚Äôs not going to matter; it‚Äôs just going to be a circus.‚Äù The album was released onto iTunes on September 17. Controversy EarCandy, a Seattle- based music blog, had printed an irate letter authored from an anonymous writer. The writer described the band as avowed satanists, accusing the band of wanting to corrupt the nation's children and \\"drive them to murder with their fascination with the dark and evil world of Satan.\\" The letter had attracted the interest of the newspaper Seattle Post Intelligencer, who published the story. Once the newspaper had published the story, readers visited the website of the band, with one commenting that the content had horrified him, stating that the band's lyrics glorified \\"death, dismemberment, murder and suicide.\\" A group of concerned parents were so offended by the gruesome nature of the band's lyrics that they were motivated to form a petition against the band. The petition read that they were attempting to stop a tragedy before it began, and accused of the band of promoting satanism. Spin magazine interviewed Bergman about the accusations presented against the band, and Bergman assured that the parents were simply out of touch with their kids, calling the outrage ridiculous. Bergman incited parents to talk to their children, assuring that the parents were underestimating the intelligence of their kids. He noted that the members of the petition had \\"clearly never heard our music or seen our shows\\", and that the band wasn't about worshipping the devil, but having a good time. Reception Website Three Imaginary Girls commented that the production on the album was pristine and mature, with the songs \\"teeming with sinister chords and spine-tingly good vocals.\\" They continued, writing that Abominations was the \\"perfect soundtrack for this ghoulish, All Hallows Eve season.\\" Blake Solomon of AbsolutePunk noted that he wasn't generally a fan of horror imagery, but commented that \\"the tales told within Abominations can get gruesome, but the flair and range of near-undead songstress Ryann Donnelly gives me just enough courage to continue on, soiled underwear and all.\\" Exclaim!'s Sam Sutherland mused that the album was more accessible than their first two albums, writing \\"it‚Äôs great to know that after two fantastic, almost wholly ignored albums Schoolyard Heroes aren‚Äôt giving up. In fact, they‚Äôre getting better\\". Carrie Alison of Sentimentalist Magazine praised the album and viewed that Donnelly was destined to be the female equivalent Gerard Way, commenting \\"horror-punk be damned, I‚Äôll meet these guys behind the gym anytime.\\" Allmusic reported that the album \\"is full of surprisingly catchy songs, which shouldn't imply even remotely that the Schoolyard Heroes have turned pop. Quite the opposite. The angsty, horrorshow feeling of both the lyrics and the sonics are heavier than ever, belying both the appearance of the band (who look like art school geeks) and the immediate appeal of the music.\\" Travis Hay of Seattle Post Intelligencer felt that the band had shown impressive growth from their first two albums, and critiqued that the album ‚Äúis chock full of playfully gruesome, over-the-top lyrics (i.e. ‚ÄúYou smeared my blood like a whore‚Äôs mascara‚Äù), though it won‚Äôt leave you with nightmares. Instead you‚Äôll be left with 11 wickedly fierce songs from Seattle‚Äôs favorite fearsome foursome.\\" Hannah Levin of Seattle Weekly wrote that the hiring of John Goodmanson was a wise decision, commenting that his production \\"revs up the band's inherent vitriol and pageantry while razor- tuning the goth-pop notes for broader appeal without blunting the edges.\\" According to Levin, tracks like \\"Cemetery Girls\\" and \\"All the Pretty Corpses\\" sound like \\"darkly catchy future teen anthems\\". Ben Borneman of Sputnikmusic gave a more mixed review of the album of the album, commenting that the individual members of \\"Schoolyard Heroes can call their own shots as they as they experiment with their sound and hone their chops in this yet-to-be- defined genre. Let us hope they learn to play to their strengths, as Abominations is a fun, albeit uneven listen which offers the promise of some interesting material in the future.\\" Kosh Williams of Ultimare Guitar described that the album had parts that are both \\"metal and punk popping up here and there on the record\\", noting \\"but it would be too \\"pop\\" for metal lovers and too \\"heavy\\" for punks. It‚Äôs a great album only for one category of people‚Äîthose who love experiments and something interesting.‚Äù Track listing Personnel  Information taken from Abominations liner notes. * Nabil Ayers - management * Jonah Bergman - primary artist, bass, guitar, vocals, backing vocals * Jonah Berman - choir * Blag Dahlia - pre-production * Steve Bonnell - primary artist, guitar, * Cemetery Girl Choir - additional personnel, performer * Zach Davidson - choir/chorus, backing vocals * Ryann Donnelly - primary artist, choir, vocals, backing vocals, guitar * John Goodmanson - audio engineer, audio production, engineer, mixing, producer * Elie Goral - assistant photographer * Nouela Johnston - choir * Nouela Oake Johnston - additional Personnel, keyboards, piano, backing vocals * Sarah Lewitinn - A&R; * Nate Manny - art direction, design * Christian McKnight - management * Ashley Redshaw - choir, backing vocals * Caitlin Schooley - choir, backing vocals * Maureen Trantham - choir, backing vocals * Brian Turner - primary artist, drummer * Melissa Yaden - choir, backing vocals  References External links *Official Site Category:2007 albums Category:Schoolyard Heroes albums Category:Albums produced by John Goodmanson ","title":"Abominations (album)"},{"id":"13330463","text":"Franja Partisan Hospital on 15 September 2007, three days prior to the hospital's near destruction in a flood Franja Partisan Hospital () was a secret World War II hospital at Dolenji Novaki near Cerkno in western Slovenia. It was run by the Slovene Partisans from December 1943 until the end of the war as part of a broadly organized resistance movement against the Fascist Italian and Nazi German forces. The wounded treated there were soldiers from both the Allied Powers and the Axis Powers. Although the Wehrmacht forces, which occupied territory that had been annexed by Italy, launched several attempts to find the hospital, it was never discovered. Today it exists as a museum. It has been protected as a cultural monument of national significance. History and overview thumbright200pxNumerical plan of hospital buildings before the near destruction: 1\\\\.

Building for burying limbs 16\\\\. Bunker over the Pasica Gorge Built in difficult and rugged terrain in the remote Pasica Gorge in western Slovenia by Slovene Partisans, the hospital opened in December 1943 and saw continuous improvements until May 1945. The hospital was located deep inside German-occupied Europe, only a few hours from Austria and the central parts of the Third Reich. German military activity was frequent in the general region throughout the operation of the hospital. The hospital's entrance was hidden in the forest, and the hospital could only be reached by bridges. The bridges could be retracted if the enemy was in the vicinity. In order to preserve the secrecy necessary for a clandestine hospital to operate, the patients were blindfolded during transportation to the facility. The hospital was also protected by minefields and nests of machine guns. As the hospital is in a gorge, the many trees and camouflaged buildings provided protection against air reconnaissance. The founder and first builder of the hospital was Viktor Volƒçjak, but the hospital was named after its manager and physician, Franja Bojc Bidovec,Photo of Franja Bojc Bidovec who began working there in February 1944. Among the doctors working in the hospital there was also an Italian, Antonio Ciccarelli.\\"L'ANPI di Cividade del Friuli in visita al Museo della Bolnica Franja in Slovenia\\", in Patria Indipendente, 24 July 2011, pg. 3. Extremely well equipped for a clandestine partisan operation, the hospital remained intact until the end of the war. It was designed to provide treatment to as many as 120 patients at a time, but saw almost ten times as many during its operation. Most of its patients were wounded anti-Nazi resistance fighters, who could not go to regular hospitals because they would be arrested. Among its patients were many nationalities, including one wounded German enemy soldier who, after being treated, remained in the hospital as a member of the hospital staff. The hospital operated until 5 May 1945. It became a part of the Cerkno Museum in 1963. In 1997, an American Association of Air Force Veterans issued an award to Franja Hospital for saving and treating downed American pilot Harold Adams. In 2003, a stamp was issued by the Slovene Post Office to mark the 60th anniversary of Franja Hospital, and became the stamp of the year in Slovenia.Posta Slovenije d.o.o.: De≈æela znamk: Filatelija: Po≈°tne znamke: Znamke leta 2003, posta.si; accessed 16 July 2015.

He was the first player signed by the Seattle Seahawks in 1975. Williams was an All-American for the University of Washington in football and track, as a decathlete. He was inducted into the Husky Hall of Fame in 2014. Following his pro football career, Williams was an executive working in property management for more than four decades. He helped to establish a church on Kauai in 2001, which met in a tent until the North Shore Christian Church building was completed in 2014.  Early life and education  Born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Williams was the fourth of seven children of Joseph Laverne Williams and Cleo Maye (n√©e Hill) Williams. His family moved in the winter of 1951‚Äì1952 to Tacoma, Washington, where they lived near his paternal grandparents. Williams traces his interest in football to , when his family acquired a television and began to watch NFL football on Sundays. His older brothers Joe and Jerry played football, and they introduced him to playing the game in their front yard. Williams recounts how Jerry played catch with him and taught him ball drills: \\"We would be ten yards away from each other and begin by throwing the ball to each other from many angles and positions. He would find my weakest positions and work on those even more.\\" At the end of the drill, they did ten pushups for every dropped ball. In Tacoma, Williams attended the former Hawthorne Elementary School, Gault Junior High School, and Lincoln High School, where he graduated in 1963. He earned a total of twelve high school varsity letters: three in football, three in basketball, three in decathlon, and three in track and field. He also played on the 1962 Connie Mack Cheney Studs baseball team.  Collegiate sports career: football and track  Williams earned six varsity letters at the University of Washington, three in football, where he played tight end, and three in track, in an era when freshmen were not eligible for varsity teams. Coaches of the PAC-8 named Williams to the 1965 All-Pacific Athletic Conference team. As a freshman, in his first decathlon in 1965 he qualified for the National AAU Decathlon Championships, and placed 14th among 30 competitors in the Olympic tryouts. Williams received his baccalaureate degree in 1973 at the University of Washington. He was named to the Washington's Husky Hall of Fame 2014 class.  Professional football career  Williams was a professional football player for ten seasons, eight as a wide receiver in the NFL, and two seasons as a wide receiver in the World Football League. During his pro career, he caught 183 passes for 2,768 yards and 25 touchdowns in the NFL. He was also the first player signed by the Seattle Seahawks, and worked for the team as a spokesman during their start-up year, but never played for the Seahawks due to a knee injury.  St. Louis Cardinals, 1967‚Äì1971  Williams was the first draft pick of the Cardinals, the sixteenth overall pick in the first round in 1967 NFL draft. He was a wide receiver for five seasons for St. Louis, starting in 53 of 67 games in which he played, catching 162 passes, and receiving for a total of 22 touchdowns. He was in tenth place on the 1968 NFL leaderboard for 56.8 receiving yards per game. In 1969, he made fifth place on the NFL leaderboard, with 56 receptions.  San Diego Chargers, 1972‚Äì1973  In 1972 Williams was traded to the Chargers, where he met and formed a friendship with Johnny Unitas. He played in 12 games, starting in 6.  Pittsburgh Steelers, 1973  The Steelers claimed Williams on waivers from the Chargers in 1973. He played in one regular season game, and in a playoff game. The Steelers released him from his contract in the spring of 1974.  Southern California Sun, 1974‚Äì1975  Williams reported to the Southern California Sun training camp on June 5, 1973. He played his last pro football in the World Football League, with two seasons at the Southern California Sun, and he scored a total of twenty touchdowns. Williams is credited with holding the players together throughout the winter of 1975 when they had not received paychecks since the previous September. Club president Larry Hatfield said, \\"But we would have lost a lot more [players] without the job Dave did. His role in keeping the team together was extremely substantial He took the time to understand our problems in depth and convey them to the players.\\"  Seattle Seahawks, 1976  Williams was the first to sign with the Seahawks in the fall of 1975, and he worked as spokesman and assistant to the general manager. He gave over 90 presentations promoting the Seahawks to organizations throughout the Pacific Northwest. He injured his left knee in a promotional event prior to the start of their first season in 1976, and retired from professional football in the fall of 1976.  Later life and career  In the mid-1980s, Gene Upshaw contacted Williams to head the steering committee for the new NFL Retired Players Association (RPA), and he chaired the association from 1984 through 1988. The purpose of the RPA was to provide \\"powerful national advocacy and collegial support for retired professional football players, their families and the community at large\\". As spokesman for the RPA, Williams pointed out that half of the 120 retired players in the Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, had no pension. Subsequently, the NFL Players Association asked Commissioner Pete Rozelle and the League to \\"give pensions to the players who pioneered the game.\\" Since leaving professional football, Williams has had a career of more than forty years in property management, a business he began while playing for the Chargers. Williams has been an executive for multi-unit property management companies, including Equity Residential and Apartment Investment and Management Company, among others. He and his wife Sherry incorporated \\"David L. Williams Management Consultants, LLC\\" in 1999.  Faith and memoir publication  Williams and his wife helped found an evangelical Christian church on Kauai in 2001. They served as Deacons and Church treasurers and worshipped in a tent for years. North Shore Christian Church was built thirteen years later and opened in January 2014. In 2017, Williams published his life story, combined with stories he had transcribed from tapes of his father's memories, entitled My Best for Him, My Memoir.  Athletic records, honors and awards  Williams' high school football kudos included all-city, all-conference, and all-state honors in both junior and senior years; the State of Washington's 1963 AA 120 hurdles champion; High School football All American in senior year; team captain senior year; and he was ultimately named to The Seattle Times High School Football Team of the Century in 1999. He won national collegiate honors both in football and in track and field events. In his junior year, Williams was named to the Associated Press All-America football second-team for 1965. The Associated Press also honored him In 1966 with All-America honorable mention in football, and he won fourth place at the NCAA in the 440-yard hurdles, as well as sixth place in the 120-yard hurdles. He was on the 4x110-yard relay team at the 1967 NCAAs that won fifth place. Williams completed his university career in 1967, making second-team All- America (Associated Press), first-team All-Pacific Coast and he had been invited to the 1966 East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game, 1967 Hula Bowl, and 1967 Chicago College All-Star Game. Williams was also a four-time All-American in track and field. Between 1964‚Äì1967, he earned six collegiate varsity letters. The Husky Hall of Fame lists Williams' records that have stood for more than half a century: \\"[He] still holds the UW records for receiving yards in a game with 257 vs. UCLA in 1965; for receptions by a tight end in a game with 10 (twice in 1965, vs. both UCLA and Stanford); receiving TDs in a season by a tight end (10, 1965); and for career receiving yards per catch by a tight end (18.3)\\" See also * Washington Huskies football statistical leaders  References  External links  * 2014 Husky Hall of Fame Ceremony (video, Williams' award and acceptance, from 1:19:08 ‚Äì1:29:36) * Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Cedar Rapids, Iowa Category:American football wide receivers Category:Washington Huskies football players Category:St. Louis Cardinals (football) players Category:San Diego Chargers players Category:Pittsburgh Steelers players Category:Southern California Sun players Category:Seattle Seahawks players Category:American business executives Category:American football tight ends Category:American male decathletes Category:Washington Huskies men's track and field athletes Category:Track and field athletes in the National Football League Category:Sportspeople from Tacoma, Washington Category:Players of American football from Washington (state) ","title":"Dave Williams (wide receiver)"},{"id":"13330717","text":"Sycamore Bank, based in Senatobia, Mississippi, is a regional bank with assets exceeding $170 million City Data, Senatobia, MS and locations across North Mississippi.

After the war, he failed to maintain his place and in 1946 moved to Newcastle United for ¬£4,650, having failed to make a competitive appearance for Middlesbrough, though he did make two appearances in the expanded 1945‚Äì46 FA Cup. At Newcastle, he made an instant impact, scoring twice on his debut in their 3‚Äì1 home victory over Coventry City, but lost his place a few months later. He would eventually go on to score 21 goals in 66 league appearances playing up front and on the right wing. He stayed at Newcastle for three seasons before moving on to Luton Town, where he would make the more appearances than any of his other clubs over the next three years. Again, he moved on, this time to Millwall and two seasons later to Brentford. He finished his career in non-league football with spells at Southern League sides Bedford Town and Dartford.

During the 1960s the United States military worked hard to interdict the movement of men and materiel along the Ho Chi Minh trail. The North Vietnamese were experts in the use of weather and darkness to conceal their movement, and understanding the superiority of American air power put their skills immediately to good use. US forces seeking to impede the steady flow of supplies attempted to locate largely static targets during the day with poor results. The United States Air Force, focused toward nuclear weapons and delivery of such munitions against static strategic targets had spent little effort in expanding its tactical capabilities since the end of World War II. Operation Shed Light sought to rectify this by bringing together improved tactics and technology. The programs were subsequently centered on improved communication and navigation aids for all-weather and night flying, sensor equipment for seeing through clouds, foliage, and darkness, improved equipment and methods for target marking and battlefield illumination, and aircraft and tactics to utilize these developments. In the end, few of the programs would yield applicable results and most of the aircraft developed under its umbrella would largely fall into obscurity. The most applicable developments were those that could be mainstreamed such as the work done on navigation and communication and sensor equipment. Origins The United States Air Force had largely redirected its efforts to the matter of strategic deterrence in the period between the Korean War and deployment to southeast Asia. As a result, it had few serious capabilities for the plethora of conventional missions that became readily apparent with the expanding US commitment to southeast Asia.Schlight, 1988. p. 227 Dedicated attack aircraft were virtually nonexistent, with the exception of the Korean War era A-1 Skyraider. The US Navy was still using the type at the time, and the US Air Force had itself been long interested in the type, with this further reinforced as a result of its advisory role in South Vietnam.Baugher, Joseph F. American Military Aircraft. 18 October 2001. Service of AD Skyraider with US Air Force. Access Date: 17 October 2007 The US supported Republic of Vietnam Air Force was in fact using it as their primary aircraft by 1965.Mesko, 1987. p. 38 These aircraft had directly replaced aging F8F Bearcats in 1962 and the decision was made in 1964 to transition to the type from the then standard T-28 Trojans.Mesko, 1987. pp. 26‚Äì8 As a result of the orientation toward nuclear war, tactical air strikes were flown almost exclusively by the US Air Force between 1964 and 1966 using a variety of fighter bombers intended initially for the delivery of small strategic and tactical nuclear weapons. These types included the F-100 Super Sabre, F-4 Phantom II, and even the F-105 Thunderchief. The F-100 had two fighter bomber variants in service at the time, the F-100C and F-100D, both of which were capable of carrying a nuclear store, and only the latter of which was primarily for use as a strike aircraft and not a fighter. The F-100C had largely been passed to the United States Air National Guard and by 1965 less than two hundred of the aircraft were capable of using cluster bombs or even the largely standard AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile.Knaack, 1986. pp. 121‚Äì2 The F-104C, a fighter bomber version of another fighter, though capable of utilizing conventional air-to-ground stores, was intended as a nuclear weapon delivery platform.Knaack, 1986. p. 182 Only the F-4C and F-4D were available as a true multirole aircraft, and the F-4C had still been used firstly as a fighter when deployed to the theater.Knaack, 1986. p. 266 The only other major non-fighter type in use early on in the conflict was the B-57 Canberra. Strikes in Laos were even conducted for a time using the F-102 Delta Dagger, modified with infrared sensors, and using its internal rocket armament. These strikes proved largely fruitless and were quickly discontinued.Pfau and Greenhalgh, 1978. p. 4 Realizing the need for more dedicated attack aircraft the Air Force combed its inventory and looked to invest in new types. It found itself with an odd selection of obsolete, new, and experimental aircraft, and grasped for immediate solutions. To try and coordinate this effort, a task force was established by Lt. General James Ferguson, then Deputy Chief of Staff for Research and Development. Dubbed Operation Shed Light, it began on 7 February 1966 as a means of coordinating a wide variety of technological and other projects and programs that were being pursued in order to improve the United States Air Force's night fighting capabilities. Outlined in the Task Force's charter as of April were the following: # Identify current equipment, techniques, and procedures being used by the USAF in Southeast Asia. # Identify planned modifications and new equipment being developed for Southeast Asia. # Survey exploratory, advanced development, and operational support projects having a potential application to the problem, indicating current programs or schedules. # Identify voids in our capabilities or efforts. # Recommend courses of action to improve and/or provide new attack capability in 1966, 1967, and the longer term.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 1A-7 In all, the Shed Light Task Force identified nine new weapon systems and seventy-seven research and development \\"tasks\\" in the first five months of operation.Pfau and Greenhalgh, 1978. p. 7 Over the next 5‚Äì10 years it hoped to have a fully functional \\"self-contained night attack aircraft,\\" a single type that would meet the operational need and would be functionally useful in other similar situations. Initial programs Shed Light's initial programs were broken down into a number of categories, the most important being communication and navigation systems, sensors, and illumination and target marking equipment. Also detailed were proposed aircraft modifications and tactics. Communication and navigation Issues of communication and navigation were identified under Shed Light. That air strikes could not be called in effectively and/or guided to the target reduced the effectiveness of air power overall.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 1C-9-11, 15 A variety of communication system improvements and navigational aids, including improvements to the Long-Range Navigation (LORAN) system (specifically LORAN-D) were incorporated into the Shed Light mission.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 1C-31 Sensors Artist's interpretation of an A-1E aircraft with podded LLLTV The sensors to be developed under Shed Light were broken into three categories, Low Light Level TV (LLLTV), Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), and Forward Looking Radar (FLR).United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 1C-41 Two LLLTV systems were in development initially. Both were podded, designed to be added to aircraft already in USAF inventory. The first, produced by Dalmo-Victor under Project 1533, was LLLTV only, but had provision for a laser range finder. It was intended for the A-1E Skyraider. The second, produced by Westinghouse under Project 698DF, contained both the LLLTV and a laser ranger finder. It was intended for either the A-1E or B-57 Canberra series.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 1C-46, 48; Note, Smith, 1966, p. 94 mentions this program, but as \\"Project 1553.\\" One is likely a typo. The second unit would eventually be fitted to the B-57B. The two programs were named projects Tropic Moon I and Tropic Moon II respectively.Pfau and Greenhalgh, 1978. pp. 10‚Äì11 The Tropic Moon I system was essentially obsolete before it was deployed, and tests quickly confirmed this. Only 4 A-1Es were so equipped. The results from the Tropic Moon II B-57Bs were almost as discouraging, with 456 trucks detected on 182 sorties, for only 39 confirmed kills. Both systems were removed from the theatre by the end of 1968.Pfau and Greenhalgh, 1978. p. 20 Artist's depiction of a B-26 with Lonesome Tiger FLIR A prototype FLIR unit had been tested under Project Red Sea in a DC-3 at Eglin AFB, and later in an AC-47 in South Vietnam in September 1965. Using technology developed from those tests, Project Lonesome Tiger was initiated, testing a FLIR unit on two B-26 Invader aircraft. Climate was found to have serious effects on the units, especially humidity, and this fit was not to be put into widespread use.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 1C-55, 59 Improvised mounting of \\"starlight scope[s]\\" in the bomb bay of the B-26 is also mentioned in oral history reports, and this fit was found to be largely impractical.Kittinger, 1974. p. 40Gorski, 1973. p. 51 Illumination equipment and target marking Battlefield illumination was of key importance within the original Shed Light programs. The dominant aerial flare at the time was the Mk 24 Mod 0, developed by the US Navy. Reliability of the units, however, were in question, as was availability. Perhaps of greater concern was existing test data in 1966 that suggested pilot disorientation and flare placement were serious issues. Project Night Owl, conducted in 1954, testing flares dropped from F-86 Sabre aircraft, led to twenty-five percent of pilots reporting experiencing some level of vertigo.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 1B-13 Ironically, initial studies showed that in correcting this problem, issues of insufficient illumination were experienced.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 1B-44 A new flare, designated MLU-32/B99, also referred to as Briteye, was put into development. The new flare burned at 5 million candle power for over five minutes and produced a signal that could be heard by pilots indicating when it was about to burn out. Additionally, the Navy's Mk 33 Mod 0 flare warhead for the 5\\" Mk 16 \\"Zuni\\" rocket motor was tested under Shed Light.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 1C-83-5 Projected delays in the procurement of the MLU-32/B99 led to a proposal to test the Swedish Lepus flare as an interim measure. The Lepus flare was tested, but found to be inferior to the MLU-32/B99.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 14 The issues surrounding flares led to exploration of other methods of battlefield illumination. The Battlefield Illumination Airborne System or BIAS, employed two banks of Xenon ARC lamps (28 total) fitted to a modified C-123B aircraft.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 1C-87 A cooling system was installed on the left side of the aircraft to help dissipate the heat generated. The system was deployed to Vietnam, but it was found that the lamps provided a perfect target for enemy gunners and the system was discontinued.Adcock, 1992. p. 18 Initially it had been proposed that a similar system be installed on the more capable C-130, but the experience during the operational trials brought the whole program to a halt. More unorthodox methods were also explored. Astrosystems International developed a so-called \\"Quartz Chamber\\" which burned pure oxygen and aircraft fuel, converting the chemical energy into light. The system was planned to be evaluated within a year, and installed in a similar arrangement to the more conventional BIAS. A plan, codenamed Moonshine, was also put forward. Moonshine was to be a joint effort with NASA to determine the feasibility of a geosynchronous satellite that could in project light directly down on any desired location.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 8 Ground target marking, which was a key tactic for day time strikes, was investigated. Project 2531 was to investigate target marking munitions, and looked into warheads for the Mk 40 2.75\\" rocket motor, using a variety of chemiluminescent materials.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 39 These were to be loaded with compounds developed under the US Navy's Target Illumination and Recovery Aid (TIARA) program. Initially they used modified M151 high-explosive warheads, but found the amount of compound that could be contained provided poor results.United States, Volume II Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. IIC-147-8 The Shed Light Task Force noted that a lighter case for these compounds was in development. A combination of red phosphorus and a flare was investigated in an attempt to provide a system that could be used at night or during the day.United States, Volume II Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. IIC-145 Aircraft and tactics Artist's depiction of the F-111 SCNA The key aircraft intended to be developed under Shed Light was to be a \\"Self Contained Night Attack\\" aircraft or SCNA. The SCNA would have \\"the necessary night sensors and weapon delivery capability to find and strike targets at night one the first pass without the use of visible artificial illumination.\\"United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 1D-35 However, to provide an interim capability, the idea of using a \\"Hunter-Killer\\" concept using aircraft capable of spotting targets at night and more or less unmodified conventional strike aircraft was proposed.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 1D-80-2 This method had many identified disadvantages, including the need for specialized aircraft and capability differences between the hunter and the killer that might affect their combined operation. The need for specialized aircraft was further exposed by the fact that only three aircraft at all suitable for the hunter role were available to the US military in southeast Asia as of 1966. These included the Army's OV-1B Mohawk, and the USAF's RF-4C Phantom II and RB-57E Canberra aircraft.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 1D-93, 98 There were only two RB-57E aircraft in country at the time, under a special reconnaissance project codenamed Patricia Lynn, and the aircraft were essentially experimental. They also featured Reconofax VI FLIR units, which was an older technology than those being developed under Shed Light.Smith, 1966. p. 8 The RF-4C had the benefit of being of a similar capability to strike aircraft at the time, and a modified hunter version, given a designation RF-4C(H) was to be developed, replacing the camera equipment with LLLTV, FLIR, and Side-Looking Radar (SLAR) units.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 30 A three-phase program had been outlined as early as 1966 for development of the SCNA. The first would be a slower bomber or cargo aircraft, followed, by a jet aircraft of some type. The F-111 was originally slated to become the key SCNA aircraft.Pfau and Greenhalgh, 1978. p. 10 It was ultimately hoped it would incorporate the final versions of all three types of sensors (LLLTV, FLIR, and FLR) developed under the program.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 1B-41 In the initial study, an \\"RF-111\\" was also supposed to be available in the 3‚Äì7-year time frame for use in the hunter- killer pairing.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 1D-106 This time frame led the initial study report to propose using the OV-10 Bronco aircraft in the interim measure, but decided against it because of the inability of the OV-10 to carry all the desired sensor equipment.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 1E-17, 23 As it turned out that while the RF-111A did enter testing in December 1967, it was not easily convertible to and from the existing F-111A configuration. The Air Force looked for alternatives, but the revised RF-111D program was terminated because of a funding shortage in September 1969 and the RF-111A program was cut for good by March 1970.Knaack, 1986. p. 233 Schematic of proposed AS-2D bomb bay configuration With the decision not to use the OV-10 and the desire for an immediate capability, the USAF decided to investigate using the S-2 Tracker aircraft. The proposed aircraft would incorporate the three main sensors under development in a revised aircraft that provided operators for all major systems. The S-2's built-in search light was to be slaved to the LLLTV, crew protection would be provided, and the armament system would be primarily 10 SUU-24/A munitions dispensers in a revised bomb bay. Six wing hard points would be available for additional conventional munitions including bombs, rockets, cluster munitions and dispensers, and gun pods. The program package documentation suggests that the \\"XM-9\\" would be the primary under-wing store.United States, Shed Light Program Package Documentation, Volume II, 1966. p. C2-5, C2-25-30 The XM9 designation is the US Army designation for the SUU-7/A low-drag dispenser pod modified for use on the UH-1B/C Iroquois helicopter.United States, 1969. p. B-3 The two planned pre-production aircraft were to be designated YAS-2D, while the production aircraft would have been AS-2D.United States, TAC Center Monthly Status Report, August 1967, 1966. p. 15 Difficulties in funding, getting the aircraft from the US Navy, and delays in completing the modifications led the USAF to scrap the S-2 based SCNA in January 1968. The F-111 would initially have a mixed record in Southeast Asia, when a detachment of six aircraft from the 474th Tactical Fighter Wing were deployed to Takhli RTAFB in Thailand, in early 1968, as part of Operation Combat Lancer. The remaining aircraft were returned to the United States in November after logging 55 missions, but at the cost of three F-111A's lost in combat. Eventually the aircraft redeemed itself when two squadrons (48 F-111As) from the 474th deployed to Takhli in September 1972, in order to participate in the aerial offensive against North Vietnam under Operation Linebacker II. During this deployment the F-111s operated day and night, in all weather conditions and without electronic countermeasures escort, and relied on less aerial refueling support than other tactical aircraft. Eventually over 4000 missions were logged by the two F-111-equipped units at the cost of six aircraft lost in combat and two lost to operational causes.Thornborough, Tony (1993), Osprey Aerospace, 1993. F-111 Aardvark--USAF's Ultimate Strike Aircraft However, by this point in time, the aircraft was no longer earmarked for conversion into the SCNA role. Black Spot Perhaps the most radical of Shed Light's projects were two C-123K Provider aircraft modified in September 1965 under Project Black Spot.Smith, undated. p. VI Black Spot had been in development prior to the establishment of the Shed Light Task Force, but were subsequently incorporated in under the wide reaching charter. With the scrapping of the AS-2D aircraft program in 1968, the Black Spot aircraft became the prime contenders for Shed Light's first phase. The Black Spot aircraft were to fit under the \\"self-contained night attack capability\\" description and E-Systems of Greenville, Texas was contracted to complete the modifications. These aircraft featured the following sensors:Smith, undated. p. 6 Black Spot NC/AC-123K in flight * Autonetics (A division of North American Aviation) R-132 forward looking radar (FLR) to locate targets for closer inspection via Low Light Level TV (LLLTV) and Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), and featured a Moving Target Indicator (MTI) and automatic tracking capability. * An Avco FLIR. * Westinghouse LLLTV, with automatic tracking. * A Westinghouse laser rangefinder. The LLLTV system was described as having the highest resolution, and was to be the primary means of target location and engagement. The aircraft itself looked radically different visibly from its transport brethren, as the new equipment required lengthening the nose by over .Davis, 1982. p. 50 Also included was an armament system that could carry BLU-3/B (using the ADU-253/B adapter) or BLU-26/B (using the ADU-272/B adapter) bomblets, or CBU-68/Bs cluster bombs.Smith, undated. p. 7, 32Parsch, Andreas. Designation-Systems.net. 31 August 2007. AAU/AAK to AVU/AVK ‚Äì Equipment Listing. Access Date: 17 September 2007 Both the ADU-253A/B and ADU-272A/B are listed as being used in combat, with no mention of combat drops of CBU-68/Bs.Boerschig Jr, Black Spot Weekly Activities Report No.29 (21‚Äì27 Feb), 1969. pg. 5 In addition to the offensive armament, two hand-operated flare launchers were initially provided, until LAU-74/A automatic launchers could be supplied. Besides the automated nature of the LAU-74/A, the unit only required one loadmaster to operate it. The two aircraft, serial numbers 54-691 and 54-698, were first designated NC-123K in 1968 and then redesignated AC-123K in 1969.From Individual Aircraft Records Cards Set, provided as part of information received 24 May 2007 pursuant to Freedom of Information Act request 49112, from the Air Force Historical Research Agency, United States Air Force, Maxwell AFB, AL These NC/AC-123Ks were first deployed operationally at Osan in South Korea between August and October 1968, and flying in support of operations against North Korean infiltrators approaching by boat. The operations in Korea met with a certain level of success and as a result the NC/AC-123Ks were transferred to South Vietnam in November 1968. Once in South Vietnam the aircraft were engaged in missions against the transport of materiel along Ho Chi Minh Trail and in the Mekong Delta Region. The aircraft operated there until January 1969, when they were redeployed to Ubon RTAB, Thailand. Two missions a night were flown from Ubon with two A-1 escorts from Nakhon Phanom RTAB (often referred to simply as NKP) flying cover and providing additional firepower. Initial escort had been provided by F-4s, but the difference in speed and capabilities had made protecting the lower and slower flying NC/AC-123Ks difficult.Smith, undated. pp. 41‚Äì3 The area of responsibility for the first six months was approximately east-southeast from NKP. After that, the area of coverage was a river in southern Laos. The two aircraft were returned to the United States, to Hurlburt Field, Florida in May 1969, where a second round of training occurred. Four crews attended a ground school in Greenville, Texas and returned to Hurlburt where they flew the aircraft for the first time. In October 1969, two crews flew the aircraft to a second deployment at Ubon. The other two crews arrived in early November. After attending jungle survival training at Clark AB in the Philippines missions over Laos commenced. The final phases of the program are slightly unclear. Some sources have missions terminating in early July, 1970 and the aircraft flying to the \\"Bone Yard\\" at Davis-Monthan AFB where they were returned to C-123K standard, then returned to South Vietnam still wearing their camouflage and black undersides for transport duty. The description of the designation in the official documentation supports this, by saying that the NC-123K is \\"Similar to C-123K but partially demodified from AC-123K (modified to an attack configuration) to permit general cargo handling and troop movement.\\"United States, 1974. p. A-18 However, the official history states that combat operations ceased 11 May 1969, with no mention of the second deployment. The second deployment is mentioned in associated documentation, but only as to when the aircraft were scheduled to arrive in Thailand, not when they departed.Boerschig Jr, Black Spot Special Activities Report, 1969. pg. 5 Also, the official aircraft records show both aircraft as transferred to Napier Field, Alabama, where they were still listed as an NC-123K as of December 1972. The purpose of this transfer is unclear. That the official history notes an \\"munitions accident\\" on 19 March 1969 in the chronology, but without any details as to the fate of aircraft or which aircraft was affected, adds additional confusion. It is also suggested that the Black Spot aircraft were never intended to be used in combat. However, as of 1966, twenty production aircraft were planned, for a total cost of $64.7 millionUnited States, Shed Light Program Package Documentation, Volume II, 1966. p. C1-19 (equivalent to $ million in ). There was even a recommendation that the C-130 Hercules be added to the program and used instead.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 1E-117 These projected aircraft were referred to as a Black Spot II.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 24 After the Operation Trial and Evaluation, it was found that the aircraft were not suitably protected and survivable for protracted use in combat zones. No C-130 aircraft are known to have been converted to a Black Spot II standard. Tropic Moon III Layout of the Tropic Moon III B-57G aircraft Shed Light's Second phase eventually turned out to be based on the B-57. B-57 aircraft had already been deployed to southeast Asia and had been the subject of initial sensor evaluations under Tropic Moon II. Tropic Moon III was envisioned as an SCNA that made up for the gross shortcomings of Tropic Moon I and II. Tropic Moon III involved a completely new set of systems, up to date, and infinitely more capable than those previously installed. An entire new aircraft sub- variant, the B-57G, was developed for the purpose with a redefined nose to house the new sensor package. Development of the aircraft experienced major delays during which it was equipped with a laser target designated to be used with the then new first-generation Pave Way laser-guided bombs.Pfau and Greenhalgh, 1978. p. 29 In the end the Tropic Moon III proved to be a capable system, both with conventional ordnance and laser guided weapons, day and night. However, the advent of the side-firing gunship threatened the system. The B-57G conducted its first combat missions in October 1970 during Operation Commando Hunt V.Pfau and Greenhalgh, 1978. p. 66 The kill rates per sortie between the AC-130A/E and the B-57G made it clear which system was dominant in the role of \\"truck hunter,\\" in reference to the primary targets of the campaign.Pfau and Greenhalgh, 1978. p. 64 During the course of the operation the B-57G's claimed over 2,000 trucks destroyed, mostly as a result of using precision guided weaponry.Nalty, 2005. p. 156 In the same period AC-130s were credited with destroying six times this number of trucks.Nalty, 2005. p. 160 While B-57G operations continued, this led to an attempt to modify the system to incorporate gunship elements. One B-57G was modified to house a special bomb bay installation of one Emerson TAT-161 turret with a single M61 20mm cannon as a gunship under Project Pave Gat. This system proved to still be inferior to the capabilities of the AC-130.Pfau and Greenhalgh, 1978. pp. 45‚Äì9 In addition to their laser guided ordnance, Tropic Moon III B-57Gs also used a variety of conventional ordnance, including M36 incendiaries, cluster dispensers, and iron bombs.Pfau and Greenhalgh, 1978. p. 70 These other systems were used in light of a shortage of precision guided munitions available. The B-57G was removed from the theatre in May 1972 coinciding with the withdrawal of the bulk of US Air Elements. Plans remained for the continuation of the B-57G program and there were proposals for multiple wings of aircraft to operate in concert with AC-130s and similar aircraft. Post- conflict spending cuts ended this.Pfau and Greenhalgh, 1978. pp. 91‚Äì2 Other associated programs Other programs were also associated with Shed Light, either coming under its wide-reaching charter, or otherwise being observed. Similar mission requirements meant other services were working on developing their own equipment, and the Shed Light Task Force was under orders from the start to survey all other development (see the original 1966 charter). The US Army had been managing a piece of equipment referred to as S-202, which combined four IR cameras, a display, and operator chains, an artificial illumination component (described as \\"covert ‚Äì UV,\\" using Ultraviolet light to provide illumination), and a freeze display function. Under Project Night Life, the S-202 it was to be tested on a S-61 helicopter by early 1967. The project itself was being funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 1D-110 The Army was also working on Project Dancing Dolls, which was attempting to develop a \\"foliage penetration radar.\\" Triple canopy jungle in Laos meant that being able to see at night might not be enough to acquire a target. The system was being tested on OV-1 aircraft then in use by the Army, but the USAF envisioned the radar as a component on the planned SCNA F-111s.United States, Volume I Operation Shed Light Study Report, 1966. p. 1D-114-5, 120 This program and continued investigations into hunter-killer combinations led to the OV-1B (using SLAR) and OV-1C (using FLIR) aircraft being deployed themselves as hunters, teaming up with gunship aircraft during Operation Commando Hunt.Love, 1989. p. 34 Summary No report on the effectiveness of Operation Shed Light as a whole exists. It is known that there was some discontent among some of its major participants. General John D. Ryan, Commander in Chief of the Pacific Air Forces, complained following the poor showings from the Tropic Moon II program that he was \\"tired of buying everything they send us.\\" He then requested that his staff draft a message that would allow him to send \\"this thing [the Tropic Moon II B-57B] to CONUS [Continental United States].\\" Even in regards to the development of the Tropic Moon III aircraft, the Aeronautical Systems Division was forced to admit that the myriad of delays in that program had been caused by \\"reduced quality control\\" springing from the \\"crash\\" nature of the program.Pfau and Greenhalgh, 1978. p. 42 Shed Light was a crash development project, and was largely unguided. It was tasked with research and development of almost any piece of equipment that might help with the mission outlined in its charter. As a result, few of the programs came to fruition and fewer still left a definitive mark on the conflict. The developments under Shed Light were quickly eclipsed by new aircraft produced under Project Gunship (notably under Gunship II and Gunship III). They were fitted with many of the sensors developed under Shed Light, but took on a life all their own. Shed Light's most visible programs, Black Spot and Tropic Moon, have largely fallen into obscurity. Citations and references=CitationsReferences Government Documentation * Blout, Lt. Col Harry D.

The song is a lament to a lost spouse, and takes on a melancholy tone. Author Christopher Sandford described the song as beginning \\"like a Keith Richards' riff\\" that ultimately moves to \\"one of those great country busted-heart lines, 'Now I work down at the car wash/where all it ever does is rain.'\\" The song was recorded on May 6, 1982 at the Power Station at the end of the \\"Electric Nebraska\\" sessions. Like several other Born in the U.S.A. songs, including \\"Working on the Highway\\" and the title track, a solo acoustic version of \\"Downbound Train\\" was originally recorded on the demo that eventually became the Nebraska album. \\"Downbound Train\\" is one of the few tracks that was successfully recorded at the \\"Electric Nebraska\\" sessions. Though it was not one of the seven singles released from the album, the song nevertheless gained some album-oriented rock radio airplay and was featured fairly regularly on the Born in the U.S.A. Tour. It has been performed sporadically in tours since. Overall, the song has been played in concert about 130 times through 2008. Author Robert Kirkpatrick contended that \\"Downbound Train\\" \\"might be the best song on the album\\", and Debby Bull called it \\"the saddest song [Springsteen]'s ever written.\\" But Springsteen biographer Dave Marsh, writing in Glory Days, did not agree, calling \\"Downbound Train\\" \\"the weakest song [Springsteen]'s released since the second album, ... incredibly sloppy ... The protagonist's three jobs in five verses are only symptomatic of its problems.\\" Other observers analysed it in retrospect as a harbinger, with naturalistic imagery lacing the song throughout in an approach that Springsteen would return to heavily in his Dylan-\\"Series of Dreams\\"-influenced early 1990s.

Synthetic jets are generally formed by flow moving back and forth through a small opening. Synthetic jets are produced by periodic ejection and suction of fluid from an orifice induced by movement of a diaphragm inside a cavity among other ways. (http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781439868102) A jet flow is a fluid flow in which a stream of one fluid mixes with a surrounding medium. An example is a water jet that forms when you put your thumb over the end of a hose. The water mixes with air to form a jet. If you increase the flow of water or move your thumb to change the diameter of the exit, the jet will change dramatically. Jet flows vary depending on velocity and diameter of the flow and the density and viscosity of the fluid (Reynolds number and Mach number). When the velocities in the jet are greater than the speed of sound, important qualitative changes in the flow occur. One such change is that shock waves form.American Heritage Dictionary A synthetic jet flow was so named by Ari Glezer since the flow is \\"synthesized\\" from the surrounding or ambient fluid. Producing a convectional jet requires an external source of fluid, such as piped-in compressed air or plumbing for water. Synjet devices Synthetic jet flow can be developed in a number of ways, such as with an electromagnetic driver (e.g. plasma actuator), a piezoelectric driver, or even a mechanical driver such as a piston. Each moves a membrane or diaphragm up and down hundreds of times per second, sucking the surrounding fluid into a chamber and then expelling it. Although the mechanism is fairly simple, extremely fast cycling requires high-level engineering to produce a device that will last in industrial applications. For hot spot thermal management, the Synjet, commercially offered by Austin, TX-based company Nuventix,Nuventix - Active Thermal Management Hot Spot Cooling, Air Cooled Heat Exchangers: Nuventix was patented in 2000 by engineers at Georgia Tech. The tiny synjet module creates jets that can be directed to precise locations for industrial spot cooling. Traditionally, metallic heat sinks conduct heat away from electronic components and into the air, and then a small fan blows the hot air out. Synjet modules replace or augment cooling fans for such devices as microprocessors, memory chips, graphics chips, batteries, and radio frequency components. Additionally, SynJet technology has been used for the thermal management of high power LEDs Synthetic jet modules have also been widely researched for controlling airflow in aircraft to enhance lift, increase maneuverability, control stalls, and reduce noise.Rupesh B.

It was designed by architect Harold Crawford and in built in 1924. History This brick building replaced the previous creamery, a wood-frame building which burned down in the winter of 1923. The creamery produced specialty butter used in restaurants as distant as New York City. In 1947, the last shipment of butter stamped \\"Viola Creamery Specials\\" left the creamery destined for Chicago. During World War II, higher demand and competition for refrigerated milk trucks made larger creameries viable. Most smaller specialty creameries were forced to close. Between 1946 and 1961, the creamery was used for various purposes, including a cabinet- making shop and a boat building business. In 1961, the creamery was purchased and used to produce honey, handling every step of the process from hive to jar. This business operated until it was closed down by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1987. Between 1987 and 1998, the creamery remained vacant and slowly deteriorated. Vandals began to destroy the building. Windows were broken out and the 12-foot-tall cupola was stolen from the roof. Because of the gaping hole left behind, hundreds of pigeons took over the second level of the building and mice inhabited the rest. In August 1998, the creamery was purchased by Don Helgerson, a bricklayer by trade. He began to restore the creamery to its original condition and had it placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. In 2002, the creamery was renovated into a fine-dining restaurant, the Viola Creamery Steakhouse, which closed three years later in the winter of 2005. In April 2007, the creamery was purchased and converted into a single-family residential home.

He was signed by the Patriots as an undrafted free agent in 2005. He played college football at Villanova. Ventrone was also a member of the New York Jets, Cleveland Browns, and San Francisco 49ers. After a ten-year career as a player, Ventrone joined the Patriots coaching staff as assistant coach - special teams in March 2015, and was announced as the special teams coach of the Colts on February 15, 2018. Early years Ventrone received the nickname \\"Bubba\\" from his father as a child. As a seventh grader, Ventrone and two of his friends founded the Nathan S. Arenson Fund for Pancreatic Cancer Research, which supports research into pancreatic cancer at the University of Pittsburgh. Ventrone attended Chartiers Valley High School in Bridgeville, Pennsylvania where he played football and holds records in track and field. He was a three-time All-Conference player and a Second-team All-State as a senior. Ventrone has a younger brother, Ross Ventrone, who in 2010 signed as an undrafted free agent with the Patriots. He last played for the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2016. College career Ventrone began his college career at Villanova University in 2001. As a junior in 2003, Ventrone was selected to the All-Atlantic 10 Conference first team. He finished his college career with 251 tackles, two sacks, and five forced fumbles. At Villanova, he was the hard-hitting safety who was often barred from making contact during practices to avoid injuring his teammates. Professional career=First stint with Patriots Although the Patriots considered picking Ventrone with the final pick of the 2005 NFL Draft, they chose tight end Andy Stokes as \\"Mr. Irrelevant\\"; Ventrone then signed as an undrafted free agent. Ventrone was released at the end of training camp and re-signed to the practice squad. After spending the rest of the 2005 season on the practice squad, he was allocated to NFL Europa in the spring of 2006. There, Ventrone suffered an injury and was placed on the team's NFL Europe/Non-Football Injury list, sidelining him for the 2006 season. New York Jets After the Patriots released Ventrone on February 13, 2007, he signed with the New York Jets on February 21; then-Jets head coach Eric Mangini had been Ventrone's defensive coordinator with the Patriots in 2005. After the Jets released Ventrone in their final cutdown before the 2007 season, they signed him to their practice squad, but released him on September 12. Second stint with Patriots Ventrone in 2009 training camp with the New England Patriots. The Patriots signed Ventrone to their practice squad on September 18, 2007 and then promoted to the team's 53-man roster on November 3. Upon the activation of Eddie Jackson and Chad Jackson from the PUP list, the Patriots released Ventrone on November 7, 2007, and re-signed him to their practice squad two days later. He was again promoted to the active roster in December, and remained on the active roster for the balance of the season, including Super Bowl XLII, in which he recorded his first NFL tackle. During the 2008 offseason, Ventrone began practicing as a wide receiver, a position he had not played in games since he was a sophomore at Chartiers Valley High School; he had, however, previously lined up at wide receiver on scout teams in Patriots practices. In the Patriots' third 2008 preseason game, Ventrone led all receivers with four receptions, while still playing on special teams and defense. Ventrone would go on to play in 15 games during the 2008 season, almost exclusively on special teams, recording six special teams tackles. During a July 31, 2009, press conference, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick spoke of Ventrone: Despite those comments, however, the Patriots released Ventrone during their final cutdowns on September 5, 2009. Cleveland Browns Ventrone signed with the Cleveland Browns on September 16, 2009. He was re-signed to a three-year, $2.2 million deal on March 6, 2010. Ventrone was selected as a Pro Bowl Alternate as a Special Teamer in 2010 where he led the #1 ranked special teams unit in the NFL. He was Special Teams Captain in 2011 and 2012. San Francisco 49ers Ventrone signed with the San Francisco 49ers on June 3, 2013, and served as a special teams captain for the 2013 and 2014 seasons; he was voted \\"Special Teams Player of the Year\\" by his teammates and coaches.  Coaching career  On March 3, 2015, the New England Patriots announced that they had hired Ray Ventrone as a special teams assistant coach. He fills the vacancy left after Scott O'Brien retired as Patriots' special teams coach, and assistant Joe Judge was named as O'Brien's replacement. His hire ended the Patriots' status as the only NFL team without a former player on its coaching staff. On February 5, 2017, Ventrone was part of the Patriots coaching staff that won Super Bowl LI. In the game, the Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons by a score of 34‚Äì28 in overtime. On February 15, 2018, Ventrone was announced as the special teams coach of the Indianapolis Colts.

When a character's hit points reach zero, they are removed from battle, but can be revived. Plot In the Kingdom of Carnava, in an age when magic supports everyday life and civilization itself, peace is maintained by the queen's knights and the Rev Magic Association. Sixteen years before the game's story begins, monsters called Beast Fiends start to appear, destroying everything in their way. Mattias, leader of the Magic Association, uses the evil Demon Blade to try to seal the source of the fiends, but is sealed away himself by the elemental witches. At the time of the game setting, new Beast Fiends have been appearing, and the government overextends its forces trying to protect the entire kingdom. Meanwhile, Fatimaa powerful witch of the Association with control of the rare Shadow Frost Magicgoes rogue and starts a conflict with the Association, causing more trouble for the Kingdom. Trying to solve the crisis, the kingdom starts a clandestine research project whose aim is to produce an easier way to use magic. The story starts when the kingdom has just successfully completed the research project, and devised a tool known as the \\"Runic Engine\\". Roland, a knight in training, is accidentally imbued with this new power, and fights the Beast Fiends, Master Mattias and the Shadow Frost Witch. In the course of the game, he discovers that the Rev Magic Association had covered up Mattias' turn to evil. However, he does not realise that Mattias did this to try and save the world, rather than destroy it. He later discovers that Bharva, king of the Fiends, was manipulating events, and joins with Fatima to prevent the Mage Queen Elicia, creator of the Fiends, from overrunning the world with them. The player has a choice of having a romantic relationship with Fatima or Althea, and end game parts of the story, including the ending, will change depending on the player's pre-battle dialogue choices. Development and release The game was featured at the Marvelous Entertainment booth at the Tokyo Game Show 2007. It was released in Japan on May 15, 2008 and North America on November 18, 2008.

Instead, composers Yoko Shimomura, Akari Kaida, Yoshino Aoki, and Shunsuke Tsuchiya wrote the soundtrack, while Mitsuda acted as sound producer. The game includes a bonus music CD insert. Those who preordered the game at selected retailers received an art book named \\"Luminous Art\\", which offers content from both Luminous Arc games. A manga based on the story of Luminous Arc 2 began serialization in 2008. Reception In Japan, Famitsu gave Luminous Arc 2 all four sevens for a total of 28 out of 40.

It is a locked room mystery and the final appearance in novel form of the series detective Sir Henry Merrivale and his long-time associate, Scotland Yard's Chief Inspector Humphrey Masters. Plot summary At Telford Old Hall, the past is a constant reminder in the present. Long-dead Cavalier Sir Byng Rawdon still haunts the house, and lately has been making his ghostly presence known, it seems. During his lifetime, he etched a poem into a leaded-glass window with a diamond that is a showpiece of the historic house, along with the heavily jeweled Cavalier's Cup, a family heirloom. When Sir Henry Merrivale and Chief Inspector Masters arrive to debunk the ghost, Masters agrees to spend the night in the Oak Room with the doors locked and windows latched. Masters falls asleep and, when he wakes up, he finds that the Cavalier's Cup has been moved from the locked safe and left standing on a nearby table. Also, Sir Byng's sword, which was hanging outside the Oak Room, has been placed at Masters' feet. Sir Henry and Masters must cope with Telford Old Hall's present-day inhabitants, a visiting American Congressman and Sir Henry's singing teacher in order to reveal who is behind the ghostly manifestations.

The motion picture is based on a story by Leo Marks, and Gerald Vaughan-Hughes wrote the screenplay.Sebastian - at Britmovie.co.uk.Sebastian - at IMDb Filmed in location in Oxford, London, Jodrell Bank and at Twickenham Film Studios, St Margarets, Twickenham, Middlesex, England, the film debuted in New York City, New York on 24 January 1968. Plot Mr. Sebastian is a former Oxford professor, who in the late 60s directs the all-female decoding office of British Intelligence. One day, while running through the streets of Oxford to attend the bestowing of an honorary degree on his friend the Prime Minister, Sebastian runs into Rebecca (Becky) Howard and her jeep. After insulting Sebastian on the spot, Becky is intrigued by him and follows him to the ceremony. After Becky is able to spell her own name backwards, he gives her a phone number to call if she wants an unspecified \\"job.\\" Becky calls the number, and after Sebastian's personal assistant Miss Elliott describes the job as being part of the \\"civil service,\\" Becky is turned off by the idea. Overcoming her concerns, she calls again, and after a successful interview, obtains a job deciphering codes used by secret agents and foreign spies. Once settled in her new job, Becky slowly starts to fall for the aloof Mr Sebastian. However, problems arise when Gen. John Phillips, Head of Security, accuses Sebastian's senior Jewish decoder Elsa Shahn of being a poor security risk, because of her left-wing Communist leanings. Sebastian convinces the Head of Intelligence to retain Shahn despite Phillips' objections, expressing how vital Shahn is to the decoding office and reaffirming that she enjoys his full confidence. Eventually, Becky and Sebastian engage in an affair, which upsets Sebastian's longtime girlfriend (and washed-up pop singer) Carol Fancy. Ultimately, Shahn betrays Sebastian's trust by providing recently decoded information to a left-wing political organisation. When confronted with the security breach by the Head of Intelligence and by Phillips' watchdog Jameson, Sebastian tenders his resignation and breaks up with Becky, thinking she was on to him. He leaves London and returns to his teaching position at Oxford University. Months later, Sebastian is visited at Oxford by the Head of Intelligence, who convinces Sebastian to return, temporarily, to the decoding office to help the Americans decipher some unidentified signals emanating from a Sputnik-type Russian spy satellite circling the earth. To prepare for this assignment, Sebastian visits a secret British eavesdropping installation, where he meets the American Ackerman (Donald Sutherland), who is working on the project. One day, while looking for Becky, who has also left the decoding department after Sebastian's resignation and break-up, Sebastian runs into Carol, who invites him to a party at her apartment \\"for old times sake\\". At the party, Sebastian is drugged with LSD and lured to the top of the building by Toby, who unknown to Sebastian, is both Carol's lover and a foreign agent. Just as the hallucinating Sebastian is about to jump off the building ledge to his death at Toby's insistence, he is saved by Gen. Phillips, who had been tailing both men, and Toby is arrested. Sebastian returns to the decoding office, and finds out where Becky lives. While visiting Becky, Sebastian discovers that he is the father of her newborn baby.

In his 12 March 1968 review, Chicago Sun Times critic Roger Ebert said [Sebastian] \\"is a movie that moves confidently in three directions, arriving nowhere with a splendid show of style.\\"Ebert, Roger. - \\"Sebastian\\". - RogerEbert.com - 12 March 1968. - Retrieved on 2008-05-12. Ebert feels the film starts as a thriller about code-cracking operations, then it becomes a love affair between Bogarde and York, then there is the leak to the left-wing activist group by Palmer, and \\"in spectacular and tender denouement,\\" Bogarde saves the free world by cracking the Soviet satellite code that resembles his baby's rattle noise. Renata Adler of the New York Times was similarly lukewarm, calling Sebastian \\"a medium saturation put-on ... one of the problems with this sort of movie is the enormous pressure that it puts on the audience to have a good time over almost nothing.\\" She concludes her review by writing, \\"If only people wouldn't try to spoof everything at once, but concentrate on doing a thought-out funny thing or two.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/1968/01/25/archives/sebastian-arrives.html Variety magazine had essentially the same problem, complaining that even though the central code-breaking material had \\"potent angles for a strong film, but, herein, story touches so many bases that it never really finds a definite concept.\\" https://variety.com/1967/film/reviews/sebastian-1200421569/ Even its star Dirk Bogarde called the film a \\"non-event\\" at the time of its release.Morley, Sheridan (1999).

Many of his statements have stirred controversy and several have been headline news in the United States, and elsewhere. Many of these comments have been made on his daily talk show, The 700 Club. Criticism of Robertson's faith healing In the 1970s and 1980s Robertson was a faith healer. James Randi devoted a chapter of his book The Faith Healers to criticizing Robertson's faith healing. Randi commented that \\"in 1986, soon after the full importance of the AIDS epidemic began to become evident, Robertson was attempting to cure it by proclaiming people cured after prayer.\\" Randi also noted, \\"Gerry Straub, a former associate of Pat Robertson and his television producer, pointed out in his book Salvation for Sale the astonishing fact that God seemed to time miracles to conform with standard television format,\\" and \\"God would stop speaking to Pat and stop healing exactly in time with the theme music.\\" Randi explained that \\"in 1979, it appeared to Robertson's staff that their boss had been taking lessons from Oral Roberts\\" and \\"proposed to film the Second Coming!\\". The project was eventually publicly dropped, but \\"budget allocations [CBN] are made for their development.\\" Efficacy of Robertson's prayers Robertson prayed to God to steer hurricanes away from his company's Virginia Beach, Virginia headquarters. He credited his prayers for steering the course of Hurricane Gloria in 1985. The storm instead hit the Mid-Atlantic states and New England, causing $900 million in damage and eight deaths. Calling non-Christians \\"termites\\" In an August 1986 New York magazine article Robertson is quoted saying, \\"It is interesting, that termites don't build things, and the great builders of our nation almost to a man have been Christians, because Christians have the desire to build something. He is motivated by love of man and God, so he builds. The people who have come into [our] institutions [today] are primarily termites. They are into destroying institutions that have been built by Christians, whether it is universities, governments, our own traditions, that we have ... The termites are in charge now, and that is not the way it ought to be, and the time has arrived for a godly fumigation.\\". First child conceived out of wedlock During Robertson's unsuccessful presidential bid in 1987, Robertson told a Wall Street Journal reporter that his wedding date was actually five months after the date he had always maintained. Reporters said that the actual wedding date meant that his first son was conceived out of wedlock and that Robertson had lied about the date of his marriage in an attempt to cover the truth up. While conceding the reports were accurate, Robertson said that begetting his son out of wedlock occurred before Jesus Christ had entered his life. Robertson denounced the media choosing to report on the issue as \\"outrageous\\" and \\"reprehensible.\\" Comments on other Christian denominations On January 14, 1991, on The 700 Club, Pat Robertson attacked a number of Protestant denominations when he declared: \\"You say you're supposed to be nice to the Episcopalians and the Presbyterians and the Methodists and this, that, and the other thing. Nonsense. I don't have to be nice to the spirit of the Antichrist.\\". Comments on Islam Robertson frequently denounces the religion of Islam and Muslim people. During a 1995 taping of The 700 Club, he called the religion a \\"Christian heresy\\".. During a September 19, 2002 episode of Fox News Channel's Hannity & Colmes, Robertson claimed that the Muslim prophet Muhammad was \\"an absolute wild-eyed fanatic ... a robber and a brigand.\\". On the July 14, 2005 broadcast of The 700 Club, he claimed that \\"Islam, at its core, teaches violence.\\"The 700 Club, July 14, 2005. On the March 13, 2006 broadcast of The 700 Club Robertson stated that Muslims want global domination and that the outpouring of rage elicited by cartoon drawings of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad \\"just shows the kind of people we're dealing with. These people are crazed fanatics, and I want to say it now: I believe it's motivated by demonic power. It is Satanic and it's time we recognize what we're dealing with.\\" He finished by stating \\"by the way, Islam is not a religion of peace.\\". The Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, slammed Robertson's comments as \\"grossly irresponsible\\". Lynn went on to say, \\"At a time when inter-religious tensions around the world are at an all-time high, Robertson seems determined to throw gasoline on the fire.\\"Americans United for Separation of Church and State: Americans United Deplores Tv Preacher Pat Robertson's Inflammatory Attack On Islam . March 13, 2006. On the September 25, 2006 broadcast of The 700 Club Robertson stated \\"It's amazing how the Muslims deal with history and the truth with violence. They don't understand what reasoned dialogue is ...\\"The 700 Club, September 25, 2006. On the November 9, 2009 edition of The 700 Club Robertson stated \\"Islam is a violent ‚Äì I was going to say, 'religion', but it's not a religion; it's a political system. It's a violent political system bent on the overthrow of the governments of the world, and world domination. That is the ultimate aim. And they talk about infidels and all this, but the truth is that's what the game is. So, you're dealing with a ‚Äì not a religion ‚Äì you're dealing with a political system. And I think we should treat it as such, and treat its adherents as such, as we would members of the Communist Party, or members of some fascist group.\\". Comments on Hinduism On March 23, 1995, Pat Robertson led a television program in which he attacked Hinduism, calling it \\"demonic\\". He said that they worship \\"idols\\" and \\"hundreds of millions of deities,\\" which \\"has put a nation in bondage to spiritual forces that have deceived many for thousands of years.\\" He spoke against the doctrines of karma and reincarnation. These and other remarks have been repudiated by some Hindus. Dr. Kusumita Pedersen, Director for the Project on Human Rights and Religion, commented that Robertson has employed \\"almost every negative image and clich√© that has been used about Hinduism since the 18th century.\\". In his book The New World Order, Robertson wrote: \\"When I said during my presidential bid that I would bring only Christians and Jews into the government, I hit a firestorm. 'What do you mean?' the media challenged me. 'You're not going to bring atheists into the government? How dare you maintain that those who believe in Christian values are better qualified to govern America than Hindus and Muslims?' My simple answer is, 'Yes, they are.'\\". David Cantor, Senior Research Analyst of the Anti-Defamation League, points out that such \\"religious tests for office are unconstitutional. It's not just a purely a religious statement. It's a political statement.\\" Feminism, homosexuality, abortion and liberalism Robertson is opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage. He has described feminism as a \\"socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians.\\"\\"Equal Rights Initiative in Iowa Attacked\\", The Washington Post, August 23, 1992. Many of Robertson's views mirror those of fellow evangelical activist pastor Jerry Falwell, who made frequent appearances on The 700 Club. He agreed with Falwell when Falwell stated that the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were caused by \\"pagans, abortionists, feminists, gays, lesbians, the American Civil Liberties Union and the People For the American Way.\\".. The June 8, 1998 edition of his show, where Robertson denounced Orlando, Florida and Disney World for allowing a privately sponsored \\"Gay Days\\" weekend, also drew criticism from Americans United for Separation of Church and State. Robertson stated that the acceptance of homosexuality could result in hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, terrorist bombings and \\"possibly a meteor,\\" prompting Americans United to criticize Robertson, saying it was \\"deplorable that Robertson is using the tragedy of these fires to promote his religious and political agenda.\\". The resulting outcry prompted Robertson to return to the topic on June 24, where he quoted the Book of Revelation to support his claims. The first hurricane of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season,. Hurricane Bonnie, actually turned away from Florida and instead damaged the rest of the East Coast. The area hardest hit by the hurricane was the Hampton Roads region,. which includes Virginia Beach,. the place of origin of Robertson's The 700 Club.. While other hurricanes did hit Florida, none of them hit Disney World.. While discussing the Mark Foley scandal on the October 5, 2006 broadcast of the show, Robertson condemned Foley, saying he \\"does what gay people do\\" and claiming that it would not hurt Republican chances in the elections, as \\"the church people understand forgiveness, they understand sin.\\"The 700 Club, October 5, 2006. Following the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges that legalized same-sex marriage in the United States, Robertson stated, on the June 29, 2015 episode of The 700 Club, in response to the ruling that, \\"You're gonna say that you like anal sex, you like oral sex, you like bestiality.\\" He went on to say, \\"Sooner or later, you're going to have to conform your religious beliefs to the group of some abhorrent thing. It won't stop at homosexuality.\\"  Comments on Scotland  In 1999, Bank of Scotland announced a joint venture with Robertson to establish banks in the United States that conduct all business by telephone, a business model that had been successful in the United Kingdom. Robertson said that the Church of Scotland and the Scottish Episcopal Church ignored the teachings of Saint Paul because they have ordained gays. Robertson also said that Scotland was \\"a dark land\\" overrun by gays. In response the Bank of Scotland dropped their plans for a business operation with Robertson, following customer complaints. In a press release, Robertson said that \\"media comments about him had made it impossible to proceed.\\" Financial ties to politicians An investigation by the Commonwealth of Virginia's Office of Consumer Affairs determined that Robertson \\"willfully induced contributions from the public through the use of misleading statements and other implications\\" and called for a criminal prosecution against Robertson in 1999. However, Virginia Attorney General Mark Earley, a Republican whose largest campaign contributor two years earlier was Robertson himself, intervened, accepting that Robertson had made deceptive appeals but overruling the recommendation for his prosecution.. Comments on Chinese abortions In a 2001 interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, he said that the Chinese were \\"doing what they have to do,\\" regarding China's one-child policy, sometimes enforced with compulsory abortions, though he said that he did not personally agree with the practice.. The statement drew criticisms from a variety of groups, including the Family Research Council, Traditional Values Coalition, and Concerned Women for America.. Racehorse ownership In April 2002, Robertson acknowledged buying a race horse, named \\"Mr. Pat\\", for $520,000. He told a New York Times reporter that his interest in the horse was based purely on its aesthetics. \\"I don't bet and I don't gamble. I just enjoy watching horses running and performing.\\" Christian scholar Martin Marty criticised this statement by Robertson, stating \\"The whole culture of horse racing involves gambling, and all the money comes from people trying to hit it big gambling. This is like saying you're investing in a bordello but aren't in favor of prostitution.\\" Financial ties to African leaders Robertson repeatedly supported former President of Liberia, Charles Taylor, in various episodes of his The 700 Club program during the United States' involvement in the Second Liberian Civil War in June and July 2003. Robertson accuses the U.S. State Department of giving President Bush bad advice in supporting Taylor's ouster as president, and of trying \\"as hard as they can to destabilize Liberia.\\". Robertson was criticized for failing to mention in his broadcasts his $8,000,000 (USD) investment in a Liberian gold mine.. Taylor had been indicted by the United Nations for war crimes at the time of Robertson's support, and was found guilty of crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, slavery and the use of child soldiers. Prosecutors also said that Taylor had harbored members of Al Qaeda responsible for the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. According to Robertson, the Liberian gold mine Freedom Gold was intended to help pay for humanitarian and evangelical efforts in Liberia, when in fact the company was allowed to fail leaving many debts both in Liberia and in the international mining service sector. Regarding this controversy, Richard Land, head of the Southern Baptist Convention's public policy said, \\"I would say that Pat Robertson is way out on his own, in a leaking life raft, on this one.\\". Operation Blessing Robertson has also been accused of using his tax-exempt, nonprofit organization, Operation Blessing International, as a front for his own financial gain, and then using his influence in the Republican Party to cover his tracks. After Robertson made emotional pleas in 1994 on The 700 Club for cash donations to Operation Blessing to support airlifts of refugees from Rwanda to Zaire, a reporter from The Virginian-Pilot stated that Operation Blessing's planes were transporting diamond-mining equipment for the Robertson-owned African Development Corporation, a venture Robertson had established in cooperation with Zaire's dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, whom Robertson had befriended earlier in 1993. According to Operation Blessing documents, Robertson personally owned the planes used for Operation Blessing airlifts. A documentary exploring the Operation Blessing controversies, entitled Mission Congo, premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. Robertson continues to state that Operation Blessing was largely responsible for providing aid to Rwanda following the 1994 genocide, even after an official investigation into Operation Blessing described it as a \\"fraudulent and deceptive\\" operation that provided almost no aid. According to The Guardian, all Operation Blessing volunteers did was recite Bible passages at dying refugees. Robertson was accused of taking credit for work that was actually done by M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res. On December 12, 2013, The Guardian issued an apology to Operation Blessing over false claims in the article \\"Mission Congo: how Pat Robertson raised millions on the back of a non- existent aid project\\" and agreed to make a contribution to Operation Blessing to be used in its relief efforts for victims of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. A 1999 report concluded that whilst Robertson's requests for donations to Operation Blessing had been misleading, they were not an intentional attempt to commit fraud. Comments on the US State Department On his The 700 Club television program, Pat Robertson has sharply criticized elements of the United States government and \\"special interest\\" groups that do not share his views. In October 2003 interviews with author Joel Mowbray about his book \\"Dangerous Diplomacy\\", a book critical of the United States Department of State, Robertson made suggestions that the explosion of a nuclear weapon at State Department Headquarters would be good for the country, and repeated those comments on the air. \\"What we need is for somebody to place a small nuke at Foggy Bottom.\\" Iraq War Pat Robertson claimed in 2004 that President Bush told him before he led the United States into the Iraq War, that he expected there to be no casualties. He made this claim in an interview with CNN, on October 19, 2004. President Bush's then-press secretary Scott McClellan denied the allegation. Mike McCurry, press secretary for Democratic Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, who was Bush's opponent for the presidency in the 2004 election, said that Bush deserved the benefit of the doubt, but he should say whether or not Robertson was telling the truth or lying. Comments on assassinating Hugo Ch√°vez On the August 22, 2005 broadcast of The 700 Club, Robertson said of Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez: Robertson also said that Ch√°vez was \\"going to make Venezuela a launching pad for communist infiltration and Muslim extremism all over the continent\\" and called the leader an \\"out-of-control dictator ... a dangerous enemy to our south, controlling a huge pool of oil that could hurt us very badly.\\". Assassinations of heads of state have been against U.S. policy since an executive order against them was issued in 1976; in response, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said that \\"our department doesn't do that kind of thing.\\" Bernardo √Ålvarez, Venezuela's ambassador to the U.S., demanded a stronger condemnation from the White House and that the United States \\"respect our country and its president.\\" On the August 24 edition of The 700 Club, Robertson asserted that he hadn't actually called for Ch√°vez's assassination, but that there were other ways of \\"taking him out\\", such as having special forces carry out a kidnapping. Robertson explicitly denied having used the word \\"assassination\\", though the word \\"assassinate\\" was present in his initial statement.The 700 Club, August 24, 2005. Later that day, he issued a written statement in which he said, \\"Is it right to call for assassination? No, and I apologize for that statement. I spoke in frustration that we should accommodate the man who thinks the U.S. is out to kill him\\". However, he continued to justify his original stance on the potential threat Ch√°vez posed to U.S. interests,. even reiterating his support for Chavez's assassination on the February 2, 2006 edition of Hannity and Colmes, replying \\"[N]ot now, but one day, one day, one day,\\" when asked whether Robertson wanted Chavez taken out.. On Sunday, August 28, 2005, Ch√°vez called on the U.S. Justice Department to investigate the matter: \\"My government is going to take legal action in the United States,\\" he said in a televised speech. \\"If the U.S. government does not take the necessary steps, we will denounce the U.S. government at the United Nations and the Organization of American States\\".. Attributing statement to Barry W. Lynn On the November 5, 2005 airing of The 700 Club, Robertson claimed that Reverend Barry W. Lynn, director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said that \\"if a church is burning down, the local community could not send the fire engine to put the fire out because that would violate, quote, separation of church and state.\\"The 700 Club, November 5, 2005. Rev. Lynn responded, denying the allegation and saying \\"I've seen [Robertson] take pot shots at me with information I have repeatedly told them is not true. Robertson, for example, continues to tell national television audiences that I believe that a public fire department can't go to a burning church without violating the separation of church and state. He apparently uses this \\"anecdote\\" to demonstrate my radical, wacky beliefs. Trouble is (for him), I never said it and don't believe it.\\". Robertson also drew criticism from Focus on the Family for the statement in their magazine, Citizen, saying that \\"One Christian conservative leader [presumably Robertson] has mistakenly suggested that Lynn would say a burning church shouldn't be able to call the fire department lest it violate the bounds of church-state separation.\\". Comments on Dover, Pennsylvania On his November 10, 2005 broadcast of The 700 Club, Robertson told citizens of Dover, Pennsylvania that they had rejected God by voting out of office all seven members of the school board who support intelligent design. \\"I'd like to say to the good citizens of Dover: if there is a disaster in your area, don't turn to God, you just rejected him from your city\\", Robertson said on his broadcast. \\"And don't wonder why he hasn't helped you when problems begin, if they begin. I'm not saying they will, but if they do, just remember, you just voted God out of your city. And if that's the case, don't ask for his help because he might not be there.\\". In a written statement, Robertson later clarified his comments: \\"God is tolerant and loving, but we can't keep sticking our finger in his eye forever. If they have future problems in Dover, I recommend they call on Charles Darwin. Maybe he can help them.\\". Comments on Ariel Sharon's health The lead story on the January 5, 2006, edition of The 700 Club was Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's hospitalization for a severe stroke. After the story, Robertson said that Sharon's illness was possibly retribution from God for his recent drive to give more land to the Palestinians. He also claimed former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin's 1995 assassination may have occurred for the same reason.. The remarks drew criticism from all sides, even from other evangelicals. For instance, Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, said that Robertson \\"ought to know better\\" than to say such things. He added, \\"...the arrogance of the statement shocks me almost as much as the insensitivity of it.\\". Ted Haggard, then president of the National Association of Evangelicals, said that \\"any doctor could have predicted (Sharon's) going to have health problems\\" and that his illness was medical, not divine retribution.. The White House called Robertson's statement \\"wholly inappropriate and offensive\\".. Robertson was also chastised by Israeli officials and members of the Anti- Defamation League.. On January 11, Israel responded by announcing that Robertson would be banned from involvement in a project to build a Christian tourist attraction and pilgrimage site near the Sea of Galilee known as the Christian Heritage Center. The plan had called for Israel leasing of land to a group of evangelicals (including Robertson) for free to create several tourist attractions and pilgrimage sites in exchange for the evangelicals raising 50 million dollars in funding. A spokesman for the Tourism Ministry commented, \\"We cannot accept these statements, and we will not sign any contracts with Mr. Robertson.\\". He added that the decision would not apply to all members of the evangelical community: \\"We want to see who in the group supports his (Robertson's) statements. Those who support the statements cannot do business with us. Those that publicly support Ariel Sharon's recovery ... are welcome to do business with us.\\". On January 12, Robertson sent a letter to Sharon's son Omri, apologizing for his comments. In the letter, Robertson called Ariel Sharon a \\"kind, gracious and gentle man\\" who was \\"carrying an almost insurmountable burden of making decisions for his nation.\\" He added that his \\"concern for the future safety of your nation led me to make remarks which I can now view in retrospect as inappropriate and insensitive in light of a national grief experienced because of your father's illness ... I ask your forgiveness and the forgiveness of the people of Israel.\\". Omri and the Israeli government accepted the apology, though it remained unclear whether the deal with Robertson would be rehabilitated.... While some observers were satisfied by the gesture, some reporters also accused Robertson of using the apology as a tactic allowing him to make such statements while promoting a public image among evangelicals as a leader who does not compromise on his values. Surprisingly, some of the harsher criticism of Robertson did not come from American or Israeli Jews, but from his fellow evangelicals and conservative Christians, who charged that Robertson's behavior did serious harm to evangelicals' image, and led to unfair generalizations and criticism of them.. The fallout from Robertson's comments was still visible over a month after the event; after speaking with organizers of the National Religious Broadcasters February 2006 convention, Robertson wound up cancelling his planned keynote speech. A representative from Israel's Tourism Ministry diplomatically commented, \\"Pat Robertson has been a long-term friend of the state of Israel, and continues to be so.\\". In March 2006, Robertson lost a bid for re-election to the board of directors of the National Religious Broadcasters.. Comments about \\"liberal professors\\" On the March 21, 2006 broadcast of The 700 Club, while reviewing The Professors: The 101 Most Dangerous Academics in America by David Horowitz, the subject of which is radical academics in American universities, Robertson went on to say that the 101 professors named in the book are only but a few of \\"thirty to forty thousand\\" left-wing professors in the United States, all of whom he accused of being \\"racists, murderers, sexual deviants and supporters of Al-Qaeda,\\" further labeling them as \\"termites that have worked into the woodwork of our academic society.\\" Later in the broadcast, he went on to say, \\"these guys are out and out communists, they are radicals, they are, you know, some of them killers, and they are propagandists of the first order ... you don't want your child to be brainwashed by these radicals, you just don't want it to happen. Not only brainwashed but also beat up, they beat these people up, cower them into submission.\\"The 700 Club, March 21, 2006.  Leg press claims In May 2006 Robertson began claiming on his web site that through training and his \\"Age-Defying energy shake\\", he is able to leg press while others claim he is a liar, pushing a common energy formula.. Two thousand pounds would be an exceptional accomplishment for a world-class athlete, to say nothing of Robertson, then in his seventies. For comparative purposes, when Dan Kendra set the Florida State University record of , the leg press machine required extensive modifications to hold the proper amount of weight, and the capillaries in both of Kendra's eyes burst during his successful attempt. Thus, Robertson's claimed achievement would add to the best-ever total of Kendra, a top athlete in his physical prime, who later played in the National Football League and tried unsuccessfully to become a Navy SEAL. In response to the skepticism about this claim, Robertson's website has claimed that his doctor is able to leg press , and that \\"It is not nearly as hard as the authors of these reports make it out to be.\\". A video has also been provided supposedly demonstrating Robertson doing several reps with a weight of . In the video Pat Robertson is seen using a 45-degree sled-type leg press machine, which reduces the effective weight to (sin(45¬∞) x 1000 lbs [454 kg]). He keeps the safety locks in place at the second step, which severely limits the range of possible motion. The seat is positioned to allow approximately six inches of travel after the lock. This setup gives Pat Robertson the maximum mechanical advantage at the last few inches of travel. In contrast, actual leg press technique is allowing the weight to slide down until the hip and knee joints are at significant flexion.: technique discussed and illustrated ‚Äî includes animation of correct leg press being performed. The video of Roberson's lift has also been criticized because it does not appear to verify his claim that he's lifting . Mike DeBonis of Slate noted \\"It appears as if 16 plates are loaded on the machine. Four of them look like 100-pound [45 kg] plates, and the rest are 45s [20 kg]. That adds up to 940 pounds [425 kg].\\" DeBonis also noted that Robertson is using incorrect form as he \\"helps his legs by pushing on his knees with his arms. That's a no-no. He also achieves nowhere near the recommended full range of motion, which is to bring the knees to at least a 90-degree angle.\\" DeBonis saw the claims made by Robertson and similar claims by Madeleine Albright (that she can press ) as yet another proof of the inferiority of that particular machine in comparison to the barbell squat, \\"Most leg press machines are constructed as either a sled angled at 45 degrees or a lever. (There are some that use cables, too.) In all cases, some of the weight gets borne by the machine. You may be loading 400 pounds [180 kg], but your muscles are feeling only 200 [90 kg].\\" The video has since been removed from the CBN website. Robertson responded to questions concerning the lift in an interview with CBS. He maintained his claim to have done it but admitted \\"I didn't do it with the same form that these professional bodybuilders do, which is a full squat, and it's very difficult. But I did do it. I regularly can do 1,000 pounds [454 kg] and 1,200 pounds [544 kg].\\" He said he used an incline leg press and did \\"the full extension on that particular machine. They have a brake on it. I was told put the brake on. When the professionals do it, they take the brake off and let the weight come all the way down on them. And if you don't have a lot of help, you've got a Volkswagen sitting on your hips. I didn't do that.\\" In June 2006, General Nutrition Center, a nutritional supplement retailer, announced without explanation that it would stop carrying Robertson's energy drink.. Racist comments about Asian appearance On the February 7, 2007 edition of The 700 Club, Robertson stated that people who have too much plastic surgery \\"got the eyes like they're Oriental\\" and stretched his eyelids in a manner stereotypical of Asians.. 2010 Haiti earthquake On the January 13, 2010 broadcast of The 700 Club, Robertson blamed the Haitians for making a deal with the Devil during their 1791 slave rebellion, resulting in the Haiti earthquake of January 12, 2010 and other misfortunes. He told viewers of his Christian Broadcasting Network: He went on to state: The reference to a \\"pact to the devil\\" was later said by CBN to be a reference to the Vodou ceremony conducted by Dutty Boukman involving animal sacrifice in Bois Ca√Øman that began the Haitian revolution. Contrary to Robertson's claims however, this ceremony and the religion of Vodou in general does not involve Satan or devil worship.. Robertson mistakenly identified the French government as that of Napoleon III, as Haiti became independent (and the Revolution won) four years before Napoleon III was born. In fact, it was Napoleon Bonaparte (by far, the more famous of the two rulers), who sent a French army to try to recapture Haiti a decade after its revolution. The force was destroyed by yellow fever and the fierce resistance led by Haitian generals. Veteran Christian radio broadcaster Michael Ireland stated that this Haitian Vodou ceremony has long been erroneously referenced by various self-assoiling Christian sources as the \\"pact with the devil\\" or \\"pact to the devil\\" that began the Haitian revolution. This Vodou ceremony was a ceremonial impulsion to the liberation of thousands of abjectly enslaved peoples under French, mostly Christian, tyranny: and as such has been perverted over the following decades to besmear a righteous liberty-struggle as formed of wicked means. These Christians were influenced by spiritual warfare theology and concerned that the Aristide government had made efforts to incorporate the Vodou sector more fully into the political process. These Evangelicals developed a counter-narrative to the official national story. In this narrative, the ancestral spirits at the Vodou cemetery were re-cast as demons. In their view, the engagement with demons amounted to a pact that put Haiti under the rule of Satan. While some Haitian Evangelicals subscribe to this idea, most Haitian nationalists vehemently oppose it. According to Gothenburg University researcher Markel Thylefors, \\"The event of the Bois Ca√Øman ceremony forms an important part of Haitian national identity as it relates to the very genesis of Haiti.\\" In his daily press briefing on January 14, 2010, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said of Robertson's commentary: \\"It never ceases to amaze that in times of amazing human suffering somebody says something that could be so utterly stupid.\\" Mainline and evangelical Christian voices appeared mostly unanimous in criticizing Robertson's remarks as untrue, untimely and insensitive. Comments on marijuana laws On the December 16, 2010 broadcast of The 700 Club Pat Robertson condemned harsh sentences for people convicted of possession of cannabis. Robertson stated, \\"We're locking up people that take a couple of puffs of marijuana, and the next thing you know they've got 10 years.\\" He went on to say, \\"I'm not exactly for the use of drugs ‚Äì don't get me wrong ‚Äì but I just believe that criminalizing marijuana, criminalizing the possession of a few ounces of pot and that kind of thing, I mean, it's just costing us a fortune and it's ruining young people.\\" Robertson's remarks were applauded by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws and the Drug Policy Alliance. Executive Director of the Drug Policy Alliance Ethan Nadelmann said, \\"The people who are listening to him may roll their eyes when the Democrats say this, but when Pat Robertson says this he has credibility in the faith community.\\" Appearing on Good Morning America, Vice President Joe Biden condemned Robertson's commentary, saying, \\"I still believe it's a gateway drug. I've spent a lot of my life as chairman of the Judiciary Committee dealing with this. I think it would be a mistake to legalize.\\" Comments advocating divorce On the September 14, 2011, broadcast of The 700 Club, a viewer talked about a friend who was bitter at God because his wife had Alzheimer's disease, and the friend had started seeing another woman. The viewer asked Robertson for his advice. Robertson responded, \\"I know it sounds cruel, but if he's going to do something, he should divorce her and start all over again, but make sure she has custodial care and somebody looking after her.\\" He continued saying, \\"If you respect that vow, you say 'til death do us part. This is a kind of death.\\" In response, Russell D. Moore, Dean of the School of Theology at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, wrote that Robertson's comments were \\"a repudiation of the gospel of Jesus Christ\\" and that \\"Pat Robertson's cruel marriage statement is no anomaly. He and his cohorts have given us for years a prosperity gospel with more in common with an Asherah pole than a cross.\\" Following a backlash over Robertson's advice, Robertson said, \\"Basically I'm saying, adultery is not a good thing and you might as well straighten your life out and the only way to do it is to kind of get your affair with your wife in order. ... I was not giving advice to the whole world and nor was I counseling anybody to be unscriptural and leave their spouse. ... Please know that I believe the Bible. Please know that I never would tell anybody to leave their sick spouse. I never never would say such a thing because I need my spouse when I get sick and she needs me when she gets sick. In sickness and in health, I believe it!\\" Comments on spousal abuse Robertson was criticized in September 2012 after a man named Michael called The 700 Club asking for advice on what to do about his wife not respecting him. Robertson called the woman a \\"rebellious child\\" who did not want to \\"submit to any authority.\\" He jokingly suggested that Michael become a Muslim and move to Saudi Arabia where he could beat her. Critics noted that Robertson's comments about wife-beating were edited out of the episode when it appeared on the Christian Broadcasting Network. Comments on Young Earth creationism In November 2012, a viewer of The 700 Club wrote that one of her biggest fears was that her children and husband would not go to heaven \\"because they question why the Bible could not explain the existence of dinosaurs.\\" Before answering the question, Robertson acknowledged the statement was controversial by saying, \\"I know that people will probably try to lynch me when I say this.\\" He then replied: \\"You go back in time, you've got radiocarbon dating. You got all these things, and you've got the carcasses of dinosaurs frozen in time out in the Dakotas. They're out there. So, there was a time when these giant reptiles were on the Earth, and it was before the time of the Bible. So, don't try and cover it up and make like everything was 6,000 years. That's not the Bible. If you fight science, you're going to lose your children, and I believe in telling them the way it was.\\" Young Earth creationist and director of Answers in Genesis, Ken Ham responded to Robertson's commentary by saying: \\"Not only do we have to work hard to not let our kids be led astray by the anti-God teaching of the secularists, we have to work hard to not let them be led astray by compromising church leaders like Pat Robertson. Pat Robertson gives more fodder to our enemies.\\" Ham said, referring to secularists and atheists who applauded Robertson online for his statements. He went on to say that, \\"Such leaders ‚Äî including Pat Robertson ‚Äî have a lot to answer to the Lord for one day, such leaders are guilty of putting stumbling blocks in the way of kids and adults in regards to believing God's word and the Gospel.\\" In May 2014, Robertson responded to a caller regarding the age of the earth: \\"You have to be deaf, dumb and blind to think that this Earth that we live in only has 6,000 years of existence, it just doesn't, I'm sorry ... To deny the clear record that's there before us makes us looks silly ... There's no way that all this that you have here took place in 6,000 years, it just couldn't have been done, couldn't possibly have been done.\\" Once again, Ham vociferously criticized Robertson's remarks saying: \\"Pat Robertson illustrates one of the biggest problems we have today in the church-people like Robertson compromise the Word of God with the pagan ideas of fallible men!\\" Ham went on to say: \\"Pat Robertson is not upholding the Word of God with his ridiculous statements -- he is undermining the authority of the Word.\\" Comments on AIDS On the August 27, 2013 episode of The 700 Club, Robertson said that members of the San Francisco gay community would deliberately infect people with AIDS by cutting them with a sharp, infected ring while shaking hands. The comment was edited out when the clip was posted online, but as of September 5, 2013 the video was available from other outlets. He also said that the homosexual community had put laws on the books prohibiting people from mentioning their HIV status.. During the October 16, 2014 episode of The 700 Club, a viewer sent in an email saying she had been called by God to go on a mission trip to Kenya but friends and family had expressed fears that she could catch Ebola in Kenya. In his answer, Robertson pointed out that there was not currently an outbreak of Ebola in Kenya, but warned of the risk of AIDS, stating: \\"You might get AIDS in Kenya, people have AIDS, you've got to be careful. I mean, the towels could have AIDS.\\" Health experts subsequently stated that towels cannot have AIDS. The comment angered viewers in Kenya who took to Twitter to express their disapproval using the hashtag someonetellPatRobertson. The show later apologized. Comments on US- Saudi Arabia relations after the death of Jamal Khashoggi Robertson received criticism after stating that \\"we've got an arms deal that everybody wanted a piece of ... it'll be a lot of jobs, a lot of money come to our coffers. It's not something you want to blow up willy-nilly\\" in the wake of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.

The park surrounds Lums Pond, an impoundment built by the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal on St. Georges Creek. The C&D; built the pond as a source of water to fill the locks of the canal that connected the Chesapeake Bay with the Delaware River during the early 19th century. Lums Pond State Park is open for a wide variety of year-round recreation. History Lums Pond, the largest freshwater pond in Delaware, covering in central New Castle County, was built in the early 19th century as an impoundment for the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. The pond supplied water to fill the locks of the canal and water power for a local gristmill. The pond became a natural recreational draw for the residents of Delaware. Ownership was transferred to the state of Delaware in the mid-20th century. Lums Pond State Park was opened to the public in 1963. The Lum's Mill House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Recreation Lums Pond is the center of recreation at Lums Pond State Park. Although swimming is not permitted in the pond, it is open to boating and fishing. Rowboats, sailboats, kayaks, canoes, and pedalos are available to rent. Lums Pond is a freshwater fishery with the common game fish being carp, pickerel, crappie, catfish, and largemouth bass and hybrid striped bass. The hybrid striped bass are stocked by the Fish and Wildlife Division of the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control. The other game fish are native species. Many visitors to Lums Pond State Park take advantage of the wide variety of camping opportunities that are available. There 62 campsites without electric connections, six sites with electricity, two yurts, and four sites with stabling facilities for horses. The campsites are open to RVs or tents. The yurts feature bunk beds and a futon, electricity, and a large outdoor deck with freshwater and a grill. The Whale Wallow Nature Center is open seasonally.

Merrie Melodies short directed by Bob Clampett. The short was released on July 28, 1945, and stars Porky Pig. The cartoon is a color remake of the 1938 Looney Tunes black-and-white short Injun Trouble. All voices except narration and Sloppy Moe are performed by Mel Blanc, whose screen credit is his first in a non-Bugs Bunny cartoon. In addition to the usual Native American stereotype music, Carl Stalling's underscore frequently plays segments of the American Civil War tune, \\"Kingdom Coming\\", even converting it to a minor key in one segment. \\"Oh! Susanna\\" is also heard repeatedly in the underscore. The cartoon has been criticized for its stereotypical and insensitive depictions of Native Americans. Plot The cartoon opens in 1849, with narration by Robert C. Bruce, over a spurious map showing a sliver of land on the Eastern Seaboard labeled \\"USA\\", with all land to its west labeled \\"INJUN JOE'S TERRITORY\\". Porky Pig is leading a wagon train to California and he must keep an eye out for the Herculean Native American \\"Super Chief\\", Injun Joe. The name is a play on the famous Santa Fe train run of the same name (a frequent reference in WB cartoons), and reinforced by each character spouting smoke and crying \\"Woo-woo!\\" like a steam locomotive, each time they say Injun Joe's name. It is also a nod to an antagonistic literary character from Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Porky and Injun Joe are repeatedly interrupted by a goofy bearded hillbilly named Sloppy Moe (a play on \\"Sloppy Joe\\"), who keeps repeating, \\"I know something I won't tell, I won't tell, I won't tell!\\" to the tune of London Bridge is Falling Down. This goes on until Injun Joe corners Porky with tomahawk in hand, and Sloppy Moe sings his refrain once more. Injun Joe grabs him and demands, \\"What you know, Huh???\\", and Sloppy reveals his secret at last, \\"Injun... Joe... is... ticklish!\\", and proceeds to prove that by tickling the chief with his hands and beard. The Native American goes into a raucous laughing fit. Distracted, he backs off a cliff and falls deep into the ground, pulling the surface down with him, and causing the map seen at the beginning of the cartoon to stretch the \\"USA\\" sliver across to the west coast, so that it now reads \\"UNITED STATES of AMERICA\\" from west to east. The cartoon closes with the narrator returning to lionize the cartoon's heroes, Porky and Sloppy Moe, and irises-out with Moe tickling the giggling Porky.

He was later an organizer for the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). He worked against the Third Reich, plotted an assassination of Hitler in 1934 and was executed by the Nazi regime.  Biography  R√∂mer was born in Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria. An officer during World War I, the colorful and charismatic R√∂mer became a popular figure in the army, ending the war as a Captain. After the war, R√∂mer naturally emerged as a Freikorps leader becoming the founder, along with and Ludwig Horadam, of Bund Oberland, the largest and most significant of the Bavarian Freikorps. Oberland was instrumental in crushing the Bavarian Soviet Republic in April 1919, fought against the Ruhr workers in March and April 1920, and was a critical factor at the battle of Annaberg which drove the Poles from Upper Silesia in 1921 during the Silesian Uprisings. By this time, however, R√∂mer was already in contact with the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and, when called upon to break a strike in the Silesian city of Ratibor in mid 1921, the leaders of Oberland refused to undertake the task. By 1921 there were a number of patriotic groups in Bavaria clamoring for a restoration of the monarchy under Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria and talk of forming a break away Confederation of the Danube. Bund Oberland was against such a position and sought ways to thwart the monarchists. It appears that R√∂mer devised a plan to harness the energies of radical workers. To do this he contacted his childhood friend Otto Graf, KPD representative in the Bavarian parliament, and channeled some 350,000 marks in financial support to the KPD from Bund Oberland. In August 1922 during the course of an internal political struggle between Dr. Friedrich Weber's faction, which sympathized with the Nazis, and that of the original leaders, Horadam and R√∂mer, which were more left-leaning, R√∂mer was accused of embezzling Oberland funds to aid his friend Graf and the KPD. R√∂mer was expelled from Bund Oberland on 15 March 1923. With the general disbanding of the Freikorps in the early twenties, R√∂mer returned to school, receiving a law degree in 1922. Soon thereafter R√∂mer began to write for the KPD periodical Aufbruch (New Start) and, after joining the KPD in 1932, he became editor in chief.Hans Coppi, Jr. and Susanne R√∂mer. Aufbruch - Dokumentation einer Zeitschrift zwischen den Fronten. Reprint with preface by . Commentary by Hans Coppi. Koblenz (2001) R√∂mer opposed the Nazi regime right from the start and, as early as 1934, actively participated in plans to assassinate Hitler with Nikolaus von Halem, which led to his arrest and imprisonment in the Dachau concentration camp until 1939. Upon his release, R√∂mer immediately became involved with the worker‚Äôs opposition, publishing a bulletin for the resistance, Informationsdienst (Information Service), creating a network of opposition workplace cells, and again laying plans for an assassination attempt on Hitler. These cells were later infiltrated by the Gestapo and R√∂mer was arrested in February 1942 for activities related to abetting the enemy and corruption of military readiness. R√∂mer was sentenced to death on 16 June 1944 and executed on 25 September of that year at Brandenburg-G√∂rden Prison in Brandenburg an der Havel.

It was created when the Aberdeen Railway amalgamated with the Scottish Midland Junction Railway on 29 July 1856. It did not remain independent for long, for it was itself absorbed by the Caledonian Railway on 10 August 1866. Much of its network closed in 1967 when the former North British Railway route to Aberdeen via Dundee became the main route. Constituents=Early authorisations System map of the Scottish North Eastern Railway in 1866There was a frenzy of railway promotions in Scotland in 1845; there had been widespread controversy over a route from central Scotland to England, where a railway network was forming, and the public discussion encouraged thought of Scottish routes too. On 31 July 1845 the Caledonian Railway was authorised, with the then enormous capital of ¬£1,500,000, to build from Glasgow and Edinburgh to Carlisle. On the same day the Scottish Central Railway, the Dundee and Perth Railway, the Aberdeen Railway and the Scottish Midland Junction Railway were authorised. The SCR was to build from Castlecary (forming a connection with the Caledonian and the already existing Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway to Perth; the Aberdeen Railway was to build from Guthrie, near Arbroath, to Aberdeen, with branches to Montrose and Brechin; and it was to lease the Arbroath and Forfar Railway, a local stone block sleeper line. The SMJR was to link Perth and Forfar. Together the three railways would connect central Scotland to Perth, Forfar and Aberdeen, and with the Caledonian and its allies they would link to London as well. Even before authorisation the Caledonian had strategic plans to control these, and other, lines, forming a widespread Caledonian area of control in Scotland. As its capital would all be required to build its railway, it was unable to purchase the lines; instead it agreed leases of the other (as yet unauthorised) companies; this required no cash down payment, but a heavy commitment to periodical lease charges later. In due course, the Caledonian was to find that these payments were unaffordable, and it was able to escape them by demonstrating that they were ultra vires, that is, that their company had no powers to make such commitments. Moreover, Parliament was at times hostile to large combinations of lines, and declined to assent to some amalgamations. Quite apart from this dubious outcome, relations between the companies were not always amicable, and in fact the Scottish Central Railway was robustly independent for some years. However the Aberdeen Railway and the SMJR remained in a \\"loose association\\" with the Caledonian.John Thomas and David Turnock, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 15, North of Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1989, David Ross, The Caledonian: Scotland's Imperial Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, The Aberdeen Railway The Aberdeen Railway built its line from a triangular junction near Guthrie and Friockheim, not far from Arbroath, northwards to Aberdeen. It leased the Arbroath and Forfar Railway, on the basis that the A&FR; would upgrade its track. It had been built as a stone block sleeper line on the local track gauge of 5 ft 6in (1,372 mm) and the Aberdeen Railway seems not to have fully understood the financial implications of converting this to a modern double track main line on the standard gauge. The A&FR; had very little money to pay for the conversion itself. (The A&FR; company continued to exist until 1923 as a financial shell only, receiving the lease payment from the lessees.)Niall Ferguson, The Arbroath & Forfar Railway, the Dundee Direct Line and the Kirriemuir Branch, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2000, The Aberdeen company ran into financial difficulties of its own, running out of cash in 1848 after building from Guthrie to Dubton, with branches to Brechin and Montrose. After appealing for help from larger railways, it decided it did not care for the terms of any offer to help, and issued preference shares to its own shareholders (in modern parlance a rights issue). It managed to build to Ferryhill, a temporary terminus on the southern edge of Aberdeen, opening in 1850. Now the Burgh objected to plans the railway thought had been agreed, to take the line into the city, but after much negotiation the line was extended to a terminus called Guild Street in Aberdeen, opening in 1854. The Scottish Midland Junction Railway The SMJR built from Perth to Forfar, then an important medium-sized town, but the objective was to connect with other lines. Running through the fertile area of Strathmore, the SMJR adopted two local moribund lines, the Newtyle and Coupar Angus Railway and the Newtyle and Glammiss Railway. (Glammis is spelt Glamis nowadays.) Both of these were stone block sleeper single lines built to another local track gauge, this time 4 ft 6.5in (1,384 mm). These too needed to be modernised, the gauge altered, and the track made double. The SMJR started its line immediately north of Perth station, where the Scottish Central railway was building what became the joint station Perth General. It ran to Forfar, joining the Arbroath and Forfar line just after Forfar station. The line opened in 1848. The SMJR built a branch line to Blairgowrie, which opened in 1855. The Dundee and Arbroath Railway The Dundee and Arbroath Railway had opened in 1838. Never intended to be part of a wider network, it adopted the track gauge of 5 ft 6in (1,372 mm) and used stone block sleeper track, like the Arbroath and Forfar line. At first there was no physical link with the A&FR;, or any other line. In 1846 the D&AR; had obtained powers to build an extension at Arbroath to link with the A&FR;, and to convert its own track gauge to standard; this was in use from 1848. There were differences of priority between the SMJR and the D&AR; which led to some traffic from Aberdeen to Dundee being routed via Newtyle; this involved a transshipment of goods there (and a change of train for passengers) as the Dundee and Newtyle line still had its unique track gauge, and three rope-worked inclines.Peter Marshall, The Railways of Dundee, Oakwood Press, Headington, 1996, W A C Smith and Paul Anderson, An Illustrated History of Tayside's Railway, Dundee and Perth, Irwell Press, Clophill, 1997, The SNER in action From 29 July 1856 the SNER operated a railway from Perth to Aberdeen, with branches to Blairgowrie, Brechin and Montrose, as well as the stub to Newtyle, which connected with the Dundee and Newtyle Railway. The antipathy with the D&AR; was done away with, and Dundee traffic was now regularly routed via Arbroath. While the main line between Perth and Aberdeen was the highlight, there was much intermediate traffic at this date, chiefly agricultural. At Perth the SNER used the General station build and managed by the Scottish Central Railway. The station was increasingly becoming a traffic hub, and by Act of Parliament it was transferred to the control of a Joint Committee, representing all the users. This took effect on 8 August 1859. The approach lines, both north and south of the station, belonged to the SCR, and the SNER was charged the equivalent of six miles running for the use of 320 yards of line on the northern approach. The SNER objected to this and when negotiation failed to produce a result, the SNER established a temporary platform just north of the SCR lines; the station was called Perth, Glasgow Road. SNER trains from the north terminated there and connecting passengers had to make their own way through the streets to the main stations. The dispute lasted a few weeks until an arbitrator allowed the SNER to use the tracks for an annual payment of ¬£100. In 1862 the SNER purchased the Dundee and Arbroath line. Connecting to the Great North of Scotland Railway The Scottish Northern Junction Railway proposed routeThe Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) had a terminal at Waterloo, in Aberdeen, since 1855 (goods) and 1856 (passengers). This was some distance from the Aberdeen Railway (now SNER) Guild Street station. GNoSR traffic to the south, principally live cattle, was mostly forwarded by coastal shipping and through passengers simply had to walk between the two stations. They were 700 yards (640 m) apart. Both railways had connections to the harbour quayside but locomotive operation was prohibited on the harbour sidings. Although the GNoSR authorising Act had stipulated the construction of a line through the Denburn Valley to link with then former Aberdeen Railway, the GNoSR made it plain that it was content with the status quo, although local people and northern farmers were not. In 1862 a new company was promoted, the Scottish Northern Junction Railway (SNJR), to by- pass Aberdeen by building a new railway from Limpet Mill, near Stonehaven, to Kintore, on the GNoSR system. The scheme was highly attractive to the SNER as it would bring it much traffic that was denied to it; equally the GNoSR was dismayed at the possibility of losing income diverted away from it. The SNJR was authorised by Parliament in 1862 (25 & 26 Victoria, cap lxxix), and it was heavily supported by the SNER. It was to cross the Deeside Railway at Peterculter and make two short branches connecting to it there, which would give the line access to Aberdeen in addition. The SNJR, costing ¬£150,000 would have difficult gradients and curves, and would by-pass Aberdeen, the most important settlement in the area, and it was obvious that a 22-mile (35 km) railway was not the most effective means of connecting the north of Scotland into the railway network, and the GNoSR was successful in inserting a clause into the SNJR Act stipulating that if it obtained authority for a link line in Aberdeen in the next Parliamentary session, the SNJR authorisation would be suspended. At this time Aberdeen was heavily built up, and the GNoSR quickly developed a scheme that would run in a wide loop round the western margin of the city, entering the SNER Guild Street station from the south. Nonetheless it would have required significant demolitions of residential buildings, and, costing ¬£125,000 for less than three miles (5 km) of route, it attracted considerable hostility locally; its circuitous alignment brought it the mocking epithet \\"Circumbendibus\\". It was made a Parliamentary Bill, the Great North of Scotland Railway (Aberdeen Junction Railway) Bill in 1863. The Circumbendibus line and the Denburn Valley routeIn Parliamentary committee the objections were so significant that the promoters agreed that a previous proposal, the Denburn Valley Railway should be substituted, the capital of the GNoSR scheme and of the SNJR being combined for the purpose, amounting to ¬£200,000. The Denburn Valley line would run directly from Kittybrewster on the GNoSR to a junction with the SNER near Guild Street; a new central Joint Station (to be managed by a Joint Committee) would be built, and the portion of line north and south of the station would be allocated respectively to the GNoSR and the SNER. The Denburn Valley Railway Act was passed in 1864 \\"to remove the inconvenience arising from the non-construction of the Portion of the Great North of Scotland Railway through the Denburn Valley in Aberdeen which was originally authorised as Part of that Railway\\". The SNJR powers, and those for the Circumbendibus line, were extinguished. Although this was the rational solution, the Denburn Valley line was hugely expensive at ¬£200,000, even though only 1.5 miles (2.5 km) long. Much expensive land acquisition, housing demolition, a tunnel, and the new station were all required.R E H Mellor (editor), The Railways of Scotland: Papers of Andrew C O'Dell, University of Aberdeen, 1962, The new line and the Joint station came into use on 4 December 1867, by which time the SNER had been absorbed by the Caledonian Railway. Methven branch In 1858 a local railway promoted by local people opened, connecting Methven to Perth; it joined the SMJR main line at Almond Valley Junction, some distance north of Perth, and was worked by the SMJR, and from 1856 by the SNER. The SNER purchased it in 1864. Alyth branch Local interests elsewhere promoted a railway connection to Alyth, from Meigle on the former SMJR main line. It opened in 1861 and was worked by the SNER. The SNER absorbed it in 1863. Sold to the Caledonian Railway The Scottish North Eastern Railway had been formed by the amalgamation of two smaller companies in 1856. It had long been in a \\"loose association\\" with the Caledonian Railway, and on 10 August 1866 it was itself absorbed into the Caledonian. The Caledonian now controlled lines from Carlisle to Aberdeen. While this appeared to be the outcome it had long desired, it came at a heavy price: Parliament was becoming uncomfortable with the monopoly power of large railway concerns, and granted the North British Railway running powers over much of the northern part of the Caledonian system. The NBR was building its own line from Arbroath to north of Montrose, where it made a junction, (Kinnaber Junction), with the Caledonian Railway. In 1878 the NBR bridged the Firth of Tay at Dundee, giving it direct access from Edinburgh and Fife to the north shore of the Firth, and Parliament ordered that the Dundee and Arbroath Railway be transferred to joint ownership: jointly between the Caledonian and the NBR. This took effect from 1 February 1880, and gave the NBR an independent route from Edinburgh to Kinnaber, and running powers from there to Aberdeen. From 1923 Under the terms of the Railways Act 1921, the main line railways of Great Britain were \\"grouped\\"; the Caledonian Railway was a constituent of the new London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) and the North British Railway was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). For the time being there continued to be two competing routes to Aberdeen from the south. When the railways were nationalised in 1948 this state of affairs continued and the pattern of passenger and goods trains remained relatively unaffected by the new common ownership. However the decline in usage of the railways, especially local railways in sparsely populated areas, forced consideration of rationalisation, and it was determined that the former NBR route should continue, with the former SNER route closing. This took effect in 1967. The main route for trains from central Scotland to Aberdeen was therefore via Dundee, Arbroath and Montrose. Thus the Dundee and Arbroath line was still in use; the A&FR; line was closed except for a short section at Arbroath from the station to the point of divergence of the NBR and Caledonian lines. The old Aberdeen Railway was retained from Kinnaber Junction to Aberdeen. The former SMJR line from Perth to Forfar was closed except for the first section to Stanley Junction, where the Inverness line diverged. The entirety of the rest of the SNER system closed (although some local goods connections remained in use for a while). The heritage section of the Brechin branch is now operated by the Caledonian Railway Brechin Ltd, which started operation in 1993. The railway network is substantially unchanged from that time; domestic Scottish passenger services are operated by Abellio ScotRail. A limited through service from London to Aberdeen and from London to Inverness is operated by London North Eastern Railway. Trains to and from English destinations other than London are operated under the brand name CrossCountry, and night sleeping car trains to and from London are operated by Caledonian Sleeper.

Including Skiddaw, they occupy a wide area to the north of Keswick. Smooth sweeping slopes predominate with a minimum of tarns or crags. Blencathra in the south east of the group is the principal exception to this trend. Partition of the Lakeland Fells The Lake District is a National Park in the north west of the country which, in addition to its lakes, contains a complex range of hills. These are known locally as fells and range from low hills to the highest ground in England. Hundreds of tops exist and many writers have attempted to draw up definitive lists. In doing so the compilers frequently divide the range into smaller areas to aid their description. The most influential of all such authors was Alfred Wainwright whose Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells series has sold in excess of 2 million copies,: The Wainwright Society - The Alfred Wainwright Centenary 2007 being in print continuously since the first volume was published in 1952. Wainwright divided the fells into seven geographical areas, each surrounded by valleys and low passes. While any such division must be arbitrary- and later writers have deviated to a greater or lesser extent from this blueprint- Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994) Richards, Mark: Lakeland Fellranger series: Collins (2002)ff: Mid-Western Fells Wainwright's sevenfold division remains the best known partitioning of the fells into 'sub ranges', each with its own characteristics. The Northern Fells are one of these divisions, covered by volume 5 of Wainwright's work.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 5: Boundaries Bannerdale Crags from Mungrisdale The Northern Fells form a self-contained unit, quite remote from the other ranges. The western boundary is formed by the course of the River Derwent north of Keswick and the southern perimeter by the River Greta, one of its principal feeders. The River Caldew bounds the eastern edge of the group, flowing away toward Carlisle. At Caldbeck the Calder is joined by the Whelpo Beck which drains many of the northern slopes. Only on the east, between the headwaters of the Greta and Caldew, does a bridge of higher ground strike out to connect with the rest of Lakeland, a long ridge curving southward to connect with Great Mell Fell in the Eastern Fells. This ridge, whilst significant topographically, is in many places unnoticed on the ground. The deep trough of Bassenthwaite wards off the North Western Fells, while the Central Fells rise beyond Keswick and the Greta. North of the area defined by Wainwright the countryside takes on a moorland character, gradually declining toward the Solway Firth. Some of the minor tops in this area were covered by Wainwright in his later Outlying Fells volume, published in 1974. Topography The Northern Fells occupy a circular area about 10 miles in diameter. The centre is slightly lower, an area of upland grazing and marshland known as Skiddaw Forest. This name may be misleading since the only trees form the windbreak of Skiddaw House. This isolated building, 3 miles from roads or other habitation, was once a shepherd's bothy. It currently serves as a youth hostel. Skiddaw Forest stands at the head of the three major rivers of the Northern Fells. The Caldew begins eastward, Dash Beck flows north west and the Glenderaterra to the south. These streams divide the circular area into three distinct sections. The highest ground is in the south west, between the Glenderaterra and Dash Beck. This is the Skiddaw group, well known in views down Borrowdale and Derwentwater. The steep but sweeping slopes, deep folds and smooth texture can best be described as resembling a heavy sheet of velvet laid over a supporting frame. Skiddaw stands in the centre of the group, surrounded by its many satellites. Above Bassenthwaite are Ullock Pike, Long Side, Carl Side and the sometimes wooded Dodd. Eastward are Skiddaw Little Man, Lonscale Fell and the diminutive Latrigg, a pleasant short climb from Keswick. The Tongue, Bowscale Fell The south eastern sector is formed around Blencathra with its blasted crags and knife-edge ridges overlooking the Keswick to Penrith road. The northern ridges lead to Souther Fell (of 'Spectral Army' fame), Bannerdale Crags, Bowscale Fell and Mungrisdale Common, the most inexplicable of Wainwight's choice of fells with a barely discernible summit. The northern section is known commonly as 'Back o'Skiddaw' and contains many lower fells of a gentler nature, although the paths to climb them can be long. In these hills are many evidences of historic mining activity, a testament to the mineral wealth beneath. The group has a central apex at Knott with Great Calva standing to the south above Skiddaw Forest. High Pike (Caldbeck) and Carrock Fell rise to the east, marching along the Caldew valley. The western ridges are more complex and include Great Sca Fell, Meal Fell, Great Cockup, Little Cockup, Brae Fell and Longlands Fell. Alone to the extreme west across the tarn of Over Water stands Binsey. Access for walkers Great Sca Fell from Meal Fell The Northern Fells are entirely surrounded by roads, but traversed by none. Keswick and Threlkeld provide good access to the south from the A66 road for the Skiddaw and Blencathra groups respectively. The minor road along the eastern boundary connects the hamlets of Mosedale and Mungrisdale and gives equally good access to the Caldew and other eastern valleys. Further minor roads circuit the northern perimeter for operations Back o'Skiddaw, connecting finally to the Keswick - Carlisle road along the shore of Bassenthwaite. From here the Dash Valley and Longside Edge can be gained. A service track follows Dash Beck past its major fall (Whitewater Dash) to Skiddaw House, the easiest entrance to Skiddaw Forest. The tourist route up Skiddaw will generally be busy, but solitude can easily be found on the northern fells.

It was designed by architect Roger Stephenson and built as part of collaboration between Tom Bloxham's development company Urban Splash and Irwell Valley in 2002. The development won a number of awards including the Housing Design Award in 2001,Housing Design Award Roses Design Awards - best residential project in 2002Roses Design Awards - best residential project and in 2003 won the MSA Design Award in the residential section.MSA Design Award Its most prestigious award came in 2004 when it was awarded the Royal Institute of British Architects RIBA Award. Architect Roger Stephenson liked the design so much that he bought a top floor apartment for himself. Background The site was formerly a contaminated petrol filling station at 417 Barlow Moor Road, an arterial route connecting Cheshire to Manchester city centre via the suburb of Chorlton-cum-Hardy. The site was acquired by the Irwell Valley company in the late 1990s. The company, concerned it was acquiring the image of a \\"worthy-but-dull\\" organization,Building for Life instigated a limited invited architectural competition in 1999 to design a scheme for approximately 20 homes on the site and invited four high-profile architects including Stephenson Bell (now Stephenson:ISA Studio), MBLC and Sterling Award winners Ian Simpson and Stephen Hodder to compete for the instruction. Each submission was submitted anonymously and the design brief was to provide \\"space, light and warmth, flexibility, integration of external environment, and the maximisation of natural heat, ventilation and light\\" with Manchester City Council planning department requiring a distinctive landmark design providing variety to a location predominantly made up of two-storey semi-detached residential properties and low-rise retail units. The design by Stephenson Bell won the competition. Tom Bloxham, of Urban Splash, one of the judges, admired the scheme so much that he offered to become a joint venture partner in the development. After Urban Splash came on board the scheme was altered slightly to provide underground parking with additional duplex units along its front elevation on Barlow Moor Road.  Design  The scheme is predominantly of three-storey construction, with a five-storey element overlooking Chorlton Park. All units can be accessed by disabled users and the individual apartments are accessed via an open timber deck with a lift servicing all floors including the basement car park. The building has low embodied energy, is highly insulated. Communal space includes the underground car park, circulation areas, roof garden and courtyard garden with barbecue facility and basement bicycle store. There is a single entrance devised to encourage communal activity. Natural light is maximised by the orientation of its living rooms with bedrooms located on the inner or courtyard side of the building to minimize noise from the street. Each apartment has a balcony with louvred screens on rollers to provide shade and privacy. They are designed to be an extension of the living space and are constructed using a frame of green-oak posts and beams which were reclaimed from a wind-damaged forest in France. The architect used high insulation and energy conservation measures to ensure energy efficiency and the U value of the building is increased to 0.11 to ensure low heating costs. Its construction is of timber platform frame improved cost effectiveness and used renewable materials. The external materials are designed to be easily maintained through the use of robust materials. Construction The building employs a timber frame construction, with innovative balconies of reclaimed bare timber which overlook Chorlton Park across Barlow Moor Road.Picture of Manchester Chorlton Park Apartments designed by Stephenson Bell photography media portfolio by Aidan O'RourkeEWM: Chorlton May 2004 The structure gives the appearance of masonry, but it is actually a highly insulated timber frame. The units all have generous balconies, framed in wind-toppled French oak, with sliding louvred shutters to control privacy and sunlight, which look out on to the parkland across the road. This is quite a busy thoroughfare, particularly at peak hours, but the flats are remarkably quiet. Contaminated fill was cleared, providing space for a basement car park of in situ concrete. Sustainable construction and low heating and maintenance costs were among the priorities in developing the site. To deliver the necessary level of heat retention, we made walls and floors of sealed units filled with insulating material. Each unit is formed from timber joists some 300 mm deep, set close together and sandwiched between floorboards or sheets of marine ply. Externally, the architect's choice of materials is emphasized by the oak-framed balconies provided for every apartment.

Patrick Farrah was born and raised in Southern California. Dropping out of junior college in the first year, in 1962 he took a job at National Lumber and Supply Company in the Los Angeles Area. As the company grew into a small chain, he worked his way up from stock boy to executive vice president and general manager of National Lumber and Supply. In 1977, following a disagreement with the owners, he left the company. With a background in merchandising, Farrah in 1978 started his own big box home improvement retailer called Homeco. At the time, Bernard Marcus and Arthur Blank wanted to start a company that eventually became Home Depot. On seeing Homeco, Marcus realized that Farrah shared the same vision he had for a big box retailer. Marcus and Blank looked into buying Homeco, but the business had financing issues. When Homeco went out of business, they hired Farrah to help them launch Home Depot. He was offered a position as chief merchandising officer.

History Jim Younkin of Springdale, Arkansas completed a frame of this aircraft in 1989 and a homebuilt model earlier in 1985 with the help from Bud Dake. Three Mullicoupes were flying by 1997. The idea of this design came to Younkin and Dake at the Ottumwa, Iowa Antique Airplane Association's Fly-In in 1982 after a discussion about Younkin's Mister Mulligan. Bud Dake suggested they design a 2-seat aircraft which would be as fast as the Mister Mulligan but powered by a smaller P&W; R-985 engine. Younkin then designed a scale model which was somewhat of a cross between the Benny Howard-designed Mister Mulligan but with the fuselage shape of a Monocoupe. The Mullicoupes are a clean-sheet design utilizing a steel tube fuselage double-covered in fabric with built up wood wings skinned in aircraft plywood. The airfoil used on the Mullicoupe is the NACA 23012 having a chord of 63\\", but with an elliptical and tapered planform. The flaps are full Fowler flaps that travel on hidden hinges built into the wings, which is another Younkin original design. Today Three original Mullicoupes were created and a fourth was started but never finished. At present they are owned by Mark Holliday, Mr. Younkin himself, and Red Lerille. A fourth Mullicoupe, owned by Stein Bruch of Minnesota, is being completed with the assistance of Jim Younkin. The Black/Red Mullicoupe N274Y which was completed by Bud Dake (deceased) is owned by Mark Holliday, is on display and flies at the Vintage Aero Flying Museum, Platte Valley Airpark, Hudson, Colorado. Mr. Holliday is known to travel extensively with this black and red Mullicoupe, making appearances at fly-ins around the American Midwest. The Red Younkin-owned Mullicoupe N273X suffered a loss of power which resulted in a forced landing in a field near Siloam Springs, Arkansas on November 10, 2009.https://www.ntsb.gov/aviationquery/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20091110X71112&ntsbno;=CEN10LA046&akey;=1 The aircraft suffered significant damage, but is currently being repaired.

It was made as a Quota quickie.  Plot  Peter Middleton is an unemployed car salesman. He rescues hungry street urchin Billy, who has been caught stealing from a street vendor, and takes him under his wing. Peter rents a room. He has no money, but Mrs. Badger, the landlady, is too kindhearted to turn the pair away. When an acquaintance mentions that he has a client who wants to purchase a 1934 Bentley, Peter sees an opportunity to make a commission and scours the streets. He finds one and brazenly inspects it, much to the puzzlement of the chauffeur. In the process, Peter accidentally backs into Cynthia Hatch. When he pretends the car is his, she gets him to take her to a fine restaurant. She lets him believe she is also out of work, but in reality, she is the Bentley's owner. She is well known to the restaurant staff, but she asks the maitre d' to pretend to not know her to play a trick on Peter. Peter eventually confesses he has no money. She talks him into trying to see Mr. Hatch, the wealthy head of several petrol-related companies (and her father). Peter spends all night devising a plan to make petrol stations more attractive to customers by offering additional services, such as dining, dancing and even swimming pools. Meanwhile, Cynthia asks her father to see Peter. The following day, Peter gets to meet Hatch, but Hatch turns him down without even giving Peter a chance to explain his plan. Hatch jokingly suggests he go see Blue Point, a rival which is being beaten down by his company. Peter does so, and is hired as their manager. Peter makes Blue Point a great success, much to the chagrin of Hatch, who had been hoping to buy the struggling company. Peter hires Cynthia as his secretary, still unaware of her true identity. Within a year, Blue Point has overtaken and soared past Hatch's company. When Peter learns that a bypass is going to be built, he plans to buy sites for petrol stations along the route before Hatch hears about it. However, George Hamlin, Blue Point's publicist, has done such a poor job that Peter threatens to sack him; George betrays the plan to Hatch, who outbids Peter's company for all the sites. After Peter receives the bad news, he sees Cynthia taking money from Hatch and concludes that she betrayed him. When he confronts her, she denies it and storms out, but not before revealing that Hatch is her father. Afterward, Peter learns that the bypass will not be built for another fifteen years. Hatch offers to sell some of his holdings to Peter, those he believes the bypass will make worthless. Knowing otherwise, Peter accepts. After the sale, Hatch learns of the delay and realises he has been outwitted. However, he is not too displeased, having come to respect Peter. When Peter runs into George outside Hatch's office, he realises who the real traitor is. Peter then reconciles with Cynthia, much to her father's delight.

Usually, only the upper eyelashes are curled. History There were different patents of this invention between 1923 and 1940. The first known patent for the eyelash curler states that it was filed by Charles Stickel and William McDonell from Rochester, New York. However, William Joseph Beldue is recognized as one the first inventors while he was working for Kurlash Co., in Rochester, NY. William Beldue and his Kurlash Company held patents in Canada, the United States and Great Britain for the eyelash curler and improvements to it. In the 1930s and in 1940s, at the top of the make up fashion, these curlers were very popular and not expensive. The eyelash curler was patented April 7, 1931 and the images drawn in the patent application look very much the same as the eyelash curlers seen on the market today. Originally named Rodal, the brand changed the product‚Äôs name to Kurlash. Eyelash curlers are usually made of metal, and often have rubber pads where the curlers make contact with the lashes. The general design of these devices remains the same from 1940s. Manufacturers include Shiseido and Shu Uemura.  Types  The two most common types of eyelash curlers are heated curlers and traditional eyelash curlers. Heated eyelash curlers deliver a more intense curl that lasts longer. However, a simpler step to add to an eye makeup routine includes a more traditional, unheated eyelash curler. An unheated curler that is curved for the natural shape of an individual's eye includes a plentiful enough pad to press against eyelashes. Before using, an unheated curler can be heated for a short time with a hair dryer, but not to the extent to burn the delicate skin above the eyes. Self-heating, battery-operated units are available. Disadvantages Among many advantages, there are some disadvantages to the eyelash curler. If not used with care, pulling on the eyelashes while curling can lead to weakening of the roots. Many people can damage their eyelashes by holding down the clamp on their lashes for increased lengths of time, leading to their lashes either being pulled out or falling out due to the stress of continuous clamping. This may result in the eyelashes becoming weak and eventually lead to shedding which can be very bad for an eye because they protect the eye from wind and dust and don‚Äôt grow back quickly. If not used carefully, eyelash curlers can lead to accidents where a user pinches the eyelid. Depending on the amount of pressure they apply, this can cause a serious injury to the eye. Similarly, when used warm, an eyelash curler, especially those made of metal, can cause serious burns to the eyelid. Also, some heated eyelash curlers require batteries to run, which will require maintenance to run in terms of replacement on time for smooth functioning.

It is a social panorama of the city of London, seen largely through the eyes of the employees of the firm Twigg & Dersingham, at No. 8, Angel Pavement. Their lives are changed after the arrival of a mysterious Mr Golspie, who assures the future of their veneer-and-inlay company through imports from the Baltic. The story has as backdrop the high levels of unemployment and economic insecurity of late 1920s London, immediately before the Great Depression. Dedicated to C. S.

He discusses his immediate plans with the crew. The first chapter contains a detailed description of a fictional street in the EC postcode area called Angel Pavement, and the employees at Twigg & Dersingham. Business has not been good, and Mr Dersingham is trying to decide whom to sack. Mr Golspie arrives with a dispatch case containing a sample book of veneers and inlays, and asks to see Mr Dersingham. After a short delay, he is admitted to Mr Dersingham's office, and there is a long discussion, after which both men leave mysteriously. Mr Smeeth is baffled, especially when Mr Dersingham rings up and tells him to sack their senior traveller, Mr Goath. The second chapter introduces the tobacconist T. Benenden, and shows Mr Smeeth's family and home life. The next morning, Dersingham still has not returned to the office, and during lunch Mr Smeeth hears an unpleasant story about the failure of an umbrella firm called Claridge & Molton. He wonders if Mr Dersingham's absence indicates that they are all about to lose their jobs. But at five, Mr Dersingham returns and informs Mr Smeeth that the newcomer has offered a cheap supply of veneers from the Baltic, and their immediate future is assured. The next evening, Mr Golspie takes Mr Smeeth out for a drink at the White Horse, and tells him he ought to ask for a rise. A new typist is employed, Poppy Sellers, and Mr Dersingham invites Mr Golspie to a black tie dinner party at his home. The party is not a success, firstly because of the incompetence of the servants and secondly because of the unexpected arrival of the daughter, Lena Golspie, who quarrels with Miss Verever and Mrs Dersingham. The fourth chapter depicts one of the miserable weekends of the lonely young clerk, Mr Turgis, who wanders around London taking in any amusements he can afford. On the Monday after, he sees Lena Golspie for the first time, and is smitten. The fifth chapter depicts the narrow world of the typist, Miss Matfield, and her disastrous date with Norman Birtley, which is enlivened only by an accidental meeting with Mr Golspie, who gives her a box of chocolates on a whim. Later on Mr Golspie seems even more glamorous, when, shortly before leaving for a short trip, he asks her to take down letters on board the moored steamship Lemmala, and pours her some vodka. Mr Smeeth obtains a rise in salary, and after talking to Benenden, he celebrates by going to a concert at Queen's Hall, where he enjoys Brahms's First Symphony. On returning home he finds out that his daughter Edna has been sacked, but he is not terribly dismayed; he admits to his wife that he has been given a rise, something which he had been planning to keep secret. On Saturday night his wife's cousin, Fred Mitty, and his family, arrive for a party, and Mr Smeeth quickly comes to loathe them after they wreck the parlour and damage some of his clothes. Mr. Turgis has become obsessed with Lena Golspie, and jumps at a chance to see her again when he delivers some money from her father. She is bored, and takes him out to the cinema, flirting with him afterwards. They go on a second date, but she does not turn up to a third date, and he is devastated. Mr Golspie returns shortly before Christmas, goes away again on Christmas Eve, and returns again in time for New Year's Eve, on which he contrives to take Miss Matfield out for the evening. They begin to go on dates secretly. Mr. Smeeth falls out with his wife, and is later disturbed by the departure of the office boy Stanley and a road accident involving the tobacconist Benenden. His son George seems to be employed by crooks, and Mr Golspie makes an arrangement with Mr Dersingham which strikes Smeeth as suspicious. He goes to visit Benenden at the hospital. Mr Turgis is consumed with jealousy, and one Friday night he turns up unannounced at Lena's home and fights with her. Thinking he has strangled her, he wanders at random through London before arriving at Twigg & Dersingham, where Mr Golspie and Miss Matfield are \\"working late\\". He admits everything in despair, and they drive to Carrington Villas, but Lena is not there ‚Äì she has run off. Mr Golspie sacks Mr Turgis. He returns to his rented room and considers suicide. The next morning, Poppy Sellers arrives to deliver his last pay packet, and they have a long talk which reconciles him to the idea of spending time with her. In Chapter 11, Mr. Dersingham breaks the news to Mr Smeeth that Mr. Golspie has swindled them all and fled; the firm faces imminent bankruptcy. Mr. Dersingham returns home, obviously tipsy in front of their friends, and his wife is infuriated. But when she is fully informed of what has happened she feels a surge of energy. Mr. Smeeth returns home, and finding the Mittys there, throws them out, an action which restores his energy, as does unexpected sympathy from Mrs Smeeth. The epilogue depicts the unabashed Golspies shipping out from London, on their way to South America: \\"A string of barges passed them...a gull dropped, wheeled, flashed, was gone...the gleam faded from the face of the river; a chill wind stirred; the distant banks...retreated; and even the smoky haze of London city slipped away from them...\\" Reception George Orwell reviewed Angel Pavement in The Adelphi in 1930. Orwell, writing under his real name E. A. Blair, argued that Priestley's prose fails to \\"touch the level at which memorable fiction begins\\", lacking beauty, profundity and humour, and that \\"Mr Priestley's work is written altogether too easily, is not laboured upon as good fiction must be‚Äînot, in the good sense of the phrase, worked out.\\" Dismissing comparisons between Priestley and Charles Dickens as absurd, Orwell suggested that rejecting such blandishments would make possible an appreciation of Angel Pavement as \\"an excellent holiday novel, genuinely gay and pleasant, which supplies a good bulk of reading matter for ten and sixpence.\\" Responding to Orwell in The Guardian in 2012, D. J. Taylor reads the novel as a study of \\"detachment, the absolute conviction expressed by most of its characters that their lives would be better lived out elsewhere, doing other things and in the company of other people\\" and concluded that Angel Pavement \\"is a terrific example of the mainstream novel's occasional habit of noticing some of the features of ordinary life that so-called highbrow productions routinely ignore\\". Adaptations In December 1957 the BBC produced a television adaptation of the novel, featuring the following cast:\\"Angel Pavement (TV Series 1957)\\" at imdb.com *Maurice Denham ‚Äì Mr. Smeeth *Catherine Feller ‚Äì Lena Golspie *Thomas Gallagher ‚Äì Captain *Ursula Jenkins ‚Äì Edna Smeeth *Alec McCowen ‚Äì Turgis *Maureen Pryor ‚Äì Mrs. Smeeth *Robert Scroggins ‚Äì Stanley Poole *Anthony Sharp ‚Äì Mr. Dersingham *Sydney Tafler ‚Äì Mr. Golspie *Margaret Tyzack ‚Äì Miss Matfield *Robert Vahey ‚Äì George Smeeth Another television adaptation aired in Britain in 1967.

It was promoted by local people who formed the Aylesbury Railway to construct it, and it made a junction with the London and Birmingham Railway at Cheddington. That company worked the branch line, and when the L&BR; merged with others in 1846 to form the London and North Western Railway, the line was in effect the Aylesbury branch of the LNWR. It was important to Aylesbury, securing it a cheaper way of bringing in essentials and sending out its agricultural produce, as well as greatly improving passenger communication. The early terminus at Aylesbury was relocated and expanded in 1889. However other railways were built serving Aylesbury, and in time these offered easier communication: the inconvenience of passenger travel involving changing trains at Cheddington made the branch line unattractive. The passenger service was discontinued in 1953 and the line was closed completely in 1963. Origins The Aylesbury Railway branchThe London and Birmingham Railway opened in stages, through Cheddington on 9 April 1838, and throughout on 17 September 1838. It formed, with the Grand Junction Railway, the backbone of early railways in Great Britain.Bill Simpson, The Aylesbury Railway: the First Branch Line, Oxford Publishing Company, Sparkford, 1989, , page 14C J Gammell, LMS Branch Lines: England and Wales, Oxford Publishing Company, Sparkford, 1991, , page 87 As the London and Birmingham line was being built, business interests in Aylesbury were already thinking of how a railway connection might be made between their town and the new railway. In 1815 the town had ensured its connection to the canal network for the transport to market of its agricultural produce, and now wished to do the same with a railway. In these early times, goods traffic was the dominant commercial force. Serious discussions took place over the construction of a branch line and a scheme went to the 1836 session of Parliament. The Aylesbury Railway Act obtained the Royal Assent on 19 May 1836,Simpson, page 11G Machell, Railway Development at Aylesbury, in Railway Magazine November 1955Colin G Maggs, Branch Lines of Buckinghamshire, Sutton Publishing, Stroud, 2000, , pages 148, 159, 151 and 153 without opposition in Parliament.Francis Whishaw, The Railways of Great Britain and Ireland Practically Described and Illustrated, published by John Weale, London, 1842, pages 10 to 13 All seemed to be going well, until a local bank, William Medley, Son and Company, of Aylesbury, failed in January 1837.In addition, the bank's official auditor appointed to quantify the loss absconded with ¬£2,000 in cash.Daniel Hardcastle Junior, Banks and Bankers, London, 1843, page 444 The bank had been strong supporters of the line, and many local businesspeople were embarrassed, causing a local financial panic, and the loss of promised subscriptions to the railway. After urgent reflection, the Aylesbury Railway Company decided to proceed with its branch line, but any ideas it may have harboured regarding an extension on to Oxford, were now dismissed.Simpson, page 13 Construction and opening Aylesbury train at Cheddington on the Last DayThe first sod was cut in July 1838. The delay in starting was due to the banking crisis, but also to reconsideration as to the advisability of proceeding with a line to Oxford, and to the problem in negotiating a working arrangement with the London and Birmingham Railway. It was not until 14 December 1837 that the working agreement was finalised. Construction was easy, as the line was almost entirely straight and level, with no road or river bridges. Space was made for double track, but only a single line was laid. The work had been estimated at ¬£50,000 and the actual cost was ¬£59,000. This included land acquisition and Parliamentary expenses.Simpson, page 15 The construction was under the general direction of Robert Stephenson. Whishaw described the line further: > The rails are chiefly of the parallel form [as opposed to fish-bellied]... > they are in 16 feet lengths, and fixed in chairs by means of wooden keys; > the chairs are placed 4 feet from centre to centre along the line of > railway; the sleepers are from 9 to 10 feet in length, and of full > scantling... > The station at Aylesbury is conveniently laid out: a triple way, connected, > at a convenient distance from the offices, with the main line, runs into a > railway-dock 33 feet wide at its entrance, and 12 feet at its connexion with > the terminal turn-table, the side space of which is 4 feet 10 inches;... the > quay [loading dock] on either side is about 10 feet in width.

The London and Birmingham Railway undertook to lease the line from 15 January 1840 for ¬£2,500 per annum, that is to say 5% on the estimated construction cost. At the outset the L&BR; had intended simply to own the track, and permit independent hauliers to operate on the line on a toll basis; however on reflection it was realised that this arrangement would hardly work for an intercity line like the L&BR;, and the Company decided to operate its own trains. The Aylesbury Railway opened on 10 June 1839.David Gould, The London and Birmingham Railway 100 Years On, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1987, , page 15 It was stated at a celebratory dinner later that \\"Prior to the railway opening the only means of travelling to London had been by coach which left Aylesbury at 6 o'clock in the morning arriving in London at 10 o'clock in the evening, 14 hours travelling. By use of the Aylesbury Railway this will now be two hours.\\" In operation An ordinary train service started the following day, 1 June; there were three trains on each weekday and two on Sundays, connecting with London trains at Cheddington. Goods trains began regular operation in November 1839.Simpson, page 17 On 15 January 1845 the lease of the Aylesbury Railway expired, and on 16 July 1846 the London and Birmingham Railway became part of the new London and North Western Railway; the new company purchased the Aylesbury company for ¬£60,000. When the line was opened there were no intermediate stations, but a new stopping place at Marston Crossing was in use as a station as early as 1857; nevertheless it was not until 1863 that it was recognised as a station proper and included in local timetables.Simpson, pages 26 and 27 Quick adds detail about the early days of Cheddington: it was referred to in company timetables of 20 June 1839 as \\"the Aylesbury Junction\\"; then as Cheddington early in 1840. It was not shown in Bradshaw until 1844, when only southbound main line trains were shown. Some Aylesbury trains operated to and from Tring.Michael Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England, Scotland and Wales: A Chronology, the Railway and Canal Historical Society, Richmond, Surrey, 2002 A form of absolute block workingPresumably the train staff and ticket system with block instruments. was brought into use on the branch on 18 November 1880.Simpson page 24 An improved terminus The original terminus at Aylesbury was cramped and unsuitable for the growing volume of traffic; a new station fronting High Street at Aylesbury was opened on Sunday 16 June 1889; the old station (at Station Street) was transferred to use as a goods station.Simpson, page 47 The new passenger station did not have a run-round loop, and arriving passenger trains were generally run round by propelling them to the goods yard points to release the engine, and gravitating the coaches back to the platform under the control of the guard.Simpson, page 51 In 1950 this procedure was rendered unnecessary with the introduction of push-and-pull trains, which did not require the engine to run round the train. Bletchley depot had three LMS push- and-pull sets, one for the Aylesbury line and one each for the Dunstable and Newport Pagnell lines. After nationalisation of the railways in 1948, the other stations at Aylesbury came under British Railways management as well as the Cheddington line station, and a distinction in names was considered necessary. The goods station was renamed Aylesbury High Street from 1 July 1950, and the passenger station was similarly renamed from 25 September the same year.Simpson, page 56 Decline Last day of the Aylesbury branchThroughout the twentieth century, the line had gradually lost business to more convenient railway routes; London could be reached direct by either of two other routes, and northward journeys were convenient by the Great Central Railway. In the winter of 1952-3 only four passenger trains ran each way on the branch, supplemented by one on Wednesdays and two on Saturdays. Except on Wednesdays and Saturdays the last train for Cheddington left Aylesbury at the early hour of 13:25 and made no London connection, for the branch had long ceased to be a useful route from Aylesbury to London. The line closed 2 February 1953 to passengers. It continued in use for goods traffic until 2 December 1963.

A member of the Irish Parliamentary Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for North Leitrim from 1885 to 1892 in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. He was a supporter of Charles Stewart Parnell. Conway was the son of Edward Conway of Moylough, near Tubbercurry, Co. Sligo. At the age of 13 he became a pupil teacher at St Anne's, Blackburn, Lancashire, and after five years entered St Mary's Training College, Hammersmith, London, which was run by the Brompton Oratory Fathers. From 1865 he was engaged in education. In 1871 he married Anne, daughter of Andrew Leonard of Aclare, Co. Sligo. Conway was an active Irish Nationalist and President of the Blackburn, Lancashire, Branch of the Irish National League of Great Britain. On 28 October 1885 he was selected at Carrick-on-Shannon as Nationalist candidate for the new seat of North Leitrim and in the December 1885 general election by almost 10 to 1 over a Conservative. He was then returned unopposed in 1886. He appears to have remained resident in Blackburn at least for a time as he was reported as presiding at a Nationalist meeting there on 30 November 1886. When the Irish Parliamentary Party split in December 1890 over Parnell's leadership, Conway supported Parnell. He strongly supported Parnell in the week-long meeting of the Party in Committee Room 15 of the House of Commons. Lyons1960, p.131 commented that he had a ‚Äòfutile altercation‚Äô with the Anti-Parnellite Thomas Sexton, and he also clashed with Timothy Healy. At the general election of 1892, Conway did not contest North Leitrim but fought Mid Tipperary as a Parnellite. However the Anti-Parnellite candidate won comfortably, Conway receiving just under one fifth of the vote in a three-cornered fight. He did not stand for Parliament again.To date it has not proved possible to find an obituary and it is therefore not known what Conway did in later life or when he died.  Footnotes  Sources  *F. S.

He is currently working as the head scout for Leicester City.  Playing career = Middlesbrough  Mills was born in Whitby, and brought up in Thornaby-on-Tees and while at school represented his country with England Schoolboys. After school, he attracted interest from several clubs, including Hull City, Stoke City, Manchester United and Burnley, but decided on a move to local team Middlesbrough, after missing close to a year due to injury, and signed for the club in July 1968 His first team debut came as a substitute towards the end of the 1968‚Äì69 season and he scored at Swindown Town in 1969‚Äì70 on his full debut. He became a regular two seasons later. As part of Boro's 1973‚Äì74 Second Division championship side, he scored the goal that earned the side promotion in the 1‚Äì0 victory over Luton Town. Mills came to the attention of the England Under 23 selectors, earning eight caps and scoring three goals. His best season in terms of goals was in the 1976‚Äì77 season, in which he scored 18 times in 41 games, making him top scorer that season. He retained that title the next season. In December 1976, Mills asked for a move and so was transfer listed at a value of ¬£200,000, but nobody came in for him. Two years later, his form had again caught the attention of other managers, and so in 1979, Ron Atkinson paid ¬£518,000 to take him to West Bromwich Albion, breaking the English transfer record and making Mills Britain's first half million pound footballer.  Other Clubs  Mills scored on his first full appearance for West Brom, but despite the huge sum of money invested in him he was not given many opportunities to prove himself, with injuries, loss of form and a switch to midfield limiting his goals. After scoring only six goals in 59 appearances, he was loaned out to Newcastle United. At the end of the loan, he moved to Sheffield Wednesday for just ¬£30,000, but he only remained there for a short time, moving back to Newcastle on a permanent transfer.  Back at Middlesbrough  In June 1984, Willie Maddren re-signed him for one season, in which he finished top scorer with 14 goals. He suffered an Achilles tendon injury and a broken arm the following season and did not play. He had a short spell after this playing for Darlington, where he ended his career as a player in 1987. After coaching Middlesbrough's juniors, Mills went on to play for Northern League side Whitby Town. He was seriously injured in a car crash on Tyneside, which claimed the life of his father. Later, he went on to work as a representative for a printing firm.  Scouting Roles  Following a stint as assistant chief scout at Newcastle United, where he worked under seven different managers, it was announced on 29 April 2008 that Mills would return to Middlesbrough to boost the recruitment team along with Gordon McQueen. Mills has since worked closely with Steve Walsh at Leicester City and Hull City, as a chief scout Mills has worked alongside Walsh to bring young emerging talent to Leicester City and Hull City with many ex-Manchester United youth players now found at both clubs.

Biography Gabetto was born in Turin, Italy, in the Aurora district of the Piedmont capital. He died in a commercial airplane tragedy as one of the victims of the 1949 Superga air disaster, when a plane carrying almost the entire Torino Football Club squad, the Grande Torino, crashed into the Superga hill near Turin. He was buried in the Cimitero Monumentale in Turin. Club career Gabetto (right) playing for Juventus between late 1930s and early 1940s Gabetto began his career with Juventus in 1934, scoring 102 goals for the club in seven seasons, 85 of which came in the league; he is still today one of the club's best goalscorers. In 1941 he was acquired by local rivals Torino, for a notable sum of 330,000 Lit.; the same season, Torino bought two other Juventus players: Felice Borel, and Alfredo Bodoira. He formed a notable attack alongside Ezio Loik and Valentino Mazzola, becoming a key player in the Grande Torino side which dominated Italy, winning five consecutive Serie A titles. Only he and his teammate Piero Operto were originally from Turin. In total, he scored 127 goals for Torino in 225 matches.

Nicknamed il barone (\\"the baron,\\" in Italian), he usually played as a centre-forward, and possessed \\"acrobatic\\" characteristics that apparently allowed him to produce \\"near-impossible\\" goals.

It automatically 'homes' on a point illuminated by a laser designator, typically operated by a ground-based artillery observer. Krasnopol projectiles are fired mainly from Soviet self- propelled howitzers such as the 2S3 Akatsiya and 2S19 Msta-S and intended to engage small ground targets such as tanks, other direct fire weapons, strong- points, or other significant point targets visible to the observer. It can be used against both stationary and moving targets (providing these remain within the observer's field of view). Krasnopol projectiles were used by the Russian military against those who had previously attacked Russia's Khmeimim Air Base in Syria with drones. Development The weapon system was developed in the Tula-based KBP Instrument Design Bureau under the supervision of A.G. Shipunov. Work on the project was initiated in the 1970s. In February 1986 the Krasnopol system was adopted by the Soviet Army under the designation 30F39, and began mass production in Izhmash and Izhmeh factories. Since 2002, it is augmented by the 120- and 122 mm Kitolov-2 laser-guided system. A 155 mm variant of the project was also developed to access the commercial markets, which can be fired from howitzers such as the G6 and M109A6. Besides Russia, the Krasnopol is also manufactured by Chinese defence industry conglomerate Norinco. Description The 2K25 Krasnopol systemFAS Williams, Walter, Threat Update: Krasnopol--A Laser-Guided Projectile for Tube Artillery Foreign Military Studies Office, Fort Leavenworth consists of the 30F39 guided shell, a 1D22, 1D20, or 1D15 laser target designator (LTD), and the 1A35 shot synchronization system. The laser designation system has a range of , while the projectile itself has a range of Jane's Ammunition Handbook 1994 (Alexandria: Jane's Information Group Inc., 1993), p. 210. . and a target seeker radius of . The two-part projectile is divided into the following sections: target seeker, guidance module, warhead and rear compartment. The seeker and guidance module are stored as a single component in sealed container, as is the rear section with warhead; this allows the oversized projectile to be loaded and transported inside existing ammunition containers in legacy self-propelled howitzers. The two components are joined immediately prior to firing. The system functions as follows. The observer determines the target location (e.g. map coordinates or bearing and distance from their own position), ensures that their laser target designator can 'mark' the target and requests or orders a fire mission against the target using Krasnopol. A gun is then aimed at the target location and a guided shell is fired. The firing unit uses their 1A35K command device to send a signal via a communications link confirming the firing of the projectile to the 1A35I observation post device with the observer. The laser target designator is then used to illuminate the target and the in-flight projectile detects the radiant laser energy reflected by the target and the navigation system steers the shell towards the point of greatest incident energy‚Äîthe designated target with top attack pattern. The iris of the optical seeker head is protected by a cap which is ejected by a mechanical timer upon firing. The guidance module contains an inertial reference system, a power source, various electric motors and controls and four folding canards used to execute command guidance signals. The warhead is a high explosive fragmentation type which can also be used against heavily armored vehicles such as tanks owing to the steep trajectory of the projectile which allows it to defeat the relatively thin roof armor on most vehicles. Behind the warhead is a rear compartment which houses four folding stabilizers. Krasnopol system can also fire a salvo from multiple artillery pieces on one target using a single laser designator. After destruction of the initial target, the LTD operator may request or order another target. If these subsequent targets are close together they should be upwind (from the previous target) to reduce smoke and dust interference with the designator. Krasnopol is capable of hitting targets moving at speeds up to . Variants *2K25 Krasnopol The original model of the Krasnopol was designed to be used with former Soviet-Bloc artillery systems of , such as D-20, 2S3 Akatsiya, 2A65 (Msta-B). Krasnopol carries a high explosive fragmentation warhead. The entire missile weighs . However, its length made it incompatible with the autoloader of the 2S19 152mm Self-Propelled Gun. *2K25M Krasnopol-M The Krasnopol-M was a miniaturized version of the projectile, developed in the mid-1990s by Shipunov's team at the KBP Design Bureau taking advantage of new electronics technology acquired in the design of the 120 mm Kitolov-2 guided projectile (similar in construction and purpose; this is in essence a smaller model of the Krasnopol to be used with the 2S9 NONA 120 mm mortar and designated 30F69 and a related projectile for 122 mm howitzers designated Kitolov-2M 30F69M) was made with a shorter length to enable it to be used with autoloader-equipped self-propelled guns without having to be disassembled into two parts. It also comes in an alternate caliber to allow it to be used with NATO-standard 155 mm howitzers. Besides the reduced total length, the Krasnopol-M also has a different protective cap for the optical seeker. *KM-1M Krasnopol-M2 The Krasnopol-M2, a further development based on Krasnopol-M, is a 155mm artillery projectile designed to engage armored targets. It uses a semi-active laser (SAL) guidance system in the terminal phase of its trajectory. *GP1: Chinese version of Krasnopol. *GP6: Chinese version of Krasnopol.

Classical scholar Thomson studied Classics at King's College, Cambridge where he attained First Class Honours in the Classical Tripos and subsequently won a scholarship to Trinity College, Dublin.Richard Roche, 'On Island Life and Strangling Goats', The Irish Times, 26 September 1998 At TCD he worked on his first book, Greek Lyric Metre, and began visiting Na Blascaoda√≠ in the early nineteen-twenties. He became lecturer and then Professor of Greek at NUI Galway. He moved back to England in 1934, when he returned to King's College, Cambridge, to lecture in Greek. He became a professor at Birmingham University in 1936, the year he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain. Thomson pioneered a Marxist interpretation of Greek drama. His Aeschylus and Athens (1941) and Marxism and Poetry (1945) won him international attention. In the latter book he argued a connection between the work song and poetry; and that pre-industrial songs were connected to ritual.Gerald Porter, 'The World's Ill-Divided': the Communist Party and Progressive Song, p. 181, in A Weapon in the Struggle (1998), editor Andy Croft. Thomson befriended, and was an important influence on Alfred Sohn-Rethel and his theory of the genesis of occidental thought in Ancient Greece through the invention of coining. Connections with the Blasket Islands He first visited Na Blascaoda√≠ (the Blasket Islands) off the west coast of Ireland in 1923. Mac Tom√°is, as he quickly became known to the islanders, had attended rudimentary Irish classes at a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in London before he went to Cambridge. When he arrived on the island, he immersed himself in the language. In six weeks of walking around, talking with Muiris √ì S√∫illeabh√°in and others, Mac Tom√°is achieved near complete fluency in the language. He spent several years with the people of the islands studying their language, history and culture. He maintained a special study of the now extinct community in Ireland, in which he perceived elements of surviving cultural resonances with historical society prior to the development of private property as a means of production. He became a champion of the Irish language. He had a role in the publication of the memoirs of Muiris √ì S√∫illeabh√°in, Fiche Bliain Ag F√°s in 1933.Muiris √ì S√∫illeabh√°in, http://www.kennys.ie/News/OldGalway/18112004-Muiris0Suilleabhain/ The introduction to √ì S√∫illeabh√°in's autobiography by E. M. Forster can also be attributed to Thomson. When he applied for the new position of lecturer of Greek in NUI Galway in 1931 he, in the words of Richard Roche, 'astonished the interview board with a flow of Blasket Irish' and was awarded the post.Richard Roche, 'On Island Life and Strangling Goats', The Irish Times, 26 September 1998 Communism In 1951, he was the only member of the Communist Party's Executive Committee to vote against the Party's programme The British Road to Socialism, because \\"the dictatorship of the proletariat was missing\\".Morning Star 9 January 1989 He also served on the Party's Cultural Committee. The Chinese revolution of 1949 had a profound effect on him and led to differences with the British Communist Party, from which he eventually drifted. He never lost his political beliefs. He was committed to working class education, including giving lectures to factory workers at Birmingham's Austin car plant. He also maintained a special affection and support for the Morning Star in his later years. Thomson authored three popular expositions on Marxism published by the China Policy Study Group in the early 1970s. From Marx to Mao Tse-tung: A study in revolutionary dialectics (1971); Capitalism and After: The rise and fall of commodity production (1973); and The Human Essence: The sources of science and art (1974). He is also the author of Marxism and Poetry (1945). Family Thomson married Katherine, daughter of Hugh Fraser and Jessie Stewart.

(2011). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Originally written in Greek, the Lausiac History was so popular it was translated into Arabic, Armenian, Coptic, Ethiopic, Latin, Syriac and Sogdian.Eric Orlin, ed., Routledge Encyclopedia of Ancient Mediterranean Religions (Routledge, 2016), p. 526. History The book was popular among monks all over the East, who appear to have added to it considerably in transcribing it. The first edition was a Latin version by Gentian Hervetus.Paris, 1555, reprinted by H. Rosweyde (\\"Vit√¶ patrum\\", VIII, Paris, 1628). A shorter Greek text was published by Johannes Meursius (Leyden, 1616), and a longer one by Fronton du Duc,\\"Auctarium bibliothec√¶ Patrum\\", IV, Paris, 1624. and a still more complete one by J. Cotelerius.\\"Monumenta eccl. gr√¶c√¶\\", III, Paris, 1686; reprinted in Patrologia Graeca, XXXIV, 995-1260. This longer version contains the text of Rufinus. Butler, Preuschen, and others think that the shorter text (of Meursius) is Palladius's authentic work, the longer version being interpolated. Am√©lineau holds that the longer text is all Palladius's work, and that the first thirty-seven chapters (about the monks of Lower Egypt) are mainly an account of what the author saw and heard, though even here he has also used documents. But he thinks the second part (about Upper Egypt) is merely a compilation from a Coptic or Greek document which Rufinus also used; so that Palladius's visit to Upper Egypt must be a literary fiction. But the shorter text itself exists in various forms. A Syrian monk, Anan-Isho, living in the sixth-seventh centuries in Mesopotamia, translated the Lausiac History into Syriac with further interpolations.\\"Paradisus Patrum\\", ed. Bedjan, \\"Acta martyrum et sanctorum\\", VII, Paris, 1897; tr. E. A. Wallis Budge, \\"The Paradise of the Fathers\\", 2 vols. London, 1907. At one time the Lausiac History was considered a compilation of imaginary legends.Weingarten, \\"Der Ursprung des M√∂nchtums\\", Gotha, 1877, and others. Roman Catholic scholars at the beginning of the twentieth century argued that it was also a serious source on Egyptian monasticism, in between the miracles. Liturgical usage In the Orthodox Church (the Byzantine Rite) the Lausiac History is read at matins on the weekdays of Great Lent as two of the patristic readings, after the third kathisma and after the third ode of the canon. \\"Archbishop Averky Liturgics -- The Peculiarities of Daily Lenten Services -- Lenten Matins\\", Retrieved 2011-08-03 An extract from the introduction \\"In the fourth and fifth centuries of our era Egypt had come to be regarded with great reverence throughout Christendom as a Holy Land of piety. \\"Pilgrims came from all parts to visit the saints who lived there, and several wrote descriptions of what they saw and heard, which are among the most interesting documents of the early Church. Palestine was so near that it was usually included in their tour; the glamour of its sacred sites, which remains with us still when that of Egypt has faded into oblivion, was already potent. But Palestine was clearly second to Egypt in the affections of the pilgrims. \\"[As] expressed by Chrysostom ... Egypt ... was destined to be more fervent than any other, to have its towns and even its deserts peopled by armies of saints living the life of angels, and to boast the greatest, after the apostles, of all saints, the famous Antony. \\"Palladius, ... made a pilgrimage to this holy land, like so many others, and stayed there many years. ...

He has been described as \\"one of the very finest drummers in all of pop/rock\\". Early life Elliott discovered jazz music when he was 10 or 11 and wanted to become a drummer. He attended Nelson Grammar School, but is a self-taught drummer, who learnt to drum with home- made brushes and sticks, on tins and other household items, by copying Chico Hamilton of the Gerry Mulligan Quartet and Gene Krupa of the Benny Goodman Orchestra. Elliott was an original member of Johnny Theakston and The Tremeloes, who formed in 1959. Fronted by the vocalist Johnny Theakston, Elliott drummed alongside guitarists Jerry Wilcox and Mick Hay, and bassist William \\"Bonny\\" Oliver. In late 1960 they sent a demo tape to BBC Radio's Saturday Club, calling themselves Shane Fenton & The Fentones, but Theakston died before they received a reply. Having been offered an audition, the band's roadie Bernard Jewry (later known as Alvin Stardust), stepped in as vocalist, adopting the stage name Shane Fenton at Theakston's mother's request. Tommy Sanderson became their manager, and negotiated a record deal with EMI who released \\"I'm a Moody Guy\\", which reached 19 on the UK singles chart. The next three singles failed to chart, \\"Cindy's Birthday\\" was then a minor hit, before the following three singles also flopped, and the band broke up in April 1963. Elliott also played in Ricky Shaw and the Dolphins, a Manchester band led by guitarist Tony Hicks who left to join The Hollies in April 1963. Shortly after, the Hollies drummer Don Rathbone left and Elliott also joined the Hollies, whilst Jewry and Sanderson became the band's joint managers. *For Elliott's career with The Hollies, see The Hollies As of 1963 Elliott still plays with the Hollies, and has recorded with almost no other band since 1963.

It is noted for its parish close. Etymology Historic dioceses of Brittany The place name element lan or lam (llan in Welsh) originally signified an enclosure, particularly a sacred enclosure, and later came to mean a church. The name Lampaul therefore means church or enclosure dedicated to St Paulinus. St Pol (Paol, Paul, or Paulinus) was one of the seven founder saints of Brittany, a 6th-century Welsh missionary closely associated with the L√©on diocese of Brittany, in which Lampaul-Guimiliau is situated. Parish closes are a distinctive feature of this diocese, although they are not entirely confined to it. In the Middle Ages, the village was part of the parish of Guimiliau. This means township of Miliau, a Breton saint of the 6th or 9th century. Later, rising prosperity and economic growth brought separate status, with a separate parish church. Hence the name in full means St Pol's Church in the Settlement of St Miliau. Sights=Parish close calvary that dominates the church yard of Lampaul-Guimiliau. Parish closes are a distinctive feature of the Breton culture of the L√©on region. The close is so-called because it is a church yard entirely enclosed by a wall, with a ceremonial entrance arch. The closes of the L√©on diocese date from the 16th and early 17th centuries, when the area was at the peak of its prosperity, founded on the hemp industry and on Channel and Atlantic trade. Belfry and portal. The parish close of Lampaul-Guimiliau commands the road junction at the centre of the village. It is one of the best examples of its kind. It contains not only the church and graveyard of the parish, but also a large and elaborate calvary or crucifix and a noted charnel house, both common features of Breton closes, and a vast belfry. The church and charnel house display a large body of polychrome sculpture, mainly of 16th or 17th century date and rich in complex Christian iconography, reflecting the preoccupations of the Counter- Reformation or Catholic Reformation. Belfry The church and belfry. The belfry or bell tower, constructed from 1573, was originally one of the highest in Finist√®re. However it was truncated by fire following a lightning strike in 1809. Charnel house The charnel house or ossuary dates from 1667 and was designed by the architect Guillaume Kerlezroux. it is dominated by a retable portraying the Risen Christ. Formerly it also housed a notable tableau of the Entombment of Christ, which has now been moved into the church itself. Polychrome interior The interior of the church is replete with polychrome sculpture and decoration. Dominating the nave is a 16th-century rood screen, showing the crucified Christ, attended by the Virgin Mary and St John the Apostle. Below this, scenes of the Passion are represented in rich detail. A number of complex retables focus on the Passion and on the lives and deeds of saints, including John the Baptist, St Margaret the Virgin, and St Lawrence. Each is divided into numerous panels, with episodes modelled in relief, and each is flanked by free-standing statuary. There are also a number of important separate free-standing pieces, including an oak Descent from the Cross, the Entombment, and St Pol. The baptistery is one of the most striking among the parish closes. It is an octagonal Baroque concoction, dating from about 1650. Unlike most of its kind, it is elaborately polychrome, with highly-elaborate pillars and finely-modelled representation of the baptism of Christ. The church also displays its banners. These are an important artifact of Breton culture. They form a rallying point for parishioners attending the local pilgrimage festivals, known as pardons.

It was met by the Communists' Counter-encirclement campaign at Northeastern Jiangxi Soviet (), also called the Counter-encirclement campaign at Northeastern Jiangxi Revolutionary Base (). The Nationalist campaign lasted from December 1930 to July 1931, and resulted in the destruction of the target base area. The base area The Jiangxi Soviet was a communist base in the northeastern part of Jiangxi guarded by the 10th Army of the Chinese Red Army, and it was the right flank of the Jiangxi Soviet. In comparison to the major communist base in southern Jiangxi, the Jiangxi Soviet, this communist base was much closer to the nationalist strongholds and it was at the forefront of the nationalist controlled regions, and consequently, it had become a main target the nationalists marked for destruction. The encirclement campaign against Jiangxi Soviet begun in December, 1930, shortly after the First encirclement campaign against Jiangxi Soviet. However, due to the allocation of available troops and other resources to the top priority target, the Jiangxi Soviet, the encirclement campaign against the Jiangxi Soviet was protracted, and was not over until July 1931 after the Third encirclement campaign against Jiangxi Soviet had already started. Commencement The initial stage of the campaign resulted in communist victory, with the Nationalists suffering three consecutive defeats immediately after the start of their encirclement campaign in the regions of Shangrao prefectural centre, Zhushanqiao (Áè†Â±±Ê°•, Pearl Mountain Bridge), and Hekou (Ê≤≥Âè£, River mouth), losing more than 1,500 troops in the process. A stalemate was reached as result, and the nationalists stopped their offensives. However, the huge number of the nationalist troops surrounding the Jiangxi Soviet still posed a major threat, and the nationalists could have struck at any time. To distract the enemy, the communist 10th Army of the Chinese Red Army launched diversion offensives in late March 1931 in the regions of Guixi (Ë¥µÊ∫™), and Yujiang (‰ΩôÊ±ü), and then continued their offensives in northern Fujian, annihilating several thousands nationalist troops in the process. After their eleven consecutive victories in northern Fujian, the communist main force returned in May 1931 and expanded the communist base further. Despite their victories, the communists had failed to distract the nationalists from redeploying any of their troops away from the Jiangxi Soviet. Completion The final blow finally arrived when the much anticipated nationalist all-front offensive begun in July 1931, which was unexpectedly helped by a highly unlikely source: the communists themselves. As Wang Ming prevailed in the power struggles against Mao Zedong, Mao's proven effective strategies and tactics were abolished as well when Mao's power and influence dropped, and the Jiangxi Soviet was one of the first place that reflected the rise of Wang Ming and the decline of Mao Zedong, despite the fact Mao was still very much in power elsewhere, such as in the Jiangxi Soviet. However, as the military doctrines of Wang Ming and his supporters were adopted and put in use, they were proven to be completely unsuited for defending the communist base. As a result, the communist force was annihilated and the communist base of Jiangxi Soviet was reduced to a tiny fraction of its original size centered at Geyuan. Although the communist base was not fully destroyed until March 1943 when the last of its communist guerrillas were finally eliminated and the communist commander Yang Wenhan (Êù®ÊñáÁø∞) captured, (who was subsequently executed by the nationalists seven months later in October in the region of Goose' Beak (E'zui ÈπÖÂò¥) at the northern gate of the city of Yiyang (ÂºãÈò≥)), it was no longer a threat to the nationalists like once it was. The nationalists did not even bother to continue any follow-up campaigns after the annihilation of their communist enemy in July 1931, except a single eradication campaign at the end of 1938 in which over 17,000 nationalist troops were deployed. The surviving communist base and communist force were insignificant enough for the nationalists to declare a victory and redeploy their forces against communists elsewhere. As for the communists, the destruction of its Jiangxi Soviet meant that the important right flank of Jiangxi Soviet was lost, and more nationalist forces were available to insert greater pressures on communist forces and bases elsewhere.

It was responded by the Communists' second counter- encirclement campaign at Shaanxi‚ÄìGansu Soviet (), also called by the communists as the second counter-encirclement campaign at Shaanxi‚ÄìGansu Revolutionary Base (), in which the local Chinese Red Army successfully defended their soviet republic in the border region of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces against the Nationalist attacks from April 1935 to July, 1935. Beginning in October, 1934, Chiang Kai-shek mobilized more than 40,000 troops of warlords of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Ningxia and Gansu to launch the second encirclement campaign against Shaanxi‚ÄìGansu Soviet aimed to eradicate the local communists. However, the nationalist effort was doomed from the start: none of the warlords were willing to sacrifice their own troops and a unified command could not be formed because all were afraid of that the one in charge would sacrifice others. As a result, Chiang Kai-shek at the distant south, hundreds or even thousands miles away, had to take the command, and due to other affairs that needed to be taken care of, as well as the warlords's lack of enthusiasm and cooperation, Chiang was unable to command effectively. It would take half a year since the first mobilization for the nationalists to finally launch their first assault and the disconnection between the battlefields of the nationalist high command had also prevented any timely decision to be made in real time, which would inevitably lead to the eventual nationalist failure of the campaign. In contrast, the communists adopted the correct strategy by concentrating their forces and fought in northern Shaanxi under a unified command. After the 42nd Division and the 84th Division of the Chinese Red Army had met up in Anding (ÂÆâÂÆö) county, a unified command was formed under the name of Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army Northwestern Military Committee Frontline Command. Liu Zhidan (ÂàòÂøó‰∏π) was named as the commander-in-chief while Gao Gang was named as the political commissar. In late April, 1935, the nationalists finally begun their uncoordinated and disorganized attacks, which were easily defeated by the communists. After more than two months of fighting, nationalists not only failed their original objective, but also lost half a dozen towns including Anding (ÂÆâÂÆö), Yanchang (Âª∂Èïø), Yanchuan (Âª∂Â∑ù), Ansai (ÂÆâÂ°û), Jingbian (ÈùñËæπ) and Bao'an (Shaanxi). After suffering more than three thousands casualties, the warlords decided that they'd had enough and called off the any further military operations, and the campaign resulted in communist victory. As a result of their victory, the previous two separate communist bases of the Shaanxi‚ÄìGansu Soviet, the one at the border region of Shaanxi and Gansu and the other in northern Shaanxi had been linked up to become a new one with larger size.

Prelude In February, 1934, nationalists decided to launch an encirclement campaign to eliminate communist Shaanxi‚ÄìGansu Soviet by deploying troops from various units, with the nationalist 86th Division being the principle fighting unit. Majority of the nationalist troops totaling over ten thousands would be deployed to attack the communist base in the border region of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, while the bulk of the nationalist 86th Division would attack the other communist base of Shaanxi‚ÄìGansu Soviet in northern Shaanxi with the help of nationalist security regiment by taking regions including Stability (Anding, ÂÆâÂÆö), Yanchuan (Âª∂Â∑ù), Suide (Áª•Âæ∑), Clear Ravine (Qingjian, Ê∏ÖÊ∂ß), Jia (Ëë≠) county, Wubao (Wubao, Âê¥Â†°), Celestial Wood (Shenmu, Á•ûÊú®) and Prefecture Valley (Fugu, Â∫úË∞∑). Communists, in turn, decided to counter the nationalist encirclement campaign and defend their bases of the Shaanxi‚ÄìGansu Soviet. Order of battle Nationalists (12,500+ total) *2 regiments of the 2nd Regiment of the Garrison 2nd Cavalry Brigade of the 17th Route Army stationed in eastern Gansu *2 regiments of Shaanxi Garrison Cavalry Brigade stationed at Jingbian (ÈùñËæπ), Dingbian (ÂÆöËæπ), and Anbian (ÂÆâËæπ) regions *A regiment of the nationalist 42nd Division stationed at Wealthy (Fu, ÂØå) County *Nationalist 86th Division stationed at Yan'an *Shaanxi Guerrilla Regiment *2 Security Regiments Communists (7,000+ total) *42nd Division of the 26th Army *Guerrillas Shaanxi‚ÄìGansu border region In March, 1934, the communist 42nd Division and guerrilla under the command of Liu Zhidan (ÂàòÂøó‰∏π) left the Southern Ridge (Nanliang ÂçóÊ¢Å) region and went northward behind the enemy line, and reached Triple River (Sandaochuan, ‰∏âÈÅìÂ∑ù) region of Wuqi (Âê¥Ëµ∑) County, directly behind the 2nd Regiment of the Eastern Gansu 2nd Garrison Brigade of the nationalist 17th Route Army. The communists subsequently launched their assaults on the unsuspecting nationalist regiment and after a series battles fought in the regions of Lan Family's Stone Probe (Lanjiabian, Ëî∫ÂÆ∂Á†≠) and Li Family's Ridge (Lijialiang, ÊùéÂÆ∂Ê¢Å), the surprised nationalists lost four companies and the nationalist security regiment was also badly mauled. Before the nationalists could regroup and avenge their defeat, the communists quickly turned south to disengage and seek new opportunities. The communists did not need to wait long for another opportunity. On 11 April 1934, the communist 42nd Division annihilated the 5th Regiment of the nationalist Eastern Gansu 2nd Garrison Brigade, killing over 700 nationalist troops in the region of Xihuachi (Ë•øÂçéÊ±†). In early May, 1935, communists completely annihilated two companies of the nationalist Shaanxi Guerrilla Regiment in the region of Three Miles Source (Sanliyuan, ‰∏âÈáåÊ∫ê) of Chunhua (Ê∑≥Âåñ) County, and the nationalists were forced to deploy eight regiments for another round of offensives after suffering a series of defeats. The communists decided not to engage the superior enemy force and returned to the Southern Ridge (Nanliang ÂçóÊ¢Å) region in the north to wait for other opportunities to annihilate their nationalist adversary. In June, 1934, a detachment of communist 42nd Division went northward to Bao'an (Shaanxi), and defeated a battalion of the 514th Regiment of the nationalist 86th Division, killing more than a hundred nationalist troops in the process in the region of Horse River (Mazichuan, È©¨Â≠êÂ∑ù). After this engagement, the nationalists gave up their attempt to eliminate the communist base in the border region of Shaanxi‚ÄìGansu and concede their defeat. The communist 42nd Division and guerrillas fought over thirty battles and annihilated over three thousand nationalist troops and successfully secured their base in the region. Northern Shaanxi While the battles were raging on in the border region of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces in the south, in northern Shaanxi, local communist guerrillas under the command of Xie Zichang (Ë∞¢Â≠êÈïø), the communist Shaanxi military envoy and commander-in-chief of guerrilla in Shaanxi shocked the nationalists by taking the town of Stability (Anding, ÂÆâÂÆö) on 17 July 1934 and then linked up with the communist 42nd Division went south, with Xie Zichang (Ë∞¢Â≠êÈïø) became the political commissar of the communist 42nd Division. The taking of the town by the poorly equipped communist guerrilla caused the nationalists to redeploy their troops to take back the town, thus opening the way for the communists to escape by removing nationalist troops originally stationed along the way. Taking the opportunity, the communists withdrew northward, with Xie Zichang (Ë∞¢Â≠êÈïø) leading the communist guerrillas and 3rd Regiment of the communist 42nd Division. On 15 August 1934, the communists once again was in Anding (ÂÆâÂÆö) region, and begun to launch their assaults on the nationalists. From 18 August 1934 thru 26 August 1934, three battles were fought in the regions of Jingwujiata (‰∫ïÂê¥ÂÆ∂Â°å) of Stability (Anding, ÂÆâÂÆö) County, Zhang Family's Earth Platform (Zhangjiaketai, Âº†ÂÆ∂Âú™Âè∞) of Clear Ravine (Qingjian, Ê∏ÖÊ∂ß) County, and River Mouth (Hekou Ê≤≥Âè£) Town, and communists scored victory for all of them, completely annihilating two companies of the 515th Regiment of the nationalist 86th Division and badly mauling the nationalist security regiment in the battles. Meanwhile, a battalion of the 514th Regiment of the nationalist 86th Division was also badly mauled by the communists in the regions of Celestial Wood (Shenmu, Á•ûÊú®) and Prefecture Valley (Fugu, Â∫úË∞∑). After suffering a continuous series of defeat, the nationalists were forced to withdraw and called off their first encirclement campaign against Shaanxi‚ÄìGansu Soviet, and the communists declared their victory.

It was met by the Communists' first counter-encirclement campaign at Hubei‚ÄìHenan‚ÄìShaanxi Soviet , also called by the communists the first counter- encirclement campaign against Hubei‚ÄìHenan‚ÄìShaanxi Revolutionary Base Area. The Red Army successfully defended their border region territory against the Government attacks from January to February 5, 1935. Order of battle *Nationalists: (6,500 total): **116th Brigade **126th Brigade **2nd Garrison Brigade *Communists: (2,500 total): **25th Army Situation In late January, 1935, the nationalist 126th Brigade and the 2nd Garrison Brigade occupied regions to the east and to the south of Zhen'an County as they began their encirclement campaign against the local communists. The 25th Army of the Chinese Red Army only number around 2,500 and simply could not face an enemy almost twice its strength. The communists decided to trick the enemy into dispersing its forces and then destroy them by concentrating their own forces. To do so, the communists deployed their forces to the region of the End of Yuan Family's Ditch (Yuanjiagoukou, Ë¢ÅÂÆ∂Ê≤üÂè£) by marching northward from the border region of Shanyang and Yunxi . The communist force subsequently moved to the region of Phoenix Mouth (Fenghuangzui), suddenly appearing directly behind the enemy line. On January 31, 1935, the town of Zuoshui fell into the communist hands, forcing the nationalist 2nd Garrison Brigade to move westward to reinforce the region, thus communists had successfully achieved their objective of dispersing the enemy. On February 1, 1935, as the 252nd Regiment of the nationalist 116th Brigade reached the region of Caiyuyao , it was ambushed by the waiting enemy and one battalion of the 252nd Regiment of the nationalist 116th Brigade completely annihilated while the other two were badly mauled. The communists subsequently withdrew to Gepai Town to rest and regroup. On February 5, 1935, the nationalist commander-in-chief of the encirclement campaign, Liu Yanbiao , the commander of the nationalist 116th Brigade, personally led the 251st Regiment and 248th Regiment of the nationalist 116th Brigade to attack Gepai Town, in attempt to avenge the previous annihilation of the 252nd Regiment of the nationalist 116th Brigade. The communists first checked the nationalist advance at the Wengo Ridge by taking advantage of the terrain, and then launched their counterassault on the front and left flank. After two battalions were completely annihilated by the communist onslaught, the nationalist morale collapsed and the nationalist troops fled southward. This final nationalist defeat marked the end of the first encirclement campaign against Hubei‚ÄìHenan‚ÄìSichuan Soviet. The nationalist defeat in the campaign cost them over 1,200 casualties and in addition, five counties in southern Shaanxi that were originally plagued heavily with communist guerrilla activities had since become communist bases, resulting in the expansion of the communist Hubei‚ÄìHenan‚ÄìSichuan Soviet.

It is primarily known for its service in the American Civil War from April 1861 to May 6, 1864, although it later served in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and World War I (as part of the 106th Regiment). In the Civil War, the regiment was made up of a majority of abolitionists from the Brooklyn area. It was led first by Colonel Alfred M. Wood and later by Colonel Edward Brush Fowler. The 14th Brooklyn was involved in heavy fighting, including most major engagements of the Eastern Theater. Their engagements included the First and Second Battles of Bull Run, the Battle of Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, The Wilderness, and Spotsylvania Court House. During the war, the men of the 14th Brooklyn were well known by both armies and throughout the country for their hard drill, hard fighting, and constant refusal to stand down from a fight. During their three years of service they never withdrew from battle in unorderly fashion. On 7 December 1861, the State of New York officially changed the regiment's designation to the 84th New York Volunteer Infantry (and its unit histories are sometimes found under this designation). But at the unit's request and because of the fame attained by the unit at First Bull Run, the United States Army continued to refer to it as the 14th. The 14th Brooklyn received its nickname, the \\"Red Legged Devils\\", during the First Battle of Bull Run. Referring to the regiment's colorful red trousers as the regiment repeatedly charged up Henry House Hill, Confederate General Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson yelled to his men, \\"Hold On Boys! Here come those red legged devils again!\\" In the early part of the war, when the 14th Brooklyn was in General Walter Phelps' brigade, the brigade was named \\"Iron Brigade\\". It would later to become known as the \\"Eastern Iron Brigade\\" after John Gibbon's Black Hat Brigade was given the name \\"Western Iron Brigade\\". At the conclusion of the war, all members of the \\"Eastern\\" or \\"First\\" Iron Brigade were given medals for their service within the Iron Brigade. Formation and early history of the Regiment The Fourteenth Regiment New York State Militia was officially constituted on 13 May 1847 when the New York State Legislature consolidated individual militia companies into regiments. It was organized on 5 July 1847 with two companies: Company A, the Union Blues, and Company B, the Washington Guards. Companies C to H were organized in February 1848. While the Fourteenth Regiment's purpose was to protect the city of Brooklyn and surrounding areas, in its early history it was more of a social club, where men of venerable lineage could train in military tactics and spend the weekends with other militia-men. The regiment used the armory at Henry and Cranberry Streets as its headquarters. On 4 June 1854, a portion of the 14th Regiment, under the command of Colonel Jesse C. Smith, was called to help suppress a riot caused by an anti-Catholic street preacher referring to himself as \\"the Angel Gabriel.\\" In the so-called Angel Gabriel Riot, the regiment assisted the police in making a number of arrests. In early 1861, the 14th was called several times to the Naval Yard \\"in anticipation of an attack... by Rebel sympathizers\\". In 1860, the United States Zouave Cadets traveling drill team of Chicago, under the command of Colonel Elmer E. Ellsworth, came through Brooklyn. The officers and men of the 14th Brooklyn were so impressed with the drill and uniforms of the drill team that they decided to take on a similar version of the French military uniform known as the \\"Chasseur\\" uniform. This uniform remained their battle dress uniform throughout their term of service in the American Civil War. Brooklyn paid to keep the regiment in this uniform, and it remained one of the few regiments not to don the all blue standard Union military uniform. After the firing at Fort Sumter and President Abraham Lincoln's proclamation for volunteers to suppress the rebellion, the 14th volunteered themselves for a period of three years. Colonel A.M. Wood telegraphed Washington that his regiment was prepared, but New York Governor Edwin D. Morgan refused to send them (apparently for political motives). Colonel Wood then went to Washington and along with Congressman Moses F. Odell explained the situation and as a result, President Lincoln directly ordered the regiment into action. The regiment became a personal favorite of Lincoln. Whenever the President was in the area of the regiment, he would attempt to pay them a visit. He would ask for the 14th Brooklyn to act as his personal guards when in camp or near the battle field. Because of this attention by the President, the 14th Brooklyn was nicknamed \\"Lincoln's Pups\\" or \\"Lincoln's Pets\\", a name the regiment would later shed after the First Battle of Bull Run. President Lincoln gave a speech to them when the regiment mustered out in 1864, thanking them for their fine and honorable service to the United States. The 14th Brooklyn Regiment left New York on 18 May 1861 (except for Companies I and K, which joined it in July 1861), arriving in Washington, D. C. the next day. It was officially mustered into United States service by General Irwin McDowell on 23 May 1861 and initially served at and near Washington. Uniform of the 14th Brooklyn Photograph believed to be Private Alonzo F. Thompson, Company C, 14th Regiment, New York State Militia The typical uniform of a Union Soldier was that of a four-button blue sack coat, light kersey blue wool trousers and a blue cap (bummer, or forage cap). At the beginning of the war both the Union and Confederate armies had a variety of uniforms within their regiments. As the war continued, the Union Army began to standardize the uniform worn by its regiments. By early 1862 most Union regiments were wearing blue. However, Brooklyn paid for and outfitted the 14th Brooklyn throughout the war, keeping them wearing their unique chasseur-style uniform for all three years of their service. The headgear worn by the 14th Brooklyn was a navy blue and red kepi. The top of the cap was covered in dark navy blue and the lower half by a dark red with a band of blue around the bottom of the cap. Upon the front of the cap the regiment had the number '14' and above it was the company designation. On the sides of the caps were New York state buttons holding the chin strap onto the kepi. At the First Battle of Bull Run the 14th were issued havelocks, a white material that fitted over the kepis and had a long piece of cloth that hung down below over the neck. The idea was to catch air and cool the neck of the soldier. The havelocks proved ineffective as headgear, however many were used as bandages on the battlefield. The tunics worn by the 14th Brooklyn were a beautiful combination of red and dark blue adorned with small gold buttons running up and the center of the chest. The tunic was made with a red false vest with 14 buttons closing the vest. Over the false vest was a dark blue shell with 14 buttons on either side of the shell. Some later models of the jacket did away with the false vest and actually sewed the vest into the shell making it a complete jacket. On the jacket were chevrons on the lower arms symbolizing light infantry. Earlier recruits also were issued \\"Shoulder-Knots\\" composed of thick red fabric that were attached with thread on one end and a gold button on the other. The trousers worn by the 14th were very similar to that of the Zouave pantaloons, the only difference being that they were not as baggy as the Zouave pantaloons. The color was a vibrant red color. At the bottom of the trousers the 14th wore gaiters or leggings with seven gold buttons on each gaiter symbolizing the number 14. Sometime in 1862, Colonel E.B. Fowler wrote a letter home commenting on the regiment, a bit about the uniforms, and the tactics in which he had to use. It was later placed in the regimental history. \\"In 1860 the Board of Officers adopted the French 'chasseur' uniform, consisting of ashy red trousers, white leggings, a blue jacket, red chevrons and shoulder knots. A fixed to the head was to be a french style kepi with blue band, red above and blue top. This change of uniform for the regiment was the first in many progressive steps of conformity. Later in early 1861 when the regiment arrived in Washington these improvements were matched by the introduction of the rifled musket and minie ball which took the place of the smooth bore with its round ball and buckshot. A mixture of Gilhams' Militia Tactics and Hardee's translation of the French tactics were substituted for the old Scott \\"heavy infantry\\" tactics as well as its accompaniment of leather stock and pipe clayed belts. Little did the officers of that board dream that the uniform that they then adopted would become historic, sung of in poets' lays and transferred to the artist's canvas as that of the \\"red-legged devils,\\" the Brooklyn Fourteenth.\\" First Bull Run At the First Battle of Bull Run, the 14th Brooklyn was assigned to the First Brigade (commanded by Col. Andrew Porter) in Col. David Hunter's Second Division in General Irwin McDowell's Army of Northeastern Virginia. The Regiment was ordered up to Henry House Hill to reinforce the 1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment and the 11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, the \\"Fire Zouaves\\". These regiments had been ordered to support two batteries of cannon under the command of Captains Charles Griffin and James B. Ricketts on the Union right flank. Before the arrival of the 14th Brooklyn at Henry House Hill, the 11th New York had withdrawn to the Manassas-Sudley Road under heavy assault and then fought off a flank attack from Confederate Colonel J. E. B. Stuart's cavalry. As the 14th Brooklyn moved up the hill, the 11th New York rallied and joined with the 14th to support the guns. Colonel Stuart's subordinate W. W. Blackford wrote this account in his memoir, \\"War Years with Jeb Stuart\\" (from page 28): \\"Colonel Stuart and myself were riding at the head of the column as the grand panorama opened before us, and there right in front, about seventy yards distant, and in strong relief against the smoke beyond, stretched a brilliant line of scarlet - a regiment of New York Zouaves in column of fours, marching out of the Sudley road to attack the flank of our line of battle. Dressed in scarlet caps and trousers, blue jackets with quantities of gold buttons, and white gaiters, with a fringe of bayonets swaying above them as they moved, their appearance was indeed magnificent.\\" The 14th Brooklyn fighting on Henry House Hill. The 14th Brooklyn, 11th New York, and 1st Minnesota were placed into position by Major William Farquhar Barry, McDowell's chief of artillery, at the crest of Henry House Hill. They were ordered to hold their position and assault if the opportunity was there, but were under no circumstances to leave the guns to the Confederates. The three regiments and cannon found themselves confronting the 33rd Virginia Infantry on the left of Confederate General Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's line. Confusion soon erupted on the battlefield in front of them. Thinking the 33rd Virginia, clad in dark blue frock coats and dark blue trousers, were the Union troops supporting the guns, Major Barry ordered Ricketts to hold his fire. This allowed the Virginians to charge the batteries and capture the guns. The 14th Brooklyn, however, rushed up the slope and drove the 33rd Virginia back, recapturing the two guns. The 14th then continued to fire into the left flank of Jackson's line, driving the 33rd Virginia back through the 2nd Virginia Infantry. Under the pressure from the 14th Brooklyn, a large portion of the 2nd Virginia joined the retreating 33rd Virginia and the left of Jackson's line began to collapse. However, Jackson ordered the 4th and 27th Virginia forward. They were joined by the 49th Virginia Infantry, two companies of the 2nd Mississippi Infantry, and the 6th North Carolina Infantry. In hand-to-hand combat the New Yorkers were driven back to the Manassas-Sudley Road and Ricketts' battery and Griffin's two guns captured. The 14th Brooklyn, the 69th New York Militia and 11th New York would charge up Henry House Hill four times, in an effort to recapture Ricketts' and Griffin's cannon. The other two regiments met with little success, but the 14th Brooklyn found gaps and weaknesses in the Confederate lines and exploited them. The 14th Brooklyn briefly took control of the two guns following one charge, only to be routed yet again by the Confederates. The constant charging of the 14th Brooklyn's tactics caught the eye of General Jackson himself. This is when he made his famous statement to his troops: \\"Hold On Boys! Here come those Red Legged Devils again!\\" With that the regiment received its nickname the \\"Red Legged Devils\\". While the 14th Brooklyn and 11th New York Volunteer Infantry were briefly in control of the two guns, the Louisiana Tigers advanced up the hill. The 14th and 11th fired upon the battalion from their superior position, causing significant losses. The Tigers then fired their own rifles, and the majority of the 14th fell to their knees. Encouraged by this, the Tigers dropped their rifles and took out their Bowie knives in an attempt to finish off the survivors. As the Tigers neared the crest of the hill, the 14th Brooklyn stood up. Though both the 14th Brooklyn and the Tigers, who had left their rifles at the bottom of the hill, were poorly trained and lacked real wartime experience, a savage hand-to-hand fight began between the two units. Though the Tigers fought with ferocity and determination, the 14th Brooklyn had the superior field position and eventually the Tigers retreated back down the hill. This brief confrontation permanently made the 14th Brooklyn and the Tigers rivals. 14th Brooklyn Battery Monument, Manassas The efforts of the 14th Brooklyn, however, were in vain, and they were immediately flushed from the position yet again by the powerful Confederate counterattack. The two guns would not be retaken again. As the Confederates launched their strong counterattack, the Union army panicked and fled. They had been startled by the fierce, brutal fighting that the Confederates had brought, it being completely unlike the riot quelling they had performed in the past. It is local legend that the 14th Brooklyn refused to flee with such blind abandon as the rest of the Union army, but rather were ordered off the field, but this has not been corroborated by any contemporary records. During the battle, the 14th Regiment suffered two officers and 21 men killed, 64 wounded, and 30 taken prisoner. Ten of the wounded would die of their wounds. Colonel Wood himself was wounded and captured by the enemy. After the First Battle of Bull Run, the State of New York decided to change the regiment's designation from 14th State Militia to 84th New York Volunteer Infantry. The men of the regiment were displeased and began a letter campaign, joined by the citizens of Brooklyn. Finally the men asked the help of General Irvin McDowell. McDowell spoke to the government and to the regiment's command, and his words bestowed upon the regiment the motto which would follow it throughout history: \\"You were mustered by me into the service of the United States as part of the militia of the State of New York known as the Fourteenth. You have been Baptized by Fire under that number and as such you shall be recognized by the United States government and by no other number\\" Second Bull Run to Antietam The 1st Corps Action in The Cornfield. At Second Bull Run the regiment again fought courageously, losing nearly 120 men. At Antietam, the 1st Division commanded by Brigadier General Abner Doubleday of the 1st Corps began their attack on the morning of 17 September 1862 from the North Woods. Col. Walter Phelps' Iron Brigade fought through the Miller Farm's cornfield. Both Union and Confederate casualties at the cornfield were roughly 6,000. It was at the cornfield that famed nurse Clara Barton went onto the actual battlefield to help the wounded soldiers of the Union Army. According to a report from William Fox of the 107th New York, the brigade that composed of the 22nd New York, 24th New York, 30th New York, 14th Regiment (New York State Militia), and 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters was the first to be called the \\"Eastern Iron Brigade\\" because of its brave fighting at South Mountain and Antietam. Colonel Rufus R. Dawes the commander of the Sixth Wisconsin later wrote in his book \\"Service with the Sixth Wisconsin Volunteers\\": \\"The Fourteenth Brooklyn Regiment, Red legged Devils, came into our line closing the awful gaps. Now is the pinch. Men and officers of New York and Wisconsin are fused into a common mass, in the frantic struggle to shoot fast. Everybody tears cartridges, loads, passes guns, or shoots.\\" In the cornfield, the Eastern Iron Brigade followed the Western Brigade into battle early in the morning. While the rest of Phelp's brigade fell back, the 14th Brooklyn held its ground along with elements of the 6th Wisconsin of the Black Hats (Western Iron Brigade). This effort combined into a mass of soldiers pushing the Confederates up to Dunker Church. These two regiments got further than any other Union Regiment during the attack in the cornfield. Fredericksburg to Chancellorsville At Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville the 14th Brooklyn saw minor action during the major engagements. The regiment was held in reserve and then used for a series of reconnaissance missions to find and assault the Confederate forces in and around the area. It was during this campaign that the Brigade proved that they truly were the \\"Iron Brigade of the East\\" During Chancellorsville the regiment saw a quick but highly deadly action alongside the Sixth Wisconsin Fitz Hugh's Crossing. The 14th held the riverbank as the sixth Wisconsin attempted to cross the river in small wooden boats. It was after this campaign a little before the Battle of Gettysburg that the 14th and all the other regiments in the 1st Corps, 1st Division, 1st Brigade were transferred out. The 14th was transferred to the 1st Corps, 1st Division, 2nd Brigade. Gettysburg to Spotsylvania The 14th Brooklyn was the last regiment of the 2nd Brigade on the road to Gettysburg. The 2nd Brigade were the first Infantry units to fire their rifles and to set foot on the field 1 July 1863. General John F. Reynolds rode up to the 2nd Brigade and urged them onto Gettysburg to support General John Buford's cavalry who were holding the Confederate forces at bay. The 14th dropped its packs on the Emmitsburg road and double quicked across the field that General Pickett's men would on 3 July. The 14th Brooklyn arrived at McPherson's Woods and halted the Confederate advance, until the 1st Brigade of the 1st division arrived. Once the Western Iron Brigade was online, Colonel E.B Fowler saw Confederate forces taking cover in an unfinished railroad cut to his right. He commanded his \\"Demi-Brigade\\" (14th Regiment & 95th NYVI) across the field to meet and clear out Davis' Confederate Brigade. Held in reserve the 6th Wisconsin was ordered to support the 14th regiment and 95th NYVI into the cut. Again the 14th and 6th were together working as they did in earlier engagements. Into the cut the three regiments rushed, supporting each other equally on each other's flanks. One 14th Brooklyn soldier said of the Confederate defense of the railroad cut \\"they fought with the ferocity of wildcats\\" the fight became a brawl of hand-to-hand combat. The Federals who had taken a beating crossing the field in front of the railroad cut had their revenge. The Confederates facing them finally realized their position was a death trap and surrendered themselves to Colonel E.B. Fowler, and handed their Flags over to the 14th Brooklyn. Finally the Confederates were able to wheel artillery down and fire on the 14th's Position in the railroad cut, the 14th marched out of the cut through the town of Gettysburg while the 11th corps came up to support the 1st corps so they could refit. The 14th Brooklyn had the honor of carrying General John F. Reynolds' body from the field into the town of Gettysburg. The regiment continued to fight for the remainder of the battle of Gettysburg. They are the only regiment to possess 3 monuments on the field of Gettysburg - at the railroad cut, at McPherson's woods and on Culp's Hill. The remainder of the fight was had on Culp's Hill on the right flank of the Union army. They were called up to support General Greene who was losing his position to superior numbers. The 14th Brooklyn fought 2 days up there, and Greene later credited the 14th Brooklyn for helping save the entire Union army by saving the flank. In the early hours of 2 July 1863 the 14th Brooklyn was called down to the slope of Culp's Hill. Lt. John J. Cantine, one of General Greene's aides, met the regiment and guided Col. Edward B. Fowler and the regiment to its position on the right of Greene's line. As Cantine led fowler by some trees, a soldier stepped from the darkness and demanded Cantine's surrender. Cantine dismounted from his horse and Fowler drew his pistol, and then there were a dozen or so shots from the woods. Fowler hurried back to the regiment and formed it facing the woods. Fowler then called for volunteers to scout the woods and report back, who may be at his front. Two men, musician John Cox and Sgt. James McQuire of company I, responded and disappeared into the woods or, as one 14th Brooklyn Member recounts \\"in the teeth of flank fire\\", to find out who was there. Cox returned with the word that McQuire had been wounded and that the troops in their front of them belonged to the 10th Virginia Regiment. Colonel Fowler then ordered the regiment to fire a volley and thus charged his regiment into the woods. Hand- to-hand fighting began, and the 14th Pushed the Virginians out of the woods and sent them into a retreat. Lt. Henry H. Lyman who wrote of the regiment in his diary: \\"14th & 147th go among the 12th corps to help drive back the charging rebs. Hot work from 1/2 past 5 to 1/2 past 9. Lie in the pits all night on our arms. No pickett in front.\\" The 14th Brooklyn was called back up the hill after this action being relieved by the 137th Ny. They were there long enough to eat some food and then were immediately sent back down the hill to support the hill once again. Colonel Fowler wrote that when the men entered the trenches \\"they did so without a shout, and the regiment remained there until their ammunition was all but exhausted.\\" He also recounted the casualties taken with the trenches were light but that the colors, which rose above the works, were riddled with bullets, and the staff of the state flag was shot through. On 3 July, the 14th Brooklyn's Position was further up the hill near the 149th New York. When the men of the 149th New York had heard that the 14th Brooklyn were coming down they studied them closely. Prior to this the men of the 149th had heard that the 14th Brooklyn were \\"a bully fighting regiment\\" what they saw were young men with a \\"tidy and smart appearance\\". In Later years the regiment was credited with saving the line and thus saving ammunition trains as well as the flank. The 14th Brooklyn Fought for another year, through the Battle of the Wilderness campaign and Spotsylvania. They finally mustered out in May 1864. The recruits who signed up and joined the regiment in 1862 were moved over to the 5th New York Veteran Volunteer Infantry Regiment. However, the recruits who went over to the 5th New York Veterans (Duryea Zouaves)wore their 14th Brooklyn uniform and formed their own company in the 5th. The regiment mustered out at Fulton Ferry on 25 May 1864 to huge crowds who welcomed the regiment home after 3 years of service. During its 3 years in service the regiment sustained 717 casualties, nearly 41% of its men.

DeBevoise Captain-Brevet Major Isaiah Uffendill After the American Civil War Chickamauga Park in Georgia 1898 Since the regiment's return from the battlefields of the American Civil War, the 14th was twice involved in service, first during the quarantine disturbances at Fire Island in September 1892, and throughout the Brooklyn motormen's strike in January 1895. The 14th was one of the few regiments selected in General Orders, No.8, General Headquarters, State of New York, dated Adjutant General Office, Albany, 27 April 1898, to enter United States Military service. At that time the regiment consisted of ten companies. Upon receiving this order the regiment began recruiting to fill these companies as well as organize two additional ones. The 14th Regiment, Infantry, New York Volunteers was mustered into the service in May 1898 take part in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The regiment was in Federal service for only four months and was detailed to camp service. The 14th did not reach the front lines, but made preparations for duty in Cuba, and the soldiers were in a \\"fine state of organization\\". All of the 14th's officers and men were anxious to be involved the real fighting on the front lines, but this movement was deemed unnecessary by the government after considerable thought. On 1 May, the regiment was ordered to camp at Hempstead, Long Island New York. The regiment then reported to Major General Charles F. Roe, who was in command of the National Guard. The 14th then mustered into service as follows: Companies A, G, K, and M on 13 May; the rest of its companies on 16 May. On 17 May, the regiment left Hempstead and proceeded by rail to Camp George H. Thomas, Chickamauga, Georgia. The regiment arrived and was assigned to the First Brigade, First Division, Third Army Corps on 29 May. On 5 September, the 14th Infantry received orders to muster out on corner of Eighth Avenue and Fifteenth Street, Brooklyn at the armory. The men of the 14th left Anniston on 14 September and arrived in Brooklyn on 16 September. In 1893, the Eighth Avenue Armory was constructed for the regiment. They were mustered out United States service on 27 October 1898. The regiment entered the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War as the 14th New York Infantry and many sons of veterans who fought during the American Civil War with the 14th Brooklyn enlisted with the 14th New York Infantry. Following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, 14th New York Infantry troops reinforced the 106th Infantry and fought in World War I. Legacy of the Red Legged Devils Following the conclusion of the war, members of the 14th Regiment New York Veterans Association continued to hold monthly meetings. Several battlefield memorials were erected over time. Today members of reenactment units do the same to preserve the honor and memory of the 14th Brooklyn.

It was met with the Communists' second counter-encirclement campaign at Hubei‚ÄìHenan‚ÄìShaanxi Soviet (, also called by the communists the second counter-encirclement campaign at Hubei‚ÄìHenan‚ÄìShaanxi Revolutionary Base Area / ). The local Red Army successfully defended their territory in the tri- provincial border region from February 1935 to April 18, 1935. Order of battle *Nationalist **115th Brigade **2nd Garrison Brigade **3rd Garrison Brigade **local security forces *Communists **25th Army of Chinese Red Army Background After their defeat in the first encirclement campaign against the Hubei‚ÄìHenan‚ÄìShaanxi Soviet, the Nationalist Government immediately regrouped and launched their second encirclement campaign in the hope of not leaving their communist enemy enough time to rest, regroup and recover. The Nationalists deployed the veteran unit of the first encirclement campaign, the 2nd Garrison Brigade, as the force to chase the enemy main force. The Nationalist 115th Brigade and Garrison Regiment stationed at Lantian (ËìùÁî∞, Bluefield), Shanyang (Â±±Èò≥) and Shangxian (ÂïÜÂéø, Merchant County) were also mobilized to attack the town of Gepai (ËëõÁâå). Engagement The campaign begun in mid-February 1935 with the Nationalist attack on the town of Gepai. The 25th Red Army, no match for their Nationalist adversary which enjoyed both numerical and technical superiorities, decided to withdraw south to Yunxi in the modern-day municipal region of Ankang. While on their retreat, the Communists took the county town of Ningshan and Foping, completely annihilating the defending forces. On March 8, 1935, Communist forces took Huayang town (ÂçéÈò≥Èïá) of Yang County. The Nationalist 2nd Garrison Brigade, in close pursuit, reached a point east of Huayang at the same time. Two days later, to the town's southeast, the Communists ambushed the Brigade at Shitasi (Áü≥Â°îÂØ∫, Stone Tower Temple); five battalions were completely annihilated, over six hundred Nationalist troops were KIA, and over five hundred guns were captured. The nationalist commander Zhang Feisheng (Âº†È£ûÁîü) was wounded but successfully escaped with his life, but the nationalist 2nd Garrison Brigade was forced out of action as a result of the defeat. In late March the Communist 25th Army returned to the modern municipal region of Shangluo, camping between Lantian and Gepai towns. Although the Nationalist 3rd Garrison Brigade at Zhashui (ÊüûÊ∞¥) and ZhenAn (ÈïáÂÆâ) county-towns could not stop their communist adversary, it did manage to follow closely. However, on April 9, 1935, the Nationalist 3rd Garrison Brigade was ambushed by the communists near Jiujianfang (‰πùÈó¥Êàø, Nine Houses), south of Gepai. Two regiments were completely annihilated, more than a thousand Nationalist troops were taken prisoner - including the brigade commander Zhang Hanmin (Âº†Ê±âÊ∞ë). Riding on their victory, the communists took the county town of Luonan (ÈõíÂçó) on April 18. Results With more than three fifths of their deployed force now out of action after continuous defeat, the Government army was forced to call off its second encirclement campaign against the Hubei‚ÄìHenan‚ÄìShaanxi Soviet. Taking advantage of their victory, the Communists further consolidated their position in Luonan (ÈõíÂçó) and Shanyang (Â±±Èò≥) counties, and in the towns of Wuxing (‰∫îÊòü, Five Star), Zhenzuo (ÈïáÊüû) and Yunxi (ÈÉßË•ø). The Red regular force climbed to 3700 by May, and a 2,000 member strong guerrilla force was established as well. The base area was centered around Gepai and Caojiaping (ÊõπÂÆ∂Âù™, Cao family plot). Uniquely in the history of 20th-century Chinese encirclement campaigns, this second Government defeat did not result in any further large-scale attacks against its target. Instead, in their next encirclement campaigns, nationalist took a more prudent method of setting a blockade against the communist base. The reason for the rather conservative approach was because Chiang Kai-shek was worried about something much more serious: the potential link up of Mao Zedong's main force and the local Red force in the communist base. As a result, a majority of the nationalist force deployed in the next campaign was concentrated in the south, acting as a blockade between Mao's force and the local Red force. The weak nationalist blockade on the north would eventually enable the local Reds to escape in the following campaign to join their comrades in the Shaanxi‚ÄìGansu Soviet. The Red's temporary survival here meant that the Hubei‚ÄìHenan‚ÄìShaanxi Soviet would have an important role to play in succoring the troops soon coming into Shaanxi from their various Long Marches.

Publication history Lunatik first appeared in Defenders #51 (September 1977), though a later retcon identifies him as an incarnation of Arisen Turk, a character who appeared in Creatures on the Loose #35-37 (May-September 1975), which was written by David Anthony Kraft and pencilled by George P√©rez. According to Kraft, he had been trying to link Lunatik to the Creatures on the Loose story arc during his time as writer on Defenders, and his successor Ed Hannigan picked up on this, but made a different connection between the two than Kraft had had in mind. Keith Giffen stated, \\"Lunatik was a character I came up with in high school. When it went radically wrong, I went to DC [Comics and] took the basic concept of Lunatik and ... split [it] into two characters: Lobo had his mercilessness, and Ambush Bug had his goofiness.\\" The character was created and designed in a hurry, when Giffen suddenly left Marvel to work for DC Comics. The character subsequently appears in Defenders #51-53 (September-November 1977), #55-56 (January-February 1978), #61-62 (July-August 1978), #64-65 (October-November 1978), Marvel Premiere #45-46 (December 1978, February 1979), and Defenders #70-73 (April-July 1979). A different character named Lunatik appeared in Marvel Comics Presents #172-175 and Lunatik #1 (December 1995). Fictional character biography Arisen Tyrk was the tyrannical god-king of the dimension called Other Realm. He seeks the power of the Godstone, which is bonded to John Jameson as the Man-Wolf. Tyrk hires Kraven the Hunter to attack Man-Wolf, but Man-Wolf fights Kraven off. Rebels from Other Realm bring the Man-Wolf to their land and he deposes Tyrk. Tyrk tries to escape through an extra-dimensional portal, but the portal is damaged and fragments Tyrk into a number of forms in a number of realms. Four of Tyrk's fragments go to Earth, becoming the crazed Lunatik. These four duplicates of Tyrk plague the Defenders until they re-merge Lunatik into a more-or-less-whole Tyrk. He fights the Defenders in this form, but they eventually defeat him. For a time he poses as drama professor Harrison Turk at Empire State University. Other characters named Lunatik There is also a cosmic mercenary by the name of Lunatik. He kills one of Tyrk's fragments, claiming that he doesn't like anyone else \\"using his name.\\" He first appeared in Marvel Comics Presents #172 (Jan 1995). This Lunatik is seen on a prison ship, the Dredge 01, on its way to the Kyln. It crashes on Earth with Drax the Destroyer, Paibok, and the Blood Brothers as the only survivors. He seemingly meets his end at the Destroyer's hand.Drax The Destroyer: Earthfall #1-4 This Lunatik or a possible fragment appeared (in another prison) as Dirty Wolff in Deadpool.

It was originally published in the magazine Thrilling Wonder Stories in August 1949, under the title \\"The Naming of Names\\". It was subsequently included in the short-story collections A Medicine for Melancholy and S is for Space. The story takes place in the near future on Mars, as is the case with many of Bradbury's stories. Plot summary In the midst of a war on Earth, a rocket port in New York sends a few colonists to establish a village on Mars. The Bittering family, (father Harry and mother Cora and their children Dan, Laura, and David), arrives as part of the few colonists chosen for the first wave. Harry is initially disquieted by the Martian environment, but they take comfort in the fact that the family can return to Earth when resupply ships arrive. Strange events begin to affect the life brought as part of the settlement effort, including the seeded grass sprouting purple, the family cow growing a third horn in the middle of its head, and other anomalies with the vegetable garden. Harry's discomfort on Mars increases and the thought of returning to Earth on the next resupply mission soon becomes his only comfort, much to the concern of Cora. This comfort is taken away as Bittering is informed that the war has led to an atomic bomb devastating New York City and destroying the only spaceport capable of supporting travel to Mars. Resolving to build himself a rocket home, Harry isolates himself from his family and the townsfolk, who have begun to show signs of transforming into Martians as their limbs and bodies elongate, their irises become shimmery gold, their skin darkens. One night, Iorrt, the Martian word for Earth, comes into his head, even though he never learned it anywhere. Harry staves off the transformation as he only consumes food and water brought from Earth, but the supplies run out and he is forced to eat Martian food to survive. Soon enough, Harry notices his eyes have turned gold. Cora convinces Harry that a family swim in the canals of Mars would do him good to relax, and he hesitantly agrees. While there, their eldest son, Dan, requests to be referred to by the Martian name Linnl. Harry and Cora, now almost entirely Martian, agree easily, and the other two children quickly adopt Martian names as well. As they return to the town, the Bitterings discover that the colonists are retreating to the ancient Martian villas in the mountains, as the summer has made the valley stiflingly hot. Harry briefly expresses a wish to stay and work on his rocket but is easily persuaded to go with the rest of the colonists and come back when the weather is cooler. Five years later, the United States, having won the war and rebuilt New York, sends a small military dispatch to recover the colonists sent to Mars, only to find their settlement abandoned. The soldiers instead encounter a large Martian settlement in the mountain villas, where the native Martians are pleasant and have a remarkable affinity for English. Convinced they had nothing to do with the original colony's disappearance, the group agrees to attempt a second, larger settlement using the town built by the first.

The computer comes with a full QWERTY keyboard with 55 keys, separate EDIT, 3 SHIFTS, double RESET, DEL, separate comma and full stop keys. It has the possibility to switch between Latin and Russian fonts. It has built in Kempston Interface and cursor keys that works as a joystick as well. It has no edge connector and video output is RGB on a 5-pin DIN (same as the Pentagon) or on an 8-pin DIN (for connecting to HERCULES or EGA monitor), no composite video and all I/O ports are 5- and 7-pin DINs. Inside the case there is a male 64-pin connector you can map to the standard edge connector. An interesting fact is that the hardware contained about 3 to 4 grams of gold and almost 18 grams of silver. The letters on the keyboard was written using cool laser beam technology. The buttons didn't use copper or iron contact plates, but Reed switches. When writing the screen memory to TV/monitor screen the writing does not begin not from the left top of border. It begins from border right under paper. This means that most multicolor effects and such don't work correctly. Errors in the ROM have been fixed and also Cyrillic letters were inserted. This also meant some games didn't work. The keyboard matrix is extended from 5 keys in 8 rows to 5 keys in 9 rows to allow more buttons. You could do a reset by pressing two reset buttons. The Robik came in four versions with only minor changes for Russian Internationalization and localization. The hardware remained unchanged except that cheaper and cheaper parts was used for each version, but the 4th version was new with a single IC. This version didn't sell well because by then it was mostly hardware enthusiasts that bought the Robik and this design didn't allow modifications.

He is the head of Studio Fuksas in partnership with his wife, Doriana Mandrelli Fuksas, with offices in Rome, Paris and Shenzhen.  Biography  Rome Convention Center \\"La Nuvola\\" Fuksas was born in Rome in 1944; his father was Lithuanian Jewish while his Catholic mother was the daughter of a French father and an Austrian mother. At the beginning of the 1960s, he worked for Giorgio De Chirico in Rome. After he left Italy and worked for a period for Archigram in London, for Henning Larsen and for J√∏rn Utzon in Copenhagen. He received his degree in architecture from the La Sapienza University in 1969 in Rome, where he opened his first office in 1967, the GRANMA, collaborating with his first- wife Anna Maria Sacconi. From 1985 he has worked in partnership with his second wife, Doriana Mandrelli, who graduated in Architecture in Paris in 2007. Subsequent offices were opened in Paris (1989) and Vienna (1993), Frankfurt (2002) and Shenzhen, China (2008). Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport's new Terminal 3, which his firm designed and built 2008-2013 (with parametric design support by the engineering firm Knippers Helbig), is an outstanding example for the use of parametric design and production technologies in a large scale building. Fuksas had two daughters with Doriana Fuksas: Elisa and Lavinia. From 1994 to 1997 he was a member of the urban commissions of Berlin and of Salzburg. For many years he has dedicated his special attention to the study of urban problems and in particular to the suburbs. From June 1997 he was advisor to the I.F.A. (Institut Fran√ßais d'Architecture) Administration Board. Since January 2000, he writes the architecture column of the weekly publication L'Espresso, established by Bruno Zevi. In 2000 he was (somewhat ironically in light of his practice of employing unpaid interns for periods up to two years) the Director of The Venice Biennale's - 7th International Architecture Exhibition - \\"Less Aesthetics, More Ethics\\". He is visiting professor at several universities, including the √âcole sp√©ciale d'architecture in Paris, and Columbia University in New York.

While several houses were leveled, no one was injured or killed by the tornado. A home in the town was swept clean off of its foundation, justifying the F5 classification. This makes it one of the strongest twisters on record since 1999 and one of only nine to reach F5/EF5 intensity between 1999 and 2011 in North America. This tornado was part of a two-day outbreak of severe weather through June 23, including at least four other tornadoes confirmed in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Because Environment Canada adopted the Enhanced Fujita scale in 2013, there will be no more tornadoes with an F5 rating, making this tornado the first and last confirmed F5 tornado in Canada.Assessing tornado damage: EF-scale vs. F-scale Tornado track The tornado touched down north of the Trans-Canada Highway around 6:30 PM CDT (2330 UTC) and slowly moved southeast where it picked up a tractor-trailer before it headed south and severely damaged the town's flour mill causing over $1 million in damage. It then headed southeast towards Elie, where it destroyed four houses, flipped cars, and even tossed one homeowner's Chrysler Fifth Avenue onto a neighbour's roof.Reported on page B1 in the Windsor Star, Windsor, Ontario, June 23, 2007 The tornado lingered over the same area of Elie for approximately four minutes before it cut sharply to the south and rapidly dissipated. The tornado traveled about and was wide at its widest during its 40-minute lifespan. The tornado repeatedly struck essentially the same area of town, destroying most of the structures and vehicles in the area. The people in Elie were prepared and took the necessary precautions during the event. A video of the tornado shows an entire two-story home swiped off its foundation and tossed in the air before rotating around the tornado and then being obliterated. Also seen on the video was a three- quarters-of-a-ton GM van filled with drywall picked up and tossed hundreds of feet. At least 3 houses are seen being destroyed on the video, with many more being damaged as well as vehicles, and the mill is seen being damaged, with bins and roofs being destroyed there. At the same time as the Elie tornado, another tornado was touching down close to nearby Oakville. That tornado was rated as an F3 with winds of after it destroyed several outbuildings and many trees. Two tornadoes not far from each other at the same time was a rare occurrence for the people watching the events unfold that evening. The following day, Environment Canada sent out a storm damage survey team from the Prairie and Arctic Storm Prediction Centre to assess the damage caused by the tornado. On September 18, 2007, the tornado was upgraded to F5 on the Fujita scale from the original F4 based on video analysis of the tornado and reassessment of the damage. This was the first tornado in Canada to be officially rated as such, making it the strongest confirmed tornado in Canadian history. It was one of only two F5/EF5 tornadoes that year (the other being in Greensburg, Kansas on May 4, 2007), and there have only been nine confirmed since 1999. At the time, Canada had not adopted the Enhanced Fujita scale.  Weather conditions prior to the tornado Funnel cloud that would produce the Elie tornado. The synoptic situation on June 22 was conducive to a major severe weather event in southern Manitoba. A low pressure system came in from Saskatchewan through the day, and then moved over southern Manitoba throughout the evening. A warm front was positioned north of Elie for much of the day with a trailing cold front residing west of Elie near the Lake Manitoba basin southwest through southeast Saskatchewan. A lake breeze boundary was also present south of Lake Manitoba. Very warm air was situated over Southern Manitoba that day as temperatures climbed into the high 20s ¬∞C (low 80s ¬∞F). The humidity was also uncomfortably high, with dewpoints ranging from . Strong wind shear was present, reflected in high helicity values. These conditions were favourable for supercells, which are thunderstorms with rotating updrafts, and they developed within the warm sector located in the Red River Valley and areas farther west. The situation was exacerbated by the presence of the lake breeze boundary because the atmosphere was capped through much of the day with little in the way of a trigger. This boundary provided the focus for storms to develop rapidly and become severe, given the high instability present.

Robinson, Inc.; launched on 7 August 1941; sponsored by Mrs. John McLennon; delivered to the Navy on 6 July 1941; modified for naval service and outfitted by the Boston Navy Yard; and commissioned there on 15 October 1941, Ens. John E. Johansen, USNR, in command.  World War II service  On 27 October, the coastal minesweeper departed Boston, Massachusetts, on her way to Yorktown, Virginia. She arrived at her destination on the 30th and conducted training out of the Mine Warfare School. At the conclusion of her training, she reported to the Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, for duty. She was assigned initially to Submarine Squadron (SubRon) 1 at New London, Connecticut, where she began duty late in November. About a month later, Brambling was reassigned to the 3d Naval District and began patrol and minesweeping operations from the Montauk Section Base.  Assigned to the Caribbean  After repairs at the New York Marine Basin early in March 1942, the minesweeper sailed on 15 March bound for duty in the Panama Canal Zone. Voyaging via Norfolk, Virginia, Charleston, South Carolina, Miami, Florida, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Brambling reported to the Commandant, 15th Naval District, at Coco Solo in the Canal Zone on 9 April. On 16 May 1942, Brambling was placed out of commission and then was placed in service as a district craft. The minesweeper spent the remainder of World War II patrolling the waters of the 15th Naval District.  End-of-war deactivation  In October 1945, she received orders to Charleston for inactivation. She reported to the Commandant, 6th Naval District, on 22 October. Brambling was finally placed out of service on 12 February 1946, and she was laid up in the Wando River with the Charleston Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

Based on the semi-autobiographical 1984 novel by Marguerite Duras, the film details the illicit affair between a teenage French girl and a wealthy Chinese man in 1929 French Indochina. In the screenplay written by Annaud and G√©rard Brach, the 15 1/2-year-old protagonist is portrayed by actress Jane March, who turned eighteen shortly after filming began. Her lover is portrayed by actor Tony Leung Ka-fai. The film features male and female nudity.(The Lover) (1992) Production began in 1989, with filming commencing in 1991. The film made its theatrical debut on 22 January 1992, with an English release in the United Kingdom in June and in the United States in October of the same year. The film was nominated for the 1992 Academy Award for Best Cinematography and won the Motion Picture Sound Editors' 1993 Golden Reel Award for \\"Best Sound Editing ‚Äî Foreign Feature\\". At the 1993 C√©sar Awards in France, the film was nominated for seven awards, and won the Award for Best Original Music. The film was a box office success, and received mostly positive reviews from the general audience along with mostly negative reviews from American critics. Overall, the film's performances and cinematography were generally praised.  Synopsis  The primary characters are known only as the Young Girl and the Chinese man. The events take place in Vietnam. The daughter of a bitter, fearful, poverty-stricken French family, living in a rural area, the girl is a pretty waif who wears an old linen dress and a fedora, and paints her lips bright red when out of her mother's sight. Her weak-willed, widowed mother is a schoolteacher to local children. There is a violent, opium-smoking older brother, and a timid younger brother. The girl is a loner but an excellent student, who dreams of being a writer. The girl meets the Chinese man when crossing the river on the ferry to return to the city after a school holiday. He is the son of a businessman whose fortune was made in real estate, and has recently returned from Paris after finishing his business studies. He has the look but lacks the self-assurance of the playboy he fancies himself to be, and he is mesmerized the first time he sees her standing by the rail on a crowded ferry crossing the Mekong River. After some awkward conversation, she accepts a lift to Saigon in his chauffeur-driven limousine. In voice-over at the beginning of the film she says she is 15, but she tells him she is 17; he is 32. During the drive he tremulously takes her hand; at the end, his hand is in her lap. The following day, he waits for her outside her boarding school and takes her to the room in the Chinese quarter that he uses for entertaining mistresses, and they have sex. They realize that \\"a future together is unthinkable\\" because she is scheduled to return to Paris soon, and he is to make an arranged marriage with a Chinese heiress. Aware of the limited time they have together, they fall into a relationship in which they shed all responsibilities that come with commitment. Every day after school, the girl goes to his room. The girl's family discovers the affair, and though at first furious, they condone it because the man is wealthy and can pay off some of their debts. Despite this added tension, the affair continues passionately. The man even goes so far as to beg his father for permission to be with her instead of entering into his arranged marriage, but his father would rather see him dead than with a white girl. Though devastated, the man marries his arranged bride, and the girl boards a ship days later to return to France. Decades later, she has become a successful writer. In the final scene, she tells us that the Chinese Man is visiting France and has telephoned her. He tells her that he has never stopped loving her, and never will.  Cast  * Jane March as The Young Girl * Tony Leung Ka-fai as The Chinaman * Fr√©d√©rique Meininger as The Mother * Arnaud Giovaninetti as The Elder Brother * Melvil Poupaud as The Younger Brother * Lisa Faulkner as Helene Lagonelle * Xiem Mang as The Chinaman's Father * Philippe Le Dem as The French Teacher * Ann Schaufuss as Anne-Marie Stretter Soundtrack Production  While adapting the Marguerite Duras novel into the film's screenplay, director Jean- Jacques Annaud and fellow writer G√©rard Brach changed the age of \\"The Girl\\" from 15¬Ω to 17 before deciding that they would have her reveal in the beginning that she is 15 and to lie to her lover saying she is 17, but tried to maintain the original structure and literary tone of the original novel. As with the Duras novel, none of the characters use names and are referred to in the credits as \\"The Girl\\" and \\"The Man\\". To find the actress who would play the girl, Annaud advertised in multiple cities in the United States and the United Kingdom, visited drama schools, and watched television. However, it was his wife who came upon 16-year-old British model Jane March's photograph in a teen fashion magazine and brought her to his attention. When filming began 14 January 1991, March was two months away from turning 18. Annaud first flew to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam in 1989 to view the original novel's setting, but was greatly disappointed at the state of the country. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, he stated that the \\"best colonial hotel\\" offered \\"rats as big as this running through the corridors, spiders everywhere, and no air conditioning, of course. When we tried to use the sink, three drops of brown water‚ÄîI presume from the Red River‚Äîcame out of the faucet.\\" He initially decided against filming in the country, and began scouting locations in Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, all countries that have been used as settings to represent Vietnam in other Western films. A year later, he returned to his original choice, feeling no other country could truly represent the \\"tired museum\\". According to Annaud and MGM studio, it was the first Western film to be shot in the country since the reunification of the country in 1975. The government welcomed the crew, providing them with a governmental helicopter for use during filming. However, the filmmakers were required to clear all production storyboards with officials before they could be filmed, and an official remained on set at all times. All of the film's sexual scenes had to be shot in Paris as they could not be filmed on location. It took 135 days to complete filming, and due to the importation costs of shooting in Vietnam, the film cost $30 million to produce.  Release  After its completion, the film was first screened in Saigon where it was well received by the \\"morally minded\\" guests. The Lover debuted theatrically in France on 22 January 1992. Its first English release came in the United Kingdom 19 June 1992. The film was licensed for release in the United States by MGM Studios, but for its theatrical debut, it first had to get past opposition by the Motion Picture Association of America. The organization gave the original film an MPAA rating of NC-17. MGM appealed after cutting three minutes of the film. Coupled with pleas from Annaud, MGM, and a sex educator who argued that the cut version was no more illicit than the 1992 sexual thriller Basic Instinct, the film's rating was changed to R. It hit American theaters on 30 October 1992. The uncut version of the film was released to Region 1 DVD on 11 December 2001 with audio tracks in English and French and subtitles in English, French, and Spanish. The Lover was released on Blu-ray in Germany in 2011 under the title Der Liebhaber. It is not region locked and comes with subtitle and audio tracks available in German and English. It received a FSK ab 12 freigegeben rating.  Reception  The film was a box office success in France taking in 626,891 admissions its opening weekend, playing in a total of 229 theaters. In total the film received a total of 3,156,124 admissions in France, becoming the seventh-highest-grossing film of the year. The Lover grossed $4,899,194 in box office receipts in the United States when given limited release to 103 theaters. It was nominated for the 1992 Academy Award for Best Cinematography and won the 1993 Motion Picture Sound Editors' Golden Reel Award for \\"Best Sound Editing ‚Äî Foreign Feature\\". At the 1993 C√©sar Awards in France, it was nominated for seven awards, winning in the category of Best Original Music for Gabriel Yared's score.  Critical response  Vincent Canby of The New York Times praised the film, calling it \\"something of a triumph\\" and a \\"tough, clear-eyed, utterly unsentimental\\" film that was \\"produced lavishly but with such discipline that the exotic locale never gets in the way of the minutely detailed drama at the center.\\" He also complimented the performances of Tony Leung and Jane March, noting she is \\"wonderful\\" and a \\"nymphet beauty\\" in her film debut. The staff of Variety praised Leung's performance as well, writing that he \\"is excellent as the shiftless scion whose love for the girl makes him emotionally naked and vulnerable.\\" David Ansen of Newsweek wrote: \\"The Lover's rarefied sensibility takes getting used to; once its spell is cast, you won't want to blink.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times compared the film to Emmanuelle or the Playboy and Penthouse erotic videos, \\"in which beautiful actors and elegant photography provide a soft-core sensuality. As an entry in that genre, The Lover is more than capable, and the movie is likely to have a long life on video as the sort of sexy entertainment that arouses but does not embarrass.\\" He continued, \\"Is The Lover any good as a serious film? Not really. Annaud and his collaborators have got all of the physical details just right, but there is a failure of the imagination here; we do not sense the presence of real people behind the attractive facades of the two main actors.\\" Desson Howe of the Washington Post observed, \\"Director Jean-Jacques Annaud and adapter Gerard Brach provide more than a few effective moments . . . But the story is dramatically not that interesting. After establishing the affair and its immediate problems, Lover never quite rises to the occasion. Scratch away the steamy, evocative surface, remove Jeanne Moreau's veteran-voiced narration, and you have only art-film banalities.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly graded the film C, calling it \\"one more movie that titillates us with the prospect of taking sex seriously and then dampens our interest by taking it too seriously. Why do so many filmmakers insist on staging erotic encounters as if they were some sort of hushed religious ritual? The answer, of course, is that they're trying to dignify sex. But sex isn't dignified ‚Äî it's messy and playful and abandoned. In The Lover, director Jean-Jacques Annaud gives us the sweating and writhing without the spontaneity and surprise.\\" In the United Kingdom, Channel 4 noted \\"the nameless characters bring to mind Last Tangos search for identity through passion, and there's a shade of Ai No Corridas intensity. But there is none of the substance that made those two films such landmarks of their genre, and while March and Leung are an attractive pair, the glossy look and aloof direction of the film leaves you cold.\\" The critic for Time Out London thought its \\"sombre quality dignifies an otherwise shoddily directed movie\\" that is \\"basically a melancholic piece about the remembrance of times, places and passions lost.\\" He felt the role of the Young Girl was \\"altogether too complex for the inexperienced March to do more than simply embody.\\"  References  External links   * Category:English-language films Category:Vietnamese- language films Category:1990s erotic drama films Category:British films Category:French films Category:Vietnamese films Category:Erotic romance films Category:Films about interracial romance Category:Films about sexuality Category:Films directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud Category:Films based on French novels Category:Films based on works by Marguerite Duras Category:Films set in the 1920s Category:Romantic period films Category:Films set in the French colonial empire Category:Films set in Saigon Category:Films shot in Vietnam Category:Vietnamese multilingual films Category:French multilingual films Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:Films about virginity Category:Films scored by Gabriel Yared Category:French erotic drama films Category:British erotic drama films Category:Films produced by Claude Berri Category:Films with screenplays by G√©rard Brach Category:Vietnamese historical drama films Category:English-language French films Category:1990s multilingual films Category:Fiction set in 1929 Category:1992 drama films Category:1992 films ","title":"The Lover (1992 film)"},{"id":"13332411","text":"Willowood is a subdivision found in unincorporated Harris County, Texas, United States in the Northwest Park area next to State Highway 249, and Beltway 8 and south of the Willowbrook area of Houston, west of Inwood Forest in Houston, and north of Acres Homes in Houston.

Regarded as \\"one of the most distinguished clinical neurologists and medical scientists of his generation,\\" he died in a car accident in Adjud, Romania, having visited a neurological clinic in Bucharest earlier the same day.  Early life and family  John Newsom-Davis was born in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, the eldest child and only son of Kenneth Newsom-Davis, the managing director of the Davis Gas Cooker Company, and his wife Eileen, a doctor's daughter. He had a twin sister, Julia. He was educated at Sherborne and Pembroke College, Cambridge. During his two years national service in the RAF (1951‚Äì53), he qualified for full pilot training, and learned to fly Meteor jet fighters. In 1963 he married Rosemary Elizabeth Schmid, an English Swiss, who later became an educational psychologist, working in child development. They had two daughters and a son, and (at the date of his death) seven grandchildren.  Career  Newsom-Davis qualified MB BChir in 1960 at the Middlesex Hospital, and then joined Tom Sears at the National Hospital, Queen Square. After studying the physiology of breathing there, he spent a year at the Cornell Medical Center, New York City, working with Fred Plum on the central pathways involved in breathing. On returning from New York in 1970 he was appointed consultant neurologist jointly at the National and at the Royal Free Hospital. At the latter hospital he built up an active research group, becoming the first MRC Clinical Research Professor in 1980. In 1987 he was recruited to the Action Research Chair of Clinical Neurology at Oxford University, with a Fellowship at St Edmund Hall, bringing with him most of his research team from the Royal Free. At Oxford not only did he build up clinical neuroscience in his own field of immune-mediated and genetic diseases, he also established a Centre for the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain, which was recognised as a world leader. In 1997 he succeeded Ian McDonald as editor of the Neurology Journal Brain, making it one of the first scientific journals to go online. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1973, a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1991, and awarded a CBE in 1996. In 1997 he received the Ellison-Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine. His achievements were recognised internationally in his honorary membership of the American Academy of Neurology and his election as a foreign member of the Institute of Medicine of the United States National Academy of Sciences.  Retirement  After his \\"retirement\\" from Oxford in 1998, he continued to edit Brain until 2004 and to hold a weekly myasthenia clinic, as well as honouring many invitations to lecture abroad. He also took on the huge task, together with the National Institutes of Health in the United States, of organising and funding a multi-centre trial (over 80 centres) to determine whether thymectomy is an appropriate treatment for myasthenia gravis.

She soon enrolls in Llanview University studying law, where she befriends Kevin Buchanan, who had recently gained custody of his infant son Duke. Rachel and Kevin eventually begin a romantic relationship; their romance falls apart in 1993 as Kevin is wrongly accused of being a participant in the gang rape of Marty Saybrooke, a case in which Hank is the prosecutor, and Nora is the defense counsel for one of the suspects, Todd Manning. In 1995, Rachel's law studies falter, and she develops a dependency on prescription drugs, using her relationship with Dr. Ben Price to forge prescriptions. Feeling the pressure needing to live up to the reputation of her parents, her addiction advances to illegal drugs; Rachel obtains heroin from a drug dealer who works for her uncle, R.J. Gannon. Soon realizing that Rachel has a drug problem, R.J. stages an intervention, and Rachel checks herself into St. Anne's for rehabilitation. She later escapes, and the family eventually tracks her to New York City, where she is mixed up in drugs and prostitution. During the family strife, the question of Rachel's paternity is raised when R.J. reveals he and Nora had a one-night stand before she married Hank; it's eventually confirmed that Hank is her father, and Rachel mends her relationship with her parents. Rachel recommits herself to recovery and begins working in the music business alongside her uncle R.J., then befriends T√©a Delgado, only for T√©a to fall in love with her old enemy Todd. When Nora is in need of an assistant in late 1997, Rachel recommends Georgie Phillips, an old friend from law school. Upon taking the job, Georgie meets Nora's husband Bo Buchanan, who she develops a psychotic fixation on. Georgie becomes obsessed with stealing Nora's life and taking Bo for herself, alleging that she and Bo have been having an affair. During an angry confrontation with Rachel in the spring of 1998, Georgie grows increasingly unhinged, assaulting her and threatening Nora's life. Rachel bludgeons Georgie to death in self-defense, then attempts to cover up her crime, and stays silent as Todd is fingered for the murder. When Todd unearths the truth and traps most of Llanview at the Buchanan family lodge, Rachel confesses. Nora is desperate to keep her daughter from going to jail, but Rachel has resigned herself to serving her time. Rachel is convicted of manslaughter and sent to Statesville Prison for a brief prison term; after her release, she moves back to Chicago and becomes involved in social work. She visits Llanview several times in the early 2000s, including when Nora was believed to be dead, and for her wedding to Daniel Colson. Rachel returns to Llanview on April 7, 2009 after her half-brother Matthew Buchanan is paralyzed in a car accident. Though she is working as a drug counselor in Chicago, Rachel announces her plans to stay in town indefinitely, and accepts a local counseling job. Her first client is Cole Thornhart, her mother's former ward and Marty's son, who had been responsible for Matthew's accident. Rachel guides Cole through his arduous recovery, then begins a romance with bodyguard Shaun Evans. She quickly deduces that her mother is still in love with Bo and not with Clint, whom she eventually marries. Shaun tells Rachel he loves her, as he goes into surgery following his shooting, he then falls into a coma. Rachel is left guilt-ridden as she kissed Greg and was planning on breaking up with Shaun. She and Shaun then end their relationship and Rachel succumbs to her attraction for Greg and they begin dating. Unfortunately for Rachel and Greg, the two broke up in March 2010 when Greg thought Rachel was having feelings for her friend Schuyler Joplin (which she doesn't) and walked out on her. Feeling she doesn't have anything left in Llanview, Rachel moved back to Chicago to help a friend who is a patient in rehab. When her mother remarries Bo, Nora chooses Rachel as her maid of honor. However, Rachel informs her mother that she will be un-able to attend the ceremony because she will be stuck in Chicago.

He then played collegiately for Northwestern University, 1964‚Äì67, where he led the team in scoring all three seasons, was both All-American and Academic All-American in 1967, was All-Big Ten and Academic All-Big Ten in 1966 and '67, and is still Northwestern's 12th all- time scorer, 3rd in scoring average, 10th in both field goals and free throws made, and 6th in points in a game (40).

While in private practice, he was also active in Democratic politics, running unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor of Illinois in 1990. In 1992, he was appointed the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. His investigations of and prosecutions for political corruption gained him public recognition and popularity. It has also been claimed that those same things antagonized many powerful Democrats, so that his 1998 campaign for governor was not strongly supported. Despite his popularity and the Republicans' admission that he was the candidate they most feared, Burns finished a distant fourth of six candidates. In April 2000, Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White appointed Burns as his inspector general, a position he still holds.

He is best remembered for his work, the Lausiac History; he was also, in all probability, the author of the Dialogue on the Life of Chrysostom. He is considered a Saint in the Coptic Church.https://susoccm.org/about/patron-saint Palladius was born in Galatia in 363 or 364, and dedicated himself to the monastic life in 386 or a little later. He travelled to Egypt to meet the prototypical Christian monks, the Desert Fathers, for himself. In 388 he arrived in Alexandria and about 390 he passed on to Nitria, and a year later to a district in the desert known as Cellia, from the multitude of its cells, where he spent nine years, first with Macarius of Alexandria and then with Evagrius Ponticus. At the end of the time, his health having broken down, he went to Palestine in search of a cooler climate. In 400 he was ordained bishop of Helenopolis in Bithynia, and soon became involved in the controversies which centred round St. John Chrysostom. The year 405 found him in Rome, whither he had gone to plead the cause of Chrysostom, his fidelity to whom resulted in his exile in the following year to Syene and the Thebaid, where he gained first-hand knowledge of another part of Egypt. In 412‚Äì413 he was restored, after a sojourn among the monks of the Mount of Olives. His great work was written in 419‚Äì420 and was called the Lausiac History, being composed for Lausus, chamberlain at the court of Theodosius II. He died some time in the decade 420‚Äì430.
