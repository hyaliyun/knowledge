American Anthropologist, Volume 11, p. 728. (, also Bergischer Dreiklang or Bergische Bauweise) is a type of timber framed house that is widespread in the German region of Bergisches Land. Typical of its timber framed post construction are the green window shutters (Schlagläden in the local dialect), white door lintels and window frames combined with black frame work and white plaster infill, as well as grey-black slate façades and/or rubble stone plinth. A stone staircase often leads to the front door. The slate façade serves to protect the infill or nogging against the weather and was either applied on the side facing the prevailing wind or on all four sides, depending on the status and wealth of the owner. The slates bear witness to the regional relationship of the houses with the geological unit of the Rhenish Massif, known as the Rhenish Slate Mountains (Rheinisches Schiefergebirge). On the farmhouse variant (by contrast with the otherwise identical, but slightly larger small town variant), the green timber framed door, with its stable door design (separate upper and lower door), is another feature of the Berg house.  Bergisch architecture and the heritage conservation movement  Around 1900, as part of the heritage conservation movement (Heimatschutzbewegung), attempts were made to collect, preserve and promote examples of what was seen as Bergisch architecture. This was not just based on the rural farmhouse type, which also occurred in the villages in a smaller version, but also typical Bergisch buildings like Schleifkotten (\\"grinder's cottages\\"), Hammerkotten (\\"hammersmith's cottages\\") or the Bleicherhaus (\\"bleaching house\\"). In Bergisch towns, with the exception of the Rhenish parts of the former Duchy of Berg, 2½ to 3½ storey houses built in the period from 1750 to 1850 with features in the Late Baroque/Rococo and Empire styles, heavily dominated local architecture. In 1903, this particular type was proposed and promoted as a prototype to the Bergisch Historical Association (Bergischer Geschichtsverein) by curator of monuments, Paul Clemen, because it seemed more appropriate to contemporary needs. It was only an option in new residential areas on the outskirts of towns, however, because, in the town centres, houses, 4½ to 5½ storeys high, had already been built. At the same time \\"Bergisch Rooms\\" (Bergische Stuben) were created, where traditional furniture was collected and exhibited. Advocates of Bergisch architecture for industrial buildings were Otto Schell and Friedrich Wilhelm Bredt.  Examples  * Baden Museum  References   Literature  * R.

He is known for his fine engravings of natural history subjects, especially those illustrating books by John Walcott and the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant. He created almost 600 engravings in his career. He also exhibited paintings of landscapes and of flowers. He exhibited at the Society of Artists and at the Royal Academy. Life and work Print of engraving Eagle Tavern and Coffee House in The Strand, London by Peter Mazell after ? William Miller, c 1780. Mazell is believed to have been the son of Pierre Mazell (d. 2 March 1787) and Catherine Rocque (d. 7 September 1788), Huguenots living in Dublin, Ireland. He lived in central London, with addresses in Tottenham Court Road (1769), Paddington (1770–80), Portland Street (1783), Gerrard Street (1790), Covent Garden (1791) and St. Pancras (1797). In 1761 he exhibited a landscape painting at the Society of Artists in London, and worked in London for the rest of his career. Most of his subsequent exhibits between then and 1791 were prints of his engravings on copperplate; these included views of country scenery such as The Upper Lake of Killarney, 1770 as well as numerous views of London and other cities. His landscape and natural history engravings are considered extremely crisp and neat. However, not everybody liked his work; the Dutch provincial governor Joan Gideon Loten complained of the \\"bungling engraver Mazell\\" for his work on two engravings of what was then called the \\"Ceylon Tailorbird\\", and referring to the plate of another bird, the red-faced malkoha, \\"made so dirty by the pityable engraver Mazell\\". Mazell often worked on natural history illustrations for books by Thomas Pennant, using paintings of birds by Peter Paillou in The British Zoology (1766), History of Quadrupeds (1781) and Arctic Zoology (1784–1785). He also illustrated some of Pennant's travel books including Tour of Wales, 1778. As well as works by Pennant, Mazell illustrated books by John Boydell in 1763; Charles Cordiner's Remarkable Ruins and Romantic Prospects of North Britain in 1792; and Captain James Cook's Voyages. At least occasionally, he continued to paint as well as to make engravings: he exhibited two flower paintings at the 1797 exhibition of the Royal Academy of Arts. Holt Castle by Mazell, Peter, 1779 Mazell's engravings are of paintings by many artists including Charles Cordiner; Moses Griffiths; John Webber; Rowland Omer; Philip Thicknesse; the natural history artist Desmoulins; Samuel Rawle; Richard Holland; William Miller; Jonathan Fisher; Thomas Snagg; James \\"Athenian\\" Stuart; Christian Georg Schütz; Paul Sandby; John Watts; the equestrian painter George Stubbs.

MOGS is a transmembrane protein found in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells. Biologically, it functions within the N-glycosylation pathway.  Enzyme mechanism  MOGS is a glycoside hydrolase enzyme, belonging to Family 63 as classified within the Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme database. This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction: : Exohydrolysis of the non-reducing terminal glucose residue in the mannosyl- oligosaccharide glycan Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 This reaction is the first trimming step in the N-glycosylation pathway. Prior to this, the glycan was co- translationally attached to a nascent protein by the oligosaccharyltransferase complex. MOGS removes the terminal glucose residue, leaving the glycoprotein linked to Glc2Man9GlcNAc2, which can then serve as a substrate for glucosidase II. The oligosaccharide substrate for MOGS  Substrate Specificity  MOGS is highly specific to the oligosaccharide in its biological substrate in the N-glycosylation pathway. Eukaryotic MOGS does not cleave simple substrates such as p-nitrophenyl glucose, and it also shows no activity to the α(1→3) linkage present at the terminus of Glc1-2Man9GlcNAc2. Furthermore, the minimum substrate is the glucotriose molecule (Glc-α(1→2)-Glc-α(1→3)-Glc), linked as in its native Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 substrate. Kojibiose, the disaccharide Glc-α(1→2)-Glc, acts as a weak inhibitor on plant, animal, and yeast MOGS. MOGS also acts to lesser extent on the corresponding glycolipids and glycopeptides.

The first officer was 24-year-old Chirag Kalra, and Indian national who joined the airline and had 1,200 flight hours, with 973 of them on the Boeing 737. Investigation The Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) published a preliminary report on 15 May 2013. Flight data showed that the aircraft continued to descend below the Minimum descent altitude (MDA), which is AGL. The report found that at AGL, the first officer reported that the runway was not in sight. At approximately AGL, the pilot again stated he could not see the runway. Flight data showed that the pilots attempted to perform a go-around at approximately AGL, but contacted the water surface moments later. The captain’s go around decision came far too late. The bare minimum altitude for a 737 go around is 15 m, as 9 m of altitude is lost when executing the manoeuvre.http://www.cockpitchatter.com/final-report-lion-air- flight-904-pilot-error/ There has been no indication that the aircraft suffered any mechanical malfunction. A final report was published in 2014. In January 2017, Budi Waseso, the chief of Indonesia's national narcotics agency, said that the pilot of Lion Air Flight 904 was under the influence of drugs at the time of the accident, and had hallucinated that the sea was part of the runway. That claim is at odds with the statement made after the accident by Indonesia's transport ministry, which said the pilots had not tested positive for drugs. The NTSC concluded that the flight path became unstable below minimum descent altitude with the rate of descent exceeding 1000 feet per minute. Analysis of the pitch angle versus engine power based on the flight data recorder \\"indicated that the basic principle of jet aircraft flying was not adhered during manual flying.\\" The flight crew lost situational awareness and visual references as the aircraft entered a rain cloud during the final approach below minimum descent altitude. The Captain’s go-around decision and execution was conducted at an altitude which was insufficient for it to be executed successfully. The pilots were not provided with timely and accurate weather information considering the weather around the airport and particularly on final approach was changing rapidly.

The estate passed from the Cooke family to the Guise family and, in the mid-19th century, was purchased by a member of the Gambier-Parry family. Renovations were undertaken during the tenures of the Guise and Gambier-Parry families, with the latter also including extensive development of the grounds. The Gambier-Parry family held the estate until the late 20th century. History Highnam Court (pictured) is a 17th-century, Grade I listed building in Highnam, Gloucestershire, just north of the A40. The country house was built in 1658 for William Cooke, the son of Sir Robert Cooke, following damage to the original structure in the English Civil War. Following William Cooke's death in 1703, the estate was inherited by his son Edward Cooke. The latter was succeeded upon his death about 1724 by his son Dennis Cooke. After Dennis Cooke's demise in 1747, Highnam Court was inherited by his sisters. The manor underwent improvements of its interior in the 18th century for owner Sir John Guise, 1st Baronet, the son of one of Dennis Cooke's sisters. Further alterations were made in the early 19th century for his son and successor, Sir Berkeley William Guise, 2nd Baronet. Following his death in 1834, his brother, Sir John Wright Guise, was heir to the estate. Thomas Gambier-Parry purchased the estate from Guise in 1838. Architect Lewis Vulliamy renovated the house for him in 1840 and 1855. Changes included the construction of a single-story wing across the rear of the manor, as well as the extension of a service wing which dated to the early 19th century. Further renovations by David Brandon in 1869 were also performed on behalf of Gambier-Parry, and included a billiard room. Thomas Gambier-Parry died in 1888; his widowed second wife Ethelinda Lear retained the manor until her demise in 1896. She was succeeded by her husband's son, the youngest child of his first marriage, composer Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry. Upon Parry's death in 1918, his half-brother Major Ernest Gambier-Parry succeeded to the estate. After the major's death in 1936, the estate passed to his one surviving son, Thomas Mark Gambier-Parry, who resided at Highnam Court until his death in 1966. During the Second World War, Highnam Court was commissioned on 28 April 1941 as an overspill centre for navy recruits, and defined as a tender to HMS Ganges.Warlow, Ben, Shore Establishments of the Royal Navy, Liskeard : Maritime, 2000. pp.62–3. On 31 January 1942 operations at Highnam Court were transferred to HMS Cabbala. About 1950, Thomas Mark Gambier-Parry made a gift of the farms of the estate to his cousin, W. P. Cripps. Thomas Mark Gambier-Parry was succeeded by his cousin, Thomas Gambier-Parry's great- grandson, Thomas Fenton, who inherited Highnam Court as a teenager. Before his death in 2010, Fenton gave documents related to the administration of the estate, covering the period from 1650 to 1940, to the Gloucestershire Archives. Ownership of the manor was transferred in 1977; Gloucester businessman Roger Head later became the owner of Highnam Court in 1994, serving as High Sheriff in 2015-16. Recent improvements to the house include the construction of an orangery, an addition at the west side of the house, which was finished in 2001. While the house remains privately owned, the gardens are opened to the public periodically throughout the year. The orangery is also sometimes utilised for public exhibition space or provision of refreshments. Design The south and east sides of Highnam Court demonstrate a nine by five bay plan. The architectural style of the manor is Artisan Mannerism. The south facade of the house was originally the site of the front entrance to the manor. However, when Thomas Gambier-Parry purchased the estate in 1838, he reversed the functions of the south and north sides of the house. He built a portico on the rear of the manor and redirected the driveway there, such that the north side of the house became the entrance. His alteration of the layout resulted in the south side of the manor having unobstructed views of the gardens and adjacent lake. The exterior is of brick with contrasting ashlar trim, stone quoins, and some artificial stone. The hipped roof is slate. The nine-window, symmetric south facade is two and a half storeys and features a five-window, slightly recessed centre section. The entrance is centrally positioned, with a pair of French doors and a plain, semicircular fanlight. The baroque surround includes a keystone and bilateral stone columns with swags and fruit. There are four windows on either side of the south entrance; each is six-paned, with the centre panes the widest. On the next floor, the windows have twenty panes. Over the entrance, there is a stone niche containing the statue of a female figure. It is believed that the statue of Oliver Cromwell as Hercules that is in the alcove in the east garden was originally in the niche. There are five dormer windows, the four outer dormers each with sixteen panes. The fifth, central dormer window has twenty panes. The north side of the house includes a one-storey wing with the orangery to the west and billiard room to the east, as well as the service wing which is set far back to the west. The north facade features a portico to the left, with Ionic columns. The interior of the manor has a double-pile plan, with panelled shutters over the windows of the main rooms on the ground floor and the rooms at the south facade on the first floor. There are mahogany doors to the corner rooms on the ground floor. The music room and billiard room both feature marble fireplaces. In the gold room, a marble buffet and mirror face a marble fireplace. The plaster ceiling has figures of a lion, eagle, dolphin, and phoenix at the corners of the room, and is an example of the \\"fine rococo plasterwork\\" in the house. In the central room along the south side (garden side) of the house, there are two fireplaces, with carved surrounds. The green room to the left, also along the south side of the manor, has a marble fireplace as well. The main stairs are of the 18th century; the cantilevered stone staircase has iron balusters. An older staircase has stone for the first four treads, but wood for the steps above that level. Four additional fireplaces are present on the first floor. Gardens Winter garden terrace In the 18th century, Sir John Guise not only made improvements to the interior of Highnam Court; he also landscaped the grounds. During the mid-19th century reversal of function of the north and south sides of the manor, an Italianate terrace was built along the south side. The grade II listed south terrace was the work of architect Vulliamy in 1843, and includes a balustrade, urns, and steps. Thomas Gambier-Parry began to lay out his gardens in 1840 with the assistance of James Pulham and, less than four decades later, they were among the loveliest in the United Kingdom. However, during most of the 20th century, the gardens were neglected and became overgrown. Restoration of the gardens commenced in 1994, after Roger Head became the owner. The Pulhamite winter garden, installed between 1849 and 1862, includes grottos, rock gardens, and waterfalls, and was planted with evergreens and ferns. The east garden, which was first installed in 1869 as a formal flower garden, required vigorous pruning of the Irish yews more than a century later. The garden, replanted annually, is underplanted with bulbs which bloom in the spring. A new, potager-style kitchen garden was planted in 2001. The orangery parterre, just southwest of the orangery at the west side of the manor, was planted in 2001. Boxwood hedging surrounds topiary evergreens, roses, lavender, and spring-blooming bulbs. Restoration of the rose garden required the use of 19th-century photographs. While less ornate than the 19th-century rose garden, the restored garden had arches installed along the rose garden broad walk in 2004. The rose beds were enlarged, to create a more dramatic vista. A wisteria walk was planted in 2004 to serve as the entrance to the winter garden terrace. The wisteria walk includes a limestone sculpture by artist Mat Chivers. The winter garden terrace, also known as the ladies winter walk, is located along the south wall of the main walled garden, southwest of the manor. The wall is divided into sections by vermiculated columns of Pulhamite. At one time, statues were positioned between the columnar yews that run along the terrace. However, the statues were vandalised. New statues of reconstituted stone depict the four elements; obelisks by Robert Bryant are also new additions. An old clematis arch at the winter garden terrace has been restored. The orangery knot garden to the west of the house was finished in December 2004, and includes variegated boxwood hedging and a statue of Mercury, the Winged Messenger. One of the most recent additions to the gardens at Highnam Court is a meadow garden. In addition to the Grade I listing of the manor, Highnam Court park and garden are Grade II* listed, and multiple individual structures in the garden and estate are Grade II listed.

He previously served as Ollanta Humala's Minister of Defense from July 2012 to April 2015, and Prime Minister from April 2015 to July 2016. Born in the capital city of Lima in 1958, Cateriano pursued a law degree at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, specializing in constitutional law. During his brief term in the Peruvian Congress between 1990 and 1992, Cateriano attained a prominent role as a ranking member of the congressional investigative committee on Alan García's first administration (1985-1990). Alongside Lourdes Flores and Fernando Olivera, the committee was ultimately disbanded following García's acquittal by the Supreme Court in March 1992. Cateriano published in the following years a detailed work on the investigation. After a failed run for the Peruvian Congress, Cateriano worked extensively in opposition to Alberto Fujimori's presidency, ultimately being appointed to the Constitutional Reform Advisory Body of the Ministry of Justice in the presidency of Valentín Paniagua. Subsequently, he was appointed under Alejandro Toledo's presidency as Deputy Minister of Justice, serving until his resignation in June 2002, alongside minister and former colleague, Fernando Olivera. During the presidency of Ollanta Humala, Cateriano served as Minister of Defense from July 2012 to April 2015. In his almost three-year tenure, he remained a controversial member of Humala's administration, constantly clashing with the opposition regarding the government's modus operandi, in which First Lady Nadine Heredia seemingly interfered with government decisions. He also faced criticism for his support of pecuniary sanctions on voluntary military service enrollment, which the Constitutional Court declared the measure unconstitutional. Upon the resignation of Ana Jara on 2 April 2015, due to her censorship by the Peruvian Congress regarding illegal government espionage under her management as Prime Minister of Peru, Cateriano was appointed as her successor. Seemed by pundits as a government loyalist, he served through the end of Humala's presidency. Cateriano was sworn as Prime Minister of Peru on 15 July 2020, succeeding Vicente Zeballos as the government faces strong criticism due to Vizcarra's management of the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru. He would serve until 4 August 2020, less than three weeks in office, as Congress voted against his confirmation. Early life and education Cateriano was born in Lima on 26 June 1958. He is the son of Pedro Cateriano Delgado, from Arequipa, and Clara Bellido Delgado. His great-uncle, Army colonel Andrés Neptali Cateriano y Alcalá, served as Minister of War and Navy during the government of José Pardo y Barreda. Upon finishing his high school education at the Colegio de la Inmaculada, from which he graduated in 1975, Cateriano entered the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, where he studied law. He also has doctoral studies at the Ortega y Gasset University Research Institute, attached to the Complutense University of Madrid, specializing in constitutional law. His professional experience covers legal, pedagogical, business and political areas. Career Cateriano entered the political scene as he was slated for a seat in the Peruvian Congress for Lima with the Liberty Movement, the only political party in which he has been registered, led by Mario Vargas Llosa, serving from 1990 to 1992, which was dissolved by President Alberto Fujimori. During his parliamentary tenure, Cateriano was a member of the Constitution and Foreign Relations committees, and the Permanent Assembly of Congress. He gained prominence as member of the Investigative Committee of the First presidency of Alan García, alongside Lourdes Flores and Fernando Olivera. In his published work The García Case, Cateriano details said investigation, the same that motivated Congress to accuse García of illicit enrichment (for issues such as that of the BCCI and the Mirage aircraft), but which the former president was initially declared innocent by the Supreme Court in 1992, and when reopened they were never resolved judicially, until they finally prescribed.Cateriano Bellido, 1994, Ausonia. Following the dissolution of Congress in 1992, Cateriano was invited by Fernando Olivera to regain his seat in the new unicameral body at the 1995 general election, but was not elected, attaining a low share of votes nationally. Upon the inauguration of Valentín Paniagua as President of Peru in November 2000 following the downfall of Alberto Fujimori, Cateriano was appointed to the Advisory Commission of the Ministry of Justice for Constitutional Reform. Simultaneously, he represented Peru before the Committee of Experts of the Follow-up Mechanism of the Inter- American Convention against Corruption. In July 2001, Cateriano was appointed as Deputy Minister of Justice by President Alejandro Toledo. He served in the ministry under the management of Fernando Olivera until June 2002. After ten years dedicated extensively to the private sector between 2002 and 2012, Cateriano was appointed agent of the Peruvian State before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in February 2012, for the Chavín de Huántar case, defending the government's version that there were no executions during the release of the hostages from the residence of the Japanese ambassador in 1997. Minister of Defense Cateriano was appointed Minister of Defense on 23 July 2012, under cabinet led by Juan Jiménez Mayor, succeeding congressman José Antonio Urquizo in the position. At the start of his tenure, Cateriano declared his interest in promoting of voluntary military service, although the Constitutional Court declared that the draw for military service was not unconstitutional. =Controversies= On 14 July 2013, a Peruvian journalistic program revealed a telephone recording in which Cateriano tells an interlocutor that First Lady Nadine Heredia, gave him the \\"green light\\" to make some purchases for the Defense sector through the United Nations Development Programme. The dialogue revealed to the local press an alleged interference of Ollanta Humala's wife in government decisions; however, Cateriano argued that Heredia only \\"transmits the president's messages\\". An expert report from the National Police of Peru stated that the audio is inaudible in various parts and would have been edited. The Prosecutor's Office twice closed the investigations into an alleged arms purchase. The United Nations Development Programme ultimately ratified Cateriano's version. In December 2012, the Executive Branch issued Legislative Decree 1146, which modified the Military Service Law, and established in its article 50 that \\"those chosen by lottery are required to appear within the indicated period\\" for the selection process; that those who are selected are obliged to appear within the indicated period to join the quartered service and that the draws with serious and permanent physical or mental disabilities, those deprived of their liberty, those who prove to be responsible for the maintenance of the home, the university students, who prove they are providing some voluntary service to the community and residents abroad. The Constitutional Court later ruled that the draw was not contrary to the Constitution. This within the framework of the powers granted by the Legislative to the Executive to legislate in matters of Defense and Interior. In this regard, members of the opposition harshly questioned the aforementioned decree for discriminating against the poorest and for making the Military Service \\"mandatory\\" for those who cannot pay this amount (approximately US $ 720). Congress debated that said provision promoted by Cateriano was illegal, since being a voluntary service, a pecuniary sanction cannot be imposed on those do not wish to do so. First Premiership (2015-2016) On 2 April 2015, President Ollanta Humala appointed Cateriano as Prime Minister after his predecessor, Ana Jara was censured for spying against lawmakers, reporters, business leaders and other citizens. As part of the presidential transition from Humala to Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Cateriano resigned as Prime Minister on 28 July 2016. Second Premiership (2020) On 15 July 2020, President Martín Vizcarra announced the recomposition of his government amidst the criticism of Vicente Zeballos' management of the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru. Cateriano accepted Vizcarra's invitation to form a new cabinet, and was sworn in as Zeballos' successor. A few days earlier, Cateriano had resigned to the advisory body of the congressional Constitution Committee following Congress' harshly criticized amendments to the Constitution regarding immunity for public officials. Following his oath of office, Cateriano met with the congressional leaders Manuel Merino and Luis Valdez Farías, in order to request a vote of confidence for his ministerial cabinet before July 28 - a request that was not it would grant him, until August 3 - and discuss public affairs in the context of the health emergency caused by the new coronavirus.https://gestion.pe/peru/politica/pedro-cateriano-solicito- formalmente-al-presidente-del-congreso-sustentar-voto-de-confianza-antes- del-28-de-julio-nndc-noticia/%3foutputType=amp On August 4, this request was rejected with 54 votes against, 37 in favor and 34 abstentions.

Their centre of power lay in Harad in Central Tihama of Hajjah in Yemen, due to Zaydi expansion in Hajjah the Sulaymanids sphere of influence was concentrated in Northern Tihama & Asir which was previously counted to Yemen known as Al-Mekhlaf Al-Sulaymani (The Sulaymani region). However, the region became part of Saudi Arabia since the 1934 The Sulaymanids adhered initially to Ismaili Shiism and later to the Sunni branches of Islam. Expulsion from Mecca The chronology of the history of the dynasty is not very well established. Their name is derived from Sulayman bin Abdallah, a fifth- generation descendant of the imam Hasan bin Ali. The clan lived in Mecca at the time when the Sulayhid dynasty extended its influence in Yemen and into Hijaz to the north. In 1061 the last amir of Mecca of the old Musawi line died. Now the Sulaymanid clan attempted to dominate the city by violent means. The following years were unsettled and the traditional gate-keepers of the Kaaba, the Shabi clan, appropriated all the gold and silver in the religious premises. The disturbances served as a pretext for King Ali as-Sulayhi to intervene. He performed the hajj in 1063 with a large retinue and restored order in Mecca. The sharifs asked Ali as-Sulayhi to instal one of their kin as amir and then leave the holy city.Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje, Mekka, Vol. I, The Hague 1888, p. 61-2. The king appointed the sharif Abu Hashim Muhammad as lord in Mecca, starting the Hawashim line of sharifs in the city. However, the Sulaymanid headman Hamza bin Wahhas felt that his own line had been slighted.His line of descent is: Hasan bin Ali - Hasan - Abdallah - Musa - Abdallah as-Salih - Sulayman - Da'ud - Abu Fatiq Abdallah - Abd ar-Rahman - Abu Tayyib Da'ud - Wahhas - Hamza bin Wahhas. See Eduard de Zambaur, Manuel de généalogie et de chronologie de l'histoire de l'islam, Hannover 1927, Table A. A conflict resulted and Hamza bin Wahhas was driven out of Mecca in about 1063 or 1069.According to the historian Ali ibn al-Athir part of the sharifs arrived to Yemen by AH 455 (1063), but other sources indicate that Hamza bin Wahhas resisted the Hawashim faction until AH 461 (1069); see Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje, Mekka, Vol. I, The Hague 1888, p. 63. He then moved to Yemen and established a base in the northern part of the coastal lowland where the family ruled as amirs. The era of the Sulaymanids thus overlapped with a number of Yemeni dynasties: the Sulayhids, Hamdanid sultans, Rassids, Najahids, Zurayids and Mahdids.G. Rex Smith \\"Politische Geschichte des islamischen Jemen bis zur ersten türkischen Invasion\\", p. 140 Defeat and revenge The chronicles give relatively little information about the Sulaymanids and tend to mix them up with the Rassids of Sa'dah. It is established, however, that they held a certain authority in the northern Tihama and were involved in the affairs of the more powerful slave dynasty of the Najahids in Zabid. The Sulaymanid sharifs observed a vassal relation to the rulers of Zabid and paid 60,000 dinars per year in tribute. Hamza's son Yahya bin Hamza assisted the Najahid ruler Jayyash when the latter defeated the Sulayhid general Saba in 1077. In the next generation Ghanim bin Yahya involved in the internal politics of the Zaydiyyah polity of the northern highlands in 1117.G. Rex Smith, The Ayyubids and early Rasulids in the Yemen, Vol. I, London 1974, p. 54. In about 1132 or 1134 he meddled in a civil war between the Najahid wazir Surur and the ambitious slave Muflih. He moved towards Zabid with 1,000 cavalry and 10,000 infantry and joined forces with Muflih but was defeated at al-Mahjam. Muflih died soon after the defeat, and the wazir of Ghanim managed to make peace with the court at Zabid.H.C. Kay, Yaman: Its early medieval history, London 1892, pp. 114-5. Some decades later the dynasty was attacked by a new and belligerent dynasty, the Mahdids, who had recently appropriated Zabid on the fall of the Najahids. The amir Wahhas bin Ghanim fell in battle against the Mahdid lord Abd an-Nabi in 1164. The Sulaymanid defeat was complete and their lands were acquired by the victor. The activities of the Mahdids in Yemen was one of the reasons for the Ayyubid ruler Saladin to dispatch an army against South Arabia under his brother Turan Shah. Wahhas bin Ghanim's brother Qasim, eager to exact revenge for the recent defeat, gladly allied with the Ayyubids and joined his remaining forces with them. The Ayyubid invasion was successful and led to the conquest of the most of Yemen in 1173–1174. With these events, however, the autonomous position of the Sulaymanids came to an end. Qasim died soon after the elimination of the Mahdids.G. Rex Smith, The Ayyubids and early Rasulids in the Yemen, Vol. I, London 1974, p. 55. Local Sulaymanid lords are mentioned in the chronicles later on as vassals under the Ayyubid dynasty. As late as 1556 the Sulaymanid sharifs held sway locally.H.C.

It was formed in April 1943 on the basis of three guards rifle divisions, which had distinguished themselves in battle to break through the Siege of Leningrad – the 45th, 63rd and 64th (the last came from the Volkhov Front). So the corps was a Guards unit from the first day of its formation. N. P. Simonyak, who had received for Operation Spark the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, was appointed as commander.

Red Cossacks of Ukraine. Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia. History The creation of Red Cossacks was first declared on in Kharkiv by Vitaly Primakov who previously participated in the October Revolution and was among those who stormed the Winter Palace in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg). He also participated against the Kerensky–Krasnov uprising. The formation of the military unit continued until 9 February 1918. In the beginning after announcing the formation, the military unit was joined by soldiers of former 3rd battalion of 2nd Ukrainian Reserve Regiment (300 individuals) who were disarmed by revolutionary detachments (1st Moscow Revolutionary Regiment headed by Pavel Yegorov) from Soviet Russia. The newly announced military unit also included local Red guards (400 individuals) of several Kharkiv factories such as Kharkiv Locomotive Factory (now the Malyshev Factory), the General Electric Company (, Vseobshchaya kompaniya elektrichestva) and the Helfferich-Sade Association. With time, Red Cossack detachments were established where Soviet power was declared including Kharkiv Governorate, Poltava Governorate, and Kyiv Governorate. The formations were established voluntarily and composed out of workers and peasants predominantly Ukrainians, but also contained other ethnic representatives (Russians, Jews, others). Sister of Yuriy Kotsiubynsky, Oksana was in charge of agitation and propaganda and chief editor of Red Cossack newspaper \\"To arms\\" (). On the People's Secretariat of Ukraine issued its decree about organization of People's Revolutionary and Socialist Army in Ukraine, the Red Cossacks. At first in January 1918 the regiment as part of the Soviet 4th Revolutionary Army took part in advance against the troops loyal to Central Council of Ukraine and then in fought against the advance of German and Ukrainian forces in March–April 1918 (following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk). On 1 March 1918 soldiers of the 1st Horse Regiment of Red Cossacks attempted to rename their regiment to the 1st Workers-Peasants Socialist Regiment of the Red Army. After that the regiment was \\"cleansed\\" from non-Ukrainian element by Soviet government.

As part of the Army Group of Kyiv direction in May 1919 participated in suppression of Nikifor Grigoriev rebellion and in July–September 1919 fought against armies of Anton Denikin (Armed Forces of South Russia). In August 1919 the regiment was expanded into brigade that was part of 12th and 14th armies of the Workers and Peasants Red Army (RKKA). In October 1919 it expanded further into the 8th Cavalry Division of Red Cossacks which in November of same year conducted a raid across the Denikin's Army rears. In April 1920 battled in the Northern Taurida Governorate against the Pyotr Wrangel's troops. Soon after the Polish- Ukrainian union treaty of Warsaw in 1920, the division participated in the Polish–Soviet War. During that campaign it reached the city of Stryi, but during a retreat of the Red Army, it was encircled and partially destroyed at Zbruch River.

History The Fairfield Aviation General Supply Depot was constructed on 40 acres (160,000 m2) in 1917 on land purchased by the Army from the Miami Conservancy District. The land bordered Wilbur Wright Field. Adjacent to it in order to provide support, the Fairfield Aviation General Supply Depot provided logistics support to Wilbur Wright Field and three other Signal Corps aviation schools located in the Midwest. Each day the depot received, stored, and issued equipment and supplies to Signal Corps aviation schools in the region. In 1924, additional land was purchased and the deeds presented to President Calvin Coolidge for the construction of a new aviation engineering center. The entire acreage including the Fairfield Air Depot was designated Wright Field in honor of both Wright brothers. Between 1925 and 1927, modern new facilities were built. Orville Wright raised the flag over the new engineering center at the official dedication ceremony on 12 October 1927. The merged facilities were renamed Wright Field in honor of the Wright brothers and became headquarters for the Material Division of the United States Army Air Corps. Wright Field retained its flying facilities, with the Fairfield Air Depot supporting its operations as well as the Air Corps engineering center. Wilbur Wright Field and the Fairfield Air Depot, 1920s The Material Division was responsible for developing advanced aircraft, equipment, and accessories. The Division also procured and provided maintenance for all of these systems and was charged with managing the extensive Air Corps depot system. The functions of the Division were ultimately broken into two separate commands, the Materiel Command and the Air Service Command. The Materiel Command, headquartered at Wright Field, was responsible for the procurement of airplanes and equipment in production quantities and for sustaining an accelerated program of testing and development. The Air Service Command, located on Patterson Field, northeast of Wright Field, assumed responsibility for all logistics functions, including maintenance and supply. The Fairfield Air Depot on Wright Field remained active until 1946 when its facilities were moved to Patterson Field as part of Air Service Command. The location of the Fairfield Air Depot is now the National Museum of the United States Air Force.

She had been sexually assaulted at a party eight days earlier by three 16-year-old boys she knew, and nude pictures of her were posted online with accompanying bullying. On September 30, 2014, California Governor Jerry Brown signed Audrie's Law, \\"a bill that increases penalties and decreases privacy protections for teens convicted of sex acts on someone who is passed out from drugs or alcohol or incapable of giving consent due to a disability\\". Background On September 3, 2012, Pott went to a party with about ten other teenagers where she became drunk. A few kids had stolen rum, and an adult had bought them vodka at a liquor shop. Once she was drunk, she was dragged up the stairs and into a bedroom. Three or more teenagers sexually assaulted Pott there. Three 16-year-old boys whom she knew eventually pleaded guilty to and served time in juvenile hall for the sexual assault. Markers were also used to draw and write on her body, and photographs were taken and distributed via social network and MMS. In the following days, Pott was bullied by some who saw the photographs. On September 12, 2012, she killed herself by hanging. Investigation In April 2013, three sixteen-year-old boys were arrested in northern California on suspicion of sexual battery to Pott. Pott's parents also filed a lawsuit against the three teenagers, and in July 2013 they added a fifteen-year-old girl as a defendant in the suit, alleging she was present during the assault and later lied about it to help cover it up. Juvenile court case Three teenage boys admitted in juvenile court to sexually assaulting and possessing photos of Audrie Pott, both felonies. Two of the three received 30-day sentences to be served on weekends. The other was sentenced to 45 consecutive days. Because of their ages, the three teenagers were not at first publicly identified, though they were later. Civil trial A civil case filed by Pott's parents, to decide if the boys were responsible for her death, was originally set to go to forward to trial in April 2015, but reached settlement before then. As part of the terms of settlement, two of the boys were required to verbally apologize in open court, admit again to the sexual assault, admit to their role in the death of Audrie Pott, agree to being filmed in a documentary, pay a combined $950,000, support the petition for an honorary diploma for Audrie Pott, and give ten presentations on sexual assault and sexting.

In 1815 he took out a patent with his cousin Peter Martineau (son of Peter Finch Martineau) for a new means of decolourising sugar during refining. Through the mining interests of the Martineau family, he came into contact with his cousins John Taylor and Philip Taylor, who became business partners. At that point the Taylors were running a chemical business, backed by Martineau money. Under the influence of the Martineaus, the Taylors introduced a high-pressure boiler manufactured by John Braithwaite the younger. Martineau became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1821. After the business of Taylor & Martineau fell away, he in 1827 went into steel manufacture, with Johann Conrad Fischer and Richard Carter Smith. He had an earlier patent on a steel process. With his family, John Martineau planned an emigration to the USA. After his death in 1832 on board ship, they had to return to London. London Mechanics' Institution Martineau was closely associated with George Birkbeck and the London Mechanics' Institution. He attended the meeting in early November 1823 at the Crown and Anchor, Strand, attended by about 50 people, representing with Bryan Donkin and Alexander Galloway employers with an interest in technical training of their staff.Kelly, pp. 82–3. He was a member of the Provisional Committee of 15, with Richard Taylor, brother of Philip.Kelly, p. 86 note. After the mass meeting at the Crown and Anchor on 11 November, there followed a tense and confrontational meeting of 22 November at which the question of subscriptions to the Institution was debated. Joseph Clinton Robertson and Thomas Hodgskin argued the case for rejecting outside subscription, on the grounds that the autonomy of the mechanics to run their own affairs would be limited by accepting the money. They were supported by the architect Robert McWilliam. Martineau and Taylor sided with Birkbeck and Francis Place, in backing the subscription scheme brought forward by William Bayley, which was carried.Kelly, p. 87. Martineau led the poll for vice-president in the election of 15 December 1823, with the other three vice-presidents being McWilliam, John Millington and John Borthwick Gilchrist. He was present at the laying of the foundation stone of the Institution in 1824.Kelly, p. 89. With Galloway, Timothy Bramah and Henry Maudslay, Martineau also testified to Joseph Hume's parliamentary committee on artisans and technology, in the period 1824–5 when a commercial depression was looming.David I.

Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3112919 Family Family connections were particularly significant in the life of John Martineau, a phenomenon that has been remarked on for Dissenter families, such as his. He married Jane Taylor, daughter of Samuel Taylor of New Buckenham and sister of Richard Cowling Taylor, and a second cousin.

Life Sandra Peters studied at the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, and at the Hochschule für Bildende Künste Dresden, where she became a Meisterschülerin (master student) in 2004. She was visiting professor at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, CA in 1999–2000 and at CalArts (California Institute of the Arts), Valencia, CA, in 2011 and 2012. She has taught at New York University Abu Dhabi since 2014. Peters, who was born in Bonn, now lives and works in Abu Dhabi. Work Sandra Peters makes art that engages the architecture of the specific exhibition site in a contrapuntal dialogue, unlocking experiences that call in question preconceived beliefs and entrenched habits of seeing, hearing, and being and moving in a space. Her sculptures pick up on historic sculptural and architectonic paradigms, which she modifies and places in constellations such that the presence of the works is interwoven with glimpses of past cultural formations. Addressing the beholder's bodily reality, her art sustains a situated experience, while also charting fields of associations that have bearing on his or her position, actual as much as imagined, in the world. Peters pursues these concerns both in sculpture strictly conceived and in a range of other media, exploring a variety of formats (sound installation, moving image, film, performance). In 2009–2012, Peters undertook extensive studies into the oeuvre of Rudolph Schindler, an endeavor that bore fruit in a number of works that take inspiration from the architect’s buildings. In 2013, she began to probe various questions that had arisen during her work on these projects. With the sculpture Interface No. 1, realized in 2012, she embarked on a multifaceted investigation of the form of the cube as such. A little later, she gathered initial ideas for a translation of Interface No. 1 into acoustic structures that the audience would experience in an installation with the title SonicCube (2014–). In the course of her examination of the form of the cube, Peters has devoted particular attention to its eleven nets, permutations that served as the point of departure for the sculptures Pandora’s Box (2016) and Untitled (Blaue Blume) (2017–18). Works such as Tango (2013–16) and Zabriskie Point (2013) have a basis in architecture, while also reflecting specific cultural or historic contexts. They are conceived as situations to which the viewer is encouraged to relate by contemplating or moving around them. Both works are composed of different elements whose arrangement in the space conveys an impression of a cohesive ensemble, addressing itself not just to the eye but also to the sense of touch and sensorimotor experience.

It has 20 schools in and around Chennai and one residential school, which are affiliated to Vidya Bharati Akhil Bharatiya Shiksha Sansthan. It was registered as a society in 1972 by a group of persons associated with the Vivekananda Rock Memorial. The society has 20,000 students attending its schools everyday across the city. This society is currently headed by Shri N. Gopalaswami who was a former Chief Election Commissioner of India known to be a person sticking to principles.  Beginnings  Both the Society and the Trust have their roots form the Vivekananda Rock Memorial and Vivekananda Kendra of Kanyakumari. The society was started by like-minded persons inspired by teachings of Swami Vivekananda. The first school to be established was Sri Ram Dayal Kemka Vivekananda Vidyalaya, set up in the locality of Ellai Amman Koil Street, Thiruvottiyur in 1972. Agricultural land which was present in abundance, at that time was converted for educational purposes.but this failed to happen on the46 th year.  Education System  Most of the schools in the society follow the Central Board of Secondary Education curriculum. Some schools like Smt. Ramkuwar Devi Fomra Vivekananda Vidyalaya follow the Tamil Nadu Board after high school. This could be due to more students preferring the state board for the increasing their chances of getting into regional colleges. Students are generally willing to switch schools for this purpose. The Vivekananda Educational Trust was set up in 1991 to establish State board schools in comparatively underdeveloped regions. They follow the matriculation curriculum for ease of teaching and because it would be easier to follow for students hailing from middle- and lower-middle-class families. The trust has 5 schools in Thiruninravur, Minjur, Periasekkadu (Manali), Mudichur and Vallur.  Cultural Activities  Bhajans are held in schools every Friday evening. Competitions like breaking the pot, poetry competitions, dance dramas are held on Krishna Jayanthi. Students are trained to dance for the recorded songs in Indian classical and folk forms, while others are trained to play roles in the skits representing Hindu mythology. Other events besides the Culturals include the Sports Day celebration in January and the Annual day Celebration in February or March. Other functions celebrated are Guru Poornima, Independence Day, Republic Day, Mahakavi Bharatiyar day, Swami Vivekananda Jayanti and Teacher's Day.but these made many culturalists due to non academic activities.  Sports  Sports played in the schools belonging to the society include cricket, football, badminton,chess, carrom kho kho, kabadi, volleyball, throwball etc. Inter school sports meets across the major schools in the society are held every year. Many regional sports meet especially kho kho and kabadi are held in these schools. The society's schools has produced teams who have participated in the national level in kho kho.  Three Day Camp  It is general practice to send pupils from various schools of the society, especially those at a middle school level for a three-day training camp in any one of the various schools present. This camp is voluntary but is generally attended by a majority of students. These camps follow the training methodology similar to RSS's Varg camps but is of a much shorter duration. Stories of saints, national heroes are told to students along with an overview of Upanishads and Vedas. It generally has two major sessions of one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Learning opportunities include getting to know about Yoga and Surya Namaskara along with sports like cricket, football, badminton etc. Vedic Maths, better known as Speed Math is also taught along with traditional arts like garland weaving etc.  List of schools  Its major schools include *Sri Ram Dayal Khemka Vivekananda Vidyalaya Junior College *Smt.

On the initiative of Pyotr Rumyantsev the emblem was phased out and replaced with the Russian double-head eagle in 1767. The Cossack with rifle was recovered by the Hetman of Ukraine Pavlo Skoropadskyi in 1918. However, later the emblem disappeared again until in 2005 it reappeared on the proposed Great Seal of Ukraine. According to the Constitution of Ukraine, the emblem has to be included into the Great Seal of Ukraine.

The historic farm house was built in 1658. The Restaurant Talvo is a traditional gourmet restaurant in a historic building at the Via Gunels in the village of Champfèr in the Engadin in Switzerland. For a certain time the restaurant was once managed by the Badrutt's Palace Hotel. The Talvo became famous in the 1960s and 1970s when the international Jet set discovered St. Moritz and its surroundings as their favourite winter destination. People like Gunther Sachs, Brigitte Bardot, Gianni Agnelli and the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, were regular visitors of the Talvo. The Shah of Iran used to own a mansion in St. Moritz in an area known as Suvretta, near the hotel Suvretta House. When going to the Talvo, the Shah was always escorted by his bodyguards and police officers of the Swiss Federal Police.Philipp Walther: Zur Geschichte des Talvo in Champfèr-St. Moritz. 2013, S. 1.Philipp Walther: Zur Geschichte des Talvo in Champfèr-St. Moritz. 2013, S. 3.  History  The large former farm house which is now known as the Talvo, (Romansh language in the idiom Putèr: barn), was built in 1658. From 1880 until 1887 it was the local schoolhouse for the seven pupils of the village and their teacher, Mr Luzi Battaglia. Afterwards the house was in the possession of the Walther family until 1949. Therefore the house was also known as Chesa Walther. All in all four generations of the Walther family occupied the house. All of them were farmers. However, the last generation of the Walther family also started to rent out rooms to tourists.Philipp Walther: Zur Geschichte des Talvo in Champfèr-St. Moritz. 2013, S. 1.Plan für das Grundbuch der Gemeinde St. Moritz, Mutation 5320, 5. März 2013.  Sale of the Chesa Walther to Dr Eduard Morger from Zurich  The biggest change in the history of the house occurred when the property was sold to the gynaecologist Dr Eduard Morger from Rüschlikon on the west shore of Lake Zurich. At the same time as he bought the historic Chesa Walther, Dr Morger bought all in all the following properties: * The Chesa Walther, now known as the Talvo * The Hotel Bristol * The Villa Granita * The Villa Nice This large acquisition of properties by one single person was widely discussed in the Engadin at the time.Philipp Walther: Zur Geschichte des Talvo in Champfèr-St. Moritz. 2013, S. 1.  Conversion of the Chesa Walther into the Restaurant Talvo  With a substantial amount of money, Dr Morger converted the Chesa Walther into the Restaurant Talvo in 1954. After the conversion, the Talvo was also fitted with 30 guest beds. Within only a few years, the Talvo became one of the most popular places for the Après-ski-society, but it was also a favourite with art lovers. Dr Morger, also a passionate art collector, furnished the Talvo with works of art from his own collection, among others with pictures of Ferdinand Hodler, Alexandre Calame, Pietro Chiesa (1876–1959), Gottardo Segantini (1882–1974) and Hermann Gattiker (1865–1950).Philipp Walther: Zur Geschichte des Talvo in Champfèr-St. Moritz. 2013, S. 2.Baubewilligung Nr. 275, erteilt am 8.

They managed the restaurant themselves and called it Jöhri's Talvo. Roland Jöhri became one of the most famous chefs in Switzerland and again, the Talvo became one of the most celebrated restaurants in the area of St. Moritz. In 2011 Roland and Brigitte Jöhri retired. In the same year the Jöhri’s sold the Talvo to the former Swiss National Councillor and owner of Stadler Rail, Peter Spuhler, and Michael Pieper, owner of Franke. On 1 December 2011 the renowned chef Martin Dalsass and his wife Lorena took over the management of the Talvo, which they subsequently renamed as Talvo by Dalsass.

In 1971, Marshall was elected as the first female member of the York, Pennsylvania, city council. Marshall was elected Mayor of York, Pennsylvania, in November 1977. She took office in January 1978 as the city's first female mayor, serving until January 1982. Early life Marshall was born in Methuen, Massachusetts, on December 17, 1918. Her father, Simon Nath, was a Jewish immigrant to the United States, while her mother, Ella (née McCoy) Nath, was originally from rural New Hampshire. Her family suffered from anti-Semitism and poverty, especially during the Great Depression. Marshall worked for the Remington Arms ammunition factory during World War II. She then earned a certificate from the Lowell Commercial College in Lowell, Massachusetts, and took a position as the executive secretary for Remington Arms. Marshall had first met her future husband, Howard Marshall, while in high school. He served in the Army Air Corps in Burma and China during World War II. She moved to California with her parents following the end of the war. Betty married Howard in a California wedding ceremony after he returned from the Pacific Theater. The couple returned to New England so Howard Marshall could attend Dartmouth College under the G.I. Bill. He later attended graduate school at Yale University, while Betty Marshall worked at Yale School of Medicine as a secretary. Her parents moved to York, Pennsylvania, in the late 1940s. Betty and Howard Marshall also moved to York in 1948. The couple remained permanent residents of York even after her parents moved to Alabama. Her husband opened a York advertising agency. In 1954, the couple moved to a house located on the city's Florida Avenue, where Betty Marshall resided until 2013. They had three children. Political career Betty Marshall worked in her husband's advertising agency, which led to contacts throughout the city. She also worked with young women and volunteering for local organizations. Marshall entered politics in the wake of the 1969 York Race Riot. Marshall's friend, who lived close to the riot, had moved her possessions to Marshall's home, fearing that her own home might be destroyed. The riots and the fear from her friend led Marshall to campaign on behalf of civil rights in the city. In November 1971, Marshall won a seat on the York City Council, becoming the first woman elected to the council. She was sworn into office in January 1972. She had become the President of the York City Council by 1977, when she announced her candidacy for mayor. On November 8, 1977, Betty Marshall was elected Mayor of York, Pennsylvania, the first woman to hold that office in the city's history. Marshall was inaugurated in January 1978. Marshall oversaw major renovations within downtown York during her tenure as mayor, which was met by some community opposition. Marshall restored the main buildings on York Square. She expanded the sidewalks and planted trees in the neighborhood surrounding Continental Square. She also supported the shrinking of Market Street, which encouraged shoppers on foot to return to the downtown shopping district. New parking garages were also constructed. Marshall is also credited with creating a new industrial park, which aided the city's declining industrial base. She spearheaded a residential gentrification project called \\"Back to the City\\" to encourage new residents. The United States Department of State selected Marshall to visit Hungary, as part of a program which allowed American mayors to visit country's within the Warsaw Pact. She was also an active member of the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities. Betty Marshall sought election to a second, four-year term in 1981. However, she was defeated for re-election in November 1981 by Republican challenger William Althaus. She left office in January 1982, but remained active in politics and local organizations into her 80s and 90s. Marshall worked to revive the local Democratic Party throughout the 2000s. She served on the board of directors of the National Organization for Women. Marshall organized the city's first Charette symposium specifically to address urban issues. She volunteered with the Strand-Capitol Performing Arts Center, York Little Theatre, and YMCA, among other organizations. In 2011, Marshall testified in favor of the reauthoritization of the Older Americans Act of 1965 before the U.S. Special Committee on Aging. Marshall was diagnosed with lymphoma in 2008, which went into remission after chemotherapy. She died at her home on Florida Avenue in York on March 29, 2013, at the age of 94. She was survived by her three children. Her husband, Howard, died in 2001.

Victor Konkov, nicknamed \\"Konyok\\" (Yevgeny Mironov), has always wanted to become someone who can benefit humanity. He worked as a cook, loved a waitress and rode around the city on a bicycle, but at the same time he firmly believed in the great future - for him and the society. Soon in his languid existence a mysterious man with an alien and mysterious name Herman (Eugene Tsyganov) appears. To somehow explain his strange behavior, Herman tells Konyok that across the country there is a secret selection of special people who will be later collected in Kostanay and sent into space. On one occasion Herman with delicate kisses seduces Konyok's woman - Lara (Irina Pegova). Konyok is not disheartened for long and switches to her sister Rimma (Elena Liadova).

Aside from being the honor guard unit, it is also charged with duties assisting the Commander, Moscow Garrison, and to serve garrison and protection duties in the protection of the capital city and its military infrastructure. Its barracks is at Lefortovo District, Moscow, part of the South-Eastern Administrative Okrug.  History  As the Second World War was beginning to end in Europe in 1944 the Soviet NKVD in Moscow was charged with raising a full-time honor guard company as part of the 1st Regiment, OMSDON (then the NKVD 1st Special Duties Division), in the style and manner of the British Household Division's Foot Guards, the 3rd US Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) and the French Republican Guard's First Infantry Regiment. Its first duties included the state visit of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill that year.https://rg.ru/amp/2014/12/17/kazarmi.htmlhttps://echo.msk.ru/amp/programs/voensovet/833170-echo/ It later joined the 73rd Special Duties Battalion (later the 465th Special Duties Company, later itself renamed the 465th Special Commandant's Company) in 1948, now part of the regular armed forces. This was the precursor of the Honor Guard Company that would later form the 154th ICR of today, the very company in which the Victory Banner was welcomed with full honors in June 1945 into Moscow. On 10 April 1949, the 465th SCC, by order of the Soviet Armed Forces General Staff, became the 99th Independent Commandant's Battalion. On 29 November 1956, by order of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, the 1st Independent Honor Guard Company and the Military Band of the Honor Guard were raised, both under the supervision of the Office of the Moscow Military Garrison Commandant. The company adopted full parade dress in 1960 in the uniforms of the 3 service arms of the Soviet Armed Forces: the Soviet Army, Soviet Air Forces and the Soviet Navy in its three platoons. The regulations for such use were amended via a 1971 General Orders of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union, to be used only in state occasions, ceremonies and national holidays when permitted. In December 1979, on the recommendation of the Soviet Army General Staff the 99th ICB became the 154th Independent Commandant's Regiment, therefore merging the 99th ICB and the 1st IHGC and raising new component units. Its duty was for the protection of the Moscow Garrison Commandant's headquarters and providing ceremonial guards in state events. In 1980 several servicemen from the regiment took part in the 1980 Olympic opening ceremony wearing civilian formal dress escorting the Olympic Flag. The regiment's Special Duties Company took part in Exercise Zapad-81 the following year as part of the Soviet Armed Forces contingent, and received the Medal \\"For Courage in a Fire\\" for its fire fighting efforts that year when a fire broke out in the Moscow Oblast. The regiment took part in the 1985 World Festival of Youth and Students and in the 1987 commemorations of the 175th anniversary of the Battle of Borodino. In May 1991, the 1st Independent Honor Guard Company became the Honor Guard Battalion of the 154th ICR as another honor guard company was raised. In 2006, an amateur theater was created within the regiment. The 154th Independent Commandant's Regiment formally became the 154th 'Preobrazhensky' Independent Commandant's Regiment (the \\"Preobrazhensky\\" honorific title was in tribute to the Preobrazhensky Regiment) on 9 April 2013 by presidential decree no. 326 signed by Russian president Vladimir Putin.\\"Отдельному комендантскому полку присвоено почётное наименование\\" (Russian), Official site of the President of Russia (9 April 2013)https://tass.ru/moskva/603256 Putin had previously outlined a plan to reinstate the regiment's honorific title in an address to the Russian Federal Assembly in 2012,\\"Address to the Federal Assembly\\", Official site of the President of Russia (12 December 2012) with the stated aim being to \\"strengthen the historical continuity\\" of the Russian Armed Forces by resurrecting the names of \\"famous, legendary units and formations of the Russian and Soviet armies\\".\\"Президент возродил Семёновский полк\\" (Russian), Komsomolskaya Pravda (16 April 2013) On 10 September 2018, on the basis of the regiment, the House of the Yunarmia was opened.В Москве открыли Дом \\"ЮНАРМИИ\\" The 154th ICR today The regiment today is made of more than a thousand servicemen from all units of the Russian Armed Forces, composed of 3 battalions (the Honor Guard Battalion. and the 1st and 2nd Commandant's Battalions) and other independent units comprising it, including its Special Duties Company. The 154th Independent Commandant's Regiment, and its predecessors, have been involved in various state and international events through the years. Aside from its duties at sporting events, other activities where they were involved include their attendance in various Soviet state funerals (including the Death and state funeral of Leonid Brezhnev) and in the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow from 1965 onward, where they always provide the honor guard unit and troop the Victory Banner on Red Squarehttps://sputniknews.com/russia/201805091064272725-russia-moscow-victory- military-parade/ for the annual parade among other commemorative activities. Recent regimental enlistment and passing-out parades have been held on the historic Poklonnaya Hill - at the Museum of the Great Patriotic War, Moscow. Foreign appearances The regiment on Tiananmen Square. Being a representative part of the Russian military, it is often asked to represent the nation at foreign military parades and ceremonies. One of its biggest foreign appearances was at the 2015 China Victory Day Parade, which celebrated the 70th anniversary of Victory over Japan Day of World War II.https://www.rt.com/russia/314080-dm-shoigu-praises-russian- chinese/https://thediplomat.com/2015/08/what-countries-will-march-in-chinas- ww2-anniversary-military- parade/https://sputniknews.com/asia/201508311026414326/ Within the Commonwealth of Independent States, it has represented the nation at small scale events, usually during presentations of war flags or the Victory Banner to these countries. Outside of the CIS sphere however, the regiment has been seen representing the nation on the national days of multiple countries, including Italy, France, Mexico, Libya and Venezuela.

Biography Tesnière became a professional cyclist in 1978 for the Fiat team, and started in the 1978 Tour de France. He finished in last place, and this gave him enough publicity to be invited for several post-Tour criteriums after the Tour. In 1979, Tesnière rode the Tour de France, and after the 20th stage he occupied the last place in the general classification. Tesnière was also leading the intermediate sprints classification, and wanted to profit from the publicity of winning the intermediate sprints classification while finishing last in the general classification. However, he was worried that Gerhard Schönbacher, second-to- last in the general classification, would take over the last place. The 21st stage was run as an individual time trial, and Tesnière rode extra slow to secure his last place. The winner of the time trial, Bernard Hinault, took 1 hour, 8 minutes and 53 seconds to cover the 48.8 km, while Tesniere rode it in 1 hour, 23 minutes and 32 seconds; slower than all other cyclists. Tesnière's time was more than 20% slower than Hinault's, which meant that he had missed the time cut, and was taken out of the race. The Fiat team folded at the end of 1979, and Tesnière started 1980 without a contract, but he was given the chance to ride the Tour de France for the team \\"les amis du Tour\\", a team especially made for cyclists without a sponsor. For the Tour, this team was combined with the Boston team, and the team leader from Boston told Tesnière that he could sign a contract if he would show something special in the Tour. Tesnière escaped in the first stage, and although he did not stay away until the finish, he collected enough points for the mountains classification to become the leader for two stages, which gave his team publicity. Tesnière collided in the third stage with a spectator and had to leave the race, but still he was given a contract for Boston. In 1981, Tesnière rode the Tour de France for Boston. He finished the race in the penultimate 120th position. At the end of the season, the team folded, and Tesnière's professional career ended. Tesnière rode for four more years as an amateur, until 1985. Tesnière was diagnosed with cancer in 1987, and died six months later.

Description The Pipers are on a northeast to southwest alignment which points almost directly at The Merry Maidens. The two stones stand in separate fields about 90 metres apart. The southwest stone is the taller of the two, measuring 4.7 metres high--there are two longitudinal cracks down the northwest side, and one down the southeast side. The northeast stone is 4.2 metres high and is of rectangular section--the stone leans to the northwest. Myth and legend The name of these two stones derives from a legend that they were in fact two pipers who were turned to stone for playing music on the Sabbath for the nearby dancing Merry Maidens. A different legend states that the two stones were set up following a 10th-century battle in which the Anglo-Saxon English, led by Æthelstan, fought the Cornish Celts, led by Howel and supported by the Danes. The Pipers were said to mark the positions of the two opposing leaders. Research The stones were first recorded by William Borlase in 1754.

It is an Anglo-Catholic church in the Diocese of London of the Church of England. It is at the junction of Exmouth Market and Rosebery Avenue in the London Borough of Islington. The church with attached clergy house, campanile, and parish hall is a Grade II*-listed building. \\"This church is of outstanding importance as an example of the late C19 reaction against High Victorian Gothic. Sedding accomplished this by using the pure Italian Renaissance style. In doing so, he not only created a 'monument to the Aestheticism of the late Victorian Anglo- Catholics', but made the church look Roman Catholic. Wilson's work to the church is particularly fine; and his interesting subsidiary buildings (parish- hall, clergy-house, and especially the campanile) flanking the front facade are extremely clever and idiosyncratic. This complex was built in the heart of a significant Italian community. These buildings form a remarkable group.\\" History This Italianate church was built in 1888 to the designs of J. D. Sedding, and completed, after his death, by his assistant Henry Wilson, 1892–95. The church, which was built in the grounds of the former Spa Fields Chapel, originally comprised just the building on the left in the illustration, the campanile tower and clergy house on the right being added in 1906. The inscription on the cornice of the original structure reads Christo Liberatori translated as 'To Christ The Redeemer'. The interior of the church, including the baldacchino, was modelled upon Brunelleschi's Santo Spirito, Florence. Sculptural carving to the interior is by F. W. Pomeroy. Present day The Church of Our Most Holy Redeemer is within the Traditional Catholic tradition of the Church of England and receives alternative episcopal oversight from the Bishop of Fulham (currently Jonathan Baker).

Minamitama (南多摩郡, Minamitama- gun, South Tama) was a district or county (gun) of Tokyo (Metropolis/{refecture), Japan. It was created in the early Meiji era when the old Tama District of Musashi Province was divided into four parts and split between Kanagawa and Tokyo. It lost its status as an administrative unit in the 1920s when county governments and councils were abolished across the country. As a geographical unit, it ceased to exist in 1971 when its last two remaining municipalities were promoted to independent cities. History * Minamitama District was created in 1878 and initially consisted of more than 120 subdivisions. * When the modern municipality system was set up in 1889, Miniamitama District consisted of one town (the county seat of Hachiōji) and 19 villages. * In 1893, Minamitama District was transferred from Kanagawa Prefecture to Tokyo Prefecture; alongside Nishitama (West Tama) and Kitatama (North Tama) Districts. Higashitama (East Tama) District had been part of Tokyo since its creation. Several villages within Minamitama were promoted to towns over the decades. * The first loss of territory came in 1917 when Hachiōji was elevated city status (becoming the second city in Tokyo Prefecture after Tokyo City). * In 1941, Komiyama was merged into Hachiōji followed by another six municipalities in 1955. * In 1958, Machida Town absorbed three villages to become Machida City. * In 1963, Hino Town was elevated to city status after previously merging with other villages. * In 1964, the merger of the village of Yugi into Hachiōji left Minamitama District with only two remaining municipalities: the towns of Tama and Inagi. Both were elevated to city status on November 1, 1971. Electoral district An electoral district for the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly is named Minamitama to the day. As of 2013, it still consists of the cities of Tama and Inagi and sends two members to the prefectural legislature. Inagi is also the last municipality in mainland Tokyo that maintains its own municipal fire department, Tama gave up its own fire department in 1975 and transferred the responsibility for fire protection to the Tokyo Fire Department.

Abbreviated as PKW na Rusi,Ukraińska Republika Ludowa. www.kresy.pl it was headed by Joachim Bartoszewicz. PSO was created on March 3–4, 1917 in Kharkiv headed by T. Żarski. These political associations, the declared tactic of which was quite contrary, at the same time consisted of different centers of one party. PSO in Kharkiv was created by former members of the PPS-FR and also included representatives of the PPS-L and the SDKPiL, while Kiev members of the PPS-FR led by Kazimierz Domosławski were more supportive of the PKW. Despite that none of the centers considered itself representative of the one PPS-FR. Background During March and start of July 1917 quite actively to nation-building activity of the Central Council of Ukraine reacted PKW. The appeals of the committee shows an anticipating and situational nature of liberals in regards to the Ukrainian question who de facto controlled the committee and for a long time (to July) were able to set aside Polish socialists and democrats that cooperated with PKW from political activity. That position was stipulated by the pro-Russian orientation of the committee and its support of the Russian Provisional Government from one side and from another - the desire of immediate implementation of national self- determination rights for peoples of the Russian Empire. After the proclamation of the First Universal of the Central Council of Ukraine, PKW left number of socialists and democrats at the following Kiev Congress of Polish Communities on June 23, 1917. Nonetheless, on June 30, 1917 PKW in its appeal to the Central Council indicated that \\"the Congress of Polish organizations in Ruthenia warmly welcomes the aspirations of the fraternal Ukrainian nation to political liberation and declares that the Poles, who are considered an indigenous citizens of the land, are ready to work together in laying the foundations of the Ukrainian nation own existence with ensuring the rights of the Polish national minority in Ukraine\\". Among the former members of PKW was the Polish Democratic Central (Polska Centrala Demokratyczna,. Asta publishers. Poland, 2011 leader - Jevgeniusz Straczewski and S.Stempowski) which was a block of four democratic parties in Ukraine, and the conservative Party of National Labor (Stronnictwo Pracy Narodowej, leader - Janusz Radziwill, Waclaw Grzybowski, and Stanislaw Horwatt). Among the most prominent politicians of the Democratic Central was Meczyslaw Mickiewicz. In support of the democrats and number of socialists who left PKW Domoslawski declared that his party, PPS-FR, recognizes PKW as an excess organization, because it is a simple block of bourgeoisie. However soon PKW went into opposition to the Central Council of Ukraine when the last adopted the declaration of the Russian Provisional Government for Ukraine on July 3, 1917 and allowed other Polish parties to join its ranks.

The area was formerly part of Batmans Swamp, a large saltwater lagoon, which by the mid 19th century had become fouled with effluent from the growing city.Gary Vines (1999) Dudley Flats Archaeological Investigation, www.academia.edu Dudley Flats was on the fringe of the Melbourne city area, and became a dumping ground, with rubbish tips and a destructor established in the 1860s by the Melbourne City Council and Victorian Railways. The Melbourne Harbour Trust deposited dredged silt as part of land reclamation, and the railways tipped ash from locomotives at the North Melbourne Locomotive Depot from around 1888. History During the Great Depression of the 1930s (and also possibly from an earlier date), the site was visited and then occupied by Melbourne's poor and homeless who scavenged for scrap and rags from the tips, and built humpies out of discarded rubbish such as old timber and corrugated iron, even lino and hessian sacking. By 1935, over 60 humpies had been erected along the waterways and around the rubbish tips. Despite regular raids by the police and possibly Harbour Trust officers, who attempted to move people out and demolish their huts, the area continued to be occupied at least up until World War II. The camps had been able to remain or be reestablished in part because of disputes between the various government bodies over who had authority, with the Railways Department, Melbourne City Council, the Melbourne Harbour Trust, the Board of Works, and the Lands Department, all refusing to claim responsibility for the area. Some of the residents were unemployed or underemployed labourers who occasionally gained work with shipping agents and stevedores at times of peak demands, but were otherwise left to scavenge an existence as best they could. The social reformer Frederick Oswald Barnett made several inspections of the congested residential areas of Melbourne's inner suburbs in 1933, including Dudley Mansions as the humpies were called. One of the \\"Dudley Mansions\\", The Unsuspected Slums West Melbourne, Culture Victoria. He photographed the slums and the residents' living conditions and recorded information on the residents' state of health, income, and where they obtained work (if at all). This material contributed to reports on slum conditions which eventually pressured the government into passing the Housing Act of 1937.Barnett collection of Historic Photographs, Record 544, Housing and Construction Victoria Library. Department of Planning and Housing. Structure of the camps There were several separate camps in the area identified by Bamett and Edgar Thomas Wood, the Melbourne City Council health inspector from 1910 to 1949. Dudley Flats proper was located south of Footscray Road on the banks of the Coal Canal – constructed in the 1880s as an outlet for Moonee Ponds Creek, and to allow barges to unload coal at the locomotive depot. The 'Batchelor Quarters' were located on the north side of Dudley Street near a bridge over the canal, while 'Happy Valley' was on the east side of the canal. Residents were given notice of eviction in 1938, but nothing seems to have been done to remove them. The Melbourne City Council hosted a conference of the authorities responsible, which resolved unanimously: that the shacks and their occupants on areas of land at West Melbourne controlled by the Lands Department, Harbour Trust and Railways Dept, constitute a nuisance and should, in the occupants' interests, the interests of the community, and for health reasons, be removed therefrom ... the Conference recommends that the Departments concerned be asked to give the occupants notice to vacate the area within one month, and, on vacation, to have the structures entirely demolished.\\"This Life Suits Me\\": Dudley Flats to Docklands', Kasia Zygmuntowicz, Public Record Office Victoria, published in Ancestor December 2002. A little later council resolved to instruct the town clerk (Mr. H. S. Wootton) to discuss the matter with the Lands Department with a view ... to serve notices to quit on the Inhabitants, and to house them in charitable homes. According to Council files, the settlement was abandoned in the early 1940s, because the nearby tips no longer held a living for scavengers after waste recovery schemes had been initiated to assist in the war effort.Newspaper clippings and Wood report in Melbourne City Council Archives, file 38/1894 on Dudley Flats. Official settlement in the area seems to have involved only the occasional watchman at the nearby wharves. For example, Clement F. Harvey is recorded as living beside the Railway Canal on the North Side of Dudley Street West Melbourne in the Sands and McDougall Post Office Directory for 1929. However, the unofficial, and possibly illegal occupation of Dudley Flats was not recorded in the normal official sources. Jack Peacock, a salvage dealer, was popularly known as the 'King of Dudley Flats' and was the flats' longest resident, having arrived in about 1932 and remained until the early 1950s, insisting on his rights to remain, claiming he had money enough to support himself and This life suits me and it is only the mental weaklings who desire to remove me.

Goudy Award & Lecture were established in 1969 by funds donated to Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) by the Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust in memory of Mrs. Cary's late husband, Melbert B. Cary, Jr., a typographer, type importer, fine printer, book collector, and president of AIGA (American Institute of Graphic Arts).The RIT Frederic W. Goudy Award: 27 Years of Excellence in Typography The award was named after illustrious American type designer Frederic W. Goudy, a friend and business associate of Mr. Cary. In the Preface to the book Twenty Years of the Frederic W. Goudy Award Twenty Years of the Frederic W. Goudy AwardTwenty Years of the Frederic W. Goudy Award (Press of the Good Mountain, RIT 1988), Alexander Lawson, RIT Cary Professor emeritus and 1979 recipient of the Goudy Award, wrote: > \\"The Cary Trustees also funded an annual Frederic W. Goudy Award to be given > to an outstanding practitioner in the field of typography. The person would > deliver a Goudy Lecture and meet with students in class and in groups, thus > providing an opportunity for informal contact with a distinguished graphic > arts figure.\\" In the \\"Foreword\\" to the same book, Mark Guldin, then Cary Professor, former chair of the School of Printing and former Dean of the RIT College of Imaging Arts and Sciences, wrote: > \\"Down through the years, we have always tried to choose those designers and > typophiles for the Award who have that thread of attachment to Frederic W. > Goudy, those who have worked with the design of typefaces and those who have > produced designs cradled in the traditional values of Gutenberg, Jenson, > Aldus, Baskerville, and Bodoni. Goudy cherished those traditional values.\\" The Goudy Award and Lecture was given annually from 1969 to 1995. It was discontinued in 1996 when the institute diverted the funding to other purposes. It was revived in 2012, discontinued again, and revived again in 2015. Printing and typography RIT alumni and friends of the Cary Collection hope it shall continue annually. Recipients of the Goudy Award In the first years of the Goudy Award, some of the honorees had known Fred Goudy personally, thereby establishing a direct link with the eponymous past. Although that generation of typographers has passed on, along with much of the analog typographic technology and industry that Goudy and Cary were familiar with, many of Goudy's typefaces, long admired and cherished by typographic aficionados, live on and remain popular in digital formats, while new typeface designs by several Goudy Award honorees have become widely popular in digital form. Goudy Award honorees have generally been outstanding practitioners in the field of typography, including some or all of the following professions: * Professional typographer and/or typographic designer * Typeface designer or lettering artist * Creator of designs and printing in the tradition Goudy cherished * Personal and/or cultural connection to Goudy * Educator, historian, scholar, and/or author in the fields of typography, printing, or lettering The work of the Goudy Award honorees reveals another, implicit criterion: they elevated the artistic, scholarly, and ethical level of typography, whether through type design, like Hermann Zapf, Gudrun Zapf-Von Hesse, Adrian Frutiger, Matthew Carter, and Kris Holmes; through the art of fine printing, like Will Carter, Henry Morris, and Giovanni Mardersteig; through artistic typography and printing in commercial publishing and graphic design, like Roderick Stinehour, Bradbury Thompson, and Robert Bringhurst; through engagement in the social issues and responsibilities of typography, like Edna Beilenson and Robert (Doc) Leslie, and through typographic education and scholarship, like Alexander Lawson, John Dreyfus, Warren Chappell, and Charles Bigelow. Goudy Award honorees have been among the most honored and admired figures in the typographic arts. Three have received MacArthur Prize Fellowships (Bigelow, Carter, and Van Vliet). Four have received the AIGA Medal (Mardersteig, Leslie, Thompson, Carter). Four have received the Mainz Gutenberg Award (Mardersteig, Zapf, Frutiger, Dreyfus). Nine have received the Type Directors Club Medal (Zapf, Middleton, Leslie, Thompson, Frutiger, Craw, Benguiat, Carter, Lange). Others have received numerous honors and awards in England, Europe, and America.

It was on Lehrer's first album Songs by Tom Lehrer from 1953, and a new live recording on Tom Lehrer Revisited in 1960. The song is a parody of a popular tune well known at the time titled \\"The Old Lamp-Lighter\\" by Charles Tobias and Nat Simon, a hit first for Kay Kyser in 1947, and continued to have popular new recordings to 1960. The verses of the original asserted that :\\"He made the night a little brighter :Wherever he would go :The old lamplighter :Of long, long ago\\" It goes on to say that if there were sweethearts in the dark, \\"he'd pass the light and leave it dark,\\" and concludes by explaining that now, the old lamplighter turns the stars on at night and turns them off at dawn. Lehrer's parody switches the song's protagonist to \\"the Old Dope Peddler\\" selling \\"powdered happiness\\". It has lines like this: : \\"He gives the kids free samples : because he knows full well : that today's young, innocent faces : will be tomorrow's clientele\\" The song was banned from broadcast by the BBC.

These are overlain in the coastal zone by Cretaceous and Cenozoic sediments. The northern part of the country has a basement of Neoproterozoic metamorphic rocks and Paleoproterozoic granite. The south of the country is covered in sedimentary basins, covering 3,300 km.2 of land. The West African Craton is made up of crystalline structures, ranging in age from the Neoarchean to the Paleoproterozoic age. The North-Dapaong zone, which is located in the West African Craton, migmatites, gneisses, amphibolites, granodiorites and granites are commonly found. The Neoproterozoic Volta Basin contains sedimentary formations on the Birrimian bedrocks. These sedimentary formations are divided into two groups: an intra-tillite group and a supra-tillite group.  Economic geology  Togo mines gold, diamonds, and phosphate rock, with the largest of these being phosphate rock. The phosphate rock is found Eocene deposits at the coastal basin. In addition to those easy to exploit locations, there are also hardened Neoproterozoic which have not been exploited. The country is Africa's sixth highest producer of phosphate rock. Diamonds and gold are extracted on the artisanal level, and is Africa's sixth largest gold producer. The diamonds are found in alluvial formations in rivers. Exploration activities unveiled the possibility of mining in the future: bauxite, gypsum, iron ore, manganese, marble, rutile, zinc, uranium, and lithic metals.

Its mission is gathering and disseminating knowledge about non-conventional energy, energy conservation, and rural technology. The agency was established in 1986 with its headquarters at Thiruvananthapuram.  About  ANERT is an autonomous organization established as an institution under the Indian Department of Science and Technology, and is the primary agency carrying out topical programs in Kerala for the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), a bureau of the Government of India. The body was registered under the Charitable Societies Act by the government of Kerala, and now functions under the state's Power Department. Administration Governing body ANERT is administered by a governing body chaired by the state Minister for Electricity, with highest oversight by a director appointed by the Government. This board provides direction for activities in various energy-related areas. Executive Committee ANERT has also an executive committee chaired by the Secretary to the Government of Kerala, Power Department. Other members are the Secretary to Government for the Finance (Expenditure) Department, Government of Kerala, the chairman of the Kerala State Electricity Board, the member secretary of the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment, and two additional members nominated by the state government. Programmes Major programmes that are implemented by ANERT are:  Solar Photovoltaic Programme (SPV)  Under this programme, ANERT distributes devices which use solar energy. These include solar lanterns, home lighting systems, street light systems, TV power packs, and vaccine refrigerators. These devices are distributed in accordance with MNRE and other programmes using ANERT funds.  Solar Thermal Energy Programme  The Solar Thermal Energy Programme aims to supplement thermal energy requirements at various temperatures for different applications; they include cooking, water heating, heating for industrial processes, crop drying, space heating, and water desalination. Programme processes include harnessing solar energy from the Sun and converting it into heat energy using various solar thermal devices and systems.  Wind Energy Programme  ANERT is in the process of increasing wind power usage at different locations within the state. In association with MNRE, the agency has conducted a detailed study of the wind potential in Kerala. Its largest capacity wind farm is located at Kanjikode, in Palakkad District; it has a capacity of 22 MW  Bio-Energy Programme  This program aims to recover energy from waste; study the scientific disposal of waste; convert waste into fertilizer after energy extraction; improve sanitation; protect the environment; and generate relevant employment opportunities. Domestic and industrial biowaste is of major import to the agency, as it can be converted into producer gas via gasification. This gas can be used for heating and generating electricity.  National Programme on Improved Chulha  In 2001, as part of its declared \\"Women's Empowerment Year\\", MNRE decided to make 10,000 villages throughout India \\"smoke free\\" by the promotion of improved chulhas, or cooking stoves.  Training and Workshops  ANERT provides training and workshops for field level staffs to improve services.  Policies   Kerala Renewable Energy Policy 2002  The Kerala Renewable Energy Policy was introduced in April 2002 to develop, propagate, and promote non-conventional energy sources, as well as to exploit natural resources for cheaper power projects.  Wind Energy Policy 2004  The Wind Energy Policy was instituted to set up wind farms on private lands in Kerala.  Kerala Solar Energy Policy 2013  In November 2013 the Solar Energy Policy was implemented to increase the use of solar energy appliances in Kerala.

Biography  Dumenko was born in the Don region and took an active part in the organization of the first Soviet cavalry units. A sergeant at the end of World War I, he returned to the Don and took command of a small unit of Red Cossacks, with Semyon Budyonny as his assistant. In September 1918, he became commander of the 1st Cavalry Brigade and in December 1918 of the 1st Cavalry Division within the 10th Army. In January 1919, he became commander of the 4th Cavalry Division of Petrograd. In April 1919, he was appointed assistant Chief of Staff of the 10th Army for the Cavalry. On 25 May 1919, he was seriously wounded by a bullet in a lung and he was evacuated to Saratov. On 14 September 1919, he became commander of the newly created Cavalry Corps. Between September and December 1919, the Cavalry Corps won a series of battles and advanced over the Don Region towards the Caucasus. On 7 January 1920, it took Novocherkassk, the capital of the Don Army.  Death  Despite the fact that Dumenko had joined the Bolshevik Party in January 1920, the Political Department of the corps and higher political authorities accused him of encouraging anti-Bolshevik and anti-Semitic sentiments among the rank-and-file troopers, hampering the work of the military commissars, and insufficiently combating the robbery and drunkenness of the Red Army soldiers. In order to resolve the growing serious conflict between Dumenko and the political Department, a new military commissar, V.N. Mikeladze, was sent to the Cavalry Corps in December 1919, but was killed in February 1920 under unclear circumstances. The identity of the murderer was not established by the investigation. Despite this, Dumenko was arrested along with six of his closest assistants on charges of killing the military commissar and preparing a mutiny. The accusations came from Dmitry Zhloba, the commander of one of the brigades, military adviser G. Peskarev, and commissar Kravtsov. Dumenko's trial was presided over by Alexander Beloborodov. Found guilty, Dumenko and three others were shot on 11 or 13 May 1920. The background of this execution is the conflict between Trotsky and Stalin. Dumenko was a supporter of Stalin, his successor Mikhail Tukhachevsky a nominee of Trotsky. Dumenko had been highly critical on the policy of Lev Trotsky of having political commissaries control the Army commanders from the rearguard and not in combat. Dumenko was rehabilitated in August 1964.

The type entered Australian service in December 1958, when No. 36 Squadron accepted the first of twelve C-130As, replacing its venerable Douglas C-47 Dakotas. The acquisition made Australia the first operator of the Hercules after the United States. In 1966 the C-130As were joined by twelve C-130Es, which equipped No. 37 Squadron. The C-130As were replaced by twelve C-130Hs in 1978, and the C-130Es by twelve C-130J Super Hercules in 1999. No. 37 Squadron became the RAAF's sole Hercules operator in 2006, when No. 36 Squadron transferred its C-130Hs prior to converting to Boeing C-17 Globemaster III heavy transports. The C-130Hs were retired in November 2012, leaving the C-130J as the only model in Australian service. The RAAF's first strategic airlifter, the Hercules has frequently been used to deliver disaster relief in Australia and the Pacific region, as well as to support military deployments overseas. The aircraft saw extensive service during the Vietnam War, transporting troops and cargo to Southeast Asia and undertaking aeromedical evacuation. Nineteen of the RAAF's fleet of twenty-four C-130s took part in relief efforts in 1974–75 after Cyclone Tracy struck Darwin. Since then, the Hercules have been involved in humanitarian missions to New Guinea, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Cambodia, Bali, Sumatra, and New Zealand. They have also seen service during the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the Fijian coups in 1987, operations in Somalia in 1993, INTERFET operations in East Timor in 1999–2000, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq beginning in 2001. In over fifty years of Australian service, the Hercules have accumulated more than 800,000 flying hours. Acquisition Initial selection and purchase At the end of World War II, the RAAF's prime transport aircraft was the twin-engined Douglas C-47 Dakota. In 1946, C-47 operations were concentrated under No. 86 Wing and its three flying squadrons, Nos. 36, 37, and 38, based initially at RAAF Station Schofields, New South Wales.Parnell; Lynch, Australian Air Force Since 1911, p. 165Roylance, Air Base Richmond, pp. 92–93 Despite the robustness and versatility of the Dakota, by the early 1950s the Air Force was looking for a replacement with greater cargo capacity and longer range, to better facilitate the deployment and supply of Australian forces.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 43, 416 In 1954, the RAAF embarked on a major re-equipment drive, following a shift in defence funding that favoured the Air Force. The Air Officer Commanding Home Command, Air Vice Marshal Alister Murdoch, led a mission overseas to examine potential new fighter, bomber, transport and training aircraft.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 38–39 C-130A Hercules of No. 36 Squadron Four British transports were considered: the Blackburn Beverley, Bristol 179B, Bristol 195 and Short PD 16/1. The mission also assessed the American Fairchild C-119G Flying Boxcar, Fairchild C-123 Provider and Lockheed C-130A Hercules. Of these types, the mission assessed that the Beverley, C-123 and C-130 could potentially meet the RAAF's requirements. Following further consideration of the options after their return to Australia, in early 1955 the members of the mission unanimously recommended that Hercules be procured, as the other two types did not meet some of the most important elements of the requirement.Wilson, Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service, p. 102 At this time the Australian Government was reluctant to fund any new equipment for the RAAF, and a decision to acquire twelve C-130s was not made until mid-1957. A contract for these aircraft was signed in October that year. The Australian C-130As were to be similar to those in service with the United States Air Force (USAF), the main difference being the use of TF56-A-11 engines in the place of the usual TF56-A-1 and TF56-A-9s; these engines provided almost the same power, but were modified to meet Australian fuel requirements. The total cost for the aircraft, initial crew training and support equipment was $US36 million (equivalent to about 16 million Australian pounds).Wilson, Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service, pp. 102–103 The Hercules represented a huge improvement over the C-47 in payload, range, speed and manoeuvrability, as well as offering cabin pressurisation, short-takeoff-and- landing capability, and bulk loading and despatch via its rear cargo door. The Government expressed concern over the price, at one stage proposing the purchase of only three aircraft, but eventually the Air Force won approval for the twelve that it wanted. Described by the official history of the post-war RAAF as second only to the General Dynamics F-111C as the \\"most significant\\" acquisition by the Air Force, the Hercules gave the Australian military its first strategic airlift capability, which in years to come would provide a \\"lifeline\\" for deployments to Malaya, Vietnam, and other parts of Southeast Asia.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 416–418 Australia was the first country other than the United States to operate the Hercules.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, pp. 97–98 The RAAF's C-130As were also the last of this variant to be built. RAAF crews began training on the Hercules in mid-1958 at Sewart Air Force Base in Nashville, Tennessee. Much of the training took place on a simulator, augmented by approximately fifty hours flying time in the aircraft. To cope with the Hercules' complexities, the aircrew category of flight engineer, absent from the RAAF since World War II, was reinstated. A new category, that of loadmaster, was also instituted; airmen performing similar duties on Dakotas had done so on an ad hoc rather than a permanent basis, without a distinct category having been formalised.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 165–166 A specialist crew member was needed to make weight-and-balance calculations and oversee loading and despatch for the Hercules' 20-tonne freight capacity (compared to three-and-a-half tonnes in a Dakota) and for its various cargo- delivery systems. A large hangar previously used to service seaplanes at RAAF Base Rathmines was disassembled and re-erected at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, where the C-130s would be based.Wilson, Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service, p. 103 Later models and upgrades A decision to purchase another twelve C-130s was announced in November 1964. At this time the C-130As were being used to supply the Australian forces engaged in the Vietnam War. This task demonstrated that the RAAF had insufficient long-ranged transport aircraft to simultaneously support overseas deployments and meet the force's domestic requirements in Australia. As a result, the Government decided to order twelve C-130E Hercules as part of a package of acquisitions for the RAAF and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) that also included ten Lockheed P-3 Orion and fourteen Grumman S-2 Tracker maritime patrol aircraft, as well as twelve Hawker Siddeley HS 748 transports. The 14.7-million-pound contract for the new C-130s was signed on 9 February 1965.Wilson, Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service, p. 105 In contrast to the concerns raised by the government over the cost of purchasing the C-130As, this expansion of the Hercules force gained ready agreement, due in no small part to the benefits for the armed services, particularly the Australian Army, demonstrated by the first twelve aircraft. The long-serving C-130As were replaced by new Hercules in the late 1970s; twelve C-130Hs were ordered in June 1976 for a cost of $A86 million, and deliveries took place between July and October 1978.Wilson, Military Aircraft of Australia, p. 135 RAAF personnel undertaking preventive maintenance on a C-130J in the Middle East during January 2009 The RAAF's early model Hercules received several repairs and modifications during their service lives. During the early 1960s all of the C-130As were flown to the United States to receive new wing fuel tanks after the original tanks were affected by corrosion caused by tropical fungi and bacteria. Later that decade these aircraft received new panels on the upper surface of their wings after the original ones were found to be faulty.Wilson, Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service, pp. 119–122 The C-130Es were also fitted with strengthened wing centre boxes in the early 1970s after equivalent USAF aircraft were found to be suffering from greater-than-expected wing stress during operations in Vietnam.Wilson, Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service, p. 122 During 1964 the C-130As received new doppler navigation systems, and the C-130Es and Hs were fitted with ring laser gyroscope inertial navigation systems from 1989.Wilson, Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service, pp. 122–123 In 1994, four of No. 36 Squadron's C-130Hs were equipped with Electronic Warfare Self Protection packs, including radar and missile warning systems, and counter measures such as chaff and flares. Later in the decade, one of the C-130Hs was fitted with extensive signals intelligence equipment under the classified \\"Project Peacemate\\"; this aircraft was crewed by RAAF and Defence Signals Directorate personnel and its existence was never publicly confirmed by the Government. The modified C-130H was reported to still be active in the signals intelligence role in 2008.La Franchi, \\"New ADF airlift studies\\" The C-130Hs were also among the first Australian military aircraft to be modified to allow aircrew to operate them while wearing night vision goggles. The Australian Government ordered twelve C-130J Super Hercules in December 1995 and deliveries began during 1999. As part of the deal negotiated with Lockheed Martin, seven of the RAAF's C-130Es were transferred to the company in return for a reduced price on the new aircraft.Kaminski, \\"C-130J Super Hercules Part 2\\", p. 81 At the time the order for the twelve C-130Js was placed, the Government also took out options for a further twenty-seven Super Hercules, but these were not taken up; the options included seven airborne early warning and control and eight aerial refuelling variants, as well as up to eight transports for the Royal New Zealand Air Force.Pittaway, \\"C-130J upgrade\\", p. 16 The RAAF was the first operator of this C-130 variant, which was larger than earlier models and had a crew of only three (two pilots and a loadmaster) eliminating the navigator and flight engineer roles employed in earlier models. The aircraft initially suffered from serious mechanical and software problems as well as a shortage of spare parts, and were assessed as \\"experiencing significant operational shortfalls\\" in a 2002 Australian National Audit Office report.Australian National Audit Office, Test and Evaluation of Major Defence Equipment Acquisitions, pp. 95–97McLaughlin, \\"Hitting its straps\\", p. 32 The Defence Science and Technology Organisation undertook considerable research into the C-130J design and developed improvements to the aircraft that addressed problems with excessive vibration. The 2009 Defence white paper Defending Australia in the Asia Pacific Century: Force 2030 called for the acquisition of two more C-130Js to partially replace the H variants. This purchase did not go ahead, as the government instead ordered a fifth Boeing C-17 Globemaster III. The C-130Js have been updated since entering service. All of the aircraft were fitted with radar warning receivers by the end of 2012, and it is planned to equip the Hercules with Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures systems by 2016. As of 2015, the Hercules' communications capabilities were also to be updated by fitting the aircraft with satellite communications equipment and the equipment necessary to allow them to use the Link 16 data exchange network.Caldwell, \\"Big Lift\\", p. 71 At this time the C-130s were also to be fitted with new high-speed airdrop ramps at the rear of their cabin, and will be cleared to drop larger loads. The C-130J's operating software has also been upgraded over time, leading to improved performance. The RAAF is participating in the development of further software enhancements. During 2016 all of the C-130Js were fitted with advanced satellite communications systems that allowed the aircraft, and embarked troops, to be retasked while in flight. As part of this modification the aircraft were fitted with an additional crew station, and they carry a fourth crew member when necessary to handle complex communications tasks.Moclair, \\"Plugged in\\", pp. 52–54 In 2019 the RAAF was reported to be considering fitting Litening targeting pods to Hercules to improve crew situational awareness and allow aircraft to collect imagery as part of transport flights. Flight trials of a Hercules fitted with a Litening targeting pod began in early 2020. In March 2015 Australian Aviation reported that, as part of the process of developing a new Defence White Paper, the Australian Government was considering purchasing two LC-130J Hercules fitted with landing skis and other equipment needed to allow the aircraft to operate in Antarctica. Such an acquisition would have supported the Australian Antarctic Division's operations following the closure of the Wilkins Runway near Casey Station.Caldwell, \\"Big Lift\\", p. 72 The 2016 Defence White Paper stated that the Hercules fleet would be maintained at twelve upgraded C-130J aircraft.Department of Defence, 2016 Defence White Paper, p. 107 A C-130J flew from Australia to Antarctica in February 2020, the first time a RAAF Hercules had done so since 1983. Operational service Introduction into service The RAAF's twelve C-130As were picked up by their newly trained Australian pilots from the Lockheed factory at Dobbins Air Force Base, Georgia, and ferried to Australia in three groups between December 1958 and March 1959.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 418–420 No. 36 Squadron, located at RAAF Base Richmond, became the first unit to operate the new aircraft. Almost immediately they established regular courier services within Australia and to RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaya. These flights primarily involved transporting cargo, as Chief of the Air Staff Frederick Scherger directed in 1959 that the RAAF would continue to rely on chartered civil airliners to move military personnel on the grounds that these aircraft were better suited to the task and in wartime all the C-130s would be needed to supply troops near the front lines.Wilson, Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service, p. 117 In February 1960 a Hercules flew the RAAF's first AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles from the United States to Butterworth to equip the CAC Sabre fighters based there.Wilson, Sidewinders and Firestreaks, p. 38 Crew training was rigorous, and from mid-1960 involved the use of a simulator. Only seasoned transport pilots flew the Hercules in its early years of service, generally having undertaken a tour of duty with No. 38 Squadron's Dakotas.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 419–420 The official history of the post-war Air Force described the Hercules as \\"probably the biggest step-up in aircraft capabilities\\" the RAAF had ever received, considering it roughly four times as effective as the Dakota, taking into account the improvements in payload, range, and speed.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 417 When No. 78 (Fighter) Wing and its two squadrons of CAC Sabres deployed to Butterworth between October 1958 and February 1959, seven Dakotas were required to ferry the staff and equipment of No. 3 Squadron from Australia to Malaya, compared to two Hercules for No. 77 Squadron.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 259–260 The Hercules were the first turboprop aircraft operated by the RAAF. They were serviced by No. 486 Maintenance Squadron, with deeper maintenance and upgrades carried out by No. 2 Aircraft Depot (No. 2 AD), both units being based at Richmond.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 178 The availability of spare parts from the US caused problems early on, grounding one C-130A for almost a year. C-130E Hercules of No. 37 Squadron at Clark Air Base, Philippines, November 1981 No. 36 Squadron commenced parachute trials with the Hercules in September 1960.RAAF Historical Section, Maritime and Transport Units, pp. 57–59 Beginning in May 1962, RAAF forces based at Ubon, Thailand, under SEATO arrangements were supplied by a regular Hercules service.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 272–275 In December that year, the Hercules made their first troop-carrying flights into a combat zone, when one of No. 36 Squadron's C-130s joined a Commonwealth airlift from Singapore to Borneo at the commencement of the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia; similar missions would be undertaken for a further five years. In 1964, the first two Dassault Mirage III fighters to be assembled in Australia were flown in pieces from France to the Government Aircraft Factories at Avalon, Victoria, by RAAF Hercules.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, pp. 29–30 The same year, following the entry into Australian service of the de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou with No. 38 Squadron, No. 486 Squadron was disbanded and its equipment and staff divided between Nos. 36 and 38 Squadrons.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 424–425 The RAAF's force of twelve C-130A Hercules was augmented by twelve C-130Es commencing in August 1966. No. 37 Squadron, disbanded in 1948, was re-formed at Richmond to operate the new models. No. 486 Squadron was also re-formed to provide maintenance for both Hercules squadrons.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, pp. 100–102 No. 36 Squadron's tasking was mainly domestic and tactical in nature, while No. 37 Squadron's was overseas and strategic, owing to the longer range of its C-130Es. In May 1967, three Hercules of No. 37 Squadron supported Operation Fast Caravan, the deployment of 23 Mirages of No. 75 Squadron to Butterworth.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, pp. 64–66Stephens, Going Solo, p. 267 Vietnam War era During the late 1960s, forty-two per cent of Hercules flying hours were devoted to Australian Army operations.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 320 The C-130s undertook long-range missions to support Australian forces fighting in the Vietnam War from 1965 until 1972. Following the deployment of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment to South Vietnam in early 1965, the RAAF began fortnightly C-130 flights into the country from June that year. These flights were initially conducted by C-130As, and carried high-priority cargo and passengers from Richmond to Vung Tau in South Vietnam via either Butterworth or Singapore.Coulthard-Clark, The RAAF in Vietnam, pp. 244–247 The scale of the supply flights into South Vietnam expanded in 1967 when No. 2 Squadron RAAF, which was equipped with English Electric Canberra bombers, was deployed to Phan Rang. A large airlift codenamed Winter Grip was also conducted in mid-1967 to replace two Australian Army battalions, which had completed their year-long tour of duty, with a pair of fresh battalions.Coulthard-Clark, The RAAF in Vietnam, pp. 247–248 The Hercules were called upon to support the withdrawal of the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) from South Vietnam, and Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons undertook many sorties to fly equipment and personnel out of the country during 1971. In late 1972, C-130s were used to withdraw the last remaining Australian force in South Vietnam, the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam; the final elements of this force departed aboard two Hercules on 20 December 1972.Coulthard-Clark, The RAAF in Vietnam, p. 248 An RAAF nurse tending injured personnel aboard a C-130A during an aeromedical evacuation flight out of South Vietnam in 1966 As well as transport operations, the Hercules flew many evacuation flights out of Vietnam to transfer wounded or sick personnel to Australia, via Butterworth, for further treatment. These flights were initially conducted as part of the regular courier service, and the patients and RAAF nurses had to endure uncomfortable conditions as the aircraft had only rudimentary facilities for personnel on stretchers.Coulthard-Clark, The RAAF in Vietnam, pp. 252–255 Separate evacuation flights began on 1 July 1966, and continued at fortnightly intervals until 1972; more flights were made during periods in which 1 ATF suffered heavy casualties. Although the operation was generally successful, only C-130Es were assigned to this task from May 1967 after an article criticising the use of noisy C-130As to transport wounded personnel was published in The Medical Journal of Australia. The C-130Es provided much more comfortable conditions and were capable of flying directly between South Vietnam and Australia when required. A total of 3,164 patients had been transported to Australia by the time the C-130 evacuation flights ended in early 1972.Coulthard-Clark, The RAAF in Vietnam, pp. 256–258 The Hercules also returned the bodies of servicemen killed in Vietnam to Australia.Wilson, Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service, p. 125 Many of the RAAF's C-130s were redeployed to South Vietnam shortly before the end of the war in 1975. The rapid North Vietnamese advance during the Spring Offensive displaced hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians, and the Australian Government deployed a detachment of Hercules to Saigon in March 1975 as part of an international aid effort coordinated by the United States. This force, which was designated Detachment S, had an average strength of seven C-130s and about one hundred air and ground crew, and was initially used to transport civilian refugees away from the front lines. After South Vietnamese soldiers were reported to have been transported alongside civilians, Prime Minister Gough Whitlam directed that the Hercules were to only carry humanitarian cargo.Bullard, \\"After the Fall\\", pp. 28–29 As the North Vietnamese advanced on Saigon, Detachment S was moved to Bangkok in Thailand, but continued to fly into South Vietnam each day. Overall, Detachment S had carried 1,100 refugees and 900 tonnes of supplies by the end of the war. On 4 and 17 April, aircraft of the detachment flew 271 orphaned children to Bangkok as part of the US-led Operation Babylift.Bullard, \\"After the Fall\\", pp. 29–30 In late April, two of No. 37 Squadron's C-130Es were assigned to the United Nations to transport supplies throughout Southeast Asia; this force was designated Detachment N. The C-130Es began operations on 3 May, and were mainly used to fly supplies into Laos. The aircraft transported cargo between Thailand, Butterworth, Hong Kong and Singapore; by the time this mission ended in early June, the two Hercules had conducted 91 sorties for the UN.Bullard, \\"After the Fall\\", p. 31 Aircraft of Detachment S evacuated Australian embassy personnel from Phnom Penh in Cambodia, as well as Saigon, shortly before they fell to Khmer Rouge and North Vietnamese forces in April 1975, after which the force returned to Australia. Detachment N also evacuated the Australian embassy in Vientiane, Laos, during early June 1975.Bullard, \\"After the Fall\\", pp. 30–31 Post- Vietnam tasks In the years after the end of the Vietnam War, the Hercules continued to take part in military exercises and support overseas peacekeeping commitments. They also became well known in the Southern Pacific after being called on for relief following natural disasters, including tsunami in New Guinea, cyclones in the Solomon Islands and Tonga, and fires and floods in Australia.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 311 The Hercules played a significant part in the evacuation of civilians following Cyclone Tracy in 1974–75; a No. 37 Squadron C-130E was the first aircraft to touch down in Darwin following the disaster. Eight of No. 36 Squadron's aircraft were involved in the relief effort, flying over 550 hours, and carrying 2,864 passengers and almost 800,000 lbs of cargo, while No. 37 Squadron contributed 11 aircraft, flying 700 hours, and carrying 4,400 passengers and 1,300,000 lbs of cargo. On 19 January 1978 a C-130E returning to Australia from Butterworth was used to intercept a drug-smuggling aircraft near Darwin; the smuggler eventually landed at Katherine, and was arrested.Clark; Clarke, First on the Scene, p. 46 After clocking up 147,000 accident-free flying hours over the course of 20 years, No. 36 Squadron's C-130As were replaced in 1978 by C-130H models. The C-130Hs were primarily used as tactical air lifters throughout their service with the RAAF, and worked closely with the Army's special forces units.Pittaway, \\"Airlift evolution\\", p. 13 Soldiers from the 1st Commando Company parachuting with inflatable boats from an RAAF C-130H into Shoalwater Bay, May 2001 The disposal of the C-130As took almost a decade, with the process being subject to a police investigation. Attempts to sell the Hercules by tender during 1978 and 1979 were unsuccessful, and the American law firm Ford and Vlahos was appointed the sales agent for the aircraft in 1981. One was sold to the French Government in 1983 and subsequently transferred to the Chadian Air Force. Another two Hercules were sold to the Colombian charter company Aviaco in 1983, but the US State Department vetoed the deal shortly before it was to have been completed over suspicions that the aircraft would be used to smuggle drugs into the United States. A C-130A was transferred to the newly established company International Air Aid and leased to the International Red Cross to fly humanitarian supplies into Ethiopia during 1986, but this contract was cancelled after the C-130's pilot was accused by the Ethiopian government of photographing a military area. The Australian Federal Police eventually charged two people with defrauding the Commonwealth and conspiracy in relation to these attempts to dispose of the C-130As. Eventually, four of the C-130As were sold to Aboitiz Air Transport Corporation in May 1988 and another four were acquired by the Fowler Aeronautical Corporation the next year. Two of the remaining three aircraft were retained by the RAAF for training and heritage purposes, and the final C-130A was scrapped.Wilson, Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service, pp. 109–113, 150 In November 1978, a C-130H became the first Australian Hercules to land in Antarctica, at McMurdo Sound.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, p. 105 In January–February 1979, two No. 37 Squadron C-130Es evacuated Australian and other foreign embassy staff from Tehran, shortly before the collapse of royal rule during the Iranian Revolution. During April 1982, a C-130H was fitted with aerial firefighting equipment acquired from the United States Forest Service for trials purposes; several Hercules later used this equipment to fight bushfires.Wilson, Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service, p. 129 On 5 April 1983, 23 of the RAAF's Hercules performed a formation flight over Sydney; the remaining aircraft was to have participated in this flight but was diverted to conduct a search-and-rescue task. The Hercules' twelve- hour endurance and ability to drop survival equipment over land or sea made it a useful aircraft for such missions. In 1986, No. 37 Squadron transported the Popemobiles during John Paul II's tour of Australia; its other unusual cargoes have included a Murray Grey stud bull presented to the Chinese Government in 1973, kangaroos and sheep for Malaysia, and archaeological exhibits from China.Clark; Clarke, First on the Scene, p. 35 In February 1987, Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons joined No. 33 Squadron (flying Boeing 707 tanker-transports) as part of a re-formed No. 86 Wing under the newly established Air Lift Group (renamed Air Mobility Group in April 2014).Roylance, Air Base Richmond, pp. 107–108, 116–117 In May that year four C-130s flew a rifle company of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, from Townsville to Norfolk Island during Operation Morris Dance, the Australian Defence Force's response to the first of the 1987 Fijian coups; the soldiers subsequently embarked onto RAN warships by helicopter.Breen, Struggling for Self Reliance, pp. 38–40 In 1988, No. 37 Squadron's Hercules achieved 200,000 accident-free flying hours. No. 36 Squadron achieved 100,000 accident-free flying hours on the C-130H in 1990. Members of the travelling public experienced flying by Hercules in 1989, when the Australian Government employed the C-130s and 707s for transport during the pilots' dispute that curtailed operations by the two domestic airlines; the resulting spike in operational hours necessitated No. 486 Squadron sending detachments to several locations throughout the country to cope with increased maintenance demands.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, pp. 110–111 By the late 1980s, some C-130 maintenance tasks had been outsourced to commercial firms, and Air New Zealand won a four-year depot maintenance contract in 1990.Wilson, Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service, p. 116 Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, No. 86 Wing prepared to deploy five C-130s to the Middle East to evacuate 3,000 Australian citizens from Saudi Arabia in the event that Iraq also attacked that country. An operation to fly about 95 Australians and New Zealanders directly out of Iraq and Kuwait was also planned, but would have only been conducted as a last resort due to the great dangers involved. These evacuation flights were not required as Iraq did not invade Saudi Arabia, and the Australians in Iraq departed by road.Horner, Australia and the 'New World Order, pp. 330–331 A proposal to deploy some of the Hercules as part of Australia's contribution to the ensuing Gulf War was also rejected in late 1990 as the aircraft had to be held in reserve in case fighting on the Pacific island of Bougainville worsened and required an evacuation operation.Horner, Australia and the 'New World Order, p. 383 After Operation Desert Storm commenced in January 1991, two C-130s were dispatched to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean where they were held at readiness to deploy to Saudi Arabia in case Australian citizens had to be evacuated; these aircraft moved to Singapore on 29 January and returned to Australia in early February.Horner, Australia and the 'New World Order, p. 452 Other Hercules flew supplies for the RAN warships in the region from Australia to Muscat, Oman, from January 1991, and also transported a naval Clearance Diving Team to Muscat late in the month.Horner, Australia and the 'New World Order, pp. 449, 460 In 1992, the Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons achieved a grand total of 500,000 accident-free flying hours; Lockheed presented No. 86 Wing with a trophy to commemorate the milestone. RAAF C-130J Hercules, Canberra, 2005 The RAAF's Hercules fleet continued to support Australian military deployments during the 1990s and 2000s. In 1993, C-130s transported Australian troops to and from Somalia as part of Operation Solace. In late July the next year two C-130Hs flew water purifying equipment and medical supplies into Rwanda to assist the survivors of the genocide in that country. Six Hercules evacuated over 450 civilians from Cambodia following the coup in July 1997. No. 37 Squadron re-equipped with new-model C-130J Hercules in 1999; during the transition to the new aircraft the C-130Es were operated by No. 36 Squadron before being retired. The seven C-130Es transferred to Lockheed Martin as part of the C-130J purchase agreement were subsequently sold to Pakistan in 2004. Of these aircraft, six entered service with the Pakistan Air Force and the seventh was scrapped.\\"World Air Forces 2004\\", p. 78 The RAAF's other five C-130Es were retained to be used for ground training and museum purposes.Horner, Making the Australian Defence Force, p. 215 At the end of 1999, No. 86 Wing ceased flying the regularly scheduled intra-Australia C-130 flights that had begun in May 1959. While these courier flights had been one of the main tasks assigned to the Hercules force since the type's introduction, the reduction in commercial airfares during the late 1990s rendered them unnecessary. A detachment of Hercules from Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons supported INTERFET operations in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000. When violence broke out following the East Timor Special Autonomy Referendum on 30 August 1999, C-130H sorties were flown into the then-Indonesian province from 6 to 14 September to evacuate United Nations personnel as well as other foreign citizens and East Timorese refugees. Four C-130E sorties were also conducted to drop food and other humanitarian supplies to refugees on 17 and 18 September.Wilson, Warden to Tanger, pp. 7–10 On 19 September a C-130 dropped a Special Air Service Regiment (SAS) team near the East Timorese capital of Dili ahead of the arrival of the main INTERFET force the next day. From 20 September, thirteen RAAF Hercules (designated No. 86 Wing Detachment B) and transport aircraft from several other countries flew troops and supplies into East Timor. These aircraft also dropped humanitarian supplies to refugees who had fled to mountainous regions. The poor condition of most East Timorese airfields and the potential threat of being fired upon by pro-Indonesian militia were constant dangers throughout this operation.Wilson, Warden to Tanger, pp. 13–19 The support arrangements for the RAAF's Hercules were reformed during 1999 and 2000. On 24 August 1999, the training sections of Nos. 33, 36 and 37 Squadrons and No. 503 Wing were combined to form No. 285 Squadron. This new squadron was assigned responsibility for training aircrew to operate C-130s and Boeing 707s using flight simulators, as well as aircraft temporarily assigned to the unit from the operational squadrons. Retired Hercules have also been used to train loadmasters. In May 2000, heavy maintenance of the C-130s, previously carried out by No. 2 AD (reformed as No. 503 Wing in July 1992) was contracted out to Qantas.RAAF Historical Section, Maintenance Units, pp. 6–9 Since the retirement of the Boeing 707 from RAAF service in June 2008, No. 285 Squadron has been dedicated to C-130 training. Iraq War and recent operations From late 2001, Hercules began flying into Afghanistan to support the SAS squadron deployed as part of Operation Slipper, Australia's contribution to the War in Afghanistan.Londey, \\"War Without Boundaries\\" Five Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons joined relief efforts following the Bali Bombings in October 2002.Clark; Clarke, First on the Scene, p. 96 In February 2003, a detachment of Hercules from No. 36 Squadron was deployed to the Middle East as part of the Australian contribution to the invasion of Iraq. These aircraft arrived on 10 February, and began flying transport sorties twelve days later. The C-130s were the main form of transport used to move Australian personnel and equipment in the theatre before and after the outbreak of fighting on 19 March.Department of Defence, The War in Iraq, p. 29 During the invasion the Hercules supported SAS operations in western Iraq, one being the first Coalition aircraft to land at Al Asad Airbase after it was secured by special forces personnel on 12 April. The C-130s transported supplies and equipment to airstrips in southern Iraq to support the operations of US and British forces.Department of Defence, The War in Iraq, pp. 21, 25, 28 As the first phase of the war wound down, Australian Hercules flew medical supplies into Baghdad shortly after the city was captured.Department of Defence, The War in Iraq, p. 32 A rotating detachment of three Hercules was subsequently maintained in the Middle East to support the ongoing Australian contribution to the War in Afghanistan, as well as the forces stationed in Iraq. The aircraft assigned to this detachment amassed a total of 20,000 operational flying hours by March 2010.McPhedran, Air Force, p. 11 An American contractor travelling on an Australian C-130 in Iraq was killed on 27 June 2004 when the aircraft was struck by gunfire shortly after it took off from Baghdad. A RAAF C-130H Hercules being unloaded at Tallil Air Base, Iraq, in April 2003 RAAF C-130s continued to support operations in and around Australia during the early 2000s. During April 2003 a C-130 formed part of the force that tracked the North Korean freighter Pong Su before it was boarded by special forces personnel off the coast of New South Wales. No. 36 Squadron Hercules took part in Operation Sumatra Assist in the wake of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami; the aircraft were initially used to fly supplies into the badly damaged city of Banda Aceh. Hercules flew Australian forces into East Timor during May 2006 after the government of that country requested assistance to quell a military mutiny and widespread violence.O'Brien, Always There, pp. 223–224 In July that year one of the C-130s deployed to the Middle East was sent to Cyprus, where it picked up Australians who had been evacuated from Lebanon following Israeli air raids and flew them to Turkey.O'Brien, Always There, p. 221 RAAF C-130 operations were concentrated in No. 37 Squadron in November 2006, when No. 36 Squadron transferred its C-130Hs prior to re-equipping with Boeing C-17 Globemaster heavy transports and relocating to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland. The RAAF's contribution to Operation Papua New Guinea Assist following Cyclone Guba in November 2007 included two Hercules, three Caribous, and a Globemaster. In November 2008, the RAAF commemorated fifty years of Hercules operation. From that year only C-130Js were deployed to the Middle East.Pittaway, \\"C-130J upgrade\\", p. 17 Four of the C-130Hs were placed in reserve at Richmond from 2009. Together with Globemasters, Hercules transported medical staff and equipment to aid victims of the Christchurch earthquake in February 2011.McPhedran, Air Force, pp. 237–238 In May 2012 the government announced as part of the 2012–13 Budget that the remaining eight C-130Hs would be withdrawn from service a year earlier than previously scheduled. The aircraft were retired on 30 November that year. Two of the C-130Hs were retained by the Air Force for display at RAAF Museum and for ground training purposes at Richmond; four were donated to the Indonesian Air Force, and the RAAF was reported to be considering options for the disposal of the other six. By the time the C-130H fleet was retired, the twelve aircraft had flown almost 250,000 hours. In April 2013 the Australian government offered to sell five of the C-130Hs as well as spare parts and simulators to Indonesia at below their market value.Jennings, \\"Australia offers surplus C-130s to Indonesia\\" The Indonesian government accepted this deal, and it was finalised on 26 July 2013. The RAAF celebrated 800,000 Hercules flying hours in September 2014. The C-130Js had by this time accumulated over 100,000 hours; they are expected to remain in service until 2030.

It was designed by Charles Phipps and was built during 1889–90 at a cost of £300,000. It was constructed on the former site of the Tivoli Beer Garden and Restaurant.The Tivoli Theatre of Varietiesl, 65-70½ The Strand, London, ArthurLloyd.com, accessed 13 April 2013. In the consortium that financed the project was the actor Edward O'Connor Terry.\\"TIVOLI, Strand\\", Overthefootlights.org, accessed 15 April 2013. The hall opened on 24 May 1890 and was located opposite the Adelphi Theatre.\\"Tivoli Music Hall (London)\\", Theatrestrust.org, accessed 13 April 2013. After a few years, the hall was bought by the impresario Charles Morton, under whose proprietorship, it became one of London's leading music halls. Morton employed, among others: George Robey, Harriet Vernon, Nellie Navette, Harry Randall, Herbert Campbell, Vesta Victoria, the Brothers Griffiths, Ada Blanche, Leo Stormont, Little Tich, Dan Leno and Eugene Stratton. In 1900, the theatre was refurbished and the seating capacity was reduced. On 7 February 1914 the theatre closed for a road widening scheme, but due to the outbreak of World War I this didn't happen immediately, so the theatre stood derelict until it was demolished in 1916.Cinema Treasures: Tivoli Theatre Linked 2017-01-07 The cinema period Several years after the end of World War I, when the Strand had been widened to its present size, it was decided to build a cinema on the site. Theatre architect Bertie Crewe and the architectural firm Gunton & Gunton designed the new Tivoli Picture Theatre, an imposing building in white Portland stone. Inside the auditorium, there were 2,115 seats: 906 seats in the stalls, 637 in the circle and 572 in the balcony. Marketed as the Tivoli Theatre or simply The Tivoli, it opened on 7 September 1923 with the showing of the film Where the Pavement Ends. This was the result of a deal with American Loew's Incorporated, that the Tivoli would present exclusive runs of their films (from Metro Pictures and MGM) concurrent with their American release. The second Tivoli Theatre during the premiere of the 1928 film The Trail of '98 In 1925, the cinema was taken over by MGM/Loew's and was their showcase theatre in London for a few years, until they opened their new Empire Theatre in Leicester Square in November 1928. Tivoli was then sold to Provincial Cinematograph Cinemas (PCT), which soon became part of Gaumont British. During its most popular period, the Tivoli was the big premier cinema in London, showing the very first sound short films in 1925, as well as the epic Ben Hur starring Ramon Novarro, which showed twice daily to a total of 1.2 million spectators. It also premiered Samuel Goldwyn's first \\"talkie\\", Bulldog Drummond starring Ronald Colman, which was a huge hit in August 1929. However, as newer cinemas opened around Leicester Square, Tivoli lost its premier status, and in 1938 it became a second-run weekly change house. The cinema remained in business for over 30 years but eventually closed in 1957 and was demolished and replaced by a department store, which was later converted into New South Wales House for the Australian Government. In the late 1990s, New South Wales House was demolished and replaced by an office block.

Chow, Patronage and Power: Studies on Social Networks in Corinth (Sheffield Academic Press, 1992), p. 66. and the procurator for whom he had worked.John F. Donahue, The Roman Community at Table During the Principate (University of Michigan Press, 2004), p. 85. It is known from a lengthy inscription,Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum 6.10214 = Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae 7213. dated March 11, 153 AD, that preserves the statute (lex) under which the college was constituted.Donahue, The Roman Community at Table, pp. 85–86. The college was located on the Appian Way on the outskirts of Rome,Richard Duncan-Jones, The Economy of the Roman Empire: Quantitative Studies (Cambridge University Press, 1982, 2nd ed.), p. 131. between the first and second milestones near the oldest Temple of Mars at Rome.Roger D. Woodard, Indo-European Sacred Space: Vedic and Roman Cult (University of Illinois Press, 2006), p. 138. In addition to its commemorative purpose, the college served as a burial society and dining club for its members.Richard S. Ascough, Paul's Macedonian Associations (Mohr Siebeck, 2003), p. 45. Purpose Head of Aesculapius from the Palatine Hill (latter 2nd century AD) The college was founded by Salvia Marcellina, the mater (female chief patron) of the college, to preserve the memory of her husband, Marcus Ulpius Capito, and the procurator Flavius Apollonius, for whom he had worked. Capito is commemorated in the inscription as maritus optimus piissimus, \\"best and most devoted husband\\". Apollonius had overseen the art galleries (pinacothecae) at the imperial palace.Donahue, The Roman Community at Table, p. 85. According to the inscription, the building in which the college was housed took the form of a shrine (aedicula) and pergola, with an attached covered solarium. It had a marble statue of Aesculapius, a god of healing. The cult of Aesculapius and Hygia had come to Rome in 293 BC. Although Hygia had been officially recognized as the counterpart of Roman Salus (\\"Health, Wellbeing, Salvation, Security\\") in 180 BC, she was rarely cultivated apart from Aesculapius, and her devotees at Rome were typically Greek.Harold Lucius Axtell, The Deification of Abstract Ideas in Roman Literature and Inscriptions (University of Chicago Press, 1907), pp. 14–15. The collegium also had an obligation to take part in Imperial cult by observing the birthday of the reigning emperor, Antoninus Pius. The name of Flavius Apollonius, the procurator who was the joint honoree of the college, indicates that he was a freedman of a Flavian emperor, most likely Domitian. Commemoration of the emperor's birthday was the only observance required of the college that specifies a site other than its headquarters: in templo Divorum in aede divi Titi, \\"in the shrine (aedes) of the divinized Titus within the precinct (templum) of the Divine [Emperors] (Divi)\\". This cultic link between Aesculapius–Hygia and the Temple of Vespasian and Titus is one of several indications that the divinized Flavii were also regarded as healers.Robert E.A. Palmer, \\"Paean and Paeanists of Serapis and the Flavian Emperors,\\" in Nomodeiktes: Greek Studies in Honor of Martin Ostwald (University of Michigan Press, 1993), pp. 360–361. Funding The college was established by an endowment of 50,000 sesterces (HS) from Salvia Marcellina,Duncan-Jones, The Economy of the Roman Empire, p. 364. who also provided the building for its meetings.Donahue, The Roman Community at Table, pp. 85–86. An additional grant of 10,000 HS for memorial dinners was made by Publius Aelius Zeno, the brother of Salvia's deceased husband and a pater (male patron) of the college.Donahue, The Roman Community at Table, p. 85. The charter stipulated that the college would operate as a lender, and fund its expenses through interest charges on amounts borrowed from its capital endowment.Peter Temin, The Roman Market Economy (Princeton University Press, 2013), p. 175. Membership The college was limited to sixty members, and admitted new members only to replace those who had died. The membership fee was half the funeraticium, a publicly funded burial allowance of 250 HS instituted under the emperor Nerva (reigned 96–98 AD) for the Roman plebs.Duncan-Jones, The Economy of the Roman Empire, p. 131. A member could bequeath his place to his son or brother, or to one of his freedmen (liberti).John Bodel, \\"From Columbaria to Catacombs: Collective Burial in Pagan and Christian Rome,\\" in Commemorating the Dead: Texts and Artifacts in Context (Walter de Gruyter, 2008), p. 187. At the time of its founding, the president of the college (quinquennalis) was Gaius Ofilius Hermes. Some members were immunes, exempt from fees. Others were curatores, \\"caretakers\\". The body of regular members was the populus, \\"the people\\".Donahue, The Roman Community at Table, p. 87. Meetings and benefits Like other collegia, the College of Aesculapius and Hygia would have a monthly business meeting (conventus) at which a dinner was served.John F. Donahue, \\"Toward a Typology of Roman Public Feasting,\\" in Roman Dining (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005), p. 105. The college celebrated the birthday of Antoninus Pius on September 19 Two types of distributions for members were funded: sportulae, \\"handouts\\" in the form of cash gifts; and four occasions when sportulae were accompanied by bread and wine for a meal:Duncan-Jones, The Economy of the Roman Empire, p. 364. the \\"love feast\\" on February 22 when Roman families commemorated their beloved dead; a \\"Violet Day\\" on March 22; a \\"Rose Day\\" on May 11; and the founding of the college on November 8. The full cycle of events was:Donahue, \\"Toward a Typology of Roman Public Feasting,\\" p. 105. * January 8, strenae, gifts given at the end of the New Year celebrations * February 22, Cara Cognatio * March 14, a dinner (cena) presented by the quinquennalis * March 22, Dies Violaris * May 11, Dies Rosalis * September 19, sportulae commemorating the birthday (dies natalis) of Antoninus Pius * November 8, the natalis collegi. The Dies Violaris and Rosalis are flower festivals during the blooming season of violets and roses when tombs were adorned with garlands.C.R. Phillips, The Oxford Classical Dictionary, edited by Simon Hornblower and Anthony Spawforth (Oxford University Press, 1996, 3rd edition), p. 1335. Sportulae were distributed on a benefits scale based on the member's place in the college hierarchy, and the amounts also varied by occasion. For the emperor's birthday, the patrons (mater and pater) and the quinquennalis each received 12 HS, the immunes and curatores 8 HS, and the regular members 4 HS.Donahue, The Roman Community at Table, pp. 86–89. Significance The lex or statute by which the college was constituted was approved on March 11, 153 AD.Donahue, The Roman Community at Table, p. 85. The inscription that preserves it (Lex Collegi Aesculapi et Hygiae) is one of the most important pieces of evidence in understanding the various collegia organized among Rome's lower classes, most of which were focused on a trade or a deity.Donahue, \\"Toward a Typology of Roman Public Feasting,\\" pp. 104–105. Voluntary associations and confraternities were an important part of social life in the Roman Empire, particularly for those whose personal resources were limited. In addition to burial societies and drinking and dining clubs, inscriptions and other documents attest to the regulated existence of numerous professional and trade guilds, performing arts troupes, veterans' groups, and religious sodalities (sodalitates).Michael Peachin, introduction to The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 17, 20; Fergus Millar, \\"Empire and City, Augustus to Julian: Obligations, Excuses and Status,\\" Journal of Roman Studies 73 (1983), pp. 81–82.

She was the eldest daughter of Petronilla, Countess of Bigorre and her third husband Guy de Monfort.Alfonse de Poitou Correspondance Tome II, 2087, p. 597. Alice was married twice during her lifetime and from her first marriage, she gained the title of Lady of Chabanais.GASCONY, Medieval Lands Life Alice was born sometime between 1217 and 1220. She was the eldest child of her mother, she had one full sister also named Petronilla, who went on to marry Raoul de la Roche-Tesson. Her mother was married five times, her elder two daughters were the product of her third marriage. A fifth marriage to Boson of Mastas, Seigneur de Cognac, produced a half-sister named Martha, who married Gaston VII, Viscount of Béarn. Alice was cared for by her uncle, Amaury de Montfort, while he had her mother remarried. By the time of Petronilla's fifth marriage and the birth of her daughter Martha, she needed a stronger union so had Alice married off to Jordan, Lord of Chabanais, a relative of Boson of Mastas.Merlet ´Procès´, pg. 307. An agreement was reached, upon Petronilla's death, Alice and Jordan would inherit Bigorre, whilst Martha would inherit her father's lands of Mastas. By 1247, Jordan had died and so Alice was left with their three children. She married for a second time to Raoul de Courtenay during 1247.Merlet ´Procès´, Pièces Justificatives, X, p. 318, quoting Cartulaire de Bigorre, ch. 21, 24. The couple had a daughter named Matilda who later married Philip of Chieti. Reign In 1251, Petronilla died. However, she had passed control of the government over to Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, Alice's uncle. De Montfort had interpreted this act as a gift, so refused to hand Bigorre over to Alice on the death of her mother.Dictionnaire de la conversation et de la lecture, 2nd Edition, Vol.3, Ed. William Duckett, (Aux Comptoirs de la Direction, 1856), 200. Alice and her husband appealed to her half-sister Martha and her husband Gaston VII, Viscount of Béarn to help re-claim Bigorre, they accepted. To prevent Guyenne and Gascony from rebelling, Henry III of England recalled Simon de Montfort and appointed John Grailly in his place. However, Alice and her family re-claimed Bigorre during 1251. Alice reigned only for the next four years, dying in 1255. She was succeeded by her eldest son. However, following Alice's death, De Montfort did attempt to challenge her son for control of Bigorre once again. Upon Eskivat's death, control of Bigorre was disputed between Alice's sister Martha and her daughter Laura, with the latter eventually succeeding. Issue The marriage between Alice and Jordan produced three children: *Eskivat (died 1283), succeeded his mother, married Mascarós II d'Armagnac, Countess of Armagnac and Fézensac but had no children. *Jordan (died before 1283) named as heir to his brother but predeceased him *Laura (c.1240-1316), fought with her aunt Martha for control of Bigorre on the death of her brother. Married firstly to Simon of Rochechouart, lord of Availles, and secondly to Viscount Raymond V of Turenne. Laura had three children, all by her first marriage.

Harvey (born 1947) is an English historian, novelist and hoaxer. He originated a hoax claiming that Charles Dickens met Fyodor Dostoyevsky.  Early life and education  Born in and brought up in Colchester, A. D. Harvey read Modern History under Keith Thomas at St John's College, Oxford, and obtained his Ph.D. in History at Cambridge only six years after sitting his G.C.E. A-levels, being a member of University College, now Wolfson College. In a letter to The Times Literary Supplement, he stated that \\"practically everyone [he] met while an undergraduate 1966–69\\" was \\"bored, frustrated and above all disillusioned by an Oxford that was so much more mundane than their school daydreams\\". His first novel, Oxford: The Novel, published in 1981 under the pseudonym 'Leo Bellingham' by his own imprint, Nold Jonson Books, fictionalises his time as an undergraduate. It is peppered with erotically charged scenes and attacks on the Oxford student left.  Academic career  Harvey has taught at the universities of Cambridge, Salerno, La Réunion and Leipzig. He has written several academic monographs dealing with aspects of English cultural, social and military history. Kathryn Hughes called him \\"a master of the concrete, the adroit displayer of the precious scrap of hard fact\\". At times his works have been described by reviews as somewhat encyclopaedic and lacking in analysis, though Andrew Roberts in The Times wrote of his \\"academically immaculate analyses\\". He was briefly editor of the journal Salisbury Review. He has also contributed to History Today magazine and BBC History Magazine on subjects including Napoleon, the boroughs of London, Gustav III of Sweden, Engelbert Dollfuss, Churchill on Rollerskates and the Stuka dive-bomber. He has made contributions to specialist journals on aspects of air warfare. Harvey has published under many pseudonyms and in 2013 was identified as the author of a 2002 article (attributed to a \\"Stephanie Harvey\\") falsely claiming that Charles Dickens and Fyodor Dostoevsky met in 1862. The account of this meeting and the supposed insight into Dickens' character and literary motivations revealed in a – wholly fictitious – letter by Dostoevsky was subsequently quoted in a number of scholarly articles and books, including major biographies of Dickens. The hoax, along with Harvey's record of pseudonymous publications and falsified citations, was exposed in an April 2013 article in the Times Literary Supplement by Eric Naiman, Professor of Comparative Literature & Department Chair of Slavic Languages and Literatures at University of California, Berkeley.  Literary career  Besides Oxford: the Novel, Harvey has also published another novel called Warriors of the Rainbow, a work of science-fiction about a reanimated woman and her lover in a world controlled by a shadowy cadre of whales. It was described by The Guardian as \\"weirdly compelling\\" and by The Independent as \\"free flowing and poetic\\". He is also a published poet (Sonnets 2006) and letter writer to the literary journals of the United Kingdom.

She was previously provost (chief academic officer) and interim president of Dartmouth College and was the first woman to lead UNC.Stancil, Jane; Blythe, Anne. UNC- CH names Carol Folt first female chancellor . The News & Observer, April 13, 2013. On January 14, 2019, she announced her resignation as UNC chancellor.  Early life and career  A native of Akron, Ohio, Folt is the granddaughter of immigrants from Albania. She graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1976 with a bachelor's degree in aquatic biology. She earned a master's degree in biology from the same institution in 1978, and a doctorate in ecology from the University of California, Davis in 1982. After conducting postdoctoral studies at the Kellogg Biological Station at Michigan State University, she joined Dartmouth in 1983 as a research instructor in biological sciences, and has conducted extensive research in metal toxicity. Since 2007, she has held an endowed professorship in biological sciences.Folt named Carolina chancellor. UNC Press Office, April 12, 2013. Folt joined Dartmouth's administration in 2001, when she was named dean of graduate studies and associate dean of the faculty. She became dean of the faculty in 2004. She was tapped as acting provost in 2009, and appointed provost in 2010. When Dartmouth president Jim Yong Kim was named as president of the World Bank in July 2012, Folt was named acting president.  Chancellor of UNC  Folt was chosen as UNC's chancellor by the Board of Governors of the UNC System to succeed Holden Thorp, who resigned the position in June 2013 amid allegations of widespread academic fraud. She described her selection as \\"the honor of a lifetime\\" and vowed to ensure that UNC's students \\"don't simply learn what we know but they learn how to create what will be.\\"  Academic-athletic scandal  Under Chancellor Folt's direction, UNC spent approximately 18 million dollars defending itself from NCAA sanctions for prolonged and widespread fraud within academic and athletics departments, the details of which were outlined in Wainstein Report. The Report summarizes the findings of an independent investigation conducted by former federal prosecutor Kenneth Wainstein. It describes abuses spanning over 18 years (during the tenures of Chancellor Michael Hooker, Chancellor James Moeser, Chancellor Holden Thorp), including \\"no-show\\" classes that had little to no faculty oversight. Approximately half of the enrollees in these \\"no-show\\" classes were athletes. When the Wainstein Report was released in 2014, Folt acknowledged \\"It is just very clear that it was an academic issue with the way the courses were administered, and it is clearly an athletics issue.\\" The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the regional accreditation body for UNC, took the nearly unprecedented step of placing UNC on a year of probation, wherein any further missteps would lead to the university's accreditation being removed, effectively dooming the entire university. Folt brought forth reforms on several levels, and the probation was consequently lifted with no further sanctions after a year. While not nearly as important for the well-being of the university as a whole, UNC also faced the possibility of serious sanctions from the NCAA. Under Folt's leadership, the University later went on to deny that the academic fraud was specifically benefiting athletics in its defense to the NCAA, broadly attempting to insulate the UNC administration from the findings of the Wainstein Report and the allegations of UNC whistleblower Mary Willingham. One of the key assertions the University made in its own defense was that the NCAA did not have jurisdiction, since the University created and offered \\"no-show\\" courses not as part of a systemic effort to benefit athletes, but the student body in general. While citing the failure of multiple UNC administrators to cooperate with the investigation, the NCAA's Committee on Infractions did not hold UNC responsible, finding that \\"no-show\\" classes were not specifically designed to benefit athletes. This finding led both fans and media across the country to question \\"the integrity of the NCAA, suggesting that UNC's case would open the doors for other universities to set up similar no-show classes so long as non-athletes could enroll.\\"  Silent Sam monument controversy  During her term as Chancellor, Folt had to deal with the controversy over the monument Silent Sam, which at times included demonstrators outside her office. Folt resigned as chancellor on January 14, 2019, effective end of the spring semester, stating: \\"There has been too much recent disruption due to the monument controversy\\". In the same letter, she ordered the remaining plinth (pedestal) to be removed, as a threat to campus safety. Later, the University of North Carolina system Board of Governors made her resignation effective January 31.  Personal life  Folt is married to fellow Dartmouth professor David Peart; they have two children.

His research focuses on circadian rhythmicity of vertebrates, including contributing to an understanding of light input pathways on extra-retinal photoreceptors of non-mammalian vertebrates, discovering a mammalian mutation for circadian rhythmicity (tau mutation in golden hamsters), and locating a circadian oscillator in the pineal gland of bird. He has written almost 200 scientific publications.\\"Using PubMed.\\" National Center for Biotechnology Information. U.S. National Library of Medicine, n.d. Web. 23 Apr. 2013 Early life and education Menaker grew up in New York City and attended Swarthmore College. After graduating from Swarthmore College in 1955 with a B.A. in Biology, Menaker went on to Princeton University. In the lab of Colin Pittendrigh, the father of research on biological clocks, Menaker studied the endogenous circadian rhythm of bats (Myotis lucifugus). He graduated from Princeton University with a Ph.D. in 1960, and continued postdoctoral studies in Donald Griffin's lab at Harvard University. As he continued to study bats, his interest shifted from circadian rhythms to hibernation patterns. When Menaker joined faculty at University of Texas at Austin in 1962, he transitioned to studying circadian rhythms in the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) and the golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). Academic career Menaker has held academic positions at the University of Texas, University of Oregon, and presently, at University of Virginia, where he has been the Commonwealth Professor of Biology since 1987. He served as Chairman of the Biology Department at Virginia from 1987-1993. He has mentored several experts in the field of chronobiology, including Joseph Takahashi,http://conte.genomics.northwestern.edu/menaker.html Chair of the Neuroscience Department at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; Heidi Hamm, Chair of the Pharmacology Department at Vanderbilt University; and Carl Johnson Professor of Biological Sciences at Vanderbilt University. He has authored almost 200 papers and maintained grant funding to support his research for over 60 years. Scientific work Discovery of extra-retinal photoreceptor(s) in the house sparrow In 1968, Menaker provided evidence for the existence of extra-retinal photoreceptors that were sufficient for photoentrainment by measuring rhythmic locomotor behavior as the output signal of the house sparrows (Passer domesticus) circadian clock. He demonstrated that photoentrainment could occur in the absence of optic neurons, evidence for the presence of an extra-retinal photoreceptor(s) coupled to the House Sparrow circadian clock.Bellingham, James, and Russell G. Foster. Opsins and mammalian photoentrainment. Cell and Tissue Research 309.1 (2002): 57-71. In this experiment, bilaterally enucleated house sparrows were exposed to an artificial light-dark cycle. They were kept in constant darkness to determine their free-running period and subsequently allowed to entrain to light cues. Locomotor activity was recorded through observing perching behavior of the sparrows. He tested three possible confounding variables for entrainment: (1) temperature fluctuation, (2) post-enucleation retinal fragments remaining in the eye, and (3) ectoparasites that might transfer light information through their movements in the birds' skin. To study the effects of temperature on circadian rhythms, Menaker exposed the enucleated sparrows to an electroluminescent panel. Menaker treated sparrows with Dry-Die, an anti- parasitic agent, to eliminate any possible effects of light transferring by ectoparasites. Since the sparrows did not entrain during tests of temperature fluctuation and the sparrows remained entrained 10 months after enucleation, a point at which any excess of the functional retina would have degraded, Menaker ruled out these possible confounding variables.Menaker, Michael. Extraretinal Light Perception in Sparrow, I. Entrainment of the Biological Clock\\" Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1968, Feb 15; 59(2): 414-421. Menaker's lab concluded the sparrows were able to entrain to environmental light cues. These results demonstrate that retinal light receptors are not necessary for photoentrainment, indicating there is an extra-retinal photoreceptor(s) contributing to circadian locomotor activity. Menaker's findings in enucleated sparrows were consistent with Aschoff's Rule, and he concluded that the retinae and the extra-retinal receptor(s) both contribute to the photoentrainment process. Pineal gland as a location for circadian oscillator in the house sparrow In 1979, Menaker and Natille Headrick Zimmerman expanded on Menaker's previous work with house sparrows, by exploring the influence of the pineal gland and hypothalamus on circadian rhythms. They transplanted the pineal tissue of one sparrow into the anterior chamber of the eyes of an arrhythmic, pinealectomized sparrow. Prior to the transplantation procedure, the donor birds were entrained to a 12:12 light:dark photoperiod cycle. This allowed them to compare the onset of activity, measured by perching patterns, of the donors before pineal transplantation and the recipients after transplantation. Upon receiving pineal tissue transplantation, previously arrhythmic sparrows experienced the reestablishment of rhythmicity. In fact, their reestablished circadian oscillations resembled the circadian oscillation pattern for locomotor activity of the donor sparrows. The 20% of the sparrows who had successful transplantations showed temporary arrhythmicity in constant darkness for a period of 10 to 100 days, which was not always evenly distributed in the 24-hour day; the sparrows, however, eventually became rhythmic once again.Zimmerman N.H., Menaker M. The pineal gland: A pacemaker within the circadian system of the house sparrow. Proc Natl Acad. Sci USA. 1979, Feb; 76(2): 999-1003. Menaker concluded the pineal gland is a driving oscillator within a multi-component system. Discovery of the tau mutation in golden hamsters In 1988, Martin Ralph and Menaker serendipitously came across a tau mutant male golden hamster in a shipment from their commercial supplier, Charles River Laboratories, that was observed to have a circadian period significantly shorter than what is characteristic of that breed. These golden hamsters are recognized for their narrow range of periods with a typical mean of 24 hours.Pittendrigh, C.S., Daan, S. A Functional Analysis of Circadian Pacemakers in Nocturnal Rodents. J. Comp. Physiol. 1976;106:333-355. Thus, rather than overlooking this abnormal male hamster, Menaker conducted breeding experiments to produce homozygous tau mutants with a period of 20 hours and heterozygous tau mutants with a period of 22 hours. The pattern of inheritance from this shortened tau indicated the genetic cause of this phenotype was isolated to a single allele, providing a genetic approach to the determination of the biological mechanism. This accidental forward genetic screen yielded the first specimen that could be studied for genetic insight into mammalian circadian mechanisms. The first major finding with this strain was that the oscillator had to be located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). To test this conclusion, Menaker and colleagues conducted experiments whereby the SCN from a tau mutant hamster was transplanted through a neural graft to a wild- type hamster with an ablated SCN. After this procedure, the formerly wild-type hamster displayed a shortened period which resembled the tau mutant. This result led to the conclusion that the SCN is sufficient and necessary for mammalian circadian rhythms.Ralph, M.R., Foster, R.G., Davis, F.C. Menaker, M. Transplanted Suprachiasmatic Nucleus Determines Circadian Period\\" Science 1990, Feb 23;247(4945):975-8. Further investigation of the SCN as a central structure of circadian rhythms by Silver, et al. found that the SCN can control circadian rhythmicity by a diffusive signal. They transplanted the SCN as previously done by Menaker, but they encapsulated the graft thus preventing outgrowth by mutant SCN neurons. Even with the SCN restrained in this way the wild type hamster displayed a shorter period consistent with the period of the SCN donated by the mutant tau hamster, suggesting the SCN emits diffusable factors to control circadian rhythms.Silver, Rae, et al. \\"A diffusible coupling signal from the transplanted suprachiasmatic nucleus controlling circadian locomotor rhythms.\\" Nature 382.6594 (1996): 810-813. That same year, Gianluca Tosini and Menaker also determined that hamster retinas cultured in vitro produced a consistent circadian rhythm, as measured by melatonin levels.Tosini, Gianluca, and Michael Menaker. \\"Circadian rhythms in cultured mammalian retina.\\" Science 272.5260 (1996): 419-421. This suggests that there are multiple oscillators, or multiple neurons that compose a single oscillator sufficient for circadian outputs. Molecular identification of the tau locus It was still uncertain as to exactly which genetic locus the tau mutation was found, and which protein it affected. In 2000, Menaker collaborated with other scientists in the field to use genetically directed representational difference analysis (GDRDA), a new technique in molecular genetics that allowed them to accomplish this goal.Lowrey, Phillip L., et al. \\"Positional syntenic cloning and functional characterization of the mammalian circadian mutation tau.\\" Science 288.5465 (2000): 483-491. GDRDA works by first generating polymorphic genetic markers for a monogenic trait (which the tau has already been proven to be) that can be directly identified in the genome. This is done by separating progeny from a cross, based on the phenotype of interest and then creating amplicons of pooled DNA from each group. With these groups of amplified DNA, it can be determined which loci are enriched in the group exhibiting the phenotype of interest. These enriched loci are the genetic markers for the trait of interest. The genetic markers for the tau mutants mapped to chromosome 22. The region of conserved synteny was the gene casein kinase I epsilon (CKIe). This is consistent with CKIe's homology to the Drosophila circadian control gene doubletime (dbt). From this work it was also shown that CK1e could interact with the mammalian PERIOD protein in vitro and effect the expression of Per1. From this work, the Takahashi lab successfully validated the tau mutant genetically by discovering the affected locus and subsequently established a model of circadian protein interaction by which the effects of the tau mutation could be explained. Establishing methamphetamine-sensitive circadian oscillator (MASCO) in mice Although previous studies demonstrate that methamphetamine (MAP) has a significant effect on the circadian behavior of rats, suggesting evidence of the SCN-independent, MAP-sensitive circadian oscillator (MASCO), Menaker and colleagues chose to look at MASCO in mice.Honma, S., Yasuda, T., Yasui, A., van der Horst, G.T.J., Honma, K. Circadian Behavioral Rhythms in Cry1/Cry2 Double-Deficient Mice Induced by Methamphetamine. Biol Rhythms. 2008, Feb; 23(1): 91-94. The work done by Menaker and colleagues looked at the effects of chronic MAP expression on two strains of intact and SCN-lesioned mice in constant dark and constant light conditions. MAP in the drinking water generated circadian locomotor rhythmicity in SCN lesioned mice. When MAP was removed, the free-running locomotor rhythm persisted for as long as fourteen cycles. This study also showed that small increases in MAP caused an increase in daily wheel-running activity and the length of the circadian period for intact mice and SCN-lesioned mice in constant dark and constant light conditions. The observations of Menaker and colleagues indicate that MASCO, a circadian oscillator, functions separately from the \\"master clock\\" of the SCN and is sufficient for locomotor circadian rhythm control. This study disproves the \\"hourglass\\" mechanism hypothesis for MASCO proposed by Ruis, et al. This hypothesis states that the spontaneous consumption of MAP in drinking water by rodents results in lengthened bouts of activity, followed by sleep. The cycle is reinforced when the animal awakes and drinks once more.Ruis, J.F., Buys, J.P., Cambras, T., Rietveld W.J. Effects of t cycles of light/darkness and periodic forced activity on methamphetamine-induced rhythms in intact and SCN- lesioned rats: Explanation by an hourglass-clock model. Physiol Behav. 1990; 47:917-929 Menaker and colleagues tested SCN-lesioned, arrhythmic mice in constant darkness and found that when the MAP was no longer consumed at rhythmic intervals, constant rhythms in locomotor behavior were still found. In another trial, MAP was alternated every other day with water, and locomotor rhythm persisted on days with just the water. Both of these findings made clear that the \\"hourglass\\" hypothesis for the mechanism of MASCO was not valid.Tataroglu Ö., Davidson A.J., Benvenuto L.J., Menaker M. The Methamphetamine-Sensitive Circadian Oscillator (MASCO) in Mice. Bio Rhythms. 2006, Jun; 21(3): 185-194. Molecular mechanism of MASCO Menaker and colleagues investigated if MASCO affected the molecular feedback loop underlying the currently accepted model for circadian rhythmicity in mammals. This investigation was done by treating arrhythmic mice lacking or with mutations to various genes in this feedback loop with MAP dosages. These genes included mutations and deletions to Per1, Per2, Cry1, Cry2, Bmal1, Npas2, CLOCK and CK1e. All of these mutants continued to respond and exhibit changes in free-running rhythms in the presence of MAP, despite mutational breaks in the feedback loop for circadian oscillation. In these arrhythmic animals, regardless of mutation or knockout of critical clock genes, MAP restored rhythm of circadian properties. This suggests that the molecular mechanism for MASCO is radically different from the known and accepted circadian oscillation model in mammals, and the feedback loop is not necessary for the generation of circadian locomotor rhythmicity by MAP.Mohawk J.A., Baer M.L., Menaker M. The methamphetamine-sensitive circadian oscillator does not employ canonical clock genes\\" Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2009, Mar 3; 1006(9): 3519-2. Current work Menaker's current lab group at University of Virginia is focused on the organization of circadian systems in vertebrates. The lab is working with a transgenic rat model with Per1 gene linked to a luciferase reporter to track the circadian expression patterns of the Per1 gene in brain and peripheral tissues. They anticipate this data to address if the clocks in all tissues remain in synchrony with a change in light cycle, and the clock-related signals from the brain to peripheral tissues . Recently, Menaker discovered another mutant hamster, this time showing a free-running period of 25 hours in conditions of constant darkness.Menaker, Michael. Personal interview. 11 April 2013. Menaker's graduate student, Ashli Moore, was a teaching assistant in his colleague's animal behavior course when an undergraduate student insisted on trading in her hamster for one that had a period more closely resembling that of her classmates' hamsters. Menaker bred this mutant hamster with three different females to produce litters with Mendalian ratios of wild-type and heterozygous mutants. He subsequently bred homozygous mutants with a free- running period of 28 hours. Menaker's lab is currently in collaboration with Carla Green's molecular biology lab at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center to study this mutant hamster line further.

They include gneiss, greenstone, schist-amphibolite and granitoids. These older rocks are overlain by sedimentary rocks of Mesozoic, Neogene and Quaternary age in the west and along the coast. The islands of Pagalu and Bioko (Annobon and Fernando Poo) are of relatively recent volcanic origin, forming a part of the Cameroon Volcanic Line.  Tectonics  The Meso- and Cenozoic formation of the Atlantic rifting event show pre-, syn-, and post-rift tectono sedimentary units.  Economic geology  There is no significant amount of mineral extraction in Equatorial Guinea. Artisanal gold mining occurs in rivers that come from the Precambrian rocks of the Río Muni. Additional minerals mined are: diamonds, coltan, iron, bauxite, tin, and tungsten In contrast, Equatorial Guinea is the fourth leading exporter of petroleum in Africa, which contributes significantly to the country's GDP. The country is also seventh in Africa for production of crude oil and the ninth largest producer of natural gas. The reserves are estimated at 150 Mt and 36.81 billion m3, respectively. An increase of production of crude oil has had a significant positive impact on Equatorial Guinea's economy. Since Equatorial Guinea relies so heavily on crude oil, the crude oil price drops in 2009 and 2014 had a measurable effect on the economy.  Geohazards  Volcanic eruptions may occur on the islands of Bioko and Pagalú. Three amalgamated strato-volcanoes exist on Bioko.

It defended London during the Blitz. Origin The former Duke of York's Headquarters in Chelsea, London German air raids by Zeppelin airships and Gotha bombers on London and other British cities during World War I had shown the need for strong anti-aircraft (AA) defences in any future war. When the Territorial Army (TA) was reformed in 1922 it included a number of dedicated AA units of the Royal Artillery (RA) and Royal Engineers (RE). Two formations were organised in London District to command these units, provisionally known as the 2nd and 3rd London Air Defence Brigades, but soon numbered 26th and 27th. Both were based at the Duke of York's Headquarters in Chelsea, where the units of the 2nd AD Bde were accommodated in buildings used before World War I by King Edward's Horse and the Royal Army Service Corps divisional train of the 47th (1/2nd London) Division. Extra buildings erected for the units included gun drill sheds and a store for each battery. Meanwhile, 3rd AD Bde's units were based at Lytton Grove, Putney, taking over pre-war buildings previously used by the City of London Yeomanry (Rough Riders).War Office to HM Treasury 19 February 1923, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file T 161/32/3.

The 26th AD Bde was reorganised at Chelsea on 16 December 1935 as 26th (London) Anti-Aircraft Group, commanding all the gun and searchlight units of the two former brigades, while the 27th was reformed as 27th (Home Counties) Anti- Aircraft Group at RAF Kenley, to command new AA units in the South London suburbs.Frederick, pp. 1048–50.Monthly Army List January 1936.Routledge, p. 59. The AA Groups took the more usual formation title of Brigades on 1 January 1939 after the Royal Artillery replaced its traditional unit designation 'Brigade' by the modern 'Regiment'.Routledge, p. 60. Mobilisation Robert Whittaker, OBE, TD, commander of 26th (London) AA Brigade, 1939–40. The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis. The call-out of key parties by telephone and telegram went well, and they assembled at their drill halls within a few hours. Because the units possessed only a small scale of transport, elaborate plans had been made to requisition civilian vehicles, ranging from heavy lorries to buses and private cars. Equipment was drawn from mobilisation stores, and the detachments ferried out to their war stations. Despite some failures and problems, the emergency positions covering London were manned and most of the equipment was in place within 24 hours. The emergency mobilisation lasted nearly three weeks before the TA units were released on 14 October.Routledge, pp. 62–3. Brigadier Robert Whittaker, a TA officer who had commanded 53rd (City of London) HAA Rgt, was appointed to command the brigade on 18 January 1939.Monthly Army ListWhittaker at Generals of World War II. During this period of tension the Territorial Army grew enormously, and existing TA infantry battalions continued to be converted to AA regiments. The number of divisions and brigades was expanded, and the whole AA defence of the United Kingdom was taken over by Anti-Aircraft Command on 1 April 1939. A new 38th Light Anti-Aircraft Brigade was formed on 28 September 1938 by duplicating 26 AA Brigade HQ at the Duke of York's Headquarters. The new brigade took responsibility for searchlight units in the London area, leaving 26 AA Bde as a Heavy AA formation. The further deterioration in international relations during 1939 led to a partial mobilisation in June, and a proportion of TA AA units manned their war stations under a rotation system known as 'Couverture'. Full mobilisation of AA Command came in August 1939, ahead of the declaration of war on 3 September 1939.Routledge, p. 65. 206 Brompton Road, the former Brompton Road tube station closed in 1934, used as the headquarters of the London Inner Artillery Zone anti-aircraft defences during World War II Just before the outbreak of war, 26 AA Bde moved its headquarters to Brompton Road in South Kensington, where a Piccadilly line underground railway station had been disused since 1934. 1st AA Division established a control centre at Brompton Road, where the tunnels, subways and lift-shafts were adapted to provide bomb-proof accommodation for a Central Operation Room reporting direct to HQ No. 11 Group RAF at Uxbridge, and four Gun Operations Rooms (GORs) subdividing the London Inner Artillery Zone (IAZ). An elaborate network of dedicated telephone lines was laid by the General Post Office and Royal Corps of Signals, linking the AA sites, including many isolated searchlight positions.Routledge, pp. 387–9.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot FilesOsborne p. 101.Halliday, p. 165. (The building remained a TA centre after the war, later being known as the Signals Drill Hall. It was sold by the Ministry of Defence in 2014.)'London's Brompton Road Tube station sold for £53m', BBC News London, 28 Feb 2014. It had been intended that 26th AA Brigade would control the whole London IAZ, but it proved too complex for one HQ, and in September 1939 it was divided among three: 26th, 48th and 49th AA Bdes. 26th AA Brigade still had the heaviest concentration of guns, with 34 sites disposed to north and east of London, mainly equipped with static 3.7 and 4.5-inch guns. Its sites were in the process of being increased from four to eight guns each. Outbreak of war When the UK declared war on 3 September 1939, 26 AA Bde had the following composition:Routledge, Table LX, p. 378. * Brigade HQ: Brompton Road, Chelsea * 53rd (City of London) AA Regiment (went to France with the Advanced Air Striking Force October 1939)Farndale, p. 19. ** HQ, 157th, 158th, 159th (Lloyd's) City of London AA Batteries as before * 86th (Honourable Artillery Company) AA Regiment (a new unit formed in 1939 by the Honourable Artillery Company of London) ** HQ, 273rd, 274th, 275th AA Batteries all at Armoury House, Finsbury * 88th AA Regiment (a new unit formed in 1939 as a duplicate of 53rd HAA Rgt) ** HQ, 281st, 282nd, 283rd AA Batteries all at White City * 26th AA Brigade Company, Royal Army Service Corps During 1940 the AA Regiments of the RA were redesignated Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) regiments to distinguish them from the newer Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) regiments. Battle of Britain While the Luftwaffe attacked RAF airfields in south east England during the Battle of Britain, 26 AA Bde was hardly involved, but on 2 September 1940 a raid up the Thames Estuary reached the edge of the London IAZ and was engaged by guns of the brigade. Between 11 and 15 September, massed raids approached London, but running battles with RAF fighters broke up most of the raids before they reached the IAZ.Routledge, pp. 383–5. 221 HAA Battery of 91st HAA Rgt under 39 AA Bde in the Humber Gun Zone had been nominated as a reserve battery with mobile guns. As the London Blitz got under way during September it arrived to reinforce 26 AA Bde (one gunner was killed by a bomb blast). In mid-October, half of 286/91 HAA Bty arrived in London to reinforce 221 Bty. 221 Battery moved from London to Norwich later in October.91 HAA Rgt War Diary 1939–41, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/2382.39 AA Bde War Diary 1939–41,TNA file WO 166/2272.Operation Orders in 91 HAA Rgt War Diary January–May 1942, TNA file WO 166/7462.

A Parachute mine fell on one HAA position of 26 AA Bde in central London, killing three men and wounding 15, yet the position remained in action.Routledge, p. 395. The Blitz effectively ended in May 1941, but the organisation of AA Command continued to evolve. From September 1940, rocket projectors (Z Batteries) were introduced, equipped with rocket projectiles, and during 1941 increasing numbers of women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) took over roles in AA Command. Where they were integrated into units these were designated 'Mixed' ('M').Routledge, pp. 377, 399–400.

By October 1944, the brigade's HQ establishment was 9 officers, 8 male other ranks and 23 members of the ATS, together with a small number of attached drivers, cooks and mess orderlies (male and female). In addition, the brigade had a Mixed Signal Office Section of 1 officer, 5 male other ranks and 19 ATS, which was formally part of the Group signal unit.AA Command Organisation Table, October–November 1944, TNA file WO 212/148. Operation Diver A V-1 and launching ramp section on display at the Imperial War Museum Duxford The Luftwaffe began a new bombing campaign against London in early 1944 (the Baby Blitz). By now the night fighter defences and the London IAZ were well organised and the attackers suffered heavy losses for relatively small results. More significant were the V-1 flying bombs, codenamed 'Divers', which began to be launched against London from Northern France soon after D-Day. V-1s (known to Londoners as 'Doodlebugs') presented AA Command's biggest challenge since the Blitz. Defences had been planned against this new form of attack (Operation Diver), but it presented a severe problem for AA guns, and after two weeks' experience AA Command carried out a major reorganisation, stripping guns from the London IAZ and other parts of the UK and repositioning them along the South Coast to target V-1s coming in over the English Channel, where a 'downed' V-1 would cause no damage. As the launching sites were overrun by 21st Army Group, the Luftwaffe switched to air-launching V-1s over the North Sea, so 1 AA Group had to redeploy again to the east of London.Routledge pp. 408–21. Once 21st Army Group had captured Brussels and Antwerp, these cities became targets for V-1s launched from within Germany, and anti-Diver defences had to be established. 132nd and 137th (M) HAA Regiments from 26th AA Bde were among the reinforcements sent to Brussels in January 1945 for this duty.Routledge, p. 338. Postwar After VE-day, demobilisation of AA units began promptly. 132nd and 137th (M) HAA regiments were disbanded in Europe (in May and October 1945 respectively)Routledge, Table LVII, p. 366. and did not return to 26th AA Bde. By November 1945 the brigade had the following composition:Order of Battle of AA Command, 17 November 1945, TNA file WO 212/86. * 12th HAA Regiment ** 4, 18, 360 Btys * 153rd (M) HAA Regiment (dropped the (M) designation August 1945) ** 509, 513, 521 Btys * 156th (M) HAA ** 530, 532, 533 Btys * 162nd (M) HAA Regiment (dropped the (M) designation March 1946) ** 449, 480, 528 Btys All these regiments were disbanded in January 1947 except 12th HAA Rgt which was retained in the postwar Regular Army.68th to 75th Regts RA, from British Army 1945 on. Brigade HQ moved to Whetstone on 11 April 1946. When the TA was reformed on 1 January 1947, the brigade's Regular Army units reformed 6 AA Bde at Grays, Essex, while the TA portion was renumbered as 52 (London) AA Brigade, based at Chingford, Essex, in 1 AA Group. (The wartime 52 AA Bde in Scotland was renumbered as 78 AA Bde in the 1947 reorganisation.) 52 (London) Brigade had the following organisation:AA Brigades 30–66 at British Army units 1945 on * 459 (The Essex Regiment) (Mixed) HAA Regiment * 482 (Mixed) HAA Regiment (Essex) * 599 (Mobile) HAA Regiment (Essex Regiment) * 609 (Mixed) HAA Regiment (Tottenham) * 512 (Finsbury Rifles) LAA Regiment * 568 (St Pancras) Searchlight Regiment However, the brigade was disbanded in September 1948.

He owned Eclipse, the pre-eminent sire of the breed and ancestor of 95% of modern thoroughbreds, and from him bred horses including the Derby winners, Young Eclipse and Serjeant. Early years Born to an impoverished Irish smallholder in 1725, O'Kelly moved to London as a young man, where he worked as a sedan chair carrier. There he is reputed to have duped a wealthy heiress into marrying him, and absconded with her inheritance of £1,000; elsewhere this tale is dismissed as hearsay and the source of his initial wealth attributed to gambling. Either way, his money was soon frittered away on drink and gambling. This led in 1756 to a stay in the Fleet debtors' prison, where he met prostitute Charlotte Hayes. O'Kelly and Hayes formed a business, if not romantic, partnership which persisted for the rest of their lives. Both were freed in 1760 as part of George III's amnesty for those in debtor's jails. O'Kelly plied his trade as a conman in London's coffee-houses and, through his gambling contacts, introduced clients to Hayes. It is reported that O'Kelly himself took in female clients. Within eight years, they had amassed a total of £40,000, enough to branch out into racehorse ownership. They also came to own a significant property portfolio, including Clay Hill estate outside of Epsom, Cannons Park, a substantial villa built by William Hallett Esq, and former estate of the Duke of Chandos in Stanmore, Middlesex also property in Piccadilly and Half Moon Street in London O'Kelly began to learn about horse racing and breeding from some of the visitors to Hayes' establishment. It was here, from one of Hayes' clients, that he heard about a stallion bred by the late Duke of Cumberland, named Eclipse, of whom he purchased a 1/8th share. Eclipse Eclipse At New Market With Groom by George Stubbs (1724 - 1806) In 1769, his first season as a racehorse, the five-year-old Eclipse had remained unbeaten in the nine races he contested. This inspired O'Kelly to buy the horse outright from his owner William Wildman for the sum of 1,100 guineas. In 1770, under O'Kelly's ownership, Eclipse remained unbeaten for another nine races and retired having won career prize money of £3,000. Eclipse then went to stud for a fee of 50 guineas, the highest stud fee in the country, where he sired 930 colts and fillies over 17 years. Amongst the best of them were Young Eclipse and Serjeant, who enhanced Eclipse's stud reputation by winning early renewals of the Derby under O'Kelly's ownership. O'Kelly had narrowly missed out on winning the very first Derby with another son of Eclipse, Boudrow. Success with horses brought O'Kelly wealth, but not social standing. The Jockey Club refused his membership, even after O'Kelly became a Captain and then Lieutenant-Colonel in the Middlesex Militia. Despite his social ascent, and obvious charisma, the evidence of his humble upbringing remained: Death O'Kelly died of gout in 1787. He died \\"at about his sixty-seventh year of age\\", which would cast doubt on the accuracy of his birth date. His will stated that all his racehorses should be sold off and that his brother Philip and nephew Andrew should forfeit £500 of their inheritance if they retained any involvement in racehorses.

Raised Russian Orthodox, Helene was received into the Catholic Church in France and later became an oblate, taking the name Sister Olga. American novelist Flannery O'Connor, who \\"used to go with her nephew\\", later described Iswolsky as, \\"a Catholic of the Eastern Rite persuasion and sort of one-man Catholic ecumenical movement.\\"The Habit of Being: The Letters of Flannery O'Connor, page 97. Biography Hélène Iswolsky was born in 1896 in the family of Alexander Izvolsky, a Russian diplomat of the Russian imperial government in different countries of Europe and Japan from 1894 to 1910, then as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and from 1910 to 1917 as Ambassador to France. Hélenè was the niece of the Procurator of the Holy Synod, Peter Izvolsky. When the First World War started, Hélenè Isvolsky was in Berlin traveling from Russia back to her family in France, where during the war she took care of the wounded. She earned a living by working in French magazines, translating from Russian to French and English, and from French to Russian (among others, the philosophical works of Nicholas Berdyaev). In 1923 Isvolsky converted from Orthodoxy to Eastern Rite Catholicism. The rite of joining the Catholic Church was in a Benedictine monastery, where she met Russian-born nuns Paula and Eustochia Komarov (mother and daughter). In 1931 Isvolskaya went to Nagasaki (Japan), where she got married and became Baroness R. Ungern-Sternberg, but the marriage was unhappy and in 1932 she returned to Paris and since then used her original name only. In 1941 Isvolsky moved from France to the United States. She stopped in New York City, where the first time received support from the Tolstoy Foundation. Here she met with Irma Manziarli, a man of unusual fate. Irma was born in Saint Petersburg, her parents were German Protestants. She married an Italian and lived in France, then some time in India, in the Himalayas, where she studied Eastern religions. During meetings at the home of Manziarli had the idea of publishing an ecumenical magazine. Among the founders of the magazine were so different and people like Vasily Janowski, writer and doctor, Arthur Lourie, composer and converted to Catholicism, and Alexander Kazembek, party leader of the Mladorossi. The magazine title - \\"The Third Hour\\" - was taken from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 2. 4-17). The first issue was published in 1946 in three versions: English, Russian, and French. There were published ten issues, the last one came out in 1976, after the Izvolskaya's death, and it was dedicated to her. The purpose of the magazine was to unite all Christians - Catholics, Orthodox, and Protestants. The magazine published the work of authors such as Simone Weil, Edith Stein, Mother Maria Skobtsova, Teilhard de Chardin. It was attended by eminent scholars Jacques Maritain, Karl Barth, and Jean Daniélou. When it became possible, Elena visited Russia. Initially, with Dorothy Day she traveled by train from Moscow to Vladivostok. Then, in 1961 made the journey by car along the route Leningrad - Novgorod - Moscow - Vladimir - Tula - Eagle -Kharkiv - Poltava - Kiev. In Moscow, she visited the tomb of Vladimir Solovyov, where have some land (in December 1975 in Tivoli, New York, the land has been put in her grave. In the United States Elena joined the social movement Catholic Worker. In her 60s Izvolskaya lived at times in Tivoli that housed the village community movement. Not far from the Tivoli was a small Benedictine monastery, and Elena began to take an active part in the spiritual life of the monastery. In 1972, the monastery was moved to Cold Spring, near Tivoli. In the summer of 1974 she finally moved from New York to Cold Spring, to be closer to the monastery. The brothers helped her carry things, a library, an extensive archive. Elena Izvolskaya died in 1975, on Christmas Eve, in a hospital near Cold Spring. Shortly before her death, she became an oblate of the Benedictine monastery of Regina Laudis with the name Olga.

It served coastal and siege guns in World War I and World War II, and also served in the infantry role. Artillery Volunteers 1859-1908 The first artillery unit formed amid the enthusiasm that created the British Volunteer Force in the mid-19th Century was the 1st Northumberland Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVC), which was raised after a public meeting at Tynemouth on 7 May 1859. The meeting was held in response to statements by Commander Bedford Pim, Royal Navy, that a modern ironclad warship could do untold damage to the towns of Tyneside due to the poor state of their defences. The unit was raised by Edward Potter of Cramlington, a local coal mining engineer.Beckett, p. 63.Potter memorial at Cramlington.Potter family at Grace's Guides. By 25 May 1859, the first drill was held for Rifle and Artillery volunteers at Tynemouth, formal enrolment for the 1st Northumberland Artillery Volunteers opened on 2 August, and the corps was formally accepted on 16 August 1859. In November 1859, the new unit held its first gun practice, on two 70-year-old muzzle-loading smoothbore cannon at Tynemouth Castle.Beckett, Appendix VIII.Frederick, p. 667.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 138–43. A 2nd Northumberland AVC was formed at Tynemouth on 12 January 1860 but in May 1860 it was absorbed into the 1st as its second battery; four other batteries were raised at Willington Quay, Newcastle upon Tyne and North Shields. Other AVCs were also being formed in the area: the Percy Artillery, raised from tenants of the Duke of Northumberland and named after a previous volunteer unit of 1805,Percy Artillery at Amble & District Local History. was formed as the 3rd Northumberland AVC on 22 March 1860, then took the vacated position as 2nd. A new 3rd Northumberland AVC of two batteries was formed at Blyth on 23 November 1860, but was disbanded in January 1864. In September that year the Newcastle members of the Tynemouth Volunteers left to form a separate 2nd Newcastle AVC and in January 1865 the Willington Quay men became the 3rd Northumberland AVC. The 1st Administrative Brigade of Northumberland Artillery Volunteers was formed at Tynemouth on 4 April 1866 and included the 1st Northumberland (Tyneside Volunteers) and both its offshoots, the 2nd Newcastle and the 3rd Northumberland. (The 1st Newcastle and 2nd Northumberland (Percy Artillery) AVCs remained independent.) The 2nd Newcastle was absorbed into the 3rd Northumberland in 1868, in which year the brigade's HQ moved from Tynemouth to Newcastle. The 1st Durham AVC was added to the Admin Brigade in 1873.Army List, various dates. The Volunteers were consolidated into larger units in 1880, and the Administrative Brigade became the 1st Northumberland and Durham Artillery Volunteers on 23 July with its HQ at Newcastle: * Nos 1–6 Companies from 1st Northumberland AVC (Tynemouth) * Nos 7–12 Companies from 3rd Northumberland AVC (Newcastle) * Nos 13–15 Companies from 1st Durham AVC (Sunderland) However, the Tynemouth Volunteers were withdrawn to become independent again in April 1884. They were supposed to become the new 3rd Northumberland, but objected to the title, asserting their primacy, and in August were renamed The Tynemouth Artillery Volunteers (with emphasis on the definite article 'The'). The unit became part of the RA's Northern Division on 1 April 1882, then the Western Division on 1 July 1889. By now the unit had eight batteries. In the early years, the volunteer gunners practised on whatever guns were available, including those at Tynemouth Castle. But in addition to manning fixed coast defence artillery, some of the early Artillery Volunteers manned semi-mobile 'position batteries' of smooth-bore field guns pulled by agricultural horses. The Tynemouth Artillery Volunteers were supplied with light 9-pounder field guns in 1869. But the War Office refused to pay for the upkeep of field guns for Volunteers and they had largely died in the 1870s. In 1888 the 'position artillery' concept was revived and some Volunteer companies were reorganised as position batteries to work alongside the Volunteer infantry brigades. The Tynemouth Volunteer Artillery were re-equipped with 20-pounder field and 40-pounder fort guns in 1889 and on 14 July 1892 they were reorganised as a position battery and six companies:Beckett, p. 178.Litchfield & Westlake, p. 6. 40-pounder gun being fired. * HQ at Tynemouth * No 1 Battery at Tynemouth * Nos 2–4 Companies at Tynemouth * No 5 Company at Backworth * No 6 Company at Blyth and Ashington * No 7 Company at Blyth In 1893, the batteries at Tynemouth Castle were equipped with modern 6-inch breechloading guns on hydro-pneumatic disappearing carriages, and the Tynemouth Volunteer Artillery immediately began training to operate them. This was reflected in the War Office Mobilisation Scheme for that year, which allocated the unit to the Tynemouth fixed defences.Mobilization Tables for Home Defence, List of Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteer Units, HMSO, London, 1893 On 1 June 1899 the RA was split into Royal Field Artillery and Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA), which was responsible for all coastal and fortress artillery; the Volunteers were affiliated to the RGA. On 1 January 1902 the RA abandoned its divisional organisation and the unit changed its designation to Tynemouth Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers). Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the Tynemouth RGA was intended to combine with the 1st Durham RGA to form a Northumberland and Durham RGA (and spin off a battery and ammunition column for the local RFA brigade). These plans were radically changed, so that by 1910 the Tynemouth and 1st Durham elements had formed their own units.London Gazette, 20 March 1908London Gazette 14 October 1910 The Tynemouth RGA (TF) was designated as a Defended Ports unit with the following organisation:Conrad, 1914.Northumberland at Great War Centenary Drill Halls.RA Depots and Home Training Units at Long, Long Trail.Rinaldi, Richard A, 2008.

World War I Coast defence On the outbreak of war, the Tynemouth Volunteer Artillery deployed to its war stations in the Tyne Garrison. Shortly after the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service, and they began forming Second Line units (distinguished from the original First line by a '2/' prefix).Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. By October 1914, the campaign on the Western Front was bogging down into Trench warfare and there was an urgent need for batteries of siege artillery to be sent to France. The War Office decided that the TF units were well enough trained to take over many of the duties in the coastal defences, releasing Regular RGA gunners for service in the field.WO Instruction No 248 of October 1914. Soon the TF RGA companies that had volunteered for overseas service were also supplying trained gunners to RGA units serving overseas and providing cadres to form new units, although complete defended port units never went overseas. Thus the siege batteries formed in late 1915–early 1916 were a mixture of Regular and TF gunners from the RGA coast establishments together with new recruits.Sir John Eldridge's account in MacDonald, Pro Patria, p. 162. 44th Siege Battery formed at Sheerness in 1915 had its cadre provided by the Tynemouth RGA, while a number of others formed at Tynemouth (14 batteries in 1916 alone) may have included men from the Tynemouth RGA among the Regulars and recruits, although the War Office or Army Council Instructions did not specifically order this.Army Council Instructions, 1915–1916. Under Army Council Instruction 686 of April 1917, the coastal defence companies of the RGA (TF) were reorganised. The four serving companies of the Tynemouth RGA (1/1st, 1/2nd/ 1/3rd and 1/4th) were reduced to three (1st, 2nd and 3rd) albeit with a slightly larger establishment of five officers and 100 men, and were to be kept up to strength with Regular recruits.Frederick, p. 698.Army Council Instructions April 1917. By early 1918 the companies were serving in No 18 Coastal Fire Command based at Tynemouth. In April 1918 the following guns were in place around the Tyne:Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, Annexes 4 & 7.

It went out to the Western Front on 24 January 1916, manning two 12-inch railway howitzers and was involved in the preparatory bombardment for the Battle of the Somme later that year.Siege Batteries of the RGA at Long, Long Trail.'Allocation of Siege Batteries RGA', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/4.'44 Siege Battery War Diary January 1916–February 1918', TNA file WO 95/545.]Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, p. 346.Farndale, Western Front, p. 146. The battery remained in action throughout the Somme fighting of 1916. Thereafter the heavy howitzers were in great demand it was frequently shifted around the railway network behind the Western Front from one army to another. It ended the war attached to Fifth Army supporting the great Allied Hundred Days Offensive.Farndale, Western Front, Annex M. 44th Siege Battery continued in the Regular Army after the Armistice, becoming 16th Medium Battery in 4th Medium Brigade, RGA, in 1920.Frederick, p. 727. Interwar years Tynemouth Heavy Brigade The Tynemouth RGA reformed on 7 February 1920 and when the TF was reconstituted as the Territorial Army (TA) the following year, it was redesignated as the Tynemouth Coast Brigade, becoming the Tynemouth Heavy Brigade in 1924 when the RGA was subsumed into the RA. It had the following organisation:Frederick, p. 616. * Headquarters moved to Blyth in 1934 * 150 Heavy Battery at North Shields – from Nos 1 and 2 Companies * 151 Heavy Battery at Blyth – from No 4 Company * 152 Heavy Battery at Seaton Delaval – from No 3 Company 64th (Northumbrian) Anti-Aircraft Brigade On 1 October 1932, 152 Heavy Battery at Seaton Delaval left to be converted into 152 Medium Battery in 55th (Northumbrian) Medium Brigade. Then on 1 April 1934 150 Heavy Battery at North Shields also left to be converted into 150 Medium Battery in 51st (Midland) Medium Brigade. However, on 10 December 1936 these two batteries left their new brigades and were converted again into 179 and 180 (Tynemouth) Anti-Aircraft batteries forming a new 64th (Northumbrian) Anti-Aircraft Brigade based at North Shields. This unit could therefore be considered an indirect offshoot of the Tynemouth Volunteer Artillery. It saw service in World War II during the Battle of Britain and the Newcastle Blitz, North Africa, Italy, Yugoslavia and the occupation of Germany.Frederick, pp. 616, 733–4, 755, 771.Litchfield, pp. 192–4. World War II Mobilisation The TA was expanded in the years of tension leading up to World War II, and a new 152 Heavy Battery was formed in October 1937. In 1938 the TA replaced wits traditional unit designation of 'brigade' with 'regiment', and the unit was redesignated the Tynemouth Heavy Regiment on 1 October. Once war was declared, the regiment was split into three coast regiments.Named Heavy Regiments at RA 1939–45. The invasion threat after the Dunkirk evacuation and Fall of France led to a massive increase in Britain's coast defences. In addition to the existing fixed defences, a number of Coast Defence Emergency Batteries were established in May and June 1940, including:Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex B. * Seaham (Sunderland) – 2 x 6-inch Mk VII * Whitburn (Sunderland) – 2 x 6-inch Mk VII * Park (South Shields) – 2 x 6-inch Mk XII * Gloucester (Blyth) – 2 x 6-inch Mk XII * Frenchman's (South Shields) – 2 x 6-inch MkXII Park, Gloucester and Frenchman's batteries were initially established by the Royal Navy and transferred to the RA when sufficient coastal gunners had been trained. Coast Regiments The expansion of the RA's coast defence branch led to the Tynemouth Heavy Regiment being split into three coast regiments on 14 July 1940:Frederick, pp. 606–11, 624–5.

By then the threat from German attack had diminished and there was demand for trained gunners for the fighting fronts. A process of reducing the manpower in the coast defences began.Collier, Chapter XIX. 265/509 Coast Bty was placed in suspended animation on 20 June, just before 397 Bty arrived, and 261/508 Coast Bty was disbanded 10–17 October. 322/510 Coast Bty went to War Office Control on 7 May 1943, but was replaced by 444 Coast Bty, newly formed at Gloucester Battery. 420/508 Coast Bty was disbanded on 20 September 1943. IX Corps HQ left for North Africa (Operation Torch) and was replaced by Corps Coast Artillery HQ, Northumbrian District, by the end of 1942. The manpower requirements for the forthcoming Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord) led to further reductions in coast defences in April 1944.Collier, Chapter XXI. 509th Coast Rgt was placed in suspended animation on 1 April 1944 and its remaining batteries (264, 312, 314, 397) were regimented with 508th Coast Rgt. 70 Coast Observer Detachment was also disbanded in April 1944.Order of Battle of the Forces in the United Kingdom, Part 7, Coast Artillery and AA Defence of Merchant Ships, with amendments, 1 July 1943, TNA file WO 212/124. Late war As the campaign in North West Europe progressed after D Day, the manpower demands of 21st Army Group led to further reductions in coastal artillery. By this stage of the war many of the coast battery positions were manned by Home Guard detachments or in the hands of care and maintenance parties. On 18 October 1944, 510th Coast Rgt was placed in suspended animation and its units (264, 312, 314, 397 Coast Btys, 68 COD) were transferred to 508th Coast Rgt, and the positions manned by 259, 260, 262, 263 and 444 Coast Btys were placed under care and maintenance.Order of Battle of the Forces in the United Kingdom, Part 7, Coast Artillery and AA Defence of Merchant Ships (1 April 1944), with amendments, TNA file WO 212/120. =616 (Tynemouth) Regiment= Then, in January 1945, the War Office began to reorganise surplus anti-aircraft and coastal artillery regiments in the UK into infantry battalions, primarily for line of communication and occupation duties in North West Europe, thereby releasing trained infantry for frontline service.Ellis, pp. 369, 380. On 15 January 1945, all the remaining Tyne batteries were transferred to the command of 526th (Durham) Coast Rgt, while RHQ 508th Coast Rgt and Tynemouth Fire Control HQ were converted into 616 (Tynemouth) Regiment, RA.Frederick, p. 881.616 Rgt RA at RA 1939–45. After infantry training in Scotland with 301st Infantry Brigade, the brigade transferred to 21st Army Group on 9 May 1945, and landed on the Continent on 15 May (a week after VE Day), where it came under the command of First Canadian Army.Joslen, p. 397. The regiment was placed in suspended animation on 31 October 1945, completing the process on 24 November. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, 508 and 509 Coast Rgts were reformed as 404/405 (Tynemouth) Coast Regiment in 103 Coast Brigade, while 510 was formally disbanded. 404 and 405 Regiments, based at North Shields and Blyth respectively, had recruited sufficiently to become separate units by September 1948, with 405 Coast Rgt being converted into 405 (Tynemouth) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment that year. On 1 January 1954, 405 HAA Rgt absorbed 464 (Northumbrian) HAA Rgt (the successor of 64th (Northumbrian) HAA Rgt formed in 1936, see above) providing RHQ, P and Q Btys.Frederick, pp. 1005, 1010, 1013, 1016.Watson, TA 1947.372–413 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. When Anti-Aircraft Command was abolished and the number of AA units reduced on 10 March 1955, 405 (Tynemouth) HAA Rgt was amalgamated into 324 (Northumbrian) HAA Regiment (successor to the 1st Northumberland Artillery Volunteers from which the Tynemouth had separated in 1884 see above). The RA's Coast Artillery branch was also abolished the following year, and 404 (Tynemouth) Coast Rgt amalgamated into 439 Light AA Regiment (the old Tyne Electrical Engineers) at Tynemouth on 30 October 1956, forming P (Tynemouth) Battery. The regiment became 439 (Tyne) Light Air Defence Regiment in 1964.414–443 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. When the TA was reduced into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve in 1967, 439 (Tyne) LAD Rgt became the HQ Battery of the amalgamated 101 (Northumberland) Regiment RA (V), the battery regaining its subtitle 'Tynemouth Volunteer Artillery' in 1993. In July 2006, the battery was disbanded, but the name was perpetuated in the Radar (Tynemouth Volunteer Artillery) Troop, of 204 Battery, RA (V). Uniforms and insignia The original uniform of the Tynemouth Artillery Volunteers was the same as the Rifle Volunteers of the area: a silver-grey tunic with black braid and scarlet facings, grey trousers with black stripes, and black belts with bronze ornaments for other ranks, silver for officers wore. The headdress was a grey Shako with scarlet plume. The artillery wore a gun badge on the shako and pouch in place of the riflemen's bugle. This uniform only lasted a short while before Royal Artillery blue was adopted. When the Home Service helmet was adopted, the upper scroll on the helmet plate read 'THE TYNEMOUTH' and the lower read 'TYNEMOUTH ARTILLERY VOLUNTEERS' with the RA motto 'QUO FAS ET GLORIA DUCUNT' with the royal crown. The unit wore brass shoulder titles with the lettering in three tiers: 'THE/RA/TYNEMOUTH'. From 1952, 404 (Tynemouth) Coast Regiment wore the word 'TYNEMOUTH' inserted beneath the 'ROYAL ARTILLERY' on their red-on-blue shoulder badge.

This enzyme principally catalyses the following chemical reaction by cleaving pullulan's alpha-1,4-glucosidic bonds: : Hydrolysis of pullulan to panose (6-alpha-D-glucosylmaltose) The breakdown of the alpha-1,4- and alpha-1,6-glucosidic bonds of intermediates produced in addition to panose generates further quantities of panose along with some maltose and glucose.  Structure  Neopullulanase is a dimer of identical monomer subunits, each with four domains (N,A,B,C) that are highly conserved with other starch hydrolases, namely alpha-amylase, pullulanase, cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase, and 1,4-alpha-D-glucan branching enzyme (also known as glycogen branching enzyme). Like these enzymes, each monomer contains an active site at the carboxyl-terminus within a TIM barrel (also known as an alpha/beta barrel), an alpha/beta protein fold structure consisting of eight parallel beta-strands connected by eight external alpha-helices. This conserved structural domain is estimated to occur in roughly 10% of all proteins and may evolutionarily link neopullulanase and the similar starch hydrolases to a much larger family of enzymes, though the domain's common ancestry is debated due to a lack of conclusive sequence homology. In neopullulanase the barrel is located within domain A with its active site straddling domain A of one monomer with domain N of the other monomer. This results in narrower active site than the other alpha-amylase enzymes, which do not dimerize, and likely contributes to its ability of hydrolyzing both alpha-1,4- and alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages.  Mechanism  The hydrolysis of pullulan to panose is catalyzed by three amino acid residues within neopullulanase's active site that cleave a glycosidic bond: one glutamate and two aspartates. A glycosidic oxygen is first protonated by the carboxyl group of a glutamate residue (TAA Glu-230) through generic acid catalysis. The C1 carbon of pullulan is then attacked by a nucleophilic aspartate residue (TAA Asp-206). The carboxylate group of a second aspartate residue (TAA Asp-297) deprotonates an adjacent water molecule to form a hydroxide ion which hydroxylates at the C1 carbon. Alternatively it is possible that this reaction is concerted with the departed glycosidic oxygen being protonated to cause the hydroxylation. Mechanism of neopullulanase catalyzing hydrolysis of pullulan decomposition intermediate into panose and maltose. The three residues responsible for neopullulanase catalysis are invariably present in enzymes of the alpha-amylase family. Mutation of these residues in neopullulanase results in a complete loss of enzymatic activity. While most alpha-amylase enzymes only cleave alpha-1,4-linkages in their substrates, neopullulanase additionally cleaves alpha-1,6-linkages. In addition to the narrowness of the actives site resulting from the enzyme's dimeric structure, this additional functionality is thought to be facilitated by two histidine residues (TAA His-122 and TAA His-296) that interact with the glycan bond to be cleaved. As these histidines are present in the other alpha-amylase enzymes it is thought the functional difference arises from a difference in transition state stabilization energy contributions from the side chains of adjacent residues which vary from enzyme to enzyme. This allows for neopullulanase's multistep breakdown of pullulan. The enzyme first selectively hydrolyzes alpha-1,4-glucosidic bonds on the nonreducing side of pullulan's alpha-1,6-glucosidic bonds, producing panose and panose-containing intermediates. These intermediates then have their alpha-1,4- and alpha-1,6-glucosidic bonds hydrolyzed to form additional panose along with smaller quantities of maltose and glucose.  Biological Function  Pullulan, which is produced from starch, is a polysaccharide polymer consisting of repeating maltotriose units. It provides a protective effect against cellular desiccation in low-moisture environments. The presence of neopullulanase allows cells to recycle unneeded or excess pullulan by breaking it down into panose, maltose, and glucose which can then be formed back into starch or consumed for energy production.  Industrial Relevance  While not currently employed in any industrial processes, a method of producing isomaltooligosaccharide syrup using Bacillus stearothermophilus neopullulase has been proposed, taking advantage of neopullulase's ability to catalyze hydrolyisis of branched oligosaccharides' alpha-1-6-glucosidic linkages. While primarily used as a source for dietary fiber, isomaltooligosaccharide syrup is also used as a low-calorie sweetener that can reduce the buildup of dental plaque when present in place of sucrose. This process is simpler than the currently prevalent industrial process which relies upon multiple steps featuring four enzymes (alpha-amylase, pullulanase, beta-amylase, and alpha-D- glucosidase) and only achieves a 40% yield of isomaltooligosaccharides from starch. When immobilized neopullulanase is immersed in a buffered starch solution and incubated, a solution of isomaltooligosaccharides results at slightly over 40% yield. To further raise the yield to approximately 60%, which is thought to be so low since neopullulanase hydrolyzes starch less efficiently than pullunan and other oligosaccharides, saccharifying alpha- amylase sourced from Bacillus subtilis may be added to the solution.

There are more recent alluvial deposits with coral on the coast, as well as Cenozoic sedimentary. Amba Aradam Sandstones from the Jurassic Period are found in the southeast of the country.  Geologic overview  Lake Assal, created by rift generated fragmented relief. The country was formed by the collision of general tectonic trends of the East African Rift. The rift generated fragmented relief made up of high blocks and subsidence zones, which create geological features such as Lake Assal.  Tectonics  The Red Sea Gulf of the Aden split open during the Pliocene and early Pleistocene epochs. During these epochs, the Danakil Horst experienced an uplift of its southern prolongation. Analysis of plate tectonics at the triple junction region shows extension rates between 1 mm and 3 mm annually. Earthquake epicenters are focused along the peripheral block faults where the Ethiopian rift touches the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.  Geosites  A detailed investigation into the geosites available in Djibouti has not been performed yet, however the triple junction located at the East African Rift System is considered to be of significant geological interest.  Geohazards  Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur at the triple junction at the East African Rift System.  Economic impact  Although Djibouti produces minerals, it is an insignificant portion of its economy. Salt, available due to solar evaporation, is harvested at Lake Assal and helps to make the country Africa’s tenth largest salt producer. Limestone and calcined lime are also currently mined in Djibouti. Additional mining candidates include marble, granite, gypsum, diatomite and perlite. Petroleum could be extracted in the future; currently exploratory work is being performed. In addition to mining, the possibility of using geothermal energy is currently being investigated.

After defending the UK during the Battle of Britain and the Blitz early in World War II, it went on to see service in North Africa, Italy, Yugoslavia and Germany. It continued in the postwar TA until it was amalgamated in 1954. Origins As Britain expanded its anti-aircraft (AA) defences in the 1930s, one of the new units created was 64th (Northumbrian) AA Brigade of the Royal Artillery. Formed on 10 December 1936 and based at North Shields on Tyneside, it brought together two existing medium batteries (both had originally been heavy batteries of the Tynemouth Heavy Brigade):Litchfield, pp. 192–3.Frederick, pp. 755, 771.Monthly Army List, various dates.Frederick, p. 616. * 179 (Tynemouth) AA Battery at North Shields – converted from 150 Medium Battery of 51st (Midland) Medium Brigade * 180 (Tynemouth) AA Battery at Seaton Delaval – converted from 152 Medium Battery of 55th (Northumbrian) Medium Brigade The regiment formed part of 30th (Northumbrian) AA Group in 2nd AA Division. In March 1938 two AA batteries at Middlesbrough on Teesside were also regimented with the 64th (Northumbrian): * 174 (1st North Riding) AA Battery – transferred from 62nd (Northumbrian) AA Brigade * 175 (2nd North Riding) AA Battery – transferred from 62nd (Northumbrian) AA Brigade However, on 1 November 1938, 174 and 175 batteries left to form a new 85th (Tees) AA Brigade, and were replaced in 64th (Northumbrian) by a newly-formed 268 (Durham) AA Bty at Consett in County Durham.Frederick, pp. 576, 776.64 HAA Rgt at RA 1939–45. On 1 January 1939 the RA replaced its traditional unit designation 'Brigade' by the modern 'Regiment', which allowed the 'AA Groups' to take the more usual formation title of 'Brigades'. World War II Mobilisation and Phoney War 3.7-inch HAA gun preserved at Imperial War Museum Duxford. The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62–3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65–6, 371. As war broke out, 30th AA Brigade on Tyneside was transferring to 7th Anti-Aircraft Division, which was being formed to cover North East England. In September 1939 the Tyne Gun Defence Area (GDA) only had 34 3-inch or 3.7-inch guns in the Heavy AA (HAA) role. Luckily, the months of the Phoney War that followed mobilisation allowed AA Command to address its equipment shortages.Routledge, p. 373; Table LVIII, p. 376; Table LIX, p. 377.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. 64th (Northumbrian), in common with other AA units manning 3-inch guns or larger was redesignated HAA on 1 June 1940 to distinguish them from the new Light AA (LAA) units entering the order of battle. Battle of Britain Tyneside, Wearside, and Teesside were important strategic targets because of their high concentrations of heavy industry and ports. During the early part of the Battle of Britain, German day and night air raids and mine laying began along the East Coast of England, intensifying throughout June 1940. Thereafter the Luftwaffe concentrated on Royal Air Force (RAF) sites in the South of England, with occasional raids on the North East, such as the period 12–15 August.Routledge, Table LXII, pp. 379–80. On 15 August, in the belief that the defences of NE England had been denuded, Luftflotte 5 attacked across the North Sea from bases in Occupied Norway. Some 65 Heinkel He 111 bombers of Kampfgeschwader 26 escorted by 35 Messerschmitt Bf 110 Zerstörer fighters of Zerstörergeschwader 76 were picked up on radar and ambushed by fighters of No. 13 Group RAF before they reached the coast. Those bombers that succeeded in breaking through then split into two groups, one being engaged by the guns of the Tyne GDA the other by the Tees GDA. Bombs were widely scattered and only at Sunderland was any major damage inflicted. KG 26 lost 8 bombers and 7 fighters for no loss to the RAF, in 'one of the most successful air actions of the war'.Basil Collier pp. 191–4, Map 16.Richard Collier, Eagle Day, pp. 86–8. By 21 August, the Tyne GDA had 50 HAA guns in position.Basil Collier, Appendix XXII. Blitz The Battle of Britain was followed by the Luftwaffe 's night Blitz on London and other industrial cities during the winter of 1940–41. Again, NE England escaped the worst of this, but hundreds of people died during the Newcastle Blitz and there were other notable air raids on Tyneside on 9 April and Sunderland on 25 April.Basil Collier, Appendices XXX and XXXI.Routledge, pp. 387–404. AA Command was now reaching its peak strength: the regiment provided the cadre for a new 404 HAA Bty formed on 12 December 1940 at 211th HAA Training Rgt, Oswestry, which joined 123rd HAA Rgt. 427 HAA Battery, formed at 211th HAA Training Rgt on 24 April 1941 from a cadre supplied by 54th (City of London) HAA Rgt, then joined 64th (Northumbrian) on 22 July. Meanwhile the regiment had also supplied the cadre for 431 HAA Bty formed on 8 May 1941 at 210th HAA Training Rgt, Oswestry. This battery joined 64 HAA Rgt on 6 August to replace 427, which had been transferred on to 101st HAA Rgt.Frederick, p. 758.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/79. Mid-War The main Blitz ended in May 1941, but occasional raids continued. 64th HAA Regiment remained in 30 AA Bde for the rest of the year. As newly-formed units joined AA Command, experienced ones began to be posted away for service overseas. This accelerated in 1942 with the preparations for the Allied invasion of North Africa (Operation Torch).Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/80. On 12 January 1942, 431 HAA Bty transferred to 102nd HAA Rgt and was temporarily replaced by 414 HAA Bty from 123rd HAA Rgt. But 414 Bty moved within 30 AA Bde to 146th HAA Rgt on 1 February, leaving 64th HAA Rgt with just its three most experienced batteries: 179, 180 and 268; the war establishment for overseas service being a three-battery organisation. It left 30 AA Bde in April, and in June left AA Command altogether.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/81. The regiment now came under War Office control preparatory to going overseas.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 14 August 1942, TNA files WO 212/7 and WO 33/1927. As was normal practice, after training it was lent back to AA Command until it was required, coming first under 72 AA Bde, then from October under 5 AA Bde both in 2 AA Group, which was dealing with 'hit and run' raids by the Luftwaffe along the South Coast of England.Routledge, pp. 401–5.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, TNA file WO 212/82. North Africa 'Operation Torch' began in November 1942, but by February 1943 the regiment was still in the UK as part of GHQ Reserve with the following organisation as a mobile unit: Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 18 February 1943, TNA file WO 212/9. * 179, 180, 268 HAA Btys * 1504 HAA Rgt Platoon, Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) * 64 HAA Rgt Workshop Section, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) 64th HAA Regiment sailed in March 1943, and when the Tunisian Campaign ended with the fall of Tunis in May it was still en route to join 18th Army Group at Bougie.Routledge, Table XXXII, p. 190. In July 1943 it was with Allied Force Headquarters and was assigned to Eighth Army for the Allied invasion of mainland Italy in September.Joslen, pp. 465, 467. Italy The armies in Italy called in AA units progressively from North Africa as their defensive commitments grew. 64th (Northumbrian) HAA Rgt landed with 25 AA Bde in late December 1943. Two of its batteries (16 x 3.7-inch guns) were sent to Bari, where the air defences were being strengthened after the disastrous Air raid on Bari of 2 December, while 268 HAA Bty (8 x 3.7-inch) went to Barletta. Bari continued to attract Luftwaffe attention, particularly night raids accompanied by 'Window' to jam radar. The HAA batteries' GL Mk II gunlaying radar was least affected, and their sets were used to direct searchlights as well. 25 AA Brigade also set up a decoy site outside Bari and stationed some of its guns there to attract bombers away from the vital port.Routledge, pp. 290–1; Table XLIV, p. 295; Table XLVII, pp. 296–7. Yugoslavia 3.7-inch guns of 64th HAA Regiment on the island of Vis off the coast of Yugoslavia, August 1944. In March 1944 the British sent forces to garrison the island of Vis off the Croatian coast, which was the headquarters of the Yugoslav Partisans and the base for Royal Navy and Royal Marines raiding parties. AA defences were required for the airfield through which aid for the Partisans was channelled. 64th HAA Regiment was sent to provide the HAA component of this force, and it took over command of 24 x Bofors 40 mm guns of 31st LAA Rgt that were already deployed there. The Luftwaffe was weak in the Adriatic but by September both 64th HAA and 31st LAA had batteries in the Partisan front lines in Yugoslavia providing ground support fire. Molony, Vol VI, Pt I, pp. 391–2. Germany In early 1945 the deployment to Vis ended, 25 AA Bde was disbanded, and 64th HAA Rgt became non- operational. But unlike many other AA regiments in Italy that were being disbanded to provide infantry manpower, 64th HAA Rgt was transferred to the North West Europe theatre as a complete unit. By February 1945 it was serving in Second Army in its advance across Germany.Routledge, pp. 288–9.Joslen, p. 463.Ellis, Vol II, Appendix IV. In April 1945 it was under 31 AA Bde, which commanded the occupation troops and coast defences of the Friesland area. The AA gunners were by now operating as infantry.Routledge, Table LVII, p. 366. After VE Day, the regiment continued occupation duties in British Army of the Rhine until it was placed in suspended animation on 21 February 1946. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947 the regiment reformed at Whitley Bay as 464 (Northumbrian) HAA Regiment, forming part of 83 AA Bde. It became a 'Mixed' unit on 1 October 1948 when members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the regiment.Frederick, p. 1016.Routledge, Table LXXIV, p. 441.Watson, TA 1947.444–473 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. On 1 January 1954 it was amalgamated into 405 (Tynemouth) HAA Rgt, which also descended from the Tynemouth Heavy Bde that had originally supplied the regiment's first two batteries.Frederick, p. 1010.372–413 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.

Rösch was the first director of the Dotter Interventional Institute and served until 1995. He is credited with developing the TIPS procedure in 1969 and the incorporation of embolization into the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding in 1971. Dr. Rösch's work in the field of interventional radiology spans half a century and has resulted in over 470 scientific papers, multiple book chapters and dozens of scientific exhibits. Biography Early Life and Training Josef Rösch was born in Pilsen, Czechoslovakia in 1925. He credits his mother for inspiring him to help others and become a physician. Rösch attended medical school at Charles University in Prague and graduated in 1950. Initially, Rösch aspired to be an internist but decided to pursue radiology after working on splenoportography. After publishing a book on splenoportography, Rösch become friends with Charles Dotter. They would meet in 1963 at the Czechoslovak Radiologic Congress in Karlovy Vary, where Dotter gave his famous lecture on angiography, effectively creating the field of interventional radiology. Dotter recruited Rösch to do a one-year fellowship at Oregon Health and Science University. After the fellowship, Rösch spent two years at UCLA before returning to Oregon in 1970. Interventional Radiology Career While Josef Rösch helped advance many aspects of interventional radiology, his crowning achievements were the development of the TIPS procedure and the incorporation of embolization into the treatment of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The invention of the TIPS procedure, which creates a shunt between the portal and systemic venous circulation, revolutionized the treatment for portal hypertension. Similarly, arterial embolization for gastrointestinal bleeds became a powerful tool for life-threatening hemorrhages. Other techniques Rösch worked on include super-selective catheterization, expandable stents, thrombolysis and visceral angiography. Rösch would become the Chief of Vascular and Interventional Radiology at OHSU. During the late 1980s, his work helped found the Dotter Interventional Institute. Rösch retired from clinical practice in 1995 and has since served in a research faculty role at the Dotter Institute.  Awards  Some of Dr. Rösch's notable awards include: * SCVIR Gold Medal * Japanese Society of Angiography and Interventional Radiology Gold Medal * European Radiological Congress and Western Angiographic and Interventional Society Gold Medal * The Interventional Radiology Lifetime Achievement Award from Cardiovascular Interventional Radiology Society of Europe * 600 Year Anniversary Medal of Charles University in Prague * The AHA Scientific Council Distinguished Achievement and Distinguished Scientist Awards References Sources *Greene and Linton (2005).

There is a similarity with the NER Class C1, Caledonian Railway 294 and 711 Classes, Caledonian Railway 812 and 652 Classes, LB&SCR; C class, and SER O class. The wood-burning smoke stacks and wooden cab sides were installed for Finnish conditions. It should be remembered that the Grand Duchy of Finland was an autonomous part of the Russian Empire until 1917. Neilson also supplied a number of similar 5 foot gauge 0-6-0s to other railways in the Russian Empire, but few photographs and drawings remain. No 1427 at the Finnish Railway Museum is the only preserved example, and is therefore the only surviving example of the varied 0-6-0 types that were once common across the Russian Empire in the 19th Century. It therefore is one of the few clues as to the design of these Russian 0-6-0 locomotives that we now have. In fact, No.30 ended up remaining in Finland Station, St. Petersburg, Russia in 1918 during the civil wars in Finland and Russia. No 1427 is the second oldest locomotive in Finland after the 1868 Beyer Peacocks 0-4-2T. It is builder’s numbers 1427, a Finnish class C1 and carried running number 21. It was the first freight locomotive for Finnish Railways, then called SVR. In particular it was the first of a batch of 10 supplied (builder’s numbers 1427–1436 and running numbers 21–30) to the Riihimaki–St Petersburg Railway in 1869. They later also ran to Helsinki and Turku. The locomotive was withdrawn in 1926. The last of the class was withdrawn in 1929.

The largest city in each metropolitan or micropolitan statistical area is designated a \\"principal city.\\" Additional cities qualify if specified requirements are met concerning population size and employment. The title of each metropolitan or micropolitan statistical area consists of the names of up to three of its principal cities and the name of each state into which the metropolitan or micropolitan statistical area extends.http://proximityone.com/principalcities.htm In the United States and Puerto Rico, the Office of Management and Budget identifies principal cities for each Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) and New England City and Town Area (NECTA). Principal cities are used primarily for naming CBSAs and NECTAs, as well as combined statistical areas and combined NECTAs. Definition The largest incorporated place in a CBSA with a population of at least 10,000, or if no such incorporated place exists, the largest incorporated place or census-designated place in the CBSA is designated as the largest principal city. Additional principal cities can be included if they satisfy certain criteria depending on their population. These additional principal cities are: (a) incorporated or census-designated places that have a population of at least 250,000 in which the number of workers is 100,000 or more; (b) places with a population between 50,000 and 250,000 where the number of workers working in the place exceeds the number of working residents; and (c) places with a population between 10,000 and 50,000 where the number of workers working in the place exceeds the number of working residents and are at least one-third the population of the largest principal city. Principal cities encompass both incorporated places and census-designated places (CDPs). In addition to identifying the more significant places in each CBSA or NECTA in terms of population and employment, principal cities also are used in titling Metropolitan Divisions, Combined Statistical Areas, NECTA Divisions, and Combined NECTAs.

Further south the Tuareg Shield comprises the Hoggar, Adrar des Iforas and Air sub-shields which have each been affected by tectono-thermal events touching much of the continent. In the north are the Alpine chain mountains with a succession of folded and over-thrusted strata. Economic geology The production of oil and gas are important to Algeria's economy, being Africa's main producer of the latter. Its reserves were estimated at 4.502 trillion m3 at the end of 2008. Productive fields are found in anticlines, faulted anticlines or domes; the reservoirs being in Cambro-Ordovician, Triassic, Devonian, and Carboniferous sandstones. Caprocks include Triassic evaporites and Carboniferous to Devonian shales. The major source rocks for the hydrocarbons were Silurian shales rich in organic material. In 2008, Algeria was the fourth largest oil producer in Africa accounting for about one sixth of the continent's production. The country's proven reserves of crude petroleum are out at 1.66 billion tonnes, or about 1 percent of the global reserve.

It was released by Spinefarm Records on May 29, 2013 in Asia; June 3, 2013 in the United Kingdom; and June 25, 2013 in North America. Bú-Tik is the group's third record to be released through Spinefarm Records, and their second to have been produced and mixed by Rickard Bengtsson. Composition Speaking with Metalholic, bassist Doris Yeh compared the production of Bú-Tik to that of Takasago Army, stating, \\"The music production of Bú-Tik is very close to Takasago Army which we are quite satisfied with it. The structures of songs of Bú-Tik are a little bit different from Takasago Army. Songs of Bú-Tik are more fluent, smooth, and natural.\\" Commenting on the song writing process for Bú-Tik, vocalist Freddy Lim told Sonic Shocks, \\"I think the band especially the song writing process has become more natural, it’s much easier for me and Jesse to find the right balance for taking our souls and finding the right inspiration to music.\\" Promotion Along with a track-by-track review by Doris Yeh, the album's fourth track \\"Next Republic\\" was made available for streaming on April 22, 2013 through Terrorizer. A music video for the track \\"Defenders of Bú-Tik Palace\\" directed by Chuang Chi-wen and choreographed by Jeremy Yang was released on May 7, 2013. An additional music video directed by Lin Chun, for the track \\"Sail into the Sunset's Fire\\", was released on May 24, 2013. The video was filmed during a rain storm at an outdoors swimming pool. On June 4, 2013, a full-stream of the album was posted on SoundCloud by Spinefarm Records. On June 10, 2013, a third video directed by Cheng Wen-tang and Chang Yih-feng for the track \\"Supreme Pain for the Tyrant\\" debuted on Revolver. Album cover The album cover art was revealed on April 1, 2013. It was said by the band that the artwork was created to depict the theme of the album which was \\"the idea of an armed body and mind\\". The image is made of the features of an elder, child, and girl model. The female model depicted in the cover, Bu (小布), was chosen of nearly a hundred volunteer candidates. The album cover was designed by Oink Chen and with photography by 林峻. Reception Critical reception Bú-Tik has received mainly positive reviews from professional critics. Edward Banchs of About.com commented on the records distinctiveness, \\"Gravely overlooked, Chthonic have crafted a unique sound in an otherwise repetitive genre, with an identity that speaks to pride as much as it speaks to the thrash influenced aggression that band unleashes with each record, and Bu-Tik is no exception.\\" Ray Van Horn, Jr. of Blabbermouth.net gave the album a ten out of ten and likened it to their 2006 record Seediq Bale, stating \\"CHTHONIC has proven themselves true to their own cause and should anyone have been worried that [...] the corroding brutality of \\"Seedig Bale\\" [sic] has been relegated to the past, then \\"Bú-Tik\\" will dissolve those notions.\\" Awards For their work on Bú-Tik, the group won three awards during Taiwan's Golden Music Awards, including: \\"Best Album Award\\", \\"Best Band\\" and \\"Best Musician\\". The group was nominated for seven awards at the event. Track listing Bú-Tik album track listing adapted from Allmusic. Personnel Bú-Tik album personnel adapted from Allmusic.

Plot  Casper Galloway, an overcautious boy, has become afraid of anything dangerous since the day his father died in an accident at the Occult Barn, his grandfather Horus's shop. When Horus receives a lifetime achievement award, Casper mans the shop so Horus can collect the trophy. Horus warns \\"no one is to come within spitting distance\\" of an urn kept on a high shelf topped with a skull. Horus goes on to explain that Casper's great grandfather Gilbert Galloway imprisoned a malevolent spirit inside the urn and it will curse the person that lets it out. Charlotte, the girl Casper has a crush on, visits and he tries impressing her with a free purchase for loyal patronage to the Occult Barn. However, more of their friends arrive and make the situation worse. Casper takes down the urn to show off to Charlotte and clumsily drops it. Casper tries warning them of the danger, but they laugh at him, thinking him to be paranoid. Skeptical, they invent a curse of their own: anyone with whom they make eye contact with after 10pm (since midnight is cliche) will kill themselves and come back as a \\"zemon\\", a zombie possessed by the evil demonic spirit entrapped in the urn. The zemons spread their infection through hickeys rather than bites, and those infected kill themselves and become zemons. As an additional rule, if someone gives a zemon a French kiss, the zemon will become their slave. They are given until morning to undo the curse, or else they're cursed for eternity. However, they neglect to come up with an easier way to break the curse. When Casper spends the entire evening preparing for the curse, his concerned mother believes him to be on drugs. Once 10 o'clock comes, Casper decides the curse is fake, makes eye-contact with his mother, and explains something happened at the Occult Barn, ending her worries. At a football game, players and cheerleaders begin killing themselves, and Casper and his friends realize the curse they made up has come true. Casper finds his mother dropped a toaster into the bathtub with her, and he flees when she comes back a zemon. Luckily, she's hit by a car, but Casper accidentally makes eye-contact with a passenger, forcing him to run again. He bumps into his best friend Becky, whose boyfriend had turned into a zemon earlier that night, and she says she now believes that the curse is coming true and that Casper was right. The two of them realize that the others are still at the football game and rush to their rescue. Once they arrive, Casper and Becky see the field covered with the bodies of the game's attendees and their friends are the only ones standing. The zemons awaken shortly after and chase down the group. They track down Casper's friend Seth, another member of the gang, to warn him about the curse. Seth, who had ignored the curse, reveals to the others that he had made eye-contact with everyone he met that night, thus speeding things up. The zemons manage to catch up to the group and attempt to attack them in Seth's house, but Casper and his friends escape in Seth's Winnebago. Everyone plans to search the Occult Barn's books for the way to break the curse. Horus returns, horrified to learn of the idiocy that occurred in his absence. Before he can explain how to undo the curse, he succumbs to it and jams his trophy into his skull; however, he tells them they have to dig. They retrieve the items needed to seal the spirit again: the ashes from the previous urn (which Casper had stored in his backpack), a human skull (one of which, according to Dazzle, is in the anthropology classroom at their college), a heart (which they dissect from a toad), an urn (later replaced by one of Seth's mugs after Dazzle succumbs to the zemon curse and breaks it), and the watch belonging to Horus's father (which they have to get out of his grave). However, most of the group is killed by the zemons along the way, leaving only Casper and Charlotte. A final line in the instructions reveals that Casper must give his life to undo the curse. He sets off a grenade, ready to die, but instead time rewinds to the moment right before the urn broke; everyone retains memory of what happened, ensuring they don't cause another curse. When Casper and Charlotte graduate, they visit Horus and explain that they wish to become Occult Barn employees to pay for their new place. Overjoyed, Horus decides to take his first vacation ever; his attire suggests, he is going to Hawaii. After he leaves, the couple make out and accidentally knock down the urn.

Career  Le Même was born in Saint-Malo in the family of an accountant, and studied in order to enlist in the navy. At the age of 14, he enlisted as a volunteer on the merchantman Pouponne, which departed Saint-Malo in early 1778, bound for Northern America. After the outbreak of the War of American Independence, Le Même returned to Brest on the Gentille. Le Même enlisted on the privateer Prince-de-Montbarrey which, after taking a number of prizes, was herself captured by a frigate on 28 June 1779.Cunat, p.404 Exchanged the following year, Le Même served on the ships Lys, Pilote-des-Indes and Petite-Guêpe, which he learnt that the war had ended. Replacing the lieutenant of the ship Marie-Constance, Le Même sailed to Le Havre. Le Même then sailed on various merchantmen, rising to the rank of captain on 5 January 1790. He served as a lieutenant on the Mississippi, before taking command of the Liberté, bound for the Indies. He departed on 3 September 1791 and arrived at Mauritius before sailing to Pondicheri and Bengal, before returning to Port-Louis. Le Même then took command of the 130-ton brig Hirondelle, and cruised to Java and Sumatra, returning to Mauritius in March 1793. At the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, Le Même converted Hirondelle into a privateer, arming her with twelve 4-pounder guns and recruiting a 110-man crew.Cunat, p.405 He then departed to prey on Dutch commerce. On 16 August 1793, Hirondelle met the brig 18-gun Good- Werwgting, under Lieutenant Raken, and captured her by boarding. Le Même sent a prize crew under Lieutenant Legars on Good-Werwgting and continued his cruise. On 25 August, Hirondelle met the 40-gun East Indiaman Williams- Thesied, under Captain John Thomson; boarded at once by both Hirondelle and Good-Werwgting, Williams-Thesied surrendered after a 40-minute battle.Cunat, p.406 Hirondelle then returned to Port-Louis with her prizes. Le Même transferred on the 32-gun privateer Ville-de-Bordeaux, with a 200-man complement, keeping Legars as his lieutenant. He reached Padang in mid- December 1793, stormed the fortress, and captured the Dutch trading post, which he ransomed. He then sailed to Sunda Strait to patrol the area, but an epidemic aboard forced him to abbreviate his cruise and return to Mauritius. While in transit, on 12 February 1794, Ville-de-Bordeaux met the Portuguese Saint-SacrementName in Cunat, p.406, but evidently translated to French. sailing from Bengal to Lisbon, and captured her.Cunat, p.407 A few days later, a storm separated Ville-de-Bordeaux from her prize; Saint-Sacrement reached Mauritius on 25 February and Ville-de-Bordeaux, on the day after. Le Même was awarded 1 100 000 livres tournois in prize money. Le Même next captained the privateer Amphititrite,Cunat (p.407) refers to Amphitrite as a \\"frigate\\"; however, no frigate Amphitrite of the French Navy operated in the Indian Ocean circa 1794 (Roche, p.40). Cunant probably means that Amphitrite was a three- masted privateer of the approximate strength of a naval corvette, instead of the more usual brigs used by privateers. a prize taken by Sercey's squadron in the Indian Ocean and sold by the colonial government of Mauritius; Amphititrite was old and in poor condition, and after cruising off Cape of Good Hope without taking any prize, she sprang leaks and foundered in Bombetoka Bay, forcing her crew to return to Mauritius on small ships. Le Même then sailed on the privateer Uni before transferring on Clarisse, and retired. He started a career and a businessman, in which he lost his 1,400,000 livre tournois fortune. In 1803, with the outbreak of the War of the Third Coalition, Le Même took command of the 360-ton three-masted privateer Fortune; on 26 January 1804, Fortune fought an indecisive battle against the British frigate Bombay.Granier, p.445Possibly HCS Bombay After a six-month cruise, he returned to Mauritius with eight prizes.Cunat, p.408 On 20 August 1804, Fortune departed Mauritius to take station in the Persian Gulf area, where she captured the 16-gun East Indiaman brig Fly after a 30-minute battle. Fly carried 50,000 piastres for the British government. Fortune continued her patrol and captured a number of smaller prizes. Le Même then decided to cruise off Gujarat; on 7 November, around 10:00, Fortune met the frigate HMS Concorde, under Captain John Wood. Concorde had been dispatched specifically to hunt for Fortune, and even had a 60-man reinforcement to her crew for the battle.Cunat, p.409 Fortune attempted to flee and Concorde gave chase, resulting in a race that lasted for several hours before Concorde overhauled her opponent. Le Même resisted fiercely before striking his colours at 22:15. Captain Wood treated his prisoner with great courtesy and returned to Bombay; Fortune, in poor state after the battle, limped in several dayslater. Fate Le Même embarked on the East Indiaman Waltherstow, bound for England, which departed on 15 February 1805.

A LaserDisc player is a device designed to play video (analog) and audio (analog or digital) stored on LaserDisc. LaserDisc was the first optical disc format marketed to consumers; it was introduced by MCA DiscoVision in 1978. From 1978 until 1984, all LaserDisc player models read discs by using a helium–neon laser. In 1984, Pioneer Corporation introduced the first consumer player with a solid-state laser diode. This model, the Pioneer LD-700, was also the first LaserDisc player with a front-loading disc bay instead of a top-loading one. Pioneer became the market leader in LaserDisc technology. In the 1990s, Pioneer and others produced a small number of a high-definition video player models, which employed multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding (MUSE) technology. In 1996, Pioneer distributed their first DVD player in Japan, a combination Laserdisc/DVD player, model DVL-9. Pioneer announced the end of LaserDisc player production in January 2009. The last models Pioneer produced were the DVL-919 (an LD/DVD player), CLD-R5 (an LD/CD player), DVK-900 (an LD/DVD karaoke system), and DVL-K88 (an LD/DVD karaoke player). Laser technology Tube lasers The earliest players employed gas helium–neon laser tubes to read discs and had a red-orange light with a wavelength of 628 nm, while later solid-state players used infrared semiconductor laser diodes with a wavelength of 780 nm. Both the Magnavox Magnavision and the Pioneer LD players used the same model of laser tube. From 1978 to 1984, all LaserDisc players, either industrial or consumer, used helium-neon laser tubes. Solid-state lasers In March 1984, Pioneer introduced the first consumer player with a solid-state laser, the LD-700. It was also the first LD player to load from the front and not the top. One year earlier Hitachi introduced an expensive industrial player with a laser diode, but the player, which had poor picture quality due to an inadequate drop-out compensator, was made only in limited quantities. After Pioneer released the LD-700, gas lasers were no longer used in consumer players, despite their advantages, although Philips continued to use gas lasers in their industrial units until 1985. Helium-Neon gas lasers had a shorter-wavelength laser that created a much smaller spot on the disc, leading to better tracking of imperfectly manufactured discs, such as an off-center hole punch or slightly eccentric tracks. The use of a solid state laser diode necessitated the introduction of the tilt-servo mechanism in LD players; this physically tilted the entire laser table, keeping it parallel with the disc, thus ensuring the larger laser beam spot was always perfectly circular and helping to reduce or eliminate crosstalk on warped CLV discs. In addition, the gas laser was less sensitive to external vibration, a must in certain industrial environments, and generated less photon-shot noise than the solid-state laser diode, resulting in a cleaner, less \\"busy\\" on-screen image. =Picture quality= The picture produced by the LD-700's laser could be instantly recognized at the time; it was slightly softer, and large expanses of color in the image, such as a blue sky, would show streaking artifacts. Also, the infrared laser did not cope as well with disc manufacturing defects, such as dirt trapped under the surface of the disc (inclusions), an off-center hole or track errors created during mastering, such as track-to-track \\"kissing\\" (tracks touching). Because of this, collectors with large MCA DiscoVision collections (DiscoVision discs had just those type of above mentioned defects) tended to use tube-based LaserDisc players, since they played these discs better. In addition to being the first LaserDisc player to use a laser diode, the Pioneer LD-700 was also the first player ever to have the aforementioned \\"tilt\\" servo, which was arguably one of the greatest advances in LaserDisc players, providing superior tracking. Mechanisms for changing discs Most LaserDisc players required the user to manually turn the disc over to play the other side. A number of players (all diode laser based) were made that were capable of playing both sides of the disc automatically; at the end of the first side, or at the viewer's command, the machine would reverse the direction of the disc's rotation, simultaneously moving the laser pickup head to the other side of the disc, and then initiate playback. Since LDs are made up of two single sided discs glued together, the auto-reverse player would center each disc side individually. LaserDisc players used either a simple U-shaped reversing mechanism, known as \\"Epsilon Turn\\", or technique known as \\"Gamma Turn\\", where the player physically rotated the laser reading head ° as it moved from one side of the disc to the other, ensuring that the laser retained the same playback orientation on both sides of the disc. Some players even had twin laser reading circuits to eliminate excessive servos. Multi-disc players While Pioneer produced some industrial \\"jukeboxes\\" that held more than 50 discs, one company offered, for a short time in 1984, a \\"LaserStack\\" unit that required the user to physically remove the player lid for installation and attached to the top of the Pioneer LD-600, LD-1100 or the Sylvania/Magnavox clones. LaserStack held up to 10 discs and could automatically load or remove them from the player or change sides in around 15 seconds. A version for the Magnavox Magnavision and Pioneer VP-1000 was announced, as was a model for the front-loading players, but the company went out of business before the units were available. Only one consumer player, the LD-W1 (it was also released industrially too), was made that could hold more than a single disc; the W1 held two discs and could automatically change discs and sides by rotating the entire mechanism, including both the laser and turntable. Electrically, the LD-W1 was identical to the Elite LD-S1. The LD-W1 remained in the Pioneer catalog for many years and received many improvements: While the first version of the W1 had only 2X oversampling and 16-bit D/A converters in the digital audio, the later units had 4X oversampling with 20-bit D/A converters. The video noise reduction was improved, too, sharpening the picture and reducing disc noise while eliminating the artifacts it caused. In addition, high-frequency response in the FM video demodulator and A/D-D/A converters was extended and flattened, increasing resolution and reducing visible digital artifacts. The W1's player software was refined too, making disc and side-changing faster, plus, during side or disc changes, it grabbed a still-frame closer to the actual end-of-program instead of just any frame from the side's last five minutes. Industrial LaserDisc players The Pioneer PR7820 was the first mass-produced, industrial LaserDisc player, sold originally as the MCA DiscoVision PR-7820. This unit was used in many GM dealerships as a source of training videos and presentation of GM's new line of cars and trucks in the late 1970s and early 1980s. After MCA DiscoVision shut down, Pioneer continued to sell the player under the Pioneer name as the Pioneer Model-III. The unit was a full Level-III player and could accept a data-dump from discs themselves. It could also be controlled by an external computer and could be gen-locked to external video sources. The 7820 was the only player ever sold to either the industrial or consumer market that was entirely designed and engineered by the technicians at MCA Disco-Vision and contained all of their preferred design approaches, such as playing the disc with the laser on top (instead of underneath) and moving the disc radially to provide tracking instead of moving the laser radially. MCA engineers designed the player at the DiscoVision labs in Torrance, California and Universal- Pioneer mass-produced it in Japan. The 7820 was such a high quality player that MCA themselves used it at their DiscoVision disc pressing plant in Carson, California for quality control checks of both master discs and finished sets. Unfortunately, this caused problems because the 7820 could easily play discs that the poorly designed and quite primitive consumer player, the Magnavox VH-8000, simply could not cope with. In 1980, Discovision Associates released a factory update, which could also be retrofitted to existing 7820s, that reduced disc search times to less than three seconds, and added the ability to jump up to 99 tracks during vertical blanking, giving essentially \\"instant\\" searches. An external computer interface box was also made available at the same time which contained additional memory that increased the total size of a disc-based computer program the 7820 could store and execute to 256k. The 7820 was the first LD player to use solid-state tangential tracking: instead of a tangential tracking mirror, the 7820 used an electronic CCD delay line to provide tangential tracking corrections, giving the player superb color quality. It was not until 1985/6 that the tangential mirror began to be replaced by electronic correction, first by Yamaha in their first consumer LD player, and eventually, by Pioneer themselves. MCA DiscoVision had no suggested retail price for the PR-7820; depending on the number purchased, it varied from $3,500 to $2,200 per unit if more than 1000 were bought at once. Fully functional 7820s are not easily available on eBay and are nearly impossible to find in fully functional condition. Because they have a steel chassis, weight is a shipping problem. Multiformat players Most players made after the mid-1980s were capable of also playing audio CDs. These players included a indentation in the loading tray, where the CD would be placed for play. At least two Pioneer models (The CLD-M301 and the CLD-M90) also operated as a CD-changer, with several 4.7 in indentations around the circumference of the main tray. In 1996, the first model DVD/LD combi-player (and first Pioneer DVD player, for that matter) was the Pioneer DVL-9 released in Japan. The Pioneer Elite DVL-90, an updated version, followed by a similar, though supposedly lower-end model, the DVL-700, were released in 1997. Successors to this model include the Pioneer DVL-909, Pioneer DVL-919, and the Pioneer Elite DVL-91. Although the DVD/LD combi players offered competent LD performance, they paled in comparison to high-end LD players such as the Pioneer Elite CLD-99 and the Pioneer Hi-Vision/MUSE HLD-X9. The Pioneer DVL-909 lacks support for DTS output. However, a modification to the player can allow this player to support DTS streams on DTS discs, essentially turning the DVL-909 into a Pioneer Elite DVL-91. The last model DVD/LD player was the Japanese only DVL-H9, but the older DVL-919 is still sold in the U.S. and appears on Pioneer's North American website. However, it has not been actively marketed since the late 1990s. The DVL-919 supports DTS output. The DVL-919's DVD section is unremarkable by modern standards, and does not support progressive scan (480p) even though it has component output. As noted above, the LD section, while competent, is inferior to earlier high-end LD players. A few Pioneer dealers offered North American specification DVL-919s, and a unit purchased in April 2004 had a manufacture date of December 2003. Manufacturing of the DVL-919 continued until January 1, 2009, when Pioneer announced that production would cease after a final production run of 3000 DVL-919 and other model laser disc players. High-end consumer models Certain Japanese models of Pioneer players are considered by enthusiasts to be of higher quality or capable of higher-quality playback than North American models. These include the CLD-R7G, LD-S9, HLD-X9 and HLD-X0. The LD-S9 and HLD-X9 share a highly advanced comb filter, allowing them to offer a considerable advantage in picture quality over most other LD players when the S-Video connection is used. The comb filter present in these players is unique and is purportedly the finest comb filter ever used in consumer A/V gear: it is still in use in Mitsubishi's top-spec CRT rear-projection television sets (the Diamond and now defunct Platinum series sets) and Pioneer's Elite line of rear-projection televisions. In addition to the advanced comb filter, the HLD-X0 and HLD-X9 contains a red-laser pickup, which significantly reduces crosstalk and picture-noise levels compared to players with the traditional infrared laser; it can also read through all but the worst cases of laser rot and surface wear. The HLD-X0 and HLD-X9 were also MUSE players, capable when properly equipped of playing back high-definition video LaserDiscs, called Hi-Vision or MUSE discs in Japan. High-definition (MUSE) The HLD-1000 was Pioneer's first high-definition video player; it was one of a small number of models to employ multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding (MUSE) technology. It was followed by the HLD-X0, which by many enthusiasts is regarded as the best LaserDisc player ever made. The HLD-X0 was entirely hand-built and weighed . Although the X9 has auto-reverse, the X0 offers a picture with less noise and better color rendering than any other player.

OGA is encoded by the MGEA5 gene. This enzyme catalyses the removal of the O-GlcNAc post-translational modification in the following chemical reaction: # [protein]-3-O-(N-acetyl-β-D- glucosaminyl)-L-serine + H2O [protein]-L-serine + N-acetyl-D-glucosamine # [protein]-3-O-(N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminyl)-L-threonine + H2O [protein]-L-threonine + N-acetyl-D-glucosamine  Nomenclature  Other names include: * Nuclear cytoplasmic O-GlcNAcase and acetyltransferase Isoforms There are three isoforms of O-GlcNAcase in humans that have been identified. Full-length O-GlcNAcase (fOGA), the shortest O-GlcNAcase (sOGA), and a variant of OGA (vOGA). The human OGA gene is capable of producing two separate transcriptions, each capable of encoding a different OGA isoform. The long isoform gene codes for fOGA, a bifunctional enzyme that primarily resides in the cytoplasm. In contrast, vOGA resides within the nucleus. However, all three isoforms exhibit glycoside hydrolase activity. Homologs Protein O-GlcNAcases belong to glycoside hydrolase family 84 of the carbohydrate active enzyme classification. Homologs exist in other species as O-GlcNAcase is conserved in higher eukaryotic species. In a pairwise alignment, humans share 55% homology with Drosophilia and 43% with C. elegans. Drosophilia and C. elegans share 43% homology. Among mammals, the OGA sequence is even more highly conserved. The mouse and the human have 97.8% homology. However, OGA does not share significant homology with other proteins. However, short stretches of about 200 amino acids in OGA have homology with some proteins such as hyaluronidase, a putative acetyltransferase, eukaryotic translation elongation factor-1γ, and the 11-1 polypeptide. Reaction Protein O-GlcNAcylation Metabolic pathway for OGA O-GlcNAcylation is a form of glycosylation, the site-specific enzymatic addition of saccharides to proteins and lipids. This form of glycosylation is with O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine or β-O-linked 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glycopyranose (O-GlcNAc). In this form, a single sugar (β-N-acetylglucosamine) is added to serine and threonine residues of nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins. Two conserved enzymes control this glycosylation of serine and threonine: O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). While OGT catalyzes the addition of O-GlcNAc to serine and threonine, OGA catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of O-GlcNAc from post- transitionally modified proteins. OGA is a member of the family of hexosaminidases. However, unlike lysosomal hexosaminidases, OGA activity is the highest at neutral pH (approximately 7) and it localizes mainly to the cytosol. OGA and OGT are synthesized from two conserved genes (OGA is encoded by MGEA5) and are expressed throughout the human body with high levels in the brain and pancreas. The products of O-GlcNAc and the process itself plays a role in embryonic development, brain activity, hormone production, and a myriad of other activities. Over 600 proteins are targets for O-GlcNAcylation. While the functional effects of O-GlcNAc modification is not fully known, it is known that O-GlcNAc modification impacts many cellular activities such as lipid/carbohydrate metabolism and hexosamine biosynthesis. Modified proteins may modulate various downstream signaling pathways by influencing transcription and proteomic activities. Mechanism and Inhibition a. Inhibitors for OGA b. Cross section of active site OGA catalyzes O-GlcNAc hydrolysis via an oxazoline reaction intermediate. Stable compounds which mimic the reaction intermediate can act as selective enzyme inhibitors. Thiazoline derivatives of GlcNAc can be used as a reaction intermediate. An example of this includes Thiamet-G as shown on the right. A second form of inhibition can occur from the mimicry of the transition state. The GlcNAcstatin family of inhibitors exploit this mechanism in order to inhibit OGA activity. For both types of inhibitors, OGA can be selected apart from the generic lysosomal hexosaminidases by elongating the C2 substituent in their chemical structure. This takes advantage of a deep pocket in OGA's active site that allow it to bind analogs of GlcNAc. There is potential for regulation of O-GlcNAcase for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. When the tau protein in the brain is hyperphosphorylated, neurofibrillary tangles form, which are a pathological hallmark for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In order to treat this condition, OGA is targeted by inhibitors such as Thiamet-G in order to prevent O-GlcNAc from being removed from tau, which assists in preventing tau from becoming phosphorylated.  Structure  X-ray structures are available for a range of O-GlcNAcase proteins. The X-ray structure of human O-GlcNAcase in complex with Thiamet-G identified the structural basis of enzyme inhibition.

(ESB) was founded in 1953 as a charitable organisation by Christabel Burniston, a pioneer of a new approach to developing speech and listening skills. Breaking away from the traditional ‘elocution’ classes and exams of the era, ESB’s approach was to enable individuals to learn and be tested on their communication skills in a supportive group. The ESB method of assessment placed the candidate – rather than the examiner – as the authority in the examination. Other professional teaching organisations recognised the merits of this approach and were later to reflect these ideas – notably the 1963 Newsom Report Half Our Future. Education journalist Susan Elkin noted in The Stage's 2006 obituary of Christabel Burniston that the ESB had anticipated the GCSE and National Curriculum approach to speaking and listening by more than 40 years. In the 1960s, under Burniston’s stewardship, the organisation became known as ESB (International), extending its influence to other English-speaking countries, including Singapore, Kenya, Cyprus and Malta.

Roenneberg, in collaboration with Martha Merrow, explores the impact of light on human circadian rhythms, focusing on aspects such as chronotypes and social jet lag in relation to health benefits.  Life  Roenneberg was born in Munich, Germany. He began working with Jürgen Aschoff at the age of 17. Roenneberg attended both the University College London and Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich where he began by studying physics. He switched to medicine in order to focus on the science of the human body, but ended up studying biology. As a postdoctoral fellow, he studied again under Jürgen Aschoff, studying annual rhythms in the body, then moved to the United States to study the cellular basis of biological clocks under Woody Hastings at Harvard University. In 1991, he began the tradition of giving the Aschoff's Ruler prize to a chronobiologist who has advanced the field. He is currently the vice-chair of the Institute for Medical Psychology of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, the head of the Centre for Chronobiology, the president-elect of the European Biological Rhythms Society, the president of the World Federation of Societies for Chronobiology, and a member of the Senior Common Room of Brasenose College, University of Oxford. From 2005 to 2010 he was the coordinator of \\"EUCLOCK\\" and coordinator of the Daimler-Benz- Foundation network \\"ClockWORK\\", and from 2010 to 2012 was the member at large of the Society for Research of Biological Rhythms  Work   Early work  = Dinoflagellates = Aside from human chronobiology, Roenneberg has significantly contributed to other aspects of the chronobiology field. He has done extensive work on dinoflagellates, a unicellular organism, and has been able to show that even this simple organism is capable of possessing two independent rhythms, providing evidence that a single cell can have two different oscillators. In addition, his work on dinoflagellates has been able to show that these two independent oscillators differ to a significant extent in that they respond differently when treated with various light pulses. They found that the two oscillators have varying sensitivities to different types of light. The B-oscillator is most sensitive to blue light while the A oscillator is sensitive to both blue and red light. = Neurospora crassa = Roenneberg has also completed work on Neurospora crassa, determining the masking qualities of entrainment through a Frequency (gene)-null circadian oscillator. He observed in the period of spore production (conidia bands) the phenomenon of masking, an unexpected effect on circadian entrainment due to a particular zeitgeber (such as light or temperature). Masking has significant implications not only for future studies – which must attempt to demask affected data – but also in relation to entrainment in everyday life.  Current work  = Chronotype questionnaire = One of Till Roenneberg's most renowned accomplishments is the development of the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ). As a collaboration with Martha Merrow at LMU Munchen, the MCTQ samples sleep and circadian rhythm data from more than 25,000 participants. Unlike other chronotyping methods, which address the psychology of sleep, the MCTQ measures the phase angle of entrainment, the difference between an organism's intrinsic circadian period and the environmental light cycle. Thus, this questionnaire is the first to use a biological foundation, rather than psychology to determine the basis of sleep schedules. Questions about work day and free day sleep schedules, work details, and lifestyle provide data to aid in the understanding of the interplay of biological clocks and social influences. Such research has led Roenneberg to his theory of social jet lag. The MCTQ categorizes each participant into one of seven chronotype groups and utilizes data on participants’ midsleep phase and sleep debt to survey what “type” of sleeper each person is, such as late sleepers, slightly late sleepers, early sleepers, and others. From these data, the MCTQ offers methods to make up for sleep debt (if any), and offers suggestions on what to do to wake up earlier or sleep later. This chronotype questionnaire is important because it delves into the social aspects of circadian rhythms. By testing behavior rather than directly testing genetic factors, the MCTQ may offer new information regarding how the effects of external factors, including geographic location, seasons, obesity, social jet lag, or shift work, may relate to genetic predispositions of circadian rhythms. = Internal time = Roenneberg released a book in March 2012 titled Internal Time: Chronotypes, Social Jet Lag, and Why You're So Tired where he explains the concepts behind circadian rhythm to the masses. One of the major points in his book is, \\"Early birds and night owls are born, not made.\\" Roenneberg wanted to rid people of labels such as \\"lazy\\" that frequently get placed upon those who wake up late. With this book, he wanted to deliver his point that these sleep patterns are due to people's genetics and are not from choice. He discusses how everyone is born with an internal clock, and living a lifestyle in dissonance with this inherent biological clock puts individuals at greater risk for health problems. Roenneberg introduces the term “social jet lag,\\" saying it is more dangerous than normal jet lag because social jet lag forces individuals to persistently go against their biological clock in a consistent light/dark cycle. In this book, he defines social jet lag as “the difference between midsleep on free days and midsleep on work days.\\" Free days are defined as days without an alarm clock, where one naturally wakes up, and work days where one wakes up with an alarm clock. Midsleep is defined as the midpoint of an individual's sleeping period. One of the significant health risks of social jet lag is obesity, and Roenneberg claims that for every hour of social jet lag, the probability of being overweight increases by approximately 33%. In fact, social jet lag is so prevalent that Roenneberg claims that 87% of the population of Central Europe suffers from social jet lag to some degree. Roenneberg also claims that adolescents, biologically, have an internal clock that causes their midsleep to fall later than young infants and adults. Thus, teenagers are not lazy, but are simply following their internal rhythms by going to sleep later and waking up later. This late midsleep pattern changes after adolescence, but at different points for men and women. Women's midsleep changes around age eighteen, while men's midsleep changes at the age of twenty-one. Forcing teenagers to wake up early, against their internal rhythms, leads to stress. As many studies have shown, stress leads to unhealthy decisions such as smoking and drinking.

In the book, Fortuyn sharply criticizes the then ruling \\"Purple\\" coalition government and its direct predecessor (both composed of PvdA, VVD and D66) on nearly all areas of their policies. The book went on to become the first and only bestseller for Fortuyn, whose previous writing career had not yielded any great successes. Puinhopen was reprinted more than nine times, and had sold 270,000 copies by its tenth anniversary in 2012. De puinhopen van acht jaar paars was termed by many Dutch media, as well as by Fortuyn himself, the official election manifesto of the Pim Fortuyn List (of which Fortuyn was the founder and lijsttrekker), but Fortuyn later retracted these claims. History In August 2001, Pim Fortuyn declared he was going to enter national politics. Although at that time he had not yet aligned himself with the recently founded Livable Netherlands, he did express his intention to release a book later on that year which would be titled Acht jaar wachtlijsten (Eight years of waiting lists) and would reflect on the two consecutive Purple administrations. When Livable Netherlands asked him to be their lijsttrekker, Fortuyn declared that their electoral manifesto had to be in line with his upcoming book. Acht jaar wachtlijsten was at first to be released by the formerly Marxist publisher Van Gennep, which had also published a previous work by Fortuyn. However, Van Gennep parted ways with Fortuyn in November 2001 when the latter became close to confirmation as lijsttrekker of Livable Netherlands, citing the incompatibility between their Marxist roots and the party's political positions. Karakter B.V., an imprint of Uithoorn, was announced as taking over as publisher. After Fortuyn and Livable Netherlands ended their cooperation, Fortuyn founded his own party called the \\"Pim Fortuyn List\\". Whenever he was asked what his new party's policies were going to be, Fortuyn generally referred to his soon to be published book by way of answer. In February 2002, Fortuyn reported to de Volkskrant that this book was now to be called De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars. On this occasion, he also said that his rationale for authoring it was the perceived laziness of the Dutch media. \\"As you may know, the press is too lazy to read anyway. So I have summarized my thirteen books in De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars,\\" Fortuyn was quoted as saying. Synopsis De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars is divided into ten chapters (including an epilogue). Each of these chapters addresses one aspect of the Purple government's policies that, in Fortuyn's view, required \\"unreserved criticism\\". The chapters are titled politics (this chapter also serves as an introduction to the rest of the book), healthcare, education, security, restyling of the welfare state, agriculture and infrastructure, public government, immigration policy, and foreign affairs. Publication Release of the book was planned for March 14, but it was accidentally available two days earlier because the publisher failed to instruct book shops about the embargo for the intended date. In many stores, the book sold out on March 12, and the initial printing of 10,000 was already almost exhausted by March 13; a second printing, again of 10,000 copies, had already been ordered one day prior. Fortuyn's assassination on May 6 helped to augment the sales of Puinhopen even further. Between May 6 and May 16, 2002, Karakter had to order three new printings together consisting of over 25,000 copies, bringing total circulation up until that point to 125,000. The book went on to become one of the biggest commercial hits of the Dutch book trade in 2002, selling over 150,000 copies in the year of its release alone. That year De puinhopen van acht jaar paars was the best-selling non-fiction book in the Netherlands, the third overall best-selling book (after Nicci French's Land of the Living and Donna Tartt's The Little Friend), and the best-selling book by a Dutch author. Sales of De puinhopen van acht jaar paars fell off in the summer of 2002. However, in May 2003, coinciding with the first commemoration of Fortuyn's death, Puinhopen saw a small sales figure jump, with book stores purchasing \\"hundreds\\" of copies to sell to their customers. In the run-up to the tenth commemoration of Fortuyn's death in 2012, Karakter announced the total sales of Puinhopen to be 270,000. On May 14 of that year, an e-book version of the book was released. Pieing incident Fortuyn claimed he was able to share a laugh about the incident, but felt bruised in his integrity nonetheless. On March 14, Fortuyn officially presented De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars in the political society Nieuwspoort (News gate) in The Hague. The event garnered massive press attendance as Fortuyn had become a major agenda setter. During the conference, Fortuyn was pied by members of the Biologische bakkers Brigade (literally: \\"biological bakers' brigade\\"), a radical left-wing movement who claimed that Fortuyn's \\"racism\\" should not be given \\"a voice\\", as well as wishing Fortuyn's party to receive \\"zero seats\\" in the upcoming elections. On her way out of Nieuwspoort, one of the perpetrators claimed she attacked Fortuyn with a pie because she felt what she referred to as Fortuyn's racism was not a matter of opinion, but should be treated as a felony. After this incident, Fortuyn began expressing fear of being murdered. After resumption of the event he scolded prime minister Wim Kok for not protecting all of his citizens. Fortuyn's supporters also blamed the attending journalists for not doing anything to stop the pie attacks. Reception Job Frieszo of the television news program NOS Journaal reviewed the book on its release day, calling it \\"unusual\\" for an election manifesto to reflect the opinion of just one individual. Ideas like withdrawing from the Schengen Agreement were branded \\"unrealistic\\". Current affairs show Nova / Den Haag Vandaag called it the \\"funniest election manifesto so far\\". Hubert Smeets of NRC Handelsblad wrote a generally negative review of the book, in which he compared Fortuyn to a burglar and rejected his ideas as duplicitous. \\"Things could get crowded with shopping carts and cardboard boxes in the hallways of the non-privatised railway stations or other indoor places\\", he concludes. Kees Lunshof of De Telegraaf was negative as well, claiming Puinhopen was \\"pubtalk\\", \\"nonsense\\" and \\"asocial\\", whereas Het Parool writer Kees Tamboer praised Fortuyn's plans for amending the law on sick leave in The Netherlands. In an op-ed of May 2012, De Volkskrant columnist Martin Sommer dubbed Puinhopen \\"indeed an unusual pamphlet\\". Citing Fortuyn's reference to his departed mother and his colorful language, Sommer saw a world of differences between it and election manifestos of, for instance, the CDA and PvdA parties. Political reaction Political response to Puinhopen came immediately. On March 14, while the press conference on the book's release was still going on, members of the Socialist Party approached Fortuyn with a pamphlet containing their party's analysis of Fortuyn's views. It was titled Leest u zijn boeken maar – de pimpelpaarse antwoorden van Pim Fortuyn (Just read his books – the deep purple responses from Pim Fortuyn) and concluded that Fortuyn embraced right-wing solutions to problems caused by right-wing politics. According to the socialists, if Fortuyn's policies were adopted he would be even more purple than the Purple administrations themselves. However, SP leader Jan Marijnissen also lambasted other political leaders who thought reading the book was not worth their time. The lijsttrekker of the CDA, Jan Peter Balkenende, agreed with the SP's criticism that Fortuyn offered only purple solutions. Balkenende was negative about Fortuyn's \\"return to the government\\" when looking for solutions, as well as his calls for ending the year-on-year increases in the respective healthcare and education budgets. The reception of Puinhopen from the ruling PvdA and VVD parties was largely negative. Although prime minister Wim Kok considered Puinhopen to be \\"a good read\\", he criticized Fortuyn for penning \\"the most abhorrent accusations\\" against his administration. According to Kok, Fortuyn's claims were \\"on the edge of being acceptable\\". Ad Melkert, the lijsttrekker of the PvdA, stated that Fortuyn would make the Netherlands \\"less strong, and less social\\", while VVD party leader and lijsttrekker Hans Dijkstal stated that he \\"held his breath\\" when reading the book, and lamented the absence of a paragraph stating the financial consequences of Fortuyn's ideas. Legacy The title of the book (sometimes simply stated as De puinhopen van Paars) has gained widespread notoriety to depict the policies of the first and the second Kok cabinets in a negative way. Occasionally the term has also been applied to the second Rutte cabinet at the start of the 2012-2017 legislature (particularly by Geert Wilders) or as a synonym for Fortuyn's 2002 general election campaign. On the last page of Puinhopen, Fortuyn promised a sequel, which he planned to release in four years' time, at the end of the next legislature, and in which he would dwell on the successes and failures of his parliamentary career. This sequel never saw the light of day, because Fortuyn was shot and killed on May 6, 2002. On April 25 a group of Dutch comedians released a book parodying Puinhopen called De puinhopen van professor Pim Fortuyn (The Wreckage of Professor Pim Fortuyn). According to its authors, the aim was to show the audience that everyone was able to write a book filled with \\"stupid plans\\". Although initial sales of the parody book were good, 10,000 copies within the first few days of its release, it was pulled off the market following Fortuyn's death. Puinhopen also inspired Flemish N-VA politician Geert Bourgeois to write De puinhoop van paars-groen (The wreckage of purple-green) in late 2002, which – like Fortuyn's book, which attacked the current Dutch administration – had been written to accuse the then current cabinet of Belgium of misgovernment. According to Bourgeois, the word puinhopen was the only justified term to summarize three years of Purple-Green.

In 1929, Giușcă obtained a scholarship at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, after which he worked in Germany at the laboratories of Paul Niggli and Wilhelm Eitel. After returning to Romania in 1931, he taught at the University of Bucharest and conducted research at the Geologic Institute. At the age of 33, he became a lecturer (conferențiar) and at the age of 44, he became a professor. Dan Giușcă was elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy in 1963 and a titular member in 1974.Rădulescu, p.5 Throughout his career he published over 130 scientific articles and books.

He studied the chemical structure of Nagyágite, contact metamorphism at Băița Bihorului and discovered a new of deposit zeolites.Rădulescu, p.4 In the Hinghiș Mountains, he studied granitic rocks, while in the Vlădeasa Massif he studied volcanic phenomena and the associated hydrothermal metamorphism. Giușcă studied the granitic rocks of the Pricopan Ridge in Northern Dobruja, arguing for a magmatic origin of the epidote. During the 1950s, Giușcă began studying a new field: neogene volcanism and old metamorphism in the Carpathians. His studies included the neogene vulcanites of the Gutâi Mountains. He continued studying mesozoic magmatism through the study of banatites and ophiolites in the Apuseni Mountains.

It comprised two pagi (\\"counties\\"): Monteveglio south of the Via Aemilia and Persiceto to the north. The pagus of Persiceto and the duchy as a whole were named for its chief fortress, the Castrum Persiceta. In this region in 752, King Aistulf granted his brother-in-law Anselm land on which to build a monastery, Nonantola. The dukes of Persiceta were early patrons of Nonantola, and along with the kings gave it vast tracts of land amounting to about 400 square kilometres.Everett (2003), 294. Persiceta and Nonantola formed a common bulwark against Byzantine Italy, which Liutprand made no further attempt to occupy.Brown (1995), 327. The earliest recorded duke was a Friulian, Ursus I, around 750. His son John was duke between 772 and 776, during which period the Franks conquered the kingdom. John's son, Ursus II, was sent as a child to Nonantola, tonsured as a monk and in 789 gave all his earthly goods to the monastery his father had already well endowed. This land was later leased back to the townsfolk and serves as the basis for the Partecipanza, a form of agricultural cooperative. Under the Franks the duchy became a pagus ruled by a gastald, eventually attached to Modena and ultimately, in 908, to Bologna.\\"San Giovanni\\" Enciclopedia Italiana (1936).

Calandra received his bachelor's degree in Chemistry from Brooklyn College in 1935. He taught there while pursuing his PhD at NYU, where he received an MA in 1938. and a PhD in Chemistry in 1940. Career Calandra was a visiting professor of Chemistry at the University of Chicago from 1945-1948, acting as assistant to Enrico Fermi, at which time Calandra shifted the focus of his studies from chemistry to physics. During this period, Fermi was working on the nuclear bomb. Fermi brought Calandra to the attention of the Nobel laureate physicist Arthur Holly Compton, and when Compton moved to St Louis to become chancellor of Washington University in 1948, he invited Calandra there, to develop a program of science education for liberal arts students. Calandra advocated for \\"science as organized common sense.\\" In 1969 Calandra joined the faculty of Webster College as chairman of the science department, where he worked to develop programs until 1980. He also served on the Ministry of Education in Jamaica. He also taught in the department of Physics at Washington University in Saint Louis from 1948 until retirement in 1979. Calandra served as a consultant to the school systems in St. Louis and other areas. An article in the New York Times of January 25, 1964, (\\"Grade Schools Accused of Stressing Sensation and Ignoring Basic Facts, 'Sputnik Panic' Blamed: Professor of Physics Tells at Parley Here of Two Major Defects\\"), outlined Dr. Calandra's views, as presented to a symposium on elementary school science teaching at the annual meeting of the American Association of Physics Teachers. He was an educational consultant for several institutions and foundations, including the Ford Foundation, the Thomas Alva Edison Foundation, and the National Science Foundation. He also consulted for the Educational Testing Service (then called the Cooperative Test Service). Calandra died March 8, 2006. He was survived by his wife, Martha Olmsted Calandra, and their three daughters. Angels on the Head of a Pin Calandra was an advocate of non-traditional teaching and learning methods. His 'Barometer Story', which came to be known as \\"Angels on the Head of a Pin\\", continues to be widely read and discussed. It first appeared in 1961 in Calandra's book, \\"The Teaching of Elementary Science and Mathematics\\" Washington University Press, St. Louis, 1961. It was popularized through its appearance in 'The Saturday Review\\" (Dec. 21, 1968, p. 60), with the title \\"Angels on the Head of a Pin. A Modern Parable\\". The story has since been published (in both legal and illegal formats) hundreds of times. An article written by John A. Osmundsen in the New York Times, entitled \\"Science Teacher Chides Teachers: Tale of a Student Outlines an 'Unscientific Method.\\" and including a photo of Calandra, appeared on March 8, 1964. Osmundsen discussed the story as an attack on closed-minded teaching methods, advocating encouragement of nontraditional problem-solving techniques. Honors In 1979 Calandra received the Robert A. Millikan award for excellence in the teaching of Physics. A biography by Albert A Bartlett (University of Colorado) was written at the time., where he describes Calandra as having \\"devoted a lifetime to the challenging task of imparting an interest in and an understanding of science to students of all ages.\\" His correspondence with Richard Feynman (dating 1968-1979) is at Caltech, in the Feynman Papers.

In a racing career which lasted from July 1835 until April 1837 he won eleven of his fifteen races. He finished second in his four defeats, two of which came when he was matched against the undefeated Bay Middleton. As a two-year-old he won five of his six races including the Chesterfield Stakes, Molecomb Stakes, Clearwell Stakes and Criterion Stakes. In 1836 he rebounded from a defeat by Bay Middleton in the 2000 Guineas to win Drawing-room Stakes, Racing Stakes, and Lewes Stakes in the summer. Elis was one of the first horses to be transported by horsebox and landed a major betting coup for his owners by winning the St Leger. He had limited impact as a sire of winners before being exported to Germany. Background Elis was a chestnut horse with a white blaze and long white socks on his hind legs bred by Charles Greville. He was the seventh of ten foals produced by Olympia (1815-1840), a daughter of Sir Oliver. Olympia produced several other good winners including Stockport and Epirus. His sire, Langar (1817-1841) won the Gascoigne Stakes at Doncaster and many races in Ireland. He stood as a stallion in Ireland before moving to stand at Tickhill Castle in Yorkshire in 1831. Elis was owned by Lord George Bentinck, but in an attempt to hide his interest in racing from his family Bentinck did not use his own name. Elis was officially owned by Charles Greville for his first two starts and by Thomas Anson, 1st Earl of Lichfield for the remainder of his racing career. Elis was trained by John Kent at Goodwood and by John Doe at Newmarket and was ridden in most of his races by John Barham Day. Racing career 1835: two-year-old season Elis was one of the best British two- year-olds of 1835, winning five of his six races. Until 1913, there was no requirement for British racehorses to have official names, and the horse who later became known as Elis began his career as Mr. Greville's Brother to Stockport. He made his racing debut at the July meeting at Newmarket Racecourse where he was one of fourteen two-year-olds to contest the Chesterfield Stakes over the last half of the Bunbury Mile course. Ridden by Day, he started the 4/1 third favourite and won from William Chifney's brother to Glaucus, the winner of the July Stakes. On his next appearance, Elis (now officially named) was ridden by Nat Flatman in the Molecomb Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse on 30 July. Carrying top weight of 120 pounds, he started odds-on favourite and won by half a length from Skirmisher. Elis was rested until the autumn, when he ran at Newmarket's Second October meeting, where Day took over again as his jockey. On 13 October he started second favourite behind Colonel Peel's colt Slane for the Clearwell Stakes. He won the five furlong race from the filly Marmalade, with Slane unplaced. Three days later, Elis sustained his only defeat of the season when he finished second by a length to the Duke of Grafton's colt Alumnus in the Prendergast Stakes. Two weeks later, Elis had two engagements at the Newmarket Houghton meeting. On 26 October he started 6/4 favourite for the Criterion Stakes under top weight of 120 pounds, and led from the start to win \\"cleverly\\" by half a length from Slane with Mr Wags in third place. Three days later he walked over for a sweepstakes over the Abington Mile, after the other nineteen horses entered were withdrawn by their owners. 1836: three-year-old season Elis began his second season in the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket on 17 April. He started at odds of 5/2, but the 6/4 favourite was Lord Jersey's Riddlesworth Stakes winner Bay Middleton. Elis was beaten by a neck by Bay Middleton after a vigorously contested finish, with the pair finishing well clear of the other four runners. The New Sporting Magazine commented that \\"two faster or gamer horses have seldom been opposed to each other\\". Elis had not been entered in The Derby and did not race again until the Goodwood meeting at the end of July. He started 1/2 favourite for the Drawing-room Stakes and won by three lengths from Magician and six other three-year-olds. Two days later he was matched against older horses in the Goodwood Cup and finished second to the four-year-old Hornsea, with the St Leger winner Rockingham among the unplaced runners. On the same afternoon he won the one-mile Racing Stakes from two opponents at odds of 1/10. On 10 August, Elis appeared at Lewes Racecourse in Sussex where he won the all-aged Lewes Stakes over one and a half miles from six opponents. From as early as the autumn 1835, Elis had been regarded as a leading contender for the St Leger at Doncaster Racecourse in late September, but when the horse was still in Goodwood a week before the race his chances appeared remote. In the 1830s, the established way for a horse to travel to a racecourse was to walk there, usually at a very gentle pace to minimise the risk of injury, and the 250 mile journey from Goodwood to Doncaster could take up to three weeks. Despite the fact that it appeared impossible for Elis to run in the St Leger he continued to be supported in the betting, which led to considerable confusion until Bentinck's plans were revealed. A specially designed carriage or \\"caravan\\" had been constructed which could be drawn at high speed by a team of horses whose members could be replaced at regular intervals. Elis and a travelling companion named The Drummer were loaded into the padded interior of the caravan and were transported to Doncaster in less than three days: there was even time to pause and give the horses an exercise gallop at Lichfield Racecourse. The project had been kept secret to allow Bentinck and his confederates to back the horse at longer odds than would otherwise been available. On 20 September, Elis started at odds of 7/2 for the St Leger, with the John Scott-trained Scroggins being made the 6/4 favourite in what was considered an unusually strong field. Ridden as usual by John Day, Elis took the lead at half way and was never seriously challenged, winning easily from Scroggins, who got the better of a \\"neck and neck\\" struggle with Beeswing for second place. The connections of the winner were reported to have taken approximately £24,000 in winning bets. Two weeks after his victory at Doncaster, Elis was back at Newmarket for a rematch with Bay Middleton at the First October meeting. The presence of the \\"extraordinary pair\\" of classic- winning colts in the Grand Duke Michael Stakes led to the other twenty-two horses being withdrawn by their owners. Elis was beaten a length by the 2/5 favourite, but gave Bay Middleton the hardest race of his career. Elis ended his season in a ten furlong sweepstakes at the Newmarket Houghton meeting on 3 November. He ran a dead heat with Mr Wags to whom he was conceding eight pounds, and the owners decided to divide the prize money rather than running a deciding heat. 1837: four-year-old season Elis was kept in training as a four-year-old but made only one appearance. At the Newmarket Craven meeting on 12 April he ran a match race against Slane over the Ditch Mile course. He conceded seven pounds to his opponent and won at odds of 1/3 to claim a 300 Guinea prize. Late in 1837, Bentinck bought Bay Middleton and sold Elis to Sidney Herbert. Elis had been scheduled to run a match over five furlongs against a filly named Vulture at Newmarket in October but did not appear for the race. Retirement and stud career Elis was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. He spent his British stud career at Wilton House, near Salisbury in Wiltshire at a fee of 20 guineas. In 1844 he was sold and exported to Germany. Elis was not a great success as a sire: his best runner was probably Lucy Banks, a filly who won the Craven Stakes and the Goodwood Stakes although three of his German-bred daughters won the Preis der Diana. In May 2012, the Welbeck Abbey Brewery named one of its speciality Mild ales Elis in honour of the horse.

France, Les Guides Bleu, English series, Nagel, p. 170. (, ) is a timber-framed house of post-and-beam construction, that is infilled with adobe bricks and is typical of the Bresse region of eastern France. A large hip roof protects the delicate masonry from rain and snow. The house is almost always oriented in a north–south direction, the roof on the north side often being lower. This configuration offers the optimum protection from the bise, a cold northerly wind typical of the region, which is deflected over the house by the low, sweeping roof on the northern gable end. The living rooms are on the south side, the main façade facing the morning sun. Usually each room has one or two outside doors, so that no space is sacrificed for passages. Bresse house and open-air museum in Courtes, in the French département of Ain The large cantilevered roof is supported on corbels or buttresses, the eaves being further supported on a second set of shorter rafters, resulting in a double-pitched roof. The eaves enable equipment or supplies to be stored around the outside of the house and kept dry. They also enable corn cobs to be hung from the rafters to dry out. The countryside of the Bresse is characterized by agricultural buildings; the villages often suffer from overdevelopment; the farmsteads are usually far from these villages, by lakes, streams, woods and where possible on slight eminences. Bresse house with corbels that support the lower part of the double-pitch roof  Features  Timber framing, 14th-15th century Timber framing, 19th century  Timber framing  Whilst the timber framing of the 14th and 15th centuries was still simple and large-scale, in the 16th to 18th centuries ever more complicated designs evolved, on one hand to give the building greater stability, and on the other for decorative reasons. Especially popular were crossed struts that formed a St. Andrew's Cross. Timber framed buildings continued to be erected until the mid-19th century. Then there was a change: in the southern Bresse rammed earth (Stampflehm) was increasingly used for the walls, which usually had reinforced corners of brick or stone, and the façades were covered with rammed earth. In the northern Bresse, brick has generally been used since the 19th century, albeit bricks of low quality. At the same time, the hips on the gable ends were shortened to create a half-hipped roof or even a simple gable roof, with the eaves on the gable ends disappearing almost completely. Timber framing, 16th-18th century  Farmstead forms  Two forms of farmstead predominated. On the one hand there was the unit farmhouse,Frontenard, 12 rue de la Motte (Base Mérimée des Ministère de la Culture) which was partitioned transversely and where, in most cases, the threshing floor was in the middle of the house; on the other hand there was the two-sided farm with the farmhouse on one side and outbuildings on the other. The main farmhouse was usually oriented in a north-south direction, but there were often variations in which the building was oriented northeast to southwest. When erecting the houses, builders appear to have taken account of the direction of the sun, in particular to ensure that the morning sun shone into the living rooms. As construction activity took place mainly in winter, outside the busy summer season, there was often a deviation in alignment. Very rarely, buildings oriented from northwest to southeast may be found.Untersuchungen in Romenay und in den Kantonen Saint-Germain-du-Bois und Pierre-de-Bresse, gemäß L'Habitation paysanne en Bresse. p. 39. The farmstead consisted of at least three areas: * Living quarters * Stables and fodder store (threshing floor) * Bakehouse with pigsty and chicken coop There could be separate buildings for each of these functions, or the living quarters, fodder store and stables could be arranged one after another to form an elongated building. The living quarters were usually found along the western side of the farmyard. Where the buildings were separate, the threshing barn and stables would be built in succession along the eastern side of the yard. The bakehouse and quarters for the smaller livestock were usually found in the northeastern part of the farm. In southeastern Bresse, properties were occasionally built to an angular design.

The ruling family of Qatar, the House of Thani, is deeply involved in the field of art. For more than twenty years, some of its members have been accumulating numerous and precious pieces of artwork. The project Qatar National Vision 2030 promotes the creation of new schools, new universities and new museums. The Cultural development, characterized by new museums and exhibitions, is therefore closely linked to the political motive of building a “knowledge-based economy” in Qatar by 2030. The journalist Barbara Pollack underlines the central role of the Al-Thani family while comparing Qatar's and Abu Dhabi’s cultural policies: \\"While Abu Dhabi is making a name for itself by building dramatic local satellites of the Louvres, the Guggenheim and the British Museum, Qatar's scheme of cultural nation building is much more homegrown, establishing its own museums rooted in the collections of its own royal family.\\"  Collecting strategy of the Al-Thani family   Active members of the royal family  Several members of the Al-Thani family initially led Qatar's interest and involvement into the field of arts and continue to embody and shape the cultural policy of the country. For William Lawrie, previously Head of International Modern Contemporary Arab and Iranian Art at Christie's, “Qatar’s royal family are very much like modern-day equivalents of the Medicis in 16th-century Florence”. * Sheikh Saud’s older brother, Hassan bin Mohamed bin Ali Al Thani owns one of the most extensive collections of modern Arab art in the world, estimated at 6,300 pieces. While studying Art in Qatar University in the mid-1980s, he became deeply interested in 20th-century Arabic painting, and most particularly in Iraqi painters.[Christian Chesnot,Georges Malbrunot, Qatar: les clés du coffre-fort] Aware that art in general was \\"absent from Qatari life\\" at that time, he pursued the discovery of Arab artists.[Sajjil: A Century of Modern Art], Nada Shabout, Wassan Al- khudhairi, Deena Chalabi. If Sheikh Hassan’s collection was primarily developed out of his personal interest in art and was not directed towards a specific audience, it now forms the core of the Mathaf museum. * Saud bin Muhammed Al Thani, Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani's cousin and former president of Qatar's National Council for culture, Arts and Heritage possesses a large collection of traditional art pieces, such as manuscripts, carpets, scientific instruments and Mughai Jewellery. He largely contributes at establishing collections for five existing and planned museums: the Museum of Islamic Art, the National Library, the Natural History Museum, a photography museum and a traditional textiles and clothes museum. * The emir's daughter Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani now embodies the involvement of Qatar's ruling family in art. As head of the Qatar Museums Authority (QMA), she is \\"arguably the most powerful woman in the art world today\\", according to the magazine Forbes, which ranked her among the 100 most powerful women of the world in 2012. In 2011, Art+Auction magazine ranked her number one for the art world’s most influential people.Qatari Emir's daughter named art world’s most influential person . According to Benjamin Genocchio, editor in chief of Art+Auction, \\"Sheikha Al-Mayassa has the resources of an entire country at her disposal.\\"  Qatari presence on the art market  Qatar is depicted as a new \\"market maker\\" on the art market. In 2011, The Art Newspaper revealed Qatar is the world’s biggest art buyer.Qatar revealed as the world’s biggest contemporary art buyer - The Art Newspaper Many commentators report a faultless strategy:dohapress - Qatar a top player in art, museum markets Qatar bid systematically for famous pieces of art. It is a pragmatic but visionary approach that led the country to establish itself as a main player of the world art market. Qatar is advised by high-skilled international experts. Thierry Ehrmann, president and founder of Artprice (\\"the world leader in art market information\\") asserts that Qatar has implemented an “outstanding war machine” to make of Doha a “world capital of art”. According to him: \\"Qatar does not take any risk, takes the best and is willing to pay whatever it takes.\\"  Large financial resources  One of the most striking facts about Qatar's presence on the art market is the massive financial resources involved. The royal family and Qatar's cultural institution are upscale subscribers to the databank on art prices and indices Artprice Group. A study conducted by Artprice and Organ Museum Research over the period 2000-2012 revealed that Qatar bid for art works with a margin of 40 to 45% above \\"market prices\\". Hence Forbes Magazine estimates that the annual budget for the sole Qatar Museum Authority is about $250 million. The chief executive of the Fine Art Fund Group, an art investment management and consulting firm based in London, estimates that Qatari buyers make up to 25 percent of the Middle East's $11 billion art market.  Al-Thani's art collection: overview  Audubon, Snowy Owl For more than twenty years, the Al- Thani family had been buying a large collection of art works, from traditional Islamic artifacts to famous pieces of modern and contemporary art  Antiques  Partly as a consequence of Sheikh Saud's significant interest into traditional art, the Al-Thani family possesses a wide collection of Islamic, Roman and Egyptian art and antiques, alongside a wide range of artifacts from all over the world. The collection includes: * Artifacts (glass, carpets, astrolables) * Korans, manuscripts * Rare books, including a complete set of John James Audubon's Birds of AmericaBirds Of America’ Sells for $8.8 Million, Art&Antiques.; * Persian miniatures * Fine jewellery * 18th-century French furniture * Natural history prints and specimens  Western art  Estimates show that the Al-Thani has spent at least $1 billion on Western painting and sculpture over the last twenty years. Sheikha Al-Mayassa is known for being particularly interested in the work of Western contemporary art's big names, such as Jeff Koons, Takashi Murakami, Damien Hirst, Richard Serra, Louise Bourgeois and Mark Rothko . The royal family of Qatar currently owns one painting of the series The Card Players by the French artist Paul Cézanne. Paul Cézanne, The Card Players As a prominent buyer on the art market, the Al- Thani family has significantly expanded its modern art collection. The family owns notably: * Mark Rothko's painting White Center (Yellow, Pink and Lavender on Rose) * Francis Bacon's Study from Innocent X * Damien Hirst's Lullaby Spring  Middle-Eastern and North African art  In addition to building collections of works by international artists, the Al-Thani family is committed to developing Arab contemporary art and supporting regional artists. The credit goes in the first place to Sheikh Hassan bin Mohamed bin Ali Al Thani, who began buying Arab art in the mid-1980s while very little attention had been carried out on the region's artistic movements. In 1986, he started collaborating with the artist and art educator Yousef Ahmad. Hassan Al-Thani supported Iraqi artists after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the first Gulf War. He owns an extensive collection of art pieces produced by two of the most well-known Iraqi artists Ismail Fatah Al Turk and Shakir Hassan Al Said. His collection of Iraqi art is known as the biggest in the world.Art in Qatar: A Smithsonian in the sand, The Economist. According to Antonia Carver, Fair Director of Art Dubai, \\"News about Cézanne and Damien Hirst hits headlines, but it’s perhaps these more localized forms of patronage — such as Sheik Hassan’s care for Iraqi artists over several decades — that are particularly meaningful within the region.\\" The exhibition for the opening of Mathaf in December 2010 featured art pieces of several Arab artists, such as: * French artists of Algerian origin Kader Attia and Zineb Sedira * Iraqi Adel Abidin * Palestinian Khalil Rabah * Moroccans Farid Belkahia and Mounir Fatmi * Egyptians Ahmed Nouar and Ghada Amer * Lebanese Walid Raad  Photography  Saud Al-Thani bought quite important photographs collections, notably 136 vintage photographs including pieces by Alfred Stieglitz and Man Ray in 2000 and a black and white photograph by Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey in 2003 for £565,250, which settled a new world record  Al-Thani's collection displayed: museums and exhibitions  With such wide art collections, Qatar proceeds for several years to build museums and to sponsor exhibition to host them. It makes part of Qatar's strategy to be acknowledged as a main worldwide actor.  Museums  Museum of Islamic Art, Doha, designed by I.M. Pei = Qatar Museums Authority = One significant innovation has been the establishment of the Qatar Museums Authority in 2005, a government body that cooperates with the Culture Ministry but which is, according to The Economist, \\"above all a family affair\\". Interviewed by the English newspaper, Sheikha Al- Mayassa asserts, \\"The QMA is very much my father’s baby. He wanted to create something to connect with the community, to create a cultural dialogue within society (…) we want the QMA to be a 'cultural instigator', a catalyst of arts projects worldwide.\\" = Museum of Islamic Art = Qatar's ambition to become the most important cultural destination of the Gulf’s area was made concrete in 2008 with the opening of the MIA, the Museum of Islamic Art. It was designed by I.M. Pei, the Chinese-American architect that notably built the glass pyramid for the Louvre in Paris. It is considered to be one of the world’s great museums.Museum of Islamic Art in Doha. * MIA Park The inauguration of the new public space was a key event of the year 2011.

The Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani was present during the inaugural ceremony, along with 700 guests. During her speech, Sheikha Al Mayassa asserted that the new park will invite the citizens of Doha to interact with contemporary and other creative arts.

Based on a collection of paintings and other art pieces from the 1840s, this embryo project aims to give modern art a wider audience in the Arab world. “We are making Qatar the place to see, explore and discuss the creations of Arab artists of the modern era and of our own time” says Sheikha al-Mayassa al-Thani Its originator and most fervent defender, Sheikh Hassan bin Mohamed bin Ali Al Thani explains how the museum was aimed at filling a void in modern Arab art in Qatar: \\"Since the collection had increased its representation of periods and styles, I began planning to make it part of a specific project. At the time, I did not know of any museum of Arab art from the 19th century to today. As a painter and photographer — simply put, as an artist — I was passionate about modern and contemporary art and artistic movements in the Arab world. But only in Egypt could you find quality museums devoted to the history of Arab art and its different forms of expression. Otherwise there was almost nothing anywhere. So instead of continuing in the darkness, I decided to light a light\\".Shining a Light: Sheikh Hassan Al-Thani on Qatar's First Museum of Modern Arab Art. = National Museum of Qatar = One of the biggest projects of Qatar is the opening of the National Museum that was opened in 2019.

The exhibition was later shown in Doha in 2012. The Museum of Islamic Art was initially proposed, yet the Japanese artist found the space not large enough. A temporary hall was built instead, known as the Al Riwaq exhibition space, located near the MIA.Art in the Middle East Dubai & Doha, Sima Familant, 10/05/2012. It is the first exhibition displayed by Murakami in the Middle East. Murakami-Ego was the launching event of Qatar-Japan 2012, an initiative aimed at reinforcing the diplomatic relations between the two countries through a series of cultural and sporting activities. * Louise Bourgeois and Maman From January to June 2012, Qatar Museums Authority organized the exhibition \\"Conscious and Unconscious\\", gathering about 30 works of art created by Louise Bourgeois between 1947 and 2009.Louise Bourgeois: Conscious and Unconscious , QMA. The centrepiece of the exhibition is the famous 9-meter-high bronze spider sculpture Maman. QMA's chairperson, Sheikha Al- Mayassa, commented on the importance of the sculpture to Qatar: \\"Louise Bourgeois' Maman is a true icon of 20th Century art, an artwork that has captured the attention of millions around the world. We are proud to present this magnificent sculpture at the Qatar National Convention Centre. Through displaying various forms of art in public spaces we aim to inspire local talent and to establish an organic connection between art and the local community.\\".QMA unveils new spider sculpture .

It became an international competition in 2006.Thousands of entries for annual Al-Thani award for Photography , The Peninsula Qatar, 05/11/2012.  Controversies  The active participation of the ruling family in the art market has invited some controversy and criticism concerning transaction opacity and the public/private nature of financial resources involved.  Opacity and secrecy  Al Thani family formally refuses to confirm or deny the rumours circulating over the art acquisitions of these past years. It is therefore particularly hard to assess whether these acquisitions are purely private or done on behalf of the State.  Saud al Thani under house arrest in 2005  In 2005, Saud Bin Mohammed Al-Thani was sued for not fulfilling a payment of $20 million for ancient Greek coins. This event rekindled the concerns about his huge spending on art artifacts, estimated at $2.5 billion over eight years.

History He was born in Ekaterinodar (now – Krasnodar), Imperial Russia, the son of deputy district judge. In Ekaterinodar he graduated from high school and conservatory, and in Prague graduated from the Department of Economics of the Czech Technical University and Institute for Agricultural Cooperation, where he taught in the latter 1920s. American period In 1930 moved to the United States, and graduated from Columbia University in New York. Later he became a professor at Columbia, where he taught management courses. He worked in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, at a Wall Street firm, and was a counsellor of the American businessman Roswell Garst. In 1937, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor, Tereshchenko organized and led a large (160 employees) research project to study the world's literature on cooperatives, which was published 12 languages. The work was conducted in close collaboration with the Co-operative League of America, the International Cooperative Alliance in London, the International Labour Office in Geneva, and the Rockefeller Committee for Relations with South America. The Library of Congress assessed the materials collected by project as ‘the most complete in the world’ at that time. The Fundamental Project Edition 'Summaries of laws on cooperatives in the U.S.’ was used to revise the cooperative laws in some states. In this regard, in April 1940 Valeriy Tereshchenko was invited to Committee of the Senate on cooperatives legislation. He along with other employees of the project took part in the establishment of initial economic ties between the U.S. and the Republic of China (1942−1949). Before the end of World War II, the scientist was elected to the Executive Committee of the International Cooperative postwar reconstruction (NY).

It was first isolated in an African wood mouse (Hylomyscus simus) in the forest in Guinea, West Africa in 2010. It is named for the village near where the mouse was trapped. It is the first indigenous Murinae-associated African hantavirus to be discovered. Genome The virus genome consists of three segments of negative-stranded RNA; the large (L) segment encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the medium (M) segment encodes the envelope glycoproteins Gn and Gc (cotranslationally cleaved from a glycoprotein precursor), and the small (S) segment encodes the nucleocapsid (N) protein. Renal syndrome In rodents, hantavirus produces a chronic infection with no adverse sequelae. In humans, hantavirus produces two major clinical syndromes: hemorrhagic fever or pulmonary syndrome. European, Asian, and African rodent-borne hantaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever. The pulmonary syndrome, caused by the species Sin Nombre orthohantavirus, has not been found anywhere other than the United States where deer mice are the natural hosts. It was discovered in 1993 during an outbreak in the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States. Reservoirs Natural reservoirs for this hantavirus species include the slit faced bat, moles, and shrews. Rodent-borne hantaviruses form three major evolutionary clades corresponding to the subfamilies of their rodent hosts. HTNV, SEOV, and DOBV are examples of Murinae-associated hantaviruses. PUUV and Tula orthohantavirus (TULV) belong to the Arvicolinae-associated hantaviruses, and SNV and ANDV are representatives of Neotominae- and Sigmodontinae- associated hantaviruses.

It is aiming and organizing the multifold scientific research of the recent past and the present age. Besides history it is widening its focus on other social sciences as well. It helps the birth of new scientific results with tenders, scholarships, support of individual and team researches. It enables the public usage of the documents of national value kept in the archives and library of the institute. Besides the historical and societal research works, it hosts scientific conferences and cultural events as well. It is a kind of intellectual center that is concentrating first of all on renewing and popularizing social criticism in the widest range of the term. For the publication of the results of the researches the Foundation operates a detached publishing house, Napvilág Kiadó, and publishes the historical quarterly Múltunk (Our Past). The Archives of Political History and of Trade Unions The precursor of the archives was established in 1948. It served as a department of the Institute of Labour Movement of the Hungarian Workers' Party until 1955, of the Institute of Party History of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party from 1957, of the Institute of Political History of the Hungarian Socialist Party between 1989 and 1998, and as a part of the non- profit organization of the Institute of Political History from 1998. Its maintainer is the Foundation of Political History. Before 1989, the archives had been collecting primarily the documents of the pre-1945 legal and illegal movements of the Hungarian labour movement, of the parties of the popular democratic period following the First World War, of the left-wing youth organizations, and of the people connected to these movements and organizations. Now it is storing the documents of the Hungarian Workers' Party and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party as well until 1992. Since 1998 it has been storing the documents of the Hungarian trade-unionist movement that were produced during the period of 1945 to 1989 and which had previously been stored in the Central Archives of Trade Unions. Nowadays the archives are focusing not merely on the political Left, but also on the entire Hungarian history of the modern age. It is endeavoring to trace, collect and preserve the private documentations that are enduring sources of contemporary history, with a special emphasis on the history of the change of regime, 1989. As open proprietary archive, it is handling the documents in its care in accordance with the Hungarian rules set forth for public archives. According to its own rules, the archives are open for research, while the staff is ready to provide the necessary information and supplies data as well. In the care of the archives there are 4298 running-metres of documents, and also 1215 cassettes and tapes, 30 discs and 284 rolls of research films.

Such a policy is usually a response to very slow economic growth, deflation, and deleveraging. During economic downturns, central banks often lower interest rates to stimulate growth. Until late in the 20th century, it was thought that rates could not go below zero because banks would hold onto cash instead of paying a fee to deposit it. It turns out this was not quite right. Central banks in Europe and in Japan have demonstrated rates can go negative, and several have pushed them in that direction for the same reason they lowered them to zero in the first place—to provide stimulus and, where inflation is below target, to raise the inflation rate. The notion is that negative rates will provide even more incentive for commercial banks to make loans. What might have looked like a potential lending project, by a bank, not worth funding even in a low- interest-rate environment might now look attractive if the alternative is being charged to store money at the central bank or holding a large amount of cash. Examples Europe The European Central Bank and central banks of other European countries, such as Sweden, Switzerland, and Denmark, have paid negative interest on excess reserves—in effect taxing banks for exceeding their reserve requirements—as an expansionary monetary policy measure. Negative rates in Europe have been controversial. Ambrose Evans-Pritchard of the London Telegraph has described them as a \\"calamitous misadventure.\\" Economists for the European Central Bank argue that across the euro area, loans from banks to corporations have become less expensive since negative rates were adopted. Japan In January 2016, the Bank of Japan followed European central banks and lowered its interest rates below zero, after several years of keeping them at the lower end of the positive range. The existing balances will keep on yielding a rate of 0.1 percent; the reserves that banks are required to keep at the BOJ will have a rate of zero percent, and a rate of minus 0.1 percent will be applied to any other reserves. United States The staff of the U.S. Federal Reserve prepared a memo for the Federal Open Market Committee in August 2010 evaluating the possibility of lowering the interest rate that the Fed paid on bank reserves to zero or below. The staff was lukewarm on the idea, and it was never adopted in the U.S. Former chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke has argued that \\"negative rates appear to have both modest benefits and manageable costs\\" and \\"modestly negative\\" interest rates should be an option for the Fed to consider if it ever again confronts a very weak economy at a time when short-term interest rates already have been cut to zero.

Despite a long test period in several regional lines, the vehicle never came into regular service.  Technical details  The railcar was designed taking advantage of the experience developed in the construction of 2-decks vehicles gained in Italy by the Casaralta workshops (Bologna) in building railways carriages derived from those in service on the Parisian \\"banlieue\\" and supplied to Ferrovie Nord Milano and Ferrovie dello Stato companies. Such vehicles were built under CIMT Lorraine (a French firm) license. The experiment was focused on the research on a lightweight vehicle with higher capacity than railcars used at that time. The objective was to provide regional and branch lines with such vehicles, with an offer estimated at about 40-50% more passengers than equivalent traditional railcars, despite the \\"low power consumption and a saving of about 20% in investment and running costs\\". It was designed a curious double-decker railcar reminiscent of the similar coaches of the time. The vehicle was built by a company called Cafici International, with headquarters in Geneva; the name came from the initials of the three partners who formed that consortium: Casaralta (Bologna, Italy) CIMT- Lorraine (France) and FIAT Ferroviaria (Savigliano, Italy), a specialist in the construction of lightweight material. The engine was supplied by Fiat (IVECO 828 SRI engine 4-stroke, 8-cylinder V) and installed in only one of the two carriages, which were derived from those equipped on the double-decker coaches then being delivered by Casaralta, with secondary air suspension and brake discs and mixed strains. The arrangement of space was such as to create in practice four distinct rooms: the two vestibules allow access to the front and rear rooms, a total capacity of 17, and the two central decks, with a capacity of 60 seats respectively the upper and 48 lower.  History  Released from the factory in 1982, the following year the vehicle was tested on some lines in Piemonte region, covering several times the Turin-Trofarello and Fossano-Limone Piemonte paths. In 1984, after several weeks of testing on the ACT (Reggio Emilia) network and along the Suzzara-Ferrara Railway (FSF),News on I Treni n. 41, July 1984, p. 7 the railcar moved back in Piemonte and in the French Riviera, where on behalf of the SNCF was the subject of different test runs on the Cuneo-Nice, where the low power of the one engine was put to the test by ramps imposed by the Maritime Alps, highlighting not brilliant performances. The FIAT organized later, in 1986, a further series of test runs on Brescia-Iseo-Edolo (Valcamonica railway) whose owner, SNFT, judged the railcar unsuitable for the demanding services. In the same period, with the formula of loan use, the railcar was also used by SATTI for services on the Canavesana railway. The first buyer of A2n 001 appeared in 1988, when the Swiss association \\"Vapeur Val-de-Traves\\" bought and moved it in its Neuchâtel depot; however, using the railcar on an occasional basis. A new change of ownership took place in 1997, when the railcar was purchased by SNIM - National Society of Industries and Mines of Mauritania which, after installation of air conditioning, aimed to employ it again in a tourist service on the relationship Nouadhibou-Zouérate. Due to the low performance and to its nature as prototype the railcar was finally de-morozed and today is still occasionally used as trailer on tourist service \\"The train of the desert.\\"  Notes   Further reading  * Nico Molino, La ferrovia del Canavese, Elledi, 1986, pp. 70–73. * Sergio Viganò, Automotrici d'avanguardia, in I treni, 17 (1996), n. 174, pp. 20–27 * CFC A2N - L'automotrice Diesel elettrica a due piani, in Tutto Treno & Storia n. 4, novembre 2000, pp. 22–29.

It documents significant storms over and near the Earth's oceans and the Great Lakes of North America, tropical cyclones and extratropical cyclones alike. It is also used as an outreach tool to those who sail the high seas, in order to help gain greater weather reporting from ships at sea through the voluntary observing ship program, which became increasingly important during and after the decline of the weather ship and has taken up an increasing amount of the magazine recently. Although its coverage is primarily of the Northern Hemisphere, coverage of Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclones occurred between July 1973 and 1995.  Purpose  The Mariners Weather Log (MWL) contains articles, news, and information about marine weather events, worldwide environmental impact concerns, climatology studies, storms at sea, and weather forecasting. MWL is dedicated to the National Weather Service (NWS) Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS) Program, Port Meteorological Officers (PMOs), cooperating ship officers, and their vessels. Through the MWL, the VOS program recognizes ship officers for their efforts as voluntary weather observers, and allows the NWS to maintain contact and communicate with over 10,000 shipboard observers worldwide in the merchant marine, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps, United States Coast Guard, United States Navy, and others. MWL is currently published triannually and is distributed via email to mariners, marine institutions, the shipping industry, scientists, educational and research facilities, libraries, government agencies, and offices worldwide in a digital high resolution format.  Content  Throughout its history, there has been an Editor's Desk section, which discussed random items which came to the editor's attention since the previous issue. The Hints to the Observer section gave practical advice to those taking weather observations at sea and ran from the 1960s into the 1980s. The Tips to the Radio Officer section was included from the 1970s through the summer of 1995. Another section was the Monthly Weather Log which documented significant extratropical and tropical cyclone occurrences across the northern Pacific and north Atlantic oceans through the summer of 1995. Through 1981, both a Rough Log and Smooth Log were included, with satellite images of weather systems being primarily included within the Rough Log, and the Smooth Log providing an update concerning systems discussed in the Rough Log during the previous issue, which included delayed ship reports. By 1982, the log format was simplified, with a single log being included to cover the prior three-month period, which substantially shrank the size of the publication. Starting in 1985, surface weather analyses began to be used on a more regular basis, taking the place of some of the many weather satellite images which were previously included. Maps of cyclone tracks were included within the Marine Weather Review section. Within or just after the Weather Logs, a list of ship and weather buoy observations with winds greater than gale-force was published until 1995. Summaries from weather ships were replaced with weather buoy summaries in January 1975. Between July 1973 and 1995, a Hurricane Alley section was added in order to document recent global tropical cyclone occurrences since the publishing of the previous issue. Annual tropical cyclone season articles for the various basins are published early to mid year and discuss activity during the previous season. From the late 1980s through April 1998, a Whale Oil & Wicks column, authored by Elinor DeWire, detailed lighthouses and their keepers. At the end of the publication, a Marine Weather Diary was included during the 1960s and 1970s to detail average weather conditions across Northern Hemisphere waters during the succeeding couple months, to assist sailors out at sea. Since the 1980s, a list of VOS ships has been included near the end of the publication, which has significantly increased in its percentage of the publication size since then.  Format  The physical size of the publication has changed through the years. Between the mid 1980s and 2012, the page size was a standard by , though prior to 1985 the page size was closer to by . Between the late 1960s and mid 1980s, the publication used glossy pages. Between 1957 and the late 1960s, as well as during the late 1980s through the 1990s, a non-glossy paper was used, which led to images which were less sharp and less distinct. Through 1997, the publication was bound with staples in the spine. Between 1998 and April 2012, the paper publication had a physical binding. Beginning in August 1998, MWL became available online. The April 2012 issue was the last print issue, with all following issues issued only in a digital format online.  History  From 1957 through 1966, the United States Weather Bureau's Office of Climatology published the Mariners Weather Log. From 1966 through the summer of 1995, the Environmental Data Service, which became the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service, published the magazine. MWL was published bimonthly from its inception in 1957 into the early 1980s. It was subsequently published quarterly from the early 1980s through 1996. From 1995 onward, the National Weather Service dealt with its production and distribution. In 1997 only one issue was published, the spring issue. In 1998, the publication schedule lengthened to triannually.

Her research focuses on behavioral, physiological, and ecological aspects of mammalian circadian rhythms.DeCoursey’s Textbook: Summary & About the Authors She is credited with creating the first Phase Response Curve (PRC). PRC’s are used throughout the field today to help illustrate the change of a biological oscillation in response to an external stimulus. She currently works as a biology professor at the University of South Carolina (USC). Biography At an early age, DeCoursey expressed much interest in nature. She became fascinated with the outdoors though traveling with her father, a physician, and the rest of her family to remote wilderness areas While attending Hunter College High School in New York City she began collecting data on the songbirds of a hardwood forest in Long Island. She mapped the number and location of the birds as well as their distinctive calls. She entered this project in the 1950 Westinghouse Science Talent Search and was named a finalist along with her twin sister Cynthia (Jackson) Fisher. Education DeCoursey's interest in ornithology led her to Cornell University, where she received a degree in zoology in 1954. She met George DeCoursey, at Cornell University, where he was a student at the time. She married George DeCoursey in 1954. DeCoursey furthered her education at the University of Wisconsin, Madison where she earned a Ph.D. in zoology and biochemistry. She did postdoctoral research with Jürgen Aschoff at the Max- Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology in Erling-Andech, Germany for two years. She then continued her research at Washington State University, Career She is currently a distinguished professor of biology at University of South Carolina where she has continued to further her research on mammalian circadian rhythms since she moved there with her husband in 1966. Contributions to chronobiology Phase Response Curve Decoursey is credited with the first published Phase Response Curve (PRC). The relevant paper was about flying squirrels kept in constant darkness and how they would respond to different pulses of light at different times of the day. The compilation of this data produced the first PRC.Zivkovic, Bora; aka \\"Coturnix\\" (2007). \\"Clock Tutorial #3c - Darwin On Time\\". A Blog Around the Clock. ScienceBlogs LLC) Mammalian Entrainment System DeCoursey was the first scientists to show that the mammalian clocks can be reset by light pulses. She also showed that the photoreceptive system responsible for entrainment is different from the system involved in visual image perception. Adaptive Value DeCoursey helped the scientific world understand the adaptive value of the mammalian biological clocks (found within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)). From April 1997-October 1998 she set up an enclosure for approximately 74 chipmunks. 30 chipmunks had lesions in their SCN, 24 others were surgical control and 20 others were intact controls. After 80 days she showed that the majority of the chipmunks killed by predators had lesions in their SCN. This gave evidence to support that having a mammalian circadian clock is a favorable trait that has been naturally selected for. In an outdoor enclosure, DeCoursey released white-tailed antelope ground squirrels which had various levels of SCN lesioned. The squirrels displaying the most activity during the night had the highest amount of lesioning. This research has helped further our understanding of sleep related issues affecting humans such as jet lag or insomnia. Current research Her current research focuses on the physiological and behavioral aspects of circadian rhythms, She has studied how the retina moves in response to the daily rhythm. Also, as mentioned above, her work on chipmunks has helped uncover the adaptive value of the circadian clock in the wild. She has done experiment related to the adaptive value of clocks on antelope squirrels and golden-mantled squirrels. This research furthers our understanding of sleep related issues affecting humans such as jet lag or insomnia. Other achievements DeCoursey received the 2011 South Carolina Environmental Awareness Award for re-foresting the W. Gordon Belser Arboretum at the University of South Carolina, a six-year initiative she led, as well as for various small gardens around the university. The arboretum is designated as an outdoor field classroom and laboratory for USC undergraduates, and it is also used for conducting a variety of educational outreach programs. According to an article in Scientific American, DeCoursey “spends half her work time on the restoring the arboretum and organizing class visits, and the other half on her professorial duties.” Decoursey also became a member of the original Organizing Committees for both the Journal of Biological Rhythms and the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms (SRBR). She has been an active member on the Advisory Board for both groups and served two terms as SRBR’’s Secretary. DeCoursey was one of the activists who worked to create what is now the Congaree National Park.

The battle ended up being an English victory in that prevented a Franco-Dutch invasion of Nevis. Background Early in 1667 the French having joined on the side of the Dutch decided to target England's Caribbean colonies. Having captured their half of St. Kitts, Antigua, and Montserrat they now threatened to invade Nevis. In March Captain John Berry, in the 56-gun man-of-war Coronation arrived at Barbados and the Governor decided to make an attempt to save Nevis. He bought up a number of armed merchantmen and created a squadron of ten men-of-war and one fireship under Berry's command. Having arrived at Nevis, Berry decided on blockading French held Saint Kitts on 17 April. On 14 May at Martinique French Admiral de La Barre, Martinique's governor Vice Admiral Robert de Clodoré and Guadeloupe's governor Rear Admiral Claude François du Lyon, plus the fireships were met by Crijnssen’s Dutch squadron who had reconquered Berbice and St Eustatius from the English. In a conference they decided on a combined attack against Nevis and were further strengthened by 600 volunteers raised on Martinique plus another 500 picked up two days later at Guadeloupe. On 18 May the combined force headed toward Nevis. Action On 20 May in the early morning rounding the southern points of Nevis, the Franco-Dutch fleet was sighted by English reconnaissance boats, who carried a warning into Charlestown. By 8 a.m. Captain Berry immediately prepared for action knowing that he was outnumbered and then waited for the attack with ten large men of war headed by Coronation of 50 guns, two frigates and 2 fireships.Jacques p.723 Meanwhile, the militia on Nevis itself lined the defenses in case the French and Dutch managed to get through; they also supported the fleet with a number of cannons. The French and Dutch fleet closed in on the English line and soon the battle commenced. The French line disintegrated into confusion while preparing to engage so De la Barre brought his flagship Lys Couronne of 38 guns into action with the Coronation but soon found himself surrounded by the English. After being badly mauled he and his ship barely managed to escape but the Dutch seeing the French collapse immediately tried to help. They came in and gave Coronation a severe pounding but they too were forced to withdraw in threat of English fireships. In the thick of the battle an English man of war took a hit in her powder magazine and blew up and sank with most of her crew, and a 30-gun French man of war and a smaller flyboat were destroyed by fireships. The French and the Dutch seeing that they could not get through realized the battle had been lost. The battle then ended with a desultory long-range exchange between both fleets, with the English fleet still holding its line, de La Barre with increasing casualties and his ship severely damaged then decided to withdraw off towards Saint Kitts by 2 p.m. compelling the Dutch under an angry Crijnssen to follow. Aftermath Disheartened at their poor showing, Crijnseen decided to part company with the French.Jacques p.723 On 27 May de La Barre’s fleet accompanied the Dutch as far as Saint Barthélemy and was soon chased toward Martinique by some of Berry’s ships. The English remained at Nevis and were not threatened for the rest of the war. As a result of the battle Franco-Dutch strategic collaboration in the Caribbean which could have promised so much all but ceased. To make matters worse for them Louis was not willing to commit more men and ships to the Caribbean. An English attempt to retake St. Kitts ended in failure but it would not matter as more English reinforcements arrived under Rear-Admiral Sir John Harman. They reached the West Indies in June and inflicted a heavy defeat on de la Barre at Martinique on 25 June which virtually vaporised the entire French fleet in the America's changing the situation and making sure the English had the upper hand in the Caribbean for the remainder of the war.

It connects the valley at 419 meters above sea level with the 1022 meter high mountain station near the Pfänderspitze. History Planning Design of the cog railway Originally, the establishment of a cog railway was considered, but it was eventually decided for cost and ease of use in times of heavy snow. Construction and opening The Pfänderbahn was built from July 1926 to February 1927 and opened on 20 March 1927 by President Michael Hainish. Construction work was undertaken by Adolf Bleichert & Co. of Leipzig. Plans for the station buildings were by Bregenz architect Willibald Braun. 1994 overhaul In October 1994, the cable car system was extensively overhauled: * Replacement of gondolas, they are now fully glazed and can accommodate up to 80 people. * Removal of two supports, providing a higher rope guide. * Installation of a hydraulic device for cable tension. * The stations are sliding platforms used to optimally utilize the available space. * A hydraulic system stabilized the gondola in the parking position so that getting in and out is very easy and accessible for wheelchair users. The renovations were undertaken by Doppelmayr. In 1998, the Pfänderbahn museum opened. Specifications The height difference of 603 meters is covered in a total distance of 2063 meters using a dual aerial tramway. The sloping portions comprises about 1980 meters; the horizontal portion about 80 meters. At an average slope of 31%, the cabins move with a speed of up to twelve feet per second. The journey takes six minutes, with a turnaround of 10 minutes. The gondolas are powered by two 500 kW DC electric motors. Power supply to the cable car is via two separate power supplies. In addition, an emergency generator and batteries are available. Communication between valley and mountain stations is analogous via the cable itself.

He uses a variety of materials, his work ranges from conceptual to portraiture and landscape. Socialist propaganda and western advertising, island culture and contemporary city life, are all aspects of his life that inform his work.  Early life and education  Rodriguez arrived in the United States during the Mariel boatlift crisis, 1980. Until the age of 9, Rodriguez lived in the Cuban countryside town of El Gabriel. In an interview conducted by Yuko Shimizu, Rodriguez described his earliest visual influences as military, revolutionary and nationalist imagery. In 1980 Rodriguez emigrated to the United States with his father, Cesareo Rodriguez mother, Coralia Rodriguez and sister Irma as one of the thousands of Cubans who took part in the Mariel boatlift. His family of four arrived in Key West and as the Cuban government had taken possession of the families home, car, furniture and even clothes, the Rodriguez family had little to start a new life with. The family moved in with relatives in Miami, Florida where Edel's father established a trucking business. Within a couple of years of arriving in the United States, Rodriguez had mastered the language to the point that he became a Spelling Bee champion. Rodriguez graduated from Hialeah-Miami Lakes High School in 1990. After graduation from High School, Rodriguez declined a full scholarship to The University of Miami and instead attended Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York. While a student at Pratt, Rodriguez interned at Spy magazine, MTV and Penguin Books. After graduating from Pratt with honors and earning a BFA on a full scholarship in painting. Rodriguez went on to earn a M.F.A. from Hunter College in 1998. In 1991, Rodriguez met Jennifer Roth;the two married in 1997.  Work  In 1994 Rodriguez began work as an art director for Time magazine. At 26, Rodriguez was the youngest art director to ever work on Time's Canadian and Latin American editions. He held this position until 2008, when he began dedicating all of his time to art and commercial illustration. While working at Time, Rodriguez produced a significant amount of illustration work, the majority of which was done in the evenings. Some of the more memorable commercial works produced during this period were his June 27, 2005 Time magazine cover for China's New Revolution in which Mao Zedong is depicted wearing Louis Vuitton and his May/June 2006 cover for Communication Arts depicting Che Guevara wearing a Nike logo and Apple headphones. The Time cover depicting Mao Zedong was later used in 2009 as the cover for Lürzer's 200 Best Illustrators Worldwide. Throughout his career, Rodriguez has utilized a variety of artistic media including paint, printmaking, pastel, line drawing as well as digital manipulation. Rodriguez' work has been published by magazines such as The New Yorker, Time, Rolling Stone, Fortune and others.

In 2005, the U.S. Postal Service released the Cha-Cha-Cha stamp, illustrated by Rodriguez.https://www.commarts.com/project/6203/cha-cha-cha-stamp Artistic approach Rodriguez believes that illustrations have the ability to influence and inspire people in a way that words can not, because they can tell a complicated story in a simple way. In the News For the 2015 February 8 issue of Newsweek, the cover story by Nina Burleigh was illustrated by Rodriguez. The cover image, portraying a woman with her skirt being lifted up by a computer cursor created controversy, with some calling it a faceless and sexualized symbol of women. The cover image also created what NBC News described as a \\"firestorm\\" on Twitter, after the website Jezebel derided the illustration. Others considered the cover image appropriate to the subject matter of the article. Burleigh, the author of the article on which the illustration was based described the critical comments as petty. On PBS, Rodriguez defended the work saying \\"it’s not sexist, it depicts the ugliness of sexism\\". For the 2016 August 22 issue of Time, editor-in-chief Nancy Gibbs focused their cover on Republican Donald Trump's presidential campaign, with the cover title Meltdown and DW Pine commissioned Rodriguez for the cover illustration. The cover appeared on various news broadcasts, including PBS and MSNBC, as well as generating news coverage in such magazines and newspapers as The Washington Post and People For the February 4, 2017 issue of Der Spiegel, Rodriguez's cover image depicting President Donald Trump holding the Statue of Liberty's severed head in one hand and a knife in the other, with the cover title America First generated news coverage in such publications as The Washington Post, The Guardian, Newsweek and other news outlets. The cover image was described as tasteless by vice-president of the European Parliament, Alexander Graf Lambsdorff and defended by Der Spiegel editor-in-chief Klaus Brinkbaeumer, who commented that he was surprised by the impact of the illustration. The August 28th, 2017 issue of Time Magazine, titled Hate in America focused on a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that resulted in the death of 2 police officers and a 32 year old women. Illustrated by Rodriguez , the cover art, depicting a protester giving a Nazi salute while draped in an American flag was covered in the news by CNN and Market Watch as well as other media outlets.

About 1645 or 1646, the Bowne family moved to Gravesend, an English settlement in New Netherland. He became a mariner by profession, and by 1680 was a resident of New York City, where he became a merchant. In 1686 he became a resident of Middletown Township, New Jersey,Historical and Genealogical Miscellany, John E. Stillwell, M. D., Vol. III; New York, 1914, p. 38 where he purchased 1,000 acres from Samuel Winder on June 17. Winder was a son in law of Thomas Rudyard, to whom the land had been originally granted. This land is now Cliffwood and Cliffwood Beach in Aberdeen Township; it was here that Bowne lived until his death. Political career New York On October 10, 1683, after having served there as a juror the month before, Andrew Bowne was appointed by Governor Thomas Dongan as a judge of the Admiralty Court. On November 3, 1684, he was commissioned as an Alderman of New York City, and again on October 16, 1685.Historical and Genealogical Miscellany, John E. Stillwell, M.

In 1692 he was appointed a judge of the Court of Session, and was Presiding Judge in 1693, 1697, 1698 and 1699. In 1698 and 1699 Bowne was a judge of the East Jersey Court of Common Right, the supreme court of the colony.Historical and Genealogical Miscellany, John E. Stillwell, M. D., Vol. III; New York, 1914, p. 38 In 1692 Andrew Bowne was appointed a member of the East New Jersey Provincial Council, the upper house of the legislature.\\"Manual of the Legislature of New Jersey\\", date: various (pre 1950) He remained of the Council through the first administration of Governor Andrew Hamilton and that of Gov. Jeremiah Basse. On May 9, 1699, Basse proposed to the Council the need for a deputy governor to act during his absence in London; the Council appointed Andrew Bowne to the position; he took the oath of allegiance and official oath on May 15.New Jersey Colonial Documents, Archives of the State of New Jersey, First Series, Vol. II; Daily Advertiser Publishing House, Newark, New Jersey, 1881. pp. 266-267 On August 19, Hamilton was reappointed as governor, succeeding Basse. Hamilton arrived in December 1699, superseding Bowne. The political rivalry between Bowne and Hamilton did not end here, for on June 17, 1701, Bowne came before the Council with a commission dated March 25 and signed by six East Jersey Proprietors living in England appointing him as Governor of East New Jersey. The Proprietors residing in East Jersey were called before the Council and questioned the validity of Bowne's commission, as it had been signed by a minority of Proprietors in England, and presented a protest against it. While Bowne was resolved to publish his commission, Hamilton refused to surrender the governor's office, stating that to do so would leave the province without government, as Bowne's commission was defective rendering him unqualified to take over the office. The following day the Council ordered \\"that Proclamations be Issued out to Acquaint the People of Capt. Bownes Defective Commission, that no body pay Obedience thereto\\", signed by Gov. Hamilton under the seal of the province. The Council further ordered that a letter be written to the Proprietors in England advising them of the Council's reasons in advising Hamilton not to surrender the government, stating that in their opinion, \\"the only use Intended to be made of this commission was to Supersede (Colonel) Hamiltons And then to throw up the Other and thereby to Lodge the Government in the People\\".New Jersey Colonial Documents, Archives of the State of New Jersey, First Series, Vol. II; Daily Advertiser Publishing House, Newark, New Jersey, 1881. p. 385 Province of New Jersey After the late 1690s the government of East and West Jersey became increasingly dysfunctional, of which the controversies involving Andrew Bowne were only a symptom. This ultimately resulted in the surrender by the Proprietors of East Jersey and those of West Jersey of the right of government to Queen Anne. Anne's government united the two colonies as the Province of New Jersey, a royal colony, establishing a new system of government. This reorganization and the period leading up to it saw many New Jersey politicians jockeying for power and influence in the new government. Bowne and his supporters were no exception, as were his opponents. A 1701 petition to The Lords Commissioners of Trade and Foreign Plantations, signed by Lewis Morris and others, purporting to be \\"the Greatest part of ye Proprietors of the Provinces of East and West Jersie\\", recommended the appointment of Andrew Hamilton as Governor of New Jersey, at the same time cautioning against the appointment of Andrew Bowne to the office.New Jersey Colonial Documents, Archives of the State of New Jersey, First Series, Vol. II; Daily Advertiser Publishing House, Newark, New Jersey, 1881. pp. 415-416 A proposal by Sir Thomas Lane and other West Jersey proprietors, however, recommended Bowne for a seat in the proposed New Jersey Provincial Council. A proposal by East Jersey Proprietors William Dockwra, Thomas Barker, Clement Plumstead and Peter Sonmans recommended Bowne or Richard Ingoldesby for governor; if Ingoldesby was the choice then they recommended Bowne for a Council seat (It is notable that these were four of the six who had signed the defective commission as governor).New Jersey Colonial Documents, Archives of the State of New Jersey, First Series, Vol. II; Daily Advertiser Publishing House, Newark, New Jersey, 1881. pp. 429-431 In spite of the political wrangling in New Jersey, London determined that its interests would best be served by a governor with no previous connections to any of the political factions; in late 1702 Queen Anne appointed her cousin, Viscount Cornbury to the governorship. Andrew Bowne was seated in the Council as a member from the Eastern Division.New Jersey Colonial Documents, Archives of the State of New Jersey, First Series, Vol. II; Daily Advertiser Publishing House, Newark, New Jersey, 1881. p. 507 With the suspension of President Lewis Morris from Council in 1704, Bowne became President.\\"Manual of the Legislature of New Jersey\\", date: various (pre 1950) Governor Cornbury appointed Andrew Bowne a judge of the Inferior Court of Common Pleas on December 11, 1704, and on November 6, 1705, elevated him to the New Jersey Supreme Court.Historical and Genealogical Miscellany, John E. Stillwell, M. D., Vol. III; New York, 1914, p. 38 In spite of these appointments, Cornbury expressed concern about the health of Bowne and others and their ability to serve in Council to the Lords of Trade in 1703 and 1706.Historical and Genealogical Miscellany, John E. Stillwell, M. D., Vol. III; New York, 1914, p. 40 By 1708, Captain Andrew Bowne was dead.New Jersey Colonial Documents, Archives of the State of New Jersey, First Series, Vol. III; Daily Advertiser Publishing House, Newark, New Jersey, 1881. pp. 340 Personal life Andrew Bowne had five brothers, John, James, Philip and Gershom, and one sister, who married a Mr. Mott. John and James both served in the East Jersey General Assembly, with John serving as Speaker from 1680 to 1683. He was married to Elizabeth; they had one daughter, also named Elizabeth.

The trio consisted of Gonzalo Rubalcaba on piano, bassist Carlos Henriguez, and drummer Ignacio Berroa. It peaked at number 25 in the Billboard Top Jazz Albums chart. Produced by Rubalcaba, the album was released following his collaborative work with Charlie Haden on the album Nocturne, which resulted in a Grammy Award for Haden. Supernova includes nine tracks and met with mostly positive reviews by critics, most commenting on the versatility and musical ability of the performer. The album was further nominated for a Grammy, a Billboard Latin Music Award, and earned the Latin Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Album. Background and release Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba recorded Supernova following his collaboration with Charlie Haden on the album Nocturne, which was co-produced, performed and orchestrated by Rubalcaba. The pianist was named the \\"most visible musical presence\\" in Nocturne and the album received the Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Album at the 44th Grammy Awards, after being referred to as an \\"engaging blend of jazz and Latin song\\" by Don Heckman of Los Angeles Times. About Supernova, Rubalcaba stated that blends the melodic tone of his previous album (Inner Voyage) and the lyricism of his early records. In May 2001, three months before the album release, Rubalcaba along with bassist Carlos Henriquez and drummer Ignacio Berroa (The Gonzalo Rubalcaba Trio), debuted some of the tracks at the Catalina Jazz Club in Los Angeles, California, without telling his audience beforehand. Heckman described the songs as \\"pieces roved through unusual metric territory, with explosive accents bursting out of the rhythmic flow.\\" The album was released by Blue Note Records on July 17, 2001, becoming Rubalcaba's seventh album for the label. Content The album includes nine tracks, five original songs and four covers. The title track is separated in two takes, \\"Supernova 1\\" and \\"Supernova 2\\". The first one shifts constantly the time signature becoming a \\"stop-and-start\\" mambo. Matt Cibula of PopMatters highlights the work of Berroa on the drums and Henriquez' bass, giving both pieces a \\"solid foundation\\". The second track, \\"El Cadete Constitucional\\", was written by Jacobo Rubalcaba (the pianist grandfather), as a children's song and adapted into a funky strut in its step, opening as a \\"throwback to early Cuban jazz\\", and ending with a very \\"modern\\" synthesizer solo. The song features additional percussion by Robert and Luis Quintero. \\"El Manicero\\", an American standard since 1930, also has and additional participation by the Quintero brothers. \\"Alma Mia\\" is a ballad, considered a Mexican standard on which the trio applies \\"honest melancholy lyricism.\\" \\"The Hard One\\" is a re-recording of the original take included on Rubalcaba's Inner Voyage (1999). The track samples \\"Take Five\\" by Dave Brubeck, and features Rubalcaba's piano rumbling in \\"metrical unpredictability.\\" \\"La Voz del Centro\\" is a waltz. The last song, \\"Oren\\", it is an \\"environmental piece\\" with drums and piano, deemed as \\"pretty but trivial\\". Reception and accolades Supernova received positive reviews from critics. Bret Love of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 stars out of five, calling it \\"a wonderful album of varying moods and textures.\\" Leila Cobo of Billboard magazine named the album an \\"accomplished work that highlights a more introspective and versatile Rubalcaba.\\" On the album review, Cobo also commented that \\"this [Supernova] is a refreshing outing.\\" All About Jazz' Mark Corroto stated that the album proves that the performer \\"has plenty of heart rooted in a traditional Cuban music past and a head pointed into a diverse North American future.\\" Matt Cibula of PopMatters stated that Supernova is a \\"wonderful record, that proves that Rubalcaba is one of the greatest composers and pianist in the world,\\" but was critical about the lack of emotional commitment to his music, concluding that the album would work better on an audience that never heard the performer before. Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ grade, arguing that it \\"neatly showcases Rubalcaba's strengths: unerring yet playful rhythm, technical ferocity when required, burnished balladry, and Cuban swagger blended with jazz suavity.\\" George Tysh of Metro Times stated that Supernova \\"incorporates both Rubalcaba personalities, being more percussively rhythmic (definitely more Latin) than Inner Voyage, but still as sensitive.\\" Jazz Review granted the album a perfect score of five stars, with Don Williamson stating that the album \\"continues to prove that Rubalcaba is dedicated to the authenticity, the tradition and the spirit of the Cuban music he studied and which is part of his being.\\" The Rubalcaba's biography included on the book Jazz for Dummies (2006) by Dick Sutro, emphasizes that the album founds the performer on his peak form. Rubalcaba received a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Album in 2002 for Supernova, which was awarded to Haden's Nocturne. Both albums were nominated the following year to the Latin Grammy Award in the same field. According to musician David Sánchez, the award was Rubalcaba's to lose since Haden was not Latino. Supernova earned the Latin Grammy. The track \\"Oren\\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition, which it lost to Alan Silvestri's \\"Cast Away (End Credits)\\". Supernova reached number two at the CMJ Jazz Albums chart and peaked at number 25 in the Billboard Top Jazz Albums chart and was nominated for \\"Latin Jazz Album of the Year\\" at the 13th Annual Billboard Latin Music Awards, losing to Latin Spirits by Poncho Sanchez.

Early life Isham was born on 20 July 1687 to Sir Justinian Isham, 4th Baronet of Lamport, Northamptonshire and his wife Elizabeth Turnor. After the Tory victory at the 1710 British general election, he was given a place as Commissioner of leather duties and land taxes worth £500 a year in 1711, which he lost when the Whigs returned to power in 1714. In 1719 he went to Italy while the Pretender was there and received letters from his father warning him to take care how he behaved because there were court spies there. He married Mary Hacket, daughter of Lisle Hacket of Moxhull, Warwickshire on 11 September 1725. On the death of his father on 13 May 1730, he became Baronet of Lamport and inherited the family manor house of Lamport Hall.

The only known species Spetaea lachenaliiflora is found only in the south-west of the Cape Province in South Africa. Prior to 2003, it was incorrectly known as Scilla plumbea. Description Spetaea lachenaliiflora grows from underground bulbs which have a leathery dark brown outer tunic. The linear leaves are produced at the same time as the flowers; they are smooth, green and fleshy. The flowers are borne on an upright stem (peduncle) in a many-flowered raceme which forms a narrow cylindrical shape. Individual flowers have six bright blue tepals which are joined at the base for about two thirds of their length producing a narrow bell shape. The tepals persist into the fruiting stage. The stamens have filaments joined to each other at the base and to the base of the tepals. The ovoid seeds are black. They have a prominent whitish hilum which distinguishes the species from related genera. Spetaea lachenaliiflora is found only in the west of Cape Province, South Africa, where it is found in moist areas and along streams in the Bains Kloof and Du Toits Kloof Mountains. Systematics The genus and species were named by Wolfgang Wetschnig and Martin Pfosser in 2003. Previously, the species was mistakenly called Scilla plumbea, correctly the name for a different plant now called Merwilla plumbea. The generic name honours Franz Speta, an Austrian botanist specializing in the Scilloideae who first drew Wetchnig and Pfosser's attention to the difference between this species and the true Scilla plumbea. The specific epithet indicates the similarity in the overall appearance of the flowers to those of the genus Lachenalia. Spetaea is placed in the tribe Hyacintheae (or subfamily Hyacinthoideae by those who accept the family Hyacinthaceae). Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that it is close to the genus Daubenya.

Biography Lamport Hall, Isham, Norfolk Edmund Isham was born on 18 December 1690 to Sir Justinian Isham, 4th Baronet of Lamport, Northamptonshire and his wife Elizabeth Turnor. He was educated at Rugby School and Wadham College, Oxford and embarked on a legal career, becoming an advocate in Doctors' Commons (1724) and a judge advocate in the Court of Admiralty (1731–41). He unexpectedly became Baronet of Lamport on 5 March 1737 when his older brother Justinian III died young. He was easily elected a few days later on 31 March 1737 to his brother's seat in Parliament as the Tory Member of Parliament for Northamptonshire, and ran unopposed each successive term after that for the rest of his life. He also inherited the family seat of Lamport Hall. He died on 15 December 1772. Although he had married twice he left no children and was therefore succeeded as baronet by his nephew Justinian Isham, the son of his younger brother, the Reverend Euseby Isham.
