WXDC is owned Metro Radio, Inc. and operated by West Virginia Radio Corporation. West Virginia Media Corporation began operating WXDC and sister-station WCST on May 1, 2019, as they begin the process of buying the two stations from Metro Radio, Inc. History The station came on the air as WCST-FM in 1965, but later changed to WDHC with the \\"Down Home County\\" branding in 1996. WDHC was originally on 93.5 FM and moved to 92.9 FM in 2005 with a taller tower and twice the original size and double the original power of 93.5. WXDC's distant grade signal can be heard in Winchester, Virginia, Hagerstown, Maryland and Martinsburg, West Virginia. In April 2009, WDHC DJ Travis Lee, 27, known on the air as \\"Mr. T\\", was killed by a train while camping with friends in Morgan County, West Virginia. In 2011, WDHC switched their branding from \\"Down Home Country\\" to \\"Country 92-9\\" and to a more mainstream Country format, as well as updating their website. In March 2014, WDHC dropped its longtime Country format for a hybrid Classic Hits/Classic Top 40 format as \\"Max 92-9\\". In January 2017, WDHC was sold to Metro Radio of Fairfax, Virginia, who owns WTNT in the Washington market. The purchase was consummated on March 1, 2017, at a price of $365,000. Metro fired the entire staff, changed the callsign to WXDC, and began simulcasting WTNT's Spanish- language programming on March 8. Due to community backlash, Metro Radio entered into a local marketing agreement with Hancock, Maryland restaurant owner Diane Smith, who flipped the station back to English-language classic hits \\"Max 92-9\\" on May 1. On January 1, 2018, WXDC changed to oldies from classic hits. On May 1, 2019, West Virginia Radio Corporation began operating WXDC and sister station WCST as it began the process of buying the stations from Metro Radio. The local marketing agreement with Diane Smith ended on April 30, 2019. At 9:00am, on May 1, 2019 WXDC relaunched their Oldies format as \\"Cool 92.9\\". On October 11, 2019, WXDC shifted back from Oldies to Classic Hits. On March 1, 2020, WXDC changed formats from Classic Hits back to their longtime Country music format.

It was broadcast on BBC2 on 4 August 2004 and was also screened at several LGBT film festivals in 2005 and 2006. Plot Jim (Alun Armstrong) is a Latin teacher who is retiring after a long career at the same public school he attended as a boy. He has led a sheltered and lonely life and is determined to see the world and fall in love. His plans are delayed when his father (David Morris) has a stroke. The cab that picks Jim up from school is driven by Ray (Paul Freeman), a widower whose grown children, Caz (Tamzin Outhwaite) and Little Ray (Jason Flemyng), use him as an unpaid babysitter for their kids. Ray also feels lonely and unfulfilled, and the terminal illness of his friend Billy (Karl Johnson) has made him face his own mortality. He is inspired to take charge of his own life after learning of Jim's plans. Despite their different backgrounds, shy academic Jim and former football hooligan Ray become friends. Although Jim is sexually inexperienced and Ray has lived a lifetime as a heterosexual, their friendship eventually develops into a romantic relationship. The situation is further complicated by the reactions of Ray's children.

Dorr (September 11, 1939 ‚Äì June 12, 2016) was an American author and retired senior diplomat who wrote and published over 70 books, hundreds of short stories, and numerous contemporary non-fiction articles on international affairs, military issues, and the Vietnam War. Most recently, he headed the weekly \\"Back Talk\\" opinion column for the Military Times newspaper and the monthly \\"Washington Watch\\" feature of Aerospace America. He is also on the Masthead as the technical editor of Air Power History, the journal of the Air Force Historical Foundation, and was Washington correspondent for the discontinued World Air Power Journal. He has appeared as an expert on numerous CNN, History News Network, C-SPAN, and other national and cable television programs. Early life Dorr was born in Washington, DC on September 11, 1939 to government workers Blanche Boisvert and Lawrence Gerald Dorr of 2800 - 33rd Street, Washington, DC. In 1947, Dorr moved with his family to the nearby Maryland suburbs where he would graduate from high school. A humorous 2017 article featured on Gizmodo uncovered that at 14 years old, Dorr wrote letters to Boeing and other companies requesting photos of certain planes. As the planes were classified at the time, the FBI opened multiple espionage investigations but ultimately concluded he was a \\"loyal American boy.\\" After high school, Dorr joined the U.S. Air Force in 1957, and served in Korea. Upon leaving the Air Force in 1960, Dorr moved to San Francisco to attend the University of California, Berkeley.https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/robert-f-dorr-author- of-military-histories-dies- at-76/2016/07/03/c2c2371c-3e3d-11e6-84e8-1580c7db5275_story.html His writing career in Men's adventure magazines began around this time. In 1964, Dorr became a Foreign Service Officer with the U.S. Department of State, where he was assigned as a US diplomat and political officer to U.S. Embassies and Consulates in Madagascar, South Korea, Japan, Liberia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Dorr was fluent in French, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Swedish, and German, and retired as a Senior Foreign Service officer in 1990. He devoted the rest of his life to writing. Career Dorr spent 25 years as a Senior Foreign Service Officer (1964‚Äì89) with the U.S. State Department. He held senior positions in Washington after tours of duty in Tananarive, Madagascar; Seoul, Korea; Fukuoka, Japan; Monrovia, Liberia; Stockholm, Sweden; and London, England. He married his wife, a South Korean national, in 1968 in a ceremony that was held at the home of his Foreign Service mentor, Ambassador William J. Porter. Dorr published his first magazine article in 1955 (age 16) and is best known for his magazine and newspaper work. In 1960, fresh out of the Air Force, Dorr moved to San Francisco to attend the University of California, Berkeley, staying at the famed Baker's Acres boarding house for much of the period 1960-1964 with several lifelong friends, including: future Air Force Colonel Larry Harry; future colleague and CIA Officer Dick Ristaino; and others. It was during this time that Dorr began to publish what would become thousands of fictional action stories for numerous men's adventure and pulp magazines, something Dorr continued to do quietly on the side even after his appointment as a Foreign Service Officer in 1964. Dorr's many contributions to this genre were only very recently resurfaced in \\"A Handful of Hell - Classic War and Adventure Stories by Robert F. Dorr\\" edited by Robert Deis and Wyatt Doyle (2016), as well as the compendium: \\"Weasels Ripped My Flesh!\\" (2012). In 1978, he received a non-fiction award from the now- defunct Aviation/Space Writers Association. He regularly contributed articles to Air Forces Monthly, Air International, Combat Aircraft, Aerospace America magazine, the journal of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), Air & Space/Smithsonian, and Flight Journal. Dorr was heavily engaged in writing for London-based Aerospace Publishing - initially for its partwork magazines and latterly for its prestigious quarterlies, including World Air Power Journal. Dorr's weekly opinion column in the trade journal Military Times was read by about 100,000 current, former, and retired military members and their families. Dorr's opinion columns combined strong support for the military with a liberal political point of view. In a September 10, 2007 column that was widely reprinted around the United States, he called for an end to the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and for treating war prisoners openly under the 1949 Geneva Convention. Before U.S. law changed to permit it, Dorr called for the military to allow homosexuals to serve openly. In other columns, he has urged veterans service organizations to get up to date to attract younger veterans and has written about what he calls the dismantling of the Air Force in an era of tight budgets. Dorr was an observer of events in North Korea. Service academies, universities, and Veteran's groups have used his speeches and writings on foreign affairs and Air Force history. Dorr has been interviewed on several networks, including C-SPAN, the Discovery Channel, CNN, and local Washington-area newscasts. In 2010, he was given an Achievement Award by the Air Force Historical Foundation for his work for the foundation and its magazine, Air Power History. Latest projects Fighting Hitler's Jets was published in 2013 and describes Nazi Germany's introduction of jet and rocket-powered aircraft into the aerial battlefields of World War II. The book also discusses the actions taken by the Allies to counter these advanced aircraft. Dorr's book Mission to Tokyo about B-29 Superfortress crews in the war against Japan was published September 4, 2012. Focused in part on the firebomb mission to the Japanese capital on the night of March 9‚Äì10, 1945, the book is based on interviews with crewmembers. Readers encounter characters as disparate as the gruff, cigar-smoking Gen. Curtis LeMay and the author and artist Yoko Ono. Walter J. Boyne wrote in a review: \\"Mission to Tokyo is yet another incredible solo example of Bob's prolific scholarship and dedication to the art of writing aviation history.\\"* Dorr's book Mission to Berlin, about the Eighth Air Force raid of February 3, 1945 over Europe in World War II, was published May 1, 2011. This is primarily a history of B-17 Flying Fortress crews in one of the largest air battles of the war but it also covers Americans who flew and maintained the B-24 Liberator, P-47 Thunderbolt, and P-51 Mustang.http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/book-review-mission-to- berlin-the-american-airmen-who-struck-the-heart-of-hitler's-reich/ Dorr and former astronaut Tom Jones published in 2008 a wartime history of the 365th Fighter Group, Hell Hawks. This is a history of an aerial band of brothers who went ashore at Normandy just after the June 6, 1944 D-Day invasion, fought on the continent through the Battle of the Bulge, and were still in action when Germany surrendered. These American airmen lived under crude conditions, and were subject to harsh weather and frequent enemy attacks as they moved from one airbase to another, accompanying the Allied advance toward Germany. To tell their story, Dorr and Jones interviewed 183 surviving veterans who supported, maintained, and piloted the group's P-47 Thunderbolt fighters. Hell Hawks is in its ninth printing with almost 30,000 copies in print. Referring to Hell Hawks, Walter J. Boyne, former director of the National Air and Space Museum and member of the National Aviation Hall of Fame, wrote, \\"Hell Hawks sets a new standard for histories of the tactical air war in Europe. Veteran authors Bob Dorr and Tom Jones combine masterfully crafted veteran interviews with the broader picture of the air war fought by the Thunderbolt men.\\" The Experimental Aircraft Association's Warbirds magazine (July 2008) wrote, \\"Hell Hawks is a Stephen Ambrose-style history of a 'band of brothers' with airplanes.\\" Dorr published the science fiction novel Hitler's Time Machine in January 2015. The story concerns competing groups of American and German scientists trying to perfect a working time machine in order to influence the outcome of World War II.

She served in the Union Navy during the American Civil War until her loss in 1865. Construction, acquisition, and commissioning During the later stages of the Taiping Rebellion, Shanghai local authorities contracted Henry Gamaliel Ward, brother of American mercenary Frederick Townsend Ward who had died in combat fighting for the Qing Dynasty earlier, to purchase 5 steamers. Henry Ward ordered the constructions of 3 steamers, one of them being Dai Ching (), the other two being Kiang Soo (later USS Fuchsia) and Chih Kiang (later USS Tulip). Instead of delivering the steamers to China, Ward re-sold them to the Union Navy.* The U.S. Navy purchased her for $117,575 USD on 21 April 1863 for Civil War service. Outfitted as a gunboat at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York, and she was commissioned on 11 June 1863 with Lieutenant Commander J. C. Chaplin in command. Service history Dai Ching joined in the search for the Confederate States Navy raider CSS Tacony in the North Atlantic Ocean off the northeastern coast of the United States between 14 and 20 June 1863. After putting into Norfolk, Virginia, for coal and engine repairs, she arrived off Charleston, South Carolina, on 23 July and the following day joined other vessels of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron in the attack on Fort Wagner. On 25 July 1863 and again on 13‚Äì14 August 1863 she participated in assaults on Forts Wagner and Sumter, followed by a series of assaults on the other Confederate fortifications in Charleston Harbor between 17 and 22 August 1863. She also took part n the Union blockade of the Confederate States of America, and on 14 November 1863 she captured the schooner George Chisholm, a blockade runner with a cargo of salt, off the Santee River in South Carolina. Dai Ching joined an expedition up the St. Johns River in Florida, and she remained in that area from 6 February to 7 March 1864. She then returned to patrolling off the South Carolina coast and in January 1865 patrolled in the Combahee River. She captured the schooner Coquette, loaded with cotton, on 26 January 1865. Later that same day, Dai Ching came under fire by a three-gun Confederate artillery battery while she was on the Combahee River headed for Tar Bluff. Her pilot left the wheel and went below when the shelling started, and she ran aground. As the tide fell, the vessel settled so only her 100-pounder (45.4-kg) Parrott rifle could return Ô¨Åre. The armed tug attempted to pull her off, but the tow line parted, and Clover was unable to offer further assistance. The Parrott rifle was knocked out at 3:00 p.m. After seven hours of shelling, during which Dai Ching had taken thirty hits by shell and shot, with her guns disabled and machinery wrecked, her crew set her afire to prevent her capture by the Confederates and abandoned ship. Her crew escaped aboard Clover except for five who were absent from the ship on duty and who were later captured by the Confederates.Gaines, W. Craig, Encyclopedia of Civil War Shipwrecks, Louisiana State University Press, 2008, , pp. 144-145. The U.S. Navy removed the wreck of Dai Ching in 1906. A marsh island named Gunboat Island later formed in the river at the wreck site.

The college had been a high school for students in grades 8 to 12, but was closed at the end of 2008. Some of the school buildings were heritage-listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 2008. Grounds and campus There is a monastery (now the ‚ÄúBrothers House‚Äù) located at 56 Fernberg Road which was built in 1929 (architect: George Frederick Addison). The building is rectangular in plan with a continuous veranda integrated into unconventional orders supporting the veranda roof over two- storeys. Capitalising on the sloping terrain of the site, this large masonry structure is elevated from street level so as to emphasise grandeur. A low, retaining wall edges the property to the street. The Brothers House The main college is located at 58 Fernberg Road and was built in 1949 (architect: Frank L. Cullen). The college building is a three-storey brick construction, containing 9 classrooms and an attached undercroft recreational area. The classrooms are accessed by an internal wooden staircase and long hallways. The High School Additional college buildings surrounding the main structure include science laboratories, a library, workshops and a swimming pool. The college grounds are terraced from the Fernberg Road level down to Beck Street; this area includes playgrounds, cricket nets and tennis courts. Another wing of the college is located across the road at 61 Fernberg Road having been built in 1971. This is a long, two-level building with eight classrooms and facilities including an art room, a playground and covered area. The High School The school's sports fields, called \\"Lavalla\\", are located at Fig Tree Pocket some west from the school. The fields cover and have 4 playing fields and other facilities. The current school site (and the Brothers‚Äô Monastery) are owned, in principle, by the Corporation of the Trustees of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane (beneficially for the local parish) and zoned by the Brisbane City Council for community and education purposes. The school is presently administered by Brisbane Catholic Education and supported by the Marist Brothers (who currently supply a principal and two members of staff). The playing fields at Fig Tree Pocket are owned in trust by the Marist Brothers for the Rosalie college. The Catholic Church often created ownership of land and buildings on trust for the local parish in part in recognition of the fact that the parish and the community supplied money, time and labour to create the facilities. At Marist Rosalie College the Marist Brothers administered and taught at the school until 1970 when Catholic Education Brisbane took over the administration. Despite the fact that Catholic Education Brisbane and the Marist Brothers do not own the school or land they are influential in the direction the school takes, as is, traditionally, the Parish priest, who acts as a voice for the local Catholic community. Adjacent to the school are a number of Catholic buildings still owned by the Parish. At 369 Given Terrace stands the large red brick Sacred Heart Church, built in 1917. Immediately across the road at 333 Given Terrace is the \\"Sacred Heart Primary School\\" (consisting of 5 small buildings) for grades 1‚Äì7, now closed but used by other Catholic groups. Behind that is a brick community hall constructed in 1978. There is also a parish priest residence on Given Terrace and a smaller building on the corner of Fernberg Road and Given Terrace that stands where the parish‚Äôs original wooden church stood. The original wooden church was constructed and formally blessed by Archbishop Robert Dunne on 10 March 1907 and was used until the large brick church was built in 1917, and thereafter it was used for primary school schooling until it burnt down in the 1970s. Finally at 327 Given Terrace there is the Sacred Heart Convent built in 1918 which was owned and used by the Sisters of Mercy order of nuns (who had commenced teaching in the parish in 1905) until sold by them in 2005. All of these premises have been utilised by the Marist Brothers High School when the need arises. Sacred Heart Church with Marist Brothers Rosalie in the background The Sacred Heart Convent \\"old\\" building, with former Sisters of Mercy residence in background Location and demographics Marist Brothers Rosalie is located in the area known as Rosalie, which is a small locality within Paddington, an inner western suburb of the city of Brisbane. The ground in that locality is full of slopes and hills with the high points being held by the Catholic Church or the Queensland Government. Marist College Rosalie is geographically placed at the centre of the suburbs of Paddington, Milton, Bardon, Red Hill and Petrie Terrace. These suburbs were traditionally working- class mainly made of old Anglo-Irish Catholic Australians, indigenous aboriginal people and new waves of Catholics migrants. The first Catholic migrants were the Irish, then the Italians, Croatians and Polish came in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s and then more recently smaller groups of Islander, South American and South East Asian families. The high proportion of Catholics in the area during those years is attested to by the fact that there are seven Catholic churches, four primary Catholic schools (one defunct), two girls high schools, and various halls and refectories all within a five-mile (8 km) radius of Marist Brothers Rosalie. These ‚Äúnew‚Äù communities were both fortified and nurtured by the local churches and their schools and many families made financial sacrifices to support these institutions. Today the sons of immigrant families are a continuing presence at Marist College Rosalie, reflecting the multicultural population of Brisbane and the mix of Australian- Irish, Anglo-Irish, European, Asian and Latin at the school reflects the Catholic Church in a microcosm. Traditionally the school drew from this local population for its students, however, since the 1960s and especially since the gentrification of the Paddington area in the 1980s and 1990s with young professionals, the school has drawn mainly from Catholic families on the western train line, and to a lesser extent from the northern suburbs of Kelvin Grove, Ashgrove, The Gap, Herston, Normanby and Windsor. The suburbs traversed by the western line run from the now gentrified formerly working-class inner west, through the middle-class western suburbs to the now largely working- class outer western suburbs. This western train line runs from central Brisbane to the city of Ipswich some away, through the adjoining suburb of Milton which links and binds the western suburbs of Brisbane. The train line passes through the suburbs of Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, Indooroopilly, Chelmer, Graceville, Sherwood, Corinda, Oxley, Darra, Wacol and onto Ipswich. The train line at Indooroopilly also links with buses from the non-train accessible western suburbs of Kenmore, Chapel Hill, Pinjarra Hills, Pullevale, Brookfield, Mt Ommaney, Jindalee, and Riverhills who also access the major Western Freeway for motorcars which exits onto Milton Road at Toowong before passing through Milton onto the city heart. Accordingly, Marist Brothers Rosalie is well-positioned to attract students from the western suburbs and is, in fact, the only Catholic high school for boys in the western suburbs of Brisbane between the city of Brisbane and the city of Ipswich. The only other non-State run high schools in the western suburbs that take boys are Brisbane Boys College (Protestant) and St Peter‚Äôs (co-ed Lutheran). Today the western ‚Äútrain line‚Äù students make up some 70% of the school's population. Recent Queensland Government demographics (2007) however suggest that although the local children attending Rosalie dropped off as the area went through a process of gentrification, and became an area for young people and singles, the area now is once again becoming a family area as those ‚Äúyoung people and singles‚Äù marry and have children. Accordingly, those demographics have indicated that there is a mini \\"baby boom\\" locally, which the school can draw from. History Marist Brothers Rosalie represents an enduring example of the history of Catholic Education in Queensland, and stands as a testament to the influence and foresight of the great Catholic ‚Äúarchitect‚Äù and ‚Äúbuilder‚Äù of Brisbane, Archbishop James Duhig. In 1912 Archbishop Duhig was made adjudicator of Brisbane and then Archbishop of Brisbane in 1917. He instigated a period of great expansion in the Catholic Church resulting in the building and rebuilding of churches, schools and convents that lasted well into until the 1940s. What makes the Archbishop‚Äôs vision even more impressive is that the expansion occurred during the financially difficult time of the Great Depression and during uncertain times of World War One and World War Two when young men were at war and construction material and labour was difficult to obtain. The hills across Brisbane are dotted with Catholic education buildings built on land purchased by the Archbishop during this period as part of his vision for the future. As Archbishop of Brisbane for fifty years, he oversaw the construction of more than four hundred major church buildings. At the same time as Duhig's \\"construction\\" the Marist order was invited (although the Marists taught at as far back as 1919 in the Rosalie parish), as were the Brigidine Sisters, Christian Brothers, and Josephite nuns to educate the Catholic families of Brisbane in these new buildings, and they became an integral part of Queensland's religious cultural history. In line with Archbishop Duhig‚Äôs vision the Rosalie monastery was the Marist Order's first house in Queensland and the foundation stone of the Marist Brothers' Monastery was officially laid on 29 July 1928 by His Excellency B. Catteneo. The construction was completed and ready for the new school year and was officially opened on 20 February 1929 by Archbishop Duhig. One hundred and thirty-five students were enrolled, a large number coming from the Convent School at Rosalie. The monastery was also used as a boarding residence until 1940. Those responsible for the design of the monastery were George Frederick Addison, son of prominent architect George Henry Male Addison, and G. F. Macdonald. After his father's death in 1922, the majority of Addison's work would be residential. He designed over thirty homes before his retirement in 1938. In designing the Marist Brothers Monastery, G.F. Addison was continuing a family connection with the Catholic Church as his father's last commission had been the neighbouring church of the Sacred Heart at Rosalie in 1918. G.H.M. Addison designed several other ecclesiastical buildings for the Catholic Church including: the Coorparoo Presbytery (1914); St. Columba's Church, Wilston (1915); St. Benedict's Church, East Brisbane (1917) and the Church of the Little Flower, Kedron (1924). This site stands as a purpose- built, landmark religious structure in Brisbane's Catholic Archdiocese. Its aesthetic significance and association with Brisbane architect, George Frederick Addison, who was continuing the connection of his father, G.H.M. Addison, to the Catholic Church, is a legacy that has been recognised in need of protection and preservation by the Queensland government \\"heritage listing\\" process. Eventually, modern school buildings were constructed, and the Monastery became primarily a residence for the teaching brothers of Marist College, Rosalie. It continues in this function today, as well as being a meeting place for parents and students of the College. It is a landmark structure in Rosalie's residential and Catholic precinct. Marist Brothers Rosalie took some boarders during the 1930s but this ceased with the opening of Marist College Ashgrove in 1940. By 1939 the Marist College Rosalie roll was four hundred and fifty-one students. It was clear that a new college was necessary. Again under the guiding hand and vision of Archbishop Duhig plans were put in place for a new school building. The present senior college was officially blessed and opened by Archbishop Duhig on 2 October 1949 at a cost of 35,000 pounds. A crowd of nearly two thousand people attended the opening including the Labor Premier (a staunch Catholic and local resident), Ned Hanlon and the Works Minister, Mr. William Power. Another one of the official guests caused quite a stir at the time. Present at the laying of the foundation stone was Irish hero, revolutionary, president of Sien Fein, Taoiseach (Prime Minister) of Ireland (from 1932‚Äì1948, 1951‚Äì1954 and 1957‚Äì1959) and future President of Ireland (for two seven-year terms from 1959‚Äì1973), √âamon de Valera. Mr de Valera was travelling around Australia, at the invitation of a bishop, to speak and associate with the many Irish immigrants who had made Australia their home. At the ceremony at Rosalie, Mr de Valera said, according to press reports at the time, that ‚Äú...the new school was part of the evidence of the magnificent works of charity and community effort that he had seen in every capital of the Commonwealth.‚Äù It was at this time that Archbishop Duhig‚Äôs vision was finally fulfilled, that is schooling of Catholic boys from grade 1 to grade 12. As the school grew further building projects that were funded by the Parents and Friends Association including the building of the swimming pool (1965), the science block (1969) and the library block (1975). In 1955 the school acquired of bushland in the suburb of Fig Tree Pocket, in Brisbane‚Äôs west and rechristened the land ‚ÄúLavalla‚Äù. Luton White, owner of a chain of garages, sold his land cheaply to the Marist Brothers and the parish at the time on the basis that it be used by the students of Rosalie College for their sports. The visionary Principal, Brother Cyprian Dowd (1935‚Äì41, 1953‚Äì59), grabbed this opportunity. Brother Cyprian, by all accounts, was a tireless worker and he ‚Äúmarshalled the troops\\" and over a six-month period the scrub was cleared by parents, old boys, students, members of the parish and a horse (named Dolly) to create four new sports ovals. The grounds were officially opened on 16 October 1955 by Monsignor Steele. The school continued to grow and a Junior College (61 Fernberg Rd) for grades 4‚Äì7 was constructed in 1971 at a cost of A$142000. Archbishop Patrick Mary O'Donnell formally blessed the building on 6 June 1971. All of these buildings have been refurbished in recent years and the Parents & Friends Association has overseen the construction of tennis courts, cricket practice wickets, basketball courts and a covered assembly area. Although the school was built by (and largely funded by) the people of Rosalie and the surrounding parishes, in 1970 the school became an Archdiocesan College and under the control of the Brisbane Catholic Education office. In accordance to Catholic canon law this can occur only if there is no parish priest residing in the area as was the case then for a short time. That is its administration was no longer done in the community but externally at the central offices of Brisbane Catholic Education. Subsequently, Father Dennis Power, was assigned the parish however administration was not returned to the Parish. Father Power, worked tirelessly in promoting the school as well as the primary school, the Sacred Heart Convent, adjacent to the school, until his retirement in the 1990s. At its peak, in the mid-1970s, the school (which also had junior years 4‚Äì7) had about 550 children enrolled. Controversially, at the time, Brisbane Catholic Education decided to close the Junior College (61 Fernberg Rd) down in 1979 and it became part of the Senior College in 1980. The decision was controversial as there was no reason given for the closure except that the adjacent convent, Sacred Heart Convent, which catered for children from grades 1 ‚Äì 7 was losing boys to the junior school in grade 4, meaning that the grades 4 ‚Äì 7 at the convent were almost exclusively female even though the school was co-educational. This was deemed not to be in the best interests of the convent. The controversy was fuelled further by Brisbane Catholic Education‚Äôs decision to then abruptly close Sacred Heart Convent down in 1995. Unfortunately this decision to close the Junior College ( and the convent) affected the high school as it had lost its ‚Äúfeeder‚Äù school, a decision which was to haunt it later. On 9 March 1989 Pope John Paul II paternally imparted a Special Apostolic Blessing as a pledge of continued divine protection on the school on the occasion of its Diamond Jubilee. In 2000 Rosalie parish became part of cluster of three parishes with the surrounding suburbs of Red Hill and Bardon, and finally in 2005 the new larger parish was christened the Jubilee Catholic Community. From the start of the school and in line with the Marist philosophy and to promote Catholic education amongst the working class the school fees were kept at an ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù rate. Accordingly, Marist College Rosalie has produced a colourful array of old boys. Recent history The school suffered a further blow when on 13 July 2006 Archbishop Bathersby of Brisbane, acting under advice from Brisbane Catholic Education, made the decision to close Marist College Rosalie, with the last class going through in 2008. There was an outcry from parents, old boys and the community in general. There was substantial local media coverage of the parent‚Äôs reactions in relation to availability of placements for their boys in Catholic high schools. There was also concern from the wider Catholic community regarding the closure of a number of schools under Archbishop Bathersby. The concerns included reservations about an increasingly bureaucratic church run by ex-brothers and nuns who are out of touch with the community and the numbers of Catholic boys that would be thrown onto the State schooling system at a time when secularism is increasing hold in a once large Catholic community. Philosophic concerns were also raised regarding the place of ‚Äúeconomic rationalism‚Äù in Catholicism and Catholic schooling. Brisbane Catholic Education defended its advice to Archbishop Bathersby by saying that the school was not viable in its current position and that school-age students of the Catholic faith in its catchments area were decreasing. Opponents of the school's closure say that Brisbane Catholic Education based its decision to close the college due to declining student numbers on outdated demographic figures from 2001 and ignored the findings of its own marketing research report which indicated that appropriate marketing strategies would guarantee a viable future. They were vocal in their criticism of Brisbane Catholic Education by citing official government figures and referring to poor work practices and managerial incompetence within Brisbane Catholic Education as the real reason for the school's misfortune. Still other opponents of the school's closure referred to hidden agendas in relation to the land the school and its sport fields sit on. Subsequent to the announcement a group of old boys, business leaders, parents, and concerned Catholics calling itself \\"Save Rosa\\" formed the \\"Rosalie College Interim Board\\" and have lobbied to keep the school open or open another Catholic School on the site. The group has been successful in gaining official support from local and Queensland State politicians, local businesses and the community as well as behind the scene support from Catholic Orders, Catholic priests and senior public servants. The group, headed by high-profile businessman Barry Maranta approached the Brisbane Archdiocese with a business plan and approved curriculum but their offer was rejected without explanation. The group has vowed to keep working towards a solution that results in a school at the site. It remains to be seen what will come of the school but concerns have been published in the local media regarding the fact that all of the Catholic high schools in the vicinity are at capacity and have started to refuse Catholic boys admission. Apparently this has led to a crisis which is eroding the faith in the Catholic Church administration, especially given that members of the Archdiocese are complaining that the Archbishop is either not responding or not seeing letters addressed to him regarding the problem. The school closed on 30 November 2008. In January 2009 the campus became the Lavalla Centre and is used by the Marist Brothers for teacher in-service training and retreats. The local Catholic parish organises youth activities on the site. Sporting tradition The college offers a wide variety of sports including soccer, rugby union, cricket, swimming, track and field, basketball, netball, cross-country, water polo, chess, volleyball and tennis. In the past the college had participated actively and won awards in boxing and rugby league (for many years the school fielded a team in the AMCO and Commonwealth Bank Cups). Boxing was introduced as a major sporting activity as early as 1931 and continued into the mid-1950s and the school had many state and national champions over that time. The school won the following premierships: * Rugby League (Premiership) - 1939 (the very first Rugby League premiership in the competition) * Rugby - TAS 1sts Blue Division Premiers 2001(joint with St Columban's College), TAS 1sts Red Division premiers 2006, 1987 * Tennis (1st IV Premierships) - 1952, 1966, 1967 * Cricket (XI Premierships) - 1936, 1937, 1938, 1940, 1943, 1944, 1947, 1956, 1960, 1961, 1968, 1969, 1970. Crest, motto and uniform The College colours are Cerise and Blue. The Latin motto ‚ÄúAge Quod Agis‚Äù when translated reads ‚ÄúWhatever you do, do it wholeheartedly and well‚Äù. There are two symbols on the shield. On the left the Marist ‚ÄúM‚Äù, the international crest of the Marist Brothers order. On the right are an open book and a torch, the symbols of learning. The Marist Brothers Rosalie crest Uniform Standard school uniform for juniors is a blue shirt, blue jumper with school logo, blue and cerise striped tie. For senior it is a white shirt, blue tie with centrally placed school crest, and a blue blazer with cerise trim. Football uniforms for all divisions except the 1sts are a blue jersey with cerise large horizontal bar with two smaller bars. For the 1sts a white jersey with a blue and cerise horizontal stripe through the middle (first used during the 1960s and used initially in the TAS Rugby Union competition. The white jersey was later used by the 1sts in Rugby League competition. The 1st grade were affectionately known as ‚ÄúThe White Knights‚Äù). For athletics cerise and blue vertical stripes were used on the singlets. Notable alumni=Religion * Bishop John Joseph Gerry (1927‚Äì2017), Catholic priest, Auxiliary Bishop for Brisbane.

Parallax measurements provide a distance estimate of approximately 356 light years from the Sun, but it is drifting closer with a radial velocity of ‚àí63 km/s. It is predicted to come as close as in 1.345 million years. HD 231701 is named Uruk. The name was selected in the NameExoWorlds campaign by Iraq, during the 100th anniversary of the IAU. Uruk was an ancient city of the Sumer and Babylonian civilizations in Mesopotamia. This object is an ordinary F-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of F8 V. It is around three to 4.5 billion years old and may be evolving onto the subgiant branch. It is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 4 km/s and has low chromospheric activity. HD 231701 has 1.2 times the mass of the Sun and 1.45 times the Sun's radius. It is radiating 2.6 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,081 K.

Division), formally the 27th Division (2nd Royal W√ºrttemberg) (27. Division (2. K√∂niglich W√ºrttembergische)), was a unit of the Prussian/German Army.During the period of German unification (1866‚Äì1871), the states of the German Empire entered into conventions with Prussia regarding their armies and only the Bavarian Army remained autonomous. The Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg remained semi-autonomous on some military matters but its army was fully integrated into the Prussian Army. It was headquartered in Ulm in the eastern part of the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg.G√ºnter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815‚Äì1939. (Biblio Verlag, Osnabr√ºck, 1993), Bd. 1, p.123; Claus von Bredow, bearb., Historische Rang- und Stammliste des deuschen Heeres (1905), p.1129. The division was subordinated in peacetime to the XIII (Royal W√ºrttemberg) Corps (XIII. (K√∂niglich W√ºrttembergisches) Armeekorps).Bredow, p. 1123. The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division was raised and recruited in the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. Among the most famous soldiers to serve in the division was Erwin Rommel (later Generalfeldmarschall) who fought as a lieutenant with the division on the Western Front before being transferred to the W√ºrttemberg mountain battalion. Evolution of the 27th Division The 27th Division was formed in 1817 as W√ºrttemberg's 2nd Infantry Division. It was merged with W√ºrttemberg's 1st Infantry Division on July 27, 1849, to form W√ºrttemberg's Infantry Division and was dissolved in 1868.Bredow, p.1128. The division was reestablished after the Franco-Prussian War on December 18, 1871, as the 27th Division (2nd Royal W√ºrttemberg), taking its new numbering as part of the Prussian Army structure. Combat chronicle Although the 27th Division was not formed until 1871, its predecessors saw action in the Austro- Prussian War of 1866 against Prussia and in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 on the side of Prussia against France. The W√ºrttemberg Infantry Division saw action in the Main campaign in 1866. During the Franco-Prussian War, the W√ºrttemberg Field Division fought at the battles of W≈ìrth and Sedan, and then participated in the Siege of Paris and the Battle of Villiers (November 30 and December 2, 1870).Bredow, p. 1124 During World War I, the division served on the Western Front. In 1914, it fought in the Allied Great Retreat. It fought in the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and the Battle of Arras in 1917. The division served in the 1918 German Spring Offensive and the subsequent Allied counteroffensives, including the Hundred Days Offensive and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Allied intelligence rated the division as one of the very best German divisions and described it as a first class shock unit.27\\\\.

It operated Supermarine Southampton flying boats from January 1928, as well as other types. Along with Fighter Squadron, Seaplane Squadron was a component of No. 1 Flying Training School, based at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria. Seaplane Squadron was responsible for coastal reconnaissance, training aircrew to operate seaplanes, and supporting the Royal Australian Navy. It also conducted survey flights over remote parts of Australia and mapped the Darwin‚ÄìSydney section of the Empire Air Mail Scheme route. Seaplane Squadron was disbanded in June 1939. History Although the first entry in Seaplane Squadron records is dated 16 February 1934, the official history of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) between the wars refers to the unit as having been in operation when Australia acquired two Supermarine Southampton flying boats, which entered service in January 1928.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 104, 186‚Äì187 The Southamptons formed a coastal reconnaissance flight within Seaplane Squadron, which also operated other aircraft for seaplane training. Seaplane Squadron was one of two formations raised at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, under the auspices of No. 1 Flying Training School (No. 1 FTS), the other being Fighter Squadron, which operated Bristol Bulldogs. No. 1 FTS had been the first unit to be formed as part of the new Australian Air Force on 31 March 1921 (the prefix \\"Royal\\" was added in August that year).Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 41Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 29 alt=Two men holding outer struts of triple-finned flying boat with parachutes trailing behind The Southamptons (nicknamed \\"Swamptons\\") were the biggest aircraft in the RAAF's inventory at the time and a new seaplane hangar was specially constructed for them at Point Cook.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 121, 175 On 22 June, one of the flying boats was overturned by strong wind on the Torrens River en route to meet the four Southamptons of the Royal Air Force's Far East Flight near Adelaide. Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 103‚Äì104 In their naval cooperation role, the Southamptons were required to locate and shadow \\"enemy\\" cruisers on exercises. They also trialled radio communications between aircraft and naval ships. The Southamptons were used for parachute training with the \\"pull-off\\" technique, which involved standing on a small platform near the outer wing struts, opening the parachute and being dragged from the aircraft by the wind.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 338 In the early 1930s, the flying boats took part in several forestry surveys in Tasmania.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 379‚Äì380 From June 1935 to February 1936, a Southampton was employed to map the Darwin‚ÄìSydney section of the Empire Air Mail Scheme route; its survey work ultimately took it to New Guinea and around the Australian continent.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 111 Seaplane Squadron undertook search-and-rescue work with both the Southamptons and Supermarine Seagulls; the former were involved in the abortive search for the airliner Miss Hobart, a de Havilland DH.86 that vanished in Bass Strait on 19 October 1934.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 308 One of the Southamptons was taken out of service in 1937; the other continued flying until 1939.Coulthard- Clark, The Third Brother, p. 176 alt=Rear view of biplane on floats aboard a ship In October 1929, Seaplane Squadron received a locally designed amphibian, the Wackett Widgeon II; it crashed into the sea off Point Cook on 6 January 1930, killing all three occupants. Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 265‚Äì266 Another Wackett design, the Warrigal II landplane, was fitted with floats and assigned to Seaplane Squadron in September 1932 for trials and possible use as a trainer and patrol aircraft; it was considered successful in the latter role but maintenance issues led to its disposal in July 1933. Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 271‚Äì272 The squadron also operated de Havilland Moths. In May 1934, one of these was flown to Darwin, Northern Territory, where it was fitted with floats and undertook reconnaissance and survey work in cooperation with HMAS Morseby, before being converted back to a landplane and returning to Point Cook in July. Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 381 In December 1935, a Gipsy Moth fitted with skis embarked for Antarctica aboard the RRS Discovery II to locate missing explorer Lincoln Ellsworth. Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 419‚Äì422 Seaplane Squadron began operating Avro Ansons for navigation courses and cross-country exercises in 1937; one exercise in November 1938 involved a round-Australia flight. A new headquarters building for the squadron was constructed at Point Cook in the late 1930s, as part of general improvements to RAAF facilities owing to the threat of war in Europe.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 128Campbell-Wright, An Interesting Point, p. 121 Throughout their existence, Seaplane and Fighter Squadrons remained under the control of No. 1 FTS and were \\"really little more than flights\\", in the words of the official history.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 127‚Äì128 The final entry in Seaplane Squadron records was made on 30 June 1939.

By the early 1960s, it had bought all the materials needed for production, had no debt and a lot of cash and was bought out by the Columbian Rope Company in 1965. A member of the Peabody family which had long been investors acquired rights to the brand and relocated a portion of the equipment to Haiti to continue producing sisal rope. Parts of the original machinery and 1/3 of the original rope walk building is now on display at Mystic Seaport in Mystic, Connecticut. The original rope walk building was 110 feet, the length needed to twist a 90 foot long rope. Rope was made manually until the 1890s. To make rope, men put fibers around their waist and walked backward down the rope walk as they twisted the fibers in a process similar to how yarn is made. The twisted pieces were stored on pegs on the wall. Eventually another man wound the twisted fibers on a wheel. A model of the rope walk is on display at the Plymouth Cordage Museum in the original mill #3, under the tower. The museum is open noon to 4pm each weekend includes over 2,000 original items and publications donated by prior employees and their relatives. The Plymouth Cordage Company played a small role in the Sacco and Vanzetti case. Bartolomeo Vanzetti worked at the company in the early part of the century. Upton Sinclair's historical novel \\"Boston\\" has several chapters devoted to the company when his elderly heroine goes to work for the factory. Plymouth Cordage also operated a factory in Welland, Ontario. A detailed history of Welland operations can be found at the Welland Public Library Local History site. Cordage Commerce Center Wide view of the Cordage Factory, with the prominent smokestack to the left. In modern times, the Cordage factory property in North Plymouth has been turned into a large retail and office center. The building, now known as Cordage Commerce Center, houses the Plymouth MBTA station, a terminus for the Old Colony Line. The factory also contains several restaurants, offices, and stores. University of Massachusetts Boston currently offers some classes in a wing of the building. The largest retailer is Mill Stores. There was previously a Wal-Mart located on the property, but it closed in 2005 and relocated to Colony Place, also in Plymouth. In 2012, much of the former plant was demolished due to deterioration related to the quick construction of the facility in 1899. Plans for the site include the eventual building of condominiums.

Derivation Also for years the origin of the name was quoted from the book of surnames of Scotland, a copy did exist in the library of the University of Abertay in Dundee, stating the name originating from Caen or possibly from the commune of S√©merville (Semervilla 1209), near √âvreux, that is 141 miles from Caen. However, there are other possibilities, first of all a disappeared place name of Cotentin Sumelleville (Summerleevilla ab 1210) closer to Caen. Other hypothesis like Sommervieu (Sommerveium 1241), 18,5 miles from Caen, were proposed. History In 1066 the Lord of Somerville, Sir Gaultier / Walter de Somerville joined William the conqueror on his invasion of England, for his support Sir Gaultier de Somerville was given land in the North of England. By the twelfth century, the Somervilles were granted land and title of lord in Scotland and were at one time among the noble families of Scotland. Alternatively, Somerville can also be a Scottish clan surname.http://www.clansomerville.net/ The Irish House of Somerville began when William Somerville came to Ireland in 1690. William was an Episcopalian minister forced to flee from his manse when it was attacked by Covenanters. William brought his sons William and Thomas with him to Ireland. While the younger William returned to Scotland, his brother Thomas stayed in Ireland. Thomas would be educated at Trinity College in Dublin eventually earning a BA in 1711. He entered the church of his father and was ordained a minister at Cloyne Cathedral in 1715. It was in 1732 that Thomas was made the rector of Myross and Castlehaven. It was his son Thomas who by becoming a very successful merchant with Newfoundland and the West Indies was able to build up the Irish house of Somerville to the ranks of landed gentry a class out of which the Somerville clan had dropped for five generations.Somerville and Ross, The world of the Irish RM by Gifford Lewis Penguin Books LTD.

Life  Harari was born Richard (Dick) Falk Goldman, in Rochester, New York. He studied at the Syracuse University School of Fine Arts. He went to Paris in the 1930s, where he studied with Fernand L√©ger from 1932 to 1934; he also studied with Marcel Gromaire and Andr√© Lhote. Following a visit to Palestine, he returned to the United States in 1935. He helped found the American Abstract Artists in 1936. Some of his works of this period record his reaction as a Jew to the rise of Fascism in Europe; an example is The Dictators (1938, oil and collage on canvas; now in the Jewish Museum, New York). His first New York exhibition was in 1939, at Mercury Gallery. He worked in both a semi-abstract style, and a precise realist style; inspired by the work of William Michael Harnett, he painted many trompe l'oeil still lifes. Several silkscreens from this period are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and in the Yale University Collection. In the 1940s he produced artwork for the covers of magazines, including Fortune. He also contributed cartoons to The New Masses, which led to his being blacklisted in the 1950s during the McCarthy era. Using his gifts for Realism, he became a successful portrait painter affiliated with Portraits, Inc. One of his portraits is in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington D.C. Harari taught at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan from 1974 to 1990, and at the Art Students League from 1984 to 1999, where most of his classes were filled to capacity. He stopped teaching when he could no longer see. With the Reagan presidency, his political leanings became increasingly conservative. A patriot to the end, and per his request, his coffin was draped with the American flag. He was elected into the National Academy of Design in 1990 as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1994. In 1997 a traveling retrospective of his work was mounted at the Montclair Art Museum in New Jersey. He died in Halthorne, New York in 2000. Harari's work is included in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

Design and development The AI-26 engine was designed by A.G Ivchenko in 1945 with the early designation M-26, later the designation was changed to AI-26. Like the Shvetsov ASh-21 which is basically one bank of cylinders from the Shvetsov ASh-82, the AI-26 was also influenced by the ASh-82. The AI-26 retained the bore, stroke and displacement of the ASh-21 while incorporating new features peculiar to its role. This similarity allowed the AI-26 to use the same production jigs as the ASh-21 and ASh-82 which reduced costs and simplified production. The engine was envisioned as a helicopter engine, but the early test models lacked the necessary equipment to facilitate this role, such as an auxiliary cooling fan, reduction gears and clutch. The GR suffix means \\"Gelikopter\\", or helicopter. Engine testing was completed by early 1946 and by 1947 helicopter testing had begun.

The siege is documented in several sources including the Hebrew Bible, Assyrian documents and in the Lachish relief, a well-preserved series of reliefs which once decorated the Assyrian king Sennacherib's palace at Nineveh.The Illustrated Dictionary and Concordance of the Bible - Page 566 by Geoffrey Wigoder Background Several kingdoms in the Levant ceased to pay taxes to the Assyrian king Senncharib. In retribution, he initiated a campaign to re-subjugate the rebelling kingdoms, among them the Kingdom of Judah. After defeating the rebels of Ekron in Philistia, Sennacharib set out to conquer Judah and, on his way to Jerusalem, came across Lachish: the second most important of the Jewish cities. Battlefield The battlefield was the walled city of Lachish, situated on a hill. The northern part of the hill is steeper than the southern side and due to that the gate is situated there. On top of the fact that the hill as of itself is quite high, the wall further makes the city hard to breach. Inside the city itself there was a castle with significant walls. Forces of each side=Assyrian army The Assyrian Army was the most effective force of its time and was divided mostly into three different categories: *Infantry, which included both close-combat troops using spears, and archers. There were also hired mercenaries throwing stones (slingers). The infantry was highly trained and worked alongside military engineers in order to breach sieges. *Cavalry; Assyrian cavalry were among the finest in the ancient Middle East and included both close-combat cavalry units with spears and mounted archers, which could both use the agility of the horses alongside long-range attacks. *Chariots, which were not used as much in sieges as in regular land engagements. Judean army The Judean military force was insignificant compared to the professional and massive Assyrian army and mostly included local militias and mercenaries. There were barely any cavalrymen and chariots in the Judean army which mostly included infantry, either for close combat (spearmen) or long range combat (archers), they were also significantly less organized. Siege Assyrian siege ramp Due to the steepness of the northern side of Lachish the Assyrian Army attacked from the south, where the Jewish defenders situated themselves on the walls. The Jewish defenders threw stones and shot arrows at the advancing Assyrians; the Assyrians started shooting arrows and stones themselves, creating a skirmish between the two armies. Meanwhile, Assyrian military engineers built a ramp to the east of the main gate where Assyrian and Jewish troops began engaging in close combat. The Assyrians meanwhile brought siege engines to the ramp and broke the wall; the Jewish defenders could not hold the Assyrian army and retreated, with some attempting to escape from the other side of the hill. Subjugation Judean captives being led away into slavery by the Assyrians after the siege of Lachish in 701 B.C. This relief is important for the knowledge of Judean dress. The fall of Lachish, King Sennacherib reviews Judaean prisoners. Judaean people being deported into exile after the capture of Lachish The city was captured by the Assyrians, its inhabitants led into captivity and the leaders of Lachish tortured to death. The town was abandoned, but resettled after the return from Babylonia. Assyrian reliefs portraying the siege of Lachish clearly show battering rams attacking the vulnerable parts of the city.Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible - Page 157 by David Noel Freedman The British Museum has a superb set of relief carvings which depicted the siege in some detail. It shows the Assyrian soldiers firing arrows, and slingstones, and approaching the walls of Lachish using mudbrick ramps. The attackers shelter behind wicker shields, and deploy battering rams. The walls and towers of Lachish are shown crowded with defenders shooting arrows, throwing rocks and torches on the heads of the attackers. Siege of Lachish Relief in the British Museum. The captions for the relief at the British Museum say: After the capture of Lachish, Assyrian soldiers carry off plunder from the governor's palace: a bundle of scimitars, round shields, a chariot, a throne, and a pair of incense-burners. Below, Judean prisoners move in families, taking their goods and animals with them into exile.\\" Panels 9-10 The procession of prisoners from Lachish continues, moving through a rocky landscape with vines, fig trees, and perhaps olives in the background. Officials regarded as responsible for the rebellion against Assyria are treated more severely: two of them are being flayed alive. Panels 11-13 Sennacherib, on a magnificent throne, watches as prisoners are brought before him and sometimes executed. There is a tent behind him, his chariot is in the foreground, and his bodyguard are stationed around. The King's face has been deliberately slashed, perhaps by an enemy soldier at the fall of Nineveh in 612 BC. Panels 14-16 This panel, which closes the Lachish series, shows the base camp from which the siege was conducted. It is fortified, with a road through the middle. Servants are at work in tents, and two priests are performing a ceremony in front of the chariots on which are mounted the standards of the gods. The reliefs continues showing the looting of the city, and defenders are shown being thrown over the ramparts, impaled, having their throats cut and asking for mercy. A bird's eye plan of the city is shown with house interiors shown in section. Aftermath After he captured the second most important city in Judah, Sennacherib encamped there and then sent his rabshakeh to capture Jerusalem.  Cultural references  The Siege of Lachish is the subject of an eponymous song (and single) by metal band Melechesh.

Often, nectar robbers avoid contact with the floral reproductive structures, and therefore do not facilitate plant reproduction via pollination. Because many species that act as pollinators also act as nectar robbers, nectar robbing is considered to be a form of exploitation of plant-pollinator mutualism. Nectar robbers vary greatly in species diversity and include species of carpenter bees, bumblebees, stingless Trigona bees, solitary bees, wasps, ants, hummingbirds, passerine birds, and flowerpiercer birds. Nectar robbing mammals include a fruit batOlmos, F.; Boulhosa, R. (2000). A meeting of opportunists: birds and other visitors to Mabea fistulifera (Euphorbiaceae) in florescences.

History Records of nectar robbing in nature date back at least to 1793 when German naturalist Christian Konrad Sprengel observed bumblebees perforating flowers. Charles Darwin observed bumblebees stealing nectar from flowers in 1859.  Forms of floral larceny  Nectar robbing is specifically the behavior of consuming nectar from a perforation (robbing hole) in the floral tissue rather than from the floral opening. There are two main types of nectar robbing: primary robbing, which requires that the nectar forager perforates the floral tissues itself, and secondary robbing, which is foraging from a robbing hole created by a primary robber. The term \\"floral larceny\\" has been proposed to include the entire suite of foraging behaviors for floral rewards that can potentially disrupt pollination. They include \\"nectar theft\\" (floral visits that remove nectar from the floral opening without pollinating the flower), and \\"base working\\" (removing nectar from in between petals, which generally bypasses floral reproductive structures). Effects on plant fitness Pollination systems are mostly mutualistic, meaning that the plant benefits from the pollinator's transport of male gametes and the pollinator benefits from a reward, such as pollen or nectar. As nectar robbers receive the rewards without direct contact with the reproductive parts of the flower, their behaviour is easily assumed to be cheating. However, the effect of robbery on the plant is sometimes neutral or even positive. For example, the proboscis of Eurybia elvina does not come in contact with the reproductive parts of the flower in Calathea ovandensis, but this does not lead to significant reduction in fruit-set of the plant. In another example, when 80 percent of the flowers in a study site were robbed and the robbers did not pollinate, neither the seed nor fruit set were negatively affected. The effect of floral-nectar robbing on plant fitness depends on several issues. Firstly, nectar robbers such as carpenter bees, bumble bees and some birds can pollinate flowers. Pollination may take place when the body of the robber contacts the reproductive parts of the plant while it robs, or during pollen collection which some bees practice in concert with nectar robbing. The impact of Trigona bees (e.g. Trigona ferricauda) on a plant is almost always negative, probably because their aggressive territorial behaviour effectively evicts legitimate pollinators. Nectar robbers may change the behaviour of legitimate pollinators in other ways, such as by reducing the amount of nectar available. This may force pollinators to visit more flowers in their nectar foraging. The increased number of flowers visited and longer flight distances increase pollen flow and outcrossing, which is beneficial for the plant because it lessens inbreeding depression. This requires a robber's not completely consuming all of a flower's nectar. When a robber consumes all of a flower's nectar, legitimate pollinators may avoid the flower, resulting in a negative effect on plant fitness. The response of different species of legitimate pollinators also varies. Some species, like the bumble bees Bombus appositus or B. occidentalis and many species of nectar-feeding birds can distinguish between robbed and unrobbed plants and minimize their energy cost of foraging by avoiding heavily robbed flowers. Pollinating birds may be better at this than insects, because of their higher sensory capability. The ways that bees distinguish between robbed and unrobbed flowers have not been studied, but they have been thought to be related to the damage on petal tissue after robbery or changes in nectar quality. Xylocopa sonorina steals nectar through a slit they make in the base of the petals. If nectar robbing severely reduces the success of legitimate pollinators they may be able to switch to other nectar sources. Nectar robbing, especially by birds, can damage the reproductive parts of a flower and thus diminish the fitness of a plant. In this case, the effect of robbery on a plant is direct. A good example of an indirect effect is the change in the behaviour of a legitimate pollinator, which either increases or decreases the fitness of a plant. There are both primary and secondary nectar robbers. Secondary robbers are those that take advantage of the holes made by primary robbers. While most flies and bees are secondary robbers, some species, such as Bombylius major, act as primary robbers. The effect of robbing is positive if the robber also pollinates or increases the pollination by the legitimate pollinator, and negative if the robber damages the reproductive parts of a plant or reduces pollination success, either by competing with the legitimate pollinator or by lessening the attractiveness of the flower. Distinguishing between a legitimate pollinator and a nectar robber can be difficult. Evolutionary implications Pollination systems cause coevolution, as in the close relationships between figs and fig wasps as well as yuccas and yucca moths. If nectar robbers have an effect (direct or indirect) on a plant or pollinator fitness, they are part of the coevolution process. Where nectar robbing is detrimental to the plant, a plant species might evolve to minimize the traits that attract the robbers or develop some type of protective mechanism to hinder them. Another option is to try to neutralize negative effects of nectar robbers. Nectar robbers are adapted for more efficient nectar robbing: for instance, hummingbirds and Diglossa flowerpiercers have serrated bills that are thought to aid them in incising flower tissue for nectar robbing. Nectar robbers may only get food in illegitimate ways because of the mismatch between the morphologies of their mouthparts and the floral structure; or they may rob nectar as a more energy-saving way to get nectar from flowers. It is not completely clear how pollination mutualisms persist in the presence of cheating nectar robbers. Nevertheless, as exploitation is not always harmful for the plant, the relationship may be able to endure some cheating. Mutualism may simply confer a higher payoff than nectar robbing. Defences in flowering plants Even though there has not been much research on the defences evolved in plants against nectar robbers, the adaptations have been assumed not to rise from traits used in interactions between plants and herbivores (especially florivores). Some defences may have evolved through traits originally referred to pollination. Defences against nectar robbers have been thought to include toxins and secondary compounds, escape in time or space, physical barriers and indirect defences. Toxins and secondary compounds are likely to act as a defence against nectar robbing because they are often found in floral nectar or petal tissue. There is some evidence that secondary compounds in nectar only affect nectar robbers and not the pollinators. One example is a plant called Catalpa speciosa which produces nectar containing iridoid glycosides that deter nectar-thieving ants but not legitimate bee pollinators. Low sugar concentration in nectar may also deter nectar robbers without deterring pollinators because dilute nectar does not yield net energy profits for robbers. If robbers and pollinators forage at different times of day, plants may produce nectar according to the active period of a legitimate pollinator. This is an example of a defence by escaping in time. Another way to use time in defence is to flower only for one day as a tropical shrub Pavonia dasypetala does to avoid the robbing Trigona bees. Escaping in space refers to a situation in which plant avoids being robbed by growing in a certain location like next to a plant which is more attractive to the robbers. The last two methods of protection are physical barriers and indirect defence like symbionts. Tightly packed flowers and unfavourably sized corolla tubes, bract liquid moats and toughness of the corolla or sepal are barriers for some nectar robbers. A good example of an indirect defence is to attract symbiotic predators (like ants) by nectar or other rewards to scare away the robbers. The term 'resistance' refers to the plant's ability to live and reproduce in spite of nectar robbers. This may happen, for example, by compensating the lost nectar by producing more. With the help of defence and resistance, mutualisms can persist even in the presence of cheaters.

Biography Gibson was born in Glossop and was educated at Manchester Grammar School, where he was in the first XI from 1951 to 1954 and was captain in the last two years.Wisden Obituaries in 1963 In 1953 he played for the Public Schools XI and at the age of 17 began playing for the Lancashire Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship. He went to Brasenose College, Oxford, and in 1955 began his first-class cricketing career with Oxford University. He made his first-class debut against Gloucestershire, and played fifteen first- class games for the university and followed up his series of university matches playing for Lancashire 2nd XI. Gibson played as a lower-order batsman for Oxford, and took just four wickets with the ball during his first season. He continued to play for the both teams in 1956, with similar batting statistics, scoring three further first-class half-centuries. In 1957, Gibson achieved his career-best innings of 100 not out in a draw for Oxford University against Gloucestershire. He joined Derbyshire in the 1957 season and spent his university holidays in both the first and second teams. He made his County Championship debut for Derbyshire against Nottinghamshire, in which he scored a half-century in his first innings. He played six further first- class matches for the Derbyshire in the latter stages of the season, when Derbyshire finished the season in fourth place in the County Championship. Gibson played for Oxford University in 1958, keeping his position in the upper order. After Oxford, he continued his medical training at Guy's Hospital, playing cricket for the hospital and also for the Free Foresters. By 1961 season, he was turning out again for the Derbyshire Second XI and played one first-class game. He also played two matches for Marylebone Cricket Club. Gibson was described as excellent batsman especially strong in strokes off the back foot, a fine fieldsman and a useful leg-break bowler. He was a right- handed batsman and played 92 innings in 51 first-class matches with an average of 19.96 and a top score of 100 not out. He was a leg-break and googly bowler and took 51 first-class wickets with an average of 38.41 and a best performance of 5 for 29.Ian Gibson at Cricket Archive His mental health deteriorated at the start of the 1960s, with Gibson suffering a nervous breakdown just before Christmas in 1962. Weighed down by high parental expectations and his workload as a doctor, Gibson committed suicide by gassing himself in Bowdon at the age of 26.

Yet his blog contains highly questionable information-presented very \\"scientifically\\" of course, replete with charts and graphs-but all directed toward the end of making the scientific consensus on human-caused global warming seem faulty (in fact, it's extremely robust) He believes that global warming is occurring, but that it is not as bad as has been reported, and that carbon dioxide plays a much smaller part than the sun in causing climatic change.Anthony Watts. It's the Sun, stupid, wattsupwiththat.com, April 6, 2007.Ryan Olson,, Chico Enterprise Record, 2007. Watts has written that variations in solar irradiance, the sun's magnetic field and solar wind are driving changes to the climate, contrary to the scientific consensus that the primary cause of climate change is an increase in greenhouse gasses, including carbon dioxide.:Climate change is occurring, is caused largely by human activities, and poses significant risks...This conclusion is based on a substantial array of scientific evidence, including recent work, and is consistent with the conclusions of recent assessments by the [USGCRP], the [IPCC], and other assessments of the state of scientific knowledge on climate change...Most of the warming over the last several decades can be attributes to human activities that release carbon dioxide (CO2), and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels-coal, oil, and natural gas-for energy is the single largest human driver of climate change Climate models have been used to examine the role of the sun in recent warming,: \\"Numerous experiments have been conducted using climate models to determine the likely causes of the 20th-century climate change.

In all climate models, increases in carbon dioxide cause warming at the surface and in the troposphere, but lead to cooling of the stratosphere... models also calculate that the human-caused depletion of stratospheric ozone has had a strong cooling effect in the stratosphere. There is a good match between the...combined carbon dioxide and ozone changes and the observed pattern of tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling.\\" have shown that the sun is not a significant factor driving climate change.: \\"It is extremely unlikely (<5%) that the global pattern of warming observed during the past half century can be explained without external forcing.

The clear message from fingerprint studies is that the observed warming over the last half-century cannot be explained by natural factors, and is instead caused primarily by human factors.\\" Watts is a signatory to the Leipzig Declaration as well as the Manhattan Declaration, which calls for the immediate halt to any tax funded attempts to counteract climate change or reduce CO2 emissions, and suggests the consensus among climate scientists is \\"false\\".

Cherry-picking quotes in order to make the scientists appear as though they were discussing data manipulation, bloggers such as Watts whipped up a pseudo-scandal that reverberated for years despite the fact that a series of nine investigations in the U.S. and the U.K. cleared the scientists of any wrongdoing. wherein emails of several climatologists were published by a hacker.

This photograph was used in the report by Watts published by the Heartland Institute in 2009. In 2007, Watts launched the Surface Stations project, encouraging volunteers to take photographs of weather stations in the U.S. Historical Climatology Network to record their condition.: \\"A few critics continued to seek confirmation of their denial of the warming data on air temperatures from weather stations and satellites. In particular, former TV weatherman Anthony Watts established a popular website that mobilized people to report continental U.S. weather stations that were poorly located, such as near the exhaust of air conditioners.\\": \\"Watts also started the Web site SurfaceStations.org, which purports to identify poorly sited meteorological stations in the United States in an effort to demonstrate that the instrumental record of warming temperatures is hopelessly compromised by instrumental measurement biases.\\": \\"In 2007, Watts founded SurfaceStations.org...By early June 2009, thanks to a grass roots network of volunteers, SurfaceStations.org had examined about 70 percent of the 1,221 stations [and] classified 70 of the stations as having \\"good or best\\" reliability... since 1950, temperatures recorded at the 70 \\"good or best\\" stations are indistinguishable from the rest.\\" By 2009, around 650 volunteers had reported on around 70% of the 1,221 stations, and suggested most were below \\"good or best\\" reliability.: \\"By early June 2009, thanks to a grass roots network of volunteers, SurfaceStations.org had examined about 70 percent of the 1,221 stations [and] classified 70 of the stations as having \\"good or best\\" reliability... since 1950, temperatures recorded at the 70 \\"good or best\\" stations are indistinguishable from the rest.\\": \\"[Anthony Watts] rallied more than 650 volunteers through Watts Up With That?...The investigators found hundreds of surface weather stations across the United States that were improperly located near water treatment plants, pavements, air conditioners, and other sources of artificial heat. A photo-studded report, \\"Is the US Surface Temperature Record Reliable?\\" was published by the Heartland Institute...Though the report wasn't a peer-reviewed study, it made quite a splash in the US media and the blogosphere.\\" In March 2009 The Heartland Institute published an illustrated report authored by Watts, in which he argued that the surface temperature record in the United States was inaccurate and that the actual temperature was lower than reported.: \\"deniers say that the U.S. historical temperature record is unreliable because some weather stations are sited near trees, buildings, parking lots, air conditioners, and the like, causing the stations to record unrepresentative, and presumably warmer, local temperatures. The person most behind this claim is Anthony Watts Watts presented pictures from volunteers participating through his website to show that many surface weather stations were situated near artificial heat sources such as pavement and air conditioners, but did not show any comparison of the data from these sites and the data from well situated stations.: \\"With the assistance of the Heartland Institute, Watts published a glossy, very official-looking report about the project... absent from that report, however, was any direct comparison showing what the surface temperature record looks like both with and without the sites that Watts deemed unworthy. Scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) went ahead and calculated it themselves, producing versions of the continental U.S. average temperature curve both with and without the records in question...Eliminating the \\"suspect\\" data made virtually no difference at all; in fact, the small bias that was found was of the opposite sign. The \\"corrected\\" record showed slightly more warming!\\" The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) investigated the matter. While acknowledging the suboptimal conditions of many stations, NOAA concluded in 2010 that any bias had been nearly eliminated by their models, which compared stations over regions and time.: \\"A study by members of the NOAA National Climatic Data Center separately analyzed the sites that Watts's volunteers identified as faulty, comparing them with the acknowledged good sites. They found that any bias introduced by poor siting had been mostly compensated for by the data reduction, which was designed precisely to remove biases by comparisons over regions and time. But if the raw data only were considered, the poor sites did not tend to overestimate warming compared with what NOAA had reported, as Watts had assumed; if anything the warming from these sites was greater than NOAA's earlier figures.\\" To the very limited extent that there was any measurement bias, it was in the opposite direction of what Watts expected: stations that were considered poorly situated reported slightly cooler temperatures.: \\"There is a denial movement seeking to cast doubt on the surface temperature record using photographs of weather stations positioned near car parks, air conditioners and other warming influences (Watts, 2010). These photos attempt to communicate that the global warming trend is being inflated by poor temperature data... Poor sites show a cooler trend than good sites. All those photographed weather stations near car parks are actually giving cooler readings than pristine weather stations.\\": \\"Recent photographic documentation of poor siting conditions at stations in the U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) has led to questions regarding the reliability of surface temperature trends over the conterminous United States (CONUS)...Results indicate that...associated instrument changes have led to an artificial negative (\\"cool\\") bias in maximum temperatures and only a slight positive (\\"warm\\") bias in minimum temperatures...In summary, we find no evidence that the CONUS average temperature trends are inflated due to poor station siting.\\" This graph shows the temperature record for the 1218 stations in NOAA‚Äôs Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) from 1950 to 2009, alongside the record for the 70 stations identified as \\"good or best\\" in Watts' report published by the Heartland Institute. Watts was co-author with climatologists John Nielsen- Gammon, John Christy and Roger A. Pielke, Sr. on a paper with Souleymane Fall as lead author, which found that mean temperature trends were nearly identical between poorly sited and well-sited stations, but poor siting led to a difference in estimated diurnal temperature range. The poorly positioned stations led to an overestimate of trends in minimum temperatures, balanced by a similar underestimate of maximum temperature trends. This meant that the mean temperature trends were nearly identical across the stations. =BEST project, alleged doubling of trend by NOAA= In March 2011 Watts visited the Berkeley Earth Temperature project (BEST), and said \\"I'm prepared to accept whatever result they produce, even if it proves my premise wrong.\\" In October the project released data and a draft of their paper which produced results supporting the existing scientific consensus. Watts said that its methodology was flawed, complaining that the BEST study analyzed a larger period than his own research, and that it was not yet peer reviewed. Richard A. Muller, founder of BEST, later said their study directly addressed Watts' concern about the condition of weather stations; \\"we discovered that station quality does not affect the results. Even poor stations reflected temperature changes accurately.\\": \\"We have done an initial study of the station selection issue...we see a global warming trend that is very similar to that previously reported by the other groups. We have also studied station quality. Many U.S. stations have low quality rankings according to a study led by Anthony Watts. However, we find that the warming seen in the \\"poor\\" stations is virtually indistinguishable from that seen in the \\"good\\" stations.\\" Around 22 July 2012, Watts heard that the BEST project was about to release further material, and decided to release a paper he and Evan Jones had been working on for about a year. On 27 July he blogged that WUWT was suspended until noon on 29 July: \\"major announcement coming\\". The New York Times published a summary of further draft results from BEST, including an announcement from Muller that their study now showed that humans \\"are almost entirely the cause\\" of the warming. Shortly afterwards, Watts announced his own team's draft paper which said that previously reported temperature rises had been \\"spuriously doubled\\", and made the serious accusation that NOAA had inflated the rate by erroneous adjustments to the data. Climate scientists and other bloggers quickly found flaws in the paper. Steve McIntyre, whom Watts had named as a co-author, stressed that his involvement had been \\"very last minute and limited\\". He agreed with criticisms including the point that Watts had failed to correct for time of observation bias, and noted that independent satellite temperature measurements were closer to the NOAA figures. In 2012 BEST released its series of peer-reviewed papers confirming previous results that the surface temperature is rising.: \\"Global average temperatures for 2013 have recently been published by the BEST study...2010 and 2005 remain the warmest years since records began in the 19th century. 1998 ranks third in two records, and in Cowtan and Way's 2014 analysis...2013 is warmer than 1998.\\"  Connection with Heartland Institute  The Heartland Institute published Watts' preliminary report on weather station data, titled Is the U.S. Surface Temperature Record Reliable? Watts has appeared as a paid speaker at the International Conference on Climate Change the Heartland Institute have sponsored since 2008. Watts says that he approached Heartland in 2011 to ask for help finding a donor to set up a website devoted to presenting NOAA's data as graphs that are easily accessible to the public. Documents obtained from the Heartland Institute in February 2012 revealed that the Institute had agreed to help Watts raise $88,000 for his project. The documents state that $44,000 had already been pledged by an anonymous donor, and the Institute would seek to raise the rest. Watts has written that, aside from the help in funding this project, the Heartland Institute does not pay him a regular salary or fund his blog.

Women Engaged in War in Literature for Youth. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, 2007. 266. During her training to become an opera singer, she relayed messages that helped bring about the Allied invasion of Normandy. The 2003 novel For Freedom: The Story of a French Spy by Kimberly Brubaker Bradley was based on interviews with Hall.Bradley, Kimberly Brubaker. For Freedom: The Story of a French Spy. New York: Delacorte, 2003.  Biography  Hall was born on January 23, 1927 in Cherbourg, France to √âtienne and D√©sir√©e LeDoux David. According to Bradley's book, Hall's conviction to fight for France began on the day she and her best friend Yvette went down to the beach. There they met Yvette's mother's friend, Madame Montagne, who was pregnant with a second child. A few minutes into conversation, German planes bombed the entire beach and town square. After the missiles ceased, Yvette and Suzanne looked up to find Madame Montagne lying dead with her small child also dead at her side. It was Wednesday, 29 May 1940. Hall was thirteen years old at the time. Yvette was also badly injured. She never recovered. Later, the Germans forced Hall and her family to move out of their house and into a dingy apartment. They used her and other houses on her street as a \\"home base\\". Three years later the Germans abandoned the home, and Hall and her family came back to it. All their belongings had been sold or ruined. Two years after the bombing at the beach, Hall cut herself, and because there was no medication around to treat it, it became infected. She had to see her doctor, a Mr. Leclerc, about the abscess. As she was with her voice teacher at the time, Mr. Leclerc asked if she traveled much for her opera singing. She replied that she only traveled to Normandy and soon would to Paris. The doctor told her that he was a spy as well and asked if she would like to be a spy for the French Resistance. Hall never told her name to any of the other spies. To them, she was spy number 22, the 22nd spy in Cherbourg, where she lived. All of the other spies she met also had numbers. She never knew their names. She only ever knew Dr. Leclerc's name. He had done this because names were dangerous. When she was seventeen, Hall was captured by the Germans. She was interrogated for hours, but she never confessed. She was saved when the Allies landed nearby in 1944. Soon afterward, she found out from another captured spy, number 14, that all of the others had confessed and been killed. Dr. Leclerc and his family had been shot in the street. For her brave service during the war, Hall was awarded the Croix de Lorraine by General Charles de Gaulle. Hall married Larson Hall and had a son and daughter. She died on July 7, 2011 in Kingsport, Tennessee after having lived there for 64 years.

It is part of the Galesburg Micropolitan Statistical Area. Dahinda is in Persifer Township and lies approximately one mile north of U.S. Highway 150 and Interstate 74. Knox County Highway 15 runs from north to south through Dahinda. Once a bustling town, as time has gone on, the businesses in this community moved on, but the community still continues to exist. History From the 1899 Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois, W. Seldon Gale & Geo. Candee Gale published by Munsell Publishing Company, Publishers, Chicago & New York: \\"This place was laid out in the summer of 1888, by the Santa Fe Town and Land Company. It is held in the name of the president of that company and contains 47.74 acres. It stands on the northwest quarter of Section 24. It contains a freight and express office, two stores, a blacksmith shop, a grain elevator, and twenty-five dwellings, one of which is a boarding house. The railroad has a pump house and tank, and a fine bridge over Spoon River. R. J. Bedford is the village doctor and William G. Sargeant is postmaster and notary. There is a good school house, and a building of The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (since renamed the Community of Christ). D. C. Smith is the minister and leading man of this organization.\\" (D. C. Smith referenced above would be Don Carlos Smith, one of the sons of Joseph Smith) Origin of the Name \\"Dahinda\\" The name \\"Dahinda\\" comes from the 1855 edition of The Song of Hiawatha. by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. \\"All the air was white with moonlight, All the water black with shadow, And around him the Suggema, The mosquito, sang his war-song, And the fire-flies, Wah-wah-taysee, Waved their torches to mislead him ; And the bull-frog, the Dahinda, thrust his head into the moonlight, Fixed his yellow eyes upon him, Sobbed and sank beneath the surface.\\" According to local lore the construction workers for the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway were trying to sleep in their tents at the site where Dahinda now stands. They were kept awake by the sound of bullfrogs and chose \\"Dahinda\\" as the name for the village. Today As of 2010, the town has a post office, fire station, several houses, the Barn Bed and Breakfast, and the Dahinda United Methodist Church. The Dahinda General Store, a small shop which originally opened in 1916, reopened in 2018. The BNSF Railway runs east and west through Dahinda. The BNSF Railway bridge over the Spoon River is a steel bridge built in 1908. A pipeline runs under Dahinda, along the tracks of the BNSF. The pipeline was originally owned by the Prairie State Oil Company, later by Sinclair Oil Corporation, and today is owned by BP.Galesburg Republican Register: \\"Annals of Knox County\\" page 150, 1921 A former pumping station for the pipeline still stands in Dahinda. A large smokestack for the pumping station can be seen for miles in the Court Creek Valley, and is a focal point for the town. Oak Run, a resort community and golf course located on Spoon Lake is located in Dahinda. Geography The town sits on the west bank of the Spoon River in a low valley with hills surrounding the town to the north and south. Mike Svob, in his book Paddling Illinois, featured the Spoon River portion from Dahinda to Maquon as one of the \\"64 great trips by canoe and kayak\\" in Illinois. Court Creek comes in from the west and flows into the Spoon River in Dahinda. Dahinda is prone to many floods from both Court Creek and the Spoon River.

A royal legislature was first provided by the 1840 Constitution and the 1852 Constitution was the first to use the term Legislature of the Hawaiian Islands, and the first to subject the monarch to certain democratic principles. Prior to this the monarchs ruled under a Council of Chiefs ( ªAha Ali ªi).  Structure  The Legislature from 1840 to 1864 was bicameral and originally consisted of a lower House of Representatives and an upper House of Nobles as provided for under the Constitutions of the Kingdom of 1840 and 1852, until abolished by the 1864 Constitution which then provided for a unicameral Legislature.  House of Nobles  The members of the upper House of Nobles (Hale  ªAha ª≈çlelo Ali ªi) were appointed by the Monarch with the advice of his Privy Council. It also served as the court of impeachment for any royal official. Members were usually Hawaiian ali ªis, nobles, and royal or wealthy individuals. The position had no salary. It originally consisted of the King or Queen plus five women and ten men. After the overthrow of the Kingdom and the subsequent United States annexation in 1898, this body was reconstituted as a Senate under the territorial constitution of the Territory of Hawaii.  House of Representatives  The members of the lower House of Representatives (Hale  ªAha ª≈çlelo Maka ªƒÅinana) were elected by popular vote from several districts in the Kingdom. Revenue-oriented bills were issued through the House of Representatives, and it also served as the \\"grand inquest\\" of the Kingdom.  History  From 1840 to 1864, it existed as a bicameral parliament. However, with the 1864 Constitution, the Legislature was temporarily unified into a single-house (unicameral) legislature. This Constitution also created property and literacy requirements for both Legislature members and voters; these requirements were later repealed by the Legislature in 1874 during the reign of King Lunalilo. The subsequent 1887 Constitution restored the two chambers as a bicameral legislature and made the revived upper House of Nobles elected to six-year terms, with higher property ownership requirements. After 1893, and the Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom, it became the Legislature of the brief Republic of Hawaii, followed in 1898 by the Territory of Hawaii after the American annexation. This was followed 61 years later by the present Hawaii State Legislature in 1959 after the admission to the Union of the Territory as the 50th State. It now consists of the lower Hawaii House of Representatives and upper house of the Hawaii Senate as the bicameral legislative body of the State of Hawaii under the 1959 Hawaii Admission Act and Constitution.

Advanced elements of the 200th Division arrived at Toungoo on March 8, 1942 and took over defensive positions from the British forces. The city of Toungoo itself would be the main defensive position of the Chinese forces, with an outpost a few kilometers to the south at Oktwin. Major-General Dai Anlan the divisional commander, sent the Motorized Cavalry Regiment and 1st Company, 598th Infantry Regiment to the banks of the Kan River 35 miles south of Toungoo and 12 miles south of the town of Pyu. The cavalry regiment plus a company of infantry pushed up to Kan River, with a platoon of cyclists taking up positions at the bridge over the river. At first light on March 18, about 200 Japanese reconnaissance troops from the 143rd Regiment of the 55th Division advanced right up to the bridge on motorbikes. Reaching the outposts they were ambushed by the Chinese troops hiding along the sides of the road. Chinese armoured cars joined the attack and after three hours of fighting the Japanese fell back, leaving some 30 dead behind together with some twenty rifles, two light machine guns and some 19 motorbikes. After night fell, the Japanese continued their attacks with small units, and the Chinese covering force fell back toward their line at Oktwin.

He was at one time a feared , later becoming an accomplished tournament pro, having won or placed in numerous competitions. He was ranked fifth in the world by the Pro Billiards Tour (PBT) in 1996.City Pages LLC (2007). Rack 'em up by David Schimke (September 9, 1998). Retrieved on August 8, 2007. Early years The son of Jimmy, Sr., the owner of a painting business, and Janice Wetch, a switchboard operator, he has one sibling, Sharon, who is four years his junior. His early life was characterized by instability. Wetch's parents divorced when he was 9, remarried when he was 17, and again divorced after a short time. Wetch would sometimes live with one parent, and sometimes with the other, or both when they were together, and each of his parents moved a number of times, though always in or around the Twin Cities area. Wetch never went to the same school for more than two years in a row. \\"It still probably affects me,\\" said Wetch in a 1999 interview, \\"To this day I'm not very good at interacting with people.\\" At a young age, Wetch became fascinated with gambling, so much so that his mother threatened to enter him in Gamblers Anonymous. He pitched coins, played cards, bet on sports, and even on pinball. His other gambling pursuits tapered off when he discovered a pool table at 13 while playing cards in a friend's basement. Wetch was soon hooked, spending as much time as possible in a local pool room called the Rack & Cue, playing eight ball and nine ball for 20 cents a game or more. He earned free table time by recording high scores on the room's video games.MN Billiards.com (2007). Interview with Jimmy \\"The Kid\\" Wetch. Retrieved on August 8, 2007. Wetch's talent was quickly evident: A month after taking up the sport he was already beating his father who was a decent recreational player. Pool became his passion. He would practice his at the kitchen table, attempting to keep his stroke perfectly level by passing it through a hollowed-out cube of pool chalk without touching the sides, and stain his father's towels wiping down the of his cue stick. Every night after completing his homework, he would head to the pool room to practice. He was known there for pestering all the better players for tips to improve his game. By 15 years of age, Wetch had 50 balls at straight pool, calling each shot in advance, as is mandatory in the game. At 16, he posted a run of 131 balls, and at 17 he won the 1985 Minnesota State Championship. Wetch had theretofore been a decent student, but pool had become all he thought about. He soon dropped out of St. Paul's Humboldt High School, to take up the life of a . He set off with a family friend, one Joe Saad, who acted as his on the road. By that time, he had already earned the nickname, \\"The Kid\\", given to him by a manager of Minnesota Billiards, one of the pool rooms in which Wetch had cut his teeth. On the road Wetch kept at the for a number of years. Joe Saad would back him with thousands of dollars, sometimes accompanying him on his trips, and sometimes not. Wetch was soon playing matches for huge stakes; Up to $10,000 bet on a single . In addition to Saad, Wetch was fostered by others such as veteran road player Jack Cooney, a hustler who often went under the assumed name George Carlson and was twenty years Wetch's senior. \\"He taught me how to survive out there, to be patient for decent games and to manage my money right.\\" However, Wetch's love for gambling and for pool did not translate into a love of the hustle. He did it because it was the only way he knew how to make money doing what he loved, but he never liked \\"the , the moving, the mismatches, the phony names.\\" > \\"I never felt good about the hustling. No matter how much money I made at > it, I knew I didn't want to keep doing it. Frankly, when no one knows how > you play, it's like putting a gun to someone's head. It wasn't a matter of > whether you were going to win, but how much you were going to win, Early on, > you make money everywhere you go. Then it all disappears.\\" > - Wetch, in Billiards Digest (1999) The event that finally took him off the road came in Houston in 1993. He had made a large score playing high-stakes pool one night. The following morning while attempting to leave his hotel room with his then-girlfriend, two men shoved the two back into the room and at gunpoint demanded the money he had won. Not satisfied with the amount of money Wetch handed over, they placed a bag over his head and beat him. Though he escaped the ordeal with only minor injuries, he promised himself he would only make one more road trip to gather a stake, and then he would quit. He made that final trip and used the money to open up a pool room with partner David Wagner, Jimmy's Pro Billiards in Columbia Heights, Minnesota. The following year, in 1994, he took the ultimate step for a road player, shucking aside his anonymity by going pro. Turning pro In his first pro event, the 1994 Super Billiards Expo in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, he finished third, knocked out by the ultimate winner, dominant pro Mike Sigel with a score of 9 to 8. Later that year he took first place at the McDermott Masters and was ranked sixteenth in the world by the PBT and named their rookie of the year. In 1995 he won the Huebler Cup and in 1996 a major tour stop at Great Gorge, New Jersey, as well as three second-place finishes at tour events, including a tense 8-6 loss in the finals of the 1996 Camel World 9-ball Championship at the hand of the Magician, Efren Reyes. His PBT rank increased that year to fifth in the world. Despite his success on the pro tour, Wetch couldn't make enough money on tournament purses alone. He said in a 1999 interview: \\"Back in 1996, I thought this game was going somewhere. We were on TV, we were making pretty good money. I was proud to be a pool player back then ... [but now] I'm just going to put more effort and time into my room.... The bottom line is, you gotta make money to survive. I don't want to be another statistic.\\" Today Wetch lives in Eagan, Minnesota, not far from his pool room. Wetch remains an active player at professional pool events but has not broken into the top ten since his high finish in 1996. In 2006 he was selected as one of 150 players to compete on the International Pool Tour. He finished 77th in the rankings, earning a total of $15,000 in prize funds. Wetch is currently sponsored by Sch√∂n cues.

The dirty bit is set when the processor writes to (modifies) this memory. The bit indicates that its associated block of memory has been modified and has not been saved to storage yet. When a block of memory is to be replaced, its corresponding dirty bit is checked to see if the block needs to be written back to secondary memory before being replaced or if it can simply be removed. Dirty bits are used by the CPU cache and in the page replacement algorithms of an operating system. Dirty bits can also be used in Incremental computing by marking segments of data that need to be processed or have yet to be processed. This technique can be used with delayed computing to avoid unnecessary processing of objects or states that have not changed. When the model is updated (usually by multiple sources), only the segments that need to be reprocessed will be marked dirty. Afterwards, an algorithm will scan the model for dirty segments and process them, marking them as clean. This ensures the unchanged segments are not recalculated and saves processor time.  Page replacement  When speaking about page replacement, each page may have a modify bit associated with it in the hardware. The dirty bit for a page is set by the hardware whenever any word or byte in the page is written into, indicating that the page has been modified. When we select a page for replacement, we examine its modify bit. If the bit is set, we know that the page has been modified since it was read in from the disk. In this case, we must write that page to the disk. If the dirty bit is not set, however, the page has not been modified since it was read into memory. Therefore, if the copy of the page on the disk has not been overwritten (by some other page, for example), then we can avoid writing the memory page to the disk: it is already there.

In February 1996, the San Jose Clash of Major League Soccer (MLS) selected Holocher in the fifth round (forty-eighth overall) of the league's Inaugural Player Draft. In April 1996 Holcher injured his knee and did not play again until the post-season. He played in five more games and scored one goal for the Clash. Holocher began the 1997 season with the Clash, but they waived him on April 10, 1997. Holocher returned to the Jaguars, now known as the California Jaguars. In 1998, the Chicago Fire of MLS picked Holocher in the second round (sixteenth overall) of the Supplemental Draft but did not sign him. National team In 1996, the national team players went on strike just prior to a game in Peru. Holocher was called into the U.S. national team for the game, a 4‚Äì1 loss to Peru on October 16, 1996. Holocher was a second-half substitute for Ted Eck at forward. Coaching In 1999, Holocher entered the coaching ranks both at the collegiate and the youth soccer levels. He founded the Catalyst Soccer Club that year and coached in the Premier Futbol Club of Santa Cruz County. In 1999, the University of California, Santa Cruz (UC Santa Cruz) also hired Holocher as its NCAA Division III men's soccer coach. In January 2006, Holocher left UC Santa Cruz to become the head coach at NCAA Division I Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. In his eight seasons at UC Santa Cruz, Holocher compiled a 109‚Äì24‚Äì8 record. He also took the Slugs to the 2004 Division III championship game where his team lost 4‚Äì0 to Messiah. In 2004, Holocher was inducted into the Santa Clara University Athletic Hall of Fame. Recently he was hired as a youth coach at the U-18 level for the San Jose Earthquakes, his former team. Source He resigned from Cal Poly in August 2014. He spent years working with the San Jose Earthquakes Academy for 3 years before joining the Houston Dynamo Academy in July of 2018 as the Academy Director.

Founded by brothers Ron and Mark Hanson in Wellington, New Zealand, in 2004, as a quasi political manifesto, copies of the first issue were produced on a photocopier, wrapped in Christmas paper and hurled anonymously through the entrances of businesses throughout the city. Now a magazine featuring interviews, writing on art, new music, history and politics, White Fungus takes a dialogical approach to the work it covers. The name of the publication comes from a can of ‚Äúwhite fungus‚Äù the Hansons found in their local supermarket in the industrial zone of Taichung City. Each cover of White Fungus is derived from a scan of the can. White Fungus has held interdisciplinary art events at galleries and venues including P.P.O.W. (New York), Kadist Art Foundation (San Francisco), N.K. (Berlin), The Lab (San Francisco), Taipei Contemporary Art Center, the Cube (Taipei), Treasure Hill (Taipei), VT Artsalon (Taipei), ARTSPACE (Auckland), Waikato Museum (Hamilton), Adam Art Gallery (Wellington), Enjoy Public Gallery(Wellington), and The Physics Room(Christchurch). The publication is held in library collections including The Museum of Modern Art (New York), The New York Public Library (Art & Architecture Collection), The Southbank Centre (London), Museu d‚ÄôArt Contemporani de Barcelona, Taipei Fine Art Museum, School of the Art Institute of Chicago, National Library of Australia and Te Papa Tongarewa (National Museum of New Zealand). The magazine has included articles by notable New Zealand art writers and artists, including Tao Wells. White Fungus was part of the exhibition Millennium Magazines at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2012. The exhibition was a survey of magazines made by contemporary artists since 2000. In November, 2012, White Fungus founders Ron Hanson and Mark Hanson gave a talk about the history of White Fungus at Times Museum in Guangzhou, China. In 2013 White Fungus was the magazine in residence at Kadist Art Foundation in San Francisco. While in the Bay Area, White Fungus released its 13th issue with events at Kadist and the Lab. The issue includes an article entitled 'The First Woman on Mars', written by American writer and independent scholar Ron Drummond. In late 2013 White Fungus signed a worldwide distribution deal with WhiteCirc in London.

Early years  Bailey was the son of Eli and Olive Bailey and the grandson of Joseph Forbes. He was raised in American Fork, Utah until the age of 13 when his father went to Grant's Pass, Oregon to take part in the building of a new sugar beet-processing factory for the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company. As Eli helped build the factory, he sent letters and money home, finally persuading his family to join him. The family did not stay in Oregon long. Utah-Idaho failed to persuade local farmers to pick up the new crop and, two summers later, Eli was put in charge of dismantling the factory and loading it upon rail cars for reassembly in Yakima Valley, Washington. The family, which had always been poor, grew more impoverished with each move, and the Yakima venture did not pull them out. The factory was not reassembled in time for the first year's (bumper) crop, and before the second year's crop could be processed, World War I ended, dropping sugar prices to what Bailey would later describe as \\"catastrophic lows\\". The lowered prices were accompanied by a disease called \\"curly top\\" which reduced the previously enormous Washington yields to industry-killing scarcity. The Bailey family responded to the death of sugar with a disastrous attempt at potato farming in Washington, after which young Bailey ran away, back home to American Fork, where he set up residence with his maternal grandfather Joseph Barlow Forbes and his first wife‚ÄîBailey's grandmother‚ÄîNancy. Living with them meant Bailey was not allowed to drop out of school and work as he had intended. A year after his return to American Fork, his mother and his siblings also returned. Elie moved to Idaho Falls, Idaho to be foreman at a UISC factory there. Although Eli sent checks to his family, Bailey finally did drop out of school to help support his mother, who would soon divorce Eli, at which point Bailey left home for good with a move to Salt Lake City. Supporting himself with odd jobs, Bailey put himself through Henager's Business College and LDS Business College. While working at the county hospital as a night orderly, Bailey met Evelyn Robison. Shortly after impulsively kissing her and getting slapped in return, he moved to California and she returned to her hometown due to illness.  Early writing career  Shortly after arriving in Los Angeles, Bailey began work as an apprentice typographer. While working in newspapers, he remet Robison, who was working again at becoming a registered nurse. They were soon married, which resulted in her expulsion from General Hospital's School of Nursing. It was the eve of the Great Depression. Evelyn undertook secretarial training at Metropolitan College. Bailey's typographic work kept him busy and well employed throughout the Depression. However, he had developed a desire to write. He fed that need initially with fact-based, usually historical articles, including a serialized study of Samuel Brannan, published in the LDS periodicals Era and Millennial Star, and, later, with much success, in book form. This began a string of successes with Church-owned publications, such as his novel For This My Glory; about the Mormon Battalion. His books were popular in Utah and even used as Sunday School texts. Meanwhile, he had taken reporting jobs at the Los Angeles Record and Hollywood Citizen, followed by a sudden opportunity to purchase the Eagle Rock Advertiser, one of two newspapers in Eagle Rock, a small town outside of Los Angeles. The paper was on the verge of collapse, but since he had both editorial and typographical preparation, Bailey was able to keep costs down and eventually turn the Advertiser into Eagle Rock's premier paper. Evelyn, for her part, drummed up additional advertising revenue.  World War II  World War II brought on serious paper-rationing with smaller newspapers were powerless to work around. While larger LA-area papers were able to purchase Canadian pulp mills to keep in paper, smaller papers were forced to print fewer pages less frequently. The Baileys were particularly frustrated because during those boom years, the advertising available was much more than they had paper to print upon. To supplement income, Bailey took a job reorganizing and running the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation's Lockheed Star, printing five separate editions for the five separate factories in the Burbank area. Also during the war years, Bailey started Westernlore Press to reprint classic texts on the Western United States, whose rarity prevented most interested libraries from purchasing copies. To his surprise, this venture was eased by the War Production Board's far less stringent requirements for acquiring book paper. The books published by Westernlore‚Äîon the same presses used by the Advertiser‚Äîwere immediate successes and every edition sold out. During this time, Bailey also found time to write three new books. The first, a fictionalized version of his Samuel Brannan biography, and the second (also a novel) were \\"enthusiastically received by the Saints.\\" The third, Jacob Hamblin, Buckskin Apostle, became a source of controversy. Bailey received angry responses from LDS leadership and the Hamblin family‚Äîin large part because his book dealt with Hamblin's marriages to two Indian women and two white women, and the Mountain Meadows massacre. In later years however, Buckskin Apostle would experience a renaissance in LDS circles‚Äîeven being published by Church-owned publication. The end of the war saw larger corporations buying up impoverished smaller papers and forcing the others out of business. The Advertiser was one of the few, hardy small papers that survived the war rationing, only to be forced out of business by larger corporation shortly thereafter.  Later life  Bailey ran Westernlore until 1973, when its inventory was lost in a fire and his son Lynn moved the company to Tucson, Arizona. During the years he ran it, Westernlore continued to publish books focused on the Western United States that were highly regarded by libraries and well purchased. Westernlore published some of Bailey's own work, but his better known books were published by larger companies. Many of his later books proved, to his and his publishers' surprise, to be controversial. For instance, For Time and All Eternity‚Äîa book about the anti-polygamy crusade in the 1890s‚Äîcaused a small uproar among the Utah faithful (although, according to Samuel W. Taylor, \\"Bailey . . . [said the uproar] resulted from the objections of one man to a single passage in the book\\"), as did his book on Zion's Camp, the Missouri Contingent, the Nauvoo Legion and the Mormon Battalion‚Äî The Armies of God. Bailey believed the book was \\"a warm, honest appraisal of Mormon heroism in conquering the West\\" and his publisher had arranged for numerous interviews and signings in Utah; however, in the end the book was never so much as reviewed in the State. Although estranged in many ways from Mormonism, Bailey always embraced that part of his heritage. Evelyn died in 1981. Bailey never remarried; he died in 1987. They were buried in Fillmore, Utah. Many of his papers are held by the University of California, Los Angeles. Works     * *  References  External links  * * Paul D.

The sea was formed during the Oxfordian stage of the Late Jurassic as an extension of the rift that formed the Central Atlantic Ocean and was isolated during the Oligocene epoch (about 34 million years ago). It was separated from the Tethys Ocean to the south by the formation of the Alps, Carpathians, Dinarides, Taurus and Elburz mountains. During its long existence the Paratethys was at times reconnected with the Tethys or its successors, the Mediterranean Sea or Indian Ocean. From the Pliocene epoch onward (after 5 million years ago), the Paratethys became progressively shallower. Today's Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Aral Sea, Lake Urmia, Namak Lake and others are remnants of the Paratethys Sea. Name and research The name Paratethys was first used by Vladimir D. Laskarev in 1924. Laskarev's definition included only fossils and sedimentary strata from the sea of the Neogene system. This definition was later adjusted to also include the Oligocene series. The existence of a separated water body in these periods was deduced from fossil fauna (most importantly molluscs, fish and ostracods). In periods in which the Paratethys or parts of it were separated from each other or from other oceans, a separate fauna developed which is found in sedimentary deposits. In this way the paleogeographical development of the Paratethys can be studied. Sedimentary strata from the Paratethys are difficult to correlate with those from other oceans or seas because at times it was totally separated from them. Stratigraphers of the Paratethys therefore have their own sets of stratigraphic stages which are still used as alternatives for the official geologic timescale of the ICS. Paleogeographical development Paratethys realm at 17‚Äì13 mya. The Paratethys spread over a large area in Central Europe and western Asia. In the west it included in some stages the Molasse basin north of the Alps; further east the Vienna Basin and the Pannonian Basin; the basin of the current Black Sea; and from there it spread eastward until the current position of the Aral Sea. During the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, this part of Eurasia was covered by shallow seas that formed the northern margins of the Tethys Ocean. However, because Anatolia, the southern boundary of the Paleo-Tethys, is a part of the original Cimmerian continent, the last remnant of Paleo-Tethys Ocean might be oceanic crust under the Black Sea. The Tethys Ocean formed between Laurasia (Eurasia and North America) and Gondwana (Africa, India, Antarctica, Australia and South America) when the supercontinent Pangea broke up during the Triassic (200 million years ago). The boundary between the Eocene and Oligocene epochs was characterized by a big drop of the global (eustatic) sea level and a sudden steep cooling of global climates. At the same time the Alpine orogeny, a tectonic phase by which the Alps, Carpathians, Dinarides, Taurus, Elburz and many other mountain chains along the southern rim of Eurasia were formed. The combination of a drop in sea level and tectonic uplift resulted in a large regression of the sea and a barrier was formed between the Tethys and Paratethys domains. Connections with the Arctic Ocean (the Turgai Sea), the North Sea Basin and Atlantic Ocean (in the form of a strait north of the Carpathians) also closed in the Early Oligocene. However, it is possible connections with the Rh√¥negraben (and the Mediterranean) and the Hessen Strait (that connected the Molasse Basin with the North Sea Basin) still kept open. The Early Miocene (around 20 million years ago) saw a phase of marine transgression. During this period the Paratethys was well connected with the Mediterranean again. This trend was reversed halfway in the Miocene, and parts of the Paratethys were often separated from each other. When parts of the Mediterranean fell dry during the Messinian salinity crisis (about 6 million years ago) there were phases when Paratethys water flowed into the deep Mediterranean basins. During the Pliocene epoch (5.33 to 2.58 million years ago) the former Paratethys was divided into a couple of inland seas that were at times completely separated from each other. An example was the Pannonian Sea, a brackish sea in the Pannonian Basin. Many of these would disappear before the start of the Pleistocene. At present, only the Black Sea, Caspian Sea and Aral Sea remain of what was once a vast inland sea.

The information contained in NASD was contributed by safety professionals and organizations from across the United States. Specifically, the objectives of the NASD project are: 1) to provide a national resource for the dissemination of information; 2) to educate workers and managers about occupational hazards associated with agriculture-related injuries, deaths and illnesses; 3) to provide prevention information; 4) to promote the consideration of safety and health issues in agricultural operations; and 5) to provide a convenient way for members of the agricultural safety and health community to share educational and research materials with their colleagues. History of NASD The original concept of NASD was a deliverable collection of safety materials contained within CD-ROMs, where the updates on CD would be periodically released. In October 1993, NIOSH provided funding through its Agricultural Health Promotion System (AHPS) grant program to develop the first CD-ROM NASD through the University of Florida's Cooperative Extension Service(CES). The first prototype of the CD-ROM collection was delivered to a select group of reviewers in October 1994, containing materials from institutions participating in the AHPS grant and from elsewhere. Reviewers provided their suggestions in a March 1995 workshop, and the general release occurred in June of the same year. The Information Technology program associated with Florida CES was developing tools to deliver Extension publications electronically through the internet, and in October 1996, NIOSH funded a three-year program to update the database and convert the database into HTML format for delivery on the World-Wide Web. By October 1997, the entire database had been converted and a web-site was established. Expansion of the database continued, and CD-ROMs of the content were also produced during 1997(NASD'97), 1998(NASD '98), and 1999(NASD '99). In 2001, NIOSH funded the program to expand and maintain NASD. In 2002, The Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (USDA-CREES) added funding support for NASD. In 2002-2006, NIOSH funded NASD through the Southern Coastal Ag Center (SCAC). Dr. Carol Lehtola directed the project. In 2007-2009, NIOSH funded NASD through the University of Florida ‚Äì again, Dr. Lehtola directed the project. After a 4-year hiatus, in 2013 NIOSH resumed support for NASD with funding through the Central States Center for Agricultural Safety and Health (CSCASH), the Southeast Center for Agricultural Health and Injury Prevention (SCAHIP), and the High Plains Intermountain Center for Agricultural Health and Safety (HICAHS).

Fidelis was a Greek who was hired out by his parents to a merchant venture to Spain in the mid sixth century, arriving in M√©rida, where his mother's brother, Paul, was bishop.Thompson, The Goths in Spain, 22. As it was customary of merchants to greet the bishop with gifts upon their arrival, it is not surprising that Paul discovered his nephew on one of these trading missions.Collins, M√©rida and Toledo, in James, 202. Paul had amassed a large fortune which by law he was obligated to give to the diocese, but which he kept for himself. He consecrated Fidelis as his successors and forced the clergy to accept this by threatening to bequeath his wealth to others if Fidelis was not his successor.Thompson, The Goths in Spain, 44. Fidelis was willed the private wealth and when public opposition tried to force him to abandon taking up his see, he threatened to remove his inherited wealth. He was consequently accepted as bishop. With the immense wealth he had at his disposal and M√©rida the richest diocese in Spain, Fidelis went about repairing the buildings of the city, restoring the collapsed episcopal palace -- and decorating lavishly with marble -- and reconstructing the basilica of Saint Eulalia with two added towers.Collins, Visigothic Spain, 213-214; Id, M√©rida and Toledo, 194.

Scott Norton, having recently seen his tag team Fire and Ice (with Ice Train) break up, had been doing very little. WCW President Eric Bischoff had recently been outed as the man behind the New World Order, and he extended an ultimatum to the WCW roster: Join the nWo, or be targeted by it. Norton and Bagwell were two of the wrestlers that answered the call, Bagwell turning on Riggs in the process. The team Vicious and Delicious fought mainly in the midcards against the nWo's enemies. They were usually accompanied to the ring by the nWo \\"Head of Security\\" Vincent, and often teamed with Konnan, another nWo midcarder. They fought with The Steiner Brothers, but they were never able to win the tag team titles. The tag title scene in WCW was dominated by a feud between The Steiner Brothers and the Outsiders through most of 1997 and 1998, and as The Outsiders and Vicious and Delicious were teammates in the nWo, there was little room for Vicious and Delicious to advance in the division. As Scott Norton was splitting his time between WCW and New Japan Pro Wrestling, the tag team was inactive as often as not, with Bagwell wrestling singles while Norton was in Japan. Breakup On the April 22, 1998 episode of WCW Thunder, Bagwell was severely injured by a flying bulldog off the top rope from Rick Steiner. With Bagwell injured, the team was quietly dropped. Norton would spend the rest of his WCW career mainly winning squash matches in the lower midcard, while Bagwell, once recovered, moved on to team with Scott Steiner.

His life is known only from the Chronica Gallica of 511. He was sent by his father to Gaul with a powerful army, accompanied by three generals -- Thorisarius, Everdingus, and Hermianus -- in order to oppose the Visigoths then occupying Provence and threatening to conquer the Auvergne. He and his generals were defeated by the Visigothic king Euric near Arles and all four of them lost their lives. The Chronica, in entry 649, states: > Antimolus a patre Anthemio imperatore cum Thorisario, Everdingo et Hermiano > com. stabuli Arelate directus est, quibus rex Euricus trans Rhodanum > occurrit occisisque ducibus omnia vastavit Antimolus was sent by his father, > Emperor Anthemius, to Arles, with Thorisarius, Everdingus and Hermanius, > comes [or comites] stabuli: King Euric met them on the far side of the Rhone > and, having killed the duces, laid everything waste.* Barnwell, P.S. \\"3. The > Imperial Court\\" According to the Chronica, this event falls between the succession of Euric (467) and the war between Anthemius and Ricimer (471-472). It can probably be further narrowed to the period when Anthemius is known to have been organising a concerted effort to remove the Visigoths from Gaul between 468 and 471, a period during which an army led by the Briton Riothamus was defeated near D√©ols. It is not impossible that Anthemiolus' army was sent to reinforce Riothamus and that Euric defeated both forces in turn, probably in either 470 or 471.

Like the chronicle of 452, it was written in the south of Gaul, possibly at Arles or Marseille. The sources of its author include the earlier chronicle, the chronicle of Sulpicius Severus, that of Hydatius, that of Orosius, and the imperial consular records.

The chronicle covers the period from 379 to 509/511, from which derives its name. Its entries are short and pointed, but only (approximately) datable by the rare reference to the regnal year of an emperor and by the (assumed) chronological ordering of events. Among the events for which there is no other extant source is the defeat and death of Anthemiolus around 471.

In Iran, the Persian names of the zodiac are used while in Afghanistan the original Arabic names are used. It gains approximately 1 day on the Julian calendar every 128 years. The tropical Jalali calendar (), which inherited some aspects from the Yazdgerdi calendar, was adopted on 15 March 1079 by the Seljuk Sultan Jalal al-Din Malik Shah I (for whom it was named), based on the recommendations of a committee of astronomers, including Omar Khayyam, at the imperial observatory in his capital city of Isfahan. Month computations were based on solar transits through the zodiac. It remained in use for eight centuries. It arose out of dissatisfaction with the seasonal drift in the Islamic calendar which is due to that calendar being lunar instead of solar; a lunar year of 354 days, while acceptable to a desert nomad people, proved to be unworkable for settled, agricultural peoples, and the Iranian calendar is one of several non-lunar calendars adopted by settled Muslims for agricultural purposes (others include the Coptic calendar, the Julian calendar, and the Semitic calendars of the Near East). Sultan Jalal commissioned the task in 1073. Its work was completed well before the Sultan's death in 1092, after which the observatory would be abandoned. The year was computed from the March equinox (Nowruz), and each month was determined by the transit of the sun into the corresponding zodiac region, a system that incorporated improvements on the fourth-century-CE Indian system of the Surya Siddhanta (Surya=solar, Siddhanta=analysis), also the basis of most Hindu calendars. Since the solar transit times can have 24-hour variations, the length of the months vary slightly in different years (each month can be between 29 and 32 days). For example, the months in the two last years of the Jalali calendar had: * 1303 AP: 30, 31, 32, 31, 32, 30, 31, 30, 29, 30, 29, and 30 days, * 1302 AP: 30, 31, 32, 31, 31, 31, 31, 29, 30, 29, 30, and 30 days. Because months were computed based on precise times of solar transit between zodiacal regions, seasonal drift never exceeded one day, and also there was no need for a leap year in the Jalali calendar. However, this calendar was very difficult to compute; it required full ephemeris computations and actual observations to determine the apparent movement of the Sun. Some claim that simplifications introduced in the intervening years may have introduced a system with eight leap days in every cycle of 33 years. (Different rules, such as the 2820-year cycle, have also been accredited to Khayyam). However, the original Jalali calendar based on observations (or predictions) of solar transit would not have needed either leap years or seasonal adjustments. Owing to the variations in month lengths, and also the difficulty in computing the calendar itself, the Iranian calendar was modified to simplify these aspects in 1925 (1304 AP), resulting in the Solar Hijri calendar.

Carezani is best known for proposing the theory of autodynamics, which aimed to formulate a mathematical basis of Einstein's theories of special and general relativity. Biography Dr. Carezani was born in the city of C√≥rdoba, to an Italian activist and quiet mother. At the age of 10, he moved to Tucum√°n, where he completed his primary, secondary and university studies. He studied electro-mechanical engineering at the National University of Tucum√°n and formulated the first draft of his theory Autodynamics at age 24. He graduated in 1947 with a Ph. D. Much of his further life has been devoted to his improvements on his theory, though some have proven to be controversial or even proven fallacious. He moved to Buenos Aires in 1953 and married an elementary school teacher. During this time period, he succeeded to publish his research in an important newspaper in Buenos Aires. However, this was shunned from the viewpoint of the Peron government who had close links to traditional relativists. For the next twenty years, he started his own mechanical engineering corporation and occasionally altered his theory. In 1966, the mafia asked Carezani to offer the government 1/4 of his earnings. However, Carezani refused and sought to make a difference internationally. That time came in 1979 when Argentina lessened its travel restrictions, and was encouraged by his colleagues to conduct research internationally. That year, he moved with his family Long Beach, California, USA. Carezani worked with Pierre Noyes at various linear accelerators, and conducted further lab work in MIT and the University of Barcelona. However, importantly, while some of the theories were proven true, many were proven false through the experiments conducted at the Stanford Linear Accelerator. However, after the setbacks in the 1980s, Carezani regained some prominence in the 1990s and 2000s. In 1991, he discovered a mathematical conversion theorizing that special relativity is a subset of autodynamics. Despite a heart transplant in 1992 stopping any research for the next year, Carezani regained momentum and founded the Society of the Advancement of Autodynamics, a California-Based organization now run by David De Hilster. In 1996, Carezani was presented the \\"Lifetime Achievement Award\\" in relative physics, and he published his first book one year later. Today, Carezani has mostly retired his formal laboratory work. He continues to compile his findings into books and display his theory on television documentaries. Critics There are a number of critics of autodynamics. For example, Mark Norris has devoted much time to pointing out the more obvious flaws with autodynamics. Other examples of objections to Autodynamics dating back to the early 1990s can be found on various physics forums, one such argument is provided by Tom Roberts in his \\"A Physicist's Refutation of Autodynamics\\" Selected publications * Nucleus- Nucleus Collision and Autodynamics (Physics Essays Vol. 10, 1997 DOI: 10.4006/1.3028710 ) * Calorimetric Test of Special Relativity (with Dieter R.

Desautels was a light-hitting player, but was known for his superior defensive ability as a catcher, and for his handling pitching staffs. After his playing career, he served as a manager in minor league baseball. Playing career Born in Worcester, Massachusetts, to French Canadian parents, Desautels was a prot√©g√© of Crusaders coach Jack Barry during his playing days at the College of the Holy Cross. After graduating with a bachelor's degree in philosophy, he went directly to the major leagues, making his debut with the Detroit Tigers on June 22, 1930 at the age of 23. He served as a reserve catcher for the Detroit Tigers, playing behind Ray Hayworth and veteran Muddy Ruel. When catcher Mickey Cochrane joined the Tigers as a player-manager in 1934, Desautels was sent to the minor leagues to play for the Toledo Mud Hens. He then spent two seasons in the Pacific Coast League with the Hollywood Stars and San Diego Padres. Desautels came back to the major leagues in 1937, playing for the Boston Red Sox as a back up to Rick Ferrell. When Ferrell was traded to the Washington Senators in June of that same year, Desautels became the starting catcher for the Red Sox. Desautels enjoyed his most productive season with Boston in 1938, when he posted career- highs in batting average (.291), home runs (2), runs batted in (48), runs (47), doubles (16), and games played (108). However, his offensive performance diminished in 1939 and, he would be traded to the Cleveland Indians for Frankie Pytlak after the 1940 season.Gene Desautels Trades and Transactions at Baseball Almanac As a member of the Indians, Desautels played as a reserve catcher behind Rollie Hemsley. At the beginning of the 1943 season, Indians' manager, Lou Boudreau, named Desautels as the Indians starting catcher, but by the middle of the year he was replaced by Buddy Rosar, who was hitting above .300. He entered the United States Marine Corps in February 1944 and was discharged in July 1945 at the age of 38, losing two years from his baseball career. He rejoined the Indians in August 1945 but, saw little playing time and was released in September of that year. He was hired by Connie Mack to play for the Philadelphia Athletics in 1946, where he once again played as a reserve catcher behind Buddy Rosar. Desautels retired as a player at the end of the season, at the age of 39. Joe Cronin, the former American League President, was once asked if he had ever seen a player win an argument or an umpire change his decision. Cronin said, \\"Gene Desautels, then a rookie, young catcher with Detroit, was a cocky young fellow and was giving umpire Cal Hubbard a hard time. On a play at second, Desautels slid in and Hubbard called him out as he peered through a cloud of dust. I think Hubbard was hoping Desautels would complain so he could throw him out of the game, too.

Lady initially goes to work for Fallin, then quits and sets out on her own when he tries to \\"help\\" her by providing a crooked dealer. Longtime admirer and bookie Charlie Lang proposes to her, but it is persistent young Garry Madison, who wins her heart despite unknowingly bringing two policemen in disguise to the illegal gambling den where she is playing.

Stretched along US 209, the hamlet includes one of the finest concentrations of colonial Dutch architecture in the United States. Settled by the Dutch in the 17th century, its architecture has retained the influence of that period. The village is also historically significant as a temporary home of the seat of New York government during the American Revolutionary War. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961. Description and history Hurley is a small town located on the edge of the Catskill Mountains west of Kingston in the Hudson River Valley. Its main village lines both sides of US 209, which bisects the community, and extends along Wynkoop Road, Main Street and Hurley Mountain Road at the boundary of the Catskill Park. The village includes a collection of stone and frame structures, many dating from the 18th century. Ten of these are good examples of Dutch Colonial architecture, while the other buildings contribute to its ambience as an 18th-century village. Included in the historic district are the town cemetery, where its early settlers are buried, and the surrounding farmland. Originally settled by the Dutch and called Nieuw Dorp (\\"New Village\\"), it came under English control soon thereafter although its inhabitants continued to speak Dutch and preserve other aspects of that culture for at least another century. Hurley is also historically important both for its role in the American Revolutionary War. The newly formed New York state government moved here for two months in late 1777 while Kingston was being rebuilt. The British Army had burned it in retaliation for the creation of the state there (Albany, New York's traditional capital, was under threat of attack by a large army led by General John Burgoyne). It is thus the second of the state's three capital cities.

Benson, Henrietta Mears & How She Did It, (Glendale, California:Regal, Division of G/L Publications, 1966) Best known as the innovative and dynamic Director of Christian Education at First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, California and in charge of the college and young adult people in the mid 1900s, she built a dedicated, enthusiastic staff, trained and mentored her teachers and implemented a graded, age-appropriate curriculum from ‚Äúcradle roll‚Äù to adults. Henrietta lectured and wrote passionately about Sunday school‚Äôs power to teach others the Bible. Within two years Sunday School attendance at Hollywood ‚ÄúPres‚Äù was averaging more than 4,200 per week. She served in leading the Sunday School program from 400 to 6500. Henrietta Mears taught the college age program herself. Henrietta Mears was one of the most influential Christian leaders of the 20th Century. She founded , a publishing company for many of her training materials, Forest Home, a Christian conference center nestled in a wooded setting of California's coastal range, and , and profoundly impacted the ministries of Bill Bright and Vonette Zachary Bright (Campus Crusade), Jim Rayburn (Young Life) and Billy Graham (Billy Graham Evangelistic Association) and Louis Evans, Jr. who was the organizing pastor of Bel Air Church (where Ronald Reagan and many other stars attended) and led the congregation of the National Presbyterian Church, Washington, D.C. with her emphasis on Scripture and a clear Gospel message for young people. Mears is believed by many theologians to have most directly shaped Bill Bright‚Äôs Four Spiritual Laws, which defined modern evangelism in the 20th century. She was a gifted educator and was known as \\"Teacher\\" by those in her program. Her book, ,\\" has sold over three million copies. Literally hundreds of men and womenBaldwin & Benson, p. 142, quoting a letter to her from Dr. Harold John Ockenga, first president of Fuller Seminary in Psadena came out of her Sunday School program into full- time Christian service, including 1st Presbyterian Hollywood's Louis Evans, Sr.'s son; Louis H. Evans, Jr. (Colleen Townsend Evans), who became the organizing pastor of Bel Air Presbyterian church; Bill Bright and his wife Vonette Zachary Bright, founder of Campus Crusade for Christ, which lived in and worked out of Henrietta's house for 10 years; Billy Graham; Reverend L.

Early life Henrietta Cornelia Mears was born on October 23, 1890, in Fargo, North Dakota, the seventh child of banker E. Ashley Mears and Baptist laywoman Margaret Burtis Everts, whose father had been an influential Chicago pastor. Already 42 when Henrietta arrived, Margaret died when her youngest daughter was only 20. (An obituary tribute said, \\"as a Bible teacher she had few equals in the city of Minneapolis\\"). Henrietta's father, E. Ashley Mears was the President of First Bank of North Dakota and sold mortgages to private investors. At the height of his business, he owned approximately 20 banks. Originally wealthy, the Mears family lost most of their money in the Panic of 1893 and re-settled in Minneapolis. Here Henrietta inaugurated her early schooling by announcing that she was bored with kindergarten because it was \\"to amuse little children, and I'm amused enough. I want to be educated.\\" At seven years old she declared she was ready to become a Christian and joined the First Baptist Church of Minneapolis. Henrietta was troubled by poor health, contracting muscular rheumatism at age 12. Though the prayers of a family friend brought healing, she suffered from bad eyesight all her life, and her doctors advised her that if she continued her studies (she planned to enroll in the University of Minnesota) she would be blind by age 30. Her response was, \\"Then blind I shall be‚Äîbut I want something in my head to think about.\\" She graduated from University of Minnesota in 1913, still able to see, and began teaching chemistry at rural high schools. In 1915, Henrietta returned to Minneapolis to teach at Central High School and live with her sister. In Minneapolis, Henrietta attended the First Baptist Church where she was encouraged to apply educational standards to Sunday School programs. After teaching Sunday School for over a decade, in 1927, Henrietta took a sabbatical to California. While there she visited First Presbyterian Church Hollywood which had a Sunday School of 450 students. Public education might have remained Henrietta's life work if not for an encounter with Stuart MacLennan, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, who spoke at the Mears' sisters' church in Minneapolis in the 1920s. In 1927 Henrietta took a sabbatical year to consider whether she should enter Christian work full-time. She and Margaret traveled to California, where the sisters visited Dr. MacLennan's church and Henrietta spoke. Before Henrietta left, MacLennan offered her the Director of Christian Education post, and in 1928 she and Margaret moved to Hollywood.Henrietta Cornelia Mears was born on October 23, 1890, in Fargo, North Dakota, the seventh child of banker Ashley Mears and Baptist laywoman Margaret Burtis Everts, whose father had been an influential Chicago pastor.

He is a winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his work covering the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide. He serves on the board of EARTH University, in Costa Rica, and of The Markup, the New York-based investigative journalism organization focused on the impact of large tech platforms and their potential for human manipulation. He is the founder and host of Africa In the World, a hearts and minds festival held annually in Stellenbosch, in the Cape winelands of South Africa. He was a patron of the Etisalat Prize for Literature. Biography Olojede was born in January 1961 in Modakeke, Nigeria. He was the 12th of 28 children. In 1982, he began his journalism career at the National Concord in Lagos, a newspaper owned by aspiring political figure Moshood Abiola. Olojede left the paper in 1984 after he became concerned that Abiola was using the paper to advance his personal political ambitions. Olojede enrolled at the University of Lagos where he studied journalism, and became a leader of the students union movement. As a student he was particularly influenced by Nigerian literary luminaries like Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka and Cyprian Ekwensi and other African writers like Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o. He also acted Shakespeare in grade school and dabbled in poetry in Yoruba and English Olojede became one of the founding staff writers of a Nigerian news magazine called Newswatch in 1984. The magazine was edited by Dele Giwa, a well-known Nigerian journalist who was killed by a mail bomb on 19 October 1986. Olojede publicly accused Nigeria's military leader Ibrahim Babangida of being responsible for the murder. In 2001, eight years after leaving power, Babangida refused to testify before a human rights court about the murder. A 1986 investigative report by Olojede on the imprisonment of the popular Nigerian musician Fela Kuti led to Kuti's release and the dismissal of the judge who imprisoned him. In 1987, Olojede's efforts earned him a US$26,000 Ford Foundation Scholars grant which Olojede used to get a master's degree at Columbia University. At Columbia he won the Henry N. Taylor Award for outstanding foreign student. Olojede eventually became a US-Nigeria dual citizen. Newsday On 6 June 1988, Olojede joined Newsday, the Long Island- based newspaper, first as a summer intern and later as a reporter covering local news, including a stint in the Hamptons, on the East End of Long Island. He eventually became United Nations Correspondent, a perch from which he began to cover Africa, making several extended trips to the continent. He was subsequently named Africa Correspondent, based in Johannesburg, South Africa, following the release of Nelson Mandela from prison. Olojede later worked as a correspondent in China from 1996 to 1999, after being named Asia Bureau Chief, based in Beijing. His reporting took him to all but a handful of Asia countries. Following his assignment in Asia, he returned to Long Island where he became foreign editor of Newsday. In January 2004, Olojede took an opportunity to return to Africa as a correspondent to write about the 1994 Rwandan genocide, ten years later. In April 1994, when the genocide broke out in Rwanda, Olojede was covering the South African general elections, the first free elections at the end of apartheid. Olojede has said that while the South Africa story was important, he has often wondered if he could have helped the situation in Rwanda if he had gone there instead. Olojede's 2004 series on the aftermath of the Rwandan Genocide was well received. One story that drew particular attention was \\"Genocide's Child\\" about a mother who was raising a son conceived during a gang rape during the war. In 2005, Olojede won the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting for his \\"fresh, haunting look at Rwanda a decade after rape and genocidal slaughter had ravaged the Tutsi tribe.\\" The series was viewed as a major accomplishment for black journalists. Olojede was assisted by African American photographer J. Conrad Williams, and much of the series was edited by Lonnie Isabel, another African American journalist who was the assistant managing editor for national and foreign coverage. By the time he won the Pulitzer, Olojede had already left Newsday. The Tribune Company had purchased Newsday from its previous owners in 2000, and by 2004 were trying to trim costs. At the end of 2004, Newsday offered a round of buyouts. On 10 December 2004, Olojede took the buyout and moved to Johannesburg, where he was living when he learned he had won the Pulitzer. Back to Africa As of 2006, Olojede was living in Johannesburg with his wife and two daughters. In November 2006, the East African Standard reported that Olojede was hoping to launch a daily newspaper that would be distributed across the entire African continent. Returning to Nigeria, Olojede launched 234Next in 2008, first on Twitter and then online and in print. Hiring 80 new journalists fresh out of college and working out of a diesel-powered 24-hour newsroom, NEXT worked to expose government corruption in the face of much resistance. Most famously, NEXT scooped the story that the president, President Yar'Adua was secretly brain dead and not \\"returning soon from a Saudi hospital\\" as promised. In 2011, Dele Olojede won the John P. McNulty Prize,John P. McNulty Prize which was established to reward the most innovative projects driving social change created by Fellows of the Aspen Institute.Fellows of the Aspen Institute The Prize was awarded for Olojede's vision and efforts in creating NEXT in Nigeria. Under Olojede, NEXT paid its journalists a living wage, opposing the usual local practice of politicians paying journalists and expecting only favourable coverage in return. It scooped many stories of public interest, but found that advertisers would no longer support it. When it collapsed in 2011, it owed its staff more than five months' wages.Nigeria's 'brown envelope' journalism. Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani.

The building was formerly known as Woh Hup Complex. The complex contains 411 shops and 500 parking spaces. The building, much like Lucky Plaza, is largely an ethnic enclave for the Thai population in Singapore. History In 1966, the Urban Renewal Department of the Housing and Development Board was formed to facilitate greater flexibility and autonomy in comprehensive redevelopment of Singapore's Central Area. The Golden Mile Complex development was the result of the department's first Sales of Sites programme in 1967.Norman Edwards, Peter Keys (1996), Singapore - A Guide to Buildings, Streets, Places, Times BooksInternational, The \\"Golden Mile\\" refers to the strip of land between Nicoll Highway and Beach Road. It was planned by the Singapore Government as a high-rise spine fronting Kallang Basin.Wong Yunn Chii (2005), Singapore 1:1 City: A Gallery of Architecture & Urban Design, Urban Redevelopment Authority, The area used to be occupied by squatters and small marine industries. Built at a cost of S$18 million and completed in 1973, the 16-storey Golden Mile Complex is one of the early pioneers of integrating multiple operations into a single mixed-use development in Singapore. Today, the complex's shopping mall houses numerous Thai clubs, shops and eateries, as well as tourist and ticketing agencies for travellers going to Malaysia by bus or coach. A minor upgrading was carried out on the Golden Mile Complex building in 1983, when tinted glass was added to the Beach Road fa√ßade to achieve the desired overall thermal transfer value rating. In 1986, the whole building was redecorated. In March 2006, the Golden Mile Complex was described as a \\"vertical slum\\", \\"terrible eyesore\\" and \\"national disgrace\\" by Singapore Nominated Member of Parliament Ivan Png: \\"Each individual owner acts selfishly, adding extensions, zinc sheets, patched floors, glass, all without any regard for other owners and without any regard for the national welfare.\\" The residents have also done over their balconies to create an extra room. The Golden Mile Complex, which is located on a 99-year leasehold site starting from 1969, has been planned to be put up for an en bloc sale. On 11 August 2018, 80% of the owners signed an agreement agreeing to sell the complex in an en-block sale.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/golden-mile-complex-gets-more- than-80-per-cent-votes-from-owners-to-launch-en-bloc-sale Architecture The Golden Mile Complex's shopping mall in the atrium houses numerous Thai clubs, shops and eateries. Thai shops fill up most of the spaces in the complex The Golden Mile Complex is a commercial and residential development, providing offices, shopping, entertainment services and apartment living within its podium and stepped terrace structure, resulting in a modern architectural style known as Brutalism.https://issuu.com/iremembersg/docs/brutalist_architecture It houses 411 shops, 226 offices and 68 residential units. The building was designed by Gan Eng Oon, William Lim and Tay Kheng Soon of the Singapore architect firm Design Partnership, now known as DP Architects. Sited on 1.3 hectares and built to a height of 89 metres (292 feet), the Golden Mile Complex is an exemplary type of \\"megastructure\\" described by architectural historian, Reyner Banham. It is one of the few that have been actually realised in the world. Pritzker Architecture Prize laureate Fumihiko Maki had called the Golden Mile Complex a \\"collective form\\". It successfully propagates high-density usage and diversity under a broad range of ideas advanced by the Japanese Metabolist Movement of the 1960s. The complex was designed as a \\"vertical city\\", which stands in contrast to homogenised cities where functional zoning restrains all signs of the latter's vitality. Conceived as a prototype for a lively environment, the design of the Golden Mile Complex was intended to catalyse urban development along Beach Road by employing an extruded section that would stretch along the East Coast facing the sea. In terms of public transport and accessibility, the building is serviced from the rear on Beach Road, instead of its frontage with Nicoll Highway, with a continuous pedestrian spine linking all buildings in the Golden Mile of Beach Road. The design was influenced by the linear city concepts of Le Corbusier and Arturo Soria y Mata.Robert Powell (2004), Singapore Architecture, Periplus Editions, The stepped profile of the Golden Mile Complex offers the occupants of the apartments on the upper floors a panoramic view of the sea and sky. All the apartments have balconies, and two-storey maisonette penthouses crown off the building. The narrowness of this sloping slab form enhances natural ventilation and shades a lofty communal concourse above the podium along Beach Road. The stepped design also reduces the impact of noise from the road traffic. The Golden Mile Complex preceded by several years avant-garde stepped-section buildings which were built in the United Kingdom and Europe. The lower floors contain offices and a retail mall, located within staggered atria to allow natural light into the heart of the building.

First mentioned in 1242, Lengvenis was a nephew of Mindaugas (a son of his sister). Around 1245, Lengvenis led Mindaugas' armies against Volhynia and was injured near Mielnik. Dukes of neighboring lands, three brothers Gineika, Milgerinas (Milgrynas) and Tuƒçƒó (Duƒçius), grew unhappy with expanding power of Mindaugas and his clan. Just after the Volhynian campaign, they allied with the Livonian Order invaded Lengvenis' estate (believed to be in Nal≈°ia, northeastern Lithuania with the center in Ginuƒçiai Hillfort). Lengvenis and his family was captured and taken to Riga. Lengvenis' younger brother attempted to rescue them en route to Livonia, but was killed. After a ransom of 500 half groschen was paid, Lengvenis returned to his devastated estate. Lengvenis retaliated around 1247, when he successfully led a military campaign against the komtur of Cƒìsis. He defeated 500 men guarding the castle, killing the komtur and eight other knights.

The municipality is located east of the state capital in the Middle Zone, and it has the following coordinates: 99 ¬∞ 39 'W and 22 ¬∞ 00' north, with a height of 1.200 m above sea level. It is bordered to the north by Alaquines, to the east by Tamasopo, to the south by Rayon, and to the west by R√≠o Verde, and it is 200 km away from the city of San Luis Potos√≠. With a population of about 20,000 inhabitants, it is the second largest city in the Middle Zone. it is 19 km away from the town of Alaquines, San Luis Potos√≠. History The church cupola The first settlers were the friars, who occupied the ground in the first third of the seventeenth century. They occupied rancher√≠as and farms, including the huge hacienda Ci√©nega de San Nicol√°s, allegedly founded by Luis de C√°rdenas. In those years it was referred to as the Ci√©nega de San Nicol√°s and later it came to be known as the Hacienda de C√°rdenas after the surname of its owner. Origin of the city For more than a century it was owned by the C√°rdenas family. Throughout that time and years later, there was a rise in its population among families of all castes, but most were Pames and few spoke Spanish. They were not concentrated in one locale but were dispersed among several rancher√≠as, and one or two friars of the mission of Alaquines served in religious matters. In the year 1761 the Ci√©nega hacienda was owned by Don Manuel Antonio Rojo del R√≠o, Lafuente and Vieyra. When his property was confiscated and sold, it passed to the hands of F√©lix Mar√≠a Calleja and then Don Felipe Barrag√°n. Upon the death of the latter, the property passed to the ownership of his daughters, Juana and Luisa Barrag√°n. When the Mexican War of Independence began, several armed conflicts are recorded as having occurred in the territory of the C√°rdenas hacienda. In several combats are mentioned the royal forces commanded by don Cayetano Quintero and don Felipe de la Garza, and the guerilla insurgents of Desiderio Z√°rate. The Railway in Cardenas 250px In 1881 began one of the projects that would form the municipality into one of the most modern in the state, the railway. This project would include the construction of rails from San Luis Potos√≠ to Tampico; the work progressed slowly, both from San Luis Potos√≠ and from Tampico. There were interruptions, unfulfilled contracts, insufficient funds, and court trouble. In these works they had to overcome the difficulties presented by the laying of the road from Tamasopo to the Highlands, and they built several tunnels penetrating mountains. This bold work challenged the mountains, and the tracks finally found their way to present-day C√°rdenas in La Labor, in April of 1890. From that time on, life in C√°rdenas was totally transformed, and soon the workshops of the C√°rdenas Division were installed. The population grew, the Rasconcito and Colonia Americana neighbourhoods were founded, and the economy was stimulated as a result of the influx of many families who came from Alaquines, Ray√≥n, Lagunillas and other more distant locations. It was a euphoric time that overflowed with joy in all areas of the region. This situation lasted until 1910. By the beginning of the year 1911, C√°rdenas experienced one of the first revolutionary outbreaks led by Higinio Olivo, a native of La Labor and Juan Torres P√©rez, who took up arms in El Corito. The forces of Pedro Montoya and brothers Juan and Victoriano Torres entered in 1911. In 1912 brothers Cedillo, Magdaleno, Saturnino, and Cleofas and began a series of violent acts in open rebellion against President Francisco I. Madero. In 1914 the Cedillistas were in possession of C√°rdenas. They established their headquarters there and committed all kinds of abuses. They seized the station, as well as the trains and cargo. The most important battle in C√°rdenas recorded during the Mexican Revolution took place on May 27, 1917. The square was defended by a garrison commanded by Colonel Fidel Garza and the first captains Ram√≥n Hern√°ndez and Margarito Negrete when he was violently attacked by Cedillista forces. The fighting spread to the entire population, the attackers took the railway installations, burned the chapopote tank and the scale, and tried to burn down the station. Geography=Extension of C√°rdenas According to the Integrated System and Geographic Information Statistics INEGI, 2000, the total area of the municipality is 384.26 km2 and accounts for 0.63% of the state territory. Orography In the municipality are located mountainous formations such as the Sierra de Santa Gertrudis, Sierra Paredes, El Picacho, El Azafr√°n, Catana and El Grande. Climate The average annual rainfall is recorded as 616.6 mm (24.28 in), and most of the region is dominated by semi-arid and semi-warm weather in the west, semi- warm and subhumid weather in the centre, and semi-warm and humid weather with rain in the summer in the east.

Club career Curcija's first taste of senior football came in the lower levels of the Victorian State League, where as a 16-year-old, he made his debut for Diamond Valley United, scoring in three matches before securing a move to Heidelberg United in the National Soccer League. Curcija made his NSL debut in a 1‚Äì0 home loss to Adelaide City in 1994. Another substitute appearance followed before he transferred to rivals South Melbourne the following season. It was at South Melbourne that Curcija established himself as one of Australia's most prolific young strikers. He helped the club to successive championships in 1998 and 1999, and scored a personal best of 19 goals in the 1999‚Äì2000 season. His career highlight for South Melbourne was representing the club in the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship in Brazil. At the age of 23, Curcija secured a dream move to Serbian giants FK Partizan, but he struggled to settle or win a first team spot, and after three months, moved to Portugal where he signed a contract with the ambitious SC Braga in the Portuguese Liga. His first season was restricted to bench appearances as the club finished fourth, but he secured his first starts with the senior squad along with his debut goal the following year. However, throughout his time at the club, he was largely a feature of the club's reserves team who competed in the Portuguese Third Tier. Curcija ultimately returned to South Melbourne for what was the final NSL season in 2003‚Äì04, picking up where he left off in domestic football, scoring 13 goals in 25 appearances. With the league disbanded, Curcija returned to the Victorian Premier League, playing with Essendon Royals in 2004, where he scored at better than a goal a game. His form in 2005 was just as impressive, playing every match of the season for 15 goals. Despite his pedigree, he failed to land a contract in the inaugural A-League season, and signed for newly promoted Kingston City in 2006, where another prolific season followed. In 2007, he transferred to Altona Magic, playing in successive championships in 2008 and 2009, before moving to Oakleigh Cannons for the 2010 season. International career Having established himself as a first team regular for South Melbourne in the National Soccer League, Curcija was selected by Les Scheinflug in the Oceania Qualifying tournament for the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship. He scored a brace in his first match against Fiji, and featured against New Zealand in the group phase and final. The finals were staged in Malaysia, and featured several players who would go on to become senior Socceroos, including Brett Emerton, Lucas Neill, Vince Grella and Mark Bresciano. Curcija featured in all of Australia's matches in the tournament, but failed to trouble the score sheet. Curcija's performances at Under 20 level were rewarded with selection in the Olyroos squad for the 2000 Summer Olympics which were staged in Sydney, Australia. Raul Blanco played him in a striking role alongside Mark Viduka in all of Australia's matches against Italy, Nigeria and Honduras, but he did not score as the Olyroos failed to progress beyond the group phase. He earned his first Socceroos cap under Frank Farina later that year in an away friendly against Kuwait, coming on as a substitute for goalscorer John Aloisi in the 60th minute. He replaced Aloisi again three days later in a match against South Korea, which the Socceroos lost 4‚Äì2 after blowing a 2‚Äì0 lead. Despite playing in a top European league at the time, he failed to impress the national selectors, and these matches remain his only full international caps.

It establishes the legal criteria determining when a person has the ability to make decisions that are fundamental to his/her well-being. The ability to make these types of decisions is termed capacity and the decisions are termed consent. Capacity establishes the legal right to consent to or refuse medical treatment, choose housing arrangements and manage one's money. However, there are different tests for capacity that vary according to the type of decisions that must be made. In some instances, capacity will exist for people who do not have full capacity in the common sense understanding of the concept. Capacity and Incapacity Capacity is presumed under the Act. This means that before a person's right to make decisions for him/herself is removed it must be proven that they do not have capacity. Incapacity is the term for a person who cannot make these decisions. In terms of medical treatment, incapacity is defined as not being able to \\"understand information that is relevant to making a decision concerning his or her own health care, nutrition, shelter, clothing, hygiene or safety, or is not able to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a decision or lack of decision.\\" The key concepts are understanding information about a condition and appreciating the results of treatment options, including refusing treatment. In terms of managing one's property, incapacity is similarly defined as being unable to \\"understand information that is relevant to making a decision in the management of his or her property, or is not able to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a decision or lack of decision.\\" Substitute decision-makers If a person is found to be incapable they will have a substitute decision-maker appointed for them. A substitute decision-maker may be a family member, non-family members are exceptionally rare. The Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee may also be appointed to this role. Whoever is appointed to make decisions for an incapable person is expected to make them in keeping with the same principles of the legislation, understanding the relevant information and appreciating the consequences of decisions. Decisions should also incorporate what can be reasonably known about the person's likely opinions, including preferences and cultural attitudes. A substitute decision-maker can be replaced if they are found to be not meeting their obligations. Right to refuse an assessment Under the Act, incapacity can only be determined by a formal assessment. However, a person has the right to refuse to be assessed. To ensure that this right is upheld, an assessor, prior to beginning an assessment must tell the person being assessed what they are doing, what is its purpose, what impact their finding will have and that the person being assessed has the right to refuse. If a person refuses to an assessment it cannot be conducted. There are limits to a person's right to refuse an assessment. A Court may order an assessment of a person's capacity against their will if it determines that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the person does not have capacity. Assessment The Capacity Assessment Office maintains a limited register of Capacity Assessors, who must be licensed physicians, psychologists, registered nurses, registered social workers or occupational therapists. Assessors must also hold liability insurance for up to $1,000,000, successfully complete a training course with the Capacity Assessment Office and complete ongoing continuing education. The Capacity Assessment Office does not make specific referrals, but they will provide the names of several Assessors based on a client's needs and location. Assessments aim to answer the question of whether a person has capacity in keeping with the legislation. Exactly what methods they will use often depends on the skill set of the specific Assessor and the nature of the problem that they face. In other words, an assessment should always be comprehensive enough to understand a person's ability to make decisions for him/herself, but the decision may require only limited capacity. In this case, it can occur that a person who does not have full cognitive ability can still have capacity to make important decisions. Government Organizations involved with Incapacity=Capacity Assessment Office In Ontario, the Office of the Ministry of the Attorney General oversees the Capacity Assessment Office. The Capacity Assessment Office ensures that only licensed Capacity Assessors are allowed to conduct capacity assessments and can assist members of the public in finding Capacity Assessors. Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee When a person has been found to be incapable the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee can be appointed to manage their property, which includes their money, real estate, investments, bank accounts, and vehicles. The Consent and Capacity Board A person who has been found incapable can appeal their finding before the Consent and Capacity Board. This Board is Composed of public and professional members and will review the history of a person's finding of incapacity and any history since that time. Reviews are permitted on a more frequent when basis when incapacity is first determined and then become more periodic once a set period of time has elapsed. A person is always eligible to have their capacity reviewed. Public versions of the reasons for decisions of the Consent and Capacity Board are published through CanLII and available in a searchable format on the CanLII website, but only the signed original in the Board file serves as the official version of the reasons for decisions. Regulatory bodies Since only regulated professionals are allowed to conduct capacity assessments, a person who believes that they have been treated unfairly by their assessor can lodge a complaint at the assessor's respective self- governing regulatory body. The self-governing bodies are: the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario; the College of Psychologists of Ontario; The Colleges of Nurses of Ontario; The College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers and The Occupational Therapists College of Ontario. In addition, if a person feels that their lawyer has acted in a way that has caused them harm, they can contact the Law Society of Upper Canada. Controversies=\\"Hired Gun\\" Assessors There is a danger that assessors will not be fully objective in certain circumstances. This conduct is most often associated with a professional who believes that his/her referral source will provide future business on the basis of receiving a predetermining finding. This type of misconduct can have serious negative impacts for a client. If a person who is capable is labelled as incapable their rights will be severely violated without just cause. On the other hand, a person who is incapable and is found capable is at risk of causing harm to him/herself or others. \\"Slippery Slope\\" It is a danger for people who are found incapable that they will be put into circumstances that steadily erode their independence. Careful attention must be devoted to ensuring that the extents of incapacity, as well as existing capacities, are appreciated and balanced so that a person can be independent to the greatest extent possible. It is also a concern on the part of many people found incapable, their family and patient advocates that careful attention is given to ensuring that treatments do not cause further incapacity. This concern has particular bearing for psychotropic medication and other treatments that affect the brain. Exploitation A person who loses the right to make decisions on their behalf is exceptionally vulnerable to many types of exploitation. A common form of exploitation is the expropriation of money for purposes that do not benefit the patient and are often clearly fraudulent. This type of exploitation can be perpetrated by a substitute decision-maker, an employee of the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee, a lawyer representing the client or an employee in an institution. Other types of exploitation can include abuse and neglect. Failure to receive \\"necessary care\\" versus \\"personal autonomy\\" There are times when the family or friends of a person, or their community as a whole, may believe that a person needs access to care that they are unwilling or unable to provide to themselves. On the other hand, many of these types of decisions are the most fundamentally personal and private decisions that a person will ever make. There is a conflict of interest in that the community's reasons for wanting a course of action to be imposed on a person are not necessarily the same as that person's, yet he/she is the one who will be required to make the change.

History Butler National was the creation of Paul Butler, an affluent entrepreneur, philanthropist, and sportsman who was the founder of the village of Oak Brook, Illinois. In 1972, renowned golf course architect George Fazio designed Butler on what was previously York Country Club. It was built and seeded in the relatively short span of two years, and the construction was completed under the supervision of Fazio's nephew Tom Fazio, an internationally acclaimed architect in his own right. This club was home to the PGA Tour's Western Open from 1974-1990. The course policy of not allowing female members caused the club to lose the Western Open. In May 2007, Golf Digest rated Butler 21st of \\"America's 100 Greatest Courses.\\" Course Butler National is a relatively flat, tree-lined course, requiring solid golf shots to shoot a good score. The Fazio design is penal and rewards successful positioning and shot shaping. A right to left ball flight is preferable as there are more dog leg lefts than rights. Water hazards will frequently come into play as do the deep faced bunkers. There are approximately 40 sand bunkers. The Butler (back) tees play , with a course rating of 78.1 and slope rating of 152. In the fall of 2004, all of the greens were converted to an A-1 Bent grass and the sand to tour grade signature. The greens are fast, but the difficulty comes in reading the greens as they are very subtle.

Westgarth was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, and, later, the Victorian Legislative Council. Early life William Westgarth was the son of John Westgarth, surveyor-general of customs for Scotland, and his wife Christian, n√©e Thomson He was born at Edinburgh. He was educated at the high schools at Leith and Edinburgh, and at Dr Bruce's school at Newcastle-on-Tyne. He then entered the office of G. Young and Company of Leith, who were engaged in the Australian trade, and realising the possibilities of the new land, decided to emigrate to Australia. Career in Australia Westgarth arrived in Melbourne on 13 December 1840, then a town of three or four thousand people. Its size, and the limits of colonisation, in the 1840s may be gleaned from the fact, that Westgarth witnessed a corroboree involving 700 Aboriginal Australians, in a place a little more than a mile to the north of the present general post office. He went into business as a merchant and general importer, and the firm was later in Market Street under the name of Westgarth, Ross and Spowers. Westgarth was involved in every movement for the advancement of Melbourne and the Port Phillip district. He became a member of the national board of education, in 1850 was elected unopposed to represent Melbourne in the Legislative Council of New South Wales, succeeding Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey, and he took an important part in the separation movement. It was he who originated the idea that the hoofs of the bullocks should settle the boundary question. If they showed that the droves were heading north, that country should remain in New South Wales, if south it should become part of the new colony. When the new colony of Victoria was constituted in 1851, Westgarth headed the poll for City of Melbourne at the election for the Victorian Legislative Council on 13 September 1851. Westgarth held that seat until resigning in April 1853. He had had many activities during the previous 10 years. In 1842 he was one of the founders of the Melbourne Mechanics' Institute, afterwards the Athenaeum; he had done much writing, beginning in 1845 with a half-yearly Report Commercial Statistical and General on the District of Port Phillip. This was followed in 1846 by a pamphlet, A Report on the Condition, Capabilities and Prospects of the Australian Aborigines, and in 1848 by Australia Felix, A Historical and Descriptive Account of the Settlement of Port Phillip. In 1851 he founded the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce and was elected its first president. He visited England in 1853 and brought out another version of his last book under the title Victoria; late Australia Felix. Soon after his return to Australia in 1854 he was appointed a member of the commission of inquiry to go into the circumstances of the Eureka rebellion. Westgarth was elected chairman and showed much tact in his conduct of the inquiry. The commission recommended a general amnesty to the prisoners, who, however, were tried and acquitted. England In 1857 Westgarth went to England, settled in London, and as William Westgarth and Company began business as colonial agents and brokers. He established a great reputation as the adviser of various colonial governments floating loans in London, and was continually consulted during the next 30 years. The finding of gold in Victoria having entirely altered the conditions, Westgarth published a fresh book on the colony, Victoria and the Australian gold mines in 1857 : with notes on the overland route from Australia, via Suez.Libraries Australia - Victoria and the Australian gold mines in 1857 : with notes on the overland route from Australia, via Suez / by William Westgarth In 1861 he published Australia its Rise, Progress and Present Conditions, largely based on articles written by him for the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, and in 1864 he brought out his fourth book on Victoria, The Colony of Victoria; its Social and Political Institutions. In the preface to this he stated that though he had written four times on this subject, each volume had been a fresh work, written without even opening the pages of the previous volumes. He also wrote some pamphlets on economic and social subjects, and edited in 1863, Tracks of McKinlay and Party across Australia. Another piece of editing was a volume of Essays, dealing with the reconstruction of London and the housing of the poor which appeared in 1886. For many years he endeavoured to form a chamber of commerce in London, and at last succeeded in getting sufficient support in 1881. He revisited Australia in 1888 and was everywhere welcomed. When the Melbourne international exhibition was opened he walked in the procession through the avenue of nations alongside Francis Henty, then the sole survivor of the brotherhood who founded Victoria. As a result of his visit two volumes appeared: Personal Recollections of Early Melbourne and Victoria, in 1888, and Half a Century of Australasian Progress, in 1889. Returning to Great Britain Westgarth died suddenly at London on 28 October 1889. He married in 1853 and was survived by a widow and two daughters.

His book Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis to the Walam Olum was published in 2010. His book Ancient America: Fifty Archaeological Sites to See for Yourself was published in 2017. He is the founder and director of the Farmington River Archaeological Project. Early life Feder was very interested in cryptozoology and ancient astronauts as a teenager, when a book called Morning of the Magicians about extraterrestrial aliens turned him on to what he describes as the nonsense in archaeology. \\"Essentially it was Erich von D√§niken before Erich von D√§niken\\", referring to the popular author and popularizer of ancient astronaut theories. \\"I knew it was crap and it got me really pissed off,\\" Feder has stated, adding that researching the claims that were made grew his interest. According to Feder, after becoming a professor, he asked his students what they wanted to learn in the class. They expressed interest in the same things he was interested in as a teen, but he couldn't find a book that dealt with answers to these pseudoscience topics, which led to the writing of his first book, Frauds, Myths, and Mysteries: Science and Pseudoscience in Archaeology. Ken Feder recovering the tip of a stone spearpoint at a 1,000-year-old archaeological site in West Simsbury, Connecticut. Career Feder is the founder and director of the Farmington River Archaeological Project which studies the prehistory of the region in northwest Connecticut. He gained his Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology in 1973 from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, his Master of Arts in anthropology from the University of Connecticut in 1975 and his Ph.D. in anthropology in 1982. In 1993, Feder published an account of his archaeological investigation into a 19th-century historical site in Barkhamsted, Connecticut entitled A Village of Outcasts: Historical Archaeology and Documentary Research at the Lighthouse Site, in which he detailed a case study of a group of Native Americans, emancipated African- American slaves, and European settlers who formed a settlement that lasted from 1740 to 1860. In a review of Feder's book in American Anthropologist, Boston University's Mary Beaudry praised Feder's writing and efforts to draw attention to the settlement and \\"to turn [its] site report into a work of wider relevance,\\" but also criticized the work, suggesting that \\"problems ensue from the perspective prehistorians often bring to historical sites,\\" and suggesting that the field methods used in Feder's study lack the modernity of contemporary archaeological methods. Feder's concentration on the narrative of the story reconstructed by the evidence he examined at the Barkhamsted Lighthouse community site was a key aspect of his interest; of the study, Feder has stated, \\"That's the coolest lesson for me about the lighthouse‚Äîit's also a story about how our country is made up of not only these famous folks we always read about, but about ordinary people who do these extraordinary things living in extraordinary circumstances.\\" Feder's latest book is called Ancient America: Fifty Archaeological Sites to See for Yourself, based on his odyssey across the U.S. visiting all of those fifty sites. \\"These are places where anybody, you don‚Äôt have to be an [a]rchaeologist, can go and respond, 'Wow! That‚Äôs really impressive, that‚Äôs gorgeous, that‚Äôs all mysterious and then talk about this is what it means, this is who built these things, this is how old these places are. So it‚Äôs kind of a travel guide/time travel guide, let‚Äôs call it that.' Feder stands in front of ancient pictographs at Sego Canyon in Utah. Skepticism Feder appeared in the episode on ancient astronauts in the National Geographic Channel's Is It Real? and several episodes of the BBC documentary series Horizon discussing Atlantis and Caral. In 2004, he spoke at the World Skeptics Congress in Italy. He is also a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), an international organization which promotes scientific inquiry. Feder's 1990 book Frauds, Myths, and Mysteries: Science and Pseudoscience in Archaeology attempts to explore various archaeological myths and misunderstandings by comparing phenomena that might otherwise appear unexplainable to similar occurrences and events that are scientifically documented. Gordon Stein, writing for The Skeptical Inquirer, said of Feder's analysis, \\"While some of these (e.g., Piltdown Man) have been covered by many previous authors, few have tried to use the tools of modern scientific archaeology to show why probability is greatly against the authenticity of the particular claim,\\" going on to state that Feder uncovers areas \\"not often examined critically in the popular literature.\\" Feder's work is used as a textbook in a number of undergraduate courses and is currently in its eighth edition. In April 2001 Feder was consulted by a producer who was putting together a documentary about Atlantis for ABC, to follow the release of the network's parent company, Disney's, animated feature Atlantis: The Lost Empire that same year, and who was \\"looking for a reputable university anthropologist who was of the opinion that there is [a] historical and cultural connection between Atlantis and the native civilizations of the ancient New World.\\" Feder issued criticism of the documentary, which he stated was \\"packaging a television program to look like a science documentary that [...] amounted to an infomercial for a cartoon.\\" In the end, Feder did not contribute to the resulting documentary, Voyage to Atlantis: The Lost Empire, which aired June 10, 2001. Discussing the Bosnian pyramid with Steven Novella, Feder stated that it does not make sense that Visoƒçica is anything other than a natural formation. \\"It's all about physical evidence... ancient pyramids don't build themselves.\\" Feder claimed that pseudoarcheologists lack the training to do a professional job evaluating items they may find. Feder's book Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology addresses popular myths, by attempting to provide easily understood explanations for why some inaccuracies are perpetuated. In his book, Feder also attempts to delineate the differences between findings that are questionable from \\"outright frauds.\\" Personal life The Cardiff Giant is Feder's favorite archeological fraud.

The Protector lock (also called the \\"moveable lock\\") was an early 1850s lock design by renowned American locksmith Alfred Charles Hobbs, the first man to be able to pick the six-levered Chubb detector lock at the Crystal Palace Exhibition in the year 1851, which was created with the intent of being a lock that could not be picked. Before Hobbs and his revolutionary lock designs, locks were opened by making a series of false keys, in a process that could take extremely long periods of time; if the series was not properly completed in the lock, and the combination not exactly correct, the lock could not be defeated. This design was accepted as quite unbreakable until Hobbs became the first to be able to pick them, by using very fine and careful manual dexterity; applying a certain level of pressure on the bolt while manipulating each lever, one at time, using a tiny pick inserted through the keyhole.Phillips, B. p.9 In an attempt to create a better locking system, Hobbs proceeded to patent the Protector lock, which, complex in design as it was, involved a transfer in pressure between the lock's internal bolt and tumbler mechanisms to a fixed pin.The Mechanics' Magazine p.269 Hobbs claimed that his design was impossible to defeat and superior to the locks that were then in use, but, in 1854, one of Chubb's locksmiths was able to crack it, aided by the use of special tools.Phillips, B. p.10 The Protector Lock was distinct from Hobbs's other major lock design of the time, which he called the \\"American lock\\", and which slightly preceded the protector lock, in various ways; while the \\"American lock\\" was complicated to use, and expensive to purchase, with the added disadvantage of requiring a very big key, it did not differ greatly from the Protector lock so far as the security it offered, and the Protector lock was described as being much simpler to use. The one advantage that the American lock did have over the protector lock was its actual potential for greater security, if certain internal parts of the lock and key were rearranged in a particular way.

This process can be applied to both physical and digital art mediums such as oil or acrylic paintings, chemical photographic prints, 3-dimensional sculptures, or digital images and video. With its roots in physical artwork, such as painting and sculpture, traditional inpainting is performed by a trained art conservator who has carefully studied the artwork to determine the mediums and techniques used in the piece, potential risks of treatments, and ethical appropriateness of treatment.  History  The modern use of inpainting can be traced back to Pietro Edwards (1744 - 1821), Director of the Restoration of the Public Pictures in Venice, Italy. Using a scientific approach, Edwards focused his restoration efforts on the intentions of the artist. It was during the 1930 International Conference for the Study of Scientific Methods for the Examination and Preservation of Works of Art, that the modern approach to inpainting was established. Helmut Ruhemann (1891-1973), a German restorer and conservator, led the discussions on the use of inpainting in conservation. Helmut Ruhemann was a leading figure in modernizing restoration and conservationNational Gallery,(2019), Helmut Ruhemann Papers: 1939-1979, https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/archive/record/NG29. Retrieved November 2. 2019.. His greatest contribution to the field of conservation \\"was his insistence on following the methods of the original painter exactly, and on understanding the painter's artistic intention\\".Jessell, Bettina, (1977), Helmut Ruhemann's Inpainting Techniques, Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Volume 17, Number 1, Article 1 (pp. 01 to 08), http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic17-01-001.html, Retrieved November 2, 2019. After his career of over 40 years as a conservator, Ruhemann published his treatise The Cleaning of Paintings: Problems & Potentialities in 1968. In describing his method, Ruhemann states that ‚ÄúThe surface [of the fill] should be slightly lower than that of the surrounding paint to allow for the thickness of the inpainting...Inpainting medium should look and behave like the original medium, but must not darken with age.‚ÄùGarland, Patricia, 2011, Chapter3, Tradition of retouching Practices in America, pp 34-52, in Painting Conservation Catalog, Volume III Inpainting,The Paintings Specialty Group of the American Institute for Conservation, https://www.culturalheritage.org/docs/default-source/resource-guides/painting- conservation-catalog-volume-3-(inpainting).pdf?sfvrsn=6, Retrieved November 2, 2019. Cesare Brandi (1906 - 1988) developed the teoria del restauro, the inpainting approach combining aesthetics and psychology. However, this approach was used primarily by Italian restorers and conservators, with the terminology becoming widespread in the 1990s. Technological advancements led to new applications of inpainting. Widespread use of digital techniques range from entirely automatic computerized inpainting to tools used to simulate the process manually. Since the mid-1990s, the process of inpainting has evolved to include digital media. More commonly known as image or video interpolation, a form of estimation, digital inpainting includes the use of computer software that relies on sophisticated algorithms to replace lost or corrupted parts of the image data.  Ethics  In order to preserve the integrity of an original artwork, any inpainting technique or treatment applied to physical or digital work should be reversible or distinguishable from the original content of the artwork. Prior to any treatments, conservators proceed according to the American Institute of Conservation of Historical and Artistic Works. (1994) ‚ÄúAIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice‚Äù[1] https://www.culturalheritage.org/docs/default- source/administration/governance/code-of-ethics-and-guidelines-for- practice.pdf?sfvrsn=21.

Various deliberation decisions over the ethical appropriateness of the amount and type of inpainting done, resides on many factors. As most conservation treatments, inpainting‚Äôs ethical questions rest mainly with authenticity, reversibility and documentation. ‚ÄúAny intervention to compensate for loss should be documented in treatment records and reports and should be detectable by common examination methods. Such compensation should be reversible and should not falsely modify the known aesthetic, conceptual, and physical characteristics of the cultural property, especially by removing or obscuring original material.‚ÄùAmerican Institute of Conservation of Historical and Artistic Works.

Methods  Image restoration using Artificial intelligence Inpainting method techniques depend on the desired goal and type of image being treated. Treatments to fill in the gaps are very different between physical and digital art. With all applications of inpainting, it is important to keep detailed records of the initial state of the images, treatments done and justification for treatment, and the original copies when applicable (e.g. original digital images).  Physical Inpainting  Piero della Francesca - Scene after and before restoration - WGA17592 Inpainting is rooted in the restoration of painted images. In the conservation and restoration of paintings, \\"the term inpainting refers to the compensation of paint losses‚Äîaiming at the recomposition of the missing parts of an image in order to improve its perception by making damages less visible\\".

In other words, inpainting aims to make a visual improvement to the artwork as a whole by repairing missing or damaged parts using methods and materials equivalent to the original artist's work. = Application Techniques = By studying the painting methods of various artists, the composition of paints used historically, and taking the time to carefully study the medium one is working with, conservators are able to, using an array of methodology, restore works very closely to their original visual appearance. Other tips of inpainting: * The picture as a whole determines how to fill in the gap; the purpose of inpainting is to restore the unity of the work so it is crucial to know how the repaired piece will function within the rest of the image. * The structure of the area surrounding the gap ought to be continued into the gap. Contour lines that end at the gap boundary are to be carried on into the gap. * The different regions inside a gap, as defined by the contour lines, are filled with colors matching those of its boundary although the specific materials do not have to be identical. If alternate materials are to be used, it is important to test for potential reactivity. * The small details are painted, i.e. ‚Äútexture‚Äù is added to ensure the eye will not be drawn first to the in-painted region.

Digital Inpainting  There are currently many programs in use that are able to reconstruct missing or damaged areas of digital photographs and videos. Most widely known for use with digital images is Adobe Photoshop. Since the digital files are able to be duplicated, any restorative alterations should be made to the duplicate file, while maintaining the original files in an archive. Given the various abilities of the digital camera and the digitization of old photos, inpainting has become an automatic process that can be performed on digital images. More than mere scratch removal, the inpainting techniques can also be applied to object removal, text removal, and other automatic modifications of images and videos. Furthermore, they can also be observed in applications like image compression and super resolution. In photography and cinema, it is used for film restoration to reverse, repair, or mitigate deterioration (e.g. physical damage such as cracks in photographs or scratches and dust spots in film or chemical damage resulting in image loss; see infrared cleaning). It can also be used for removing red-eye, the stamped date from photographs, and removing objects for creative effect. Digital Image Restoration and Reconstraction This technique can be used to replace any lost blocks in the coding and transmission of images, for example, in a streaming video. It can also be used to remove logos in videos. Deep learning neural network based inpainting can be used for decensoring images. Three main groups of 2D image inpainting algorithms can be found in literature. The first one to be noted is structural (or geometric) inpainting, the second one is texture inpainting, and the last one is a combination of these two techniques. All these inpainting methods have one thing in common: they use the information of the known or non-destroyed image areas in order to fill the gap, similar to how physical images are restored. = Structural = Structural or geometric inpainting is used for smooth images that have strong, defined borders.Bugeau, Aurelie & Marcelo Bertalmio(2011).Combining Texture Synthesis and Diffusion for Image Inpainting.Hal Archives https://hal.archives- ouvertes.fr/hal-00551587/ Retrieved November 1 2019.. There are many different approaches to geometric inpainting, but they all stem from the same idea that geometry can be recovered from similar areas or domains. Bertalmio proposed a method of structural inpainting that mimics how conservators address painting restoration. Bertalmio proposed that by progressively transferring similar information from the borders of an inpainting domain inwards, the gap can be filled.Cao, Frederic et al. (2011) \\"Geometrically Guided Exemplar-Based Inpainting.\\" SIAM Journal of Imaging Sciences Vol 4. no.4 pp 1143-1179. https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/gousseau/inpaintingSIAM.pdf reterieved November 2 2019. = Textural = While structural/geometric inpainting works to repair smooth images, textural inpainting works best with images that are heavily textured.Bugeau, Aurelie & Marcelo Bertalmio(2011).Combining Texture Synthesis and Diffusion for Image Inpainting.Hal Archives https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00551587/ Texture has a repetitive pattern which means that a missing portion cannot be restored by continuing the level lines into the gap; level lines provide a complete, stable representation of an image.Cao, Frederic et al. (2011) \\"Geometrically Guided Exemplar-Based Inpainting.\\" SIAM Journal of Imaging Sciences Vol 4. no.4 pp 1143-1179. https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/gousseau/inpaintingSIAM.pdf retrieved November 2 2019. To repair texture in an image, one can combine frequency and spatial domain information to fill in a selected area with a desired texture. This method, while the most simple and very effective, works well when selecting a texture to be in-painted. For a texture that covers a wider area or a larger frame one would have to go through the image segmenting the areas to be in-painted and selecting the corresponding textures from throughout the image; there are programs that can help find the corresponding areas that work in a similar way as 'find and replace' works in a word processor.Bertalmio, Marcelo & Guillermo Saprio.\\"Image Inpainting\\" https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/3365/1/1655.pdf = Combined structural and textural = Combined structural and textural inpainting approaches simultaneously try to perform texture- and structure- filling in regions of missing image information. Most parts of an image consist of texture and structure and the boundaries between image regions contain a large amount of structural information. This is the result when blending different textures together. That is why state of the art methods attempt to combine structural and textural inpainting. A more traditional method is to use differential equations (such as the Laplace's equation) with Dirichlet boundary conditions for continuity so as to create a seemingly seamless fit. This works well if missing information lies within the homogeneous portion of an object area. Other methods follow isophote directions (in an image, a contour of equal luminance), to do the inpainting. Recent investigations included the exploration of the wavelet transform properties to perform inpainting in the space-frequency domain, obtaining a better performance when compared to the frequency-based inpainting techniques. Model based inpainting follows the Bayesian approach for which missing information is best fitted or estimated from the combination of the models of the underlying images, as well as the image data actually being observed. In deterministic language, this has led to various variational inpainting models. Manual computer methods include using a clone tool to copy existing parts of the image to restore a damaged texture. Texture synthesis may also be used. Exemplar-based image inpainting attempts to automate the clone tool process. It fills \\"holes\\" in the image by searching for similar patches in a nearby source region of the image, and copying the pixels from the most similar patch into the hole. By performing the fill at the patch level as opposed to the pixel level, the algorithm reduces blurring artifacts caused by prior techniques.

Currently Pak Suzuki is the largest car assembler in Pakistan. The first model assembled at Pak Suzuki (Pak Suzuki 800)  History  The firm was founded in September 1982 as a joint venture between the Government of Pakistan and Suzuki Motor Japan, formalizing the arrangement by which Awami Auto Ltd. had produced the Suzuki SS80 from 1982. Suzuki originally owned 25% of the stock, and have gradually increased their holding; they now own 73.09%. Pak-Suzuki was a joint venture between the semi- governmental Pakistan Automobile Corporation (PACO), who had earlier overseen local assembly from kits. Pak Suzuki is the market leader in Pakistan Automobile Market by having more than 60% (as of December 2011) of market share. Lacking serious competition, Pak Suzuki has had a market share of more than 50% since its inception and has complete monopoly in the small car segment. Apart from giving automobile related services like Suzuki Finance and Suzuki Insurance, Pak Suzuki also deals in Pak Suzuki Certified Used Cars. Having assembled both the Carry and Jimny locally since 1976, Suzuki's first locally built product was the 800 cc ST90 Carry van and truck. 25,000 per year was the beginning production. By 1984 the 1000 cc Jimny (SJ410) and 800 cc Alto/Fronte (called \\"FX\\") had been added to the lineup, and a second plant was planned for 1985. Cars built by Suzuki Pakistan often lack essential features which are standard in other cars, such as airbags, rear windshield defogger and rear seat belts. In 2006, Pak Suzuki offered factory-fitted CNG two years after rival Dewan Motors started offering the facility in their locally assembled Hyundai Santros. By 2012, the Pakistani-assembled Suzuki Mehran remained possibly the last car in the world which still used a carburetted engine, but from the end of 2012 Suzuki Mehrans have been equipped with EFI engines to meet the old Euro-II emission standards. As of 2017, the car still remains in production. As a joint venture, Pak Suzuki is also investing in an automobile glass manufacturing company. Current Vehicles As of 2018, Pak Suzuki Motors produces over 150,000 cars and light commercial vehicles.  Suzuki Alto (New Alto) Suzuki Alto (Eight Generation) In 2019, Suzuki relaunched the Eight Generation of Alto (660cc) in 3 different variants replacing Suzuki Mehran.https://www.allnewalto.com.pk * Suzuki Alto VX * Suzuki Alto VXR * Suzuki Alto VXL  Suzuki Bolan  The Suzuki Bolan is only offered in manual transmission. Suzuki Cultus (Celerio) A second generation of the Cultus was launched in Pakistan in 2017 after replacing the first generation Cultus. The new Cultus is a second generation and a rebaged version of Suzuki Celerio which was launched in 2014. *Suzuki Cultus VXR *Suzuki Cultus VXL  Suzuki Mega Carry  Mega Carry was a pickup version of Suzuki APV launched in 2017  Suzuki Ravi  Pickup version of the Suzuki Bolan. Sold only in Manual transmission.  Suzuki Swift  Pak Suzuki launched the second generation of Swift in 2010 when this generation was being globally retired. Pakistan is the only country where the second generation of Suzuki Swift continues to be assembled; elsewhere the Swift is currently in its fourth generation. The Swift is available in two variants: the DLX (with alloy rims, fog lamps, matching side view mirrors, and navigation system), and the Automatic (with all the features and options of the DLX, however with an automatic gearbox). Until it was cancelled in 2017, there was also a base DX model available. All variants feature a 1.3-liter engine. Standard features include a Navigation System with Camera View, ABS, EBD, Immobilizer, Power Steering, Power Windows, Power Mirrors, Central Locking, Fog Lamps etc. In 2020 Pak Suzuki announced that the Swift would be retired in August 2021.  Suzuki Wagon R  Pak Suzuki launched the new Wagon R in April 2014, using the chassis code A1J310. It was offered in three variants ‚Äì VX, VXR and VXL ‚Äì in 6 body colours. The Wagon R gets the 998 cc K10B three-cylinder Euro 2 compliant engine that develops 67 hp at 6,200 rpm and 90 Nm at 3,500 rpm. It is paired to a 5-speed manual transmission. Former Vehicles= Suzuki Alto  Suzuki Alto Produced between 2000-2008. Although the Pakistani assembly of the Alto has stopped as of June 16, 2012, if retailers wish to sell it they could purchase it from Suzuki's other affiliates such as Suzuki in Japan, though it would be more expensive. In 2019, Suzuki relaunched the 660cc Alto in 3 different variants.  Suzuki Baleno  The SY413 Baleno (also known as the Cultus Crescent and Esteem in other countries) was assembled in Pakistan starting 1998 as a replacement of Suzuki Margalla, till 2006 when it was replaced by the Liana. When introduced, it featured a number of improvements over Margalla, such standard power steering, wider tyres (175/70R13 vs 155/80R13), tachometer as standard, 4-spoke steering wheel vs. 2-spoke steering wheel of Margalla, black interior vs grey interior, EFi vs carburettor and 16-valve vs 8-valve. It featured the G13BB engine, though on the chassis plate throughout the entire run it was stamped as G13B. Initial trim levels included GL, GXi, Gli and GliP (also known as Gli Plus). Baleno featured highly advanced technology at its time, as it was the first one to offer distributorless EFi.  Suzuki Cultus  Produced between 2000-2017. Suzuki Cultus was launched in 2000 as a successor to the popular Suzuki Khyber. It is a basic version of globally obsolete Suzuki Cultus Generation 2 as produced in Hungary from 1992 to 2003, with a carburetted 993 cc G10 three-cylinder engine.From 2003 up to 2010 CNG kit was offered as a factory-fitted option. In August 2008, the engine was upgraded to a 4-cylinder 993 cc G10B EFi engine. The EFi was not distributorless and a camshaft-driven electronic distributor was utilized for spark generation. The new engine provided better fuel economy, power delivery and acceleration.  Suzuki FX  Produced between 1982-1988. A modified version of the Suzuki Alto SS40 manufactured under the chassis code SS80, with a 796 cc F8B engine. Early models came with black interior, later changed to beige interior improving the aesthetics by making it appear spacious. Later models remained popular for this reason. A/C was available as an option in some years. Production was discontinued and Suzuki Mehran was launched as a replacement in 1989. Suzuki Khyber Production closed down in 2000, replaced with the Suzuki Alto. Based on First generation Cultus.  Suzuki Kizashi  The Suzuki Kizashi was introduced in Pakistan in 2015 and discontinued in 2016.  Suzuki Liana  The Suzuki Liana sedan, originally with 1.6-litre engines, replaced the Baleno.  Suzuki Margalla  The sedan shape of Suzuki Cultus second generation was initially (1990) imported from Japan to test the market and sold under the name Suzuki Sedan (possibly because it was the first sedan body style offering by Pak Suzuki Motors). It bore a chassis code SF310 and came with a carburetted 3-cylinder 993 cc G10 engine. The market reception was good though the audience complained of low power. The same car was considered for local manufacture as an entry level executive car. Manufacture started 1992 under the name Suzuki Margalla, chassis code SF413 using an 8-valve SOHC 4-cylinder G13 carburetted engine. It came with power steering as an option. Tachometer was not available in any of the variants. The car was offered in variants such GL and GLX, with an upgrade variant called Margalla Plus launched later on. Production was ceased in 1998 to give way to the replacement Suzuki Baleno. In the Pakistani used car market, \\"Suzuki Sedan\\" refers to the 1000 cc import model, whereas Suzuki Margalla means the locally assembled 1300 cc model.  Suzuki Mehran  Suzuki Mehran began production in 1988 as the \\"Alto\\", but was renamed Mehran in 1992. The name stems from an old Iranian name, meaning \\"child of the sun.\\" The Mehran received minor facelifts in 1998 and again in 2004. The Mehran is currently available in VX or VXR equipment levels. It had again received a mild facelift with an asymmetric grille at the same time with the introduction of the EFi engine in 2012. *Suzuki Mehran VXPak Suzuki raises car prices again Dawn (newspaper), Published 31 March 2019, Retrieved 7 May 2019 *Suzuki Mehran VXR  Suzuki Potohar  The Suzuki Samurai as produced by Spain's Santana Motors from 1985 to 2003 with an international 1982-1984 Suzuki F10A 970 cc carburetor engine. Pak Suzuki Motors manufactured it under the name Suzuki Potohar using the chassis code SJ410. The fuel ignition system was legacy distributor with breaker points. A common after-market upgrade was to replace the stock distributor with the one that came with the locally manufactured Suzuki Alto. Only SWB versions were offered. Initial models came with 4-wheel drum brakes though later it was upgraded with front-wheel disc brakes as standard. Factory-fitted CNG was offered in some years as well. Potohar was popular due to high ground clearance, low-end torque, capable 4x4, low fuel consumption and easy maintenance. In 2006, Potohar was discontinued with no locally manufactured replacement. Rather Suzuki Jimny with M13A engine was offered as an import model at nearly twice the cost. Motorcycles As of 2018, Suzuki motorcycles plant produces approximately 44,000 units annually.

History WEPG went on the air in 1954 from studios and transmitting facilities located at Railroad and 3rd Streets in South Pittsburg, Tennessee, not far from the location of the present-day studios and transmitter. Application for the construction permit with the FCC was filed in June 1953 by station engineer, Frank H. McIntosh, calling for a 500 watt facility to serve the valley. Owner and founder, Eaton P. Govan, Jr., launched the station under the business name of Marion County Broadcasting Service, Inc., to fill a void for a local to Marion County, Tennessee radio station. WEPG moved from its Railroad Street location in or around 1969 to its current location on Ash Avenue along the Tennessee River just in the shadow of local landmark, the Shelby Rhinehart Bridge 'aka' the \\"Big Blue Bridge\\" that spans the river connecting South Pittsburg to neighboring New Hope, Tennessee. WEPG utilizes the broadcast tower, which was erected sometime around 1968 or 1969, and which has a height of . The tower and studios border the Tennessee River.

It was originally owned as a joint venture between the locally based Chronicle Publishing Company (which owned a controlling 51% interest) and cable provider Tele-Communications, Inc. (which owned the remaining 49% share). Young Broadcasting acquired majority control of the channel after it acquired parent television station KRON-TV (channel 4) in November 1999, while TCI's interest transferred to AT&T; Broadband upon its acquisition of TCI earlier that year. The channel operated from KRON-TV's (now-former) studio facilities at 1001 Van Ness Avenue in the Western Addition neighborhood of San Francisco. History The channel launched on July 1, 1994, operating as companion service to NBC affiliate KRON-TV (now a MyNetworkTV affiliate) The company was founded by the San Francisco-based Chronicle Publishing Company, in conjunction with Tele- Communications, Inc. (TCI), which carried it on cable channel 35 throughout the provider's San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose service area, and its affiliate company Liberty Media. When BayTV debuted, its programming primarily consisted of rebroadcasts of KRON-TV's news programs, as well as some limited news and talk content exclusive to the channel (including the morning newscast BayTV Morning and a video simulcast of KRON sports director Gary Radnich's midday sports talk show on KNBR (680 AM), The Gary Radnich Show). The channel originally utilized equipment formerly used by its parent station, with a separate staff of writers and producers. On June 16, 1999, the deYoung family announced their intention to liquidate Chronicle Publishing's assets, including KRON-TV (as well as sister stations KAKE-TV in Wichita and WOWT in Omaha, which were both sold to Benedek Broadcasting), BayTV and the San Francisco Chronicle (which it sold to the Hearst Corporation for $295 million in October of that year). Around the same time, TCI's minority share in BayTV was sold to AT&T; Corporation, as part of the company's acquisition of the provider (which became AT&T; Broadband). KRON and Chronicle's majority interest in BayTV were purchased by New York City-based Young Broadcasting for US$737 million cash and $13 million in stock (rising to $823 million by the sale's closure) on November 16, 1999. The transaction was supposed to be completed by April 2000, however finalization of the deal was delayed by two months after former Chronicle editor Clint Reilly filed a lawsuit to block the Hearst Corporation's purchase of the newspaper. On February 10, 2001, KRON station management decided to consolidate BayTV's news departments with that of KRON, resulting in the layoffs of 17 staff members employed with the channel. On July 2, Young Broadcasting announced that BayTV would be shut down after AT&T; Broadband (which has since been sold to Comcast) informed the company that it would stop carrying the channel at the end of that month (AT&T; Broadband spokesperson Andrew Johnson stated to the San Francisco Chronicle that the channel was a \\"financial drain on [AT&T;]\\" as its viewership was insufficient to justify the heavy investments made by the partners, although now-former KRON general manager Paul \\"Dino\\" Dinovitz acknowledged BayTV turned a profit for the first time in 2001); most of BayTV's 44 remaining full-time employees were terminated. Originally slated to close on July 31, the channel ceased operations on August 30, 2001; AT&T; replaced BayTV with the Food Network, which was moved to the provider's expanded basic tier on its Bay Area systems. Programming The programming format of BayTV was modeled similarly to that of news-talk radio stations, featuring a mix of full-length newscasts produced by KRON's news department ‚Äì which comprised much of the channel's daytime and evening schedule ‚Äì and personality-driven talk and local interest programs (which were preceded by news updates produced by BayTV news staff). Throughout its seven-year existence, BayTV underwent several changes to its programming, originally focusing mainly on news and talk programs (including the Pete Wilson-hosted political affairs program Take Issue; the interview program Close-Up with Belva Davis; and book discussion series Bookmark). By the late 1990s, it also incorporated cooking shows (such as Bay Cafe), consumer news and movie review programs (such as All Consuming, hosted by Laurel Pallock of the consumer fraud unit of the San Francisco District Attorney's Office; and Talkin' Pictures, hosted by longtime KRON film critic Jan Wahl). In March 1998, the channel debuted an hour-long newscast at 9:00 p.m., which utilized staff from both the BayTV and KRON news departments with limited duplication of news content from the two operations. Originally co-anchored by Michelle Blaine and longtime KRON anchor Evan White on weeknights and Diana Yee on weekends, the program was reduced to a half-hour ‚Äì matching the existing length of the weekend editions of the broadcast ‚Äì on February 12, 2001, as a result of budget cuts related to the consolidation of the KRON and BayTV news departments (KRON would revive the 9:00 p.m. newscast as part of its schedule, after it became an independent station on January 1, 2002). The channel also rebroadcast KRON-TV's hour-long 6:00 p.m. newscast one hour after its initial broadcast each night at 7:00 p.m. The channel also produced New Media News, a half-hour Silicon Valley-focused technology newsmagazine which aired nationally on Mind Extension University/Knowledge TV from 1995 until it was sold to Discovery Communications in 1999; the daily program was relaunched in February 2000 as Next Step (a title previously used by a separate technology program co-produced by KRON and the Discovery Channel that aired from 1994 to 1997) through a content agreement with Imagine Media-owned magazine Business 2.0. Sports programming In additional to its local programming, BayTV also carried a moderate amount of sports programming. Until the team moved its over-the-air telecasts to San Jose independent station KICU-TV (channel 36) in 1999, the channel carried a limited schedule of Major League Baseball games from the Oakland Athletics that KRON could not air due to its NBC programming commitments, as well as weekly news conferences held by the head coaches of the San Francisco 49ers and Oakland Raiders. In March 1997, BayTV signed a three-year programming agreement with Fox Sports West, under which it carried the daily news program Fox Sports News and select sports events aired nationally by Fox Sports Net (including Major League Baseball games on Thursday nights during the regular season, and college basketball games not carried by Fox Sports Net Bay Area due to scheduling conflicts with events featuring local and state teams). The Fox Sports Net agreement ended on January 22, 1998, with most of the programming moving to newly converted FSN outlet SportsChannel Bay Area, which rebranded as Fox Sports Bay Area on that date (Fox Sports News continued to air on BayTV until March 31, 1998; most of FSN's Pac-10 telecasts also remained on the channel until the package transferred to Fox Sports Bay Area, which aired a limited number of games beforehand, in January 2000). Much of BayTV's sports programming consisted of coverage involving college and high school teams from around Northern California. In 1997, BayTV began airing a featured \\"Game of the Week\\" involving Bay Area schools on Friday nights during the high school football regular season. It also broadcast statewide boys' and girls' high school basketball tournament finals and football championship games sanctioned by the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF). However, it did not air the state basketball finals and Northern California regional basketball championships in 1999 as the CIF declined the channel's proposition to waive the broadcast rights fee; KRON/BayTV management asked for the waiver, citing revenue losses incurred by the fee it paid for the 1998 finals, though the CIF stated that BayTV rescinded the telecast rights due to the conference's delays in getting a waiver from primary rightsholder Fox Sports West 2 (now Prime Ticket) to allow BayTV to produce and televise the games. The channel also aired college basketball games involving the California Golden Bears and Stanford Cardinal that were not covered by Fox Sports Net's contract with the Pacific-10 Conference.

Described by the Guardian as having ‚Äúgripping, exhilaratingly good orchestral playing, surging with energy, laser-sharp focus and collective daring... [and] a technical prowess that is downright terrifying‚Äù, it connects music colleges and the professional music world for generations of European musicians since its foundation in 1976. History Founded by Joy and Lionel Bryer in 1976, the EUYO has been a Cultural Ambassador for the European Union for 40 years. The EUYO's Honorary Patrons include the Heads of Government of all of the EU's Member States, the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Parliament. The Orchestra has worked with many of the world's greatest musicians including Daniel Barenboim, Leonard Bernstein, Sir Colin Davis, Herbert von Karajan, Mstislav Rostropovich and particularly its three Music Directors and current Chief Conductor: Founding Music Director Claudio Abbado, former Music Director Vladimir Ashkenazy, former Music Director and current Conductor Laureate Bernard Haitink and Chief Conductor Vasily Petrenko. The EUYO has performed in most of the world's major concert halls, notably at the Royal Albert Hall, the Musikverein, Carnegie Hall and the Boston Symphony Hall. From Amsterdam to Abu Dhabi, Moscow to Mumbai, Seoul to S√£o Paulo - 4 Continents, 43 countries, 177 cities and 224 venues thus far. The EUYO's 3,000 alumni have all come through the Orchestra's rigorous, annual audition process conducted in all (currently 28) EU Member States, and many are now notable conductors, soloists, teachers, and instrumentalists working with major orchestras in the world, including the London Symphony Orchestra, the Berliner Philharmoniker, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. The EUYO's Summer Home and Principal Venue Partner is Grafenegg, where both organisations launched the European Music Campus in 2014. In 2014, the Orchestra embarked on an innovative partnership programme ‚Äî Towards 2020 ‚Äî which brings together eleven cultural and commercial organisations from ten EU countries, and thirty-five associate organisations from Europe and around the globe including Global partners in Brazil, China, India and the US. The project was co-funded by the EU's ‚ÄòCreative Europe‚Äô cultural funding programme in its first phase and aims at establishing a new model to skill talented young orchestral musicians from all 28 EU Member States in a manner that responds to the changing needs of 21st-century audiences and society. T2020 involves the Orchestra in innovative training prototypes, performance programmes, digital platforms and audience models, all designed to enable cultural development, career opportunities and audience development strategies that are transferable to other cultural and creative sectors. On 12 May 2016, the European Union Youth Orchestra announced that was to cease operations from September 2016 due to a lack of future funding from the European Union.EUYO.eu However, the news attracted extensive support around Europe, where campaigns and flashmobs took place and many conductors and artists including Antonio Pappano, Gustavo Dudamel and Daniel Barenboim put their names to a statement supporting the Orchestra's work.Rhinegold.co.uk On 31 May 2016, an official press announcement from the EU's council of Ministers and Commission confirmed that President Jean-Claude Juncker had ordered three commissioners to find funding for the EUYO. On 1 June 2016, President Juncker announced a proposal to enable the European Union to return the EUYO to core funding.EUYO.eu Relocation to Italy and Brexit The orchestra announced in October 2017 that, as a result of Brexit, it intended to relocate from London to Italy. It was therefore initially expected that British youth would cease to be eligible for the institution. The EUYO moved to Ferrara, Italy during the course of 2018. Its current headquarter is the opera house Teatro Comunale Claudio Abbado located in the centre of the city. The transitional agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom allows for players from the United Kingdom to still be eligible to apply and perform with the EUYO until December 2020. The funding required to enact this provision was dependent on the UK leaving the EU with a deal before the final Brexit deadline. Therefore, in the case of a no-deal Brexit, British citizens would have no longer been able to be part of the EUYO.

Larkins was made a Companion of the Order of Australia on 26 January 2019. Views on higher education While Larkins supported certain measures introduced by John Howard's government, he was largely critical of its over-regulation of the university sector and its failure to index university funding to inflation.Four Corners - 27 June 2005: Interview - Professor Richard Larkins In a speech to the Melbourne Press Club in February 2008, Larkins lamented the 30% drop in public university funding from 1996 to 2004, stressing the central role that universities must play if Australia's economy is to remain competitive in the future.The Education Revolution: the Lucky Country can become the Clever Country As the head of Universities Australia, he has emphasised the need for greater public investment in university teaching and research. Additionally, Larkins has argued that a national internships program should be established to create closer links between universities and industry. More controversially, Larkins has expressed his personal view that the student contribution to HECS payments should be deregulated, noting that all evidence suggests that HECS repayment amounts do not act as a disincentive for students to study and that only this will enable Australia's top universities to continue to compete globally.

History Formed in 2003 by the amalgamation of bands Velvet Llama and Trace, The On Fires (known then as Asleep in the Park) retained the two lead singers Max and Marty. Recording and releasing their debut album Sky Caves In in 2004, the band embarked on a national tour with Epicure , followed by extensive touring in and around Melbourne during 2005/06. 2006 saw the band return to the studio, resulting in the EP Let You Go, released at the end of June 2007. In September 2007 they embarked on their first European tour playing cities such as Amsterdam, Kiev, Berlin, Prague, Krak√≥w, Bucharest and Istanbul and became the first international act to be recorded live-to-air at Istanbul's only commercial rock radio station, K-Rock. The band returned to Europe in September 2008 playing to packed venues across Ukraine (with noted punk musician Sasha Pipa, Attraktor and VV), Romania and Turkey. 2009 saw the release of EPs Adios Motherf-ker and Coming Home (US only) and started with a trip to the Solomon Islands with the Australian Military to perform for troops posted in Honiara. Another European tour ensued, including shows in London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Poland, Romania and Ukraine. During a tour of Poland and Slovakia in early 2010 - the coldest winter in 30 years - a sweaty fan exclaimed \\"You're not asleep, you're on fire!\\" and the band shed their outgrown sleepy name and became The On Fires. The On Fires' second full-length album was released in 2010. Betrayer was recorded in Los Angeles with producer Rick Parker (Dandy Warhols, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Von Bondies). Returning to Poland for Seven Festival in July 2010, the band appeared on Radio Trojka and morning TV program Coffee or Tea - watched by 4 million viewers. The band performed their debut tour of the USA in early 2010, returning later that year and again in 2011, working for the first time with some of America's best musicians including Tobias Ralph, Nicholas D'Amato, Kevin Radomski and Kent Aberle. During a visit to South by Southwest Festival in Austin they happened upon a showcase of Chinese Punk Bands and were mesmerised by Beijing 3-piece PK14. This piqued an interest in the music coming out of China and resulted in the beginning of a love affair with 'the East'. In 2011 and 2012 the band toured China clubs and played to huge festival crowds including: 2011 Midi Music Festival in Beijing, 2011 Zebra Festival in Chengdu, 2012 Strawberry Festival in Beijing and 2012 Lu Dao Festival near Shanghai. After a break of several years from Europe, fellow Australians The Vagrants invited the band to re-acquaint themselves with Germany as openers on an 11-date, 3 week tour before the band returned to China for Midi Festival in Beijing and Zebra Festival in Chengdu.

It is a very popular event and is considered the classical Woodstock of India. This festival, first held in the year 1990, was the brainchild of Protima Bedi, the founder of Nrityagram. The festival is held in the premises of Nrityagram at Hesaraghatta in the outskirts of Bangalore and attracts the best musicians, dancers and cultural artists from across India. Starting from an audience of about 3000 in its inaugural year, the 2003 edition saw over 40,000 people attending the event. Festival The festival is one-night festival which starts in the late evening and goes on till the early morning of the next day. It is held in the amphitheatre located in the premises of Nrityagram at Hesaragahatta, which is a small village located 35 kilometres from the city of Bangalore. There is no entry fee and the seats are available on a first-come basis. Due to this fact, the seats start filling up from the afternoon itself. The publicity for the festival is held in a unique manner by employing folk artists and other troupes who perform on the roads of Bangalore, which publicise the event and also act as a curtain-raiser for the festival. The event is organised with the help of volunteers who belong to the colleges in the city. Many like-minded people also contribute to the event by sponsoring food stalls at the venue, organising food for the artists and also providing cars and other automobiles for ferrying musicians and artists to the venue. The amphitheatre can accommodate about 3,000 people and large screens are provided outside the venue for people who could not get a seat in time. Chronology=2002 Held on 2 Feb 2002, the artists who performed included Aruna Sairam (Carnatic vocal), the Warsi brothers, Ateeq Hussain Khan (Qawwali) and Suma Sudhindra (who introduced the Tarangini veena). This event was beamed live on Doordarshan and also received good coverage on other TV channels 2003 Performances in this edition of Vasanta Habba included a concert on the Mohan Veena by Grammy Award winner, Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, Hindustani classical by Shubha Mudgal, fusion music by Taufiq Querishi and qawwali by the Ateeq Hussain Khan Warsi brothers. This event was attended by over 40,000 people. 2004 Held on 7 Feb 2004, the artists who performed included the renowned saxophonist Kadri Gopalnath and the Carnatic music exponent, Bombay Jayashri. Current Scenario The event was not held in the year 2005 because India was facing the after-effects of the Indian Ocean tsunami. Habba was never held again and Nrityagram blamed it on a financial crisis. Since Nrityagram has not commented on the fate of Habba, it is assumed that the festival has been scrapped for good. Meanwhile, their dance ensemble has consistently received rave reviews and now go on frequent annual performance tours to the USA and other countries.

Nearly 3,500 people representing all segments of the population were randomly recruited to participate in this day-long discussion of health care reform proposals that are before the California legislature. Background Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California proposed comprehensive health insurance reform for California on January 9, 2007 that would lead to nearly universal health insurance coverage in the state. The plan involved a complex set of requirements that employers provide health insurance or pay into a state insurance pool, that health care providers and insurers pay a new fee, and that all individuals be legally required to carry health insurance. The state would use the new fees to expand free or low-cost health insurance to those with low incomes, would allow higher income individuals to purchase ‚Äúcatastrophic‚Äù insurance, and would require insurance companies to sell insurance to any applicant (called guaranteed issue) , Los Angeles Times, Gov. offers bold prescription, Jan 9 2007, p. A1 By mid-year, two different Democratic proposals that overlapped the Governor‚Äôs proposal had merged into Assembly Bill 8 (AB8) and were seen as the most likely health insurance expansion bill to be passed and signed by California‚Äôs governor in 2007., Los Angeles Times, Democrats merge health plans, June 22, 2007, p. b1 Another bill with substantial support in the legislature proposed a single payer system, SB840. It was similar to a bill that had passed the legislature in a previous session and been vetoed by the Governor., Los Angeles Times, Kuehl's health plan to get new push, February 27, 2007 p. b1 Much of the organizational ideas and effort were provided by AmericaSpeaks, a group which promotes deliberation as a community method in a variety of communities, regions and topics. The forum California Speaks was designed as a non- partisan discussion about the major health insurance reforms in the state. Using neutral, accessible materials, a cross section of Californians learned about the different options and voted during the forum about what the state should do. The options focused on issues concerning AB8 and, to a lesser degree, SB840. The product of the discussions will be presented to the Governor and legislative leadership to inform state legislation that is currently being negotiated in Sacramento. The actual format of the discussions was that participants were divided into groups of 10‚Äì12 people, with a facilitator to make sure everyone got a chance to be heard. A discussion guide was provided which explained the background of the issues. Each table reported its ideas using wireless computers and participants voted on the proposals, using a polling keypad. The entire group responded to the strongest themes generated from table discussions and voted on final recommendations to decision makers. Also, various local sessions across the state were in contact via interactive television simultaneously. Results from the discussion were compiled into a report at the end of the meeting, and were given to participants, decision-makers and the media as the meeting concluded. As a participant in the San Diego group, I don't understand the exclusion of every group throughout the state preferring a single party payee system to any of the choices offered for discussion. Those running the forum said that this choice had already been rejected by the state and we would not even be allowed to discuss or consider this as an option. The forum almost ended at that point as this is what the citizenry wanted. The groups from Oakland and Humboldt counties were prepared to walk out if some version of a single party system wasn't included in the discussion. Our table was politically diverse in its make up, yet upon a straw vote ten of our twelve preferred some form of Medicare coverage for all. Upon threat of there not being any discussion at all, we were allowed to consider how such a program would differ from the choices on the table, but nothing beyond that would be accepted. I was a little stunned to hear groups of polar political differences in other issues be unified in their support of a health care system similar to the rest of the world's. Without my notes I can't report accurately on the remainder of the meeting, only that the participants had been muzzled and nobody had a chance to even discuss their opinions. The results Participants identified four key values to guide health care reform at the start of the forum: Health care should be affordable by all, everyone should have access, greed (profit) should not be part of the system, and wellness/prevention should be a priority. There was general support for the AB8/Governor‚Äôs range of proposals, with a number of conditions. Employer mandates were supported but most participants also wanted to assure that part-time and other employees were covered. Individual mandates were supported as long as there was an adequate standard for quality of care and other guarantees. California Speaks, Preliminary Report, August 11, 2007 Over 80% of this cross-section of Californians expressed a willingness to ‚Äúshare the responsibility‚Äù for paying for expanded health insurance. The impact The results and interpretation were presented to representatives of the California Legislature and Governor on August 23, 2007. The intent of the process is that the opinions of this large (3,500 person) group of average Californians from around the state, who spent a full day discussing the issues, would inform the California health care reform debate.

Simply stated, it provides that the \\"internal affairs\\" of a corporation (e.g. conflicts between shareholders and management figures such as the board of directors and corporate officers) will be governed by the corporate statutes and case law of the state in which the corporation is incorporated, sometimes referred to as the lex incorporationis.Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 U.S. 624, 645 (1982).McDermott Inc. v. Lewis, 531 A.2d 206 (Del. 1987). Practical effects of the doctrine The internal affairs doctrine ensures that such issues as voting rights of shareholders, distributions of dividends and corporate property, and the fiduciary obligations of management are all determined in accordance with the law of the state in which the company is incorporated. On the other hand, the \\"external affairs\\" of a corporation, such as labor and employment issues and tax liability, are typically governed by the law of the state in which the corporation is doing business. Some issues and activities, such as contracts, mergers and acquisitions, and sales of securities to third parties, may be governed both by the laws of the state of incorporation and by the laws of the state in which the transaction takes place, and in some cases, by federal law as well (for example, United States securities law and antitrust law). Relation to federalism In the United States, each state has the power to set its own corporate law. Because of this, and the fact that the internal affairs doctrine has been used by courts to allow application of the lex incorporationis, this has created a competitive market for incorporations among the states. Several states have taken advantage of this situation by becoming corporate havens, particularly Delaware and Nevada. Likewise, many jurisdictions apply the internal affairs doctrine internationally, which has permitted offshore financial centres to flourish.

The species is unique in the morphology of the pelvic spine and fin, making identification of the species easier than most of its relatives. The species is of minor commercial importance, taken by seine net and marketed fresh throughout its range. The club-foot whiting was first described and named by Pieter Bleeker in 1849, however the exact origin of the holotype specimen is unknown. Bleeker conducted most of his studies on the fishes of South East Asia, and one author has attributed the type specimen to samples collected from the Java Sea. The common name of the species, club-foot whiting, is derived from its unique pelvic fin structure which may look, and possibly act as club shaped 'foot'. The other common name; Horrelvoet sillago, is a name used in Africa and is derived from Afrikaans. Description As with most of the family Sillaginidae, the club-foot whiting has a slightly compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth, with the species reaching a maximum overall length of 35 cm. The body is covered in small ctenoid scales extending to the cheek and head, which has scales arranged in 3-4 rows. The first dorsal fin has 11 to 12 spines and the second dorsal fin has 1 leading spine with 20 to 22 soft rays posterior. The anal fin has 2 spines with 22 to 23 soft rays posterior to the spines. Possibly the most obvious identifying feature of the species is the characteristic pelvic fin, of which the first ray is modified into a laterally compressed club-like structure that overlaps the much reduced ventral spine at the base of the fin. Other distinguishing features include 66 to 73 lateral line scales and a total of 35 vertebrae. The swim bladder morphology is also very distinct in the Club-foot whiting, with a structure very different from the rest of the Sillaginidae. It is a very flat, non functional structure that sits just behind the axis vertebra and abruptly narrows to a fine point terminating at the 9th abdominal vertebrae. The organ has no duct like process stemming from the ventral surface unlike other species of the family Sillaginidae. The club-foot whiting is pale sandy brown colour above, with a paler underside and dusky scale margins. A dull silver grey mid-lateral band is usually present, normally with an accompanying wide dusky band below on the lower sides. The fins are hyaline in colour, with only the spinous first dorsal fin having a light dusting of fine black spots at the tip.> Distribution and habitat S. chondropus ranges from South Africa, northward along the west African coast to Pakistan, India, Myanmar, Indonesia, northern New Guinea, Thailand, Philippines and Taiwan. It has never recorded from southern New Guinea or Australia. The species inhabits shallow coastal waters, from depths of 0 to 5 m. In eastern Taiwan, blackish substrates with a strong current and wave action are inhabited, while in India it has been known to enter estuaries. The reduced swim bladder and modified pelvic fin indicates that this species is demersal and may use the pelvic fin pads somewhat like sled runners on the substrate. Relationship to humans The club-foot whiting is commonly taken by seine net throughout its range and is generally sold fresh in local markets alongside other species of sillaginid. Small subsidence fisheries in India are known to take substantial amounts of the species as well.

For this reason, the grammatical systems studied in Regulated Rewriting theory are also called \\"Grammars with Controlled Derivations\\". Among such grammars can be noticed:  Matrix Grammars =Basic concepts Definition A Matrix Grammar, MG, is a four-tuple G = (N, T, M, S) where 1.- N is an alphabet of non-terminal symbols 2.- T is an alphabet of terminal symbols disjoint with N 3.- M = {m_1, m_2,..., m_n} is a finite set of matrices, which are non-empty sequences m_{i} = [p_{i_1},...,p_{i_{k(i)}}], with k(i)\\\\geq 1, and 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n, where each p_{i_{j}} 1\\\\leq j\\\\leq k(i), is an ordered pair p_{i_{j}} = (L, R) being L \\\\in (N \\\\cup T)^*N(N\\\\cup T)^*, R \\\\in (N\\\\cup T)^* these pairs are called \\"productions\\", and are denoted L\\\\rightarrow R. In these conditions the matrices can be written down as m_i = [L_{i_{1}}\\\\rightarrow R_{i_{1}},...,L_{i_{k(i)}}\\\\rightarrow R_{i_{k(i)}}] 4.- S is the start symbol Definition Let MG = (N, T, M, S) be a matrix grammar and let P the collection of all productions on matrices of MG. We said that MG is of type i according to Chomsky's hierarchy with i=0,1,2,3, or \\"increasing length\\" or \\"linear\\" or \\"without \\\\lambda-productions\\" if and only if the grammar G=(N, T, P, S) has the corresponding property. The classic example  :Note: taken from Abraham 1965, with change of nonterminals names The context-sensitive language L(G) = { a^nb^nc^n : n\\\\geq 1} is generated by the CFMG G =(N, T, M, S) where N = {S, A, B, C} is the non-terminal set, T = {a, b, c} is the terminal set, and the set of matrices is defined as M : \\\\left[S\\\\rightarrow abc\\\\right], \\\\left[S\\\\rightarrow aAbBcC\\\\right], \\\\left[A\\\\rightarrow aA,B\\\\rightarrow bB,C\\\\rightarrow cC\\\\right], \\\\left[A\\\\rightarrow a,B\\\\rightarrow b,C\\\\rightarrow c\\\\right]. Time Variant Grammars Basic concepts Definition A Time Variant Grammar is a pair (G, v) where G = (N, T, P, S) is a grammar and v: \\\\mathbb{N}\\\\rightarrow 2^{P} is a function from the set of natural numbers to the class of subsets of the set of productions.  Programmed Grammars  Basic concepts Definition A Programmed Grammar is a pair (G, s) where G = (N, T, P, S) is a grammar and s, f: P\\\\rightarrow 2^{P} are the success and fail functions from the set of productions to the class of subsets of the set of productions. Grammars with regular control language=Basic concepts Definition A Grammar With Regular Control Language, GWRCL, is a pair (G, e) where G = (N, T, P, S) is a grammar and e is a regular expression over the alphabet of the set of productions. A naive example Consider the CFG G = (N, T, P, S) where N = {S, A, B, C} is the non-terminal set, T = {a, b, c} is the terminal set, and the productions set is defined as P = {p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5, p_6} being p_0 = S\\\\rightarrow ABC p_1 = A\\\\rightarrow aA, p_2 = B\\\\rightarrow bB, p_3 = C\\\\rightarrow cC p_4 = A\\\\rightarrow a, p_5 = B\\\\rightarrow b, and p_6 = C\\\\rightarrow c. Clearly, L(G) = { a^*b^*c^*}. Now, considering the productions set P as an alphabet (since it is a finite set), define the regular expression over P: e=p_0(p_1p_2p_3)^*(p_4p_5p_6). Combining the CFG grammar G and the regular expression e, we obtain the CFGWRCL (G,e) =(G,p_0(p_1p_2p_3)^*(p_4p_5p_6)) which generates the language L(G) = { a^nb^nc^n : n\\\\geq 1}. Besides there are other grammars with regulated rewriting, the four cited above are good examples of how to extend context-free grammars with some kind of control mechanism to obtain a Turing machine powerful grammatical device.

On March 20, the Japanese 143rd Regiment plus cavalry units of the 55th Division attacked the positions of the Chinese 5th Army Cavalry Regiment north of the Kan River, driving the Chinese forces back with heavy losses. The bulk of the cavalry regiment was withdrawn to the north of Toungoo, leaving only a company of cavalry and infantry each to delay the advancing Japanese. Meanwhile, the commanding general of 200th Division, Dai Anlan‚Äôs fortifications at Oktwin and around Toungoo were now ready. They were built using timber, which was in abundant supply, and all positions were carefully concealed. On March 21, Japanese forces brushed aside the delaying forces and reached the 200th Division outposts at Oktwin. The 122nd Regiment of the 55th Division attacked 200th Division positions at first light on March 22, but made little headway. Japanese forces attacking the Chinese positions consisted of a battalion of infantry with several guns; the defenders were the 1st Battalion, 600th Regiment. The Japanese sent cavalry forces around the left flank of the Chinese and the position was stabilized only when reserve forces of the 1st Battalion, 598th Regiment were committed immediately in counterattacks. The Japanese were now more careful after the ambush, and used their artillery and machine guns to fire at suspected positions before sending their infantry forward. Light machine guns were positioned up among the trees and caused many Chinese casualties. Eventually the Chinese set up their heavy machine guns to fire at an angle to deal with this menace. On March 23, the Japanese attacked again on the left flank with strong artillery and air support. The battle continued until 4 pm without much success for the attackers, who then tried another flanking move with a company of infantry and scores of cavalry troops around the right side of the Chinese positions. The Chinese held their ground until nightfall and fell back to the main defensive line at Toungoo on March 24.

It is situated between two subdivisions, Agro Homes and Soldiers' Hills, thus giving it two addresses: 101 Canary St, Agro Homes Subdivision, Putatan, Muntinlupa City and MBAI Commercial Complex, Soldiers Hills, Muntinlupa City. It was founded in 1983 as the Agro Homes Early Education Center (AHEEC) and since then has evolved into one of the leading schools in Muntinlupa. The students have been placed among the Ten Most Outstanding Students of Muntinlupa City for the past 20 years, almost annually. Beginnings The late Major-General Santiago R. Madrid Jr., together with his family, settled at Soldiers' Hills Subdivision after his stint as commander in Cebu Island. When his fourth child, Judy, was already of schooling age, they began searching for a school they could entrust her in. To their dismay, not one was present in the vicinity of Soldiers' Hills and even in the adjacent Agro Homes. The Major General Santiago R. Madrid Jr. Building, which is the main building of the campus Wanting to give their child the best education she could have, they considered starting a preschool. Mrs. Remedios Madrid, the general's wife, was particularly confident for she was a teacher herself. Thus, armed with municipal government's permission (Muntinlupa was still a municipality then) and sheer determination, they founded the Agro Homes Early Education Center in 1982. Mrs. Madrid invited some of her teacher friends to operate the fledgling learning center, teaching basic skills such as writing, speaking, mathematics and values. In the short span of two years, the school earned the respect and trust of parents within the area for its excellence in instructing children. Expansion In 1992, after requests from parents and pupils to expand the service of AHEEC to the community, the school administration established Elementary and Secondary Levels, registering itself under the name South Crest School. To meet the needs of the growing student population then, they expanded the school complex to the former cogonal area of Soldiers' Hills (whose remnants are still preserved today as a study area for students and as a site of observation for biology activities).

Motto and designation  The motto of the division, Nomine et Virtute Prima, translates literally to \\"La premi√®re par le nom et la valeur\\" in French, \\"The first by name and valor\\". The choice of the insignia, the cross of Saint Louis by g√©n√©ral Jean Touzet du Vigier, comes from the place of formation of the unit, Tunisia, where King Louis IX of France came to rest in 1270. The division is known and referred to as \\"division Saint-Louis\\". The division was cited three times at the orders of the armed forces during the Second World War.  History = 1943‚Äì1946  In 1943, a French armed force was formed in North Africa. The unit was equipped with modern equipment coming from the United States, and the program anticipated the constitution of several armed divisions. Following various materials arrivals, only three divisions were constituted, on the following: * One command staff * One company of headquarter staff * Three command staff brigade * One reconnaissance regiment * Three tank regiments * One chasseur tank regiment * Three mounted infantry battalions * Three artillery groups * One engineer battalion * One group FTA * One repair group squadron * One transmission company * One service company * One medical battalion * One exploitation group This division was organised on American lines, in three Combat commands. The three French divisions were organised like this for their 1944-1945 operations. Within this context, the 1st Armored Division (1st DB) was formed on May 1, 1943. The division was heir to the Light Mechanised Brigade () which combat engaged in Tunisia. On January 28, 1943, General Jean Touzet du Vigier (promoted on December 25, 1942) took command of this unit in formation. He had left the command of the BLM to g√©n√©ral Brossin de Saint-Didier and installed his command post in Mascara where the training center for armored brigades garrisoned. When first established, 1 DB consisted of a reconnaissance regiment, the 3rd Chasseurs d'Afrique, of Constantine; two tank regiments, the 2nd and 5th Chasseurs d'Afrique, Oran and Maison Carr√©e; and a fourth Chasseurs d'Afrique regiment, the 9th, equipped with tank-destroyers. Adding to these four formations, one mounted regiment, the 2nd Zouaves, of Oran, the 68th Artillery Regiment, of Tunisia; the 88th Engineer Battalion, recently created at Port-Lyautey, and the 38th FTA group, of T√©n√®s. In the coming months of May 1943 joined transmission and services. In August, the train and a squadron group reinforced immediately. Then, the 2nd Chasseurs d'Afrique was divided (doubled) to form 2nd Tank-Cuirassiers Regiment, a regiment that g√©n√©ral du Vigier commanded in 1940. The latter had just been promoted to a divisional general on August 25, and all the forces which were under his disposition were grouped around Mascara. The 2nd Zouaves Regiment disappeared and was replaced, as the infantry of the division, by three independent battalions, belonging to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Zouaves, forming a demi-brigade. The division became part of the First Army (then designated Army B) and which would participate to the amphibious assault on Provence. The first embarking commenced in Oran and Mers-el-K√©bir at the end of the month of July 1944, after several peregrinations. The Naval ships lifted anchors on August 10 and 11. The disembarking should have taken lieu between Saint-Tropez and Saint-Rapha√´l. At the dawn of August 15, an enormous naval fleet was assembled north-west of Corsica steering and heading north. The operations of the 1st Armored Division throughout the course of World War II comprised three phases: * From the Mediterranean to the Vosges, August 15 to November 13, 1944 * Combat in Alsace, November 14, 1944 to February 9, 1945 * February 10 to May 7, 1945 = From the Mediterranean to Vosges, August 15 to November 13, 1944 = Throughout the course of the first phase operations, the CC1 was engaged in battle, then the entire division competed with the VI Corps, the siege of Toulon, Marseille and the liberation of Provence. The unit reached the Rh√¥ne by means of improvisation, regrouped, west of the river for fifteen days following the disembarking and engaged in a ride of 600 kilometers, which would bring them to the footsteps of the Vosges, following an uninterrupted combat engagement event series, which lead to the liberation of Saint-√âtienne, Lyon, Anse et Villefranche, Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne, Chagny, Beaune, Dijon and Langres. Started then the hardships of a slow and difficult incursion by the valleys of the Vosgues, in the mud and the rain and snow. After 54 days of marching towards Le Thillot, which stations are M√©lisey, Servance, Haut-du- Them-Ch√¢teau-Lambert, Ramonchamp, Cornimont, Travexin, Fresse, la Chevestraye, Recolonges, la Chapelle de Ronchamp, colline de Bourl√©mont, the division succeeds to the Trou√©e de Belfort on October 18, 1944. Following this first phase operations, the 1st DB was cited for a first time at the orders of the armed forces. = Combat for Alsace November 14, 1944 to February 9, 1945 = During the course of the second phase, the re DB was the first to penetrate Alsace and the first at Rhin. Making way on November 14 from the high valley of Doubs, the 1e DB mounted the offensive on Belfort. The division operating within the cadre of the 1st Army Corps (g√©n√©ral B√©thouart) slides along H√©ricourt along the French and Swiss border and apprehended Delle on November 18. The next day, the CC3 was in Alsace and, at 1800, the tank platoon of lieutenant Loisy was able to raise the fanion in the Rhin, at Rosenau. The latter was part of the 4th squadron of the 2nd African Chasseur Regiment. This officer would meet his end on the next November 23, when his tank was hit by an anti-tank launcher during the attack on caserne Lefebvre at Muhouse. On the 20, colonel Caldairou entered the city. Nevertheless, despite the success resulting from the junction of the 1st and 2nd Army Corps in the region of Burnhaupt, Colmar remained well protected. During two months, the division held in the snow a defensive sector on Dollar, south of that of what would be later referred to as the Colmar Pocket. On January 20, the 1st Army relaunched the assault on the two northern and southern flanks of the pocket, in the middle of a snow storm. Following a three-week struggle, Alsace was liberated and Colmar seized on February 2. The division, which engaged in combat since December 5 under the orders of g√©n√©ral Sudre, following an annoying progression in between mines, witnessed a short exploitation which led to Chalamp√© on February 9 in the morning. Accordingly, the division finished the campaign of France started on August 15, 1944 and which was over six months later on the Rhin. Following this second phase of operations, the 1e DB was cited a second time at the orders of the armed forces. = February 10 ‚Äì May 7, 1945 = At the beginning of the third phase, since April 5, the CC2 was in Germany. Combat engaged with the 9th Colonial Infantry Division, the path throughout the For√™t-Noire was cleared, to deliver to the 1st Army the important routes. Later to the turn, the CC3 combat engaged supporting the colonials. Following a march on Kehl and Offenburg, they made way south to apprehend Fribourg on April 21. They rejoined the division on the 28 south- west of Ulm. The 1st Armored Division crossed the Rhin on April 17. G√©n√©ral Sudre regrouped means at the exception of CC3 around Freudenstadt, and while acting with the cadre of the 1st Army Corps, his unit mounted the assault. The division accordingly made way to Danube by Rottweil and Horb, crossed the river on April 21 at Matulheim and Tuttlingen, and while engaging Stockach, pushed back all along the Danube by Sigmaringen until Ulm which was apprehended in liaison with the American 7th U.S. Army arriving from the North. The 1re DB apprehended Immenstadt on April 30 and reached the same day the Austrian frontier to occupy Aach and Oberstdorf. With only the field of mountains in plain sight, the division opened the way for the infantry and regrouped around de Biberach. First in the Rhin, first in Danube, the division with the Cross of Saint-Louis reached objectives following a sequence of successful event combat engagement series. The division played a decisive role towards the final campaign. The CC2 in For√™t-Noire, the CC3 in the fields of Bade, then the entire division engaged in combat until May 7. Following this ultimate and third phase operations, the 1e DB was cited for a third time at the orders of the armed forces. = End of the war = Following the cessation of hostilities, the 1ere DB joined Palatinat, around Landau. The division remained there for two months. The division sent to Berlin the first detachment in charge of representing France, on July 1, composed of : a squadron of the 3rd African Chasseur Regiment, a squadron of the 9th, 2 companies of the 1st and 3rd Zouaves, and a train detachment. On September 5, the headquarter staff of the division garrisoned at Tr√®ves. The 1re DB, with reduced effectif by the demobilization, returned to France and garrisoned, October 1945 to March 1946 in the zones of Bourges, Ch√¢tellerault, Nantes and Angoul√™me. The division was dissolved on March 31, 1946. = Composition in 1944 = The 1re DB which disembarked in Provence in August 1944 was composed of 73% Europeans and 27% Indig√®nes. Organic units: * 3rd African Chasseur Regiment () : r√©giment de reconnaissance * 9th African Chasseur Regiment () : r√©giment de chasseurs de chars √©quip√© de Tank Destroyer (TD) * 38e groupe de FTA : artillerie antia√©rienne * 88e bataillon du g√©nie * R√©giment du train divisionnaire * 291e compagnie de transport * 91/84e compagnie de transmissions * 11e GERD * 15e bataillon m√©dical * CC1 ** 2nd Cuirassiers Regiment () : r√©giment de chars ** 2nd Zouaves Regiment () : infanterie port√©e ** 68th Artillery Regiment, I/68th () : artillerie * CC2 ** 5th African Chasseur Regiment (): r√©giment de chars ** 1st Zouaves Regiment () : infanterie port√©e ** III/68th : artillerie * CC3. ** 2nd African Chasseur Regiment () : r√©giment de chars ** 3rd Zouaves Regiment () : infanterie port√©e ** II/68th : artillerie = Organization of the mounted Zouaves battalions = The infantry of the 1re DB was constituted of three mounted Zouaves battalions () organized within the following: One BZP was assigned to each of the three CC which composed the 1e Armored Division. The effectif was almost 800 men (Pied-Noirs, Metropolitan French and Maghrebis) and consisted of 3 combat companies with almost 180 to 200 men each. Each company consisted of three combat sections (platoons) of almost fifty men mounted by 5 half-tracks (armed with machine guns, mortars and cannon 57 anti-tank). Different and various circumstances governed combats of St-Loup-de-la-Salle, on September 6, 1944, almost 30 kilometers east of Tailly. The entire BZP endured the heavy attack. In other circumstances, road combats were also expected, which led the Zouave to often progress through mounting tanks. Nevertheless, Zouaves also often mounted assaults by themselves. Such various governing circumstances were taking place on September 9 in front of Nuits-St-Georges. A company of the 3rd BZP was ordered to apprehend Nuits-Saint-Georges. Tanks were occupied in Beaune and could not provide fire support. The resistance was strong and companies without rear support endured heavy losses. As tanks were made available again, assaults were relaunched. These were, briefly evoked, the types of various circumstances in which the BZPs conducted battle. Losses were heavy. The infantry accompanying the 1e DB endured killed in action and wounded, 1700 men out of 2400, the initial effectif. Almost 72% of the effective. Losses were compensated by reinforcements sent from North Africa as well as numerous volunteers who engaged as villages and cities were being liberated.Texte √©manant du colonel ANDERHUBER, ancien du 3e BZP, Amicale des Anciens du 2e Zouaves 20 juin 2011 - Bulletin n¬∞45  1948 to 1999  The 1st Armoured Division was recreated in 1948.

The public radio station is a member station of National Public Radio (NPR) and airs a wide variety of programming, including All Things Considered, Democracy Now!, and jazz and classical music. KCBX has a network of repeaters and translators that enable the station to be heard throughout the Central Coast of California. KCBX itself broadcasts in HD Radio. History KCBX first signed on July 27, 1975 and began airing a variety of National Public Radio (NPR) programming, plus jazz, classical music, and foreign language shows. KSBX, a full-power repeater of KCBX in Santa Barbara, began broadcasting April 1, 2003. From the 1970s through the end of 2012, KCBX broadcast live meetings of the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors. The station cited a lack of interest in the radio broadcast, as county residents can stream meetings online, in its decision to drop coverage of the meetings. Repeaters and translators KCBX operates two full-power repeater stations: KSBX on 89.5 MHz in Santa Barbara, California, and KNBX on 91.7 MHz in Monterey County. The station also operates several low-power FM translators scattered throughout the Central Coast. KPBS-FM interference problem in Santa Barbara In parts of the Santa Barbara area, sometimes during atmospheric ducting, co-channel KPBS-FM in San Diego can override or interfere with the KSBX signal. At one time, KSBX was a 9-watt translator on 89.9 MHz; later, another station began using that translator. Eventually, a deal was reached that would vacate that frequency. In 2006, KCBX applied for a U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) construction permit to move back to 89.9 MHz and increase the effective radiated power from 50 watts to 350 watts. As part of the application, the station enclosed copies of numerous letters and emails from listeners complaining about the signal override or interference from KPBS. In support of the frequency change, a consulting broadcast engineer was hired to analyze the situation, make signal strength measurements during ducting, and fully explain the technical causes of the problem to the FCC. Making the interference problem worse is the fact that the KPBS signal travels completely over water. In 2010, KPBS was granted a construction permit to increase its effective radiated power from 2,700 watts to 26,000 watts. The consulting engineer explained to the FCC that if KSBX's frequency change was not granted, this would worsen the interference problem. In February 2012, the FCC dismissed the construction permit application from KCBX. KPBS started broadcasting with the new 26,000 watt signal on October 1, 2012.

The Chigil-Shatuo were Manichaeans, and \\"hundred\\" is not always a military team, but also a religious category y√ºz er \\"hundred monk men\\" as is stated, for example, on a number of the Manichaean Yenisei monuments of ancient Turkic writings. Thus y√ºz er, as opposed to otuz oglan or otuz er, is a category of dominating level.Zuev, \\"Early Turks: Essays of history and ideology\\", Almaty, Daik-Press, 2002, p. 146, The Chigils were prominent in the Kara-Khanid Khanate, where they formed the main body of the troops.Barthold, Turkestan, 317.

The eastern Kagan was the senior Kagan, with his court in Kashgar and Balasagun (Buran fortress, near Tokmak in Kyrgyzstan). He was from the Chigil tribe and had the title Arslan Kara-Hakan. The western was the lesser Kagan, from the Yagma tribe, with the title Bogra Kara-Kagan and his court in Taraz, and later in Samarkand.S. G. Klyashtorny, T. I.

They migrated to Transoxania and Kashgharia.Z. V. Togan, \\"Turkistan Tarihi\\", Istanbul, 1947, p. 60, note 80 There are presently four villages in Turkey called Chigil, indicating that some Chigils migrated to Asia Minor after the Mongol invasion.Faruk Sumer, \\"Oguzlar\\", Ankara, 1967, p. 27 Religion The Chigil were known for their religious dedication. The first depictions of the Chigils describe them as adherents of Manichaeism. Later sources describe the Chigils as Nestorian Christians. The Zhetysu area, a former Chigil territory, is rich with Christian and pre-Christian archaeological remains, and the Talas area is especially saturated with religious monuments and historical reports. the Gagauzes, a distinct Pontic Turkic tribe known for their steadfast adherence to Greek Orthodox Christianity, have a folk legend associating their descent from the Chigils. In Manichaeism, the lion, mighty and ruthless king of animals, is a central image. This demonstrates an imported ideology; the lion is not native to Central Asia, and so it originally did not have symbolic significance for the population there. The building found by the archaeologists, without traces of economic activities, served as a chapel of the inhabitants depicted in long robes: the Chigils, whose symbol was a lion (Turk. Arslan, Bars).Yu.

The book was dedicated to the ruler (Beg) of the Chigil-Arslan tribes, named Il-Tirg√ºg, Ap-Burguchan, Alp- Tarhan [Henning, 1977, p. 552]. It was completed in Argu-Talas city (Altun Argu Talas).

They were planned after a thorough study of Japanese carrier designs. German naval architects ran into difficulties due to lack of experience in building such vessels, the situational realities of carrier operations in the North Sea and the lack of overall clarity in the ships' mission objectives. This lack of clarity led to features such as cruiser-type guns for commerce raiding and defense against British cruisers, that were either eliminated from or not included in American and Japanese carrier designs. American and Japanese carriers, designed along the lines of task-force defense, used supporting cruisers for surface firepower, which allowed flight operations to continue without disruption and kept carriers out of undue risk of damage or sinking from surface action. A combination of political infighting between the Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe, disputes within the ranks of the Kriegsmarine itself and Adolf Hitler's waning interest all conspired against the carriers. A shortage of workers and materials slowed construction still further and, in 1939, Raeder reduced the number of ships from four to two. Even so, the Luftwaffe trained its first unit of pilots for carrier service and readied it for flight operations. With the advent of World War II, priorities shifted to U-boat construction; one carrier, Flugzeugtr√§ger B, was broken up on the slipway while work on the other, Flugzeugtr√§ger A (christened Graf Zeppelin) was continued tentatively but suspended in 1940. The air unit scheduled for her was disbanded at that time. The role of aircraft in the Battle of Taranto, the pursuit of the German battleship , the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Battle of Midway demonstrated conclusively the usefulness of aircraft carriers in modern naval warfare. With Hitler's authorization, work resumed on the remaining carrier. Progress was again delayed, this time by the demand for newer planes specifically designed for carrier use and the need for modernizing the ship in light of wartime developments. Hitler's disenchantment with the performance of the Kriegsmarine's surface units led to a final stoppage of work. The ship was captured by the Soviet Union at the end of the war and sunk as a target ship in 1947. Design and construction Graf Zeppelin is launched, 8 December 1938. After 1933, the Kriegsmarine began to examine the possibility of building an aircraft carrier.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 226 Wilhelm Hadeler had been Assistant to the Professor of Naval Construction at the Technical University of Berlin for nine years when he was appointed to draft preliminary designs for an aircraft carrier in April 1934.Reynolds, p. 42 Hadeler's first design was a ship that could carry 50 aircraft and steam at . The Anglo-German Naval Agreement, signed on 18 June 1935, allowed Germany to construct aircraft carriers with total displacement up to 38,500 tons,Reynolds, p. 43 though Germany was limited to 35% of total British tonnage in any category of warship. The Kriegsmarine then decided to scale back Hadeler's design to , which would permit the construction of two ships within the 35% limit. The design staff decided that the new carrier would need to be able to defend itself against surface combatants, which necessitated armor protection to the standard of a heavy cruiser. A battery of sixteen guns were deemed sufficient to defend the ship from destroyers.Gardiner & Chesneau, pp. 226‚Äì227 In 1935, Adolf Hitler announced that Germany would construct aircraft carriers to strengthen the Kriegsmarine. A Luftwaffe officer, a naval officer, and a constructor visited Japan in the autumn of 1935 to obtain flight deck equipment blueprints and inspect the Japanese aircraft carrier .Reynolds, p. 44 The Germans also unsuccessfully attempted to examine the British carrier .Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 227 The keel of Graf Zeppelin was laid down on 28 December 1936, on the slipway that had recently held the battleship . The ship was built by the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel.Gr√∂ner, p. 71 Two years later, Gro√üadmiral (Grand Admiral) Erich Raeder presented an ambitious shipbuilding program called Plan Z which would build up the Kriegsmarine to a point where it could challenge the British Royal Navy in the North Sea. Under Plan Z, by 1945 as part of the balanced force the navy would have four carriers; the pair of Graf Zeppelin-class ships were the first two in the plan. Hitler approved the construction program on 1 March 1939.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 220 In 1938, a second carrier, ordered under the provisional name \\"B\\", was laid down at the Germaniawerft dockyard in Kiel.Gr√∂ner, pp. 71‚Äì72 Graf Zeppelin was launched on 8 December 1938.Gr√∂ner, p. 72 Design=Hull Graf Zeppelin at Kiel, June 1940, displaying her newly rebuilt bow. Also visible are her 15 cm casemate guns, before their removal to defend occupied Norway. The photo is marked Geheim (\\"secret\\"). The Graf Zeppelin class's hull was divided into 19 watertight compartments, the standard division for all capital ships in the Kriegsmarine.Breyer, p. 33 Their belt armor was to vary from over the machinery spaces and aft magazines, to over the forward magazines and tapered down to at the bows. Stern armor was kept at to protect the steering gear. Inboard of the main armor belt was a anti- torpedo bulkhead.Whitley (1985), p. 157 Horizontal armor protection against aerial bombs and plunging shellfire started with the flight deck, which acted as the main strength deck. The armor was generally thick except for those areas around the elevator shafts and funnel uptakes where thickness increased to in order to give the elevators necessary structural strength and the critical uptakes greater splinter protection. Beneath the lower hangar was the main armored deck (or tween deck) where armor thickness varied from over the magazines to over the machinery spaces. Along the peripheries, it formed a 45 degree slope where it joined the lower portion of the waterline belt armor. The Graf Zeppelins original length-to-beam ratio was 9.26:1, resulting in a slender silhouette. However, in May 1942, the accumulating top-weight of recent design changes required the addition of deep bulges to either side of Graf Zeppelins hull, decreasing that ratio to 8.33:1 and giving her the widest beam of any carrier designed prior to 1942.Brown, p. 9 The bulges served mainly to improve Graf Zeppelins stability but they also gave her an added degree of anti-torpedo protection and increased her operating range because selected compartments were designed to store approximately 1500 additional tons of fuel oil.Whitley (1984), p. 31 Graf Zeppelins straight-stemmed prow was rebuilt in early 1940 with the addition of a more sharply angled \\"Atlantic prow\\", intended to improve overall seakeeping. This added to her overall length.Breyer, p. 33 Machinery The Graf Zeppelin class's power plant was to consist of 16 La Mont high-pressure boilers, similar to those used in the heavy cruisers. Their four sets of geared turbines, connected to four shafts, were expected to produce and propel the carrier at a top speed of . With a maximum bunkerage capacity of 5000 tons of fuel oil (prior to the addition of bulges in 1942), the Graf Zeppelins calculated radius of action was at . However, wartime experience on ships with similar power plants showed such estimates were highly inaccurate, and actual operational ranges tended to be much lower.Whitley (1985), p. 159 Two Voith-Schneider cycloidal propeller- rudders were to be installed in the forward bow of the ship along the center- line. These were intended to assist in berthing the ship in harbor and also in negotiating narrow waterways such as the Kiel Canal where, due to the carrier's high freeboard and difficulty in maneuvering at speeds below , gusting winds might push the ship into the canal sides. In an emergency, the units could have been used to steer the ships at speeds under and, if the ships' main engines were rendered inoperable, could propel the vessel at a speed of in calm seas. When not in use, they were to be retracted into their vertical shafts and protected by water-tight covers. Flight deck and hangarsFlight deck= The Graf Zeppelins steel flight deck, overlaid with wooden planking, was long by wide at its maximum. It had a slight round down right aft and overhung the main superstructure but not the stern; being supported by steel girders. At the bow, the carriers were to have an open forecastle and the leading edge of her flight deck was uneven (mainly due to the blunt ends of her catapult tracks), but it did not appear likely that would have caused any undue air turbulence. Careful wind-tunnel studies using models confirmed this, but they also revealed that their long low island structure would generate a vortex over the flight deck in these tests when the ship yawed to port. This was considered to be an acceptable hazard when conducting air operations.Brown, p. 10 =Hangars= The Graf Zeppelin class's upper and lower hangars were long and narrow with unarmored sides and ends. Workshops, stores and crew quarters were located outboard of the hangars, a design feature similar to that of British carriers. The upper hangar measured x ; the lower hangar x . The upper hangar had vertical clearance while the lower hangar had less headroom due to the ceiling braces. Total usable hangar space was with stowage for 43 aircraft: 20 Fieseler Fi 167 torpedo bombers, 18 in the lower hangar, two in the upper hangar; 13 Junkers Ju 87C dive bombers in the upper hangar and 10 Messerschmitt Bf 109T fighters in the upper hangar.Breyer, p. 52 =Elevators= The Graf Zeppelin class had three electrically operated elevators positioned along the flight-deck's center-line: one near the bow, abreast the forward end of the island; one amidships; and one aft. They were octagonal in shape, measuring x , and were designed to transfer aircraft weighing up to 5.5 tons between decks.Whitley (1985), p. 155Breyer, p. 54 =Launch catapults= Two Deutsche Werke compressed air-driven telescoping catapults were installed at the forward end of the flight deck for power-assisted launches. They were long and designed to accelerate a fighter to a speed of approximately and a bomber to . A dual set of rails led back from the catapults to the forward and midship elevators. In the hangars, aircraft were to be hoisted by crane - a method also proposed for the Essex-class carriers of the United States Navy, but rejected as too time- consuming - onto collapsible launch trolleys. The aircraft/trolley combination would then be lifted to flight deck level on the elevator and trundled along the rails to the catapult start points. When the catapults were triggered, a burst of compressed air would propel moveable slideways within the catapult track wells forward.Wagner & Wilske, pp. 54‚Äì56 As each plane lifted off, its launch trolley would reach the end of the slideway but remain locked in place until the tow attachment cables were released. Once the slideways were retracted back into the catapult track wells and the tow cables unhooked, the launch trollies would be manually pushed forward onto recovery platforms, lowered to the forecastle on \\"B\\" deck, then rolled back into the upper hangar for re-use via a secondary set of rails. When not in use, the catapult tracks were to be covered with sheet metal farings to protect them from harsh weather. Eighteen aircraft could have theoretically been launched at a rate of one every 30 seconds before exhausting the catapult air reservoirs. It would then have taken 50 minutes to recharge the reservoirs. The two large cylinders holding the compressed air were housed in insulated compartments located between the two catapult tracks, below flight deck level but above the main armored deck. This positioning afforded them only light protection from potential battle damage. The insulated compartments were to be electrically heated to a temperature of in order to prevent ice from forming on the cylinder piping and control equipment as the compressed air was vented during launches.Burke, p. 87 It was intended from the outset that all of the Graf Zeppelins aircraft would normally launch via catapult. Rolling take-offs would be performed only in an emergency or if the catapults were inoperable due to battle damage or mechanical failure. Whether this practice would have been strictly adhered to or later modified, based on actual air trials and combat experience is open to question, especially given the limited capacity of the air reservoirs and the long recharging times necessary between launches. One advantage of such a system, however, was that the Graf Zeppelins could have launched their aircraft without need for turning the ship into the wind or under conditions where the prevailing winds were too light to provide enough lift for her heavier aircraft. They could also have launched and landed aircraft simultaneously.Marshall, p. 23 To facilitate rapid catapult launches and eliminate the necessity of time-consuming engine warm-ups, up to eight aircraft were to be kept in readiness aboard the German carriers on their hangar decks by the use of steam pre-heaters. These would keep the aircraft engines at an operational temperature of . In addition, engine oil was to be kept warmed in separate holding tanks, then added via hand-pumps to the aircraft engines shortly before launch. Once the aircraft were raised to flight deck level via the elevators, aircraft oil temperature could be maintained, if need be, through the use of electric pre-heaters plugged into power points on the flight deck. Otherwise, the aircraft could have been immediately catapult-launched as their engines would already have been at or near normal operating temperature.Burke, p. 86 =Arresting gear= Four arrester wires were positioned at the after end of the flight deck with two more emergency wires located afore and abaft of the amidships elevator. Original drawings show four additional wires fore and aft of the forward lift, possibly intended to allow recovery of aircraft over the bows, but these may have been deleted from the ship's final configuration. To assist with night landings, the arrester wires were to be illuminated with neon lights. =Wind barriers= Two high, slitted steel wind barriers were installed afore the midships and forward elevators. These were designed to reduce wind velocity over the flight deck to a distance of approximately behind them. When not in use they could be lowered flush with the deck to allow aircraft to pass over them. =Island= The position of Graf Zeppelins superstructure in relation to the flight deck. The Graf Zeppelins starboard-side island housed the command and navigating bridges and charthouse. It also served as a platform for three searchlights, four domed stabilized fire-control directors and a large vertical funnel. To compensate for the weight of the island, the carrier's flight deck and hangars were offset to port from her longitudinal axis. Design additions proposed in 1942 included a tall fighter-director tower, air search radar antennas and a curved cap for her funnel, the latter intended to keep smoke and exhaust gases away from the armored fighter- director cabin.Breyer, p. 18 Armament The Graf Zeppelins were to be armed with separate high and low angle guns for AA and anti-ship defense at a time when most other major navies were switching to dual-purpose AA weapons and relying on escort ships to protect their carriers from surface threats. Her primary anti-shipping armament consisted of sixteen SK C/28 guns paired in eight armored casemates. These were mounted, two each, at the four corners of the carriers' upper hangar deck, positions that raised the possibility the guns would be washed out in heavy seas, especially those in the forward casemates. Chief Engineer Hadeler had originally planned for only eight such weapons on the carriers, four on each side in single mountings. However, the Naval Armaments Office misinterpreted his proposal to save space by pairing them and instead doubled the number of guns to 16, resulting in a need for increased ammunition stowage and more electrically operated hoists to service them.Breyer, p. 43 Later in Graf Zeppelins construction, some consideration was given to deleting these guns and replacing them with SK C/33 guns mounted on sponsons just below flight deck level. But the structural modifications needed to accommodate such a change were judged too difficult and time- consuming, requiring major changes to the ship's design, and the matter was shelved.Breyer, p. 44 Primary AA protection came from 12 guns, paired in six turrets positioned three afore and three aft of the carrier's island. Potential blast damage to planes sited on the flight deck when these guns fired to port was an unavoidable risk and would have limited any flight activity during an engagement. The Graf Zeppelin class's secondary AA defenses consisted of 11 twin SK C/30 guns mounted on sponsons located along the flight deck edges: four on the starboard side, six to port and one mounted on the ship's forecastle. In addition, seven MG C/30 guns were installed on single- mount platforms on either side of the carrier: four to port and three to starboard. These guns were later changed to Flakvierling mountings.Breyer, p. 48 Flight testing at Travem√ºnde In 1937, with Graf Zeppelins launch scheduled for the end of the following year, the Luftwaffe's experimental test facility at Travem√ºnde (Erprobungsstelle See or E-Stelle See) on the Baltic coast - one of the four such Erprobungstelle facilities of the Third Reich, with the headquarters at Rechlin - began a lengthy program of testing prototype carrier aircraft. This included performing simulated carrier landings and take-offs and training future carrier pilots.Reynolds, p. 46 The runway was painted with a contoured outline of Graf Zeppelins flight deck and simulated deck landings were then conducted over an arresting cable strung width-wise across the airstrip. The cable was attached to an electromechanical braking device manufactured by DEMAG (Deutsche Maschinenfabrik A.G. Duisburg). Testing began in March 1938 using the Heinkel He 50, Arado Ar 195 and Ar 197. Later, a stronger braking winch was supplied by Atlas-Werke of Bremen and this allowed heavier aircraft, such as the Fieseler Fi 167 and Junkers Ju 87, to be tested.Israel, p. 66 After some initial problems, Luftwaffe pilots performed 1,500 successful braked landings out of 1,800 attempted.Breyer, p. 66 Launches were practiced using a long barge-mounted pneumatic catapult, moored in the Trave River estuary. The Heinkel-designed catapult, built by Deutsche Werke Kiel (DWK), could accelerate aircraft to speeds of depending on wind conditions. Test planes were first hoisted by crane onto collapsible launch carriages in the same manner as intended on Graf Zeppelin.Breyer, p. 67 The catapult test program began in April 1940 and, by early May, 36 launches had been conducted, all carefully documented and filmed for later study: 17 by Arado Ar 197s, 15 by modified Junkers Ju 87Bs and four using a modified Messerschmitt Bf 109D. Further testing followed, and by June Luftwaffe officials were fully satisfied with the catapult system's performance.Israel, p. 65 Aircraft A Bf 109T-1 The expected role of the Graf Zeppelin class was that of a seagoing scouting platform and her initial planned air group reflected that emphasis: 20 Fieseler Fi 167 biplanes for scouting and torpedo attack, 10 Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters, and 13 Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers. This was later changed to 30 Bf 109 fighters and 12 Ju 87 dive-bombers as carrier doctrine in Japan, Great Britain and the United States shifted away from purely reconnaissance duties toward offensive combat missions. In late 1938, the Technische Amt RLM (Technical Office of the Reichsluftfahrtministerium or State Ministry of Aviation) requested that Messerschmitt's Augsburg design bureau draw up plans for a carrier-borne version of the Bf 109E fighter, to be designated Bf 109T (the \\"T\\" standing for Tr√§ger or Carrier).Marshall, p. 16 By December 1940, the RLM decided to complete only seven carrier-equipped Bf 109T-1s and to finish the remainder as land-based T-2s since work on Graf Zeppelin had ceased back in April and there appeared to be little likelihood she would then be commissioned any time soon.Marshall, p. 24 When work on Graf Zeppelin ceased, the T-2s were deployed to Norway. At the end of 1941, when interest in completing Graf Zeppelin revived, the surviving Bf 109 T-2s were withdrawn from front-line service in order to again prepare them for possible carrier duty. Seven T-2s were rebuilt to T-1 standards and handed over to the Kriegsmarine on 19 May 1942. By December, a total of 48 Bf 109T-2s had been converted back into T-1s. 46 of these were stationed at Pillau in East Prussia and reserved for use aboard the carrier. By February 1943, all work on Graf Zeppelin had ceased and the aircraft were returned to Luftwaffe service in April.Breyer, p. 69 A Fieseler Fi 167, the fifth of 12 pre-production machines, banks through the clouds on a test flight. When work on Graf Zeppelin was suspended in May 1940, the 12 completed Fi 167s were organized into Erprobungsstaffel 167 for the purpose of conducting further operational trials. By the time work on the carrier resumed two years later in May 1942, the Fi 167 was no longer considered adequate for its intended role and the Technische Amt decided to replace it with a modified torpedo-carrying version of the Junkers Ju 87D.Green, p. 169 Ten Ju 87C-0 pre- production aircraft were built and sent to the testing facilities at Rechlin and Travem√ºnde where they underwent extensive service trials, including catapult launches and simulated deck landings. Of the 170 Ju 87C-1 ordered, only a few saw completion, suspension of work on Graf Zeppelin in May 1940 resulting in cancellation of the entire order. Existing aircraft and those airframes in process were eventually converted back into Ju 87B-2s.Breyer, p. 72 Work on developing a torpedo-carrying version of the Ju 87D for anti- shipping sorties in the Mediterranean had already commenced in early 1942 when the possibility again arose that Graf Zeppelin might be completed. As the Fieseler Fi 167 was now considered obsolete, the Technische Amt requested that Junkers modify the Ju 87D-4 into a carrier-borne torpedo-bomber/recon plane to be designated Ju 87E-1. But when all further work on Graf Zeppelin was halted for good in February 1943, the entire order was canceled. None of the Ju 87Ds converted to carry a torpedo were used operationally.Breyer, p. 73 By May 1942, when work was ordered resumed on Graf Zeppelin, the older Bf 109T carrier-borne fighter was considered obsolete. By September 1942 detailed plans for the new fighter, the Me 155, were completed. When it became apparent Graf Zeppelin would not be commissioned for at least another two years, Messerschmitt was unofficially told to shelve the projected fighter design. No prototype of the carrier-borne version of the plane was ever constructed.Green, p. 88 On 1 August 1938, four months prior to Graf Zeppelins launch date, the Luftwaffe formed its first carrier-based air unit, designated Tr√§gergruppe I/186, on Rugia Island near Burg. It was composed of three squadrons (Staffeln) and was intended to serve aboard both carriers when completed. By October shipyard construction delays resulted in disbandment of the air group as it was considered too large and costly to maintain given the uncertainty over when the two vessels would be ready for sea trials. Instead, on 1 November that same year a single fighter squadron (Tr√§gerjagdstaffel) was created, 6./186, and placed under the command of Cpt. Heinrich Seeliger.Breyer, p. 55 Later, a dive bomber squadron was added, 4./186, equipped with Ju 87Bs under Cpt. Blattner. Six months after, in July 1939, a second fighter squadron was formed, 5./186, under Oberleutnant Gerhard Kadow and partly staffed with pilots culled from 6./186. By August the three squadrons were reorganised into Tr√§gergruppe II/186 under the command of Major Walter Hagen in anticipation that Graf Zeppelin would be ready for service trials by the summer of 1940.Breyer, p. 55 Ships in class Stettin, mid-1941. The improved \\"Atlantic bow\\", the two empty openings for the 15cm (5.9-inch) gun casemates (just below and forward of the funnel), the telescoping masts and the ends of the twin catapult tracks on the flight deck are all visible. Graf Zeppelin in September 1937, with her armored deck under construction Construction on the Kriegsmarines two aircraft carriers had been fitful from the start due to a shortage of welders and delays in obtaining materials. Flugzeugtr√§ger A Graf Zeppelin  Work started on Flugzeugtr√§ger A in 1936. She was laid down on 28 December that year, and launched on 8 December 1938. She was incomplete by April 1940, when a changed strategic situation led to work on her being suspended.Whitley (1984), p. 30 By early 1942 the usefulness of aircraft carriers in modern naval warfare had been amply demonstrated, and on 13 May 1942, with Hitler's authorization, the German Naval Supreme Command ordered work resumed on the carrier.Reynolds, p. 47 With technical problems, such as the demand for newer planes specifically designed for carrier use, and the need for modernization, progress was delayed. The German naval staff hoped all these changes could be accomplished by April 1943, with the carrier's first sea trials taking place that August. By late January 1943 Hitler had become so disenchanted with the Kriegsmarine, especially with what he perceived as the poor performance of its surface fleet, that he ordered all of its larger ships taken out of service and scrapped. As of 2 February 1943, construction on the carrier ended for good. Graf Zeppelin languished for the next two years in various Baltic ports. On 25 April 1945, she was scuttled at Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland), ahead of the advancing Red Army.Breyer, p. 32 The ship was subsequently raised by the SovietsChesneau, pp. 76-77, 190 and was used for target practice and sunk in 1947. Her wreck was discovered in 2006 by Polish researchers in the Baltic off W≈Çadys≈Çawowo, at the head of the Hel Peninsula. Flugzeugtr√§ger B The contract to build the ship was awarded to the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft in Kiel in 1938, with a planned launch date on 1 July 1940. Work on Flugzeugtr√§ger B began in 1938 but was halted on 19 September 1939 because, now that Germany was at war with Great Britain and France, priority had shifted to U-boat construction. The hull, completed only up to the armored deck, sat rusting on its slipway until 28 February 1940, when Admiral Raeder ordered her broken up and scrapped.Breyer, p. 14 Scrapping was completed four months later. The Kriegsmarine never named a vessel before it was launched, so it was only given the designation \\"B\\" (\\"A\\" was Graf Zeppelins designation before launch). Had it been completed, the aircraft carrier could have been named Peter Strasser in honor of the World War I leader of the naval airships Peter Strasser.Ireland, p. 176 Flugzeugtr√§ger C and D In 1937, the Kriegsmarine planned two additional aircraft carriers of the Graf Zeppelin class with the official designations C and D. Both these carriers were planned to be operational by 1943. However, by the end of 1938, this plan was changed to only build these two carriers plus any further units as smaller carriers.Carl Dreessen: \\"Die deutsche Flottenr√ºstung.\\" Mittler & Sohn.

Power supply studs were set in the road at intervals and connected to a buried electric cable by switches operated by magnets on the tramcars. Current was collected from the studs by a \\"skate\\" or \\"ski collector\\" under the tramcar. The system was popular for a while in the early 1900s but soon fell out of favour because of the unreliability of the magnetic switches, largely born out of the friction and corrosion of its cast iron moving components. In recent years the concept has made a comeback, to remove overhead supply systems from scenically sensitive areas. Current manufacturing methods and electronic control means such systems are much more reliable. The new tram system in Bordeaux, France has resurrected the system in the form of Alimentation par le sol for aesthetic reasons in the city centre. Studs Power supply studs are the fixed contact elements of a stud/skate or stud/ski collector electrical connection system. They are used when a moving element needs to be in electrical contact with a static element. The main advantage of the system is the self-cleaning facility of the skate/ski with the stud. The stud contact system or surface contact system was used with some tramway systems. It is used especially where an overhead system would be obtrusive. As the studs would be on open roads rather than special track, methods have to be adopted to ensure that they are only live when under a vehicle. Early systems used mechanical switches. Most use magnetic activation from a magnet on the vehicle, but a few used a purely mechanical system. Systems in use in the early part of the 20th century included the Lorain, Dolter, and GB surface- contact systems, which were all magnetically operated, and the Robrow surface- contact system, which was mechanical. In practice the technology of the time could be erratic. This meant studs that did not make contact when activated, and studs that remain live after the vehicle had passed over. Consequently the systems tended to be replaced with either overhead systems, or continuous contact sub surface systems. Collectors Most electric railway systems take the power from an external generator. This means the electricity has to be collected while the locomotive is on the move. In this context a locomotive refers to any electric vehicle on a railway track or tramway track. Other than railways the other most common system of electrically powered guided transport is a tramway system. Generally electric locomotives collect power through a third rail or an overhead wire. The full circuit is completed by track rails. For main line railways with their protected lines overhead lines and third rails are not a problem. Tramways operate in cities. This means that the third rail system is not really practical. It has been used, protection being offered to other road users by placing it in a central groove. Even so the ingress of dirt and water can cause problems. An alternative solution is to use studs. All the systems have a switch in the stud and a means to switch on the stud only while it is covered by the moving vehicle. As at least one stud must be covered by the collector at all times a long collector is used. The length has to be slightly greater than the maximum distance between any two studs. This collector is known as a skate or ski collector. This type of electrical power collector needs to move in the vertical plane to allow for natural differences in the height of the power supply studs. It is used on some full size tramway systems where there is a need for overhead wires not to be used, usually in areas of scenic value. Model railways The stud contact system is also used on model railway systems (e.g. M√§rklin) as the center line of studs is less obtrusive than a single central rail. For outdoor model railway systems the use of a stud supply system with a skate/ski collector has certain practical advantages. The system is inherently self-cleaning. While the track may not be perfect, with both rails acting as the return part of the system in parallel electrical pick up problems are substantially reduced. Non-railway applications While the obvious use is on railway power collection, the system also has applications wherever electrical energy needs to be transferred from a static source to moving user, or vice versa. Systems Share of the Soc. Civile des Redevances \\"Diatto\\", issued 2. March 1900 with illustrations of the Diatto studs The Doulter stud system in use at Torquay from 1907 until 1911 Brown The Brown Surface Contact System was manufactured by Lorain. Diatto The Diatto stud system was the most common in France, with over 20,000 studs in use. It was invented by an Italian, Alfredo Diatto of Turin and was first installed in Tours in 1899, followed by four of the Paris tramway companies in 1900. Dolter For the Dolter system a conductor cable was laid in a trench between the rails. At intervals a box was fitted between the rails that contained a stud (which protruded about above the road) and a bell crank. A magnet on a passing tram attracted this crank which then moved to make contact between the conductor cable and stud; once the tram moved away the crank dropped away and the stud was no longer connected to the cable. A long skate was suspended beneath each tramcar which was magnetised by electro-magnets and so both operated the cranks and collected the current that both moved the tram car and powered the electro-magnets. A small battery was carried to charge the electro-magnets should the power be interrupted. The negative return current passed through the rails. The town council of Torquay did not want their seaside resort disfigured by the poles and overhead wires of a conventional electric tramway and so invited the Dolter Electric Traction Company to construct a tramway using their stud-contact system. A horse was killed after it stepped on a live stud during construction of the Torquay Tramways. Each tram car was then fitted with a bell connected to a special contact arm to warn the driver if a stud remained live after it had passed. The conductor of the tram then had to reset the crank using an insulated mallet. During the Board of Trade inspection of the tramway four such studs were detected during about of tests. There were also frequent problems with trams being stopped when a stud failed to be made live when needed. The network covered and opened in stages during 1907 and 1908. On 27 January 1910 a snow storm stopped all the trams as they couldn't make contact with the studs. It was converted to overhead collection in 1911 shortly before it was extended to Paignton where the town council had refused to allow the Dolter system to be used. A short Dolter system also opened in 1907 in Hastings along the seafront to connect two sections of a network that otherwise used overhead collection. It lasted until 1913. For the next eight years the trams that worked along Hastings sea front were fitted with a small motor to enable them to move between the two sections of overhead wire, but in 1921 wires were provided along the section. The Mexborough & Swinton Tramway used the Dolter system from 1907 until 1908 when it was converted to overhead supply.

Early life Weigall was the fourth son of the Rev. Edward Weigall by his wife, Cecelia Bythesea Brome and was educated at Macclesfield Grammar School and Brasenose College, Oxford. He received second class honours in Literae Humaniores in 1862, and the following year travelled to Australia after a sea voyage was recommended for him to recover from illness. Career Weigall settled in Melbourne, teaching primarily classics at Scotch College, Melbourne under Alexander Morrison for three years. His cousin Theyre Weigall was able to introduce him to some influential friends, and in 1866 he applied for the position of headmaster at Sydney Grammar School, took up the role in January 1867. At the beginning of the 1867 academic year there were only 53 boys at Sydney Grammar; this grew to 696 boys in Weigall's last year as headmaster. Indeed, when he arrived the school was in a particularly perilous situation, as the previous headmaster William Stephens departed after a conflict over corporal punishment with the school trustees. He had left to form a new school at Darlinghurst, taking fifty students with him. Weigall sought to rebuild the school by instilling the value of academic achievement, as well as build character through sporting activities. He introduced the school magazine The Sydneian, and a prefect system in 1878. Weigall guided the school's teachers, some of whom had arrived from England after being educated at the great public schools there, to impart a similar atmosphere at Sydney Grammar School. For example, he and Henry Anderson formed the school cadet corps in 1870, and the following year Weigall became captain of the corps. Late life and legacy Weigall's interest almost exclusively lay with his role as Headmaster of Sydney Grammar School. He finally took a year off in 1893, and although he later returned and would remain headmaster until his death, he was plagued by illness in the latter part of his life. He died on 20 February 1912. He was lauded by past students and the school trustees for his leadership. The land the school had purchased in 1907 at Rushcutters Bay was named the Weigall Playing Fields; Weigall had strongly advocated for sporting grounds for the students of the school. He was married to Ada Frances Raymond in 1868, and had four sons and four daughters. Among them was Cecil Weigall, a prominent barrister.

Its narrative centers on the life and death of Zeno, a physician, philosopher, scientist and alchemist born in Bruges during the Renaissance era. The book was published in France in 1968 and was met with immediate popular interest as well as critical acclaim, obtaining the Prix Femina with unanimous votes the year of its publication. The English translation by Grace Frick has been published under the title The Abyss or alternatively Zeno of Bruges. Belgian filmmaker Andr√© Delvaux adapted it into a film in 1988. Plot Zeno, an illegitimate son, is born in the Ligre household, a rich banking family of Bruges. Zeno renounces a comfortable career in the priesthood and leaves home to find truth at the age of 20. In his youth, after leaving Bruges, he greedily seeks knowledge by roaming the roads of Europe and beyond, leaving in his wake a nearly legendary -- but also dangerous -- reputation of genius due to the works he accomplishes. Themes The novel is set principally in Flanders of the 16th century, in the period opening the Early modern era of booming capitalistic economy, of renewed approaches to sciences, of religious upheavals (notably the M√ºnster Rebellion) and bloody counter-Reformation, to the background of incessant wars between countries and the creeping chaos of the Black Death. In this setting, Zeno, the main character, is portrayed as a Renaissance Man of great intelligence and talent whose freedom of thoughts will come to be tested by the confines of his time. Title The French title L'Oeuvre au noir refers to the first step (nigredo) of the three steps the completion of which is required to achieve the Magnum opus in the discipline of alchemy, whose ultimate goal is to transmute lesser metals into gold or to create the Philosopher's stone. In Yourcenar's own words, \\"In alchemical treatises, the formula L'Oeuvre au Noir, designates what is said to be the most difficult phase of the alchemist's process, the separation and dissolution of substance. It is still not clear whether the term applied to daring experiments on matter itself, or whether it was understood to symbolize trials of the mind in discarding all forms of routine and prejudice. Doubtless it signified one or the other meaning alternately, or perhaps both at the same time.\\"Note of the author accompanying the novel. Also: Reflections on the Composition of \\"The Abyss\\", by Marguerite Yourcenar, Litt√©R√©alit√©, Vol 5 No 1, 1993 York University The English title The Abyss gives a slightly different lead by the evocation of fathomless depths, a likely image of the alchemist's inner journey, which are at the same time a Christian vision of hell, to which his contemporaries may wish to condemn him.

It was originally developed by Transurban for use on their CityLink tollway in the late 1990s, with the system since adopted by all toll roads, bridges and tunnels in Australia. The technology has different names depending on the issuer - such as Eastlink (Eastlink Melbourne), Linkt (Queensland), E-toll (Roads & Traffic Authority NSW) and E-way (Sydney motorways M5 and M1), however these are all interchangeable across Australia and no surcharges apply for use on other operators' toll roads. Toll roads in Australia use free-flow tolling, with no toll booths along the entire length of the system to impede traffic flow. Australia was one of the first countries in the world to have complete, surcharge-free interoperability between rival tolling providers across different state roadway systems. In July 2007, both e-TAG and e-pass video tolling arrangements were introduced in the Sydney Harbour Tunnel, Westlink M7, Cross City Tunnel and the Lane Cove Tunnel. This measure substantially eased traffic jams heading towards electronic gantries, providing increased convenience and time savings. In early 2009, the Sydney Harbour Bridge became toll-booth free, requiring e-TAGs to be used. There are over 850,000 e-TAG account customers, and over 1 million e-TAGs have been issued. Technology The e-TAG electronic tolling is based on radio-frequency identification (RFID) transponders using the DSRC protocol. The system uses electronic transponders (called e-TAGs) mounted on the inside of the vehicles' windscreen. Gantries constructed over each carriageway record registration plates and detect the e-TAGs. As the vehicle continues along the toll road, additional gantries monitor the distance travelled. Associated software then determines the toll amount payable, which is automatically deducted from the prepaid account associated with the tag. Where a tag is not detected, the vehicle's registration is recorded using video tolling technology which incorporates an automatic number plate recognition system and checked against a government motor registration database. For infrequent use of the system a user can buy a Daypass ‚Äì by phone, online, at any Australia Post outlet or at participating service stations. A Daypass can be bought in advance or afterwards (until midnight three days later). If payment has not been made after three days, the vehicle's registered owner will be sent a late toll invoice in the mail, and if the late toll invoice is then not paid a fine will be issued. In Victoria fines are issued by Civic Compliance Victoria. The life of the battery in an e-TAGs is approximately 5 years. Customers are advised when a device is about to expire and to contact the issuer should their e-TAG not beep as they pass a tolling gantry, to receive a replacement device.

History NMBS-SNCB wanted to gain experiences with high-powered diesel locomotives, with a possible order following if the tests would prove successful. As locomotive 200.001 was due for a large revision it was decided to rebuild this locomotive with a 4000 hp Cockerill engine. It was planned to give the locomotive the number 200.101, but as the rebuilding took some 2 years and a half, much longer than expected, it was directly given the new number 5001, in line with the large renumbering in 1971. Apart from the new 16-cylinder engine it was also equipped with electric train heating, which replaced the steam generator. Career After the locomotive was converted it was first trialled and put in commercial service. During both trials and commercial service it proved to be very unreliable and was spending more time in workshops than it was running on the track. In 1976 the trials were stopped as NMBS-SNCB decided that it didn't need a high-power diesel locomotive anymore. Upon this decision it was first stabled at Kinkempois workshops and later at the shed in Latour. After some time the locomotive was sent to the Salzinnes workshops to be converted back into a standard class 51 locomotive. It received the engine of HLD 5176 which was damaged in an accident, but whose engine was still intact. In 1980 it was back put into service as a standard class 51 locomotive under number 5101.

He scored all but two of his 63 victories against the Western Allies whilst flying the Messerschmitt Bf 109, and was one of the top scoring aces in the North African campaign.Spick, p.240.  Military career  Homuth initially served in the Kriegsmarine before joining the Luftwaffe in 1935. During 1937‚Äì1938, he was a member of the Luftwaffe aerobatic team, and part of 2.(J)/Lehrgeschwader 2 (LG 2‚Äî2nd Demonstration Wing). In October 1939, Homuth was appointed Adjutant of I./Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27‚Äî27th Fighter Wing), becoming Staffelkapit√§n (Squadron Leader) of 3./JG 27 in February 1940. He gained his first victory on 11 May, shooting down a Bristol Blenheim. By the end of the French campaign Homuth had nine victories, and added a further six victories during the Battle of Britain, becoming one of the more successful 'stars' within Jagdgeschwader 27, which had suffered severe losses for little achievement during the Battle. In April 1941, I./JG 27 was the first Luftwaffe fighter group to be sent to North Africa. Oberleutnant Homuth was awarded the Ritterkreuz in June for 22 victories. By January 1942, Homuth had 39 victories. His impressive record and leadership talents meant Homuth was appointed Gruppenkommandeur of I./JG 27 in June 1942. His 60th claim came on 27 October, when he shot down a Spitfire over Bir Mumim Busak. Coinciding with the withdrawal of I./JG 27 from North Africa, Homuth fell ill and was taken off operational flying. In February 1943 he was posted to Sofia as an instructor training Bulgarian fighter pilots. Homuth returned to front line duty in July 1943 as Gruppenkommandeur (Group Commander) I./JG 54 based in the Northern sector of the Eastern Front and flying the Fw 190A. On 2 August 1943, on one of his first combat missions, Homuth was engaged in a dogfight with Soviet fighters. He finally managed to shoot down a P-39 Airacobra, however Homuth failed to return from this mission and was posted missing in action. His exact fate remains unknown. Gerhard Homuth was credited with 63 victories in approximately 450 missions, 47 in Africa. He recorded two victories over the Eastern Front. His older brother was killed in action in 1942 on the Eastern Front, his father was shot by looting soldiers on 23 April 1945.Obermaier 1989, p. 136.

During 1993 Class 21 locomotive 2130 was converted for use as a test bed for the development of future class 13. It was renumbered into Class 19 as 1901 for the testing program and was the only member of the class. The traction motors were replaced with asynchronous motors. It also gained a transformer that let it work under 25000 volts, 50 Hz AC and French signalling and train protection systems. The 3000 Volts DC capability was retained. The reason for this was because Class 13 was to be a dual voltage locomotive running on the same voltages with the same type of motors. 1901 operated into Lille Flandres station in France many times as part of the testing process. By 2001 the testing was completed and it was restored to standard with its original number of 2130. In 2014 the SNCB decided to stop the first half of Class 21 (2101-2130). Part of this was because they had too many electric locomotives and part of it was because there was a need for otherwise unobtainable spare parts to keep Class 27 in service. These Class 21s will have their asbestos removed and be stripped of parts and scrapped in the near future.

He was originally a supporting character in Minnie the Minx by Leo Baxendale, but eventually received his own spin-off comic. Character As his name suggests, Fatty Fudge is an obese boy with an addiction to unhealthy food, particularly confectionery. He is very greedy and would do anything for food, which Minnie often uses to her advantage. He is largely confined to supporting roles in the Minnie the Minx cartoon strip in which, alongside Minnie's other rival Soppy Susan, he is usually the butt of Minnie's pranks, although his services are occasionally engaged by Minnie for the furtherance of her schemes. His real name is Frederick James Fudge.  Family  He has a son named Frederick Fudge Jr.  In other media  Fatty appears in \\"Jelly Babies\\" in The Beano Videostars, voiced by Enn Reitel. Spin-off From 1989‚Äì1991, however, Fatty had his own spin-off strip devoted entirely to the parodying of famous films. Examples of this include Ghost Burgers, Toast Busters (both puns on Ghostbusters), You only eat Rice (You Only Live Twice), Sleeping Fatty (Sleeping Beauty), Frankfurterstein (Frankenstein), Fishfinger (Goldfinger), Live and Let Diet (Live and Let Die), The Incredible Bulk (The Incredible Hulk), 2001: A Space Obesity (2001: A Space Odyssey), and 20,000 Leeks Under the Sea (20.000 Leagues Under the Sea). He also appeared in a parody of the British quiz show Bob's Full House, called \\"Slob's Full Tum\\", where contestants had to eat as much as they could and whoever got a full tum in the quickest time was the winner. The game show was hosted by \\"Slob Monkhouse\\", again a parody of the original host name Bob Monkhouse. These strips were all drawn by Jim Petrie, the Minnie the Minx artist at that time. The strip reappeared in Issue 3616, dated 17 December 2011, it was so former artist Jim Petrie could get a proper retirement. The comic asked for ideas for the strip on Beano.com. In the end, the winning idea was \\"The Tummy Returns\\", suggested by William Clyde, this appeared in the comic. Other suggestions that were considered good by Petrie included: \\"Iron (stomach) Man\\" (Iron Man), \\"A-lard-in\\" (Aladdin), \\"Harry Scoffer and the order on Phoenix Street\\" (Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix), all from Harry Rickard, \\"Currynation Street\\" (Coronation Street) and \\"The Fat in the Hat\\" (The Cat in the Hat), both by Oliver Forde.

Hans F√§hrmann Life Hans F√§hrmann was the son of the local school teacher and cantor. At an early age his basic musical education was taken in hand by his strict father - his piano lessons began when he was five-and-a-half. At the age of 12 he began organ lessons, and was called on regularly to play the organ as deputy at church services. At the age of 14, in 1874, he passed the entrance examination at the teacher training college in Dresden-Friedrichstadt with outstanding success - his interpretation of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 1 in F minor caused a sensation. He studied there until 1880. He worked as an assistant teacher in Pieschen until 1882, and as a result of his teaching skills he was exempted from one year of studies. In 1882 Hans F√§hrmann devoted himself fully to music, and until 1890 he studied privately with teachers of his own choice (piano studies with Hermann Scholtz, a famous interpreter of Chopin, organ studies with the \\"organ king\\" Carl August Fischer, studies in theory and composition with Jean Louis Nicode). Of special significance during these nine years were his visit to Franz Liszt in Weimar (in 1884 - when his interpretation of the piano sonata op.6 received the Master's blessing of his chosen career), his increasing engagement as a concert performer (notably a memorable appearance in the Dreik√∂nig-Church in Dresden), as well as his marriage in 1889 to the Swiss Contralto Julie B√§chi (they embarked on joint concert tours in the years 1889 / 90). In 1890 Hans F√§hrmann began what would become his remaining life's work at the neo-Gothic Johannis-Church in Dresden (destroyed in 1945), where he remained active as cantor and organist until 1926. From 1892 he also worked as lecturer in virtuoso organ performance at the Royal Conservatory of Dresden (until 1939), was appointed royal music director in 1913, and professor in 1917. Hans F√§hrmann is buried in the Johannis-cemetery at Dresden-Tolkewitz. Most of the works of Hans Fahrmann were published by the Otto Junne publishing house, Leipzig. During the bombing of Leipzig (on 4 December 1943) not only did the publisher's entire family perish, but also the printing plates of the F√§hrmann compositions were completely destroyed. Besides the general upheavals throughout society after 1945 and the anti-romantic atmosphere in church music, these circumstances may also have contributed to the fact that Fahrmann's oeuvre has practically vanished. The Compositions The works of F√§hrmann consist of approximately 90 works. Besides numerous Lieder and choral compositions, several chamber works, two oratorios (\\"Heimkehr\\" and \\"Auf Bethlehems Fluren\\"), three concertos for organ and orchestra, he composed many pieces for organ solo, of which the 14 grand sonatas form the centre-piece.  From numerous contemporary reviews  The works of F√§hrmann represent as it were a n√©e plus ultra of the art of modern organ counterpoint and organ playing; at their best they rival the works of Max Reger, equal in boldness yet appearing at times superior in their fantasy. (Scientific Supplement to the Leipziger Zeitung 13.12.1902) Fahrmann renounces every concession which he might make for the sake of general success. With an energy bordering on recklessness he pursues his goals... Thus he is first and foremost one of the most modern, a Richard Strauss of the organ literature. His harmonies are of an intrepid audacity... With it hand in hand goes his ability for contrapuntal design, which can be considered as downright amazing... And to boot he adds salient and characteristic thematic invention... (Otto Schmidt in the \\"Dresdner Journal\\", quoted after H. Gruner in \\"Urania\\" 1905, No. 3) His Work as an Interpreter Hans F√§hrmann was also a performer of great importance. In the series Evenings of European Organ Music F√§hrmann introduces his audience in the years 1892-1900 to almost the entire then known organ music, and included six \\"Bach and Mendelssohn\\" evenings, six \\"Bach, Merkel, and Rheinberger\\" evenings, concerts of historic music, German-French, English, Dutch-Belgian as well as pure Liszt-programmes. In contemporary reports an average of 1,500 listeners is mentioned, not infrequently the listeners must have stood in the street. Again and again, during and at the completion of each cycle, Fahrmann engaged in dialogue with the public and published reports in technical journals about his experiences and opinions, especially regarding the presentation of Bach's organ works. His Work as a Teacher F√§hrmann's work as a teacher was enormous: 47 years as a university lecturer have left his influence on hundreds of students. The terms Father of the Saxon organists and F√§hrmann-School were current at the time; even at Helsingfors (Helsinki today) in Finland there are traces of F√§hrmann's activity and influence as a teacher. The Person Hans F√§hrmann is described by all his contemporary witnesses as a serious-minded, but nevertheless humorous, and a very hospitable person. Though he placed highdemands of punctuality and diligence upon his students (as upon himself), there was hardly a weekend without his students visiting his home for coffee and cakes. Contrary to his famous contemporary Max Reger, who had founded a brilliant interpreter and sponsor in the person of Karl Straube, the organist of St Thomas's Church in Leipzig, Hans F√§hrmann worked alone and modestly in his native Saxony. Despite much praise for F√§hrmann's valuable personal traits, it must be said that he never understood how to make use of the press for himself.

He served Deputy Secretary of Government and communications officer between the Government and the Knesset between 1948 and 1949. He narrowly missed out on being elected to the first Knesset in 1949, but entered it in 1951 after the death of Knesset and Mapai party member Avraham Tabib, and was suddenly advanced from the seventy-seventh ranking member of the Mapai party to the twenty-ninth ranking member, displacing Aryeh Sheftel.Tehuda - vol. 30, (ed.

She initiated programs that are the basis of services to children in Australian public libraries today. Contributions to children's librarianship Marjorie Cotton pioneered many of the services now associated with children's librarianship in Australia, including weekly story sessions, contact and collaboration with schools, providing material for children in languages other than English and appointing qualified children's librarians. Her influence reached far beyond the Ku-ring-gai, Newcastle, Randwick and Woollahra libraries in which she worked. She was the first president of the Library Association of Australia Children's Libraries Section in 1953. Marjorie worked with Bess Thomas conducting the first Australian course in Children‚Äôs Librarianship at Mosman Municipal Library, which was attended by librarians from four states in 1954. Raising the standard of Australian children's literature Marjorie acted as a judge on the Children‚Äôs Book Council of Australia Award panel several times. In this capacity she worked hard to raise the standard of Australian picture books. She contributed some additional chapters to Maurice Saxby's original survey of the history of Australian children's literature. Marjorie‚Äôs contribution to Australian children‚Äôs literature also includes persuading Desmond Digley to illustrate the well-loved Australian poem Waltzing Matilda by A.B. Paterson, which won the Australian Children's Book of the Year Award in 1971.

The family was made up of Classes 11 (12), 12 (12), 21 (60) and 27 (60). Classes 11, 12 and 21 were nearly twice as powerful as Classes 22, 23 and 25 while Class 27 was more than twice as powerful as the 1950s locomotives. This family was heavily influenced by the Class 20 from the mid-1970s. The 1980s locomotives were very reliable because of the trial and error development of their predecessor. This family came into service with M4 and M5 coaching stock and the AM 80 and AM 86 series of EMUs. This generation was a major modernization of the SNCB even if the older M2 coaching stock remained active for more than a decade before being replaced. These four sister classes are visually identical except for a few minor details. Class 11's bordeaux and yellow livery is specific to the Benelux service which they powered for most of their service lives. The class was designed for the fast, relatively light- weight, boat trains on the 124 km (77 mi) journey between Brussels and Ostend to be capable of speeds of 120‚Äì140 km/h (75‚Äì87 mph). They were also used on Brussels‚ÄìLi√®ge expresses. During World War II they were used on Brussels‚ÄìOstend, Lontzen/Herbesthal, and Lille trains.[4] For most of their careers, the type 12s were assigned to Schaerbeek, near Brussels. Class 21 locomotives, although lower in power than the Class 27s, work interchangeably with them for the most part. They haul both passenger and freight trains. They are frequently seen pushing or pulling trains made of M4 and M5 coaching stock around the system. The repainted locomotive in Brussels South In May 1989, locomotive 2109 was repainted in turquoise to haul a matched set of wagons for the Technorame train. This train was sponsored by the regional government of Wallonie and traveled around French-speaking Belgium displaying various high- tech items to the public for several months. At the end of this contract it re-entered regular service on both freight and passenger trains while still wearing its special colors. This continued for at least two months before it was repainted in the normal colors for the class. During 1993 locomotive 2130 was converted for use as a test bed for the development of the future Class 13. It was renumbered into Class 19 as 1901 for the testing program and was the only member of the class. It also gained triphase traction motors and a transformer that let it work under both 3000 volts DC and 25000 volts, 50 Hz AC plus French safety equipment and operated into Lille Flandres station in France a number of times while in regular service. By 2001 the testing was complete and it was restored to standard with its original number of 2130. Locomotive 2119 was involved in the severe collision at Buizingen, just north of Halle on Line 96, in 2010. Withdrawals started in early 2014 as NMBS/SNCB decided that it had a surplus of electric locomotives after the Class 18 and Class 19 were delivered from Siemens. Most Class 21 locomotives from 2101 to 2130 were withdrawn by the December 2014 timetable change. The rest will be retained until further notice. Most of 2101 to 2130 have been stripped for spares and had asbestos removed before scrapping. Classes 21 and 27 share many interchangeable parts. A major worry has been the traction motor blowers for Class 27. The company that made them in the 1980s is no longer in business so the Class 21s will serve as a spares bank to keep the Class 27s, which are more powerful, in service.

It is made up of 4 regular units and one volunteer unit. Headquartered in Colombo, formally at army headquarters. The corps Cap badge depicting the Rod of Asclepius. History The beginnings of the Corp goes back 29 July 1881 when stretcher beater company was initially raised as a part of the Ceylon Light Infantry Volunteers, this soon became the Ceylon Volunteer Medical Corps later becoming part of the Ceylon Defence Force, being deployed during world wars. Soon after the disbandment of the Ceylon Defence Force after independence, Ceylon Volunteer Medical Corps became a part of the Ceylon Army Volunteer Force with Lt. Col Sydney Jayawardene was the first Commanding Officer. But in October 1950 Ceylon Army Medical Corps in the Regular Force of the Ceylon Army was created. At its start it had 3 Officers and 20 Other Ranks were drawn from the wartime CVMC. Lt. Col H.C Serasinghe, OBE was the first Commanding Officer of the Regular Medical Corps. That year a 10 bedded camp reception station was opened at the former British Military Hospital of the Royal Army Medical Corps, shortly it was upgraded to a 30 ‚Äì bedded service hospital. The corps was renamed once again in 1972 as the Sri Lanka Army Medical Corps when Sri Lanka became a republic. The corps has served under different circumstances in its post-independence history. It had assisted civil medical services during natural disasters and takes over operations of national & provincial hospitals when its doctors and staff goes on stick. The corps has treated battle casualties and has itself received casualties when its personnel came under attack during combat operations in the 1971 Insurrection and Sri Lankan Civil War.

As a player, Street was a middle or lower order right-handed batsman and an occasional medium-pace bowler. He played regularly for the successful Surrey side in only three seasons, from 1894 to 1896, and his one innings of distinction was an unbeaten 161 against Leicestershire at Grace Road, Leicester in 1895, when his batting enabled a Surrey recovery from 94 for six wickets to reach a total of 385, which proved enough to win by an innings. He disappeared from first-class cricket after 1898. In 1909, Street joined the list of first-class umpires and remained on it for the following 25 years, retiring at the end of the 1934 season, though he reappeared for one match in 1939. He officiated in Test matches for the first time during the 1912 Triangular Tournament and stood again in matches in the 1921, 1924 and 1926 seasons. In all, he umpired in 523 first-class matches. In the 1919 season, Street was the central figure in the Heygate incident in the match between Somerset and Sussex at the County Ground, Taunton. With the scores tied, the injured Sussex batsman Harold Heygate took more than the two minutes allowed to come to the wicket, and, following a Somerset appeal, Street adjudged him to be timed out and the match result to be a tie. Street's decision was upheld by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), though the Laws of Cricket at the time did not allow for a \\"timed out\\" dismissal and Heygate was marked on the scorecard as \\"absent hurt\\". For a fuller description of this incident, which caused considerable controversy at the time, see the article on Heygate. His father, James Street, was also an umpire, who stood in one Test in 1890, as well as a player for Surrey. His uncle, George Street, was an umpire too, but was not a player at first-class level.

The Clan Ross cornered a raiding party of Clan Mackay near the village of Portmahomack and put many of them to the sword. The survivors sought sanctuary in the nearby church but the Rosses set fire to it, killing all inside. The Mackays took revenge for this outrage in the subsequent Battle of Aldy Charrish. It should not be confused with the Battle of Tarbat Ness in the 11th century, when Thorfinn the Mighty defeated \\"Karl Hundason\\", possibly a Viking name for Macbeth. Background The second half of the 15th century had seen a series of raids by the Mackays of Strathnaver on the Rosses of Balnagown. According to the Blackcastle MS (which was written by Alexander Mackay of Blackcastle who had access to the Mackay chief's family charters and papers) the Rosses had made \\"a predatory incursion\\" into the territory of the Mackays. Sir Robert Gordon however says that the Mackays \\"often molested with incursions and invasions\\" the lands of the Rosses.Mackay, Angus. (1906). The Book of Mackay. p. 68. Quoting: Gordon, Sir Robert, A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland. According to historian Angus Mackay the evidence is ample that the Mackays managed to recover some of the lands in Ross-shire that had belonged to their relatives and enemies, Neil Neilson Mackay, his brother Morgan Neilson Mackay, and Neil and Morgan's father-in-law Murray of Cubin, all three of whom had been defeated and killed by the Mackays of Strathnaver at the Battle of Drumnacoub in 1433.Mackay, Angus. (1906). The Book of Mackay. pp. 61-66 and 68. The evidence is also ample that the Rosses managed to secure some of these lands lying in the parishes of Edderton and Kincardine in Ross-shire. So it appears that the feud between the Mackays and the Rosses arose out of a scramble for disputed lands. Finally the Rosses gathered their forces to attack the invaders who were led by Angus Roy Mackay of Strathnaver, son of Neil \\"Bass\\" Mackay. The exact date of the battle is uncertain, other than it happened before the Battle of Aldy Charrish, which documentary evidence dates to either July 1487 or June 1486.See Battle of Aldy Charrish article for a discussion of its date. The date most commonly cited for events at Tarbat is 1486, but all that can be said is that it was probably some time in the 1480s.Carver (2008) describes it as an \\"incident of the 1480s\\". Battle The Rosses appear to have encountered the Mackay raiding party on the Tarbat peninsula, where they were \\"fiercely attacked\\". It appears that many Mackays were killed before they sought shelter in the Tarbat church. More were apparently killed before the church was set on fire. Angus Roy MacKay was among those killed. As a poem put it : Archaeology supports this story. Archaeologists have been investigating the Tarbat Old Church at Portmahomack for evidence of a major monastery largely destroyed around 800AD. While the target of this presumed Viking raid has attracted most attention, a new church was built on the site in the 13th century. This \\"Church 4\\" apparently suffered a major fire during the Middle Ages. Fire has scorched the sandstone of the internal walling to a bright orange, even in the crypt, and charcoal from possible roof timbers or thatch was found in the nave near the crypt entrance.Carver (2008) p.159 Aftermath John (Iain) Riabhach Mackay avenged his father's death by invading the Ross lands in 1487. This raid culminated in the Battle of Aldy Charrish at the head of the Kyle of Sutherland which saw Alexander Ross of Balnagowan and many of his kinsmen slaughtered. The Clan Ross never really recovered from this defeat.

A pathway links the village to the relatively new development of Eden in Blackrock, which is a mix of apartments, duplexes and houses along with green spaces built on the former grounds of Blackrock convent. The village square and surrounding area were subject to a ‚Ç¨2 million \\"rejuvenation\\" scheme between 2015 and 2017. Transport Blackrock Road in the early 20th century, with the tramway of the Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company Blackrock was formerly served by the narrow gauge Cork, Blackrock and Passage Railway. Blackrock railway station opened on 8 June 1850, but finally closed on 12 September 1932. the old railway line is now used by walkers as an amenity. From 1898 to 1931 it was served by the Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company. The Number 202, and Number 215 bus routes link Blackrock to the city. The Number 219 bus route links Blackrock to Bishopstown via Douglas on a southern orbital route that avoids the city centre. Sport Blackrock is home to Blackrock National Hurling Club (nicknamed The Rockies) which is located on Church Road. The Rockies are one of Ireland's most successful clubs, with 32 Senior Hurling Championship titles, 3 All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championships, 5 pre-1970 All-Ireland Titles and a number of notable inter-county hurlers over the years. Gaelic Football is played at St. Michael's GAA (nicknamed The Dazzlers) which has its playing pitches in Mahon. The Beaumont area of Blackrock is home to the under-age section of Avondale United. Blackrock is also home to Blackrock Karate club and St. Michaels Tennis Club. There is also a lawn and indoor bowls club next to the tennis club's grounds on Church Road. Blackrock has long been a centre of rowing and is home to Cork Boat Club, with the Lee Rowing Club and Shandon Rowing Club also nearby. Notable residents George Boole, inventor of Boolean algebra (the basis of modern computer arithmetic) lived in Ballintemple during his time as Professor of Mathematics at University College Cork. Boole is buried in the grounds of St. Michael's Church of Ireland on Church Road. Architect Thomas Deane built a home in the grounds of Dundanion Castle, and his architect son and grandson (Thomas Newenham Deane and Thomas Manly Deane) also lived in the area. Labour Party politician Timothy Quill also lived in Blackrock.

The ship had a short service history with the British Royal Navy before the 16-gun USS Enterprise captured her near Portland, Maine in September 1813. She then went on to have at least a decade-long commercial career. Design and construction The Bold class were a revival of Sir William Rule's design of 1804. They were armed with ten 18-pounder carronades and two 6-pounder bow chasers. Built by Hobbs & Hellyer, Redbridge, Hampshire, she was launched on 25 July 1812. Royal Navy service off Maine Commander George Rose Sartorius commissioned her in August 1812.Winfield (2008), p.346. R. Coote may have briefly commanded her before Commander Samuel Blyth took command in September; on 17 April 1813 she sailed for Halifax and service in the squadron of Sir John Borlase Warren. In Halifax, Blyth added two extra carronades to her armament. She therefore actually carried fourteen guns: twelve 18-pounder carronades and two long 6-pounders. While coming down from New Brunswick and off the coast of Lubec, Maine, Blyth sighted and captured a small sailing craft crewed by a group of women out for a sail. He brought the women aboard and politely suggested that in the future they sail closer to the shore; he then released them. One of the women was married to the local militia commander who, impressed with Blyth‚Äôs courtesy, placed advertisements in local newspapers praising his chivalry. In Boxer Lieutenant Blyth captured seven small vessels, most of them coasting: *6 July, the schooner Two Brothers, of 89 tons, from Tanfield, bound to Eastport; *6 July, the sloop Friendship, of 100 tons, from Blackrock bound to Eastport; *25 July, the sloop Fairplay; *27 July, the schooner Rebecca, of 86 tons, from New York and bound for Cadiz or Halifax; *28 July, the schooner Nancy, of 14 tons, taken in the harbour at Little River; *3 August, the schooner Rebecca, of 117 tons, from Townsend, bound to Boston; *31 August, the schooner Fortune.Dill (2006), 103. Capture by USS Enterprise Samuel Blyth, ca. 1812, from the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich On 5 September 1813, Boxer engaged the American brig Enterprise under Lieutenant William Burrows. Blyth nailed his colours to the mast and died in the first broadside.Smith (2011), p.81. The same broadside that killed Blyth dismasted Boxer. Boxer continued to fight for another half an hour before she was forced to strike. Enterprise carried two more guns, had a heavier broadside, and had almost twice the number of men. However, the key factor was the dismasting of the Boxer, which allowed Enterprise to maneuver to rake her. Furthermore, a court martial later found that a number of British seamen had deserted their quarters during the action.Lohnes (1973), p.326. Blyth was buried in Portland with full military honours at the same time and next to Burrows, who had also died in the action. The surviving officers placed a tombstone over Blyth's grave. He was 29 years old; Burrows was 28. Mercantile service Boxer was sold at auction in Portland, Maine to Thomas Merrill, Jr., for US$5,600. Her guns and ballast were sold at the same time, the whole proceeds amounting to US$9,755. Burrow's heirs received US$1,115; each seaman's share of the prize money was US$55.Goold (1886), 490. Some of her spare spars and rigging went to equip the Mercator. Boxers guns went to arm the Maine privateer Hyder Ali.Goold (1886), 467. Hyder Ali did not have much luck either. She captured two prizes that the British retook before they could reach Maine and was herself then captured in May 1814 near the Nicobar Islands by . Initially Boxer was pressed into service to defend Portland harbour. After the war she went on to sail as a merchantman for several years. Her first voyage was in April 1815. Under Captain William McLellan, Jr. (1776‚Äì1844), she sailed to Havana, New York, Cadiz, Gibraltar, Marseilles, and back to New York before returning to Portland in early 1816. Subsequent shorter cruises under McLellan, Hall, or William Merrill took her along the coast, or to the West Indies. Around 1818 Merrill sold Boxer to a Portuguese firm that used her as a mail packet between Portuguese Cape Verde and Lisbon. Merrill reported that in 1825 he passed Boxer leaving Praia at dusk as he entered the harbour on his vessel John. It is suggested that Boxer was finally lost on the coast of Brazil.Maine Historical Society (1890-1899), 176-7. Citations and references Citations References * *Dill, J.

Early life Bermingham was born in the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, and grew up with his family in The Puc, Inchicore, before moving to The Nurseries in Bluebell, where the family had a scrap yard. His father Bill and mother Mary (n√©e Dalgarno) reared a family of 3 boys and 4 girls. Willie went to school in Goldenbridge of Inchicore, and loved one of his teachers, Sister Jarlath, in particular, maintaining contact with her until his death. Career In 1964, Willie joined ;))) Dublin Fire Brigade, who also provide Dublin's Emergency Ambulance Service. He served with them until his death. Personal life In 1972 he married Mary (Marie) Kelly, a Roscommon woman whose family had moved to Chapelizod and later Lucan. They spent their 18 years of marriage living in Bluebell where they reared 2 daughters and 3 sons. Activism In 1977, Willie founded ALONE (\\"A Little Offering Never Ends\\"), an organisation highlighting the plight of older and forgotten individuals, sometimes living in squalid neglect, in Dublin. This was after he had found several people dead in appalling conditions through his work as a firefighter. He worked on a voluntary basis whilst still holding down his job in Dublin Fire Brigade. Many colleagues came on board as volunteers, and as news spread of the work, the organisation grew. Whilst it became a relatively large organisation, the focus on people as individuals never changed. The operation was run from the family home in Bluebell where the children took part as soon as their homework was completed. The office only moved from the sitting room after he died. Recognition Willie received a People of the Year award in 1979, and in 1985 he was awarded the International Firefighter of the Year award. In 1988, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Law by Trinity College, Dublin. Willie suddenly took ill in late February 1990 .

Raised in August 1941, it was disbanded not long after due to conceptual problems, but it was quickly reformed following the entry of Japan into the war in December 1941. After a period of about six months performing garrison duties in northern Australia, the 2/4th was deployed to Portuguese Timor to reinforce the other Australian units already waging a guerilla war on the island. After a brief campaign the 2/4th was returned to Australia and from there it went on to serve in New Guinea in 1943, taking part in the Salamaua-Lae campaign attached to the 9th Division. Later, the squadron was involved in one of the last campaigns of the war when it landed on Tarakan Island in May 1945 and took part in the Borneo campaign. Following the end of hostilities, the 2/4th returned to Australia and was disbanded at Ingleburn, New South Wales, on 8 January 1946. History The unit was initially formed as \\"No. 4 Independent Company\\" in August 1941, but it was disbanded in October due to conceptual problems within the Australian Army surrounding the role that the 4th and other such companies could fill in the strategic situation at that time. The Company was reformed in late December 1941 following the outbreak of the Pacific War. This time it was known as \\"2/4th Independent Company\\". After completing its training at the Guerilla Warfare School at Foster, on Wilsons Promontory, Victoria, the 2/4th was posted to the Katherine, Northern Territory, in March 1942 where it undertook garrison duties. Following the bombing of Darwin this became an operation role and during this time the 2/4th deployed a number of small groups between the McArthur and the Ord Rivers, where they were to harass any Japanese forces which might have landed there. This never eventuated, though, and in August the 2/4th moved to the town of Adelaide River, Northern Territory. In September the 2/4th Independent Company returned to Darwin and from there they were was deployed to Portuguese Timor (now East Timor) on to reinforce the 2/2nd Independent Company, which was at that time conducting a guerilla campaign on the island with the assistance of the local population. Over the course of four months, the company carried out a number of successful operations on Timor, including many successful ambushes, dynamiting of bridges and roads, as well as manning two observation posts in the mountains outside Dili where they reported the movements of Japanese ships and aircraft. This lasted until January 1943 when, due to the deteriorating situation, the decision was made to withdraw the force from the island and bring them back to Australia. Their success demonstrated what could be achieved by such a force behind enemy lines and it was used later as a model for the formation of the Australian Special Air Service after the war. The company returned to Australia and was reformed at the Jungle Warfare School at Canungra, Queensland, in April 1943 where it received reinforcements and new equipment. From there, they were moved to Wongabel on the Atherton Tablelands. It was during this time that the Australian Army began to re- organise the independent companies, as part of its larger army-wide re- organisation as it began to prepare itself for the jungle campaigns that it would fight over the next two years. As a part of this re-organisation, the independent companies were amalgamated together under a regimental headquarters that would administer the companies. These headquarters units were formed using the cavalry regiments of the 6th, 7th and 9th Divisions and as such, in October, although at that time currently overseas again, the 2/4th Independent Company was redesignated the \\"2/4th Cavalry (Commando) Squadron\\" as it became a part of the 2/7th Cavalry Commando Regiment, attached to the 7th Division. This name would later be shortened simply to \\"2/4th Commando Squadron\\" in 1944. Members of the Australian 2/4th Commando Squadron on Tarakan Island in June 1945 In August 1943, the 2/4th was deployed to New Guinea, arriving at Milne Bay where they were placed under the command of the 9th Division, attached to the 26th Brigade. On 4 September, the 2/4th participated in Australia's first amphibious landing since Gallipoli when they landed at Lae during the Salamaua-Lae campaign. The 2/4th came ashore in the second wave of the landing, suffering heavy losses with thirty-four men being killed or missing when their Landing Ship Tank was attacked by Japanese dive and torpedo bombers. After the landing, the 2/4th began reconnaissance and flank protection operations for the 26th Brigade until 30 October, when Lae finally fell and they were sent by barge to reinforce the 20th Brigade at Finschhafen in the clearing of the Huon Peninsula. During this time the 2/4th conducted numerous long range patrols, often being sent ahead of the main advance, before finally being removed from the line at the end of February 1944 and being sent back to Australia for leave. Upon its return to Australia, the 2/4th regrouped at Ravenshoe, Queensland, where in March 1944 it became part of the 2/9th Cavalry Commando Regiment and was officially attached to the 9th Division with whom it had served during the recently concluded operations in New Guinea. The squadron then experienced a hiatus from operations for over a year, during which time it conducted numerous training exercises in northern Queensland, before embarking from Townsville and sailing to Morotai in April 1945. From here the squadron took part in the landings at Tarakan Island off Borneo as part of the \\"Oboe\\" operations. Throughout May and June the 2/4th played an important role in the campaign. The landing on Sadau Island was unopposed and a few days later on 3 May at Tarakan it was once again tasked to act in support of the 26th Brigade. In the coming days and weeks the 2/4th saw extensive service during the liberation of Tarakan, suffering heavy casualties with four officers and fifty-two other ranks being killed or wounded in this time. This was the squadron's last operation and following its return to Australia it was disbanded at Ingleburn, New South Wales, on 8 January 1946. During its service the 2/4th lost 68 men killed in action or died on active service. Five members were awarded the Military Medal, while 15 were Mentioned in Despatches.

They are manufactured from sugar and glucose syrup, corn starch and/or various other starches, animal gelatin, and various colourings and flavouring. Midget Gems were extremely popular in the North of England and were one of The Lion Confectionery Company's biggest selling brands. In 1995 the company joined forces with Cadbury Trebor Bassett brand Maynard's to market the sweet across the country. 150px At the time the sweet was re- branded under the Maynard's banner, the black Midget Gems were changed from liquorice flavour to blackcurrant, but only in the bagged product - those sold loose, from jars and boxes, remain liquorice. A leading selling point for Midget Gems is that they were often sold loose from a jar or barrel. This made them inexpensive and helped bolster their popularity. Midget Gems are produced by a wide variety of other companies. Glisten Confectionery manufacture them under their Victoria brand, and in 2007 announced that they were removing all artificial colours and flavourings from the sweets. Many supermarkets and stores such as Asda, Tesco, Marks and Spencers, and Sainsbury's manufacture their own versions.

Unusually, the trophy was shared by three of the Home Nations all of whom scored four points. At the time, goal difference was not used to differentiate teams. In addition to the usual favourites of England and Scotland, Ireland also took their first ever share of the championship, after scoring their first ever victory over the Scots with a 2‚Äì0 win in Glasgow and subsequently beating Wales. The tournament was played under the shadow of the previous year's finale, when a wooden stand at Ibrox Stadium had given way under the mass of supporters and 26 people had fallen to their deaths. Ireland and England began the competition with the English scoring four without reply to take an early lead. England extended their advantage in the second match with a 2‚Äì1 victory over Wales and seemed to be on course for the championship. Scotland began their challenge against Wales in a match they narrowly won before stumbling against Ireland in a match the Irish dominated in front of the Scottish home support. Just two years previously at the same stadium, Scotland had beaten Ireland 11‚Äì0 in what is still their record win. On the back of this result, Ireland beat Wales 2‚Äì0 ending a miserable tournament for the Welsh who had scored only one goal and failed to gain a single point. In the final match between England and Scotland, Scotland needed a win to draw level with Ireland and England whilst England needed only a draw to take to competition undisputed. In a tough match in Sheffield both sides played well, but Scotland eventually won 2‚Äì1 taking their share of the trophy.

In 1916 he was captured by an Austrian submarine and held as a prisoner for the next two years. He died in 1920 in unusual circumstances after becoming lost in the South African bush near Port Elizabeth and succumbing to the elements. Military career Hurdis Ravenshaw was born in June 1869 to John Hurdis Ravenshaw and his second wife Harriet Lalande Biggs. His elder half-brother was Thomas Edward Ravenshaw., thePeerage.com. Retrieved 19 August 2007 He was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College and from there joined the militia, using this posting to gain a commission in the East Yorkshire Regiment in December 1888. Seeking action, in August 1890 he transferred to the Devonshire Regiment who were sent to India and went on campaign in 1895 as part of the Chitral Relief Force which overthrew the Mehtar of Chitral and replaced him with the pro-British Shuja ul-Mulk the younger son of the former ruler, Aman ul-Mulk. In 1897 and 1898 Ravenshaw was again active, conducting operations against Malakand and then participating in the Tirah Campaign where he was with the army which forced the Khyber Pass against the Afridis. In 1899 he was transferred with his regiment to South Africa to fight against the Boers at the outbreak of the Second Boer War. As Adjutant of the regiment, Ravenshaw fought in the relief of Ladysmith and numerous smaller actions for three years. On his return home, Ravenshaw was given the position of Adjutant at Sandhurst, a post he held until 1907. First World War In 1914, Ravenshaw was brought out of semi- retirement to command the 1st battalion of the Connaught Rangers, an Irish regiment in India which he brought to France for service on the Western Front in late September. Ravenshaw remained in command of the Connaught Rangers until April 1915, when he was made a staff officer at 1st Division headquarters before being promoted and given command of the 83rd Brigade.

During his playing career Bradman made a rapid rise from playing cricket for his hometown of Bowral in the southern highlands of New South Wales. Aged 19, he made a first-class debut for the NSW team in 1927‚Äì28 and first earned selection for the Australian Test side during the Ashes series of 1928‚Äì29. A score of 112 in the second innings of the third Test at Melbourne made him the youngest player to score a Test century.Record later broken. However, it was his performances during the 1930 Ashes series that first set him apart from his contemporaries. He broke myriad records (many of which still stand) in scoring 974 runs at an average of 139. Aloofness from teammates Bradman had a quiet, solitary off-field demeanour that first drew comment during his performances on the 1930 tour of England. Melbourne journalist Geoffrey Tebbutt, described Bradman's aloofness from his teammatesEason (2004), p 314. in his subsequent book about the tour.With the 1930 Australians, published by Hodder and Stoughton in 1930. He described Bradman's usual routine after play ‚Äì Bradman would retire to his hotel room, write and listen to a phonograph. After scoring a world record of 334 runs in the Test match at Leeds, Bradman was given a cheque for ¬£1000 by an admiring expatriate Australian businessman. Tebbutt wrote that Bradman had not even offered to buy his teammates a round of drinks, let alone share the money. His exploits in England made him a national hero in Australia, and he received an overwhelming reception when he returned home. Bradman left his teammates on board their ship at Fremantle to attend welcoming functions in Adelaide, Melbourne, Goulburn, his hometown Bowral and Sydney, all organised by his employers. In Sydney, he received a brand new custom-built Chevrolet. The receptions and the level of adulation from the media and the public \\"embarrassed\\" him.Williams (1996), p 67. Naturally, this type of focus on an individual in a team game had ramifications. Adding to the criticism offered by Tebbutt, the Australian vice-captain Vic Richardson commented that, \\"we could have played any team without Bradman, but we could not have played the blind school without [leg spin bowler] Clarrie Grimmett\\".Harte (1993), p 327. Disputes with administrators Bradman spent much of his solitary time on the tour writing as he had sold the rights to a book. Serialised in London's The Star during August, Don Bradman's Book was published in November 1930. It was a modest work of 50,000 words with a few pages of tips as an appendix.Page (1983), p 110. The Board of Control ruled that the serialised extracts of his book were a technical breach of his tour contract, which banned players from writing about the game.Harte (1993), p 328. The dispute was widely covered by the press, most of which was supportive of Bradman. However, he was fined ¬£50 for the misdemeanour on 29 December 1930.Page (1993), p 119. Proposal to play professional cricket In the spring of 1931, Bradman seriously contemplated playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington.Bradman (1950), pp 44‚Äì46. The media in England and Australia hotly debated the consequences of a move that would end Bradman's Test career.Page (1983), pp 129‚Äì141. Bradman was advised by the Board of Control that if he played cricket in England in 1932, it would be another breach of his 1930 tour contract and therefore he would not be considered for Test selection if he went ahead with the deal. Public opinion divided: Australian cricket could not afford to lose him and some thought he was selling his birthright, but at the height of the Depression, working-class people empathised with Bradman. The opportunity to earn over ¬£1000 per annum was very tempting to a young man without a profession.Williams (1996), p 77. Eventually, a consortium of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative. They devised a two-year contract whereby Bradman would write for Associated Newspapers, broadcast regularly on Radio 2UE and promote the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son.Page (1983), p 140‚Äì141. The contract was substantially less than the money on offer from Accrington, and it would increase Bradman's dependence on his public profile,Williams (1996), p 78. thus making it more difficult to lead the private life that he desired. In addition, writing for the newspapers would again bring him into conflict with the administrators. The Australian Board of Control refused permission for him to write about the 1932‚Äì33 series for the press, claiming that only \\"professional\\" journalists (such as Jack Fingleton) were entitled to do so under the Board's rules. This led to open confrontation: Bradman was adamant that he would honour his writing contract. If necessary, he would write and not play. The impasse resolved when the editorial chief of Associated Newspapers, RC Packer (grandfather of Kerry Packer) agreed to release him from the obligation. Bodyline Bradman's prolific run-making tested the minds of his opposition. The conundrum bedevilled English minds during preparations for their next tour of Australia. London's News Chronicle summed up the prevailing sentiment: :As long as Australia has Bradman she will be invincible...To keep alive the competitive spirit, the authorities might take a hint from billiards. It is almost time to request a legal limit on the number of runs Bradman should be allowed to make.Harte (1993), p 327. The rules of English billiards were changed due to the prodigious breaks of Australian Walter Lindrum whose biography can be accessed here Ex-England player Percy Fender wrote, \\"something new will have to be introduced to curb Bradman...[something] along the lines of theory\\".Frith (2002), p 40. Fender's successor as captain of Surrey was the amateur batsman Douglas Jardine, who had shared Fender's tribulations in finding a way to subdue Bradman. \\"Plum\\" Warner was an influential voice within the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the club that administered English cricket at the time.Frith (2002), pp 40‚Äì41. Warner opined that, \\"England must evolve a new type of bowler and develop fresh ideas and strange tactics to curb his almost uncanny skill\\".Frith (2002), p 41. Warner orchestrated the appointment of Jardine as England captain in 1931, with a view to him leading the tour to Australia. Warner accompanied the team as manager. Encouraged by the perception that Bradman struggled against bouncers on a lively pitch during his 232 at The Oval, Jardine began gathering information from players such as Frank Foster who employed \\"leg theory\\" in English cricket. Jardine's innovation was to combine traditional leg theory with short-pitched bowling that bounced more alarmingly on harder Australian pitches. He settled on the Notts fast bowlers Harold Larwood and Bill Voce as the spearheads for his tactics during a meeting with the duo's county captain, Arthur Carr. In support, the England selectors chose another three pacemen for the squad. The unusually high number of fast bowlers caused a lot of comment in both countries and Bradman himself suspected a virulent intent.Bradman (1950) p 60 Bradman had several problems to deal with at this time, he was suffering random bouts of illness from an undiagnosed malaise,Bradman (1950), p 60. while the dispute over his newspaper contract was being resolved. He faced the English in three first-class games before the Tests, and in six innings averaged just 17.16. Jardine decided to trial their new tactics in only one game, a fixture against an Australian XI at Melbourne. In this match, Bradman faced the leg theory and looked uncomfortable in losing his wicket twice to Larwood. Later, Bradman sought out some local administrators and warned of trouble brewing if the leg theory continued. Ill- health forced Bradman to withdraw from the first Test at Sydney, and a rumour circulated that he had suffered a nervous breakdown. In his absence, England persisted with bowling Bodyline (as it was now dubbed) and won an ill-tempered match despite a heroic century from Stan McCabe. Included as a replacement for Alan Kippax, Bradman walked to the crease on the first day of the second Test at the MCG with the score at 2/67. A world record crowd of 63,993 provided a standing ovation that delayed play for several minutes.Williams (1996), pp 97‚Äì98. Anticipating the bouncer first ball, Bradman moved across to play the hook shot, but the ball failed to rise and he dragged it onto his stumps, making his initial first-ball duck in a Test. The crowd fell into stunned silence as he walked off. Australia took a first-innings lead in the match, and another record crowd on turned out on 2 January 1933 to watch Bradman hit a counter-attacking second innings century. His unbeaten 103 (from 146 balls) in a team total of 191 helped set England a target of 251 to win. Bill O'Reilly and Bert Ironmonger bowled Australia to a series-levelling victory amid hopes that Bodyline was beaten. The third Test at Adelaide Oval proved pivotal. Angry crowd scenes occurred after the Australian skipper Bill Woodfull and wicketkeeper Bert Oldfield were hit by bouncers. An apologetic Plum Warner entered the Australian dressing room and was rebuked by Woodfull. The Board of Control, in a cable to the MCC, repeated the allegation of poor sportsmanship directed at Warner by Woodfull. Furious that a private conversation in the dressing room made the newspapers, Warner blamed Jack Fingleton for what he considered to be a breach of ethics. In turn, Fingleton believed Bradman responsible, a claim Bradman always denied. This incident led to a major falling-out between the two. Fingleton was dropped after scoring a pair in the match and subsequently omitted from the 1934 tour of England. He blamed Bradman for these setbacks. Bradman during his playing days. England continued with Bodyline despite Australian protests, and with the support of the MCC. The tourists won the last three Tests convincingly and regained the Ashes. Bradman caused controversy with his own tactics. Always seeking to score, he often backed away and hit the ball into the vacant half of the outfield with unorthodox shots reminiscent of tennis or golf.Williams (1996), p 99. This brought him 396 runs (at 56.57) for the series and plaudits for seeking an answer to playing Bodyline. However, others thought it proved the theory that he did not handle the short ball very well. Jack Fingleton was in no doubt that Bradman's game altered irrevocably as a consequence, writing: :Bodyline was specially prepared, nutured for and expended on him and, in consequence, his technique underwent a change quicker than might have been the case with the passage of time. Bodyline plucked something vibrant from his art.Fingleton (1949), p 198. Captaincy problems There was off-field intrigue in Australian cricket during 1935. Australia, scheduled to make its first full tour of South Africa the following summer,Australia had toured South Africa and played three Tests in 1902 and 1921. On both occasions the visits were made on the way home from a tour of England. The 1935‚Äì36 series constituted five Tests. needed to replace the retired Bill Woodfull as captain. The Board of Control wanted Bradman to lead the team.Bradman (1950), p 94. However, on 8 August 1935, the Board announced that Bradman was unfit and that he was withdrawing from the squad;Harte (1993), p 360. yet he led the South Australia team in a full programme of matches in the absence of the Australian players.Bradman (1950), pp 94‚Äì97. Vic Richardson, who Bradman replaced as SA captain, was made Test captain, even though his form did not warrant a place in the Australian team.Richardson had not played for Australia since the 1932‚Äì33 Ashes series, at which point his record in 14 Tests was 622 runs at 24.88. Against South Africa, he made 84 runs in five innings. . Chris Harte has thoroughly researched the files of the SACA, and written histories of both the SACASACA: The History of the South Australian Cricket Association, published by Sports Marketing in 1990. and Australian cricket. His analysis of the situation is that an (unspecified) prior commercial agreement forced Bradman to remain in Australia. Moreover, Harte attributes an ulterior motive to the SACA's recruitment of Bradman. The issue of the off-field behaviour of Vic Richardson, and some other regular SA players, had festered over a number of years and the SACA was desperate for a solution.Harte (1993), p 352. Therefore, they wanted Bradman to provide new leadership and improve discipline, as well as score runs. Bradman became a committeeman of the SACA, and a selector of the SA and Australian teams. He took his adopted state to the Sheffield Shield for the first time in ten years and set a string of SA records along the way.Harte (1993), p 367. In South Africa, the Australia team had a very successful tourHarte (1993), pp 360‚Äì2. and senior players such as Bill O'Reilly were pointed in their comments about the enjoyment of playing under Richardson's captaincy.O'Reilly (1985), pp 144‚Äì145. A clique of players who were openly hostile toward Bradman formed during the tour.Williams (1996), p 148. For some, the prospect of playing under Bradman was daunting, as was the knowledge that he would be sitting in judgment of their abilities in his role as a selector. To start the new season, the Test side played a rest of Australia team captained by Bradman at Sydney in early October 1936. The Test XI suffered a big defeat, due to Bradman's 212 and a bag of twelve wickets by leg-spinner Frank Ward.Harte (1993), p 369. Rather undiplomatically, Bradman let the members of the Test team know that despite their recent success, they were not quite as good as they believed themselves to be.Williams (1996) p 148 During his administrative career Bradman's administrative career was much longer than his playing career, and proved just as influential. In addition to acting as South Australia's delegate to the Board of Control from 1945 to 1980, he was a committeeman of the SA Cricket Association (SACA) between 1935 and 1986.Eason (2004),pp 14‚Äì16. It is estimated that Bradman attended 1713 SACA meetings during this half century of service.Harte (1993), p 658. He was also a selector for the Test team between 1936 and 1971.Eason (2004), pp 273‚Äì274. Apart from two years in the early 1950s when he stood down due to his son's illness. He had two periods as chairman of the Board of Control, between 1960‚Äì63 and 1969‚Äì72.Harte (1993), p 476. Throwing In the early 1960s, Bradman dealt with the growing prevalence of illegal bowling actions in the game, liaising with the English authorities to help solve a problem that Bradman called \\"the most complex I have known in cricket, because it is not a matter of fact but of opinion.\\"Eason (2004), p 15. Bradman was accused of using Australian paceman Ian Meckiff as a \\"sacrificial goat\\", by selecting him to play Tests when it was believed that he privately felt that Meckiff had an illegal action, so that Meckiff would be no-balled, so that it would show that Australia was serious about stamping out throwing. Meckiff was duly called by Colin Egar in December 1964, ending his career. Many cricket writers assailed Bradman and the other selectors for sending Meckiff out to be \\"executed\\".Whimpress, p. 87. Bradman had hosted a dinner in January 1963 for four visiting state captains at his Adelaide home.Whimpress, p. 90.Haigh, p. 182. There Bradman showed frame-by-frame film of Meckiff and other suspect Australian bowlers, which purported to show incriminating evidence against their bowling actions.Whimpress, p. 91. South African tour 1971‚Äì72 The major controversy of the second stint was a proposed tour of Australia by South Africa in 1971‚Äì72. On Bradman's recommendation, the series was cancelled.Page (1983), pp 350‚Äì355.  World Series Cricket  Bradman played an important role during the World Series Cricket (WSC) schism of the late 1970s. He was no fan of the concept but he dealt with WSC in a more pragmatic manner than other members of the ACB.Harte (1993), p 587. Bradman realised the weaknesses inherent in Australian cricket and favoured compromise very early in the dispute. In 1977, Richie Benaud, hired as a consultant and commentator for WSC, prepared a document for WSC on the inner workings of official cricket, and described Bradman as \\"a brilliant administrator and businessman\\" and warned that he was not to be underestimated.Haigh (1993), p 106. During the first season of peace between the two organisations (1979‚Äì80), Bradman felt that Packer's men, now effectively running the game, were easing him out. Former WSC Australian captain Ian Chappell was playing his last season. After serving a three-week suspension for misbehaviour, Chappell was again reported by an umpire for poor on-field conduct in his first match back. Bradman was asked to head a three-man disciplinary hearing for Chappell, who arrived at the proceedings drinking a beer.Great Australian feuds Chris Harte quotes Bradman on what transpired: > It was a set-up. The two other Board members cried off with feeble excuses > and I had to sit alone in judgment. I heard the case; found Chappell guilty > as charged, and suspended him forthwith for a period of six weeks. I sent my > report to the Board who did not back me up. Chappell's sentence was > suspended. I had no other course of action than to see the season through > and not re-nominate again.Harte (1993), p 614. Chappell was always clear about his thoughts on the matter. Bradman's obstinacy, he believed, was responsible for much of the ill-will that brought about the Packer breakaway: \\"Once you'd put your case he countered with the perennial, 'No son, we can't do that,' delivered in his distinctive high- pitched tone, as was the harangue that followed and then the meeting was over.\\"\\"Cricket's Superman had human frailties.\\" Cricinfo. 27 October 2008. (accessed 26 October 2008). Shortly after the hearing, Chappell was recalled to the Australian team for the first time in four years. In recent times, he has commented that Bradman should have held more empathy with the players' quest for better pay, bearing in mind that Bradman had fought with the Board in the early 1930s over similar issues. While Chappell has suggested that Bradman was parsimonious and treated the ACB's money as his own, Gideon Haigh considers that Bradman was merely applying the standards of his own generation without taking into account that society (and sports) has changed: > Bradman's playing philosophy ‚Äì that cricket should not be a career, and that > those good enough could profit from other avenues ‚Äì also seems to have borne > on his approach to administration. Biographers have disserved Bradman in > glossing over his years in officialdom.

Historical background First edition cover page, 1869 The magazine is seen as the direct descendant of the Vienac literary magazine, which gathered the best Croatian writers and poets of the second half of the 19th century. It was created in 1869 to \\"delight and educate\\" (zabavi i pouci). Prominent cultural figures were editors-in-chief. In the first year, the magazine was managed by ƒêuro De≈æeliƒá, then by Ivan Perkovac, Milivoj De≈æman, Franjo Markoviƒá and Vjekoslav Klaiƒá. Vienac soon became the main Croatian literary magazine of the second half of the 19th century, especially when it was managed by the greatest Croatian writer of the time, August ≈†enoa, from 1874 until his death in 1881. It is a showcase of the big literary names of the period. For example, Ksaver ≈†andor Gjalski published his first short story there in 1884. Vijenac also published translations of works by Zola, Daudet and Turgenev. From 1890 to 1896, it was edited by Josip Pasariƒá, a major critic of Croatian realism. Both the content and the illustrations were on the level of the contemporary European literary magazines. Vienac was the only edition of Matica ilirska (the Illyrian Matrix) until Matica was restructured in 1874 to become the Matica hrvatska. After that, Vienac was published by a printing company. It died out in 1903. Vijenac today After its revival in 1993, Vijenac soon regained its prestige status as a prominent literary and arts publication. However, in late 1998 a group of top contributors (including the then editor-in-chief, Andrea Zlatar) left Vijenac and established Zarez.

It has a spreading habit, smooth bark, elliptical to egg-shaped or oblong leaves, flower buds in groups of three, yellow flowers and cup-shaped, conical or bell-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus preissiana is a mallee that typically grows to a height of with a sprawling habit, and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, greyish and brown bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are square in cross-section and elliptical to egg-shaped leaves that are the greyish green, long, wide and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are sometimes arranged alternately, the same shade of dull greyish green on both sides, elliptical to egg-shaped or oblong, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils on a flattened, unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from September to November and the flowers are yellow. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped, conical or bell-shaped capsule long and wide with lobes between the valves. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus preissiana was first formally described in 1844 by the Johannes Conrad Schauer and the description was published in Lehmann's book Plantae Preissianae. The specific epithet honours Ludwig Preiss who collected the type specimen near Cape Riche in 1840. In 1995 Ian Brooker and Andrew Slee described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus preissiana subsp. lobata Brooker & Slee differs from subspecies preissiana in having large lobes between the valves of the fruit; * Eucalyptus preissiana Schauer subsp. preissiana has fruit that lack lobes or have small lobes below the rim of the fruit. Distribution Bell- fruited mallee is found in coastal and sub-coastal areas among limestone and laterite and grows in gravelly sandy-clay soils. It occurs in coastal and near-coastal areas from the Stirling Range to the Fitzgerald River National Park and almost to Esperance to the east. Subspecies lobata only occurs in coastal areas in a few places between Esperance and Hopetoun. Conservation status Subspecies preissiana is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, but subspecies lobata is classified as \\"Priority Four\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that is rare or near threatened. Use in horticulture Bell-fruited mallee can be cultivated in temperate areas of Australia but performs poorly in tropical environments. It is propagated from seeds and germinates easily. It prefers a position in full sun and in well-drained soils.

It is known by the English common names flaming Katy, Christmas kalanchoe, florist kalanchoe and Madagascar widow's-thrill. Taxonomy and naming Kalanchoe blossfeldiana is in the Kalanchoe section of the Kalanchoe genus, with a description of the plant published in 1934 (Repert. Spec. Nov. Regni Veg. 35:159). Regarding the etymology of the binomial, Adanson adapted the generic name Kalanchoe from 'Kalanchauhuy', a Chinese name for one species recorded by Georg Joseph Kamel, a botanist and Jesuit missionary to the Philippines.Adanson, M. Familles des PlantesCamel, J.G. Herbarium aliarumque stirpium in Insul√¢ Luzone Philippinarum Primari√¢ nascentium. In: John Ray: Historia plantarum. Band 3, London 1704, Anhang, S. 1‚Äì42 p. 6. item 18. The Oxford English Dictionary states that it is \\"based on [the] Chinese ‰ºΩËóçËèú gƒÅl√°nc√†i\\", whilst the Collins English Dictionary merely restates the claim that the generic name was derived from the local Chinese name for one of the species. The specific epithet blossfeldiana is in tribute to German hybridiser and botanist Robert Blossfeld, who first introduced the plant to the rest of the world in 1932. The common name Christmas Kalanchoe comes from the plant's flamboyant and colourful blooms in winter. Description Potted Kalanchoe blossfeldiana Kalanchoe blossfeldiana is a glabrous, bushy, evergreen and perennial succulent plant which (in 2‚Äì5 years) can reach an ultimate height of between 30‚Äì45 cm (12-18 in.) and an ultimate spread of between 10‚Äì50 cm (4-20 in.). K. blossfeldiana has a round habit and a moderate plant density; its growth rate has been described as 'slow'. The plant has green, shiny and textured glossy foliage which stays green all year round. The scallop-edged and ovate leaves are arranged in an opposite/subopposite fashion, are simple in type with crenate margins and an oblong shape. The arrangement of the veins in a leaf (venation) can be absent or very hard to see; the leaf blades are 5‚Äì10 cm (2-4 in.) long. K. blossfeldiana flowers in late autumn to early winter; each flower has four petals and can be one of a wide variety of colours, from the dark reds and pinks to oranges, golds and whites. The ovary is tetracarpellary and apocarpous while stamens are four in number and are epipetalous. The inflorescences are born by peduncles which are higher up than the leaves and are terminal in nature. Parts of Kalanchoe blossfeldiana are poisonous if ingested. Distribution and habitat Kalanchoe blossfeldiana is native to Madagascar, where the plant can be found growing in the relatively cool plateaus of the Tsarantanana Mountains; K. blossfeldiana in this environment grows in humus soil. Ecology While generally disease-free, Kalanchoe blossfeldiana can be damaged by pest insects such as Otiorhynchus sulcatus (vine weevil) or mealybugs. Cultivation With a minimum temperature of K. blossfeldiana requires the protection of glass during the winter months in temperate locations. It needs to be in a cool, partially shaded spot. However it may be placed outside in summer. In the UK It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit.

His legacy as an academic provided insights in mathematics and in the development of modern meteorology. As a military officer, he was at the forefront of the early French military and civil aviation with the development of military kites and a new discipline: the kite aerial photography.Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de photographie Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de photographie ‚Äì 1908 \\"Saconney (Jacques-Th√©odore), capitaine du G√©nie, Section technique du G√©nie, 39, rue Bellechasse, Paris, 7' (1908). \\" Family background Having its roots in Saconnex, Switzerland (which is located in the suburbs of Geneva Saconnex-d'Arve, Le Grand-Saconnex, or Le Petit-Saconnex), the Saconney family (written at the time Saconex, Saconay, Saconney) escaped the Protestant Revolution by immigrating to France during the XVIth century. His forefathers first settled in Lyon, where a few members of his family left some traces including Henri de Saconay and Gabriel de Saconay.Henri de Saconay (1396‚Äì1445) was sent to the Council of Constance in 1414 and Gabriel de Saconay denounced the Protestant Reformation. See the PhD history thesis of Charles-Henri Eyraud, \\"Horloges astronomiques au tournant du XVIIIe si√®cle : de l'√†-peu-pr√®s √† la precision\\", including the biography and the description of the tombs en Henri de Saconay and Gabriel de Saconay in the cathedral of Lyon. Available at For Henri de Saconay, see page 156 and 214; and Gabriel de Saconay, page 218. Jean Calvin wrote a response to Gabriel de Saconay's attack: ‚ÄúCongratulations to the Venerable Presbyter, Lord Gabriel of Saconay, Precentor of the Church at Lyon for the Beautiful and Elegant Preface that He Wrote for the Book of the King of England\\" available at The Saconay then settled in Burgundy where they cultivated wine in Gevrey-Chambertin.one of his direct ancestors was called Hugues Saconney and bore the title of \\"Gentilhomme poussant charette\\" but the following generation were not confirmed in their nobility The tombs of the family still remain in this village. During the 19th century, Jacques Theodore's grandfather became prosperous in the hotel industry. He followed the construction of the train between Dijon and Turin, and he ended up earning many estates in Turin, Italy, in Dijon and Aix-les-Bains, France. The coat of arms of the Saconney's: A soldier and a scientist Saconney kite 1910. Jacques Theodore Saconney was educated at the prestigious High School Henry IV in Paris, France, and was admitted at \\"l'√âcole Polytechnique\\", Paris, in 1895. In 1897, Saconney was appointed an officer in the French Army and he was assigned to the 4th regiment \\"du G√©nie\\" in Grenoble where he became a military balloonist. At first, one of his main interests lied in military observation and in kites. In 1902, Captain Saconney was successful in creating a kite system which was capable of carrying a camera that allowed the establishment of a precise mapping. In 1909, Th√©ophile Bois and Jacques-Th√©odore Saconney published a scientific paper explaining the technical reasons why kites remained stable when flying in the air and providing scientific evidence explaining the equilibrium of such flying instruments.http://www.ac- nice.fr/ia06/pedagogie/sciences/Olivier/site%20onmpa/les%20exploitations%20p%E9da/th%E9orievolducerf- volant.htm Also in 1909, a competition to determine the most suitable man lifting technique existent at that time was launched. The prize was won by Captain Madiot but he died shortly afterward in a flying accident. As Captain Madiot‚Äôs system was not fully developed, Captain Saconney‚Äôs man lifting system was adopted by the French nascent Army Air force. Saconney‚Äôs man lifting system contained a motorcar, trailer, and a winch that was driven by the car's engine. The system was also installed aboard the ship The Edgar Quinet in 1911. In November 1912, Saconney became head of the laboratory of meteorology and aerial photography of Chalais-Meudon. During World War I, he was in charge of the observation of the enemy. At first, he integrated a Balloonist Company, and in August 1914, Captain Saconney took the command of the Automobile section of the balloon and kite military section which was based in Epinal, Vosges. Pioneer of French civil aviation After World War I, Commandant Saconney became president of the Commission for the Application of Meteorology to Aerial Navigation, which later became the International Commission for Aeronautical Meteorology. This Commission provided guidance and coordination to the International Aeronautical Meteorology. This commission was part of the International Meteorological Organization (IMO), the predecessor of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which was established in 1919. At that time, he was reckoned to be the authority in his field. Then he was in charge of organising French civil aviation. Between 1919 and 1922, Colonel Saconney was the director of the civil aviation.http://www.planete- tp.com/article.php3?id_article=11 In a report from the National Advisory Committee for aeronautics, entitled ‚Äúcommercial aviation in France‚Äù (1922), it was said that the first step of the creation of the commercial aviation in France was realised by Colonel Saconney. The report states that between 1919 and 1922, the French commercial aviation acquired its first experience and its supremacy by setting permanent air routes between Paris‚ÄìLondon, Paris‚ÄìBrussels, Paris‚ÄìStrasbourg‚ÄìPrague‚ÄìWarsaw, Paris‚ÄìGeneva, Bordeaux‚ÄìToulouse‚ÄìMontpellier, Nimes‚ÄìMarseilles, Toulouse‚ÄìCasablanca and Bayonne‚ÄìBilbao. According to General Nudant, Saconney was the architect of the French military and civil aviation.G√©n√©ral Nudant, \\"Les routes a√©riennes \\", L'Ouest-√âclair, 25 Aout 1927, Le R√©publicain quotidien, \\" L'artisan du r√©seau a√©rien fran√ßais fut le g√©n√©ral Saconney qui le con√ßut comme l'amorce, en tous les sens, des grands parcours internationaux avec cette pens√©e que chaque \\" nation √©quiperait le tron√ßon empruntant l'atmosph√®re au-dessus de son territoire. \\". Further, he launched the creation of different airports including the A√©roport de Marseille on the √âtang de Berre.Louis Fran√ßois, L'a√©roport de Marseille‚ÄìMarignane, \\" Les √âtudes rhodaniennes \\", 1929, vol.

Saconney inaugurated in 1926, with the Mayor of Dijon, the first air-lighthouse, specially designed for air navigation, sited on the Mont Afrique. Saconney died in Dijon on 14 July 1935 leaving behind him two sons and one daughter. Legacy The last exhibition of Saconney's kite was held recently in Soissons, France. The grandson of General Saconney attended the event. An Article in French on the life of General Saconney was written by Andr√© Mignard in the review \\" Lucane \\" in 1980..

New York Magazine, November 23, 1970, p. 17 The Cleveland Play House in 1972, and Iglesia's Theater Club (New York) in 1975. Synopsis Johnny, a teen-aged young man, tries to come to terms with himself and his family. He wants to leave school to be a poet, to the dismay of his schoolteacher mother. The play takes place in February 1965, in a small Long Island, New York town. The characters consist of 16-year-old Johnny Edwards; Florence Edwards, his mother; Alexander Edwards, her estranged husband; Harry Armstrong, Johnny's uncle; and Bettina, a \\"very grown-up\\" 15-year-old neighbor.Johnny No-Trump, a play in two acts by Mary Mercier, copyright 1966, Dramatists Play Service Reception In his review in The New York Times, critic Clive Barnes wrote: \\"There are times when the characters...seem to be talking with absolute truthfulness...within seconds the play... is offering slick gibberish.\\"Barnes, Clive. \\"Theater: Misfit at Odds With World: 'Johnny No-Trump' in Premiere at Cort\\", The New York Times, October 9, 1967, p. 60 Barnes wrote after it closed \\"...I regret [it] was abruptly taken off by its producer before it had a chance to get a word-of-mouth resuscitation.\\"Barnes, Clive. \\"Theater: So Far So Good: This Season, in Yielding Three First-Rate Plays, Has Already Outshone the Last\\", New York Times, October 20, 1967, p. 53 Walter Kerr, also in The New York Times, wrote that Mercier \\"is plainly talented, she is already capable of a blunt and crackling speech that insists upon being listened to. ...

It is used to connect traces on a printed circuit board. This format allows it to be placed on the circuit board using the same automated equipment used to place other resistors, instead of requiring a separate machine to install a jumper or other wire. Zero-ohm resistors may be packaged like cylindrical resistors, or like surface-mount resistors. One use is to allow traces on the same side of a PCB to cross: one trace has a zero-ohm resistor while the second trace runs in between the leads of the resistor, avoiding contact with the first trace. The resistance is only approximately zero; only a maximum (typically 10‚Äì50 mŒ©) is specified. A percentage tolerance would not make sense, as it would be specified as a percentage of the ideal value of zero ohms (which would always be zero), so it is not specified. An axial-lead through-hole zero-ohm resistor is generally marked with a single black band, the symbol for \\"0\\" in the resistor color code. Surface-mount resistors are generally marked with a single \\"0\\" or \\"000\\". Design considerations In practice, zero-ohm resistors can be useful as configuration jumpers, but caution is exercised for PCB designs which may use zero-ohm resistors to select between options which require larger trace currents in the design. For these situations, it is better design practice to specify a low-ohm resistance, such as a 0.001-ohm to 0.003-ohm resistor, rather than the generic \\"zero-ohm\\" resistor in which the actual resistance may be higher, and tolerance is not given. The low-ohm resistors are easily obtained with 5% or 1% tolerances on a maximum specified resistance and can be safely utilized to pass much higher currents. For example, a surface-mounted 0805 size resistor of 0.003 ohms, rated at 1/2 watt can, in theory, safely pass up to 12.9 amperes of current. In practice, when approaching the power limit for a given package, it is good practice to either use an even lower-ohm product (more power-efficient but more expensive) or go up one package size larger (same power efficiency but cost may be kept lower). The \\"cost\\" associated with taking up more board space for the larger package may also be a consideration. In this example, for 12 amperes to pass through the jumper, a lower resistance or a bigger surface-mount package (such as a 1206) are usually specified. In contrast, a \\"worst-case zero-ohm\\" real-world jumper with 0.05-ohm impedance in a similar 0805 package could only pass 3.1 amperes maximum. The use of specific tolerance resistances is a much safer design practice for higher currents than the \\"zero-ohm\\" option, although the bill-of-materials cost can be higher for low-ohm devices.

Multiplicative digital roots are the multiplicative equivalent of digital roots.  Definition  Let n be a natural number. We define the digit product for base b > 1 F_{b} : \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{N} to be the following: :F_{b}(n) = \\\\prod_{i=0}^{k - 1} d_i where k = \\\\lfloor \\\\log_{b}{n} \\\\rfloor + 1 is the number of digits in the number in base b, and :d_i = \\\\frac{n \\\\bmod{b^{i+1}} - n \\\\bmod b^i}{b^i} is the value of each digit of the number. A natural number n is a multiplicative digital root if it is a fixed point for F_{b}, which occurs if F_{b}(n) = n. For example, in base b = 10, 0 is the multiplicative digital root of 9876, as : F_{10}(9876) = (9)(8)(7)(6) = 3024 : F_{10}(3024) = (3)(0)(2)(4) = 0 : F_{10}(0) = 0 All natural numbers n are preperiodic points for F_{b}, regardless of the base. This is because if n \\\\geq b, then :n = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{k - 1} d_i b^i and therefore :F_{b}(n) = \\\\prod_{i=0}^{k - 1} d_i = d_{k - 1} \\\\prod_{i=0}^{k - 2} d_i < d_{k - 1} b^{k - 1} < \\\\sum_{i=0}^{k - 1} d_i b^i = n If n < b, then trivially :F_{b}(n) = n Therefore, the only possible multiplicative digital roots are the natural numbers 0 \\\\leq n < b, and there are no cycles other than the fixed points of 0 \\\\leq n < b. Multiplicative persistence The number of iterations i needed for F_{b}^{i}(n) to reach a fixed point is the multiplicative persistence of n. The multiplicative persistence is undefined if it never reaches a fixed point. In base 10, it is conjectured that there is no number with a multiplicative persistence i > 11: this is known to be true for numbers n \\\\leq 10^{20585}. The smallest numbers with persistence 0, 1, ... are: :0, 10, 25, 39, 77, 679, 6788, 68889, 2677889, 26888999, 3778888999, 277777788888899. The search for these numbers can be sped up by using additional properties of the decimal digits of these record- breaking numbers. These digits must be sorted, and, except for the first two digits, all digits must be 7, 8, or 9. There are also additional restrictions on the first two digits. Based on these restrictions, the number of candidates for k-digit numbers with record-breaking persistence is only proportional to the square of k, a tiny fraction of all possible k-digit numbers. However, any number that is missing from the sequence above would have multiplicative persistence > 11; such numbers are believed not to exist, and would need to have over 20,000 digits if they do exist. Extension to negative integers The multiplicative digital root can be extended to the negative integers by use of a signed-digit representation to represent each integer. Programming example The example below implements the digit product described in the definition above to search for multiplicative digital roots and multiplicative persistences in Python. def digit_product(x: int, b: int) -> int: if x  0: return 0 total = 1 while x > 1: if x % b  0: return 0 if x % b > 1: total = total * (x % b) x = x // b return total def multiplicative_digital_root(x: int, b :int) -> int: seen = [] while x not in seen: seen.append(x) x = digit_product(x, b) return x def multiplicative_persistence(x: int, b: int) -> int: seen = [] while x not in seen: seen.append(x) x = digit_product(x, b) return len(seen) - 1 See also * Arithmetic dynamics * Digit sum * Digital root * Sum-product number  References  Literature  *  External links  * (Mar 21, 2019) Category:Algebra Category:Arithmetic dynamics Category:Base-dependent integer sequences Category:Number theory ","title":"Multiplicative digital root"},{"id":"12735878","text":"The following is a list of Mission hospitals.

Vacancy  The seat had become vacant when the sitting Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), William Pease had died on 23 January 1926, aged 60. He had held the seat since a by-election in 1923.  Candidates  The Liberal Party candidate was 51-year-old John Dickie, who had been the MP for Gateshead from 1923 until his defeat at the 1924 general election. The Labour Party candidate was 42-year-old Arthur Shepherd, and E. H. Pease stood for the Conservatives. Pease had not previously contested a parliamentary election, but Shepherd had contested Darlington in 1924, losing by over 2000 votes to William Pease.  Result  On a slightly increased turnout, the result was a narrow victory for Shepherd. His share of the vote was lower than in 1924, when there had been no Liberal candidate, but the presence of a Liberal in the by-election impacted more heavily on the Conservatives than on Labour.  Aftermath  Shepherd held the seat at the 1929 general election, but was defeated in 1931. Pease did not stand for Parliament again, but Dickie was elected in 1931 as National Liberal MP for Consett.

Early career to 1916 M√°ire Comerford (centre) with other Cumann na mBan women circa 1920 Comerford was born as Mary Eva Comerford on 2 June 1893 in Rathdrum, County Wicklow to a middle-class family. Her parents were James Comerford, a flour and corn miller, and Eva Mary Esmonde. Her grandfather, Thomas Esmonde was awarded a V.C. for bravery in the Crimean war in 1854. On his return to Ireland he joined the Royal Irish Constabulary and was promoted to Deputy Chief Inspector. Her father James Comerford was the owner of the Comerford Mill in Rathdrum. She had two brothers (Thomas and Alexander) and one sister (Dymphia). Her father died when she was sixteen and in 1911 she was sent to London to a secretarial school. During this time she stayed in the Ladies club in Eccles Place. She returned to Ireland to live along with her mother in the home of her uncle in Wexford, T. L. Esmonde, around 1915 her mother rented a house in Courtown, Co Wexford to set up a school. She was in Dublin during the outbreak of the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin and volunteered to aid Countess Markievicz in St Stephen's Green, but was turned away and carried despatches for the GPO garrison. She returned to Gorey after the rising and joined the local Sinn F√©in branch where she worked alongside Sean Etchingham. She returned to Dublin shortly before the 1918 General election, where she worked on Roger Sweetman's election campaign. On 21 January 1919 she attended the Round room at the Mansion House, witnessing the creation of the First Dail by the twenty-seven TDs present.Dail roll 21 January 1919 1916-1922 Comerford supported the prisoners taken in 1916 and the reordering of the Sinn F√©in party from 1917. It won a majority in the election of December 1918 and she was an observer when the First Dail was inaugurated on 19 January 1919. Supporting the IRA in the Dublin area during the Irish War of Independence, she also helped to run the Irish White Cross, led by the Quaker James Douglas, which aimed to assist civilian war victims by raising money in the United States. Civil War Before the Irish Civil War of 1922-23, Cumann na mBan had voted by 419-63 against the terms of the Anglo- Irish Treaty and wanted to maintain the Irish Republic. However this vote was taken after the Treaty had been approved by the D√°il on 7 January. In June 1922 she managed to escape from the Four Courts during the Battle of Dublin. The war further split the Sinn F√©in movement, and in 1923 Comerford was arrested and held at the women's section of Mountjoy Prison. In later years she felt that √âamon de Valera's suggestion in America in 1919-20 that Ireland's future relationship to Britain would be about the same as that of Cuba to the USA had started the mentality of compromise that had led on to the Treaty signed in 1921. Republican politics Following the civil war Comerford supported √âamon de Valera and his abstentionist Republican candidates, but split with him (as did MacSwiney) when he entered the D√°il in 1927. In 1926 he had established the Fianna F√°il party, which drew off a number of Cumann na mBan supporters and weakened it thereafter. She remained a member of what was from now on generally seen as a committed group which would not compromise in terms of everyday politics on constitutional matters. She never married. In 1935-65, despite their political differences, she worked as a journalist at de Valera's newspaper the Irish Press. In 1967 she worked on the restoration of the Tailors' Hall in Dublin with the Irish Georgian Society, which had housed Wolfe Tone's nascent republican parliament in the 1790s. In 1969 her book 'The First D√°il' was published by Joe Clarke. In the 1970s and up to her death she supported the Provisional Irish Republican Army war in Northern Ireland, in particular its hunger strike campaign. In 1976 she was interviewed for the 'Curious Journey' television documentary with other survivors of the 1914-23 period, later published as a book. She worked as a journalist until her retirement in the 1960s. M√°ire died on 15 December 1982 aged 89 and was buried in Mount Saint Benedict Cemetery in Gorey, Co Wexford.

The BANR was also the first railway company from the British islands to operate in Argentina. History=Background Tigre station, terminus (c. 1900) Recoleta was one of the stations of the line, later demolished When Central Station was destroyed by fire, terminus was moved to Retiro. In 1857 the government of Buenos Aires Province granted a concession to Eduardo Hopkins, owner of Buenos Aires and San Fernando Railway (in Spanish: \\"Ferrocarril de Buenos Aires a San Fernando\\") to build a railway from the city of Buenos Aires to San Fernando in Greater Buenos Aires, a distance of 28 km. The contract was signed between Hopkins and Gobernor of Buenos Aires, Valent√≠n Alsina, committing to build a horse-drawn railway that departed from Aduana Nueva (Paseo de Julio and Victoria) to Retiro where it transfer to a steam train, continuing the trip to Fernando, with several stops in Belgrano and San Isidro stations. Therefore, the \\"Compa√±√≠a del Ferrocarril a San Fernando\\" SA was established, with a capital of $ 750,000. The Province granted a 7% of interest for 20 years, apart from donating all the lands necessary for the construction of the railway. As the profit increased, the company committed to build stations in Retiro, Palermo and Olivos. Concession was declared forfeit due to the company did not to start works in the period of time stipulated, therefore a new concession was granted to Jos√© Rodney Crosky on February 25, 1862. Nevertheless, the concession was transferred again to \\"Compa√±√≠a del Ferrocarril del Norte de Buenos Aires\\", a company founded in London, on October 17. Expansion Works began in Retiro, and shortly after that, more precisely in December 1862, the line to \\"Valent√≠n Alsina\\" station (today \\"Belgrano C\\") was inaugurated. In 1863 the train reached San Isidro, with intermediate stops in Rivadavia and Olivos station. In February 1864 the Government allowed the company to use locomotives instead of horsecars for the Aduana-Retiro path. The railway continued its expansion, reaching San Fernando in 1864 and finally Tigre in 1865, totalizing 29 km length. Despite having requested an extension of the line to Z√°rate, the BANR would not build any track until it was transferred to Central Argentine Railway in 1889. By 1870 the railway stations were: 25 de Mayo (horsecars), Retiro, Palermo (then renamed \\"Recoleta\\" before being demolished), Belgrano, Rivadavia, Olivos, San Isidro, San Fernando and Tigre. During its first years, the BANR achieved positive business results, with 8.19% of interest in 1870 and 15.22% one year later. The company also built a little 1,700-metre length branch to San Fernando Canal, built by \\"Hopkins y Ocampo Constructora\\" and opened in 1872. The branch was run by freight trains that transported goods coming from the Littoral region. When the Port of Buenos Aires was opened in 1897, commercial activities on the branch decreased considerably. The San Fernando Canal branch was finally closed in the 1970s and most of the rail tracks removed by Ferrocarriles Argentinos, the operator by then. Central Station On the initiative of Buenos Aires and Ensenada Port Railway, on December 31, 1872, the Central Station of Buenos Aires was opened. This was placed on the junction of Paseo de Julio Avenue and Bartolom√© Mitre. The station was terminus of several railway lines, such as Buenos Aires Western Railway and Buenos Aires and Rosario Railway on a side, and the BA&E; and Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway on the other side. The access station building, the BA&E; had to extend the long viaduct that originally extended from Casa Amarilla to Venezuela stations. When Central Station was destroyed by fire on February 14, 1897, BANR (owned by Central Argentine by then) and BA&E; moved their terminus to Retiro and Venezuela, respectively. Soon after the BA&E; moved again to Casa Amarilla in La Boca district, therefore the iron viaduct that crossed the city fell into disuse, being subsequently demolished. In 1888 the company was taken over by the Central Argentine Railway.

The founders were mainly left-wing Chilean politicians close to the government of ousted President Salvador Allende, and who had fled into exile following the 1973 coup d'√©tat by general Augusto Pinochet. Among them, the most prominent were Pinochet victim Bernardo Leighton and Jos√© Antonio Viera-Gallo Quesney, who later became the first post-Pinochet president of Chile's Chamber of Deputies (the lower chamber of parliament) in the government of Patricio Aylwin. The institution, in receipt of funding by leading Italian socialists including Bettino Craxi and Rino Formica, promoted the academic study of Chilean affairs, with the implicit intent of opposing the Pinochet regime, and favouring a return to democracy in the country. From 1989 onwards, the founding exiles started to return to Chile. In 1991 following the exit from power of General Pinochet, the centre was officially established in Chile's capital Santiago. Whilst remaining firm to its objectives and its political ideology, its academic work gradually left the place to publishing, and the centre established itself as one of Chile's most prominent publishing houses.

It was produced in the West End, London, where it received the Evening Standard Comedy of the Year Award, and on Broadway, New York. Plot The play concerns eight individuals from disparate backgrounds and with differing motivations who attend the same weekly tap dancing class in a dingy North London church hall. Despite the students at first treating the classes as social occasions, and showing little co-ordination, they later develop a level of skill and cohesiveness. The dance routines are the background for the focus of the play, the relationship and interaction of different people. Background According to the play's writer, Richard Harris, the inspiration for the show came from his own wife, actress Hilary Crane: \\"My wife started her career as a dancer and she liked to keep her foot in, as it were, so she went down to the local dance class and when she came back she suggested that I should go and have a look as she felt there might be a play in it for me\\". aking his wife's advice, Harris visited the local church hall, a setting very much like the one in the play, where a tap dance class was in progress. \\"My wife hadn't been to the tap dance class\\", he explained. \\"She went to join a modern dance group, so it was by pure luck that I happened to go there and look through the window when a tap dance class was going on. It struck me that they all seemed to be thoroughly enjoying themselves and I thought if I could capture that, the pleasure they are clearly getting out of the class, I might be a winner. So I spent a period researching and going to various dance classes and then wrote the play\\".

Birchley Hall was bought by Christopher Anderton of Lostock, Bolton in about 1581. The present building was built by one son, James and extended by another son, Thurston in 1594. There is an inscription stone carved with 'TA 1594' on the front of the house, TA being attributed to Thurston. Thurston died in 1598 or 1599 and another brother, Christopher, lived at the Hall with his wife Anne Scarisbrick till 1613, when James died, and he inherited Lostock Hall. Another brother, Roger, lived at Birchley Hall till his death in 1640. The Birchley Hall press During the Reformation Birchley Hall was in the county of Lancashire, which was a stronghold for Roman Catholics during their persecution during the reigns of Henry VIII, who destroyed and plundered many monasteries (much of their riches were given to Oxford University colleges), and Queen Elizabeth I. Catholics, especially priests, were driven underground and Catholic literature was vigorously suppressed. A secret Catholic printing press was set up at Birchley Hall, possibly in about 1604, by Thurstan, whose wife Norris of Speke was a Catholic, or recusant as they were known then. Roger Anderton more certainly ran a printing press from about 1613. About 19 titles are attributed to the Birchley Hall Press by the English Short Title Catalogue of the British Library. Many of the books are in the name of John Brerely, which is thought to be a pseudonym of Lawrence Anderton, a cousin of James and his brothers. He was the youngest son of Lawrence Anderton of Chorley, was educated at Blackburn Grammar School, and entered Christ's College, Cambridge University in 1593. He is thought to have originally taken orders in the Anglican Church but went to Rome in 1604 and subsequently joined the Society of Jesus. He published a volume of poems in 1601 in London and The Protestant Apologie in 1604, which may be his first book after becoming a Catholic priest. The Birchley Hall chapel One wing of the Hall contains a chapel which was used for secret religious services. According to \\"Secret Hiding Places\\" published in 1933, there was a trap door in the vestry floor concealed inside a confessional box. This led to the floor below and into the Hall and would have been used for priest to escape discovery. In 1920 a fall of plaster disclosed a secret door to a short tunnel in the wall leading to a look-out in the roof, from which the approach to the house could be watched. It was in poor condition at the time. Hiding places were also discovered (date unknown). In one of these chalices and vestments were found, which were subsequently kept at the local catholic church. A chalice, however, was stolen from the church in the 1970s. There are also reports of books being found under the floor during a restoration in the 1920s, including an early edition of Ptolemy's Geography. It is not known what happened to these. Birchley Hall was bought by Vincent Wood from his cousin Joseph Middlehurst in 1945. His son Bernard partially restored the chapel up to the 1970s, when the Hall was sold to the charity Sue Ryder Care, which converted it into a home for the elderly. The chapel was fully restored for interdenominational use, and as of 2012 the Foundation still runs the Hall as a care centre for the elderly. The new Birchley Hall Press The word 'press' is used as a descriptive term for the printing operation in the early times, as it is not likely to have been used as a formal title ‚Äî especially as it would have given away the location of the illegal printing press. The Birchley Hall Press was resurrected by Bernard Wood, and formally named as such, in 1951 in the same building as the original press, with the publication of This is the Faith (author Francis J Ripley). The actual printing, however, was done by Wood Westworth & Co Ltd a printing company in St Helens, Merseyside, owned by Vincent Wood (and founded by the family in about 1860). A few further titles were published up to at least 1960, including A Flame for Africa (1953) and Liverpool's Hidden Story (1957). The Birchley Hall Press was resurrected a second time in 2007 by Harry Wood, son of Bernard Wood. It is now based in Farnborough, Hampshire, UK and publishes two online magazines, The British Journal of Healthcare Computing and Information Management (www.bjhcim.co.uk) and Medical Technology Business Europe (www.mtbeurope.info), and the website Tropical Trees for Life (www.treesforlife.info) a green project to propagate some of the large amounts of important information on tree planting and management in the tropics that is locked in a few paper copies and that should be made globally accessible to give it a greater chance of reaching those who could benefit from it.

Early life Jean-Baptiste Marie de Piquet was born on 5 August 1729 in Arles, France, during the time of the Great Plague of Marseille. The heroism of his father, Guillaume de Piquet (1689-1747), the Marquess of M√©janes, resulted in the land of M√©janes being raised to marquisate status in 1723. Piquet inherited this land in 1748 following his father's death. Piquet was educated at the Coll√®ge Louis-le-Grand, where his love of reading and books was noticed early on. Career Piquet was the Marquess of M√©janes, the Lord of Albaron, and the Lord of Saint Vincent. He served as the First Consul of Arles from 1761 to 1774 and the Royal Secretary of Arles in 1766 and 1784. He also served as the First Consul of Aix-en- Provence and State Prosecutor of Provence from 1777 to 1778. He worked diligently to improve the lot of his fellow citizens. Personal life Piquet was a bibliophile and a book collector. He had the reputation of being an intelligent, honest, simple, and modest man. A large part of his income went toward books. In 1759, he married Marie Gabrielle Massilian, imposing on her a relatively austere and economical life despite his fortune. On his deathbed, he regretted this lifestyle and wrote his final words to his wife on 30 September 1786: \\"[I] ask again forgiveness, if I did not contribute to your happiness, as much as I I would have liked during the time that we were united together.\\" Death and legacy He moved to Paris in 1783, where he died on 5 October 1786 without a descendant, his son Joseph Marie Marc Antoine de Piquet having died on 4 August 1760 at the age of 6 months and a half. His sole heir was his nephew, the Marquis de Lagoy. In his will, he bequeathed all his books, between 60,000 and 80,000 volumes, to Provence, under the stipulation that they be made accessible to ordinary citizens. He also added a yearly legacy of 5,000 books in annuities for Provence, to continue increasing the number of the collection. This bequest led to the creation of the public library of Aix-en-Provence known as the Biblioth√®que M√©janes. His bust, designed by Jean-Antoine Houdon, is displayed in the library.

The SL66 represented a change in direction for Rollei, which until that time had focused almost exclusively on its popular twin lens reflex cameras, the Rolleiflex and Rolleicord.  History  In 1957, an agreement between Reinhold Heidecke, inventor of the Rolleiflex TLR, and Victor Hasselblad, inventor of the Hasselblad SLR, was reached to ensure that Rollei would not manufacture SLR cameras, and Hasselblad would not manufacture TLR cameras. However, the rapid adoption of SLRs during the 1960s meant that Rollei risked falling behind in this market, at the same time that demand for its TLRs was decreasing. In 1964 plans were made to create a new, technologically advanced SLR to be introduced at the 1966 photokina festival.  Features  Like the Rolleiflex TLR and the Hasselblad SLR, the SL66 uses 120 or 220 film to produce frames of 6√ó6 cm. It also incorporates several features that are unique or noteworthy in an SLR camera: * Reverse-mounting lenses. Most SL66 lenses (with the exception of the very wide or very long lenses) could be reversed and mounted to the camera without adapters, for use in close-up macro photography. * Lens bellows to accommodate focusing when the lenses are reverse-mounted. Again, this is impossible for most SLR cameras without special adapters. * Lens tilt movement. The lenses could be tilted up to 8 degrees either up or down, to take advantage of the Scheimpflug principle, enabling greater depth of field, especially in close-up photographs. The SL66 uses a focal-plane shutter, although several lenses were available in leaf shutters to enable much higher flash synchronization speeds. Several later cameras based on the SL66 were made, including the SL66E, SL66X, and SL66SE. The most prominent changes in these newer models involved increased use of electronics in metering and flash synchronization. The SL66SE remained in production until 1992.

Host-based zoning is usually referred to as persistent binding or LUN,mapping and is perhaps the least implemented form of zoning. Because it requires the host configuration to be correct in order to avoid zoning conflicts, this form of zoning creates a greater opportunity for administrative errors and conflicting access to targets. Moreover, zoning interfaces vary among different host operating systems and HBA's ‚Äî increasing the possibility for administrative errors. If a host is not configured with the zoning software, it can access all devices in the fabric and create an even higher probability of data corruption. Host-based zoning is often used when clusters are implemented to control the mapping of devices to specificSCSI target IDs. However, it should never be the only form of zoning. Augmenting host-based zoning with storage- and fabric-based zoning is the only acceptable method to reliably control device access and data security. Basically, A given LUN has it SCSI id assigned by its RAID device (typically a SAN ). But for some purposes it's useful to have the SCSI id assigned by the host itself: that's persistent binding. What is Persistent binding for ? Without persistent binding, after every reboot, the SCSI id of a LUN may change. For Example, under Linux, a LUN bound on /dev/sda could migrate to /dev/sdb after a reboot. The risks augments with multipathing. Based on that, it is obvious that many software may crash without persistent binding. from http://www.storagesearch.com/datalink-art1.html :Operating systems and upper- level applications (such as backup software) typically require a static or predictable SCSI target ID for their storage reliability and persistent binding affords that happening. Types of zoning A zone can include host and LUNS. The LUNS are exported by the DISK ARRAY, the hosts are the clients (servers, computers). Each host in a zone can access each LUNS in the same zone. That's zoning. The zone is usually set on the central point of connection of the hosts and the DISK ARRAY: the FC switch. LUN masking from Fibre Channel zoning :Zoning is sometimes confused with LUN masking, because it serves the same goals. LUN masking, however, works on Fibre channel level 4 (i.e. on SCSI level), while zoning works on level 2. This allows zoning to be implemented on switches, whereas LUN masking is performed on endpoint devices - host adapters or disk array controllers. Some fibre channel switches allow zoning at the LUN level, effectively implementing LUN masking at the switch. Here, we are talking about level 4. This form of zoning has to be augmented by another zoning : RAID ARRAY based or fabric-based(FC switch) to improve security and avoid any errors. Otherwise two hosts may access the same data(LUNS) at the same time and it will result in data corruption. Persistent binding is often used in a cluster environment, to associate a LUN with a persistent SCSI id and device (example /dev/sda) ReferencesExternal links * http://www.storagesearch.com/datalink-art1.html * http://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/sans/features/print.php/11188_1431341_2 Category:Storage area networks Category:SCSI Category:Fibre Channel Category:Computer storage buses ","title":"Persistent binding"},{"id":"12736476","title":"Melese Feissa"},{"id":"12736483","text":"Tighe's Hill is a north-western suburb of Newcastle, New South Wales and was named after A.A.P.

Veljko's grandfather is Colonel Jeremija Stanojeviƒá (1808-1869), who was the minister of justice and education in the Principality of Serbia, president of the Supreme Court, president of the Serbian Learned Society, state advisor. His grandmother is Marija Mara Nenadoviƒá, daughter of Mateja Nenadoviƒá, grandson of Prince Aleksa Nenadoviƒá. According to his grandmother's lineage, he was related to the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá. Veljko Stanojeviƒá's training in painting began at the School of Arts and Crafts in Belgrade with Ljubomir Ivanoviƒá and Marko Murat. Upon graduation, he joined the Serbian Supreme Command as a volunteer and war artist. In late 1919, he moved to Paris where he studied at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re for two years and then decided to live there until 1930. He is a representative of constructivist painting in Serbia, while his later work reoriented to coloristic expressionism. His work in the spirit of \\"idealized reality\\", which emerged in the 1920s, is considered by critics to be his most authentic creative period, making Veljko Stanojeviƒá one of our most significant painters of the third decade of the 20th century. He exhibited for the first time in Belgrade in 1922 and later at numerous group and solo exhibitions in Yugoslavia, Europe, and America.https://eng.msub.org.rs/veljko- stanojevic-a-modernist-and-a- classichttp://www.politika.rs/scc/clanak/321485/Veljko-Stanojevic-dosledni- klasik On the occasion of the exhibition in the RTS gallery, art critic Stanislav Zivkoviƒá wrote about Veljko Stanojeviƒá's painting: One of the bards who participated in the development of modern expression in Serbian painting from the very beginning was Veljko Stanojeviƒá. Through more than fifty years of artistic activity, he went through and experienced all its stages: as a curious beginner, then as a mature artist and a fighter for the contemporary, finally as a slightly weary observer, who left the arena younger and belligerent. The fact remains that Veljko Stanojeviƒá is one of our significant painters and pioneers, whose work between the two wars largely determined the life of new art. Together with ≈Ωivorad Nastasijeviƒá, Vasa Pomori≈°ac and Ivan Radoviƒá, he characterizes those tendencies in Serbian painting that, beginning with the achievements of C√©zanne and the latest achievements of the Cubists, sought to achieve, through well-understood modernism, the purity of sobriety of the great classics.http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/ci/story/8/%D0%9A%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B0/44122/%D0%98%D0%B7%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B1%D0%B0+%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0+%D0%92%D0%B5%D1%99%D0%BA%D0%B0+%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%98%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%9B%D0%B0 Veljko Stanojeviƒá's paintings are on display at the National Museum in Belgrade, the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Museum of Natural History.

Bedia Cathedral was originally built at the close of the 10th century and consecrated in 999 on the behest of King Bagrat II of Abkhazia, who would go on to become the first King of the Georgia as Bagrat III and who was interred at the church after his death. The extant edifices, however, date back to the 13th-14th centuries and include a domed cruciform church, a belltower resting upon the northern narthex and the ruins of an old palace. The southern wall of the main church contains fragments of contemporary murals, including the portraits of Bagrat II and the representatives of the Dadiani noble family of Georgia. In the Catholicate of Abkhazia, Bedia was the centre of a diocese and the seat of a bishop. In the 17th century, services were ceased, but resumed from the second half of the 19th century onwards. Historical - architectural description As evidenced by the historic sources, complex was erected in late 10th century, 999, by Bagrat III, the first king of the united Georgian Kingdom, who, as stated by the Georgian chronicler, ‚Äúmade a Bishop out of it‚Äù. The church of the Virgin, erected in the centre of the monastic courtyard, is the main church of the monastery. To its west is the two-storied palace of metropolitans of Bedia. The church of the Virgin was considerably transformed between 13th to 15th centuries. The bell-tower is a 12th-14th cc. structure, while the Bishops' Palace was built in the 16th century by Anton Zhuanisdze, a Georgian Metropolitan of Bedia. Three layers of mural decoration are preserved in the church interior, which date back the 10th-11th, 13th-14th, and 16th-17th cc. bell-tower, ground floor of which functions as a gate to the monastery, while from the south the two-storied Episcopal palace is adjoined. Facades of the Bedia church, its interior murals and ecclesiastic objects preserved lapidary inscriptions in Georgian Asomtavruli (uncial) script, bearing evidences on the construction, renovation and restoration of the church. Over the centuries, Bedia Episcopal See was one of the most significant ecclesiastical, cultural and educational centre of Georgia. Archbishop Anton Zhuanisdze had established a rich library in the Bedia monastery, where old manuscripts were renovated and restored, theological treatises were translated and the library collection was enriched with new manuscripts. Bedia monastic complex is a symbol of unity and indivisibility of Georgia. Bagrat III, the first king of the united Georgian kingdom and his mother, Queen Gurandukht are buried in Bedia. Bedia church landscape characteristic to the Middle Ages Georgian architecture was being created on such an ensemble of planning. A church capped with a cupola represented the main architectural element of the ensemble. The complex was surrounded with a fence. On its west side, in the line of the fence wall, there is a bishop‚Äôs palace and a doorway included. The ruins of the bishop‚Äôs palace are located in the west of the church, in approximately 50 meters‚Äô distance. In the beginning, it consisted of two stories. Nowadays, the second floor is almost totally destroyed, only the fragments of the north-west corner and western wall are remained. The door that leads to the second store-room contains a timpani stone bearing an inscription on it, in which the spiritual Georgian workers of the 16th century such as the archbishop of Bedia, Anton Zhuanidze, and restorer Kirile Zhuanidze, are mentioned. The arc entrance is adorned with decorative ornaments. Inter-story roofing was repaired during the restoration of 1968-69 the floor was concreted and onto it, an isolation stratum was arranged from a thin layer of the tar, which prevents the first floor from water leakage. The doorway is located in the western part of the complex, on top of which a bell tower of the church was arranged. On its west, on the fa√ßade, there is an inscription in which Giorgi Dadiani and King Constantine are mentioned, living in the 14th century. The building of the doorway is joined to the palace and is perceived as one whole. The doorway represents a planning square. The church with a cupola is the central building of the complex, typically similar to so-called ‚Äúinserted cross‚Äù. In the plan, it is a cross inscribed in the rectangle. In the center of the church, on the square that we see on the crossroads of the cross arms, a cupola consisting of 14 facets is made by means of sails, in which the windows of the same quantity are cut. The cupola is based on two separately standing pillars in the west, and on the apses in the east. The eastern arm of the cross ends with an apse, whilst the remaining arms are rectangular. The space that is left between the arms of the cross is filled with two-storied store-rooms located beside the apses on the east, and by additional spaces on the west. The smaller floor located beside the apses represents a mass of entire wall, in which a small door is cut. The upper gallery is located on the second floor of the northern and southern naves. One can ascend by a ladder. The church has three entrances. A cupola is erased exactly in the center of the church. From the outside, the church is built with a cleanly trimmed sandstone. All the windows of the church are preserved. In the interior, their contour is safe. On the facades, besides two of them, all the windows are damaged. They have no adornments. In the end of the 19th century, the Bedia Church already represented a depopulated edifice, covered with plants, however, the big part of the cupola was preserved and the laying of apses was better protected. After this, in the beginning of the 20th century, with the aim to ‚Äúrenovate‚Äù the church, Russian monks and nuns totally removed the damaged cupola and took out the easily removable stones.

He plays hurling with his local club Patrickswell and was a member of the Limerick senior inter-county team from 2006 until 2009. Playing career=Club Murray plays his club hurling with the famous Patrickswell club just outside Limerick city. He was born into a family that had a strong association with hurling. His father, Terence Murray, was also a member of the Patrickswell club and refereed the 1987 and 1993 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship finals between Galway and Kilkenny. After enjoying little success as minor or under-21 levels he subsequently joined the club's senior team. After beginning as an outfield player Murray was later chosen as goalkeeper on the team and has remained in that position since 2005. He played in his first senior county final in 2006, however, victory went to Bruree on that occasion. Inter-county Murray first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Limerick senior inter-county team in 2005. He lined out in a challenge game against Tipperary in late 2005, a game which Limerick won with Murray keeping a clean sheet as goalkeeper. He impressed in that game and made his competitive debut against the same opposition in a National Hurling League game in early 2006. Murray remained as the first-choice goalkeeper for all but one game of the National League. The team remained unbeaten and qualified for the final against Kilkenny. It was an unhappy day for Limerick as 'the Cats' won the day by 3‚Äì11 0‚Äì14. Murray's performances were so impressive that he edged out Timmy Houlihan as the regular Limerick goalkeeper for the championship. He made his debut in the Munster championship against Tipperary, however, Limerick's championship losing streak continued and they were defeated. After moving successfully through the qualifier system Murray's side later played defending champions Cork in the All-Ireland quarter-final. Although the team only lost by a point it was a game that Limerick could easily have won. In 2007 Limerick faced near neighbours Tipperary in the semi-final of the Munster championship. That game ended in a draw with both sides scoring 1‚Äì19. The replay saw Limerick in arrears by ten points at half-time, however, Murray's side rallied to level the game at the end of normal time. A period of extra time failed to separate the sides and a score line of 1‚Äì24 to 2‚Äì21 resulted in a second replay. Once again, Limerick looked vulnerable at times during the game, however, they grinded out a victory with a score line of 0‚Äì22 to 2‚Äì13. It was Limerick's first win in the Munster championship since 2001. Murray later lined out against Waterford in the Munster final, however, they were defeated on a score line of 3‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì14. These two sides later met again in the All-Ireland semi- final, however, manager Richie Bennis had done his homework and masterminded a surprise 5‚Äì11 to 2‚Äì15 victory over the Munster champions. This victory allowed Murray's side to play Kilkenny in the championship decider. Unfortunately, Limerick got off to a bad start with Murray letting in two goals by Eddie Brennan and Henry Shefflin in the first ten minutes. Limerick fought back, however, 'the Cats', however, went on to win the game by six points. In spite of this loss Murray was later presented with his first All-Star award, marking him out as the best goalkeeper in the championship. After the highs of the previous year, 2008 proved to be a difficult year for the Limerick hurlers. The team were trounced by 4‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì16 in opening game of the championship by Clare. The newly structured qualifier system pitted Murray's side against Offaly in a must-win game. Limerick, however, were out of sorts as Murray left in three goals leading to a 3‚Äì19 to 0‚Äì18 defeat. Limerick's involvement in the championship came to an end following this trouncing. In 2009 Justin McCarthy took over as Limerick manager. After a poor showing in the National League, Limerick's first championship assignment was a Munster semi-final showdown with Waterford. That game, described by many pundits as the worst game in the history of the provincial championship, ended in a draw. The replay was a big improvement, however, Murray ended up on the losing side by 0‚Äì25 to 0‚Äì17. Limerick later manoeuvred through the qualifiers, narrowly defeating Wexford, Laois and Dublin. It was the first time that Limerick secured three championship victories in-a-row since 1996. In the game against 'the Dubs' Murray was brought all the way up the field to convert a penalty. A four-point victory allowed Limerick to advance to the All-Ireland semi-final against Tipperary. Inter-provincial Murray has also lined out with Munster in the Railway Cup inter-provincial competition. He captured a winners medal in this competition in 2007 as Munster defeated Connacht.

The instrument is also known as the Vox Teardrop, but this is not the official name. The Vox Mark came in three variations, a 6 string (the Mark VI), a 9 string (the Mark IX) and a 12 string (the Mark XII) History In 1962, Vox introduced the pentagonal Phantom guitar, originally made in Kent, England but soon after made by EKO of Italy. It was followed a year later by the teardrop-shaped Mark VI, the prototype of which was made specifically for Brian Jones of The Rolling Stones, using a non-tremolo Fender Stratocaster bridge. The Mark VI was released in three versions, as a 6-string, a 9-string, and a 12-string. The 9-string had three wound strings and three pairs of unwound strings. The Phantom guitar received an international prize for best design when it was released. Even though Vox discontinued the production of these guitars in the seventies, accurate copies of the Teardrop and other Vox models are still manufactured by Jack Charles of Phantom Guitarworks. In the late 1990s, Vox reissued USA manufactured versions of the Phantom, Mark III Teardrops and Mando Guitars. The USA made guitars are considered by many to be the most playable versions of these instruments ever made. To celebrate their 50th Anniversary in 2007, Vox commissioned a limited run of 100 pcs to be USA manufactured, Mark III, 2 pickup, fixed bridge, antique white \\"Teardrops\\" For 2011, Vox has reintroduced the iconic droplet body shape in its new APACHE Series.

Mark XII In the mid 1960s, as the sound of electric 12-string guitars became popular, Vox introduced the Phantom XII and Mark XII electric 12-string guitars as well as the Tempest XII, also made in Italy, which featured a more conventional body style. Vox produced a number of other models of 6 and 12 string electric guitars in both England and Italy. Guitar effects pedals, including an early version of the wah-wah, used by Jimi Hendrix, and the Tone Bender fuzzbox pedal, used by Jimmy Page of the Yardbirds, were also manufactured.

Life Pedro Berm√∫dez was born 1558 in Granada, Spain. From an early age he was a choirboy in the cathedral of his home town, where he was taught by Santos de Aliseda. He later was a pupil of composition of Rodrigo de Ceballos (1530‚Äì81) at the Royal Chapel of Granada. In 1584, Berm√∫dez won the position of chapel master in Antequera, where he experienced continued strain and pressure from the church dignitaries, as he showed little inclination to teach the choirboys. After two years in that position he was dismissed following a fight with one of the choir singers. Returning to Granada, he became a singer in the Royal Chapel. In 1595 he was invited by Antonio de la Raya, newly appointed bishop of Cusco, Peru, to follow him to the New World and become the chapel master at the cathedral of that ancient Inca city, now Spanish. He commenced his activities in Cusco in September 1597. After only seven weeks, however, he took to the sea again, boarding a ship that sailed to Guatemala. In 1598 he was at the cathedral of Santiago de Guatemala, present-day Antigua Guatemala, where he composed most of his music. In 1603 he left Guatemala, invited by the chapter of the cathedral of Puebla, in New Spain, to become chapel master there. However, soon after his arrival his health declined, and he died towards the end of 1605 at the age of 47. Works All of the works of Pedro Berm√∫dez are sacred compositions on Latin texts of the Roman Catholic liturgy, for 4 to 8 voice unaccompanied chorus. With only one exception, the entirety of his musical output is extant in Guatemala City. Two of his Masses have survived: the Misa de Bomba, a parody Mass based on Mateo Flecha's (c. 1481-c.1553) choral composition Ensalada \\"La bomba\\", and the Misa de feria, to be sung during penitential times. The Guatemalan choir books also preserve a collection of hymns for vespers and compline of different liturgical occasions, the psalm Miserere mei, 2 lamentations, and 3 passions for Holy Week. The works of Pedro Berm√∫dez reveal an impressive and imaginative command of 16th century counterpoint. They also reflect the high quality of cathedral music in the New World, which was at the same level with liturgical music in Spanish and other European cathedrals. References * * Dieter Lehnhoff.

During World War I, he worked in both French and American military hospitals. In 1970, he was elected into the College Football Hall of Fame. Biography=Background Hunter was born in Erie Pennsylvania on October 16, 1885. He was the seventh son of John and Nancy Bell Scarlett. His mother was born near Cookstown in County Tyrone, in what is now Northern Ireland, while his father was born in Liverpool, England. After graduating from Erie High School in 1902, Hunter enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania. College football career He played four years of varsity football at Penn, as an end. In an era in which players were more likely to become injured, Hunter was never taken out of a game due to an injury. In 1908, he and halfback Bill Hollenback led the Quakers to an 11-0-1 record and the National Championship. During the season, the Quakers out-scored their opponents, 215-18, and their perfect record was marred only by a 6-6 tie against the Carlisle Indians. Hunter was awarded All-American honors that season. Hollenback lavished praise upon Scarlett after the 1908 campaign, saying: \\"He's one of college football's greatest ends. He's a superlative defensive end, quick to get down-field on punts and an exceptional diagnostician.\\" Early medical career Scarlett graduated from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1911. He then interned at the Pennsylvania Hospital. A year later, he was appointed Chief Resident of the American Hospital of Paris. There he began the study of ophthalmology under Dr. Victor Morax, who was then the Professor of Ophthalmology at Lariboisi√®re Hospital, and later became his assistant. One of Scarlett's articles on a form of diplobacillus \\"not yet described,\\" causing corneal infection, was titled \\"Diplobacilli scarletti\\". World War I On August 1, 1914, World War I broke out in Europe; The American Hospital of Paris, with the encouragement of the French Government opened a second, much larger military hospital in the Lyce√© Pastuer school building located at Neuilly-sur-Seine in Paris Dr. Scarlett then became one of the many founders of this hospital. The American Ambulance Hospital was financed by donations from the wealthy American Colony of Paris as well as contributions from the United States. Dr. Scarlett was appointed as an ophthalmologist to the American Ambulance and held that position until 1916. He was also appointed Ophthalmologist to the Whitney War Hospital (American Ambulance Hospital B), located on the Marne River. The Whitney Hospital was entirely financed by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, wife of wealthy financier Harry Payne Whitney and Great-Grand Daughter of \\"Commodore\\" Cornelius Vanderbilt. The Whitney Hospital which was a branch of the American Ambulance Hospital on the Marne battlefield, during this time. In order to operate at the Whitney War Hospital, he was usually forced to leave Paris at sundown in an unlighted automobile. His vehicle could only be seen by a low red cross on the radiator and he had to drive between the battle's shell holes and debris. Operating was done there at night with inadequate lighting and equipment, and his return trip to Paris was made just before dawn. Dr. Scarlett was also ophthalmologist to the \\"Phare\\", a Paris branch of the New York Light House for the Blind, caring for patients blinded by the war. In 1916, after two years of acting chief of two war hospitals and assistant at a third, Scarlett was taken seriously ill with what appeared to be meningitis, but was later thought to be sleeping sickness. At this time, he had been caring for a group was a part of General Gallieni's \\"taxicab army\\" that held the front line at the Marne river, during the first weeks of the war. He was sent back to the United States and after six months of rest, he began practicing again in Philadelphia. In 1918, he volunteered in the United States Army and served at U. S. Hospital No. 11, in Cape May, New Jersey, as an assistant ophthalmologist. In 1920, the French government awarded him the M√©daille de la Reconnaissance fran√ßaise. Post-war activities In 1920, Scarlett was appointed ophthalmologist at Bryn Mawr Hospital and held a similar appointment at Pennsylvania Hospital. Finally in March 1939, he was forced to retire due to health issues. During this time he wrote many articles for several American ophthalmological journals. Hunter Scarlett died on December 23, 1954, at age 69.

The only known species, Scaniornis lundgreni, lived in the MP 1‚Äì5 (Early Paleocene, perhaps Middle Paleocene: c. 65‚Äì59 million years ago). It is known from a partial fossil skeleton of a right wing, namely the coracoid, scapula and humerus found at Limhamn (Sweden) and other bones found at Selk, Germany. Thus, it would seem to have been a native of the prehistoric North Sea, which at that time covered part of today's Germany and France, and sometimes was cut off from the Tethys and Atlantic Oceans, sometimes connected to them, and sometimes even to the Turgai Sea. Situated a bit southwestwards ‚Äî between 44¬∞ and 54¬∞ North ‚Äî of its present location due to plate tectonics, in a fairly wet and warm epoch, the region had probably a warm-temperate to subtropical and fairly humid climate, altogether not too dissimilar from today's Black Sea region or French Mediterranean. It appears to be somewhat similar to flamingos and was long placed with these, and thus would strongly suggest that the Phoenicopteriformes evolved in the Late Cretaceous of immediately thereafter. As flamingos are now thought to be related to grebes,See Flamingo for details. the placement of Scaniornis requires reanalysis (Ml√≠kovsk√Ω 2002). It was also united with other wading or presumed shorebirds into the \\"Graculavidae\\", a form taxon of \\"transitional shorebirds\\". This group is now known to be paraphyletic and has no standing in systematics anymore. The presumed relative Parascaniornis is now known to be a hesperornithine of the genus Baptornis. The Hesperornithes which became extinct by the end of the Cretaceous and Scaniornis which appears clearly a neornithine are not closely related at all. Scaniornis was sometimes united with the Cretaceous Gallornis in the family Scaniornithidae. Gallornis, however, is of even more unclear relationships; it might be an early member of the Galloanserae. In any case it was subsequently not considered close to Scaniornis anymore but rather united with the supposed \\"Cretaceous proto-flamingos\\" \\"Parascaniornis\\" and Torotix, none of which seems even reasonably close to flamingos today.See also the discussion in Sibley et al.

This weapon is designed for the 5.8√ó21mm DCV05 sub-sonic round that is also used by the QSW-06 Silenced Pistol. Development On October 2001 the Jianshe Industries (Group) Corporation (owned by the China South Industries Group) won a bid to produce the PLA's next generation of submachine gun to replace the Type 79 and the Type 85 silenced submachine guns, beating out other competitors such as the Changfeng CF-05 due to its ease of construction and operation. At the 2005 International Police Equipment Expo in Beijing, Jianshe revealed their final product, a bullpup, blowback, open bolt submachine gun that externally resembled the QBZ-95 assault rifle which was then given the designation QCW-05. At the 2006 MILIPOL Expo, a smaller police and export version of the QCW-05 called the 'Jianshe JS 9mm', a silenced submachine gun, was revealed to the public. The 'JS 9mm' is chambered for the popular 9√ó19mm Parabellum calibre. The QCW-05 is intended to be PLA's frontline personal defence weapon for personnel in non-combat roles such as vehicle crews and aircrews who would normally be confined to quarters where a full assault rifle would be unwieldy and by specialised operation units such as the People's Liberation Army Special Operations Forces and People's Armed Police. Design details Outline of QCW-05s four column, fifty round, proprietary magazine The QCW-05 is a blowback, open bolt bullpup silenced submachine gun that is capable of either full automatic or semi-automatic fire. The QCW-05s light weight can be attributed to its small aluminum receiver and polymer construction which also lends itself well towards quicker mass-production. It has a low rate of fire in order to maintain controllability, a feature stressed from the beginning by the PLA for a weapon as light as a submachine gun. There is a thumb fire mode selector on the left side of the weapon directly above the grip with a semi- automatic position (1), full automatic (2), and safety (0) and an ejection port on the right side of the weapon. A removable metal screw-on cylindrical suppressor is attached to the barrel of the gun. The carrying handle, which is located above the compact aluminium receiver, houses the charging handle. The use of the 5.8√ó21mm DV05 subsonic round reduced the QCW-05's muzzle velocity to approximately 150 m/s and gives the submachine gun an effective range of 50 metres which is considered adequate for a silenced weapon. Ammunition is fed from a detachable curved fifty round, four column, double stacked box (another initial requirement of the PLA) at the rear of the submachine gun. As the QCW-05 is designed for general military use rather than being used only in a specialised niche role, a suppressor can be a hindrance when a situation calls for an emphasis on the performance or size of the weapon rather than its noise reduction capabilities, which is why the suppressor is removable, or in the case of the QCQ-05 variant, completely absent. Once the suppressor is removed, the QCW-05 is essentially the same as the QCQ-05 and can fire the DAP92 round as well. The QCW-05 shares the common trait of other bullpup weapons of being suboptimal to fire from the left shoulder given the placement of the ejection port and its proximity to the operator's face when firing. Variants The QCW-05 with a suppressor There are two variants of the QCW-05; the JS 9mm and the QCQ-05. JS 9mm A slightly smaller, somewhat externally different version of the QCW-05 designed for use by police and for export overseas. The JS 9mm is chambered for the 9√ó19mm Parabellum cartridge, and it also uses the same 30 round magazines used by the popular Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine gun. Another noticeable difference is that JS 9mm doesn't have a carrying handle, instead a picatinny rail could be mounted on the top. QCQ-05 The QCQ-05 () (officially translated in pinyin as QiƒÅng Ch≈çngfƒìng Qƒ´ngx√≠ng, literally 'Gun, Assault, Light') is a variant of the QCW-05 without the suppressor and is capable of using either the 5.8√ó21mm DCV05 subsonic pistol cartridge or the 5.8√ó21mm DAP92 pistol cartridge which is also used by the QSZ-92 pistol. While the QCQ-05 does not come with a suppressor, the QCW-05 suppressor can still be affixed and removed from the QCQ-05.

While playing at Michigan, Schulz is credited with having invented the spiral snap and with developing the practice of standing behind the defensive line. As the first lineman to play in back of the line on defense, he is credited as football's first linebacker. During his time at Michigan, Schulz also became involved in one of college football's earliest recruiting controversies, as some suggested that he was a \\"ringer\\" recruited by Michigan coach Fielding H. Yost. Schulz was 21 years old when he enrolled at Michigan and had worked in an Indiana steel mill and reportedly played for either amateur or professional teams. Michigan was refused re-entry into the Western Conference in 1908 when it insisted on playing the 25-year- old Schulz for a fourth season in violation of conference eligibility rules. Despite the controversies, Schulz is remembered both as an innovator and one of the toughest football players in the early days of the game. In 1951, Schulz was selected as the greatest center in football history in a poll conducted by the National Football Foundation and became one of the initial inductees into the College Football Hall of Fame. He has also been inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame and the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor. After his days as a collegiate athlete ended, Schulz assumed a variety of assistant coaching, athletic director, and head coaching positions in college football. He eventually entered the insurance industry, where he enjoyed a long career. He died in 1951, several days after being named the greatest center in football history by the College Football Foundation. Childhood Schulz was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the son of German immigrants. His father, Adolph F. Schulz, Sr., was a doctor who was born in 1854, and his mother, Sophia, was born in 1850. The couple emigrated from Germany to the United States in 1880 with their infant daughter Wilhelmina (born December 1879).Ancestry.com. 1900 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Census Place: Wayne, Allen, Indiana; Roll: T623_358; Page: 18A; Enumeration District: 32. Schulz also had two brothers, Fred Schulz and Arthur Schulz, both of whom became doctors. Schulz played football for Fort Wayne High School and was also a member of amateur city teams for several years. Star athlete at the University of Michigan=Concerns that Schulz was a ringer Michigan Wolverines head football coach, Fielding H. Yost In 1904, Schulz enrolled at the University of Michigan at age 21, standing and weighing . In the early 1900s, many decried the increasing recruitment of ringers-- older, experienced players whose qualifications as \\"student athletes\\" were suspect. Michigan's coach, Fielding H. Yost, whose teams outscored their opponents 2,821 to 42 between 1901 and 1905, had been accused of using ringers before. When Yost accepted the head coaching job at Michigan, he had recruited his star player, 23-year-old Willie Heston, to transfer to Michigan from the California State Normal School. When the 21-year-old Schulz joined the team, there were suggestions that he was Yost's newest ringer. The suspicions were exacerbated by reports that Schulz was a factory worker in an Indiana steel mill who had played for a half-dozen professional teams before enrolling at Michigan. Until the time of his death, reports of his having been a ringer angered Schulz. While he did work in a steel mill, Schulz insisted that he did not \\"come out\\" of the steel mill to play football. Instead, Schulz said he \\"went into\\" the mill to harden himself up for the football season. When asked years later how he got to Michigan, Schulz recalled that, in the summer of 1904, he was working in the mill and had received several offers to play football. One day, his father called to say that Fielding Yost of Michigan was in his office. Schulz ran down the street and rushed into his father's office, where he was introduced to Yost. His father promptly told him, \\"Adolph, this is Mr. Yost. You are to play football for him at Michigan. We have made all the arrangements\\". In September 1904, on his way to Ann Arbor, Michigan (the home of the University of Michigan), Schulz recalled that he stopped in Chicago, Illinois, where he spent four days drinking beer and generally having a \\"swell time\\". A group of Michigan representatives eventually found him in Chicago and put him on the next train to Ann Arbor. When he arrived in Ann Arbor, Yost was furious and accused Schulz of flirting with Amos Alonzo Stagg, the legendary coach of the University of Chicago. Schulz was immediately taken out to Michigan's training camp at Whitmore Lake and kept asking Yost when he was going to be allowed to register. Yost told Schulz that he had taken care of it. According to Schulz, he was registered two weeks before he ever saw the campus. Yost's account differed dramatically from that of Schulz. Sensitive to allegations that he was recruiting ringers, Yost denied having recruited Schulz and claimed that Schulz was just another student who tried out for the team. According to Yost, the first time he ever saw Schulz was in the fall of 1904 when Schulz was waiting tables at a fraternity house in Ann Arbor and told Yost he would like to play football. Yost went so far as to say that he initially thought the young waiter looked too awkward to be a football player, but \\"did not want to discourage anybody\\". Freshman year: Michigan's undefeated season Schulz was the only freshman to play on Michigan's 1904 football team. The team featured the school's all-time scoring leader, Willie Heston, finished with a record of 10‚Äì0, and outscored opponents 567‚Äì22. Schulz started all ten games for the 1904 team. Schulz began his playing career at Michigan as a guard, starting five games at that position. However, midway through the season, Yost moved Schulz to center, where he started the remaining five games. Schulz's play at center was reported to have been \\"gilt- edged\\", and his accuracy in snapping the ball was praised by the team's quarterback, Fred Norcross. Six games into the season, Schulz's hometown newspaper reported on Schulz's accomplishments under the headline: \\"Makes Good at Michigan\\". The article noted: \\"Schulz went to Ann Arbor practically green at the game, but by hard and consistent work he has succeeded in winning a place on the greatest team in America, and is the only freshman out of fifty who was able to do so\\". Schulz was one of the larger football players of his time and was known as a fierce hitter. Schulz liked to tell a story about an incident during Michigan's 1904 game against Oberlin College. He recalled: \\"We were playing Oberlin in 1904. Their regular center was hurt and a little 155-pound fellow came in. I hit him as hard as I could. Imagine my surprise when he looked up and said, 'please sir, if you are determined to be fierce, let me know and I'll get out of the way.' I was no good the rest of the afternoon. Every time I looked at the little fellow, I had to break out laughing\\". 1905 season: Stardom Amos Alonzo Stagg Before the 1905 season got underway, Schulz contracted malaria in the spring. Newspapers reported it was a \\"serious attack\\" and that he \\"has been quite ill\\", but he was able to recuperate before the 1905 football season. In October 1905, Coach Yost said: \\"In looking over the whole bunch, I do not see anyone who has improved more than Schulz. He is bigger and stronger than ever, and I do not know a man in the world that has it the least bit over him in the center position. I would not trade him for any other center rush in the country today. He looks good to me for the All-America team right now\\". Though he was not selected for the All-America team in 1905, Schulz did receive All-Western honors. Innovations: The \\"spiral snap\\" and the \\"roving center\\" Schulz is widely credited with two important innovations in the development of the modern game of American football. First, he is credited with having invented the spiral snap. Before Schulz, centers passed the ball to one of the backs in an end- over-end manner. Second, Schulz is credited with being the first center to step back from the line while playing defense. Prior to Schulz's innovation, centers played in the line on defense. In 1905, Schulz began dropping back from the line, enabling him to use his speed to move laterally and giving him greater coverage across the field of play. At the time, the innovation was referred to as a \\"roving center\\", but it was effectively the birth of the linebacker position in American football. Asked how he developed the \\"roving center\\" idea, Schulz noted that the backs started from five yards behind the line and concluded, \\"No back living could move five yards while I was moving four\\". He described his thinking to Coach Yost this way: \\"It's all very simple, Yost. The ball carrier travels five yards while I travel only four yard to meet him. I know of no back who can beat me in a five-yard race after giving me a one-yard handicap\\". In 1954, sports columnist Dave Lewis explored the history of the linebacker position, and concluded that Schulz was the \\"first of the breed\\". Lewis wrote: \\"Schulz revolutionized defensive line play being the first to back up the line\\". Schulz recalled that the first time he stepped back from the line on defense, Coach Yost was horrified. Yost said, \\"Dutchman, what are you trying to do?\\" \\"Stop 'em\\", replied Schulz. \\"But you're supposed to play in the line\\", Yost insisted. \\"They'll run over us.\\" \\"Listen Yost\\", Schulz claims to have said, \\"My way is best. If any of 'em gets by me, I'll move back into the line and stay there\\". Yost eventually saw the wisdom in Schulz's technique, and soon nearly all centers were backing up the line on defense. Ineligibility for the 1906 season Schulz's promising football career took a detour in 1906. Some sources indicate that Schulz missed the 1906 season for financial reasons. Schulz's official biography at the College Football Hall of Fame states: \\"He missed the 1906 season; he had dropped out of school because of a lack of funds. He worked in a steel mill in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and earned the money to return to college\\". In fact, Schulz's father was a successful doctor, and contemporary reports indicate that Schulz was ineligible to play in 1906 for academic reasons. In February 1906, one paper reported that Schulz had been \\"dropped from the rolls on account of poor work during the semester\\". Another report in March 1906 indicated that Schulz had left the university \\"by desire of the faculty\\" after he fell behind in his studies. In September 1906, The Washington Post reported that Schulz's academic problems continued to render him ineligible to play. All-American in 1907 Schulz depicted on a football card, c. 1955 When Schulz returned to the team in 1907, he was the talk of the campus. One newspaper reported that Ann Arbor had \\"5,000 students continually gossiping about him\\", as Schulz's return was seen as \\"a gigantic stride in the direction of (Michigan's) winning back her former football prestige\\". Coach Yost noted: \\"We need him not only as a player, but also as a leader. In energy, ability to stand hard knocks, and courage he is a model for the rest of the team to strive after\\". With Schulz in the lineup, Michigan won its first five games by a combined score of 107‚Äì0. In Michigan's game against Ohio State, Schulz was reported to have been \\"a brick wall of defense\\" and \\"hard as nails\\". After starting the season 5‚Äì0, Michigan closed the 1907 season playing the University of Pennsylvania. For the first time, one of the eastern schools had agreed to play a game at Ferry Field in Ann Arbor. In the buildup to the game, the press focused on Schulz as the key to Michigan's chances. One writer noted: \\"There is one man in the Michigan eleven that Pennsylvania fears and will endeavor to stop if possible when the two great teams meet in Ann Arbor November 16, 1907. That man is Germany Schulz, Yost's great center\\". Penn even announced that they were moving their star tackle, Draper, to center in an effort to stop Schulz. In the end, Penn beat Michigan, 6‚Äì0, marking the first time the Wolverines had ever lost a game at Ferry Field. Despite the loss, press reports after the game credited Schulz with a great effort. One account noted: \\"Pennsy is said to have delegated three players to watch him, the heavyweight center played a star game throughout. He broke through the line repeatedly and stopped plays. Then again he would dash out to the end and tackle the man attempting to circle the wing. He was down under punts and in the open play showed as much speed as any player on the field. And he weighs 234 pounds\\". At the end of the season, there was a consensus that \\"The giant center of Michigan practically stands in a class by himself at the pivot position\\". University of Chicago star Walter Eckersall, said: \\"Schulz, of Michigan, easily outshone his opponents in every game. He is finely built, runs fast, snaps accurately, tackles hard, and is all over the field in every play\\". One writer referred to Schulz in 1907 as a \\"human catapult\\" and said: \\"Schulz of Michigan is a very heavy man, weighing over 200 pounds, yet he is strikingly fast on his feet and is unusual on that account. He propels his massive frame at a rate of speed that terrifies opponents. . . . The acknowledged prowess of Schulz makes him an especial object of unfair attack in scrimmages by opponents who hope, by disabling him, to weaken the Michigan team\\". Coach Yost added: \\"Schultz is without doubt the best center in the country. In fact, Schulz is the best man in the middle of the line I have ever seen in all my football experience\\". In naming Schulz to his All-America team, Walter Camp said: \\"He is well over six feet in height, yet a fast, powerful man who gets well over the field and makes more tackles in a game than any other man on his team. In addition he is an accurate passer and feeds the ball well to his backs either for kicks or runs\\". Controversy over eligibility for 1908 As the 1907 season ended, a controversy was sparked when the Michigan players unanimously voted Schulz as the captain for the 1908 season. Michigan had been suspended by the Western Conference after the 1906 season, and if it was to seek readmission in 1908, it was required to comply with Western Conference eligibility rules. Under those rules, a player was limited to three years of play, though Michigan's rule allowed a player four years of eligibility. Michigan officials contended that Schulz should not be governed by the rule, because he had begun play before the conference's rule was enacted. Schulz found himself in the middle of football's first eligibility controversy. At the same time, David Starr Jordan, the President of Stanford University, made a speech referring to modern college football as \\"unethical\\", \\"unchristian\\", \\"unsportsmanlike\\" and \\"a monstrosity\\". Starr noted that \\"practically all the major universities employ questionable methods in securing athletes\\". Jordan heaped particular scorn on Michigan, where he claimed \\"the alumni and cheap gamblers of the town brought in men who were professionals and paid them salaries to play on Michigan athlete teams\\". The New York Times ran a front-page story repeating Jordan's charges. The Western Conference's eligibility rules had been at the center of Michigan's dispute with the conference for more than a year. Unlike the Western Conference, the eastern schools had looser eligibility standards, and it was \\"generally conceded that playing under [the Western Conference's] strict eligibility rules Michigan is at a big disadvantage in games with eastern colleges, where, to say the least, the lines are not so clearly drawn\\". Schulz complained amid the controversy about inaccurate reporting of his age. \\"As a rule my age is generally given as twenty-five, when in fact I am but twenty-three.\\" Schulz would have been 24 at the time of his comments. Michigan presented its case for Schulz to a meeting of the \\"Big Nine\\" in Chicago. One account noted: \\"The Michigan case will be discussed at the meeting and it is very likely that a vote requesting the Ann Arbor institution to withdraw from the body will be passed. Michigan's open violation of the conference rules during the last year has aroused a strong hostile spirit, and it is known that a majority of the schools favor dropping the Wolverines from the association\\". Manager Charles Baird was given the task of arguing Schulz's case to the Conference at its January meeting. The student newspaper, The Michigan Daily, urged the school not to abandon Schulz. It wrote: \\"Germany Schulz is now recognized as the captain of Michigan's next football team . . ., and while Michigan students are not averse to going back into active alliance with the western schools, any attempt to debar Schulz from his fairly won honor is sure to cause an uproar, which may upset all of the feeling of compromise which is now evident\\". Ultimately, the Western Conference forced Michigan to choose between Schulz or the conference. Michigan chose Schulz, and the Big Nine remained the Big Eight for the 1908 season. 1908 season and further academic eligibility problems After a strong show of support from the University, Schulz ran into further academic problems. In February 1908, the University announced that Schulz was ineligible for the track team (Schulz competed in the shot put and the discus) due to his performance on a semester exam in hydraulics. While he would be allowed to get his work straightened out before it came time to compete in football, news accounts noted that \\"the outlook is rather gloomy at present\\". By the time football season arrived, Schulz's academic problems had worsened. Contemporary reports indicated that \\"It is not physical conditions which are keeping the giant player from the game (as was announced), but educational ones\\". In early October 1908, Schulz had \\"three conditions in the engineering course, more than a player can carry and continue his athletic relations\\". Though \\"every effort\\" had been made for two weeks to have the conditions removed, those efforts had failed. A meeting of the eligibility board was held, and they concluded that Schulz could not play until he removed at least two of the conditions. While it was possible for Schulz to remove the conditions by the end of October by \\"burning the midnight oil\\", it was reported that \\"this is an optimistic view of the situation shared by few\\". Schulz ultimately had his eligibility restored in late October and was greeted with \\"cheers from the bleachers\\" when he appeared in his first practice on October 22, 1908. It appears that Schulz's academic problems continued, as a 1910 article concerning the post-college success of football players reported that Schulz \\"didn't finish\\" his course at Michigan. 1908 Penn game In 1908, Michigan went into its rivalry game against Penn undefeated. Michigan hoped to avenge two straight defeats to the Quakers, and its hopes were based to a large extent on Schulz. Penn announced before the game that it would bring four available centers so there \\"might be a fresh antagonist facing the Michigan captain throughout the game\\". Special trains from all over Michigan poured large crowds into Ann Arbor, and the crowd was said to be \\"the largest attendance which has been on Ferry Field\\". Though Michigan was beaten that day, 29‚Äì0, Schulz's courageous performance, and the pummeling he took from the Penn team, was recounted many times in the following decades. Not all of these accounts are consistent with each other, but the story of the Penn game has become an integral part of the Germany Schulz hagiography. In one of the few contemporaneous accounts, the Toledo Blade wrote that the Penn players, knowing that Schulz was \\"the power in the Michigan game\\", focused their energy on wearing him down. There were two Penn players who \\"did nothing but look after Schultz\\". And they did more than look: \\"In every scrimmage, he was bumped as hard as the rules allowed, and maybe a little harder, when nobody was looking. ... Every time Schultz started anywhere he would find a couple of Penn men digging headfirst into his stomach. They would elbow him, jam him with the straight arm, and if he went to the ground in a scrimmage there generally would be a knee grinding him in the wind. Pretty soon Schultz began to show it. ... He limped along pitifully. He couldn't run. His strength was almost gone. When he did tackle, his groan of pain could almost be heard in the stands\\". But the fans continued to urge Schulz with yells of \\"G-r-r-r-r- rah, Schultz!\\" Schulz buckled down and continued to play, and the pummeling continued. At half-time, the trainers found on Schulz \\"a mass of black and blue spots\\". His \\"face was distorted with bumps\\", and there were \\"welts on his back and groin\\". As the second half started, Schulz insisted he felt better and went back into the game. But the attack continued. \\"Another scrimmage and two more Penn men were after him again. He went into the play and for an instant, his strength came back, but it couldn't last, and it didn't.\\" Yost finally sent in a substitute, and Schulz limped to the sideline and walked slowly away \\"with head bowed and hands to his stomach\\". And when the \\"rubbers\\" removed his togs and examined him, \\"they marveled that he was able to walk\\". In the end, Schulz \\"didn't say a word--big tears rolled down as he lay there; Schultz was thoroughly beaten, but it took the entire Pennsylvania eleven to do it\\". Penn's captain, Bill Hollenback, said: \\"This fellow Schulz is a monster in size and a perfect athlete. He is both wonderfully agile and fast for a man of his size. In our game with Michigan, we had two men instructed to play against Schulz and at times three and four were opposed to him. For some time, he handed out as much as we passed to him in the roughing end of the game. He was here, there and everywhere. He did most of the tackling. He broke up innumerable plays. He was the star of the contest until the continued battering of our men injured him to such an extent that he had to retire. The rest was easy\\". Coach Yost said of Schulz's performance: \\"He gave the greatest one-man exhibition of courage I ever saw on a football field\\". From the 1920s through the 1950s, the story was told, re-told and likely embellished in columns by Grantland Rice, Art Carlson, Frank Blair and Dave Lewis--more than one of them writing that they had seen the game in person. In Carlson's 1925 account, \\"the giant center had been rendered practically useless from the Penn attack\\", but refused to leave the game. Carlson recalled Schulz's removal from the game this way: \\"It was a scene I shall never forget--the giant Schulz, towering above the rest of the combatants, literally dragged off the field, tears streaming down his mud-spattered cheeks as he frantically protested his removal from the game\\". In 1942, Grantland Rice wrote that Schulz held the Penn team in check for 50 minutes and that the score was 0‚Äì0 when Schulz \\"left the field a battered wreck\\". (In fact, contemporaneous accounts show the score was 6‚Äì0 at halftime.) In Frank Blair's 1951 telling, Schulz played with the \\"strength of Samson\\", and Penn \\"put five men -- center, both guards and both tackles--on the Wolverine giant\\". According to Blair, who claimed to have attended the game as a high school student, Schulz played like a madman, making nearly all the tackles for 50 minutes, and Penn was held scoreless until Schulz was \\"carried from the field\\". In a 1954 article, sports writer Dave Lewis wrote that Penn assigned five players to the task of mowing down Schulz. Lewis quoted Schulz as having said: \\"I can still see those five pairs of eyes staring at me every time we lined up . . . ready to tear me apart\\". According to Lewis, all five men piled on Schulz every play, and Schulz held Penn scoreless for 50 minutes before they \\"finally knocked him out\\". Lewis concluded: \\"Never before or since has there been such a one-man show of defensive football as Schulz displayed against Penn\\". A few months before his death, Schulz told Detroit News sports writer H. G. Salsinger that he had only one regret: \\"I wish I could have lasted 10 minutes longer. That was one game I wanted to finish\\". Awards and accolades In January 1910, Walter Camp published his All-Time All-American list in Century magazine, selecting the best player at each position over the 20 years he had been watching college football. He selected Schulz as his center, the first of many such All-Time All-American selections for Schulz. At the time, Camp said: \\"Big, strong and fast, he combined all the defensive and offensive qualities of the best line men with the speed, sure tackling and intuition as to what to do on the instant that are winning qualities of the defensive back. In addition, his passing was excellent, as he had plenty of speed for his kicker, steadiness for his quarter, and ability to pass in directions other than in a straight line which made him especially valuable in certain formation plays\\". In 1949, Grantland Rice chose him as the center for his All-Time All-American team. At the time, Rice said: \\"Schulz was 6 feet 4 and he weighed 245 pounds. He was as fast as a good halfback. I have never seen a center who was his equal at backing up a line and then protecting both flanks. He was a terrific tackler\\". In 1951, the College Football Foundation commissioned the Associated Press to conduct a poll of more than 100 sports editors to choose an All-Time All- American team. Those chosen would be the initial inductees into the new College Football Hall of Fame. Schulz won the great majority of the votes at center and thus became one of the initial inductees into the College Football Hall of Fame. In announcing the selection, the Associated Press said: \\"Schulz was a giant of a man--six feet five and 285 pounds--with tremendous ham-like hands that worked to his advantage in that era of mass formations when ground was gained on brute strength alone\\". On being told of his selection, Schulz, who died ten days later, said he was honored and noted: \\"I haven't missed one of those teams yet\\". He was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1960. He was also posthumously inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1979. In 2004, he was selected as one of the top fifteen football players in U-M history in 2004 by The Michigan Daily. Professional football in the Tri-State league In 1909 and 1910, Schulz played briefly in the infant Tri-State professional football league operating in Ohio, Illinois and Pennsylvania. He played for the Dayton Oakwoods team. His first game with the Oakwoods was on Thanksgiving 1909. In that game, the Oakwoods defeated the Pittsburgh Lyceum, which had gone undefeated for three seasons and was considered the top professional team of its era. At the time of the 1910 United States Census, Schulz was listed as residing with his parents in Fort Wayne, and his occupation was listed as being an engineer with an electric works.Ancestry.com. 1910 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Census Place: Fort Wayne Ward 4, Allen, Indiana; Roll: T624_339; Page: 15B; Enumeration District: 0042; Image: 385; FHL Number: 1374352. The Oakwoods made Schulz an offer to return in 1910 as the team's captain, but contemporaneous press accounts indicate he was weighing the remuneration to be paid by the Oakwoods against his steady job at the Fort Wayne Electric works. Though some accounts indicate that he ultimately accepted the Oakwoods' offer, official records of play have not been located to determine whether Schulz actually played for the Oakwoods in 1910. In December 1910, Schulz did play on an all-star team against the All-Harvard club in a game in Memphis, Tennessee, for the benefit of the United Charities association. College football coach and athletic director=University of Wisconsin In 1911 and 1912, Schulz worked as the line coach for the University of Wisconsin. After two years, he resigned to accept the management of an automobile concern in Fort Wayne. University of Michigan Schulz returned to coaching in 1913 as the line coach and chief assistant coach for Fielding H. Yost at Michigan. He held that position for three seasons from 1913‚Äì1915. While working as an assistant coach at Michigan, Schulz has been credited with introducing the technique of overshifting a lineman on defense. In 1913, Schulz developed a new blocking technique by shifting one of the linemen. Coach Yost was unconvinced until Schulz performed a demonstration using Michigan's left guard Royce Traphagen. Schulz first put Traphagen in the line position designated by Yost, Schulz lined up on the other side of the line and charged, \\"almost wrecking Traphagen\\". Then, Schulz had the groggy Traphagen line up in the spot designated by Schulz, and when Schulz charged he missed. Schulz implemented the overshift technique during the 1913 season. In late November 1915, Schulz's mother, Sophia Schulz, died at age 65. Two days after her death, Schulz announced that he was withdrawing from the Michigan coaching staff, though it was noted at the time that several Midwestern universities were working to get Schulz as their head coach. In January 1916, the Fort Wayne Sentinel reported that Schulz was back to work at his old position in the general testing room at the Fort Wayne Electric works, after an absence of two years. Kansas State In September 1916, Schulz returned to coaching as the assistant athletic director at Kansas State Agricultural College, now known as Kansas State University. Schulz spent four years in Manhattan, Kansas, working as an assistant under head coach Zora G. Clevenger. When Kansas State beat Southwestern 53‚Äì0, the Fort Wayne paper ran a story: \\"Germany's Team Wins.\\" During the first three years under Schulz and Clevenger, the Wildcats went 16‚Äì4‚Äì1 and outscored their opponents 464‚Äì90. However, in 1919, Kansas State gave up 109 points (more than in the three prior seasons combined) and finished with a 3‚Äì5‚Äì1. Schulz announced his resignation in January 1920. In a draft registration card completed in September 1918, Schulz identified his occupation as an athletic coach for the Kansas Agricultural College at Manhattan, Kansas.Draft Registration Card for Adolph George Schulz, born April 19, 1883. Ancestry.com. World War I Draft Registration Cards, 1917-1918 [database on-line]. Registration Location: Allen County, Indiana; Roll: 1503884; Draft Board: 2. During World War I, Schulz also served as the athletic director at Fort Riley in Kansas. He was assigned to direct athletic exercises for the men serving at the camp. At the time of the 1920 United States Census, Schulz was listed as an athletic coach living in Manhattan, Kansas.Ancestry.com. 1920 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Census Place: Manhattan Ward 2, Riley, Kansas; Roll: T625_545; Page: 4A; Enumeration District: 126; Image: 865. Tulane University In August 1920, Schulz was hired by Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana, as the director of the school's new \\"department of physical education\\". Reporters took note of Schulz's size when he arrived in New Orleans: \\"It is a fortunate thing for all concerned that Schulz has taken up the more peaceful pursuit of physical director. It is a stroke of good fortune for Tulane and her athletes that the athletic council was able to land a big man like Schulz\\". Though he served as the school's athletic director, Schulz also chose to take charge of the linemen during football season, working alongside football coach Clark Shaughnessy. In 1920, Schulz arranged for the Tulane football team to play Michigan as part of the most extensive trip made to that point by a southern football team. Schulz's team faced off against Coach Yost and the Wolverines on October 30, 1920, and were shut out, 21‚Äì0. University of Detroit In December 1922, Schulz was hired as head football coach at the University of Detroit. Shortly after his appointment, Schulz announced that he was looking for \\"eleven raving maniacs\\" to fill out his team, a phrase that was picked up in wire service reports around the country. He noted: \\"You can't beat eleven raving maniacs with football heads\\". In September 1923, the press reported that Schulz suffered a shoulder injury while demonstrating proper tackling technique on a tackling \\"dummy\\". After going 39‚Äì7 in the five seasons before Schulz took over, the Detroit team fell to 4‚Äì3‚Äì2 in 1923. In January 1924, the University announced that it would not renew Schulz's contract, and Schulz announced his \\"permanent retirement from football coaching\\". Later life Schulz worked in the insurance business, including as a state agent for an insurance company in Michigan, from 1924 until his death in 1951. After retiring from football in the early 1920s, Schulz led a private life, and little has been written about the last 30 years of his life. At the time of the 1930 United States Census, Schulz was living in Grand Rapids, Michigan, with his wife, Emilie V. Schulz (age 35), his mother-in-law, Emilie V. Sabovian (age 82), and his sister-in-law, Louise Sabovian. His occupation was listed in the 1930 Census as an insurance salesman.Ancestry.com. 1930 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Census Place: Grand Rapids, Kent, Michigan; Roll: 1002; Page: 1B; Enumeration District: 57; Image: 156.0. Schulz died in 1951, less than two weeks after being selected as the center on the All-Time All-American Team. Schulz had undergone an operation for a \\"malignant ulcer of the stomach\\" in February 1951 and suffered a relapse in April. He died at Detroit's Henry Ford Hospital at age 67.

They lived along the shores of the Western Interior Seaway, but it is not clear whether they were seabirds or freshwater birds, as the genus is only known from a humerus. Consequently, the genus contains only one known species, Torotix clemensi. T. clemensi is represented by a single fossil specimen, a partial humerus (upper arm bone) recovered from the Lance formation of Wyoming. Its deposits are dated to the very end of the Cretaceous period, 66 million years ago. Classification Torotix was first described by Brodkorb in 1963, who initially suggested that it was related to modern flamingos, in the order Phoenicopteriformes.Brodkorb (1963). \\"Birds from the Upper Cretaceous of Wyoming.\\" pp. 50‚Äì70 in Sibley (ed.), Proceedings of the XIII International Ornithological Congress. Later researchers thought it was more likely to have been related to the Charadriiformes (waders/shorebirds).Olson, S. (1985). \\"The fossil record of birds.\\" pp. 79‚Äì239 in Farner, King and Parkes (eds.), Avian Biology vol VIII. New York: Academic Press. More recent comparative studies have found it to be most similar to Pelecaniformes.Hope, S. (2002). \\"The Mesozoic radiation of Neornithes.\\" pp. 339‚Äì388 in Chiappe, L. and Witmer, L.M. (eds), Mesozoic Birds: Above the Heads of Dinosaurs. Berkeley: University of California Press. A cladistic study of the wing bone found Torotix not to resemble that of the waved albatross (a procellariiform), northern gannet (a \\"pelecaniform\\" of the suborder Suli), painted buttonquail (an ancient charadriiform), black-necked stilt (a more advanced charadriiform) or a Phoenicopterus flamingo noticeably more than any other. However, this comparison provided information only about ecological rather than phylogenetic similarities. The family Torotigidae was initially established to unite this genus with Parascaniornis and Gallornis. However, the former is now considered a junior synonym of Baptornis (a hesperornithine), while the latter may be a very early fowl of the group Galloanserae.

Shipping accidents are a threat to the maritime environment and to human life in the highly populated areas around the straits. These two straits are among the busiest and most critical seaways in the world, and because of the Bosphorus's status as the narrowest strait used for international navigation, maritime disasters have been common. Bosphorus The Bosphorus is a narrow \\"S-shaped\\" channel of complex nature with several sharp turns and headlands, which prevent a proper look-out, and with changing currents. Such geographical and oceanographic conditions make the navigation, open to international shipping, very difficult and risky. The density of maritime traffic in the Bosphorus, which links the Black Sea to the Marmara Sea, has increased elevenfold from around 4,400 ships passing annually in 1936, when the Montreux Convention was signed to regulate transit and navigation in the Straits, to an average of 48,000 vessels per year recently. With 132 vessel transits daily, not including local traffic, it ranks second to the Malacca Straits in density. During the period from 1953 to 2002, 461 maritime incidents occurred in the Istanbul Strait or in its southern entrance at the Marmara Sea.

He appeared in more than 220 films between 1920 and 1943, mostly in small supporting roles. Biography Charters was born in Duncannon, Pennsylvania. Until around 1890 he worked as a machinist for the Chesapeake Nail Works in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and had little interest in acting. He soon appeared on stage after leaving school with a walk-on part, but it wasn't long before he was being given fair-sized roles. He played on Broadway between 1910 and 1929 and was a busy character actor in films during the 1930s and early 1940s. He often portrayed somewhat befuddled judges, doctors, clerks, managers, and jailers. Charters was married to actress Irene Myers until her death December 22, 1941. He died by suicide from a mix of sleeping pills and carbon monoxide poisoning.

After the Mexican War of Independence it was renamed University of Mexico. When Mexican liberals were in power at intervals in the nineteenth century, it was closed, since liberals sought to put education in the hands of the state rather than the Roman Catholic Church. Its first closure was in 1833, when Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as implemented liberal policies. When Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna returned to power, the university was reopened. It was finally abolished in 1865 during the Second Mexican Empire by Maximilian I of Mexico. Scattered institutions, including secularized successors of its faculties of law and medicine, other secular colleges founded by liberals on the model of the French grandes ecoles, and religious establishments outside Mexico City, continued without interruption. In 1910, during the regime of Porfirio D√≠az, Justo Sierra merged and expanded Mexico City's decentralized colleges of higher education, founding the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). UNAM is a public university and considered the institutional heir of the earlier original University of Mexico, but under state rather than church control. Organization The university was organized by five faculties: Theology, Laws, Fees, Medicine, and Arts. The principal subjects or chairs (in Spanish, c√°tedras) were Prima and V√≠speras, due to the initial class being in the morning and the second in the evening.

History The Army Air Forces constituted the 25th Weather Squadron on October 28, 1943. The squadron activated at Patterson Field, Ohio, and was assigned to the Army Air Forces Weather Wing four days later. The 25th moved to Lynbrook, Long Island, New York, on November 4, 1943, and was disbanded on September 7, 1944. The U.S. Air Force reconstituted the 25th Weather Squadron on May 18, 1948, and activated it at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia. The squadron was assigned to the 104th Weather Group, later the 2104th Air Weather Group on June 1, 1948. It was reassigned to the 2059th Air Weather Wing on October 24, 1950. The 25th moved to Donaldson Air Force Base, South Carolina, on September 10, 1951. The squadron was assigned to the 2102nd Air Weather Group on September 16, 1951. The 25th was reassigned to the 2nd Weather Group on April 20, 1952. In 1953 in addition to operating the Troop Carrier Weather Center at Donaldson Air Force Base, the 25th was designated to test and develop doctrine for the provision of weather service for airborne forces and determine the requirements of and procedures for providing their service in cold weather operations. To validate its cold weather concepts the squadron participated in joint training activities such as Exercise SNOW STORM in upstate New York during the winter of 1953. The 25th moved to Waco, Texas, and began its association with the Twelfth Air Force on September 18, 1957. In addition to providing meteorological services to Twelfth Air Force bases, the 25th supported U.S. Strike Command exercises, contingencies, and special missions. The squadron was assigned to the 5th Weather Wing when the wing was activated on October 8, 1965. The 25th Weather Squadron moved to Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas, on May 23, 1968, concurrent with the move of Headquarters, Twelfth Air Force from Waco to Bergstrom Air Force Base. Air Weather Service inactivated the 25th Weather Squadron on 30 June 1972 as an Air Force budgetary reduction caused Air Weather Service to reduce squadron overhead. A Staff Weather Officer cell was established in its place to support Twelfth Air Force. This was short-lived as Air Weather Service again activated the squadron at Bergstrom Air Force Base and again assigned it to the 5th Weather Wing on January 1, 1975. In June 1975 Lt Col George E. Chapman, who was later promoted to brigadier general and served as commander of Air Weather Service from 1982 to 1988, took command of the 25th. In addition to numerous annual exercises, the 25th supported contingencies such as Operation JUST CAUSE in 1989. The 25th was inactivated on 30 September 1991, as part of the divestiture of Air Weather Service. The squadron was redesignated the 25th Operational Weather Squadron on February 5, 1999, and activated at Davis- Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, on 1 April 1999. It was assigned to the 612th Air Operations Group, renewing its association with Twelfth Air Force, which moved its headquarters to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in 1993.

Biography  Franz Mayer arrived in Mexico in 1905. He moved into the financial world at the age of 23 and by around 1908 he had already enrolled as an agent of an independent stock exchange, thus beginning a promising career. During the Mexican Revolution, he left the country and went to the United States, where he lived for two years, returning to Mexico in 1913. In 1920, he married Maria Antonieta de la Macorra but became a widower a few years later, having had no children. He became a Mexican citizen on 29 December 1933. From the 1950s, Mayer had conceived the idea of donating his collection of fine and decorative arts to Mexico. Finally in 1963 he set up a trust fund, and the Bank of Mexico was chosen as the fiduciary for the establishment of an art museum in Mexico City. At the same time a sponsor was found among the people closest to him. According to the wishes of Franz Mayer, the contract established that the trusteeship would create a library, organize exhibitions, competitions and conferences. Mayer died in 1975 and donated his collection to the state and people of Mexico. The museum carrying his name was opened in 1986 in the former flour-weighing building and hospital, specially renovated in order to house this collection.

The Clan Mackay and possibly the Clan Sutherland defeated the Clan Ross and their allies in the Scottish Highlands, probably on the south side of Strathoykel. Background Just one year before Angus Mackay of Strathnaver, chief of the Clan Mackay had been killed and defeated at the Battle of Tarbat by Alexander Ross of Balnagowan, chief of the Clan Ross. Angus Mackay's son John Mackay returned a year later to attack the Rosses in revenge for the death of his father. According to 17th-century historian Sir Robert Gordon, who was a younger son of Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, the Clan Sutherland joined the side of the Clan Mackay at this battle. However, 19th-century historian Angus Mackay disputes the Sutherland's presence at the battle stating that it would be unlikely that the Earl of Sutherland at the time would have assisted against the Rosses as he was married to a daughter of the Ross chief of Balnagowan, and also that the feudal superiority of the Sutherlands over the Mackays \\"nowhere existed save in his own fertile imagination\\". Location and date Most sources follow Gordon in giving the date of the battle as 11 July 1487. The Calendar of Fearn puts it in June 1486. Mackay dates the Battle of Tarbat to 1475 and \\"Allta-charrish\\" to 1478 or \\"a few years after\\". The location of the battle remains elusive.. Has a reasonable overview of possible locations. Most sources say that it took place in Strathoykel or Strathcarron. Whilst some interpret the latter as the River Carron in Wester Ross, it is more likely to be the Carron in Sutherland, that lies immediately south of the Oykel. Mackinnon's map locates it on the banks of the lower Carron, between Braelangwell and Invercharron. Account is largely based on that of Sir Robert Gordon of Gordonstoun - now available on CD () The most probable location is the Allt a'Charraigh (), a burn between Braelangwell and Rosehall that flows into the Kilmachalmack Burn on the Strathoykel side of Meall Dheirgidh. Accounts of the Battle=Conflicts of the Clans An account of the battle was written in the book Conflicts of the Clans published by the Foulis press in 1764, written from a manuscript wrote in the reign of James VI of Scotland: > The year of God 1487, this conflict was fought; upon this occasion Angus > Mackay being slain at Tarbat by the surname of Ross, as I have shown > already, John Riabhach Mackay (the son of this Angus), came to the Earl of > Sutherland, upon whom he then depended, and desired his aid to revenge his > father's death, whereupon the Earl of Sutherland yields, and sent his uncle, > Robert Sutherland, with a company of men, to assist him. Thereupon Robert > Sutherland and John Riabhach Mackay did invade Strathoyckel and Strathcarron > with fire and sword; burnt, spoiled, and laid waste divers lands > appertaining to the Rosses. The Laird of Balnagown (then chief of the Rosses > in that shire) learning of his invasion, gathered all the forces of Ross and > met Robert Sutherland and John Riabhach at a place called Aldicharrish. > There ensued a cruel and furious conflict combat, which continued a long > time, with incredible obstinacy; much blood was shed on either side. In the > end, the inhabitants of Ross being unable to endure or resist the enemies' > forces were utterly disbanded and put to flight. Alexander Ross, Laird of > Balnagown, was slain with seventeen other landed gentlemen of the province > of Ross, besides a great number of common soldiers. The manuscript of Fearn > (by and attour Balnagown) names these following among those that were slain: > Mr. William Ross, Angus Macculloch of Terrell, John Waus, William Waus, John > Mitchell, Thomas Waus, Houcheon Waus. Robert Mackay Robert Mackay wrote an account of the battle in his book the \\"History of the House and Clan of the Name Mackay\\" (1829), quoting from the historian Sir Robert Gordon (1580 - 1656): > John Mackay, some time after he had succeeded to his father's lands, > resolved to revenge his death; for which purpose, having assembled his men, > and put half of them under command of William-Dow Mackay, son of John- > Abrach; and being also accompanied by the men of Assint, and such friends as > he had in Sutherland, he invaded Strathoikel in Ross with fire and sword, > burnt, wasted and spoiled all the lands belongingto all of the name Ross and > their allies. Ross of Balnagown immediately raised all of the power of the > county to oppose the invaders, upon which a most severe conflict ensued, and > for a considerable time it appeared doubtful which party would have the > victory. At length, however, the Ross-men, after great slaughter was made > among them, gave way, and fled. Ross of Balnagown, and seventeen other > proprietors of land in Ross were slain, together with an immense number of > their followers. \\"The manuscript of Fern\\" says Sir Robert Gordon \\"contains > the following names of the principle persons who were killed, Alexander > Tarrell, William Ross, John Waus, William Waus, John Mitchell, Thomas Waus, > and Hugh Waus. A great spoil of cattle was driven off, and divided among the > victors in the customary manner. Sir Robert states that the Assint-men > insisted that the men of Sutherland should receive no share of the spoil, > but that William-Dow, who detected such injustice, said, that he should be > an enemy to any who would act such a fraudulent and base part. This conflict > happened at a place called Auldicharish. Donald MacKinnon Donald MacKinnon wrote an account in his book \\"The Clan Ross\\" (1957), again quoting from the historian Sir Robert Gordon (1580 ‚Äì 1656): > The Mackays did not forget this wicked deed, and five years later invaded > Ross to avenge the death of their chief. Alexander Ross of Balnagown > hurriedly called together the ‚Äúgentlemen‚Äù of his clan and their men, and met > the invaders at a place called Alt a‚ÄôCharrais in Strathcarron. There a > fierce battle was fought, and the Rosses were disastrously defeated. Sir > Robert Gordon, alluding to this sanguinary fight says: ‚ÄúMuch blood was > shed‚Ä¶. The inhabitants of Ross, being unable to endure the enemy‚Äôs forces, > were disbanded and put to flight. Alexander Ross, laird of Balnagown, was > there slain, with seventeen other landed gentlemen of the Province of Ross, > besides a great number of common soldiers‚Äù. Among the ‚Äúgentlemen of the > Province of Ross‚Äù, who fell along with their chief, were Angus MacCulloch of > Tarell, Alexander Tarell, William Ross of Little Allan, John Vass, Thomas > Vass, Hugh Vass, John Mitchell and William Ross, whose designation is not > given.‚Äô‚Äô Aftermath In 1490 James IV of Scotland granted to David Ross, nephew and heir of John Ross, and grandson of John Ross of Balnagown, the lands of Strathoikel and Strathcarron, which had formerly belonged to Morgan Neilson Mackay,Mackay, Angus (1906). pp. 69-78 who along with his brother Neil Neilson Mackay, had attempted in 1433 to take over the lands of Strathnaver from their cousin, Angus Du Mackay, 7th of Strathnaver, but had been defeated and killed at the Battle of Drumnacoub by Angus's forces. Although John Rivach Mackay received a remission from the king in 1494, the blood feud with the Rosses appears to have continued as David Ross of Balnagown and Iye Roy Mackay of Strathnaver were summoned to appear before the Earl of Argyll who was the Lord High Chancellor of Scotland. On 4 October 1496, each of them were bound by extending their hand to Argyll in the king‚Äôs name to keep the peace towards each other and that their \\"folks sal be harmless and skaithles\\", under the penalty of 500 merks if they failed. Notwithstanding the apparent reconciliation, David Ross of Balnagown and his brother Hucheon Ross, brought an action to the Lords of Council against the Mackays for spoils taken from their lands eight years earlier. On 15 March 1504, Iye Roy Mackay, 10th of Strathnaver secured from the king the lands of Ferencostrig, Strathhalladale, Creichmore, Assent, Coigach, Gruids, and Strathfleet. On 15 February, 1506, Iye Roy Mackay caused the charter that had been granted by Donald of Islay, Lord of the Isles in 1415 to the Mackays who laid claim to these lands. However, the Lords of Council decided that the lands had belonged to Euphemia II, Countess of Ross. The Mackays continued to raid the Rosses well into the 16th century and did not stop until they became caught up in quarrels with their neighbours, the powerful Clan Sutherland.

Causer had stolen over A$20 million during the period November 2007 to June 2009 and used the money to purchase 43 properties and 3 cars.

The Federal Chancellery of Switzerland publishes translations in German, French, Italian, Romansh and English. Preamble and beginning of the title 1 of the German edition of the Swiss Federal Constitution. The preamble and the first title of the Swiss Federal Constitution of 18 April 1999 determine the general outlines of Switzerland as a democratic federal republic of 26 cantons governed by the rule of law. Preamble The preamble to the Constitution states, in full:Official English Translation on www.admin.ch By opening with a solemn invocation of God, the preamble is in line with all preceding Swiss constitutional documents, back to the Federal Charter of 1291, except for the constitutions adopted under French sway in the time of the Helvetic Republic.Bernhard Ehrenzeller in Ehrenzeller, Preamble, N 14. Apart from continuing tradition, the invocatio dei is understood to be a reference to transcendental values underlying society, putting into perspective any claims to authority by the State ‚Äì a merely human creation.Ibid, at N 17. The preamble was authored by journalist Daniel S. Mi√©ville, and inspired in part by a 1977 draft by writer Adolf Muschg.Ibid, at N 2. It is a symbolic summation of the will to and purpose of statehood,Ibid, at N 1 and 7. a declaration of intent by the popular Sovereign,Ibid, at N 6. an integrating avowal of the Swiss people's fundamental values,Ibid, at N 8. and a binding mandate to the State's authorities.Ibid, at N 9 et seq. The extent to which the preamble is legally binding is contested; it is certainly not judiciable. It was among the most contested provisions in the course of the 1999 constitutional revision.Ibid, at N 2. Title 1: General Provisions The general provisions (articles 1‚Äì6) define the characteristic traits of the Swiss state on all of its three levels of authority: federal, cantonal and municipal. They are addressed to the state authorities, programmatic in scope and not directly enforceable.Bernhard Ehrenzeller in Ehrenzeller, Preliminaries to Art. 1‚Äì6, N 2. Notably, provisions about the symbols of the state such as the flag or anthem are left out.Ibid, at N 3. Article 1 constitutes the federal state, the Confederation, as consisting of the people and the 26 co√´qual cantons listed in their traditional order of precedence. Article 2 enumerates the purposes of the state, which include protecting the liberty and the rights of the people, and ensuring the independence and security of the country. Like the preamble, this provision is of symbolic, historical, political and normative value.Felix Hafner / Rainer J. Schweizer in Ehrenzeller, Art. 2 N 4. Article 3 provides that \\"the Cantons are sovereign insofar as their sovereignty is not limited by the Federal Constitution; they shall exercise all rights which are not transferred to the Confederation.\\" This maintains the \\"bottom-up\\" Swiss constitutional tradition according to which both the whole Confederation and the cantons are states in their own right.Ibid, Art. 1 N 13; Art. 3 N 7. Notably, the same holds true in the United States. Much like U.S. states, the cantons are autonomous in their organisation and in their actions as states, although in principle the Confederation alone is a subject of international law.Ibid. As in the U.S., the powers delegated by the cantons to the Confederation are enumerated in the Constitution, although in practice federal authority is construed and exercised extensively.Rainer J. Schweizer in Ehrenzeller, Art. 3 N 10. Also, federal and cantonal competencies often overlap and interlock in complex ways.Ibid, N 15 et seq. Article 4 declares German, French, Italian and Romansh to be the \\"national languages\\", highlighting the prominence of Swiss multilingualism as an integral part of the country's self-conception.Regula K√§gi-Diener in Ehrenzeller, Art. 4 N 5. Article 5 lists some of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law which the state is bound to observe, including the principles of obedience to law, proportionality, good faith and, due to pacta sunt servanda, respect for international law. The latter is customarily held to be self-executing and thus directly enforceable in Switzerland, with important exceptions.Yvo Hangartner in Ehrenzeller, Art. 5 N 41. Article 6, another preamble-like provision indicative of the Swiss' perception of themselves,Peter H√§berle in Ehrenzeller, Art. 6 N 4. counterbalances the \\"social goals\\" set forth in article 41 by stating that \\"all persons are responsible for themselves\\".

Biography Pennick was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of gold miner Albert R. and Bessie (Murray) Pennick. He and his first wife, Grechin, had two children by the time he was twenty. He had a third child with his second wife, Nona Lorraine. Pennick joined the United States Marine Corps and serving in China and World War I. In the 1920s he worked as a horse wrangler on various film productions before he was noticed by filmmaker John Ford. He soon began working as an actor, as well as a military technical adviser. He reenlisted in the United States Navy in September 1941, at the age of 45.Muster Rolls of U.S. Navy Ships, Stations, and Other Naval Activities, January 1, 1939 ‚Äì January 1, 1949; Record Group: 24, Records of the Bureau of Naval Personnel, 1798 - 2007; Series ARC ID: 594996; Series MLR Number: A1 135.

It is currently located in the A.K. Bell Library, Perth, Scotland. Little is known of William Dixon's biography, except what has been learned from this manuscript, and from parish records in Northumberland.  The man  The only direct evidence for the author's identity comes from the manuscript itself, giving his name and two others, Parcival and John, who may have been his sons. It also gives dates from 1733 to 1738. Many of the tunes in the manuscript were, and some remain, current in Northumberland, or are named after places in the region. Baptismal records for that county show that a William Dixson was christened in Stamfordham, Northumberland, in 1678, and that Parsivall and John, sons of William Dixson, were baptised nearby at Fenwick, near Stamfordham, in 1708 and 1710. Julia Say has found that these belonged to a branch of the Dixon family living at Ingoe South Hall, near Fenwick, where some of the family lived until recently. The tracing of this family is made easier by their tradition of using the names William and Parcival in many generations, especially as Parcival is so rare; on the other hand, the shared names make identification of individuals harder. Many of the family were buried in Stamfordham church where there is a fine memorial to them. It is recorded that Parcival was apprenticed as a scrivener; this suggests that some of the inscriptions in the book, in an ornate hand, but different styles, are his work. However it is clear from these that the book is William's - for example one reads 'William Dixon His Book May ye 10th 1733'. If this William Dixon was indeed the author of the manuscript, he would have been 55 when he started compiling it, and 60 when he ceased. One son of colliery owner John Dixon, another William (1788-1859),founded an important iron business with five blast furnaces in central Scotland later in the century, which was further developed by his son. 'Dixon's Blazes' survived as a business in Glasgow until 1958, and still has a placename there. Julia Say has conjectured that this is how the manuscript reached Scotland.  The manuscript  Nothing is definitely known of the whereabouts of the manuscript in the 18th and 19th centuries. At the beginning of the 20th century, however, it was in the collection of the composer and cellist Charles Macintosh, of Inver, Perthshire. His grandfather had been a pupil of Niel Gow, who lived in the same village. In 1909, he offered it to the music collector, Dorothea Ruggles-Brise, reportedly saying \\"I have an old torn book upstairs; it is of no use to anyone; you may have it if you like\\". She replied \\"This is a curiosity, I would rather not rob you. Will you let me buy it?\\". Offended, he answered \\"In that case, I will put it in the fire.\\" She pulled it out, before it was damaged. She correctly recognised the music as \\"a collection of pipe jigs of the border country\\".The Master Piper, 3rd edition, Matt Seattle, Dragonfly Music, 2011, . This book, and the other music books in her personal collection, known as the Atholl Collection, were bequeathed to Perth Public Library on her death in 1938. The manuscript was more definitively identified as pipe music from south of the border by the piper and fiddler Matt Seattle in 1995; previously it had been considered by some David Johnson, Scottish Fiddle Music in the 18th Century, Mercat Press, Edinburgh, . as fiddle music, albeit rather odd. He was able to publish a transcription that same year, with extensive notes, as The Master Piper; 16 minutes in this has recently been reissued in a third edition. It was transposed up a tone from the source, to suit modern Border pipes, which are generally notated in A. The importance of the manuscript as a musical source, apart from its antiquity, is the almost unique nature of the music. Almost all of the 40 pieces in the manuscript are long variation sets on dance tunes ‚Äì one, Dorrington, running to 14 strains. Much of the figuration is similar to early Northumbrian smallpipe music, but the compass of many of the tunes is 9 notes, from F to g, with no sharps or flats, rather than the single octave of the unkeyed Northumbrian smallpipes of the time. It thus seems that the music was written either for smallpipes with an open ended chanter, like Scottish smallpipes, or else for what are now known as Border pipes. Both of those instruments had largely died out by the mid-19th century, and their repertoire had survived only in fragments, mostly in adaptations for other instruments, such as fiddle, Northumbrian Smallpipes, or lute.  The music  In this manuscript was found a large body of music, of considerable sophistication, readily playable on either Scottish Smallpipes or Border Pipes. The musical style is very different from Highland pipe music, despite the many common features of the instruments. In particular, there is no explicitly prescribed ornamentation anywhere, only an occasional direction to ornament certain notes. In contrast, Highland pipe music usually specifies complex patterns of grace notes in detail. Further, the Dixon music tends to avoid repeated notes, and to move predominantly stepwise or in thirds rather than in wider intervals. The tunes form a substantial and varied repertoire. Some of them are known in other versions in the Northumbrian and the Lowland Scottish traditions ‚Äì but some of the tunes are not known elsewhere, and all the Dixon versions are distinct from their known parallels. Besides one short minuet, and one song-tune with a pair of variations, there is a selection of dance-music in different rhythms. These include * 13 reels, rants or common- time hornpipes, in 4/4 or 2/2, * 10 jigs, in 6/4, * 6 triple time hornpipes, in 3/2, * 9 tunes in compound triple time, 'slip jigs', in 9/4. The time signatures are not given explicitly, but can be deduced from the melodic patterns and bar-lengths. In the manuscript most of the triple-time hornpipes and some slip-jigs are misnotated, with bar lengths of respectively of 4 or 6 crotchets, when 6 or 9 would follow the melodic patterns. The time signatures have been corrected to 3/2 and 9/4 in the transcription. Such misnotation was fairly common at the time, perhaps for ease of reading. The rhythms are not always straightforward ‚Äì the 3/2 hornpipes show the characteristic syncopation of the form, generally across the second beat in even numbered bars. As in most other Northumbrian examples of 3/2 hornpipes, the syncopated note is not tied, but a pair of repeated notes. Some strains in tunes of other types, such as 6/4 and 9/4 jigs, are also syncopated. Dick Hensold has argued that the collection can be split into two distinct parts, one family consisting of the single octave tunes, many corresponding to known Northumbrian smallpipe tunes, or similar in style to known examples of these, while the other, somewhat larger, group contains tunes which use the full nine-note melodic range of a nine-note chanter, with its greater harmonic possibilities. In particular, many tunes use the subtonic chord, G major in Matt Seattle's transcription, as well as the A major chord which is consonant with the drones. Most of the tunes in either group have strains based on two chords, typically G major and A major for the nine-note tunes, but several, notably \\"Dorrington\\", are significantly richer, with the dissonant chord varying from strain to strain. One tune from the smallpipe group, Gingling Geordie, has been placed online at the Dragonfly Music website.Gingling Geordie, music on line, Dragonfly Music It is an illustration of the style and inventiveness of the Dixon tunes, and it compares well with later versions. Several of these, and two 17th century versions, can be found on the FARNE archive; more modern versions, since its use as an election song, have been known as Wylam Away. They are all (except for a single minuet) 'long variation sets'; sets of four or more strains, based on the same underlying harmonic pattern as the first, (typically only 2 chords), and all variations ending in a common melodic 'tag'. The tags of different tunes are clearly recognisable, and a feature of the harmonic scheme is how the underlying chords fit with the drones, and the rhythm of the resulting concord and dissonance. As an example, in Gingling Geordie, typically for smallpipe tunes, the underlying chords are the tonic, A major, and supertonic, B minor ‚Äì the latter is dissonant against drones sounding in A, and here each strain reaches this chord at its midpoint. Melodically, strains are constructed from simple standard motifs, maybe repeated, in Gingling Geordie these lead into the supertonic at the end of the first 2-bar phrase, and the tag in the tonic at the end. It should be stressed that in some tunes the harmonic pattern is shifted, so the tonic chord does not necessarily fall at the end. A lot of the melodic motifs are 'floating' in that they are used in several different tunes ‚Äì perhaps at different pitches to fit a different harmony. The importance of this structure to the player is that these motifs lie well under the fingers on Border Pipes, so the music is technically not as difficult as it sounds, either to play or to learn. The effect for the listener, though, is one of structured improvisation.  Modern response  The publication of the music in 1995 led to a significant response ‚Äì Border Pipers had available a larger body of traditional music appropriate to the instrument, and this led to considerable discussion in the community about how it might be approached. In particular, the Lowland and Border Pipers‚Äô Society's 1997 Collogue was devoted wholly to the Dixon music and related questions. The talks given there have since been published by the LBPS as Out of the Flames. In 1999, Matt Seattle released a CD, also called Out of the Flames, DGM 9907, in which several of the Dixon tunes were recorded ‚Äì many pipers and others have released recordings of Dixon tunes since then. Matt Seattle maintains a 'Dixxxography', of all recordings of the Dixon music.Dixxxography There have been 40 recordings, including 23 of the tunes. Two of the tunes were played directly from the manuscript in Perth Library.Perth Library recording, Pete Stewart and Callum ArmstrongPerth Library, Pete Stewart and Callum Armstrong. The recent third edition of The Master Piper includes, inter alia, a much fuller discussion of the relationships between the Dixon tunes and those in other published and manuscript sources. Many of these relationships have been greatly clarified since the first edition appeared. In April 2015, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the manuscript's publication, Matt Seattle and others held a Homecoming Concert in Stamfordham parish church, where many of the Dixon family are buried.Homecoming Concert in Stamfordham parish church, Matt Seattle The tunes are played each week by musicians who gather at the Canon pub in Jedburgh.

The main dome is 6.5m in diameter and houses a 0.61 m Newtonian Reflecting telescope. There is a club meeting room that hosts society meetings and lectures and also serves as a lecture theatre for the public on open evenings. The complex has workshop, kitchen, office, storage and toilet facilities. Early history The first meeting of Mansfield and Sutton Astronomical Society (MSAS) took place in February 1970, and early meetings took place at the premises of a local engineering company. The founding members quickly formed a plan to build an Observatory, and by 1972 a piece of land had been purchased at one of the highest points in Nottinghamshire. Site preparation commenced and the foundations were poured in 1975. All building work was done by members, with the majority of materials being reclaimed from local demolition sites. The dome itself was designed with the help of the University of Nottingham Architecture department. The main ring-beam and aperture guides for the dome were made from 4x2 inch steel channeling, bent to shape by hand with the aid of a large hydraulic jack normally used to lift heavy goods vehicles. Thirty supporting ribs were then made from T-section aluminium, and 120 sheets of aluminium all individually cut and shaped by hand were fixed to the structure by over 5,000 rivets, each of which was drilled and punched by hand. With a roof on the lecture theatre the building was now weatherproof and work could commence on the electrical systems and the telescope itself. The main frame of the telescope was built by members from scaffold tubing and mounted on an equatorial fork driven by DC electrical motors for tracking the stars. The main mirror was ground at the observatory by a home-made mirror grinding machine over a period of 4 years, however this piece of glass was damaged when sent away for aluminising. After a period of fundraising a mirror was purchased and installed in the telescope with Messier 42, the Orion Nebula, being the target for first light. Sherwood Observatory was officially opened in 1986 by the Astronomer Royal, Professor Sir Francis Graham-Smith. Telescope The main instrument at Sherwood Observatory is a Newtonian telescope on an equatorial fork mount. The telescope was initially constructed as a Nasmyth reflector, but due to collimation problems it was converted in the 1990s to the simpler Newtonian configuration. The telescope has stepper motor drive control with an electrical focusser. The dome is electrically driven and will move automatically as the telescope tracks across the sky. Various cameras can be attached to the telescope to record images and video and display what the telescope sees on a 2 metre wide projector screen in the lecture theatre, from where the telescope can be controlled.

It opened in 1856 and was seen as a link in providing a through line between Glasgow and Portpatrick, then the ferry port for the north of Ireland. Although a short line it succeeded in achieving profitability, eventually being absorbed on generous terms by the Glasgow and South Western Railway. The line is still in use today as part of the Glasgow South Western Line.  History =False starts The Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway (GPK&AR;) was opened as far as Ayr in 1840, but its Ayr station was on the north bank of the River Ayr. (The GPK&AR; was a predecessor company of the Glasgow and South Western Railway.) At this early date, thought was given to reaching Portpatrick, which was the port for a short sea route ferry service to Donaghadee in the north of Ireland. For a time the GPK&AR; had other priorities, but during the frenzy of railway schemes that arose in 1845, a Glasgow and Belfast Union Railway (G&BUR;) was promoted; it was supported by the GPK&AR;, and its parliamentary costs were partly funded by that company. Portpatrick seemed to be an important destination for a line, although there was much wild and difficult territory to be crossed to get there: in the same year the British and Irish Union Railway (B&IUR;), an independent concern, was proposed to run from Dumfries via Castle Douglas to Portpatrick. The G&BUR; was to run by way of Patna, and a third line was proposed to cross the wild country of Galloway, the Ayrshire and Galloway Railway (A&GR;); it would form a junction with the G&BUR; at Smithston, near Patna, and run through Dalmellington to Castle Douglas, there linking with the British and Irish Union Railway. The frenzy of railway schemes lasted for a while but then the bubble burst in 1846, and ambitious and expensive proposals found that they could not get the financial support they needed. The B&IUR; announced that it was not proceeding on 21 April 1846, and the A&GR; scheme was cut back drastically, to run from Smithston to Dalmellington only, a tiny fraction of its intended extent. It was to have running powers over the G&BUR; to reach Ayr. The G&BUR; was authorised in the face of grave financial difficulty, and when the shareholders considered the reality of the situation, the decision was taken not to proceed with construction, and the expensively-won powers were allowed to lapse.David Ross, The Glasgow and South Western Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2104, The A&GR; scheme had been heavily cut back in Parliament, and with the G&BUR; now dormant, it was unable to connect to Ayr, so the promoters put forward a revised scheme in the next Parliamentary session. It won approval and the Ayrshire and Galloway (Smithstown & Dalmellington) Railway received the Royal Assent on 8 June 1847. It would connect with the GPK&AR; at Falkland Junction, a short distance north of their terminal station on the north shore of the River Ayr.Campbell Highet, The Glasgow and South Western Railway, Oakwood Press, Lingfield, 1965 The Glasgow and South Western Railway System map of the Ayr and Maybole Junction RailwayIn October 1850 the GPK&AR; merged with another company and the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;) was created. The new concern had pressing problems elsewhere, but was happy to encourage local initiatives to promote new lines. The lure of reaching Portpatrick remained, and at the end of 1852 the prospectus for an Ayr, Maybole and Girvan Railway was published. Although it was supported by the G&SWR;, this scheme too failed to attract sufficient support, and it came to nothing. Yet another truncated scheme was presented to Parliament in the 1854 session, and this time it was authorised: the Ayr and Maybole Junction Railway was incorporated on 10 July 1854. Capital was to be ¬£33,000 for the line of 5¬æ miles (9.3 km). The line was to diverge from the (as yet unbuilt) Ayr and Dalmellington line at Dalrymple Junction. The G&SWR; was authorised to work the line for 35% of gross receipts for a period of five years, thereafter at a rate to be determined by arbitration.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 The charge for working the line was considered low by some GS&WR; shareholders. Actual subscription for shares was disappointing, and the G&SWR; was obliged to subscribe ¬£10,000 to the scheme. Opening at last The line opened to goods trains on 15 September 1856, but the Inspecting Officer was not satisfied with the ballasting, and opening to passengers was accordingly delayed until 13 October 1856. In 1863 the working arrangement between the owning company and the GS&WR; was due to expire. Much work remained to be done in completing the stations, and the A&MJR; had been paying its shareholders handsome dividends but had failed to generate capital to complete the works. An impasse arose over the renewal of the working arrangement, and negotiations to absorb the A&MJR; into the G&SWR; also failed. The negotiations dragged on and the G&SWR; agreed a \\"perpetual working agreement\\" with a sliding scale of charges between 39% and 45% of gross receipts. The G&SWR; may have been motivated to concede better terms by the fear that the Caledonian Railway might step in. The new terms were ratified by Act of Parliament of 13 July 1863. The A&MJR; chairman was Rigby Wason, and his tenacity is credited with getting good terms for his company.Awdry, page 59Stephenson Locomotive Society, The Glasgow and South Western Railway 1850‚Äì1923, London, 1950, . Reaching Stranraer When the company was originally promoted, a direct rail connection between Glasgow and Portpatrick was contemplated; the A&MJR; saw itself as a link in that chain. In the event the harbour at Portpatrick was not developed as had been thought, although Stranraer took over as the dominant ferry port. The Portpatrick Railway had expended its meagre resources in reaching Portpatrick from Dumfries, but Rigby Wason launched an attack on the PR for failing to build a line northwards from Stranraer, as he considered had been promised. The word \\"fraud\\" was used. The Portpatrick Railway had no funds to build such a line, but the idea remained as an objective. The gap was closed by two nominally independent companies. The Maybole and Girvan Railway opened its line on 24 May 1860. The A&MJR; terminus at Maybole was at Redbrae, and it was unsuitable for conversion to a through station, so the M&GR; by-passed it, building a new through station further west. The old terminus served as a goods yard. The M&GR; company succumbed to absorption into the G&SWR; in 1865. The wild territory between Girvan and Stranraer took longer to traverse; the Girvan and Portpatrick Junction Railway opened its line across challenging terrain in 1877. It joined the Portpatrick Railway at Challoch Junction, entering Stranraer over that company's line. It was always in financial difficulties, and however desirable it was to have a direct line between Glasgow and Stranraer, the income generated hardly paid for the outgoings. After an unsuccessful capital reconstruction the line was sold to the G&SWR; in 1892.David L Smith, The Little Railways of South West Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, H D Thorne, Rails to Portpatrick, T Stephenson and Sons Ltd, Prescot, 1976, Absorbed by the G&SWR; The A&MJR; had long held out for better terms if absorption by the G&SWR; was to take place. A guaranteed 5% on capital had been rejected, and in 1871 terms were finally agreed. An Act of 29 June 1871 confirmed the absorption of the A&MJR;, which had effectively taken place on 1 February 1871. The terms were a remarkable guaranteed 7%. The G&SWR; Vice Chairman was asked to explain the generous terms at the Extraordinary General Meeting called to ratify the deal, and he replied that \\"we could not get it for less\\".Reported in Glasgow Herald (newspaper), 2 February 1871, quoted in Ross In 1911 the company was finally dissolved and vested in the G&SWR;, the 7% dividend guarantee being sustained. The present day The Ayr and Maybole Junction line continues in use at the present (2014) as part of the line between Ayr and Stranraer. Passenger services are operated under the brand Glasgow South Western Line. The original Maybole terminus has long been closed. Topography The Ayr and Maybole Junction Railway line opened to passenger traffic on 13 October 1856. The line diverged from the Ayr and Dalmellington line at Dalrymple Junction; from that date there was a station immediately south of the junction, serving both lines, named Maybole Junction, but it closed on 1 December 1859. The next station was Dalrymple, followed by Cassillis. Both those stations closed to passengers on 6 December 1954.R V J Butt, The Directory of Railway Stations, Patrick Stephens Limited, Sparkford, 1995, The Maybole terminus closed to passengers on 24 May 1860 when the Girvan line opened; it remained in use as a goods depot until closure in 1965.Col M H Cobb, The Railways of Great Britain -- A Historical Atlas, Ian Allan Publishing Limited, Shepperton, 2003,  Connections to other lines  * Ayr and Dalmellington Railway at Dalrymple Junction * Maybole and Girvan Railway at Maybole  References = Sources  *  External links  * Railscot on Ayr and Maybole Railway Category:Glasgow and South Western Railway Category:Pre-grouping British railway companies Category:Early Scottish railway companies Category:Railway companies established in 1854 Category:Railway lines opened in 1856 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1871 Category:British companies established in 1854 Category:British companies disestablished in 1871 ","title":"Ayr and Maybole Junction Railway"},{"id":"12737007","title":"Straight in a Gay Gay World"},{"id":"12737016","text":"F√§hrmann () or Faehrmann (meaning \\"ferryman\\") is a German surname.

She was the first woman to be awarded the Polar Medal, and as such was invited to join the Antarctic Club in recognition of her research work for the British Antarctic Survey and University of Sheffield into very low frequency radio propagation. Early life She was born Virginia Pepper in Godalming, Surrey in 1947. Her family owned chalk quarries in Amberley on the South Downs: now Amberley Working Museum. When she was 9, she met the 12-year-old Ranulph Fiennes, her future husband and they got married in 1970.Who's Who A & C Black 1971 p1045 After school, she took up deep-sea diving and was recruited to work for two years in Wester Ross for the National Trust for Scotland. She was also trained at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, took marine radio officer courses and joined the Women's Royal Army Corps Territorials. Career In 1968, she organised the first ascent of the longest river in the world, the River Nile, by prototype hovercraft. Three years later, she organised the first transnavigation of British Columbia, entirely by river. In 1972, she was commissioned by Woman's Own magazine to live for two months with an Omani family, and later organised four expeditions with her husband to locate the lost frankincense city of Ubar in Dhofar.finally achieving success in 1990: 1992, Debrett's People of Today p 2047 In 1972, she devised a plan to circumnavigate the world along its polar axis, and ten years later her Transglobe Expedition team became the first to reach both poles, to cross Antarctica and the Arctic Ocean, through the North West Passage. Family life In the 1980s, she moved to Exmoor National Park and began to raise a herd of pedigree Aberdeen Angus cattle and a flock of black Welsh Mountain sheep, becoming a highly proficient hill farmer on one of the highest working farms in the South West.

Origin According to tradition, Adnan is the father of a group of the Ishmaelite Arabs who inhabited West and Northern Arabia; he is a descendant of Ishmael, son of Abraham. Adnan is believed by genealogists to be the father of many Ishmaelite tribes along the Western coast of Arabia, Northern Arabia and Iraq. Many family trees have been presented by Adnan, which did not agree about the number of ancestors between Ishmael and Adnan but agreed about the names and number of the ancestors between Adnan and the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The overwhelming majority of traditions and Muslim scholars state that Adnan is a descendant of Kedar the son of Ishmael, except for Ibn Ishaq who claimed that Adnan was a descendant of Nebaioth,Siratu Rasulillah, Volume 1, Page 1 this confusion of Ibn Ishaq can be because one of the descendants of Kedar was also named \\"Nebaioth\\". Most of Muslim scholars refused any attempt to recite the ancestors between Adnan to Ishmael, and condemned some other scholars such as Ibn Ishaq for doing it. Family Family tree from Adnan to Muhammad Adnan had two sons, Ma'ad ibn Adnan and Akk ibn Adnan. Akk dwelt in the Yaman because he took a wife amongst the Asharites and lived with them, adopting their language. The Asharites were descended from Saba' ibn Yashjub ibn Ya'rub ibn Qahtan. In Pre-Islamic Arabia Adnan was mentioned in various Pre-Islamic poems, such as the Pre- Islamic poets: \\"Lubayb Ibn Rabi'a\\" and \\"Abbas Ibn Mirdas\\". Adnan was viewed by Pre-Islamic Arabs as an honorable father among the fathers of Arab tribes, and they used this ancestry to boast against other Qahtani tribes who were a minority among the Adnanites. Layla Bent Lukayz, a Pre-Islamic female poet, was captured by a Persian king and forced to marry him, so she composed a poem designated to other Arab tribes, asking for their help and reminding that she and them all belong to Adnan, which makes it a duty for them to rescue her. In other poems such as the ones composed by the Pre-Islamic poet \\"Qumma'a Ibn Ilias\\", it appears that Arabs considered it as an \\"Honor\\" to be a descendant of Adnan, and for some reason they appear to have been proud of it. In North Arabian inscriptions The name of Adnan was found many times in various Thamudic inscriptions, but with few details. In some Nabataean inscriptions, Adnan seems to hold some kind of importance or venerability, to the extent that some Nabataean (Nabioth's descendants. Nabioth was first son of Ishmael) people were named after him as \\"Abd Adnon\\" (The Servant/Slave of Adnan). There is no particular indication that he was worshiped, except as an honorable figure, exactly as some other Arabs called some of their sons as \\"servants\\" of their fore-fathers. Death Adnan died after Nebuchadnezzar II returned to Babylon. After Adnan's death, his son Ma'ad moved away to the region of Central-Western Hijaz after the destruction of the Qedarite kingdom near Mesopotamia, and the remaining Qedarite Arabs there were displaced from their lands and forced to live in Al-Anbar province and on the banks of the Euphrates river under the rule of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Descent from Adnan to Muhammad According to Islamic tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was descended from Adnan. It has also been reported, through many speeches, that Adnan foretold the coming of Muhammad and ordered his successors to follow him. \\"The following is the list of chiefs who are said to have ruled the Jazeera and to have been the intraline ancestors of Muhammad.\\" * Adnan * Ma'ad (ŸÖÿπÿØ) * Nizar (ŸÜÿ≤ÿßÿ±) * Mudhar (ŸÖÿ∂ÿ±) * Ilyas (ÿ•ŸÑŸäÿßÿ≥) * Mudrikah (ŸÖÿØÿ±ŸÉÿ©) * Khuzaimah (ÿÆÿ≤ŸäŸÖÿ©) * Kinanah (ŸÉŸÜÿßŸÜÿ©) * al-Nadr (ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ∂ÿ±) * Malik (ŸÖÿßŸÑŸÉ) * Fihr (ŸÅŸáÿ±) * Ghalib (ÿ∫ÿßŸÑÿ®) * Lu'ay (ŸÑÿ§Ÿä) * Ka'b (ŸÉÿπÿ®) * Murrah (ŸÖÿ±ÿ©) * Kilab (ŸÉŸÑÿßÿ®) * Qusai (ŸÇÿµŸä) * Abd Manaf (ÿπÿ®ÿØ ŸÖŸÜÿßŸÅ) * Hashim (Ÿáÿßÿ¥ŸÖ) * Abd al-Muttalib (ÿπÿ®ÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ∑ŸÑÿ®) * Abd Allah (ÿπÿ®ÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá) * Muhammad (ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ) See also *Qahtan *Adnan (name) *Ahl al-Bayt *Family tree of Muhammad *Family tree of Shaiba ibn Hashim *Ancestry of Qusai ibn Kilab *Banu Hashim *Banu Quraysh *Banu Kinanah *Banu Mudhar Further reading * The dwelling places and wanderings of the Arabian tribes, by Heinrich Ferdinand W√ºstenfeld, in German * Were the Qays and Yemen of the Umayyad Period Political Parties?

Life Most scholars agree that the Gaspar Fernandes listed as a singer in the cathedral of √âvora, Portugal, is the same person as the Gaspar Fern√°ndez who was hired on 16 July 1599 as organist and organ tuner of the cathedral of Santiago de Guatemala. In 1606, Fernandes was approached by the dignitaries of the cathedral of Puebla, inviting him to become the successor of his recently deceased friend Pedro Berm√∫dez as chapel master. He left Santiago de Guatemala on 12 July 1606, and began his tenure in Puebla on 15 September. He remained there until his death in 1629. Work One of his most important achievements for posterity was the compilation and binding in 1602 of various choir books containing Roman Catholic liturgical polyphony, several of which are extant in Guatemala. These manuscripts contain music by Spanish composers Francisco Guerrero, Crist√≥bal de Morales, and Pedro Berm√∫dez; the latter was with Fernandes at the time in the cathedral of Guatemala. To complete these books, Fernandes composed a cycle of 8 Benedicamus Domino, the versicle that follows the Magnificat at vespers and certain Masses, one in each of the 8 ecclesiastical tones or modes. He also added his own setting of the Magnificat in the fifth tone, some faux bordon versicles without text, and a vespers hymn for the Feast of the Guardian Angels. During his Puebla tenure, rather than focusing on the composition of Latin liturgical music, he contributed a sizable amount of vernacular villancicos for matins. This part of his output shows great variety in the handling of texts, which are in Spanish but also in pseudo-African and Amerindian dialects and occasionally Portuguese. One of these villancicos, \\"Xicochi,\\" is notable for its use of Nahuatl, the language of the indigenous Nahua people. The music departs from 16th century counterpoint and reflects the new baroque search for textual expression. The main collection of these villancicos is extant in the Oaxaca Codex, and has been studied, edited, and published by Robert Stevenson and especially by Aurelio Tello. References *Aurelio Tello.
