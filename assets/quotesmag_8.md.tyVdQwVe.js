It is about 9 km from Saundatti. One of the oldest villages in the Belgaum District, Hooli is the site of the Panchaligeswara temple and the Trikuteshwara Temple. The village is historically rich, boasting of a ruined fort atop a hill and numerous temples. Hooli has been under the rule of the Rattas of Saundatti, Patwardhans of Ramdurg and most of the temples feature Chalukya architecture and were initially Jain Bastis indicating a Chalukya rule. The name of the village is a corrupted form of PooValli meaning a flowery ear ornament. The village was also called MahishpatiNagar in ancient times. Hooli temples=Panchalingeshwara temple Hooli The nice architecture of Hooli Panchalingeshwar Temple is to be adored. It is a protected monument that comes under Archaeological Survey of India. Earlier, during summer afternoons people used to rest in the shade of this temple. Because the temple was made of stone, it was unbelievably cool even in the scorching summer. Opposite the Panchalingeshwara temple is the relatively modern Hari Mandir. The Sant Culture or Nath tradition influenced heavily by Jnaneshwar flourished here. Conservation and restoration Other than Panchalingeshwara Temple, Hooli has many other old temples; most of them are now in ruins due to negligence. One can be amazed by the sculptures and carvings on the stone. Most of the temples have their floor dug up for treasure hunts, so much is lost and stolen. Other temples at Hooli include: * Andhakeshwara Temple * Bhavnisankara Temple * Kalmeshwara Temple * Kashi Vishwanatha Temple * Madaneshwara Temple * Suryanarayan Temple * Tarkeshwara Temple * Hooli Sangameshwar Ajjanavaru Temple * Beerdevar temple Hooli Tourism plans There probably are plans or proposals to convert the Panchlingeshwar Temple site to a tourist destination. To achieve this objective, the concerned central/state department has performed survey and has been in discussion with the local people. This development may involve the demolition of local houses within the perimeter of some 100‚Äì200 meters. In case this happens, it would be a great shame, as this very structures, most of them mud houses surrounding the temple are also a part of the village history and carry invaluable importance to the local architecture settings. In India, the lessons needs to be derived from observing how some of the world heritage sites around the world, is being preserved and more importantly recreated as its original state. An ideal solution to preserve the architecture and as well encourage tourism is to develop a tourism infrastructure outside the village and then facilitate organized tours to the temple. Hotels, restaurants, shops, parking places etc. should not be allowed to flourish anywhere within the existing village or nearby the temple site and instead be located outside the village. If required, evacuate the population in affected perimeter, but preserve each and every structures as they are and convert them to museums. The village Hooli is still alive with activity and its surroundings has lot of history and architecture to share with tourists and fill few museums around the site. Any development in the vicinity of the site is going to be disastrous, difficult to maintain, and lose the charm of the very architecture piece, that is being showcased. Not to say that the impacted villagers will not only lose their ancestral home, but instead become detached from the village itself, where, their ancestors once upon a time created and served this archaeological masterpiece. Rather, the old mud houses should be maintained as they are and there owners / residents should be made partners in their conservation. For someone, who has experienced and lived in the village 30 or 40 years back, which once had streets paved with cobbled stones, the ruins of temple around the village which had number of precious architecture pieces, is now all but stolen or destroyed. Further degradation is not necessary in name of the preservation and encouraging tourism. Shivakashi Stream  Shivakashi Valley seems to be a place which was once densely covered by trees. At this location you can find the marks left by monsoon springs and water falls. Based on stories from village elders there were tigers once upon a time. Village folks hunted them off decades ago. The location otherwise is dotted with many temples and wells. There is a Dhyan Mandir used by Krishnaraj Swamiji as the legend has it. The view from the top of the hill is picturesque. The water cascades down at various levels and flows to join the lake in front of KereSiddeshwara Temple. Hooli surname  Ancestors born & brought up at this place migrated to nearby villages over a long period of time, they were referred to as people from \\"Hooli\\", hence many families have their surnames as \\"Hooli\\". However, the most common surnames in the village itself are Munavalli,Kulkarni, Patil, Chikkareddi. These families have been living in the same area for hundreds of years now and every family is invariably interrelated.

Literature * In Edward Albee's play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Martha, in revealing to Nick that she devised a plan to marry one of the college staff, remarks that \\"I wasn't the albatross\\". * In Brian Keene's novel The Conqueror Worms, the character Salty mentions that it is bad luck to kill an albatross. The narrator, Teddy, also speaks of how \\"The Ancient Mariner was sent an albatross ... Noah was sent a dove\\", while he himself was sent a crow. * In Anne Rice's novel Interview with the Vampire, Louis de Pointe du Lac quoted these lines when referring to Claudia: \\"Her lips were red, her looks were free, Her locks were yellow as gold: Her skin was as white as leprosy, The Night-mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she, Who thicks man's blood with cold\\".'' * In James M. Cain's crime novel Double Indemnity, Phyllis is described as the creature who came on board ship to shoot dice in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. * The poem features prominently in the plot of Douglas Adams's novel Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. In the novel, the title character time travels to interrupt Coleridge's work on his poem \\"Kubla Khan\\"; during his rambling dialogue, intended to disrupt Coleridge from unintentionally encoding information from a ghost which could lead to the destruction of the human race, Dirk Gently's references to \\"Albert Ross\\", another character from the novel, are misheard by Coleridge as \\"albatross,\\" which he says might have given him an idea for another poem he is working on, which he considers superior to a previous idea involving a meteor striking the Earth. * Gene Wolfe's science fiction novella, The Fifth Head of Cerberus, uses as its motto the lines: \\"When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow, / And the owlet whoops to the wolf below, / That eats the she-wolf's young\\". * In Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, chapter 5, Victor Frankenstein quotes the lines: \\"Like one, that on a lonesome road / Doth walk in fear and dread / And, having once turned round, walks on / And turns no more his head / Because he knows a frightful fiend / Doth close behind him tread\\" (Penguin Popular Classic 1968 page 57, cited from Rime, 1817 edition). In the book's opening letters from Robert Walton to his sister, specifically Letter II, Walton explicitly mentions the poem by name and claims he \\"shall kill no albatross\\" on his journey. * In Clive Cussler's novel Iceberg, several references are made to the poem and it is quoted several times. The villain's company logo is the albatross. In another novel The Silent Sea, four lines from the poem are written on the page before the prologue. * In Garth Nix's Keys to the Kingdom series, the Mariner is an ancient and powerful being. He claims his real name is Captain Tom Shelvocke, and he mentions accidentally shooting an albatross. * In Lights Out by Peter Abrahams, the protagonist Eddie Nye has memorised the poem during his 15 years in prison. He ponders many aspects of the poem as his own story unfolds. The plot of the novel reflects several aspects of the poem. * The poem is heavily referred to in the Connie Willis science fiction novel, Passage. * The poem plays a crucial role in W. W. Denslow's 1904 children's book, The Pearl and the Pumpkin. * The author Garry Kilworth, known for the Welkin Weasels trilogy, was inspired by Coleridge for the entire trilogy. For example, when Sherriff Falshed is on the run from a dragonfly nymph, he quotes \\"A frightful fiend, did close behind him swish\\", and also in the third book the entire scene with Death is re-enacted with a walrus and a nebulous shadow, when the weasels pass their ghostly vessel. * In his poem \\"Snake\\", D. H. Lawrence compares the albatross in Ancient Mariner to the poem's subject, a snake. * Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons's Watchmen includes a story within a story \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\", which bears similarities to the poem through its supernatural themes and the tale of a mariner's impending doom. * Charles Baudelaire (who also translated E. A. Poe into French) revisits the scene with the albatross (see D√ºrer's illustration above), suggesting the poet is the albatross rather than the mariner. (\\"The Albatross\\", 1857, Flowers of Evil). * In Michael Morpurgo's novel Alone on a Wide, Wide Sea, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is featured heavily and key ideas from the poem are used in the novel. * In M. R. James's short story, Casting the Runes, a prior victim of Karswell received in the mail a (fictional) engraving of a man pursued by a demon, supposed to have been torn from a volume of Bewick's engravings, with a quotation from the poem written upon it: \\"having once looked round ‚Äì walks on, And turns no more his head, Because he knows a frightful fiend Doth close behind him tread.\\" * In Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story \\"Footprints on the Sea-Shore\\", published in Twice-Told Tales, the main character walks along the seashore and at one point he \\"encountered a bird,‚Äîa large gray bird,‚Äîbut whether a loon, or a wild goose, or the identical albatross of the Ancient Mariner, was beyond my ornithology to decide.\\" Games * The videogame, Alpha Protocol, features a character known as Albatross. One of the dossier packages players can unlock for him states that he takes his name from the poem, which alludes to the vengeance he unleashes if hurt. * In the online computer game Guild Wars, the opening lines of NPC Samti Kohlreg's dialogue and the name of his quest reference the poem and the author. In its sequel, Guild Wars 2, the name of the item Rime-Rimmed Mariner's Rebreather is a reference to the poem. * The Ancient Mariner appears as a rare miniature in the game Horrorclix' 2008 Nightmares set, carrying the soul of a dead sailor and a piece of the Albatross. * In the collectible card game Magic: The Gathering, the flavor texts of the cards Scathe Zombies, Wall of Ice and Will-o'-the-Wisp (all from the Limited Edition Alpha set) are quotes from the poem. * In the Soulcalibur series of video games, the pirate Cervantes de Leon has a throw move named \\"Curse of the Ancient Mariner\\" (called \\"Rime of Ancient Mariner\\" in the Japanese version). Shura, a Japanese demon slayer appearing in Soulcalibur IV, can also use the move, despite having no connection to mariners, the high seas or anything else mentioned in the poem ‚Äì this is because she shares a moveset with Cervantes. * In the online computer game Vanguard: Saga of Heroes, in the city of Martok, there is an NPC (non-player character) Orc named Rolyat Leumas, the Ancient Seafarer of Martok. If the player questions him, he will tell the complete story of the Rime of the Ancient Mariner, with minor modifications to make it appropriate to the game world.

The main character, believing his wife unfaithful, kills her and is sentenced to death. At his trial, he blasphemes by proclaiming Heaven a lie and asking that if he be mistaken, that Heaven do what it pleases with his soul. Instead of being executed, the man is condemned to sail the oceans of the world for eternity and becomes literally unable to die, until he can find a woman who loves him enough to die for him. Every seven years, he may search for her on land for six months.

The Scotsman is uninterested, but is convinced to at least hear the name of his story, which is revealed to be \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\\" * Monty Python performed a sketch (Series 1, Episode 13, Albatross) which figured John Cleese as a cinema usherette with a tray hung around her neck containing an albatross instead of the more normal choc ices. * In the Firefly episode \\"Objects in Space\\", the character River Tam (Summer Glau) was nicknamed \\"Albatross\\" and in Serenity was subsequently referred to as an albatross by the Operative. * At the end of the SeaQuest DSV episode \\"Hide and Seek\\", Roy Scheider can be heard reciting one of the last stanzas of this poem over the closing scene. * In the episode of Only Fools and Horses, \\"Sleeping Dogs Lie\\" Rodney remarks regarding his Uncle Albert \\"I've said it before, I'll say it again: that man's a right Jonah. I reckon that when he boarded his last ship, the crew shot an albatross for luck.\\" Sports * Baseball pitcher Diego Segu√≠, who was pitching for the Seattle Mariners at the age of 40, was tagged by sportswriters as \\"The Ancient Mariner\\".

The RCA Roundtable) was a Modern Orthodox rabbinic think tank that functioned from 1988 until 1994. Originally conceived by a group of orthodox rabbis and laypersons in the New York area, the goal of the Roundtable was to promote halakhic discussion of pressing contemporary issues, and to suggest solidly grounded responses to those problems. The solutions offered were meant to reflect authentic, valid halakhic responses that would reflect the spectrum of the Modern Orthodox community. In this sense, the group would provide a counterbalance to the already palpable 'shift to the right' that appeared to characterize orthodox Jewish legal authorities and thinking. From 1990 until 1992, the group was officially part of the Rabbinical Council of America, whose president, Rabbi Marc Angel, was a founding member of the group. Early history The initial organization of the Roundtable was undertaken in the Spring of 1988 by Rabbi Jeffrey Woolf, at the behest of prominent lay and rabbinic leaders from Riverdale, NY, where he resided. Woolf, who had studied for ten years under Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik and was a doctoral candidate at Harvard University, was suggested to the founders as a good representative of Modern Orthodox principles. Over the next few months, a group of prominent Orthodox Rabbis agreed to join the initiative. Most, though not all, were graduates of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS) of Yeshiva University, and had themselves studied under Rabbi Soloveitchik. The initial core group included: Rabbis J. Simcha Cohen, Reuven Bulka, Yosef Adler, Haskel Lookstein, Marc Angel, Yitz Greenberg, Jacob J. Schacter, Daniel Landes, Mark Dratch, Michael Broyde, Louis Bernstein, Abner Weiss, Daniel Tropper and Saul Berman. The group was later joined by Rabbis Simcha Weinberg and Adam Mintz. In the interim Rabbi Schacter resigned from the group. Rabbis Cohen and Bulka were elected as co- chairmen. Rabbi Woolf was appointed as Executive Chairman. Activity Over the course of the next five years, the Roundtable issued a series of position papers on a wide range of cutting edge issues. Generally, these were authored by one member, and vetted by the group prior to publication. Each paper was carefully crafted and extensively documented. The members were well aware of the fact that they were asserting their right to a voice in Orthodox halakhic discourse. As a result, papers were only issued after being carefully reviewed by the most scholarly members of the group (and, on occasion, some who sympathized without actually joining). They were sent primarily to the members of the RCA, though anyone who was interested could receive one. A significant number of the topics treated by the Roundtable Papers stood at the center of controversy in the Orthodox World, some ten years later. Toward the end of its activity, the group was honored by receiving permission from Rav Ovadiah Yosef to publish an annotated translation of a responsum advocating the imposition of penalties upon a recalcitrant husband who refused to give a get to his wife. Cessation of Activity At the time, the groups efforts were both condemned and dismissed by Agudath Yisrael, and a number of the Roshei Yeshiva of RIETS. Primarily, they decried the temerity of these rabbis to venture into the halakhic lists. Responses of this type were reported in the Spring of 1991 in the Jerusalem Report. In an effort to strengthen the position in the community, Rabbi Marc Angel, engineered the adoption of the Roundtable by the Rabbinical Council of America. The merger was successful during Rabbi Angel's tenure. However, following his term in office, elements within and without the RCA sought to restrict and regulate its publications. In 1991, the partnership was dissolved and the Roundtable reverted to its earlier name and format. Subsequently, the organization was plagued by internal tensions, as well as political pressures. These caused an organizational re-shuffling in 1992, in which Rabbi Cohen resigned as co-chairman. Leadership remained in the hands of Rabbi Reuven Bulka and Rabbi Jeffrey Woolf. In the Summer of 1993, Rabbi Jeffrey Woolf made Aliyah to Israel, in order to accept a faculty position in the Talmud Department of Bar Ilan University. Rabbi Adam Mintz, then the senior rabbi at Lincoln Square Synagogue, succeeded him as Executive Chairman. The Orthodox Roundtable ceased operations in the Summer of 1994.

The building currently houses a 49-room Autograph Hotel, called SCHLOSS LIESER, AUTOGRAPH COLLECTION, which is scheduled to open for guests summer 2019. History thumb thumb The castle was created on the site of a 1710-built church property. Today's castle was designed by the architect Heinrich Theodor Schmidt in 1884‚Äì1887 as the residence for the family of the winery owner Eduard Puricelli. Eduard Puricelli founded and led several gas industries, including in Trier and also in the Rheinb√∂ller hut. Puricelli applied several times for Catholic and conservative parties to Members mandates and belonged to the constituent Reichstag of the North German Confederation. After the German-French war 1870/71 Puricelli continued for economic reasons, together with eleven other companies in Trier for the Annexation of Alsace-Lorraine. Eduard Puricellis daughter Maria, sole heiress of parental possessions, married in 1880 the high Prussian officer Dr. Clemens Freiherr von Schorlemer-Alst/ Clemens Freiherr von Schorlemer-Lieser (1856‚Äì1922). Through its activities in the Prussian administrative services Clemens von Schorlemer made the acquaintance Kaiser Wilhelm II, who appreciated him. In 1895/1904-1906 the castle was extended when Maria and Dr Clemens Freiherr von Schorlemer moved into the castle . The castle consists out of two components, the older part in forms of Neo-Renaissance and the younger part in the forms of Art Nouveau.http://bwpc08.fh- trier.de:8080/kuDb/servlet/ortObj?aktSchluessel=216http://www.licht1.homepage.t-online.de/lieser/html/body_schloss_lieser_und_der_schloss.html Outside The outside side is influenced by the Neo-Renaissance, but in outline ‚Äì according to the architect ‚Äì Neo-Gothic. The jewellery forms bays, gables and towers are oriented to the German forms of Late Renaissance. The entrance is protected by a tower were two free-standing granite columns rise. The Risalit/Avant-corps on the left side of the main facade is Risalit by large, spread over two floors, is emphasized. The Madonna statue at the corner near the chapel comes from Peter Fuchs,http://www.answers.com/topic/peter- fuchs-1 who also worked at the Cologne Cathedral. On the main facade there are representations from the fields of industry and agriculture. For the stone construction Mosel slates and red ‚Äì on the ground floor ‚Äì brighter Udelfanger sandstone were used. The roof has been made from the slate quarries of Cauber Erbstollens. thumb Ground plan, ground floor and staircase The ground plan is located between the Mosel river and the mountains, so that all rooms within the building ‚Äì as in English country houses - are along a corridor. The basic design of the building with the octagonal hall is based on Italian villas of the 16th (Palladio) and 17th centuries. The ground floor, in which mainly economic areas and the bottling plants were located, has been created very high for flood protection. In the stairwell between eight large pilasters painted landscapes and architectural motifs from the Mosel region created by Karl Julius Gr√§tz are located. The stairwell window with lead glazing has four painted medallions of Binsfeld and Janssen in Trier. The staircase itself is a self-construction of Trier sandstone with wrought-iron, partly gilded railings. thumb First floor The first floor is a Beletage with representation rooms. In the octagonal hall, where the stairs end, the sculptor's work, the pillars and the wall panelling have been created in light Burgreppacher sandstone. The ceiling has been plastered and contains several paintings. The first floor contains the rather sober work room, reception room, with pitch pine and oak wood-panelled dining room large with a rich and carved wooden ceiling and several doorframes, the small dining room for everyday use, a poolroom, several garden rooms, guest rooms and a kitchen. thumb Second floor The second floor is the private sector of the house. Is had been equipped with livingrooms, sleepingrooms, tourist rooms and rooms for servants. It also contains a wall table and a marble fireplace. The copper plate of the fireplace has been decorated with a presentation of Hubert Salentin from D√ºsseldorf.  Chapel The hall of Beletage links to the chapel, which is a building on its own. The wallpaintings are by Karl Julius Gr√§tz. The glass paintings are by Binsfeld and Janssen. Peter Fuchs created the saint statues. The mosaic floor with his figural representations was designed by the architect and produced in Mettlach. thumb The statue of the \\"housewife\\" and the other facilities A special feature of the paintings is the image originally situated on the terrace sculpture of the wife of the owner. With her old German costume, keys and wallet in hand, it symbolizes allegorical excessive. The carpentry work, furniture and other equipment details were drawings of the architects of Epple and Ege in Stuttgart. From the company M. Armbruster in Frankfurt the construction locks and art metalwork were created. The extension of 1895/1904-1906 It is unclear whether the extension of the castle was created in 1904‚Äì1906, or already built in 1895 ‚Äî the information differs. The historicism here takes the form of Art Nouveau. The main pavilion is a mid-wing, which served as a wintergarden. In front of the central axis of the three-pavilion construction a three-S√∂ller has been placed. The entrance to a building along is followed by a concrete tower. Inside the extended building is in one of the two staircases, an Art Nouveau railing.

In a public blog, his (now ex) wife Xarah Xavier stated: \\"Despite paying his 40% tax bracket for the whole of these 8 years the disgraceful nature of what the UK has now declared their IMMIGRATION LAW has forced us to re-locate to the fast paced, bright lights and creative urban community of LOS ANGELES. Thank you Tories. I salute you.\\".

The third of these is the easternmost point of the South Island, and should not be confused with West Cape, the westernmost point of the South Island. West Head marks the western side of the entrance to Tory Channel, and the corresponding East Head is located on Arapaoa Island. Easternmost point of South Island West Head, at the entrance to Tory Channel, is the easternmost point of the South Island. However, two other distinct headlands have very similar longitudes, sometimes leading to confusion and erroneous claims. West Head, at the entrance to Tory Channel, is recorded by Land Information New Zealand as longitude 174.3154¬∞E, and the easternmost tip is measured at 174.3157¬∞E (174¬∞18'57\\"E). Cape Jackson, LINZ longitude 174.3134¬∞E, easternmost tip measured at 174.3150¬∞E (174¬∞18'54\\"E), is about 100 metres further west. Both West Head and Cape Jackson are at the end of long, narrow and difficult-to- reach peninsulas in the Marlborough Sounds. For this reason third-place Cape Campbell, LINZ longitude 174.2760¬∞E, easternmost tip 174.2773¬∞E (174¬∞16'34\\") is sometimes mistakenly considered the easternmost point, but is about three kilometres further west.

Common categories of animals which are transported include livestock destined for sale or slaughter; zoological specimens; laboratory animals; race horses; pets; and wild animals being rescued or relocated. Methods of transporting animals vary greatly from species to species. History A painting of the fictional Don Quixote transporting a lion Humans have been transporting animals for a variety of purposes for thousands of years, with numerous accounts of animals transportation from the ancient world. Animals were transported for Roman circuses and for use as military animals. Two well-known historical examples of animals transported to foreign countries are Hanno the elephant and D√ºrer's Rhinoceros. Later, animals were transported from the New World to Europe for study and introduction. During the 20th century, the transportation of animals has focussed on the movement of animals for food, research, entertainment and conservation and the transport of animals is regulated in many countries. Such transport is regulated by a guideline by the European Council enacted in 2007, with relevant legislation passed in member countries, including England, through the Welfare of Animals (Transport), Order 2006 (\\"WATEO 2006\\"); and \\"equivalent national legislation in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland\\". The Animal Transportation Association was formed in 1976 by interested parties to develop best practices and provide information to those involved in the shipment of animals. In June 2020, the European Parliament has voted to establish an inquiry committee to investigate the transport of live animals across and out of the European Union.Campaigners welcome 'historic' EU inquiry into live animal transport, from 22. June 2020 in Theguardian.com Livestock Livestock destined for sale or slaughter, race horses, and pets are frequently transported. It is important to avoid injury and death of the animal during transportation. Research animals The Institute for Laboratory Animal Research of the United States National Research Council has produced guidelines for the transportation of research animals. Zoo animals Asali in her 4.4 crate being loaded for transportation from Perth Zoo to Monarto Safari Park, a journey of 2200km Wild animals are often transported for display in zoos. Some wild animals offer specific challenges. Elephants Elephants are regularly transported for circuses and as working animals but are less regularly transported between zoos.Miller, Michele (January 2012). \\"Transport Guidelines for Elephants\\" . Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Historically, war elephants were transported from their native countries to battlefields throughout the ancient world. Ptolemy II Philadelphus, in the 3rd century BCE, had ships custom-built for the purpose. Elephants employed by circuses were historically transported in Circus trains. In modern times, the transportation of elephants has often been contentious. In 2013, the CEO of Toronto Zoo stated that \\"whatever the mode of transport is, ground, air, rail, there are associated risks with moving elephants\\". The zoo had been unable to finalise a determination about the mode of transport for three elephants to a sanctuary in California. Another Toronto Zoo board member noted that if an elephant panics during air transport, \\"it may have to be euthanized\\". Giraffes An illustration of giraffes being transported, 1874 Giraffes are typically transported in custom- built containers or crates to account for their height. In 2013, Nakuru, a 15-month-old female giraffe, was transported from New Zealand to Melbourne in Australia. Her specialised 4.2 metre crate was transported by sea on a cargo ship. As is required by Australian law, Nakaru was quarantined for 30 days at the Werribee Open Range Zoo before being moved again by truck to Melbourne Zoo approximately 30 kilometres away. Earlier in 2013, Tonda, a 4.3-metre, three- year-old adult male, was moved from Paignton Zoo to Chessington Zoo, both in England. The 322-kilometre move was completed by a Dutch company that specialises in animal transportation using a specially built trailer with an adjustable roof. Lions Lions present particular transportation challenges because of their size and the danger they pose to humans. To transport two lions from Morocco to Germany, one specialist animal transportation company elected to move the animals by land, travelling via Gibraltar, Spain and France, rather than by air. The vehicle they used was extensively modified with new suspension and shock absorbers. In 2013, a South African zoologist received media attention for having transported 27 lions, mostly adult, in his Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van to relocate them from one wildlife park to another. Tapirs Though they are related to the horse and rhinoceros, tapirs are regulated as pachyderms by the United States Department of Agriculture for the purpose of transportation and import. One issue with the transporting of tapirs is that young tapirs must not be separated from their mother for the first year of their lives - and as tapirs must be separated from other tapirs in order to transport them, it can be very difficult to transport a young or baby tapir. In 2008, a three-year-old tapir, Romeo, was transported from Costa Rica to Nashville, Tennessee. Romeo was the first animal to leave the country legally and the first tapir to be transported to the United States in more than 20 years. A specially- constructed cage was used to transport the tapir on a cargo plane and the move itself was supervised by staff from the Nashville Zoo.Jacobs, Susan (2008). \\"Meineke Man Bonds with Endangered Wildlife\\". Jewish Journal. In 2013, Timmy, a 400-pound Baird's tapir who had suffered from ear infections, was sent by FedEx from Florida to Los Angeles as part of a breeding programme. He was kept in quarantine for 30 days after his trip. Aquarium animals There are two techniques for moving large marine mammals ‚Äì wet transit, in which the animal is kept in a large tank of water, and dry transit, in which the animal is placed in a padded sling and kept calm, wet, and cool by human assistance. The decision whether to use wet or dry transit will depend on the size of the animal being transported and the distance to be traveled. Killer whales The killer whale Keiko being transported on a Boeing C-17 Globemaster III The transportation of killer whales (orca) was a key feature of the popular film Free Willy. Keiko, who played the role of Willy in the film, was moved using a trailer - although when he was actually transported to the Oregon Coast Aquarium, he was airlifted by the United Parcel Service. When he was transported to the Westman Islands in Iceland in 1998, he was loaded onto a U.S. Air Force C-17 transport. Other whales The largest animal ever transported was J.J., a young gray whale who weighed and was long. She was fitted into a custom-made transport sling and lifted by crane onto a 40-foot foam-padded trailer, before being released, again by crane, just off Point Loma. FedEx has shipped at least seven whales to aquariums in slings inside of metal containers containing just enough water to keep the whales moist. Seals Transporting seals is considered to be easier than transporting cetaceans, since seals are semiaquatic and able to tolerate long periods out of water, as long as they are kept cool and moist. Cooling of the transported seal can be carried out by using a water spray, or placing ice above the seal's container which cools the seal as it melts. Transportation of domestic pets=By air Airlines vary in their policies on the transport of domestic pets, with some allowing pets in the passenger cabin and others insisting that they are transported in the same compartments as baggage, mail and other cargo. These compartments may be pressurized and may be maintained in a constant temperature range. The American Ferret Association, for example, offers advice on the policies of nineteen different carriers. Specialist animal air transportation companies exist and will arrange whole-aircraft charters for larger and outsize animal transportation projects, utilizing flying veterinarians to ensure the safety and comfort of the animal passengers. These companies often arrange aircraft for large-scale zoo relocation projects, transporting multiple exotic animals. =Controversies= In 2018, United Airlines admitted to forcing a passenger pet to be stowed away in an overhead bin, resulting in the animal's death. Only two days later, another dog aboard a United flight was mistakenly sent to Japan instead of its intended Kansas City destination. A similar incident occurred in March 2018 when Delta Airlines sent a puppy to Salt Lake City instead of its intended Boise destination. Passports In 2004 a change in EU law meant that as well as cats and dogs, ferret transportation was allowed within European Union borders. Currently the EU pet passport scheme only covers cats, dogs and ferrets that have been vaccinated against rabies and fitted with electronic microchips. As of yet, there is no EU wide legislation to cover transportation of other pets, with different member states applying various rules.

Historical context  The modern academic quarter calendar can be traced to the historic English law court / legal training pupillage four term system: * Hilary: January‚ÄìMarch * Easter: April‚ÄìMay * Trinity: June‚ÄìJuly * Michaelmas: October‚ÄìDecember This quarter system was adopted by the oldest universities in the English-speaking world (Oxford, founded circa 1096, and Cambridge, founded circa 1209). Over time, Cambridge dropped Trinity Term and renamed Hilary Term to Lent Term, and Oxford also dropped the original Trinity Term and renamed Easter Term as Trinity Term, thus establishing the three-term academic \\"quarter\\" year widely found in countries with a lineage to England or the United Kingdom. Charterhouse, an English independent school, still refers to its three academic terms as \\"quarters\\". United States= Background and trends  In the United States, quarters typically comprise 10 weeks of class instruction, although they have historically ranged from eight to 13 weeks.Kemp Malone, 'Semester' , American Speech, Dec. 1946, p. 264 Academic quarters first came into existence as such when William Rainey Harper organized the University of Chicago on behalf of John D. Rockefeller in 1891. Harper decided to keep the school in session year-round and divide it into four terms instead of the then-traditional two. Of the four traditional academic calendars (semester, quarter, trimester, and 4-1-4), the semester calendar is used the most widely, at over 60% of U.S. higher learning institutions, with fewer than 20% using the quarter system.Report of the 1998-99 ad hoc Calendar Committee, Northeastern University, July 30, 1999 This number has stayed fairly constant since 1930, when 75% of U.S. institutions surveyed indicated they used a semester plan, with 22% on the quarter system.H.W. James, The Semester versus the Quarter, Journal of Higher Education, Oct. 1930, p. 38 During the 1960s, a number of U.S. state university systems made a switch from a semester to quarter system, typically in an attempt to accommodate the Tidal Wave I enrollment boom, most prominently the University of California system.Debate: Semesters or Quarters, UCLA Faculty Senate Voice, Apr. 2003 (iss. 3) Since then, UC Berkeley switched back to semesters in 1983,Harlan Lebo, Semester vs. quarter?, UCLA Today, 2002 the new UC Merced branch opened with the semester system, and some UC professional schools have switched back to semesters at various points. In 2020, UC San Diego considered a switch to the semester system as well. At various points since the 1960s, committees have been established and official discussions have taken place within the UC system to discuss a systemwide switch back to the semester system.Chris Ziegler, Faculty Considers Switch from Quarter to Semester, (University of California, Santa Barbara) Daily Nexus, Jan. 29, 1990 (reprinted Jan. 29, 2007) In recent years, a number of higher education institutions have considered or approved a switch to a semester system. The University System of Ohio, which includes Ohio State University, Ohio University, and the University of Cincinnati, converted to the semester system in 2012 to better align with other public and private institutions in the state, among other reasons.Rich Rouan, OU Ready to Consider Switch to Semesters, Columbus Dispatch, June 26, 2008University of Cincinnati planning switch to semesters, Business Courier of Cincinnati, Apr. 29, 2008 Individual schools have also switched, like Georgia Tech in 1999.Hoyt Coffee, Regents Set Semester Switch, Georgia Tech Alumni magazine, Spring 1996 Rochester Institute of Technology converted to semesters in Fall 2013, although the decision was highly controversial, overriding a student vote to remain with quarters. Other institutions and systems that have switched include California State University, Los Angeles, Auburn University, the University of Minnesota system, the Utah State system, and Northeastern University. Southern Oregon University was required to study a switch to the semester system as part of state legislation on a possible merger with the University of Oregon. Arguments Concerns over the quarter system include faculty dislike of the brevity of the term, the loss of faculty research and collaboration time, the end of the spring quarter overrunning the start date of many established summer internships which also leads to shorter internship periods, difficulties in recovering from illness-linked absence, and the heavy administrative workload. A quarter system calendar also may put schools at a disadvantage in competing for prospective students, who wish to keep in-step with friends, and offer more opportunities for students to \\"disconnect from school.\\" The quarter system can also make more difficult the process of transferring credits for past coursework completed in semester institutions, including from other universities or community colleges in the same state. Quarter systems do allow students to enroll in a richer variety of courses and school-coordinated internships and may encourage students to take on double majors, minors, concentrations, and the like. A quarter system can maximize the use of college facilities in a time of enrollment growth, as it allows for four regular periods of academic instruction.Sarah Mohajeri, From Semesters to Quarters, in UCLA in the sixties, May 24, 2005 Also, quarters allow for faculty to engage in terms with a relatively light course load of teaching and greater opportunities for short sabbaticals.

Peaks) is an Israeli settlement in the West Bank located north of Jerusalem on Tawil hill adjacent to Ramallah, al-Bireh, and Kokhav Ya'akov. Established in 1981, it is organised as a community settlement and falls under the jurisdiction of Binyamin Regional Council, with the council's headquarters located there. In it had a population of . The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. Etymology The name Psagot was proposed by one of the early residents, Moshe Bar-Asher, a professor and head of the Academy of the Hebrew Language. It expresses the hope that the new village will achieve a peak in settlement and study of the Torah. The name also refers to the location of Psagot on the peak of Mount Tawil. History The Arabic name of the hill is Jabel Tawil (long mountain). Mateh Binyamin regional council headquarters, Psagot In the wake of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Jabel Tawil came under Jordanian rule. It was annexed by Jordan in 1950. Before 1967, Jabel Tawil was known to locals as \\"Kuwaiti hill\\" because of numerous visitors from the Persian Gulf who hiked in the area. In 1964, some of the land was purchased by the Jerusalem municipality for a future tourist resort. In the Six-Day War, it came under Israeli occupation. From September 1976, Arabs were prohibited from building in the area. According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated 780 dunams of land from the nearby Palestinian town of Al-Bireh in order to construct Psagot. Al Bireh City Profile ARIJ, p. 17 There is also an archaeological site near some of the Caravillas on the hill of Psagot. In 1981, Ariel Sharon, then Israeli Minister of Defense, told Pinchas Wallerstein, head of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, that he would support initiatives to settle the area. In July 1981, Wallerstein moved the council headquarters to the hill, then occupied by a military intelligence base. Five families from the Jerusalem neighborhood of Beit VeGan took up residence there. A year later, they were joined by a group from the Kerem B'Yavneh yeshiva who came to create a kollel.  Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict  According to B'Tselem, Psagot prevents the expansion of Ramallah and cuts it off from the surrounding villages.Brightonpalestinecampaign.org During the course of the Second Intifada, snipers shot at Psagot from buildings in Ramallah, leading to the construction of a concrete wall to protect the inhabitants. In 2001, the Israeli army stationed nearby fired two missiles into Ramallah targeting Marwan Barghouti. In November 2009, the Psagot settlement and Regavim petitioned the High Court of Justice in an unsuccessful attempt to stop construction of the Al-Bireh International Stadium, citing security concerns. The Sasson Report identified Psagot as the \\"parent settlement\\" of an Israeli outpost known as Mitzpe HaAi () located approximately 400 m to the southeast.Opinion on Unauthorized Settlements, Prime Minister's Office, 2005, Appendix I, \\"Detailed list of settlements\\", p. 37 According to the report, the settlement, unauthorized by the government, was built on land appropriated illegally from its Palestinian owners. According to Peace Now 75.69% of the combined area of Psagot and Mitzpe HaAi is on appropriated private land.Psagot and Mitzpe Ha'ai (outpost) Peace Now. Status under international law The international community considers Israeli settlements to violate the Fourth Geneva Convention's prohibition on the transfer of an occupying power's civilian population into occupied territory.The settlers' struggle BBC News. 19 December 2003 Israel disputes the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention and argues that the Palestinian territories were not legally held by a sovereign when Israel took control of them. This view has been rejected by the International Court of Justice and the International Committee of the Red Cross.Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory International Court of Justice, 9 July 2004. pp. 44-45 Psagot Winery The Psagot Winery was founded by Na‚Äôama and Yaakov Berg, who started to plant vineyards either in 1998,Where you stand changes the view, Haaretz or 2002. Berg, who immigrated to Israel from the Soviet Union, is the CEO.David Kattenburg, 'Inside the mind of an Israeli settler,' Mondoweiss 13 November 2019. According to the Independent, in 2007 the Falic family of Florida, who own Duty Free America, purchased 32,000 shares in Psagot winery for 4.1 million shekels, becoming majority shareholders and directors. In addition to a modern barrel cellar, some of the oak barriques are stored in a cave dating back to the Second Temple era. The winery's top wine is a Bordeaux blend named Edom. Regular varietal wines are produced in the Psagot series and there is also a Port-style wine. In 2007 and 2008, the winery produced 65,000 bottles annually. In 2010, the winery produced 80,000 bottles of wine a year, the majority for export. By 2015, the number produced had grown to 250,000 bottles per year, of which 65% are exported. Palestinian Arabs and Israeli Jews work there side by side which, according to Akiva Novick, creates an island of co-existence in sea of mistrust.Peace with a paycheck, YNET, by Akiva Novick, 08.25.10‚ÄòBlessings of Israel‚Äô: Settlers find new ways to label products after E.U. decision The American evangelical Christian organization HaYovel has sent volunteers to tend and harvest Psagot Winery's vineyards. Non-Jews are not allowed to work in the vineyard itself, for kosher reasons. Berg says calls to boycott his wines have only increased demand. The winery has developed into \\"a favourite destination\\" for right-wing Israeli and American politicians. Other wineries exist around Psagot, and the Yesha Council hopes to make them a tourist attraction. According to the local Palestinians and the Israeli human rights group Yesh Din, the wineries are partially planted on privately owned Palestinian land. \\"Israeli officials\\" confirmed that the Berg house lies atop a quarter hectare of privately owned Palestinian land; in 2003 a demolition order (COGAT Order 252/03) was issued by the Israeli occupation authorities against Mr Berg‚Äôs home as, even under Israeli law, his decision to build on the privately owned land is illegal. As of June, 2019, the order has yet to be enforced. Writing in November 2019, Gideon Levy and Alex Levac noted: > \\"The land is owned by Palestinians, with documents to prove it ‚Äì but is now > the site of a Jewish winery.\\"[..] \\"This is the estate of Yaakov Berg, CEO of > the Psagot winery, in the central West Bank.

On 12 November 2019 the Court of Justice of the European Union in a ruling covering all territory Israel captured in the 1967 war decided that labels on foodstuffs must not imply that goods produced in occupied territory came from Israel itself and must \\"prevent consumers from being misled as to the fact that the State of Israel is present in the territories concerned as an occupying power and not as a sovereign entity\\". In its ruling, the court said that failing to inform EU consumers they were potentially buying goods produced in settlements denies them access to \\"ethical considerations and considerations relating to the observance of international law\\". The Winnipeg Jewish university instructor David Kattenburg has won a similar judgement in a Canadian court against the fraudulent branding of settlement wines for export, naming the Psagot products on sale in his country.Brennan Doherty, 'Man challenges CFIA ruling that West Bank wines are 'products of Israel' CBC 8 August 2017.

Purpose and type An online art gallery is a website that display artworks. Usually, the online gallery is run as a business, with the purpose of displaying the artwork being to promote it to potential buyers. Other variations include: * An online art market for collectors also known as an online secondary market. * A contemporary art gallery displaying art work from their current, future, or past exhibitions, most often to promote the exhibitions, rather than with a view to selling the work via the website . * An artist hosting their own gallery, either on their own website or on other websites. This approach is usually adopted with a view to increasing the percentage of the sale price the artist themselves receive. * There are a number of online galleries that represent many artists working in different media and genre. The artist either pays a monthly fee or agrees to a commission paid when the work is sold. These are usually non-exclusive and are therefore a risk free opportunity for the artist to sell their work worldwide. They can be found by using search terms such as \\"original art\\" or \\"online art gallery\\". Viewing art online Viewing art online is an improving experience. Ideally, art should appear exactly as it would if seen in the real world, but there are factors that limit the extent to which this is possible. Factors include: * Whether or not natural lighting can be approximated * The extent to which a viewer is able to see the art from various angles i.e. other than head-on * The impact on art that uses layering or raised effects when it is not viewable as a three-dimensional object The increased adoption of broadband, and improvement in web programming techniques opens up the opportunity for improved display of art online. Whilst no online gallery yet uses light filtering effects, and 3d photography is not yet available, much richer images and improved display techniques provide the viewer with a much richer experience. The viewer may be offered the option of zooming such that the texture or pigmentation may be examined. Also in some cases the size of the work can be better appreciated by showing it alongside an image of a person of average height. Another advantage of Online Galleries is that the art buying public is broadening but people are still somewhat intimidated by most commercial Art Galleries. They think they know nothing about art and I believe that in some cases this disadvantages the sales of some artists.

For ever and ever) is an Israeli outpost in the West Bank. It is near Shvut Rachel and Qusra and falls under the jurisdiction of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council. A resident of Adei Ad says that the outpost includes about 40 families. Adei Ad gained international attention in January 2015, when residents allegedly engaged in throwing rocks at a delegation from the U.S. embassy.\\"Dan Williams 'Israeli settlers stone U.S. diplomatic cars: police' (2 Jan 2015) Reuters\\" https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/02/us- mideast-israel-usa-settlement-idUSKBN0KB0WX20150102 The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. History Adei Ad was established in 1998 by a group of students at the Sdot Amir yeshiva in Shvut Rachel. It is named after a Bible verse from Psalm 132:14: \\"This is my resting place for ever and ever.\\" In 1999 Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak ordered the outpost dismantled. It was established on land privately owned by Palestinians and was therefore considered illegal even under Israeli law, although the ownership was disputed by the settlers. In 2003 the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled that the land was owned by the state of Israel. The Israeli government, however, claimed that, despite its being state-owned, the settlers had no right to build there. In June 2003 the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) deployed paratroopers to blockade Adei Ad while it was dismantled. An IDF officer asked to be excused from participating in the blockade and was advised by his commanding officer that he could participate indirectly by briefing other soldiers involved in the operation. He refused this order as well and was subsequently jailed. The High Court of Justice temporarily enjoined this dismantling operation and Binyamin Regional Council leader Pinhas Wallerstein accused the Israeli government of scheduling the dismantling of the outpost to coincide with a visit to Israel of U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in order to show its commitment to the ongoing peace process. Israeli news sources reported in 2003 that although the Israeli government was following its policy of dismantling them, it was simultaneously funding the construction of illegal outposts, including Adei Ad. Adei Ad was the beneficiary of agricultural aid from Mishmeret Yesha, which by 2008 had cleared large areas of land around the outpost and planted thousands of dunams of grapevines. In July 2008 soldiers from the IDF demolished an illegal structure in Adei Ad. This led to retaliatory attacks on the IDF by settlers, which prompted the IDF Central Command to prohibit Israeli cars from entering parts of the West Bank for two days to prevent militant right-wing Israelis from joining in the violence. The IDF accused the then mayor of Kedumim, Daniella Weiss, of orchestrating and encouraging the settler violence. In July 2009 soldiers from the IDF demolished a single caravan in Adei Ad, prompting settlers from Kedumim to attack the IDF with stones, injuring one. Five settlers were arrested in this incident. Retaliation for the home demolitions continued with further incidents of rock throwing and the burning of Palestinian-owned olive trees. In January 2015, settlers at what Haaretz referred to as the Adei Ad \\"illegal outpost\\"\\"Chaim Levinson 'Settlers throw stones at U.S. consulate convoy in West Bank' (2 Jan 2015) Haaretz\\" http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.635066 threw stones at diplomats from a U.S. delegation who had arrived to inspect vandalism reported at a grove of Palestinian-owned trees in the occupied West Bank. It was reported that Jewish settlers from the outpost were suspected of uprooting thousands of olive tree saplings, some of which had been planted in honor of senior Palestinian official Ziad Abu Ein, who collapsed and died after an altercation with an Israeli soldier. The American consulate came to inspect the grove because some of the land owners claim U.S. citizenship.\\"Dan Williams 'American Diplomatic Convoy Stoned by Jewish Settlers on West Bank' The Jewish Daily Forward (2 Jan 2015)\\"http://forward.com/articles/211997/american-diplomatic-convoy-stoned-by- jewish-settle/\\"Peter Beaumont 'Israeli settlers stone two cars belonging to US consulate staff' (1 Jan 2015) The Guardian\\" https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/02/israeli-settlers-stone-two-cars- us-consulate-staff This is the first known physical attack by Israelis against American diplomatic staff.

Greek-controlled companies have invested US$5 billion in the Nigerian economy. There is a small Greek business community in Lagos. Official relations Greece and Nigeria enjoyed close ties before the Nigerian military regime took power in December 1983. In February 2000, the Nigerian embassy in Greece was re-established after a 16-year absence. Relationships between the countries are now generally good. On March 25, 2009, the outgoing Greek Ambassador to Nigeria, Haris Dafaranos, stated that Greece would continue to explore new areas of cooperation and boost cultural, economic, scientific and technological ties with Nigeria. This was confirmed when, on 22 April 2009, Greek Deputy FM Petros Doukas and visiting Nigerian Commerce and Industry Minister Charles Ugwuh signed a bilateral agreement in the economic, scientific and technology sectors. Ugwuh said \\"it is important, following a century of transactions between Greece and Nigeria, that an official agreement (on cooperation) was signed today\\". The two countries are discussing partnership in the development of the Free Trade Zones in Nigeria. Trade and investment With the return to democracy in 2000, trade between the two countries is growing fast. The Hellenic African Chamber of Commerce and Development holds annual conferences where Greek businesses involved in African trade discuss opportunities with ministers and delegations from Nigeria and other countries. By 2003 Greek exports to Nigeria totalled US$46.5 million, with imports totaling US$5.4 million. By 2005, Greece exports had risen to ‚Ç¨65.7 million, with imports of ‚Ç¨20.2 million. Greek investments in Nigeria today exceed US$5 billion, and are growing. For example, in 2005 the Greek owned Flour Mills of Nigeria announced an investment of US$350 million to create a cement factory in Calabar. Estimated project costs have risen and are now in excess of US$500 million According to a report on \\"Trafficking in Persons\\" issued by the United States Department of State in 2008, Nigerian women and girls are trafficked to Europe for the purposes of forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation, most notably to Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Norway, and Greece. Approximately 10% of prostitutes in Greece are estimated to be from Nigeria, most of whom are victims of the slave trade. Shipping Greek tanker Montego In 2007 Nigeria had about 8.3% of the world market in natural gas exports, and was exporting about of oil using tankers, although volumes have been declining due to civic unrest and reduced demand. As of 2007, Greek-owned companies owned about 18% of the world fleet. The ships are registered under a variety of flags, including \\"flags of convenience\\", but with changing regulations an increasing number of Greek- owned tankers are registered under the Greek flag. There are issues concerning the safety of Greek / Nigeria shipping. In November, 2008 the captain of an impounded Greek oil tanker accused Nigeria's armed forces of co-operating with militants in the Niger Delta to hijack his ship. The captain claimed that the militants had forced his crew at gun-point to load smuggled oil while three Nigerian naval gunboats looked on. Nigeria denied the allegation. Thirteen Filipino crew members of the oil tanker were arrested by the Nigerian government on suspicion of stealing thousands of tons of crude oil. Following kidnappings and other problems with workers on Greek vessels in the Nigerian coastal trade, the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration has issued warnings to Filipino seafarers working on such vessels. Movement of people=Greeks in Nigeria Large Greek-owned companies have been operating in Nigeria for decades, such as the Mandilas Group, Nigeria Flour Mills and the Anglo-Hellenic multinational Patterson-Zochonis. The Leventis Group of Companies, trading in merchandise in West Africa, was founded in the 1930s by the Cypriot Anastasios George Leventis. By the time of his death in October 1978 it was one of the largest enterprises and one of the two largest employers in Nigeria. The Leventis Foundation, established by A.G. Leventis, has been active since 1979 with its main goal the training of young farmers in modern agricultural methods. There were more than 10,000 Greeks living and working in Nigeria before the Nigerian military regime took power in December 1983, many of whom left the country. Today the Greek Diaspora in Nigeria numbers about 300 mostly residing in Lagos and working as company executives in large Greek-Nigerian companies. A Greek Orthodox holy bishopric operates in Nigeria, based in Lagos. Nigerians in Greece In 2001 there were about 3,000 Nigerians in Greece, about half of whom live in Athens. Some came to Greece as university students, while others are economic migrants. The Nigerian Community of Greece (NCG) organization was created in 1990 to help new Nigerian immigrants gain legal status, and to provide a social network for Nigerian residents. Famous Hellenized-Nigerians include NBA basketball player Giannis Antetokounmpo, along with his brothers Thanasis and Kostas, who are currently playing in the United States.

MIPS is structured in such a way as to make payments on the security an interest expense for the borrower and dividend for the lender. A special purpose entity of the issuer sells the preferred stock to the public and then lends the proceeds to the parent. The parent's interest payments to the subsidiary are tax-deductible as interest and are used by the SPE to pay preferred dividends to the investors. However, the interest income received by the SPE is not taxable income, because it is organized as a tax-free entity. Because of these features, MIPS at one point dominated the market for traditional perpetual preferred equity, accounting for over 70% of all new preferred issues. However, MIPS as a tax shelter no longer works. The credit rating agencies consider MIPS to be preferred stock.

The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. History Mitzpe Hagit was founded in early 1999. It began with only two wooden caravans on a hill from Kfar Adumim. On October 12, 1999, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced that Mitzpe Hagit was one of 15 outposts in the West Bank that he planned to have dismantled, on the recommendation of the Israeli Defense Ministry. Barak gave the residents 14 hours to appeal. In November 1999, Pinhas Wallerstein, head of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, said that residents of Mitzpe Hagit would voluntarily leave the site until the outpost was officially authorized by the Israeli government. By the end of December 1999 Mitzpe Hagit had been removed. Peace Now issued a report claiming that the Israeli government had approved new caravans there and in other dismantled outposts. The organization stated that this \\"testified to the continuation of under-the-table doings in everything linked to building in the settlements.\\" Ephraim Sneh, Deputy Defense Minister at the time, said that his office was not planning to approve any building permits and that \\"[Neveh] ErezNeveh Erez and Hagit were removed; they can submit plans to build but it doesn't mean anything. Therefore the movement shouldn't confuse the public.\\" By October 2000 settlers had returned to Mitzpe Hagit. There were again two caravans and the population was 8 adults and 4 children. Shimon and Chaya Ben Dor, who had been among the original founders, claimed that their return had the approval of Ehud Barak. Israeli officials, though, were unsure if this was true.

The academy was established in 1948 and was named after the painter Jan van Eyck. In 2013, 39 researches from countries around the world were working and studying at the institutes premises in Jekerkwartier. In 2012, the Hubert van Eyck Academie / Caterina van Hemessen Academie was established as a ‚Äòteaching bridge,‚Äô linking the Jan van Eyck Academie / Margaret van Eyck Academie with Maastricht University and other Maastricht art schools. History=Beginnings (1947‚Äì1949) In 1928 the priest Leo Linssen, the architect Alphons Boosten and the artist-writer Jan Engelman discussed the state of art in the province of Limburg, and the need for an art academy in the south of the Netherlands based on Roman Catholic principles. However, their ideas did not materialize at the time. Nearly two decades later, in December 1947, the Saint Bernulphus Foundation succeeded in establishing an institute for advanced education in fine art based on Catholic principles in Maastricht. The institute is named after the painter Jan van Eyck, born in Maaseik, not far from Maastricht, and considered a suitable role model for Catholic artists. The academy in Maastricht was originally conceived as a Catholic counterpart of the non-denominational Rijksakademie in Amsterdam, founded in 1870. The institute's main objectives were to further and expand art education in the broadest sense of the word, although the deed also clearly stipulated that the students should be trained in their art practice for tasks in the service of the Catholic Church, which involved the reconstruction, restoration and decoration of churches destroyed in the war. The academy was established as a private institute, subsidized by the state, the province of Limburg and local authorities. On 13 May 1948, the feast of patron saint Servatius of Maastricht, the founding charter was signed by representatives of the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, the Province of Limburg, the city of Maastricht, and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Roermond. This day has ever since been observed as the academy's dies natalis. Classes started on 1 October 1948 with seven students enrolled; their numbers increased to fifteen in the course of the first academic year. Compulsory subjects included the history of art, iconography, theology and philosophy, liturgy, sources of Christian art, history of civilization and literature. However, the statement of principles stressed that contemporary art was vital as well to the academy's set-up. In November 1948, the priest Leo W. Linssen was assigned first director of the Jan van Eyck Academie. Linssen, in his opening speech referred to Van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece as an example of 'Christian art'. The Jan van Eyck Academie initially took up residence in the former Sepulchrine church and convent (Bonnefantenklooster) in the Jekerkwartier neighbourhood in the center of Maastricht. The rather derelict building with sparse natural light was shared with several other institutions. In 1949 the board decided that, as an applied art institution, the academy should incorporate the training of architects. Consequently, three curricula were set up: architecture, sculpture and fine art (i.e. monumental and decorative painting). Belgian sculptor Oscar Jespers was professor of sculpting (1949‚Äì56). Classes of theory, aesthetics and technical education ‚Äì with a firm scientific basis ‚Äì were compulsory. There were studios for ceramics and glass art, mosaics, plaster casting and goldsmithing. In 1951 the Jan van Eyck Academie moved to a 17th-century orphanage in Lenculenstraat (later to house the Maastricht Academy of Dramatic Arts). Identity building (1950‚Äì1967) On 21 July 1952 the first group of 15 students graduated. In 1954, professor J.J.M. Timmers, an eminent art historian and director of the Bonnefanten Museum, was appointed the academy's second director. His major task was to find the academy a new, suitable building, as well as to bring the academy up to equal level with the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam. Consultations concerning the latter soon ran aground because the board of governors insisted on the Jan van Eyck Academie remaining a private institute, based on catholic principles. Plans for a new building, designed by Modernist architect Frits Peutz were presented and approved. In June 1959 construction work began and in January 1961 staff and students moved into the new building ‚Äì a building however that was but a third of the size of Peutz' original plan. In 1965, Timmers resigned as director and was succeeded by Albert Troost. Teaching and advising staff by that time had changed considerably; ties with the Roman Catholic establishment had become looser and catholic principles were only moderately adhered to. Troost, together with Ko Sarneel, visited art institutes of higher education in Amsterdam, Antwerp, D√ºsseldorf and Brussels and studied their educational programs and methods. The two men drew a master plan that emphasized the Maastricht academy's need for a clear statement of principles and a well-founded program. Education from now on was to match developments in contemporary art practices. Education was restricted to fine art; architecture was no longer part of the curriculum. Entry requirements became more rigid, a fact-finding year was introduced, and more visiting lecturers were employed. The new adage was that art education should be more individually directed: the student, his consciousness and questions were to feature centrally. When in 1966 the Dutch Minister of Culture, Maarten Vrolijk, opened a new wing adjacent to the existing building, he praised the Academie for being outstandingly fitted out: there was a studio for metal working, a welding workshop, a carving studio, a foundry for bronze molding, a pottery kiln and means were provided to work with new synthetic materials. Goal setting (1968‚Äì1979) The Jan van Eyck Academie's third decade brought about some dramatic changes. Subsidies had gradually increased over the years and there was more room for education, research and experiment. The departments of monumental art and applied art closed. Society had become more secular and there was less demand for stained-glass windows, murals and mosaics (mainly for churches). In order for the students to be trained as all- round experts in fine art, divisions between various disciplines were abolished. In 1969 the departments of theater, design and mixed media were set up. These were multi-disciplinary departments and as such perfectly tied in with the idea of doing away with divisions between disciplines. Students of the mixed media department could make use of the timber workshop, the welding shop, the photo studio, the darkrooms, the silk-screen print shop, the audio and video studio, and the foundry to produce a single work of art, an installation, a performance or an action. In the 1970s the idea took ground that an art institute should be a breeding ground for research and experiment, a sanctuary of innovation. After 1978, the institute, rather than a place of instruction, saw itself as a platform or workshop ('werkplaats'): a center where works of art are being manufactured, as well as a place for discussion, study and experiment. Accommodation, equipment, expert supervision and coaching were aimed to trigger new developments. Extra-curricular activities, work placements in the art milieu, and other projects reached beyond the Academie's community. Internationalization (1980s) In 1980, Ko Sarneel, became acting director and proposed a 5-year plan, which entailed an increase in the scope and quality of projects and manifestations for the public at large. Visual token of Sarneel's term of office are the round holes that still mark the building today. The artist John K√∂rmeling, alumnus of Eindhoven University of Technology, transformed the building into an 'art factory' for twenty-four hours. The ribs and diagonals of this imaginary building were visualized within and through the existing one by means of laser beams that concurred high up in the sky. Two years later, Ko Sarneel resumed his previous function as head of the mixed media department, and William Pars Graatsma became director. During his directorship the photography section became autonomous and an audio room and video studio were set up. In 1980 Scottish video pioneer Elsa Stansfield was asked to create a Time Based Media Department at the Jan van Eyck Academy, Maastricht. This was the first media department in a postgraduate academy in the Netherlands. She also started to build a video collection for the Academy. When the Jan van Eyck Academie celebrated its 40th anniversary in 1988, architects Wiel Arets and Wim van den Bergh were asked by Mr Graatsma to translate the policy plan of the academy into architectural terms. 'Macchina Arte' was the name for the architectonic concept that was about a complex set of thoughts that converged in the concept of 'machine'. By this time, the Jan van Eyck Academie had truly become an international platform for art. The majority of advising researchers and students were from abroad and English had become the language of communication. Three disciplines (1990s) The 1991 policy plan of the academy's new director Jan van Toorn described the Jan van Eyck Academie as an international post-graduate art center with three disciplines: fine art, design and art theory. During this period individual freedom, discourse and the wider cultural context were emphasized. The horizontal organizational structure of the institute ensured mutual interchange and interaction in the disciplines of architecture, sculpture, photography, graphics, painting, video-audio and mixed media. The Jan van Eyck Academie in the 1990s can be described as a venue for practical and theoretical reflection on art and society that went beyond generally accepted values. 'Researchers' (no longer students!) were expected to have attained a practical and theoretical level that allowed them to make contributions to discussions, to do research and to engage in multi- and trans-disciplinary activities. In 1992 a computer workshop was set up and in 1995 the Jan van Eyck Academie was connected to the internet. By this time, there were seven professional technical studios/workshops in the building: the audio and video studios, the computer workshop, the print shop, the photo studio, and workshops for graphics, wood and other materials. The media center, including the library and archives, was enlarged. New research programs were set up (Transcultural Studies and Design & Media). In 1998 Marianne Brouwer, former curator of sculpture of the Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum, was appointed director. In the autumn of 1999 Simon den Hartog, former director of the Gerrit Rietveld Academie and founder of the Sandberg Institute, became acting director. Sue Golding was head of the Art Theory department from 1998 to 2003. Post-academic institute (2000‚Äìnow) In 2000 Koen Brams was appointed director of the Jan van Eyck Academie. The institute's program, as indicated in the policy plan, was described as the sum of all research and production undertaken. A new artistic advisory structure was introduced: advising researchers of the three departments (fine art, design and art theory) carry out departmental tasks together. In every department a core team of advising researchers is active. They initiate and supervise research projects, but their tasks also include programming, selection, studio visits, lectures, seminars, presentations and institutional and policy matters. Since 2001 the academy's weekly program is accessible to the public; opening up the institute has invited more critical response. The Jan van Eyck Academie today sees itself as a hotbed for talent development. Essential in the new organization is that the institute is an open meeting place for people: artists, thinkers, readers, curators, writers, designers, poets, dreamers, workers, and occasional passers-by. The institute offers high-standard artistic and technical advice in response to individual requirements. Researchers are invited to theorize, formulate and produce. Hallmark of research is its discursive character. The institute offers alternative views of research and production, for which a climate of involvement is paramount in which researchers, artistic and technical staff establish alliances, collaborations and networks that are both practical and conceptual. Researchers can make use of the facilities (‚ÄòLabs‚Äô) inside the institute: the Charles Nypels Lab / Anne P√©tronille Nypels Lab (print workshop), the Heimo Lab / Luzia Hartsuyker-Curjel Lab (wood and metal workshop), the Werner Mantz Lab / Elsa Stansfield Lab (multimedia workshop), the Pierre Kemp Lab / Th√©r√®se Cornips Lab (library and archives), the Jac. P. Thijsse Lab / Wilhelmina Minis-van de Geijn Lab (nature research), and the Food Lab. After extensive renovations, the renewed building was reopened on March 27, 2013, and the institution was restructured by director Lex ter Braak: Under the umbrella term ‚ÄúVan Eyck‚Äù Jan van Eyck Academie / Margaret van Eyck Academie and Hubert van Eyck Academie / Caterina van Hemessen Academie as well as the (then five) Labs were integrated. In April and May 2017, female names were officially added to the all-male names of the Van Eyck‚Äôs two academies and its five Labs. As of October 1, 2018, curator Hicham Khalidi serves as director of Van Eyck. Hubert van Eyck Academie / Caterina van Hemessen Academie On 25 January 2012, the Hubert van Eyck Academie was established as a post-academic institution aiming to develop teaching facilities in partnership with the faculty of Cultural and Social Sciences of Maastricht University and three Maastricht branches of Hogeschool Zuyd (Zuyd University of Applied Sciences): the Maastricht Academy of Dramatic Arts, the Maastricht Academy of Music and the Maastricht Academy of Fine Arts. Hubert van Eyck was Jan‚Äôs elder brother and taught Jan how to use oil-based paint. Just as research and education went together in their case, the Jan and Hubert van Eyck Academies are striving for the same objective. The Jan van Eyck Academie stands for project development, the Hubert van Eyck Academie for teaching. Through the Hubert van Eyck Academie it will be possible to set up PhD tracks for artists, in partnership with the European Graduate School in Saas Fee (Switzerland). The collaboration between the various Maastricht art schools has already resulted in the I-Arts program of Maastricht University. In 2012, two I-Arts masters students spent a year at the Jan van Eyck Academie. In May 2017, the alternative name Caterina van Hemessen Academie was added, paying homage to the homonymous Flemish Renaissance painter.

Raimondo di Sangro, Prince of Sansevero Early life The seventh Prince of San Severo was born at Torremaggiore into a noble family. His father was Antonio, Duke of Torremaggiore, and his mother was Cecilia Gaetani of Aragon. His mother died shortly after his birth. From the age of ten he was educated at the Jesuit College in Rome. Career In 1730, at the age of 20, he returned to Naples. He became a friend of Charles Bourbon, who became king of Naples in 1734, for whom he invented a waterproof cape. In 1744 he distinguished himself at the head of a regiment during the Battle of Velletri, in the war between the Habsburgs and the Bourbons. While in command of the military he built a cannon out of lightweight materials which had a longer range than the standard ones of the time, and wrote a military treatise on the employment of infantry (Manuale di esercizi militari per la fanteria) for which he was praised by Frederick II of Prussia. His real interests, however, were the studies of alchemy, mechanics and the sciences in general. Among his inventions were: * An hydraulic device that could pump water to any height * An \\"eternal flame\\", using chemical compounds of his own inventionRaimondo di Sangro (translated from the French by Elita Serrao), Il lume eterno (from Dissertation sur un Lampe antique trouv√© √† Munich en l'ann√©e 1753. Ecrite par M.r le Prince de St. Severe pour servir de fluite a la pr√©mi√®re partie de ses Lettres √† M.r l'Abb√© Nollet √† Paris), Bastogi 1993 (in Italian). * A carriage with wood and cork \\"horses\\" which, driven by a cunning system of paddlewheels, could travel on both land and waterLa Gazzetta di Napoli, 24 July 1770 * Coloured fireworks * A printing press which could print different colours in a single impression. Publishing The Prince spoke several European languages, as well as Arabic and Hebrew. After returning to Naples he set up a printing press in the basement of his house where he printed both his own works and those of others, some of which he translated himself. As some of these were censored by the ecclesiastical authorities he also wrote anonymously. Some of his publications were clearly influenced by Freemasonry, and he communicated with fellow masons such as the Scot Andrew Michael Ramsay,G.D. Henderson: \\"Chevalier Ramsay\\" Thomas Nelson and Sons London,1952 whose Voyages of Cyrus he translated and published, and the English poet Alexander Pope, whose Rape of the Lock he translated and published (although, due to condemnations by the Jesuits, he had to deny these activities). He was head of the Neapolitan masonic lodge until he was excommunicated by the Church, making an enemy of the Neapolitan cardinal Giuseppe Spinelli. The excommunication was later revoked by Pope Benedict XIV, probably on account of the influence of the di Sangro family. Whilst in Naples, he forged a friendship with Fortunato- Bartolommeo de F√©lice, 2nd Count di Panzutti, who had been appointed chair of experimental physics and mathematics at Naples University by Celestino Galiani and later set up the famous publishing press at Yverdon in 1762. Together the Prince and the Count translated the physicist John Arbuthnot's works from Latin. Rumours Many legends grew up around his alchemical activities: that he could create blood out of nothing, that he could replicate the liquefaction of blood of San Gennaro, that he had people killed so that he could use their bones and skin for experiments. The Chapel of Sansevero was said to have been constructed on an old temple of Isis, and di Sangro was said to have been a Rosicrucian. To justify this, locals pointed to a massive Statue of the God of the Nile, located just around the corner from his home. To add to the sense of dread, di Sangro's family home in Naples, the Palazzo Sansevero, was the scene of a brutal murder at the end of the 16th century, when the composer Carlo Gesualdo caught his wife and her lover in flagrante delicto, and hacked them to death in their bed.Il Mattino newspaper, Naples, Italy, 28 December 2008 Later life The last years of his life were dedicated to decorating the Chapel of Sansevero with marble works from the greatest artists of the time, including Antonio Corradini, Francesco Queirolo, and Giuseppe Sanmartino (whose Veiled Christ's detailed marble veil was thought by many to be created by di Sangro's alchemy) and preparing anatomical models. Two of the models, known as anatomical machines, are still on display in the Chapel, and have given rise to legends as to how they were constructed (even today the exact method is not known). Until recently many Neapolitans believed that the models were of his servant and a pregnant woman, into whose veins an artificial substance was injected under pressure, but the latest research has shown that the models are artificial. He destroyed his own scientific archive before he died. After his death, his descendants, under threat of excommunication by the Church due to di Sangro's involvement with Freemasonry and alchemy, destroyed what was left of his writings, formulae, laboratory equipment and results of experiments. Death Raimondo di Sangro died in Naples in 1771, his death being hastened by the continuous use of dangerous chemicals in his experiments and inventions. In 1794, the Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg named the plant genus Sansevieria after him.

Early life Outside the affairs of parliament, little is known of Doreward. He was apparently the son of William Doreward of Bocking, Essex who was a member of parliament for Essex in the eighteenth and twentieth parliaments of Edward III.Round, J.

Among its purposes was to pray for the soul of John Doreward, the founder's father.'Hospitals: Bocking', in A History of the County of Essex: Volume 2 (1907), p. 183 online at british-history.ac.uk, accessed 11 August 2008 Political life Doreward was appointed High Sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire for 1399 and elected knight of the shire (MP) six times for Essex (1395, Jan 1397, 1399, Jan 1404, May 1413 and April 1414). He was elected Speaker of the House in 1399 and 1413. The Constitutional History of England in its Origin and Development, vol. III, p. 18 ... In the case of Sir John Cheyne, the Speaker elected in 1399, the excuse of ill-health was accepted by the king as valid; the clergy had in fact objected to the nomination; Sir John Cheyne withdrew, and John Doreward was chosen in his place.Stubbs p. 454 The chronicler Robert Fabyan, writing about a hundred years after Doreward's first election as Speaker, gives a more obscure version of events: The Parliament was almost identical in makeup to the previous parliament held under Richard II, where thanks to the political manoeuvring of Sir John Bussy many of Parliament's powers had been stripped from them and given instead to a committee. The summoning of this parliament showed good political judgement on the part of the de facto king, Henry IV; in the words of Manning \\"[Henry] could not have hoped to assemble a body of legislators less favourable to the captive monarch\\" The Commons voted a large subsidy to pay for the war against Scotland and the defence of Ireland and Calais in the hopes that their requests for additional powers would be granted. The commons also voted for the arrest of William Scrope and Henry Green, both councillors of Richard II. Doreward was again made Speaker of the House of Commons for the parliament of 1413; this was the first of Henry V, and he was appointed again apparently after his predecessor had resigned from ill-health. The parliament of 1413 granted Henry V a subsidy for four years; an unusually long period, this is understood to be explained by the new king's popularity. Some historians have assumed that the John Doreward (or Dorewood) in the parliaments of 1399 and 1413 were father and son, but they are evidently the same person; the Speaker of the House of Commons in both cases was a serjeant- at-law, which was not an appointment held by either of Dorewood's sons. He was appointed a member of Henry IV's council from Nov 1399 to May 1406. Monument Doreward is commemorated by a monumental brass in St Mary's Church, Bocking, on the floor before the South Chapel. This gives the year of his death as 1420 and names his second wife as Isabella.History at stmarys- bocking.co.uk, accessed 11 August 2008 Inscribed in Latin: Exoretur mia(?)

It is the administrative centre of Treklyano Municipality, which lies in the northwestern part of Kyustendil Province. The village is located in the Kraishte area, very close to the Serbian border and not far from the North Macedonia border. It is situated 40 kilometres north of the provincial capital of Kyustendil, 39 kilometres south of Tran and 100 kilometres west of the capital Sofia. Treklyano lies in an isolated valley at the foot of the 1,733-metre Milevets peak in the border mountain of Milevska Planina. The Treklyano River, which runs through the village, flows into the Struma River at Zemen. The first reference to the village is in an early 15th-century Bulgarian text: —†–¢ –°–Ñ–õ–û –¢–†–ò–ö–õ–ò–ù–û. It was also mentioned in Ottoman tax registers of 1570-1572 as Predoshnitsa or Preglino and a few years later, in 1576-1577, it was listed as Terklyane. According to popular etymology, the old village name was Tri Klena (\\"Three maple trees\\"), as there was an area near the village where three maple trees were located. Linguists suggest a derivation from *traklo, itself from trak (\\"tie, belt\\") or from Greek œÑœÅŒØ-Œ∫ŒªŒπŒΩŒøœÇ, \\"three-bedded\\", referring to stream beds. There is an area near the village where two rivers merge to make up a third one, i.e. forming three beds. During the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria, the village has been abandoned and reestablished several times. There was an influx of settlers during the First Serbian Uprising of 1804, the Second Serbian Uprising of 1815-1817 and after the newly liberated Principality of Serbia included some then-Bulgarian-populated areas in 1831-1833. The first school in the village was a monastery school founded in 1853, while a secular school was opened 10 years later. A new Bulgarian Orthodox church dedicated to the Dormition of the Theotokos was built in 1860 at the place of an older church. After the Liberation of Bulgaria, Treklyano grew rapidly: at its peak it had up to 800 houses and a population of around 4,000. A community centre (chitalishte) was established in 1901.

Maule was born in Berkswell Parish, Warwickshire, England. He originally emigrated to Barbados around 1658 and later relocated to Boston in 1668 before permanently settling in Salem about 1679. He remained in Salem until his death in 1724 at the age of 79. Maule was a tailor in Boston, and later expanded his business to general merchandising. He also dealt in construction and real estate while in Salem. It is unknown precisely when Maule converted to Quakerism, although it is suspected his conversion happened while he lived in Barbados. Maule's son Thomas was born in 1720 in Salem, apprenticed as a carpenter, and by 1744 relocated with his mother Sarah and her second husband Henry Clifton (m. 1733) to Philadelphia. The Baldwin Genealogy, from 1500 to 1881. Source Information: Ancestry.com. North America, Family Histories, 1500-2000 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2016. Construction of the Quaker Meeting House in Salem During the fall of 1688, Maule was instrumental in building the first known Quaker Meeting House in the United States. He supplied the building materials and land, which he deeded to leaders of the local Society of Friends. Much of the building was constructed using old timber reclaimed from other buildings. The restored Meeting House, reconstructed in 1865 with what is believed to be the building's original beams, is currently located at Peabody Essex Museum in Salem. Criticism of Puritanism and the Salem Witch Trials After settling in Salem in 1668, Maule soon commenced with what would be decades of criticism lobbied toward the Puritan establishment in New England. One of his early criticisms was in 1669 when he made the accusation that Rev. John Higginson, the minister of Salem, \\"preached lies and instructing in the doctrine of devils.\\" The judge ordered for Maule \\"to be whipped ten stripes well laid on.\\" At the time the Salem Witch Trials commenced, Maule believed in witches, and his wife Naomi testified against the woman who would become the first person executed during the trials, Bridget Bishop. However, he grew increasingly dissatisfied with the people of Salem and how the manner in which the trials were conducted. In 1695, several years after the last of the accused were released from custody, Maule published a pamphlet titled Truth Held Forth and Maintained, in which he publicly criticized the Puritan leaders for their gross mismanagement of the Salem Witch Trials. He famously stated \\"[F]or it were better that one hundred Witches should live, than that one person be put to death for a Witch, which is not a Witch\\". Among the points in the pamphlet was his allegation that God would adversely judge the prosecutors of the Salem Witch Trials. In response to this publication, on December 12, 1695, Maule was arrested on charges of slanderous publication about the manner of the untimely death of a prosecutor, Major General Humphrey Atherton, in the trial of Wenlock Christison, who was the last person to be sentenced to death in the Massachusetts Bay Colony for being a Quaker. Maule was also arrested for charges of blasphemy. He was imprisoned for twelve months and his pamphlets were ordered to be burnt. He was eventually tried in 1696 and acquitted of all charges after persuading a Puritan jury to disregard the Court's direction to convict. By granting Maule an acquittal, the jury showed it agreed with his principal argument: The court had no right to suppress his expression of religious belief. His acquittal is considered as one of the most pivotal events leading to the adoption of the First Amendment. After the acquittal, Maule continued writing. Included in his writing are disclosures that he was imprisoned five times, whipped three times, and fined three times. His other known works include: * 1697, New England persecutors mauled with their own weapons; giving some account of the bloody laws made at Boston against the King's subjects, a personal account of his trial in; * 1703, For the service of truth against George Keith, which was a religious pamphlet, and; * date unknown, Letter to Cotton Mather. Popular culture In his novel The House of the Seven Gables, American author Nathaniel Hawthorne based the character of Matthew Maule in part on the real Thomas Maule, as well as others who were wrongfully accused, sentenced and/or executed for witchcraft. The character Colonel Pyncheon, the family elder, is obsessed with purchasing Matthew's property, which has a sweet-water spring. Matthew refuses to sell. Determined to own his neighbor's property, Pyncheon accuses Matthew of witchcraft, for which he is ultimately found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. Maule's garden figures prominently in the novel.

He served in Palestine and Egypt, and joined the British Forces Broadcasting Service in Jerusalem. He later helped start up the BBC Overseas News station in Mombasa, Kenya. After leaving the army he failed to get a job as a BBC Radio announcer, but joined BBC Television as an announcer in March 1952 after a trial at Alexandra Palace, then the base of BBC Television. He joined the team of continuity announcers headed by McDonald Hobley and Sylvia Peters. He went on to present Come Dancing and Picture Parade, a film review programme in 1956 with co-presenter Derek Bond, the actor. In 1958 he provided the BBC commentary for the Eurovision Song Contest, staged that year in Hilversum, Netherlands. He also provided the BBC radio commentary for the contest in 1962. He also presented a number of programmes on the BBC Light Programme including Movie-Go-Round on Sunday afternoons from 1956 to 1969. Although he fitted well into the style of 1950s BBC Television, with the changing style of TV after the introduction of commercial television in 1955, his career declined, and his first marriage broke up. In 1957 he had married the 1950s film star Jill Adams. The couple had a daughter, Peta Louise. From the early '70s he lived in Portugal running a restaurant and bar popular with British tourists, and met his German-born second wife, Inge. They returned to the UK in the 1980s but he could not resume his broadcasting career. He made a final television appearance as guest of Des Lynam on a series called It's My Pleasure.

The species was first described by Adrian Hardy Haworth in 1809. It is found from central and southern Europe, North Africa, Asia Minor to Transcaspia. Description The ground colour is white with strong silky gloss, the lines grey, seldom strongly expressed, on the other hand usually all present, thus numbering five on the forewing and four on the hindwing; the outermost line (distal shading of subterminal) the oftenest absent; all except the median are parallel with the distal margin, but slightly wavy; the median on the forewing is usually somewhat oblique, but occasionally almost parallel with the others; that of the hindwing runs straighter across the wing, instead of following the curve of the strongly convex distal margin. Cellspots and terminal line wanting or rarely the former present, minute; fringe usually with a series of minute black dots at the base, which are sometimes in part, more rarely entirely obsolete. Forewing beneath often with a smoky suffusion, either basally or all over; median and postmedian lines present, often well developed; a small discal dot present. Hindwing beneath white, with discal dot and postmedian line. Male antennal ciliation little longer than diameter of shaft; hindtarsus short. Not on the whole an extremely variable species, except in size; there is, however, a great deal of trivial variation, i.e. as regards the absolute or relative strength of the several lines, the close proximity of the inner subterminal to the postmedian or their wider separation, the degree of suffusion of the under surface, etc. Second-brood specimens, besides being smaller seem to be on an average whiter beneath and are sometimes rounder winged.Prout , L.B. 1912‚Äì16.

He won the 1936 Fronti√®res Grand Prix for sports cars at Chimay, Belgium, and the 1937 Voiturette race at the same event. He also competed in the 1935 and 1937 24 Hours of Le Mans races. In the twenties Hertzberger also did some boxing, while he did a lot of sailing and skiing throughout his life. Hertzberger owned cars like a Bugatti Type 57 Stelvio 4-seater, with which he participated in the 12-hour night drive organised by the KNAC (Royal Dutch Automobile Club) in September 1926, the MG Magnette K3, a 4.5 litre Bentley and an Aston Martin. He restricted his racing to England, France, Italy and Belgium, with motor racing in the Netherlands virtually non-existent, and Jews not allowed to participate in motor racing in Nazi Germany. At Monthl√©ry, Hertzberger managed to break some speed records in his K3. He also started in the Mille Miglia and at Le Mans. He quit racing in 1938 after getting married, although he made a surprise appearance at Zandvoort in 1953. Hertzberger was the first of only two Dutch racing drivers to win races titled 'Grand Prix', the other being Carel Godin de Beaufort, until Max Verstappen won the 2016 Spanish Formula One Grand Prix  Personal life  Hertzberger owned a successful clothing factory in Rotterdam. The factory, including his Bugatti Stelvio #57519 which was parked inside, was completely destroyed at the outbreak of World War II during the bombardment of Rotterdam that prompted the surrender of Holland to the Nazis. Hertzberger escaped the Netherlands through Belgium and France to Switzerland, where he stayed for more than a year. Later he travelled through Vichy France to reach Spain. In Madrid Hertzberger became a member of the intelligence service of the Dutch government, which was based in London during World War II. After the war, Hertzberger rebuilt his factory and lived both in the Netherlands and New York City. Later he moved to Switzerland, where he died in 1993.

We'll Be Right Back!\\" is the twentieth issue of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight series of comic books, a continuation of the television series of the same name. The issue is written by Jeph Loeb, and follows in the style of the undeveloped Buffy the Animated Series spin-off proposed in 2002, on which he worked alongside series creator Joss Whedon. Plot As Buffy slays numerous demons, her thoughts say that she never gets any sleep anymore. When she finally gets a chance to rest (dirty all over and in Xander's bed), Buffy falls asleep while Xander screams for her to get out. Buffy awakes (in an animated style) to her mother's voice telling her she's going to be late for school. Buffy is shocked to hear Joyce and hides her face in her pillow muttering \\"Dream, dream, go away. Come again another... never.\\" Joyce enters her room with a younger Dawn as Buffy jumps from her bed and wraps her arms around Joyce. After moving to hugging Dawn and exclaiming that she isn't a centaur anymore, Joyce goes to leave the room. Buffy stops her and says, \\"I really am happy to see you.\\" Joyce, after checking to see if Buffy has a fever, tells her if she doesn't get a move on, Buffy won't be able to go the party that night. Buffy is surprised to hear that she's going to a party at all. At school, Buffy is surprised to see Willow alive, and back to her Season One self. Cordelia is, of course, making fun of Willow and Buffy steps in, informing Willow that one day she may be a mega-witch and Cordelia might be dead, to which Willow smirks and says, \\"Do I get to wear a pointy hat?\\" Xander comes rushing down the hallway on his skateboard and crashes. Principal Snyder threatens to take his skateboard away. Buffy tells Xander that Snyder might be eaten by a giant snake and that Xander might wear an eyepatch and be in charge of hundreds of hot girls. At that comment, Willow coughs and Buffy remembers that Willow likes Xander and is not aware of her homosexuality. Buffy, Xander, and Willow go looking for Giles. That night, Xander, Buffy, and Willow go to the graveyard and meet Giles who says that \\"the fate of the world is at risk over what happens tonight.\\" Buffy thinks to herself that she remembers this is \\"where [her] life gets in the way of [her] living it.\\" Giles explaining that the disciples of Morgala worship something called Morgala. Buffy brushes off Giles' warning, casual spinning her stake, and says she'll find these disciples. On a two-page spread, Buffy is fighting three disciples of Morgala and slays all of them, with unnecessary commentary by Xander. They return to Giles in the graveyard, planning what they'll do for the party tonight. Giles says the disciples of Morgala were worshiping \\"the image of a dragon\\" to which Buffy responds that she \\"didn't see any dragon.\\" Giles frankly says \\"Buffy, you need to take your role in this more seriously.\\" Buffy, in a fit of rage, explains that she is only trying to have some fun and that someday there will be eighteen hundred slayers and everyone is going to call her \\"ma'am\\" and storms off to the party, leaving Giles speechless. That night in Buffy's home. Buffy puts on the cross Angel gave her and stops to look at it. Joyce comes in to warn Buffy that she doesn't think the party Buffy is going to is going to be safe. Buffy reassures her that everything is going to be okay and hugs her mother. Joyce tells Buffy that she can always come home to which Buffy looks at her mother and says \\"right\\" with her thoughts saying \\"sigh.\\" On the way to the party, Buffy runs into Angel. Angel is impressed that Buffy went up against the five disciples of Morgala. Buffy ignores his comments, touching the side of his face and says \\"If you knew something about someone's past and...future...would you tell them?\\" Angel responds with \\"Probably not. You can't change a person's past. And just by telling them, you'll change their future into who knows what.\\" Buffy says goodbye, and continues on her way to the party. Standing in front of the house, Buffy realizes Angel said five disciples when she only took on three and storms off, hoping to make it back in time for the party. Buffy finds the disciples who conjure up a dragon. Buffy leads it outside, it throws her into the air to which Buffy exclaims that she can see her house from that high. Cordelia, below the dragon and Buffy, trash talks how Buffy didn't even come to the party and Buffy's boot lands on her head. Buffy defeats the dragon by removing a large crystal from its forehead. As Buffy falls to the ground, she wakes up (normal drawing) to Xander screaming for her to get out of his bed. Buffy awakens a bit disoriented. She finds it surprising that Xander has an eyepatch and that Dawn is a centaur and not a robot centaur. She also jumps at Willow calling her \\"You're all gay and magicky now!\\" After calming down she explains to Dawn, Xander, and Willow that she had a dream back in high school. She thought it would have been fun to go back to when times were more simple. But it turns out they were just the same as they are now, only in a different way. In the final panel, Buffy is looking at the reader. The Scoobies (animated style) is behind her, faded slightly. Her voice over says \\"Maybe Angel was right. You can't change a person's past. And just by telling them, you'll change their future into who knows what. But for one brief shiny-shiny, it was great to go home again.\\" Production This issue was written by Jeph Loeb, who worked on the animated series with Joss Whedon. The issue has a link to the animated series and the plot is similar to one partially seen during a promo for the animated series. The issue had some problems at the beginning as artists had to be approved by Sarah Michelle Gellar's representatives, and since there was no official artist working yet, Loeb had not started work on the script as he 'tailors the script around the artist he is working with'. Canonical issues This series has been described as 'canon' by both Whedon and various commentators. As the creator of Buffy, Joss Whedon's association with Buffyverse story is often linked to how canonical the various stories are. Since Whedon is writing this story, it will be seen as a continuation of the official continuity established by Buffy and Angel. Season Eight contradicts and supersedes information given in the paperback novels set after Season Seven, such as Queen of the Slayers and Dark Congress, which are described as being set in an unofficial \\"parallel continuity. Continuity * It is revealed that Buffy and the Scoobies are aware of Cordelia's present- day demise. Timing Season Eight is set after Buffy's seventh season and also after Angel's fifth and Angel: After the Fall. The dream sequence featured is set in Season One after the episode ‚ÄúAngel‚Äù.

Career Heidrich, who played as a goalscoring attacking midfielder, began his career with FC Karl-Marx-Stadt, and quickly became an important first-team player, as the club enjoyed relative success in the late 1980s. He earned one cap for East Germany, as a substitute for Rico Steinmann in a match against Egypt shortly before reunification. He stayed at Chemnitzer FC (as the club was now renamed), playing in the 2. Bundesliga until 1993, when he joined VfB Leipzig, just promoted to the Bundesliga. Heidrich played thirty times in the Bundesliga scoring four goals, as VfB were relegated. He remained with the club for four years, where he was a regular first-team player and a consistent goalscorer. However, they suffered a second relegation in 1998, and Heidrich moved on to FC Energie Cottbus, who had been promoted in their place. He captained Energie to their first ever promotion to the Bundesliga in 2000, but only made two appearances in the top flight, and left at the end of the 2000‚Äì01 season, joining Dynamo Dresden. He helped Dynamo earn promotion to the 2. Liga in 2004, but injury restricted him to just eight appearances, and he retired in 2005.

The Heqanakht papyri or Heqanakht letters (also spelled Hekanakht) are a group of papyri dating to the early Middle Kingdom of Ancient Egypt that were found in the tomb complex of Vizier Ipi. Their find was located in the burial chamber of a servant named Meseh, which was to the right side of the courtyard of Ipi's burial complex. It is believed that the papyri were accidentally mixed into debris used to form a ramp to push the coffin of Meseh into the chamber. The papyri contain letters and accounts written by (or on behalf of) Heqanakht, a ka-priest of Ipi. Heqanakht himself was obliged to stay in the Theban area (probably because of his responsibilities in the necropolis), and thus wrote letters to his family, probably located somewhere near the capital of Egypt at that time, near the Faiyum. These letters and accounts were somehow lost and thus preserved. The significance of the papers is that they give rare and valuable information about lives of ordinary members of the lower upper class of Egypt during this period.  Scholarship  These papyri have been published and discussed several times.J. Cerny, Journal of World History 1 (1954): 903-921; T. G. H. James, The Hekanakht Papers (1962; important review by K. Baer, Journal of the American Oriental Society 83 (1963): 1-19); E. F. Wente, Letters from Ancient Egypt (1990); M. Silver, Economic Structures of Antiquity (1995); J. P. Allen, The Heqanakht Papyri (2002) Cerny and Baer dwelt on economic and social issues, relating to land tenure, land ownership, monetary units and similar topics. Silver discussed macro and micro aspects of the commodity wages paid to estate workers, and other commodity monetary transactions cited in the Heqanakht papers. James and Allen prepared complete translations with commentaries, while Wente offered translations. The materials allowed people to understand both domestic squabbles and household management during that time.  Significance  In the monetary system at the time of the papyri's creation, rent and taxes were generally (but not invariably) paid to Pharaoh in grain. For example, the text reports: In terms of the understanding of what one would call \\"money,\\" Heqanakht clearly calculated values in grain (particularly barley). However, he was able to convert this without difficulties into equivalent values in oil, textiles or copper. He both expected and offered payments in different commodities. For general purposes, however, he only valued new barley himself and was perfectly willing to put his family on short rations in the hope of profit (as Baer noted). On the other hand, however, once a temporary shortage was overcome, he did not view the grain as being particularly valuable: its use value was nil when the family was fed and its exchange value did not exist when his family needed to be fed. For example: \\"Record of the household's incomes: Ipi (jpj) and her servant woman 8 (heqat), Hetepet (Htp.t) and her servant woman 8 (heqat), Heti's (Ht) son Nakht (nxt) together with his dependants 8 (heqat), Merisu (mr.sw) and his dependants 8 (heqat), Sahathor (zA-Hwt-Hr) 8 (heqat), Sanebnut (ZA-nb-n'.t) 7 (heqat), Anpu (jnp) 4 (heqat), Snefru (snfr.w) 4 (heqat), Sa-inut (zA-jnw.t) 4 (heqat), Mai- sa-hetepet (may-zA-Htp.t) 5 (heqat), Nofret (nfr.t) 3¬Ω (heqat), Satwerut (zA.t-wr.wt) (?) 2 (heqat): Total 79¬Ω (heqat)\\"). The papyri are also significant to the study of ancient economic thought, accountancy, and the history of Egyptian fractions and Egyptian multiplication and division. The Akhmim Wooden Tablet, the Egyptian Mathematical Leather Roll, the RMP 2/n table, the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, the Ebers Papyrus and other mathematical texts reported expected and observed Egyptian fractions totals. Totals were written in quotients and scaled/unscaled remainder units. A meta context of the Egyptian Middle Kingdom weights and measures system had empowered one of the earliest Ancient Near East monetary systems. The Egyptian economy was able to double-check its management elements by using double entry accounting, and theoretical or abstract weights and measures units.

Their murders have sparked a diplomatic row between Antigua and the United Kingdom and have resulted in sweeping legislative reform in Antigua. Background Ben Mullany, who was from Ystalyfera, Wales, was training to become a physiotherapist and was in his third year at the University of the West of England (UWE) in Bristol, England. Catherine Mullany, who had grown up a few miles away from her future husband, was a paediatrician training to be a general practitioner. On 12 July 2008, Ben and Catherine married at St John the Evangelist Church in Cilybebyll, Wales. Two days after the marriage, the couple checked into Antigua‚Äôs Cocos Hotel on 14 July 2008. The night before they were to return to the United Kingdom, only two weeks after their wedding, the couple were fatally shot in their cottage during what was thought to be a robbery attempt. Catherine was shot in the head and died instantly. Ben suffered a gunshot wound to the neck. Though he was able to signal and murmur to the paramedics, on the way to the hospital he lapsed into a coma. Ben's parents, who flew to Antigua with Catherine's parents, decided to fly him back to Britain via air ambulance in a last-ditch attempt to save his life. Ben was taken to Morriston Hospital in Swansea, Wales, where his murdered wife, Catherine, had worked. On 3 August 2008, exactly one week after his wife died, following brain stem testing, Ben Mullany died. His life support machines were turned off after doctors told his parents that there was no chance of recovery. The couple were buried together in Cilybebyll. Their funeral was held at Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff, Wales on 10 September 2008. Around 900 people attended including Sarah, Duchess of York. In July 2011, Kaniel Martin and Avie Howell were found guilty of their murders, as well as that of a shopkeeper, Woneta Anderson. Howell was shot dead by police in June 2014 after escaping from jail. Effects=Sweeping legislative reforms in Antigua Antigua Prime Minister Baldwin Spencer, in an attempt to save the island's tourism, is implementing measures in order to increase Antigua's police power including stop-and-search powers for the police, systematic searches of pockets \\"within various communities\\" for guns and drugs, new surveillance cameras and wire-tapping. Spencer has indicated that he is in the process of introducing legislative actions that will make the actions legal and permanent. Additional changes have been made regarding the death penalty, gun trafficking, and assaults with a weapon. \\"Antigua's government will introduce the death penalty for crimes involving weapons in the wake of the murders of a British honeymoon couple. The new sentencing legislation will be for anyone who uses a gun or knife in a crime which results in death or serious injury.\\" The new law also imposes a requirement for judges to hand down a minimum sentence of 25 years in prison and enables judges to ask for a life sentence if need be in cases involving assault with a weapon. Under current law, the death penalty is applied only in murder cases. This legislation will apply it to any crime involving a knife/gun and to gun trafficking. In addition, the previous law required that there be a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison for assault with a weapon. Pending diplomatic row The British government faces a diplomatic row with Antigua over the shooting of the honeymoon couple after demanding that anyone convicted of the crime will not face the death penalty. The British demand to its former colony is understood to have vexed Antigua‚Äôs leadership as Western interference in Antigua‚Äôs police and justice systems is a highly contentious issue in the country. In 2000, the two countries clashed diplomatically after a similar crime in which the United Kingdom tried to stop the execution of Steadroy McDougal for the murder of another British couple. McDougal was eventually reprieved in August 2002. Prime Minister Spencer has also blamed Britain and the United States for the escalating violence in his country, saying that over 280 criminals had been deported to Antigua over the last decade, many of whom had few local ties. \\"To any small island developing state, this figure is astronomically high. In ours, with its small population, these criminal deportees, with skills developed and nurtured in the US and the UK, are impacting tremendously on our society.\\" These remarks have generated great controversy. The Mullany Fund On 5 September 2008, the family and friends of Ben and Cath Mullany launched a memorial fund that will raise money to support British students wishing to study medicine or physiotherapy. The Duchess of York is patron of the charity which is also supported by Sir Vivian Richards.

This book spans events from January to May 1943, during Operation Torch the Allied invasion of Morocco and Algeria and the Tunisia Campaign in World War II. (The preface to the earlier book states this would be a trilogy, but he wrote seven volumes.) As before, the book is in an unusual format freely mixing multimedia formats, with narrative anecdotes, contemporaneous photography, ridiculously non-contemporaneous steel engravings and illustrations, excerpts from diaries, letters and rough sketches, along with absurd memoranda from Nazi officials (sometimes called \\"Hitlergrams\\"). A map is included. In a later volume, Milligan wrote, \\"I wish the reader to know that he is not reading a tissue of lies and fancies, it all really happened\\". In retrospect, the reader is left in some doubt ‚Äì for the Prologue to this volume reads: :\\"I have described nothing but what I saw myself, or learned from others of whom I made the most careful and particular enquiry. ::Thucydides. Peloponnesian War. :I've just jazzed mine up a little. ::Milligan. World War II.\\"Spike Milligan, \\"Rommel?\\" \\"Gunner Who?\\", Michael Joseph Ltd. 1974. p. 11 Some details, such as a facsimile clipping announcing the death of a comrade (an atypical sombre moment in the book) can be assumed factual. Moreover, much other information is apparently intended to be accurate: :\\"Around the main lagoon were dotted smaller lagoons and around the fringe, what appeared to be pink scum. In fact it was hundreds of flamingoes. This vision, the name of Sheba, the sun, the crystal white and silver shimmer of the salt lagoon made boyhood readings of Rider Haggard come alive. It was a sight I can never forget, so engraved was it that I was able to dash it down straight onto the typewriter after a gap of thirty years.\\" On the other hand, speaking of the dedication to \\"brother Desmond who made my boyhood happy\\", Norma Farnes, editor of The Compulsive Spike Milligan said \\"Desmond and I roared with laughter over this fantasy. They used to argue like hell.\\"Norma Farnes, editor, The Compulsive Spike Milligan, Fourth Estate, 2004. p. 185 Summary Milligan's 19 Battery 56th Heavy Rgt. R.A. has arrived in Algeria. With his rank of gunner, there is no one under his command; his promotion later in the book is the source of comment. An officer, Lt. Budden says: \\"Bombardier?\\" He turned and looked out the window. \\"Oh, dear.\\" One of Milligan's first battle encounters is to yell at a passing aeroplane \\"I hope you crash, you noisy bastard!\\" ‚Äî it immediately does. But the plane was Allied. After a couple of weeks they leave the comforts in the area of Cap Matifou, heading east into battle areas, and are now eating army food. Their cook is upper class: :\\"'Where'd you get that accent, Ronnie?'.... :'Eton, old sausage.' :'Well, I‚Äôd stop eatin' old sausages.'\\"Spike Milligan, \\"Rommel?\\" \\"Gunner Who?\\", Michael Joseph Ltd. 1974. p. 48 Milligan stays in various accommodations, from a two-man tent stolen from American supplies (which his best friend Edgington burns down while attacking a scorpion), to appropriated housing. The native Arabs are still in the area. Milligan sneaks food a few times to a farmer whose family is \\"having a rough time\\". Later, they adopt a French dog; when the owner returns to check his house, he mistakenly shoots it; they spend the evening drinking with him in commiseration. As they see action, one gun crew is puzzled to discover their gun is missing after being fired. It's gone over a cliff, and narrowly avoids killing future Goon Harry Secombe, whom Milligan later meets in passing: : \\"I saw something that I felt might put years on the war. It was a short Gunner, wearing iron frame spectacles, a steel helmet that obscured the top of his head, and baggy shorts that looked like a Tea Clipper under full sail....It was my first sight of Gunner Secombe: what a pity! We were so near to Victory, and this had to happen. I hadn't crossed myself in years, and I remember saying, 'Please God...put him out of his misery.'\\" Part of Milligan's job is laying phone lines. On one occasion silence is imperative, since they're close to the enemy, however the hole in the cable drum spool is square, making a great noise as it unreels. :\\"There was a suppressed laughter. Unable to stop it, we all burst out laughing again. :'Stop it at once!' said Dawson, through his own laughter. We stopped. 'Now stop it, or I'll kill the bloody lot of you.' : A white star shell lit the night. :'What's that?' asked Ernie Hart. :'That, Ernie, means that a child has been born in Bethlehem.'\\"Spike Milligan, \\"Rommel?\\" \\"Gunner Who?\\", Michael Joseph Ltd. 1974. p. 67 There's limited time for band music, but Milligan and Edgington play on opposites sides of a bombed out floor. Shortly after Edgington finishes, the piano falls through. Milligan reflects: \\"It's not often we had been detailed to:‚Äî'Clean up that mess of a French Colonial Piano.'\\" While driving with Major Chater Jack: :\\"'How does it go again? called Chater. I re-sang the opening bars with intermittent rain. :'Doesn't he know any other tunes,' said Edward. :\\"'Any others? Christ, he doesn't know this one, he only brings me along as an amanuensis.'\\" Amid Milligan's persistent whistling and joking are moments of reflection: :\\"We sang songs, those nostalgic slushy moon-June love songs that had fucked-up my generation. ... If I sang a song, I was Bing Crosby, if I played trumpet, Louis Armstrong ... but who was I when washing out my socks?\\"Spike Milligan, \\"Rommel?\\" \\"Gunner Who?\\", Michael Joseph Ltd. 1974. pp. 110-1 And, at the end of the book, as the army triumphantly enters into Tunis: :\\"Here was I, anti- war, but like the rest of us feeling the exhilaration of the barbarian.\\" Critical review The first volume was given strong reviews by The Sunday Times and the Times Literary Supplement. The Morning Star review adds: \\"The second volume of Milligan's war biography left me with a determination to repair the omission of not having read the first volume ... and an equal determination to look out for the third volume when it appears.\\" References Category:1974 British novels Category:Works by Spike Milligan Category:British autobiographical novels Category:British comedy novels Category:British satirical novels Category:World War II memoirs Category:Michael Joseph books ","title":"&quot;Rommel?&quot; &quot;Gunner Who?&quot;"},{"id":"18756773","text":"Aligned Assets' are a UK-based company from Surrey that develops address management, gazetteer software and Augmented Reality solutions for local authorities, the emergency services and the commercial sector.

Background The road named after Snake Shyam by the Mysore City Corporation Shyam was born to M.R.Subbarao and A.Nagalakshmi Mirle in Cheluvaamba Hospital, Krishnarajanagara, Mysore State, now in Karnataka, India.The unknown animal lover Snake Shyam ourkarnataka.com. Retrieved 2008-08-06. He demonstrated his interest in snakes at an early age, when a snake invaded a neighbor's home. After convincing those around not to kill the snake, he caught it and released it into the garden. From this incident, he earned his nickname. Avocation By profession, Shyam was a driver, transporting children to school, but beginning in 1982 he began to be frequently called upon to retrieve snakes that had encroached on people's properties, a job for which he receives no pay. Called multiple times each day, Shyam uses a pillowcase and a badminton racquet without strings to net the snakes, which he then releases into the forest. Though his avocation to safely remove these snakes has cost him considerable expense, Shyam continues from the desire to see these snakes released rather than killed. Recently, authorities in Mysore have offered to defray some of Shyam's expenses by paying his telephone bills. In 2004, he estimated that he may have caught and released over 40,000 snakes since he began in 1980; as of February 2008, the official record, which he began in 1980(Unofficially he has caught nearly 40,000 Snakes between 1980-1997), was 11,755. Though Shyam has only been bitten four times in his rescue work, he has developed an allergy to antivenin, which requires that he exercise great care in handling snakes. His knowledge of snakes‚Äîhe can identify 28-30 local species of snakes‚Äîis founded on personal experience, but supplemented by reading the works of or speaking to professionals such as Romulus Whitaker, J.C. Daniel and faculty at Mysore University. Shyam's van features paintings depicting snakes and also displays his slogans: \\"Snakes are not as poisonous as human beings\\" and \\"Care for the rare\\". Snake Shyam was elected to Mysore City Corporation in the elections held in March 2013, sponsored by the BJP. In August 2018, he was expelled from the party for \\"anti-party activities\\" and chose to contest as an independent, unsuccessfully. In 2019, he completed another record by catching 32,000 Snakes.

As co-founder and chairperson (since 2007) of HTC Corporation and integrated chipset maker VIA Technologies. She is considered one of the most powerful and successful women in computer technology. Wang's father was Wang Yung-ching, founder of the plastics and petrochemicals conglomerate Formosa Plastics Group and one of the wealthiest individuals in Taiwan before his death in 2008. As of 2014, she is listed as the 54th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes. Early life and education Wang was born on 15 September 1958 in Taipei, Taiwan. She studied abroad at The College Preparatory School in Oakland, California, and went on to receive her bachelor's degree in economics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1981. Career Wang joined First International Computer (FIC) in 1982. Wang and others founded VIA in 1987 and HTC in 1997. In May 2011, Forbes ranked her with husband Wen Chi Chen as the wealthiest person in Taiwan, with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. In August 2012, Wang was named No. 56 on Forbes' list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women. As of 2014, she is listed as the 54th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes. In Oct. 2014, Cher Wang refused to accept the Final Award of the \\"HKIAC / A11022 arbitration\\" and appealed to the Hong Kong High Court (Case No.:HCCT40 / 2014) before Judge Mimmie Chan. Wang asserted that the Award was contrary to public policy. VIA product VT3421, an anti-hack chip (also named asTF376) was suspected in assisting the Chinese government of surveilling mobile devices of anti-communist and human rights activists. In a hearing before the Justice Mimmie Chan, in the High Court of Hong Kong, the defense counsel maintained that the Award was in violation of Hong Kong's public order and morals. In June 2015 the Judge remised the case back to Arbitrator Anthony Neoh. The tribunal upheld the conviction in October 2015, and VIA lost the case for millions of dollars. The backdoor of hacking prevention chip VT3421/TF376 causes big issues in Taiwan. 11 Legislative Senators made the suggestion to suspend the government procurement of hTC related communication products until the VIA Electronics' VT3421/TF376 hacking control chip backdoor issue should be thoroughly investigated by National Security Bureau and National Communication Committee. In March 2015, Cher Wang took over the CEO role from Peter Chou and returned to the day-to-day operations of HTC. In September 2017, HTC and Google announced a US$1.1 billion cooperation agreement, which involved certain HTC employees would join Google, and Google would receive HTC IP through a non-exclusive licensing agreement. Wang's Charity Foundations are holding eight investment companies' stocks with a market value of over US$200 million. However, only US$ twenty- seven thousand has been donated to charity(0.000135%). Wang suited the reporter with anger and failed the case on Feb. 2018. Philanthropy In 2011 Wang donated US$28.1 million to help found Guizhou Forerunner College, a charitable college in southwest China set up by VIA Technologies' non-profit Faith-Hope-Love Foundation. The not-for-profit college aims to provide three years of free or low-cost education to students from low-income families. Wang has stated that if the college proves successful she may well set up additional similar institutions in other parts of the country. Wang has also made significant donations to the University of California, Berkeley, including funding to support and enhance the prestigious American Physical Society's Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize, given to researchers who make considerable contributions to the field of condensed-matter physics. Wang and Chen also provide funding to support a collaborative program between the psychology departments at UC Berkeley and Tsinghua University in Beijing. The Berkeley-Tsinghua Program for the Advanced Study in Psychology aims to create and support collaborative, psychological research between faculty and students from both universities. In August 2012 Wang donated 6,000 HTC Flyer tablet PCs to 60 high schools in Taipei.  Personal life  Wang is an avid philanthropist who says she prefers to stay out of the limelight despite her many accomplishments. She has begun to insert herself in Taiwan politics, however, by supporting Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou in his bid for re- election\\"Ma Ying-jeou wins Taiwan election,\\" Financial Times, 14 January 2012 and by voicing her support for the 1992 Consensus.\\"I back 1992 Consensus as a true Taiwanese, says HTC's Cher Wang,\\" Want China Times, 14 January 2012 Her husband is Wen Chi Chen, the CEO of VIA Technologies. Wang is Christian. She has two children.  Controversies  Wang had been accused of backing and funding anti-LGBTQ groups and activities in Taiwan, including the cooperation with the US-based groups organizing International House of Prayer. Estimate $388 million was allegedly donated through two non-profit organizations run by her to anti-LGBTQ groups in Taiwan over the past five years. Due to the ruling of Taiwan's Council of Grand Justices that the Civil Code's prohibition of same-sex marriage is unconstitutional and must be amended by 24 May 2019, on 4 May 2019, Wang & her \\"Faith, Hope & Love Foundation\\" along with Democratic Progressive Party legislator Lin Tai-hua drafted a \\"same-sex union\\" bill which contains a \\"fake marriage\\" clause that would authorize prosecutors or social welfare agencies to request that a court intervene and abrogate a same-sex union if relatives within three degrees of consanguinity of either member of the union believe that it was not for the purpose of two people \\"living life together\\". The version also has a clause that says, \\"as one‚Äôs conscience and freedom should not be affected by the enactment of this act, conveying or inculcating beliefs against the relationship described in Article 2 (same-sex union) does not constitute discrimination\\". The bill was called by Taiwan legislator and LGBT rights activist Yu Mei-nu \\"stark discrimination against same-sex couples,\\" questioning what right people have to scrutinize the sincerity of others' marriage.

Her World War II career was cut short due to the war coming to an end, but, post-war, she was reactivated and served the Navy until she was put into reserve and eventually transferred to Venezuela as Puerto Miranda.  Construction and career  The second ship to be so named by the Navy, Waxsaw (AN-91) -- originally classified as YN-120‚Äîwas laid down on 31 May 1944, at Duluth, Minnesota, by the Zenith Dredge Co.; launched on 15 September 1944; sponsored by Mrs. J. L. Conlon, wife of the general manager of the Zenith Dredge Co. shipyard; and commissioned on 6 May 1945, Lt. Kearny R. Garrison, USNR, in command.  World War II related service  The new netlaying ship sailed for Boston, Massachusetts, on 11 May, and arrived there on 29 May, after steaming via Cleveland, Ohio; Ogdensburg, New York; the St. Lawrence Seaway; Cornwall, Ontario; Montreal and Quebec, Quebec; and Halifax, Nova Scotia. Following shakedown out of Melville, Rhode Island, from 13 to 30 June, the netlayer put into Boston for post-shakedown availability. Waxsaw headed for the Panama Canal on 10 July, expecting her ultimate destination to be Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands. However, upon her arrival at the Small Craft Training Center, San Pedro, California, she was ordered to the Naval Net Depot and Training School, Tiburon Bay, California, for 18 days of refresher training. Arriving there on 10 August, the ship remained in the San Francisco, California, region on temporary duty in connection with the removal of the net line protecting San Francisco after the Japanese surrender in mid-August. Completing that duty on 24 September, Waxsaw underwent an availability at Alameda, California, before she was assigned to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet.  Post-war service  On 12 October 1945, the netlayer headed for the U.S. East Coast in company with sister ship . Attached to Service Force, Atlantic Fleet, on 3 November, Waxsaw operated at Green Cove Springs, Florida, establishing moorings at the St. Johns River area for the Reserve Fleet units until late in 1949, when she was shifted to her new home port of Norfolk, Virginia. From mid-July 1946 to mid January 1947, the ship operated as part of US Atlantic Mine Fleet, with Norfolk, Virginia as home port. The ship ferried large mooring buoys from Norfolk to Charleston, South Carolina in July and August. Waxsaw served at Argentia Naval Base, Newfoundland replacing mooring buoys with larger units from beginning of September thru mid-December 1946 when severe winter weather forced termination of activity from whence ship returned to home port. Based there at the time of the outbreak of the Korean War in the summer of 1950, Waxsaw not only took part in extensive netlaying operations in Hampton Roads, Virginia, but also towed targets and participated in various training exercises in ensuing months. For the next nine years, Waxsaw operated with the Atlantic Fleet off the eastern seaboard of the United States, ranging from Nova Scotia to Key West, Florida. Her home ports during this time included Norfolk, Virginia; Key West, Florida; and Charleston, South Carolina. During those years, Waxsaw performed a variety of service functions; participated in mine-hunting exercises; laid nets and buoys during U.S. Atlantic Fleet amphibious exercises including amphibious maneuvers off Onslow Beach, North Carolina; cleared objects from the channel entrance at Hampton Roads; and even briefly operated at Charleston as a salvage vessel equipped with compressors, a recompression chamber, and other deep-sea diving gear. She also took part in NATO exercises off Nova Scotia and served at the Mine Defense Laboratory at Panama City, Florida.  Final inactivation  Decommissioned on 23 March 1960, Waxsaw was ultimately transferred under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program to Venezuela in October 1963. Renamed Puerto Miranda (H-30), the netlayer served with the Venezuelan Navy as a survey ship into the late 1970s. Struck from the Navy List in December 1977, the ship was deleted from the Venezuelan Navy List apparently soon thereafter.

In order to formulate a comprehensive theory of the nature of early attachments, Bowlby explored a range of fields including evolution by natural selection, object relations theory (psychoanalysis), control systems theory, evolutionary biology and the fields of ethology and cognitive psychology. There were some preliminary papers from 1958 onwards but the full theory is published in the trilogy Attachment and Loss, 1969- 82\\\\. Although in the early days Bowlby was criticised by academic psychologists and ostracised by the psychoanalytic community, attachment theory has become the dominant approach to understanding early social development and given rise to a great surge of empirical research into the formation of children's close relationships. Brief description of theory In infants, behavior associated with attachment is primarily a process of proximity seeking to an identified attachment figure in situations of perceived distress or alarm, for the purpose of survival. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some months during the period from about six months to two years of age. During the later part of this period, children begin to use attachment figures (familiar people) as a secure base to explore from and return to. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment which in turn lead to 'internal working models' which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships. Separation anxiety or grief following serious loss are normal and natural responses in an attached infant. The human infant is considered by attachment theorists to have a need for a secure relationship with adult caregivers, without which normal social and emotional development will not occur. However, different relationship experiences can lead to different developmental outcomes. Mary Ainsworth developed a theory of a number of attachment patterns or \\"styles\\" in infants in which distinct characteristics were identified; these were secure attachment, avoidant attachment, anxious attachment and, later, disorganized attachment. In addition to care-seeking by children, peer relationships of all ages, romantic and sexual attraction, and responses to the care needs of infants or sick or elderly adults may be construed as including some components of attachment behavior. Earlier theories A theory of attachment is a framework of ideas that attempt to explain attachment, the almost universal human tendency to prefer certain familiar companions over other people, especially when ill, injured, or distressed.Mercer p. 37 Historically, certain social preferences, like those of parents for their children, were explained by reference to instinct, or the moral worth of the individual. Father and child The concept of infants' emotional attachment to caregivers has been known anecdotally for hundreds of years. Most early observers focused on the anxiety displayed by infants and toddlers when threatened with separation from a familiar caregiver. Psychological theories about attachment were suggested from the late nineteenth century onward. Freudian theory attempted a systematic consideration of infant attachment and attributed the infant's attempts to stay near the familiar person to motivation learned through feeding experiences and gratification of libidinal drives. In the 1930s, the British developmentalist Ian Suttie put forward the suggestion that the child's need for affection was a primary one, not based on hunger or other physical gratifications. A third theory prevalent at the time of Bowlby's development of attachment theory was \\"dependency\\". This approach posited that infants were dependent on adult caregivers but that dependency was, or should be outgrown as the individual matured. Such an approach perceived attachment behaviour in older children as regressive whereas within attachment theory older children and adults remain attached and indeed a secure attachment is associated with independent exploratory behaviour rather than dependence.Prior and Glaser p. 20 William Blatz, a Canadian psychologist and teacher of Bowlby's colleague Mary Ainsworth, was among the first to stress the need for security as a normal part of personality at all ages, as well as normality of the use of others as a secure base and the importance of social relationships for other aspects of development. Current attachment theory focuses on social experiences in early childhood as the source of attachment in childhood and in later life.Mercer p. 23 Attachment theory was developed by Bowlby as a consequence of his dissatisfaction with existing theories of early relationships. Early developments Bowlby was influenced by the beginnings of the object relations school of psychoanalysis and in particular, Melanie Klein, although he profoundly disagreed with the psychoanalytic belief then prevalent that saw infants' responses as relating to their internal fantasy life rather than to real life events. As Bowlby began to formulate his concept of attachment, he was influenced by case studies by Levy, Powdermaker, Lowrey, Bender and Goldfarb. An example is the one by David Levy that associated an adopted child's lack of social emotion to her early emotional deprivation. Bowlby himself was interested in the role played in delinquency by poor early relationships, and explored this in a study of young thieves. Bowlby's contemporary Ren√© Spitz proposed that \\"psychotoxic\\" results were brought about by inappropriate experiences of early care. A strong influence was the work of James and Joyce Robertson who filmed the effects of separation on children in hospital. They and Bowlby collaborated in making the 1952 documentary film A Two-Year Old Goes to the Hospital illustrating the impact of loss and suffering experienced by young children separated from their primary caretakers. This film was instrumental in a campaign to alter hospital restrictions on visiting by parents. In his 1951 monograph for the World Health Organization, Maternal Care and Mental Health, Bowlby put forward the hypothesis that \\"the infant and young child should experience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with his mother (or permanent mother substitute) in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment\\" and that not to do so may have significant and irreversible mental health consequences. This proposition was both influential in terms of the effect on the institutional care of children, and highly controversial. There was limited empirical data at the time and no comprehensive theory to account for such a conclusion.Bowlby (1988) p. 24 Attachment theory Love Wire and cloth mother surrogates in Harry Harlow's The Nature of Love Following the publication of Maternal Care and Mental Health, Bowlby sought new understanding from such fields as evolutionary biology, ethology, developmental psychology, cognitive science and control systems theory and drew upon them to formulate the innovative proposition that the mechanisms underlying an infants tie emerged as a result of evolutionary pressure. He realised that he had to develop a new theory of motivation and behaviour control, built on up-to-date science rather than the outdated psychic energy model espoused by Freud. Bowlby expressed himself as having made good the \\"deficiencies of the data and the lack of theory to link alleged cause and effect\\" in \\"Maternal Care and Mental Health\\" in his later work \\"Attachment and Loss\\" published between 1969 and 1980. Bowlby's first official representations were carried out for the relationship theory in three very controversial lectures in 1957 by the British Psychoanalytical Society in London.Bretherton, Inge: Developmental Psychology (1992), 28, S. 759-775 The formal origin of attachment theory can be traced to the publication of two 1958 papers, one being Bowlby's The Nature of the Child's Tie to his Mother, in which the precursory concepts of \\"attachment\\" were introduced, and Harry Harlow's The Nature of Love, based on the results of experiments which showed, approximately, that infant rhesus monkeys spent more time with soft mother- like dummies that offered no food than they did with dummies that provided a food source but were less pleasant to the touch. Bowlby followed this up with two more papers, Separation Anxiety (1960a), and Grief and Mourning in Infancy and Early Childhood (1960b). At about the same time, Bowlby's former colleague, Mary Ainsworth was completing extensive observational studies on the nature of infant attachments in Uganda with Bowlby's ethological theories in mind. Mary Ainsworth's innovative methodology and comprehensive observational studies informed much of the theory, expanded its concepts and enabled some of its tenets to be empirically tested. Attachment theory was finally presented in 1969 in Attachment the first volume of the Attachment and Loss trilogy. The second and third volumes, Separation: Anxiety and Anger and Loss: Sadness and Depression followed in 1972 and 1980 respectively. Attachment was revised in 1982 to incorporate more recent research. =Ethology= Bowlby's attention was first drawn to ethology when he read Lorenz's 1952 publication in draft form although Lorenz had published much earlier work. Soon after this he encountered the work of Tinbergen, and began to collaborate with Robert Hinde.Holmes p. 62 In 1953 he stated \\"the time is ripe for a unification of psychoanalytic concepts with those of ethology, and to pursue the rich vein of research which this union suggests\\". Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen Konrad Lorenz had examined the phenomenon of \\"imprinting\\" and felt that it might have some parallels to human attachment. Imprinting, a behavior characteristic of some birds and a very few mammals, involves rapid learning of recognition by a young bird or animal exposed to a conspecific or an object or organism that behaves suitably. The learning is possible only within a limited age period, known as a critical period. This rapid learning and development of familiarity with an animate or inanimate object is accompanied by a tendency to stay close to the object and to follow when it moves; the young creature is said to have been imprinted on the object when this occurs. As the imprinted bird or animal reaches reproductive maturity, its courtship behavior is directed toward objects that resemble the imprinting object. Bowlby's attachment concepts later included the ideas that attachment involves learning from experience during a limited age period, and that the learning that occurs during that time influences adult behavior. However, he did not apply the imprinting concept in its entirety to human attachment, nor assume that human development was as simple as that of birds. He did, however, consider that attachment behavior was best explained as instinctive in nature, an approach that does not rule out the effect of experience, but that stresses the readiness the young child brings to social interactions.Bowlby (1969) 2nd ed. pp. 220‚Äì223 Some of Lorenz's work had been done years before Bowlby formulated his ideas, and indeed some ideas characteristic of ethology were already discussed among psychoanalysts some time before the presentation of attachment theory. =Psychoanalysis= Bowlby's view of attachment was also influenced by psychoanalytical concepts and the earlier work of psychoanalysts. In particular he was influenced by observations of young children separated from familiar caregivers, as provided during World War II by Anna Freud and her colleague Dorothy Burlingham. Evacuee children in 1937 Observations of separated children's grief by Ren√© Spitz were another important factor in the development of attachment theory. However, Bowlby rejected psychoanalytical explanations for early infant bonds. He rejected both Freudian \\"drive-theory\\", which he called the Cupboard Love theory of relationships, and early object-relations theory as both in his view failed to see the attachment as a psychological bond in its own right rather than an instinct derived from feeding or sexuality.Holmes pp. 62‚Äì3 Thinking in terms of primary attachment and neo-darwinism, Bowlby identified as what he saw as fundamental flaws in psychoanalysis, namely the overemphasis of internal dangers at the expense of external threat, and the picture of the development of personality via linear \\"phases\\" with \\"regression\\" to fixed points accounting for psychological illness. Instead he posited that several lines of development were possible, the outcome of which depended on the interaction between the organism and the environment. In attachment this would mean that although a developing child has a propensity to form attachments, the nature of those attachments depends on the environment to which the child is exposed.Holmes pp. 64‚Äì5 =Internal working model= The important concept of the internal working model of social relationships was adopted by Bowlby from the work of the philosopher Kenneth Craik, who had noted the adaptiveness of the ability of thought to predict events, and stressed the survival value of and natural selection for this ability. According to Craik, prediction occurs when a \\"small-scale model\\" consisting of brain events is used to represent not only the external environment, but the individual's own possible actions. This model allows a person to mentally try out alternatives and to use knowledge of the past in responding to the present and future. At about the same time that Bowlby was applying Craik's ideas to the study of attachment, other psychologists were using these concepts in discussion of adult perception and cognition. =Cybernetics= The theory of control systems (cybernetics), developing during the 1930s and '40s, influenced Bowlby's thinking. The young child's need for proximity to the attachment figure was seen as balancing homeostatically with the need for exploration. The actual distance maintained would be greater or less as the balance of needs changed; for example, the approach of a stranger, or an injury, would cause the child to seek proximity when a moment before he had been exploring at a distance. Behavioural development and attachment Behaviour analysts have constructed models of attachment. Such models are based on the importance of contingent relationships. Behaviour analytic models have received support from research. and meta-analytic reviews. Developments Although research on attachment behaviors continued after Bowlby's death in 1990, there was a period of time when attachment theory was considered to have run its course. Some authors argued that attachment should not be seen as a trait (lasting characteristic of the individual), but instead should be regarded as an organizing principle with varying behaviors resulting from contextual factors. Related later research looked at cross-cultural differences in attachment, and concluded that there should be re-evaluation of the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans. In a recent study conducted in Sapporo, Behrens, et al., 2007 found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main & Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification. Interest in attachment theory continued, and the theory was later extended to adult romantic relationships by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver. Peter Fonagy and Mary Target have attempted to bring attachment theory and psychoanalysis into a closer relationship by way of such aspects of cognitive science as mentalization, the ability to estimate what the beliefs or intentions of another person may be. A \\"natural experiment\\" has permitted extensive study of attachment issues, as researchers have followed the thousands of Romanian orphans who were adopted into Western families after the end of Nicolae Ceau≈üescu's regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by Michael Rutter, has followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption and new relationships, and the physical and medical problems associated with their early lives. Studies on the Romanian adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, have in fact yielded reason for optimism. Many of the children have developed quite well, and the researchers have noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development. Neuroscientific studies are examining the physiological underpinnings of observable attachment style, such as vagal tone which influences capacities for intimacy, stress response which influences threat reactivity (Lupien, McEwan, Gunnar & Heim, 2009), as well as neuroendocrinology such as oxytocin,. These types of studies underscore the fact that attachment is an embodied capacity not only a cognitive one. Effects of changing times and approaches Some authors have noted the connection of attachment theory with Western family and child care patterns characteristic of Bowlby's time. The implication of this connection is that attachment-related experiences (and perhaps attachment itself) may alter as young children's experience of care change historically. For example, changes in attitudes toward female sexuality have greatly increased the numbers of children living with their never-married mothers and being cared for outside the home while the mothers work.right This social change, in addition to increasing abortion rates, has also made it more difficult for childless people to adopt infants in their own countries, and has increased the number of older-child adoptions and adoptions from third-world sources. Adoptions and births to same-sex couples have increased in number and even gained some legal protection, compared to their status in Bowlby's time.Mercer pp. 152‚Äì56 One focus of attachment research has been on the difficulties of children whose attachment history was poor, including those with extensive non-parental child care experiences. Concern with the effects of child care was intense during the so-called \\"day care wars\\" of the late 20th century, during which the deleterious effects of day care were stressed. As a beneficial result of this controversy, training of child care professionals has come to stress attachment issues and the need for relationship-building through techniques such as assignment of a child to a specific care provider. Although only high- quality child care settings are likely to follow through on these considerations, nevertheless a larger number of infants in child care receive attachment-friendly care than was the case in the past, and emotional development of children in nonparental care may be different today than it was in the 1980s or in Bowlby's time.Mercer pp. 160‚Äì63 Finally, any critique of attachment theory needs to consider how the theory has connected with changes in other psychological theories. Research on attachment issues has begun to include concepts related to behaviour genetics and to the study of temperament (constitutional factors in personality), but it is unusual for popular presentations of attachment theory to include these. Importantly, some researchers and theorists have begun to connect attachment with the study of mentalization or Theory of Mind, the capacity that allows human beings to guess with some accuracy what thoughts, emotions, and intentions lie behind behaviours as subtle as facial expression or eye movement. The connection of theory of mind with the internal working model of social relationships may open a new area of study and lead to alterations in attachment theory.Mercer pp. 165‚Äì68 Reception=1950s to the 1970s The maternal deprivation hypothesis, attachment theory's precursor, was enormously controversial. Ten years after the publication of the hypothesis, Ainsworth listed nine concerns that she felt were the chief points of controversy. Ainsworth separated the three dimensions of maternal deprivation into lack of maternal care, distortion of maternal care and discontinuity of maternal care. She analysed the dozens of studies undertaken in the field and concluded that the basic assertions of the maternal deprivation hypothesis were sound although the controversy continued.Karen pp. 123‚Äì24 As the formulation of attachment theory progressed, critics commented on empirical support for the theory and for the possible alternative explanations for results of empirical research.Karen pp. 115‚Äì18 Wootton questioned the suggestion that early attachment history (as it would now be called) had a lifelong impact. In 1957 found the young relationship theory in the DDR (East Germany) by an essay of James Robertson in the Zeitschrift f√ºr √§rztliche Fortbildung (magazine for a medical further education) and Eva Schmidt-Kolmer carried out some journal extracts from Bowlby's essay Maternal Care and mental Health for WHO.Robertson, J.: √úber den Verlust m√ºtterlicher F√ºrsorge in fr√ºher Kindheit. In: Zeitschrift f√ºr √§rztliche Fortbildung 1957, 21/22 In the following period it came to extensive comparative development psychological in the DDR at the end of the fifties. Examinations between family-bound babies and small children, day and week hayracks-as well as Institution children. The findings could do with regard to the morbidity for the family-bound children, the physical and emotional development as well as adaption disturbances at change of environment. After the construction of the Berlin Wall 1961 it didn't come to any additional publications in the DDR Relationship theory and comparative investigations with family-bound children. The previous ones Research results weren't published further and got like the relationship theory into oblivion in the DDR in the subsequent years.Pl√ºckhahn, Jens: Dauerheime f√ºr S√§uglinge und Kleinkinder in der DDR aus dem Blickwinkel der Bindungstheorie.

Children may achieve a given function, such as a sense of security, in many different ways and the various but functionally comparable behaviours should be categorized as related to each other. This way of thinking saw the secure base concept (the organisation of exploration of an unfamiliar situation around returns to a familiar person) as \\"central to the logic and coherence of attachment theory and to its status as an organizational construct.\\" Similarly, Thompson pointed out that \\"other features of early parent-child relationships that develop concurrently with attachment security, including negotiating conflict and establishing cooperation, also must be considered in understanding the legacy of early attachments.\\" Specific disciplinesPsychoanalysis= From an early point in the development of attachment theory, there was criticism of the theory's lack of congruence with the various branches of psychoanalysis. Like other members of the British object-relations group, Bowlby rejected Melanie Klein's views that considered the infant to have certain mental capacities at birth and to continue to develop emotionally on the basis of fantasy rather than of real experiences. But Bowlby also withdrew from the object-relations approach (exemplified, for example, by Anna Freud), as he abandoned the \\"drive theory\\" assumptions in favor of a set of automatic, instinctual behaviour systems that included attachment. Bowlby's decisions left him open to criticism from well-established thinkers working on problems similar to those he addressed. Bowlby was effectively ostracized from the psychoanalytic community. More recently some psychoanalysts have sought to reconcile the two theories in the form of attachment-based psychotherapy, a therapeutic approach. =Ethology= Ethologists expressed concern about the adequacy of some of the research on which attachment theory was based, particularly the generalisation to humans from animal studies. Schur, discussing Bowlby's use of ethological concepts (pre-1960) commented that these concepts as used in attachment theory had not kept up with changes in ethology itself. Ready to explore Ethologists and others writing in the 1960s and 1970s questioned the types of behaviour used as indications of attachment, and offered alternative approaches. For example, crying on separation from a familiar person was suggested as an index of attachment. Observational studies of young children in natural settings also provided behaviours that might be considered to indicate attachment; for example, staying within a predictable distance of the mother without effort on her part and picking up small objects and bringing them to the mother, but usually not other adults. Although ethological work tended to be in agreement with Bowlby, work like that just described led to the conclusion that \\"[w]e appear to disagree with Bowlby and Ainsworth on some of the details of the child's interactions with its mother and other people\\". Some ethologists pressed for further observational data, arguing that psychologists \\"are still writing as if there is a real entity which is 'attachment', existing over and above the observable measures.\\" Robert Hinde expressed concern with the use of the word \\"attachment\\" to imply that it was an intervening variable or a hypothesised internal mechanism rather than a data term. He suggested that confusion about the meaning of attachment theory terms \\"could lead to the 'instinct fallacy' of postulating a mechanism isomorphous with the behaviours, and then using that as an explanation for the behaviour\\". However, Hinde considered \\"attachment behaviour system\\" to be an appropriate term of theory language which did not offer the same problems \\"because it refers to postulated control systems that determine the relations between different kinds of behaviour.\\" =Cognitive development= Bowlby's reliance on Piaget's theory of cognitive development gave rise to questions about object permanence (the ability to remember an object that is temporarily absent) and its connection to early attachment behaviours, and about the fact that the infant's ability to discriminate strangers and react to the mother's absence seems to occur some months earlier than Piaget suggested would be cognitively possible. More recently, it has been noted that the understanding of mental representation has advanced so much since Bowlby's day that present views can be far more specific than those of Bowlby's time. =Behaviourism= In 1969, Gewirtz discussed how mother and child could provide each other with positive reinforcement experiences through their mutual attention and therefore learn to stay close together; this explanation would make it unnecessary to posit innate human characteristics fostering attachment. Learning theory saw attachment as a remnant of dependency and the quality of attachment as merely a response to the caregivers cues. Behaviourists saw behaviours such as crying as a random activity that meant nothing until reinforced by a caregivers response therefore frequent responses would result in more crying. To attachment theorists, crying is an inborn attachment behaviour to which the caregiver must respond if the infant is to develop emotional security. Conscientious responses produce security which enhances autonomy and results in less crying. Ainsworth's research in Baltimore supported the attachment theorists view.Karen pp. 166‚Äì73 In the last decade, behaviour analysts have constructed models of attachment based on the importance of contingent relationships. These behaviour analytic models have received some support from research and meta-analytic reviews. Methodology There has been critical discussion of conclusions drawn from clinical and observational work, and whether or not they actually support tenets of attachment theory. For example, Skuse based criticism of a basic tenet of attachment theory on the work of Anna Freud with children from Theresienstadt, who apparently developed relatively normally in spite of serious deprivation during their early years. This discussion concluded from Freud's case and from some other studies of extreme deprivation that there is an excellent prognosis for children with this background, unless there are biological or genetic risk factors. The psychoanalyst Margaret Mahler interpreted ambivalent or aggressive behaviour of toddlers toward their mothers as a normal part of development, not as evidence of poor attachment history. Parents and child Some of Bowlby's interpretations of the data reported by James Robertson were eventually rejected by the researcher, who reported data from 13 young children who were cared for in ideal circumstances during separation from their mothers. Robertson noted, \\"...Bowlby acknowledges that he draws mainly upon James Robertson's institutional data. But in developing his grief and mourning theory, Bowlby, without adducing non- institutional data, has generalized Robertson's concept of protest, despair and denial beyond the context from which it was derived. He asserts that these are the usual responses of young children to separation from the mother regardless of circumstance...\\"; however, of the 13 separated children who received good care, none showed protest and despair, but \\"coped with separation from the mother when cared for in conditions from which the adverse factors which complicate institutional studies were absent\\". In the second volume of the trilogy, Separation, published two years later, Bowlby acknowledged that Robertsons foster study had caused him to modify his views on the traumatic consequences of separation in which insufficient weight was given to the influence of skilled care from a familiar substitute.Karen pp. 82‚Äì86 Some authors have questioned the idea of attachment patterns, thought to be measured by techniques like the Strange Situation Protocol. Such techniques yield a taxonomy of categories considered to represent qualitative difference in attachment relationships (for example, secure attachment versus avoidant). However, a categorical model is not necessarily the best representation of individual difference in attachment. An examination of data from 1139 15-month-olds showed that variation was continuous rather than falling into natural groupings. This criticism introduces important questions for attachment typologies and the mechanisms behind apparent types, but in fact has relatively little relevance for attachment theory itself, which \\"neither requires nor predicts discrete patterns of attachment.\\" As was noted above, ethologists have suggested other behavioural measures that may be of greater importance than Strange Situation behaviour.Children 1980s on Following the argument made in the 1970s that attachment should not be seen as a trait (lasting characteristic of the individual), but instead should be regarded as an organising principle with varying behaviours resulting from contextual factors, later research looked at cross-cultural differences in attachment, and concluded that there should be re-evaluation of the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans. Various studies appeared to show cultural differences but a 2007 study conducted in Sapporo in Japan found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main & Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification. Recent critics such as J. R. Harris, Steven Pinker and Jerome Kagan are generally concerned with the concept of infant determinism (Nature versus nurture) and stress the possible effects of later experience on personality. Building on the earlier work on temperament of Stella Chess, Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory etiology was based, arguing that heredity was far more important than the transient effects of early environment, for example a child with an inherent difficult temperament would not illicit sensitive behavioural responses from their care giver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies.Karen pp. 248‚Äì64 Subsequent research has not bourne out Kagan's argument and broadly demonstrates that it is the caregivers' behaviours that form the child's attachment style although how this style is expressed may differ with temperament. Harris and Pinker have put forward the notion that the influence of parents has been much exaggerated and that socialisation takes place primarily in peer groups, although H. Rudolph Schaffer concludes that parents and peers fulfill different functions and have distinctive roles in children's development. Concern about attachment theory has been raised with regard to the fact that infants often have multiple relationships, within the family as well as in child care settings, and that the dyadic model characteristic of attachment theory cannot address the complexity of real-life social experiences.

A parody of the \\"Vision\\" genre of religious text, it has been described as the \\"best major work of parody\\" in the Irish language. Text The tale exists in two manuscript versions, one (sometimes referred to as B) in the fifteenth century collection Leabhar Breac (\\"Speckled Book\\"), and the other (known as H) in a manuscript dating from the sixteenth or seventeenth century. The two versions have significant differences. Synopsis The Vision is the story of Ani√©r MacConglinne, a scholar from Armagh, and his efforts to rid King Cathal mac Finnguine of a \\"demon of gluttony\\" that lived in Cathal's throat. One day, MacConglinne decides to abandon scholarship and become a poet, because \\"[t]o spend his life studying was wretched.\\" He decides to visit Cathal, then travelling around Munster, since he is hungry and has heard that Cathal is well supplied with \\"whitemeats\\", i.e. dairy products. MacConglinne packs up and travels across the country in a single night, arriving in Cork in the evening. He stays in a dilapidated guesthouse attached to a monastery, where his singing of psalms disturbs the people of Cork. The monks bring him meagre rations, and MacConglinne composes a satire on them, whereupon he is seized, stripped naked and whipped. The abbot, Manch√≠n, proposes crucifying the unrepentant poet; MacConglinne complains that they have shown him no hospitality whatever and curses them as \\"curs, robbers and shit-hounds\\". The monks decide to defer crucifying him until the following day, but that night MacConglinne is visited by an angel of God, and is granted a vision of a land made entirely of food: > The fort we reached was beautiful, > With works of custards thick, > Beyond the loch. > New butter was the bridge in front, > The rubble dyke was wheaten white, > Bacon the palisade. > > Stately, pleasantly it sat, > A compact house and strong. > Then I went in: > The door of it was dry meat, > The threshold was bare bread, > cheese-curds the sides. > > Smooth pillars of old cheese, > And sappy bacon props > Alternate ranged; > Fine beams of mellow cream, > White rafters - real curds, > Kept up the house. The next day he tells the monks about it and Manch√≠n says that the vision is the only thing that will cure King Cathal of his gluttony. If MacConglinne will communicate the vision to King Cathal, the monks will not kill him for making satires about them. MacConglinne somewhat sulkily agrees, and duly travels to meet Cathal and his entourage. Cathal is still the helpless victim of his gluttony, and MacConglinne is only able to get the king's attention by grinding his teeth so loudly that \\"there was no one in the neighbourhood [...] that did not hear the noise\\". He manages to get Cathal to give him an apple, the first time in three and a half years that the king has offered food to anyone else. MacConglinne provokes Cathal into giving him more and more apples, ultimately persuading the king to fast with him. After MacConglinne has got the king to fast for two consecutive nights, he prepares a vast meal of roasted meats and has Cathal lashed to the walls of his palace. Then he taunts the demon of gluttony by passing bits of roast meat before Cathal's mouth and eating them himself. Cathal roars for MacConglinne to be killed, but none of his men obey. MacConglinne relates to Cathal his vision of the land made of food, going into more and more detail about his adventures there, until \\"the lawless beast that abode in the inner bowels of Cathal MacFinguine came forth, until it was licking his lips outside his head.\\" MacConglinne traps the demon under a cauldron and has the king's men evacuate the palace of all people and property, then he has the palace set on fire. The demon escapes to the roof of the house and MacConglinne demands that it \\"do obeisance\\", i.e. bow down to them. The demon replies defiantly: > I have been three half-years in Cathal's mouth, to the ruin of Munster and > the Southern Half besides, and if I were to continue three half years more, > I should ruin all Ireland. MacConglinne threatens the demon with the Gospels, and it flies \\"into the air among the people of hell.\\" Cathal rewards MacConglinne for curing him, and the tale concludes with a list of rewards owed to anyone who is able to recite it in its entirety.

More information=Fenris Wolf The Fenris Wolf is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, based on the wolf Fenrir from Norse mythology. ;Publication history The Fenris Wolf first appeared in Marvel Comics in Journey into Mystery #114 (March 1965), and was adapted from Norse legends by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The character subsequently appeared in Thor #276-278 (Oct.‚ÄìDec. 1978) and Thor (vol. 2) #80-83 (Aug.‚ÄìOct. 2004) and 85 (Dec. 2004). The Fenris Wolf received an entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #4. ;Fictional character biography The Fenris Wolf is a creature of Asgardian origin, said to be the offspring of Loki and the giantess Angrboda. However, many years ago, he was part of the basis of the story Little Red Riding Hood. The goddess Iduna walks the forests of Asgard carrying a bundle of golden apples. These \\"Golden Apples of Immortality\\" are for All-Father Odin, and Iduna takes them to him every year. Along her journey, she meets Haakun the Hunter. Haakun greets her warmly and tells her to go in peace. As Iduna continues further down the path, the Fenris Wolf sees her and transforms himself. Iduna next comes upon \\"a frail stranger\\". The stranger offers Iduna protection along her journey, but she declines the offer. The stranger takes a strong interest in Iduna's basket and begins asking her questions. She quickly grows suspicious, saying his hands seem so grasping and brutal, and his voice sounds like that of a beast. She finds his manner sinister and frightening, and says his eyes burn with hatred and pure savagery. She then discovers that the stranger is actually the Fenris Wolf in disguise. The Fenris Wolf shapeshifts into his true form and attacks her. Haakun the Hunter arrives and drives the Fenris Wolf away with his enchanted battle axe, causing the Fenris Wolf to shrink in an attempt to escape. The axe pursues the Fenris Wolf and finally strikes him, spiriting him off to the shadowy land of Varinheim. Just like Norse mythology, Odin had the Dwarfs forge the chain Gleipnir (\\"deceiver\\" or \\"entangler\\"). It appeared to be only a silken ribbon, but was made of six wondrous ingredients: the sound of a cat's footfall, the beard of a woman, the roots of a mountain, bear's sinews, fish's breath, and bird's spittle (which explains why these things are not found today). When it came to binding the Fenris Wolf, Tyr lost his hand in the process, as the Fenris Wolf would only allow the chain to be put on him if one of the gods put their hand in his mouth. It is prophesied that when Ragnarok occurs, the Fenris Wolf will devour Odin. Hela at one time unchained the Fenris Wolf to bring about Ragnarok, only to be thwarted by Thor.Thor #276 (Oct. 1978) A giant offspring of the Fenris Wolf, named Hoarfen, once battled the Hulk and his Pantheon allies. The battle goes poorly for Hoarfen, causing him many injuries.Incredible Hulk #409-410 ;True Ragnarok Loki later unchained the Fenris Wolf to aid him, Ulik, and Hyrm in attacking Asgard, using weapons that were forged for them by Surtur. Ulik and the Fenris Wolf attacked Thor together, only for Thor to attack them using Mjolnir, which resulted in the blast removing Sif's arm. Hyrm joined up with Ulik and the Fenris Wolf and managed to shatter Mjolnir.Thor (vol. 2) #80 The Fenris Wolf then attacked Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man when they were in Asgard. When the Fenris Wolf was about to attack Thor, Captain America kicked the Fenris Wolf in the stomach to reclaim his shield, then Thor defeated him, causing him to flee.Thor (vol. 2) #81 When Kurse was protecting innocent children, the Fenris Wolf fought Kurse and killed him by sending a hammer into his skull. The Fenris Wolf assisted in the attack on Vanaheim and faced Thor again in battle. Thor bound the Fenris Wolf in chains and used his body to knock down Durok in order to save Sif. With Durok slain, the Fenris Wolf snapped his chains and fought Thor, only to be struck down by Beta Ray Bill. Beta Ray Bill used the power of his hammer Stormbreaker upon the Fenris Wolf, reducing him to a skeleton as the monster's punishment for attacking a weakened Thor. Those that were fighting with the Fenris Wolf fled. The Fenris Wolf returned to life and swallowed Asgard's sun and moon assisting to bring about Ragnarok, as Asgard perishes.Thor (vol. 2) #82-85 (Dec. 2004-March 2005) The Fenris Wolf is the ancestor of the Asgardian Hrimhari.Thor Annual #12 Asgard reforms and re- establishes itself over the state of Oklahoma. The Fenris Wolf escapes from his prison, a place deep in the dimensional 'Hells' and steals a technological device that would slaughter innocents, humans and gods alike. The Warriors Three, with the aid of a superpowered A.I.M. scientist, defeat him in honorable battle. He is now kept prisoner in an Asgardian courtyard, where he may be better supervised.Warriors Three #1-4 (2010-2011) ;Film The Fenris Wolf in Thor: Ragnarok. * The Fenris Wolf appears in Thor: Tales of Asgard, voiced by Brian Drummond.The Fenris Wolf is seen as a patron at a bar. * The Fenris Wolf appears in Thor: Ragnarok.

During the film's climax, the Fenris Wolf battles the Hulk and gets tossed off the side of Asgard into the void below. ;Television * The Fenris Wolf appears in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, with vocal effects provided by Fred Tatasciore. In the episode \\"Meet Captain America\\", It is seen among the Asgardian creatures that the Red Skull and Baron Strucker captured upon finding an entrance to Asgard. * The Fenris Wolf appears in Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors.

Part of the south wing contains Norman timber carved by the monks of Quarr Abbey in 1139 and Haseley claims to be the oldest house on the Island. Past owners have included four kings, Harold, William I, William II and Henry VIII, it was also the home of the judge, Sir Thomas Fleming, who tried Guy Fawkes. In 1537 Thomas Wriothesley obtained a grant of it from the Crown, and sold it next year to John Mill of Southampton, whose son George made it his residence in the reign of Elizabeth. Here, Sir John Oglander notes, he 'kept a brave house and lived worshipfully.' From him the manor passed in the same way as Binstead to the Fleming family of North Stoneham Park, and as of 1912 belonged to Mr. John E. A. Willis-Fleming. According to Sir John Oglander the house, pleasantly situated in the low ground to the north of Horringford station, was practically rebuilt by the Mills. In 1781 the then owner, Col. Edward Fleming, remodelled the two south rooms and generally modernized the house. By 1976 Haseley was derelict and overgrown with ivy.

Thomson was a self-taught botanist and fruit farmer based in San Diego's North County, while Riley was an engineer with Lockheed from Santa Clara, California. Both Thomson and Riley shared an enthusiasm for rare fruits and plants which had not been previously widely cultivated in California. Riley and Thomson soon began collaborating to publish a newsletter on tropical and subtropical fruits using a mimeograph machine. In 1968 they expanded operations to found the CRFG. Membership was swelled by a rapid influx of newcomers to California who were \\"without prejudice to what could not be grown\\" in the state.  Mission statement  To encourage and foster public and scientific interest, research, education in and the preservation of rare fruit plants that have edible seeds, fruits, leaves, stems or roots and are not commonly grown commercially. The furtherance and encouragement of these activities shall be for the benefit of the public rather than commercial interests.  What is rare fruit?  A fruit is considered to be rare because it is: * Not normally grown in a particular area or climatic zone. * Scarce or about to be extinct. * Of unusual properties, such as the miracle fruit which changes the sense of taste. * A new species that have recently been introduced or discovered. * A species that has not been grown commercially.

He taught hula dancing for over sixty years in Hawaii, Japan, Guam, Australia, Germany, England, North America, and South America.Honolulu Weekly Article August 29, 2007 Naope was a scholar of ancient hula, which is hula developed and danced before 1893. He first studied hula at the age of three years under his great-grandmother, Mary Malia Pukaokalani Naope, who lived to be over 100 years old. At the age of four he began to study with Mary Kanaele, the mother and teacher of Edith Kanaka'ole. When he moved to Oahu at the age of ten, he studied for ten years with Joseph Ilalaole. After graduating from high school, Naope moved to Honolulu where he opened the George Naope Hula School, then later continued his studies under Kumu Hula Lokalia Montgomery and Tom Hiona.Profile at the Kane Hula Festival Naope began to teach hula at the age of thirteen. His family was poor, so he taught hula for fifty cents per week in order to continue to pay for school. He taught chant and kahiko to the Ray Kinney dancers, and traveled with Ray Kinney.Excerpt from the March 1996 Hula Mae'ole Seminar Brochure In 1964, Naope founded the Merrie Monarch Festival, an annual week-long festival of traditional Hawaiian arts, crafts, and performances featuring a three-day hula competition. The festival became both a popular success and an important part of the Hawaiian Renaissance. In an interview Naope said of founding the festival, \\"I felt the hula was becoming too modern and that we have to preserve it. David Kalakaua [King of Hawaii, 1874‚Äì91; aka \\"The Merrie Monarch\\"] brought the hula back to Hawaii and made us realize how important it was for our people. There was nothing here in Hilo, so I decided to honor Kalakaua and have a festival with just hula. I didn't realize that it was going to turn out to be one of the biggest things in our state.\\" Naope was honored with numerous other awards, including being named a Living Treasure of Hawai'i by the Buddhist temple Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawai'i, \\"Treasure of Hawaii\\" by President George W. Bush and the Smithsonian Institution, and receiving a National Heritage Fellowship by the National Endowment for the Arts in 2006, which is the United States' highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. In 2007, Naope founded the Halau Hula Is Hawai'i Trust and Hula Is Hawai'i, LLC, and instructed his entire estate to be placed into his trust. Despite his Last Will and Testament, certain individuals went against his wishes. Naope founded the Humu Moolelo, a quarterly journal of the hula arts.

Mesina was murdered in mid-1935 after she attempted to fend off a would-be rapist and suffered 74 strikes with a stone before she died. Her beatification cause commenced under Pope John Paul I on 22 September 1978 - titled as a Servant of God - while Pope John Paul II confirmed that she had died \\"in defensum castitatis\\" and beatified her on 4 October 1987. Life Antonia Mesina was born on 21 June 1919 as the second of ten children born to the poor policeman Agostino Mesina and Grazia Rubanu. She was baptized in the local parish church of Saint Peter. She received her Confirmation on 10 November 1920 and received her First Communion in 1926 from the local bishop. Once she completed her initial education - which spanned a brief period of time - she took over housekeeping at home in order to assist her bedridden mother who suffered from a heart condition. She took care of the household including the care of her siblings as well as cooking and cleaning and washing. Mesina joined Catholic Action movement in 1929 and became a noted recruiter. Mesina liked to be part of this movement and believed that it \\"helps one to be good\\". Mesina set off for Mass one morning with a friend and after that went to gather firewood in mid-1935 when the teenager Ignazio Catigu (1916-1935) attacked her and tried to rape her. Her friend screamed and ran off to find help. Mesina managed to escape twice, but on the third attempt was knocked down. Mesina defended herself and was murdered because she resisted his advances and was struck with a rock 74 times. Her remains were examined after her death and it was found that she had not been violated during or after the violent attack. The last blow to her smashed the skull and disfigured her face. Catigu was soon apprehended and on 27 April 1937 sentenced to death; the firing squad executed him on the following 5 August. On 5 October 1935 the Catholic Action member Venerable Armida Barelli - who had met Mesina once - met with Pope Pius XI and informed him of Mesina's activism and her murder. Beatification The beatification process opened on 22 September 1978 under Pope John Paul I and Mesina was henceforth titled as a Servant of God after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" to the cause. The cause commenced in the Diocese of Nuoro on 17 April 1979 after Bishop Giovanni Melis Fois inaugurated the cognitional process and later closed it on 11 March 1985 before the cause received the validation from the C.C.S. on 7 March 1986. The postulation overseeing the cause compiled and sent the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. in 1986 for assessment which allowed for theologians to review and approve it on 13 January 1987 with the C.C.S. doing the same on 7 March 1987. Pope John Paul II approved the fact that Mesina had died \\"in defensum castitatis\\" on 8 May 1987 and therefore of approved her beatification.

Critics cite the government- sponsored migration of large numbers of Han Chinese into the Tibet Autonomous Region as a major component of sinicization. According to the government of Tibet in exile, Chinese policy has allegedly resulted in the disappearance of elements of Tibetan culture; this has been called \\"cultural genocide\\".Burbu, Dawa (2001) China's Tibet Policy, Routledge, , pp 100‚Äì124Samdup, Tseten (1993) Chinese population ‚Äì Threat to Tibetan identity The government in exile says that the policies intend to make Tibet an integral part of China and control desire for Tibetan self-determination. The Chinese government maintains that its policies have benefited Tibet, and cultural and social changes are consequences of modernization. According to the government, Tibet's economy has expanded; improved services and infrastructure have improved the quality of life of Tibetans, and the Tibetan language and culture have been protected.  History =Early developments After the fall of the Qing dynasty and before 1950, the region which roughly corresponds to the modern-day Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) was a de facto independent nation. It printed its own currency and postage, and maintained international relations. Tibet claimed three provinces (Amdo, Kham and √ú-Tsang), but only controlled western Kham and √ú-Tsang. Since 1950, China made eastern Kham part of Sichuan and western Kham part of the new Tibet Autonomous Region.Burbu, Dawa (2001) China's Tibet Policy, Routledge, , pp 86‚Äì99 During the early-20th-century Republic of China era which followed the Qing dynasty, Chinese Muslim general and Qinghai governor Ma Bufang is accused by Tibetans of implementing sinicization and Islamification policies in Tibetan areas. Forced conversion and heavy taxes were reported under his rule. After Mao Zedong won the Chinese civil war in 1949, his goal was the unification of the \\"five nationalities\\" as the People's Republic of China under the Communist Party of China. The Tibetan government in Lhasa sent Ngabo (known as Ngabo in English sources) to Chamdo in Kham, a strategic town near the border, with orders to hold his position while reinforcements came from Lhasa to fight the Chinese. On 16 October 1950, news arrived that the People's Liberation Army was advancing towards Chamdo and had taken the town of Riwoche (which could block the route to Lhasa). Ngabo and his men retreated to a monastery, where the People's Liberation Army surrounded and captured them. Ngabo wrote to Lhasa suggesting a peaceful surrender instead of war. According to the Chinese negotiator, \\"It is up to you to choose whether Tibet would be liberated peacefully or by force. It is only a matter of sending a telegram to the PLA group to recommence their march to Lhasa.\\" Ngabo accepted Mao's Seventeen-Point Agreement, which stipulated that in return for Tibet becoming part of the People's Republic of China, it would be granted autonomy. Lacking support from the rest of the world, in August 1951 the Dalai Lama sent a telegram to Mao accepting the agreement. The delegates signed the agreement under duress, and the Tibetan's government's future was sealed. Mao Zedong receives Tibetan Buddhist prayer scarf from Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet in 1954 Although the incorporation of Tibet into China is known in Chinese historiography as the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, the Dalai Lama considers it a colonization and the Tibetan Youth Congress agrees that it was also an invasion. The Chinese government points to improvements in health and the economy as justifications for their assertion of power in what it calls a historically-Chinese region. According to the Dalai Lama, China has encouraged Han Chinese immigration into the region. Before the agreement, Tibet's economy was dominated by subsistence agriculture and the stationing of 35,000 Chinese troops during the 1950s strained the region's food supplies. When the Dalai Lama visited Mao Zedong in Beijing in 1954, Mao told him that he would move 40,000 Chinese farmers to Tibet. Forster-Latsch, H. and Renz S., P.

Red Guards attacked civilians, who were accused of being traitors to communism. More than six thousand monasteries were looted and destroyed. Monks and nuns were forced to leave their monasteries to \\"live a normal life\\", with those who resisted imprisoned. Prisoners were forced to perform hard labor, tortured and executed. Although the Potala Palace was threatened, Premier Zhou Enlai intervened and restrained the Tibetan Red Guards. Recent developments A sign (in Tibetan and Chinese) indicating surveillance cameras near the Monument the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, Lhasa, Tibet, 2018 China's National Strategic Project to Develop the West, introduced during the 1980s after the Cultural Revolution, encourages the migration of Chinese people from other regions of China into Tibet with bonuses and favorable living conditions. People volunteer to be sent there as teachers, doctors and administrators to assist Tibet's development. Citing an unqualified labour force and less- developed infrastructure, the Chinese government has encouraged migrants to stimulate competition and change Tibet from a traditional to a market economy with economic reforms set forth by Deng Xiaoping. Tibetans are the majority ethnic group in the Tibet Autonomous Region, making up about 93 percent of the population in 2008.Pinteric, Uros (2003): http://www.sidip.org/SIDIP_files/pintericu_tibet.pdf International Status of Tibet, Association for Innovative Political Science, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. The 2008 attacks by Tibetans on Han- and Hui-owned property were reportedly due to the large Han Hui influx into Tibet. According to George Fitzherbert, \\"To engage with China's arguments concerning Tibet is to be subjected to the kind of intellectual entrapment, familiar in the Palestinian conflict, whereby the dispute is corralled into questions which the plaintiff had never sought to dispute. Tibetans complain of being robbed of their dignity in their homeland by having their genuinely loved leader incessantly denounced, and of being swamped by Chinese immigration to the point of becoming a minority in their own country. But China insistently condemns such complaints as separatism, an offence in China under the crime of 'undermining national unity', and pulls the debate back to one about Tibet's historical status. Foreigners raise questions about human rights and the environment, but China again denounces this as a foreign intervention in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation, and pulls the debate back to Tibet's historical status.\\" The Chinese government has attempted to develop Tibet as part of its China Western Development policy and has invested 310 billion yuan (about 45.6 billion U.S. dollars) in Tibet since 2001. In 2009 it invested over $7 billion into the region, 31 percent more than the previous year. The Qinghai-Tibet Railway was completed in 2006 at a cost of $3.68 billion, leading to increased tourism from the rest of China.Xinhua News Agency (24 August 2005). New height of world's railway born in Tibet. Retrieved 25 August 2005. The Shanghai government contributed $8.6 million to the construction of the Tibet Shanghai Experimental School, where 1,500 Tibetan students receive a primarily-Chinese education. Some young Tibetans feel that they are Tibetan and Chinese, and are fluent in Tibetan and Mandarin Chinese. In August 2020, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping gave a speech in which he stated that it is \\"necessary to actively guide Tibetan Buddhism to adapt to the socialist society and promote the Sinicization of Tibetan Buddhism.\\"  Religion  The Chinese government claims it will control how the 15th Dalai Lama will be chosen, contrary to centuries of tradition. Chinese government officials repeatedly warn \\"that he must reincarnate, and on their terms.\\" When the Dalai Lama confirmed a Tibetan boy in 1995 as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, the second-ranking leader of the Gelugpa sect, the Chinese government took away the boy and his parents and installed its own child lama. The Dalai Lama's choice, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima's whereabouts are still unknown. The Chinese government claimed he has \\"a stable job and a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life. In 2020 US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that \\"Tibetan Buddhists, like members of all faith communities, must be able to select, educate and venerate their religious leaders according to their traditions and without government interference,\\" \\"We call on the PRC government to immediately make public the Panchen Lama's whereabouts and to uphold its own constitution and international commitments to promote religious freedom for all persons.\\" The head of the Kagyu sect, the Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje, was also groomed by Chinese leaders, but at age 14 he fled to India in 1999. Within Tibet, schools issue warnings to parents that students should not be attending classes at monasteries, a long-standing tradition, or engage in any religious activity. Punishments for doing so are severe, including loss of government welfare and subsidies. The practice of removing prayer flags, symbols of Tibetan culture and religious belief, has increased since 2010 as the persecution of religion escalates. In June 2020 Chinese authorities started a ‚Äúbehavioral reform,‚Äù program, begun in the Tibet Autonomous Region's Qinghai's Golog (in Chinese, Guoluo) and Tengchen (Dingqing) county in Chamdo, ordering the destruction of prayer flags. The 2019 Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy annual report found that Chinese police forces and surveillance teams moved into monasteries and villages to monitor Tibetan residents for signs of opposition to China's rule, ‚Äúfacial-recognition software and careful monitoring of digital spaces [were] deployed to suppress political protests against the increased clampdowns on civil and political rights.‚Äù According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, during the summer of 2019, the Chinese authorities demolished thousands of residences at the Yachen Gar Tibetan Buddhist center in Sichuan Province, displacing as many as 6,000 monks and nuns. In April 2019, China authorities closed the Larung Gar Buddhist Academy to new enrollment. Authorities also intensified a crackdown on possessing or displaying photos of the Dalai Lama, continued to monitor religious festivals, and, in some areas, banned students from attending festivals during their school holidays. In protest of repressive government policies, at least 156 Tibetans have self-immolated since February 2009.  Education, employment and language  The Chinese Constitution guarantees autonomy in ethnic regions and says local governments should use the languages in common use. Since 1949 the Chinese government has used the minority- education system for Tibetans to acquire the Chinese language, considered a key tool of Sinicization pressure, contrary to UNESCO policy on cultural and linguistic diversity. Beginning in the early 2000s, there had been a process of Tibetanization of Tibetan education in Qinghai's Tibetan regions. Through grassroots initiatives by Tibetan educators, Tibetan had been somewhat available as the main language of instruction in primary, secondary and tertiary education in Qinghai. Tibetan language in Qinghai remains even more marginalized in education and government employment, with a small number of public-service positions mandating a Tibetan degree or Tibetan language skills. In 1987, the Tibet Autonomous Region published more explicit regulations calling for Tibetan to be the main language in schools, government offices and shops. Those regulations were eliminated in 2002 and state language policies and practices ‚Äújeopardize the continuing viability‚Äù of Tibetan civilization. In Tibetan areas, official affairs are conducted primarily in Chinese. It is common to see banners promoting the use of Chinese. Monasteries and schools often held classes on the written language for ordinary people, and monks gave lessons while traveling, but officials ordered monasteries and schools to end the classes. The Chinese Communist Party issued orders in December 2018 forbidding informal classes taught by Tibetan monks or other unapproved groups, and ordered schools to stop teaching all subjects in Tibetan, except the Tibetan language in first grade classes, in May 2019 in Golog, in Chinese, Guoluo, Tibet Autonomous Region. Tibetan entrepreneur and education advocate Tashi Wangchuk was detained for two years and then indicted in 2017 by court officials after speaking to The New York Times for a documentary video and two articles on Tibetan education and culture. Tibetan neidi or boarding schools, in operation since 1985, have been increasing enrollment rapidly. Tibetan children are removed from their families, and Tibetan religious and cultural influences, and placed in Tibetan only boarding schools across China, well outside the Tibet Autonomous Region. Older students are allowed to leave the campus only if accompanied by a teacher. Chinese government policy requires only Tibetan government job candidates to disavow any allegiance to the Dalai Lama and support government ethnic policies, as announced in October 2019 on the TAR government's online education platform, ‚ÄúSupport the (Communist) Party‚Äôs leadership, resolutely implement the [Chinese Communist] Party‚Äôs line, line of approach, policies, and the guiding ideology of Tibet work in the new era; align ideologically, politically, and in action with the Party Central Committee; oppose any splittist (division of Tibet from P.R.C.) tendencies; expose and criticize the Dalai Lama; safeguard the unity of the motherland and ethnic unity and take a firm stand on political issues, taking a clear and distinct stand.‚Äù In April 2020, classroom instruction was switched from Tibetan to Mandarin Chinese in Ngaba, Sichuan.  Nomadic herders resettlement  The Chinese government launched an initiative that demanded the nomads to relocate to urban housing in newly constructed villages in 2003. At the end of 2015, in \\"what amounts to one of the most ambitious attempts made at social engineering, the Chinese government is in the final stages of a 15-year-old campaign to settle the millions of pastoralists who once roamed China‚Äôs vast borderlands,\\" the Chinese government claimed it will have moved the remaining 1.2 million nomad herders into towns that provide access to schools, electricity and modern health care. This policy, based on the government view that grazing harms grasslands, has been questioned by ecologists in China and abroad claiming the scientific foundations of nomad resettlement are questionable. Anthropological studies of government-built relocation centers have documented chronic unemployment, alcoholism and the fraying of millenniums-old traditions. Human rights advocates say the many protests by herders are met with harsh crackdowns by security forces. In a 2011 report, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, criticized China's nomad resettlement policies as overly coercive and said they led to \\"increased poverty, environmental degradation and social breakdown\\". In 2017 Tibetan nomads previously forced from traditional grazing lands in a state-directed resettlement scheme in Qinghai were told to go back due to a new policy announced in 2016, so authorities could use their current homes for development as tourist centers and government employees housing. \\"After two years of living in the new towns, residents are now being forced to move back to their original grasslands without their animals, which are the main source of livelihood in Tibetan nomadic communities\\".  Population growth  Market in Lhasa, 1993 In 1949, there were between 300 and 400 Han-Chinese residents in Lhasa.Roland Barraux, Histoire des Dala√Ø Lamas ‚Äì Quatorze reflets sur le Lac des Visions, Albin Michel, 1993, reprinted in 2002, Albin Michel, . In 1950, the city covered less than three square kilometres and had around 30,000 inhabitants; the Potala Palace and the village of Zh√∂l below it were considered separate from the city.Liu Jiangqiang, Preserving Lhasa's history (part one), in Chinadialogue, 13 October 2006.Emily T. Yeh, Living Together in Lhasa. Ethnic Relations, Coercive Amity, and Subaltern Cosmopolitanism : \\"Lhasa‚Äôs 1950s population is also frequently estimated at around thirty thousand. At that time the city was a densely packed warren of alleyways branching off from the Barkor path, only three square kilometers in area. The Potala Palace and the village of Zh√∂l below it were considered separate from the city.\\" In 1953, according to the first population census, Lhasa had about 30,000 residents (including 4,000 beggars, but not including 15,000 monks).Thomas H. Hahn, Urban Planning in Lhasa. The traditional urban fabric, contemporary practices and future visions , Presentation Given at the College of Architecture, Fanzhu University, 21 October 2008. In 1992 Lhasa's permanent population was estimated at a little under 140,000, including 96,431 Tibetans, 40,387 Han-Chinese, and 2,998 Chinese Muslims and others. Added to that figure were 60,000‚Äì80,000 temporary residents, primarily Tibetan pilgrims and traders.  Debate on the intention of the PRC  In 1989, high-profile French criminal lawyer Robert Badinter participated in an episode of Apostrophes (a well-known French television program devoted to human rights) with the Dalai Lama. Referring to the disappearance of Tibetan culture, Badinter used the phrase \\"cultural genocide\\".Les droits de l'homme Apostrophes, A2 ‚Äì 21 April 1989 ‚Äì 01h25m56s, Web site of the INA: http://www.ina.fr/archivespourtous/index.php?vue=notice&from;=fulltext&full;=Salonique#_notice=5&total;_notices=8 In 1993, the Dalai Lama used the same phrase to describe the destruction of Tibetan culture. 10 March Archive During the 2008 Tibetan unrest, he accused the Chinese of cultural genocide in their crackdown. In 2008 Robert Barnett, director of the Program for Tibetan Studies at Columbia University, said that it was time for accusations of cultural genocide to be dropped: \\"I think we have to get over any suggestion that the Chinese are ill-intentioned or trying to wipe out Tibet.\\"Robert Barnett, Seven Questions: What Tibetans Want , Foreign Policy, March 2008. Barnett voiced his doubts in a review in the New York Review of Books: \\"Why, if Tibetan culture within Tibet is being 'fast erased from existence', [do] so many Tibetans within Tibet still appear to have a more vigorous cultural life, with over a hundred literary magazines in Tibetan, than their exile counterparts?\\"Robert Barnett, Thunder from Tibet, a review of Pico Iyer's book, The Open Road: The Global Journey of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, Knopf, 275 p. , in The New York Review of Books, vol. 55, number 9. 29 May 2008.

After seven seasons of rugby league, the club switched codes to Association football in 1903, becoming Bradford City Association Football Club. History The Manningham team that won the 1896 championship, posing with the shield awarded In 1880, Manningham FC was formed after the Manningham Albion Club was disbanded.Early Days at Bradford City FC Museum (archived, 30 Oct 2013) The club originally played at a field in Whetley Hill, known as Carlisle Road. Manningham FC played rugby football under the Rugby Football Union but later became a founding member of the breakaway Northern Rugby Football Union (later renamed the Rugby Football League) in 1895. In the new competition's first season, Manningham finished on top of the ladder, becoming history's first rugby league champions. In 1886, the club moved to Valley Parade, a ground that was hacked out of a hillside over a few months. After the 1890-91 season, Manningham along with other Yorkshire Senior clubs Batley, Bradford, Brighouse, Dewsbury, Halifax, Huddersfield, Hull, Hunslet, Leeds, Liversedge and Wakefield decided that they wanted their own county league starting in 1891 along the lines of a similar competition that had been played in Lancashire. The clubs wanted full control of the league but the Yorkshire Rugby Football Union would not sanction the competition as it meant giving up control of rugby football to the senior clubs. In the 1896-7 season the Northern Union's championship was split into two separate county competitions with Manningham competing in the Yorkshire division. The club performed strongly again and almost won the Yorkshire Senior Competition but in the end fell short on the table by just one win. However, the club fell upon hard times after being relegated, and in 1903 only the successful staging of an archery tournament kept the club going. On 30 January 1903, Scotsman James Whyte, a sub-editor of the Bradford Observer met Football Association representative John Brunt at Valley Parade, the home of Manningham Football Club, to discuss establishing a Football League club within the city. A series of meetings was held, and on 29 May 1903, at the 23rd annual meeting of Manningham FC, the committee decided to leave the rugby league code and switch to association football, becoming Bradford City A.F.C..

The community takes in the neighbouring village of Ton Pentre. Toponymy Pentre village in Welsh, from pentref (pen head and tref town). Early and industrial history St Peter's Church Pre-1850, the area which is now Pentre was made up of several scattered farms tended by tenant farmers for absentee landlords. With the discovery, in the early 19th century, of economically viable coal deposits in Dinas Rhondda it was not long until expeditions reached the mid valleys. In 1857 Edward Curteis of Llandaff leased the mineral rights of Tyr-y-Pentre from Griffith Llewellyn of Baglan and soon had two levels opened, the Pentre and Church. During the early part of 1864 deeper shafts had been sunk by the Pentre Coal Company. The mines in the Pentre were some of the most profitable of all the collieries in the Rhondda. By the early 20th century, Pentre was a busy town and the main shopping area for the upper Rhondda and was also the centre for local government, with the local council offices built in Llewellyn Street in 1882.

Born in Grafton, Vermont, to former slaves, she became famous late in life for her oral recordings of her family's history, which can be traced back to Africa and England. Biography Daisy Turner's enslaved father, Alexander Turner, escaped from his plantation at the start of the Civil War, and joined the 1st New Jersey Cavalry of the Union Army. In the spring of 1863, Turner guided his regiment to his old plantation in Port Royal, Virginia, where he killed his former overseer. After military service, he returned to New England where he worked as a logger. He and his wife Sally had a homestead in Grafton, Vermont, where they raised 16 children. Daisy Turner was proud of her heritage, and was a strong, outspoken woman from childhood to her death at the age of 104. She is remembered as a gifted storyteller and family historian. The Turner family homestead, where they raised 13 children, is located on the \\"Daisy Turner Loop\\", a biking trail near Grafton Pond. Turner was a \\"striking beauty in her youth, with high cheekbones and deep-set eyes\\" and led an exciting life, many of the details of which have been recorded carefully. Daisy can be seen reciting Civil War poetry, at the remarkable age of 104, in Ken Burns' PBS documentary, The Civil War.. The Civil War: A Film by Ken Burns. 1990-09-26. No. 5, season 1. One of Turner's favorite personal stories, which she recounted often, involved a school pageant when Turner was about eight years old. In the pageant, Turner's teacher had instructed Turner to recite a poem with a black doll, but at the last minute, Turner resisted and spontaneously made up her own poem. This story became the subject of a children's book by Michael Medearis and Angela Shelf Medearis, and receives scholarly attention in Racial Innocence: Performing American Childhood from Slavery to Civil Rights, by Robin Bernstein.Robin Bernstein (2011) Innocence: Performing American Childhood from Slavery to Civil Rights, (New York: New York University Press, 2011), 194-196, 221-222, 226-228. Daisy Turner's story continues to attract wide attention as part of an effort to preserve the folk history of Vermont and the United States.

Early life and career Xu Lijia was born nearly deaf in one ear and nearly blind in one eye. She started swimming at age four and attended a sports school in the Changning District of Shanghai. When she was ten Xu was chosen by coach Zhang Jing to train for sailing. Just a year after she started sailing, Xu Lijia won the 1998 Chinese National Championships held in Hong Kong. In 1999, when she was twelve, Xu Lijia narrowly escaped death in a sudden storm while training on the open sea off the coast of Fujian Province with her coach and teammates. Wind speeds reached , resulting in high waves, capsizing their boats. They were stranded at sea for more than two hours before managing to return to the base. Optimist and Europe classes Xu Lijia began her international career aged 11 in the Optimist class in the 1998 Asian Championships, winning her first international gold medal in the 1999 Asian Championships. She then won the gold medals in the 2001 and 2002 World Championships, and the 2002 Asian Games, all in the Optimist class. After she reached 15, in 2003 Xu progressed to the Europe class (then an Olympic class) according to International Sailing Federation (ISAF) rules. She switched to coach Liu Xiaoma, the husband of her old coach Zhang Jing. Tumor During a routine physical examination before the 2004 Summer Olympics, doctors found a giant-cell tumor of bone near Xu Lijia's left knee. She initially hoped to postpone the tumor-removal surgery until after the Olympics, but doctors warned that the tumor could spread within months which would necessitate amputation of the leg. Xu underwent the surgery and missed the Athens Olympics. Laser Radial class In 2005 Xu began racing Laser Radial class dinghies after the ISAF decided to replace the Europe class with Laser Radial in the women's sailing competition of the Olympics. The next year she won gold medals at the 2006 World Championships in Los Angeles and the 2006 Asian Games in Doha. In March 2008 Xu Lijia won a silver medal at the World Championships in Auckland, New Zealand. In August she won her first Olympic medal, a bronze at the Qingdao regatta of the 2008 Summer Olympics, behind American sailor Anna Tunnicliffe and Gintare Volungeviciute of Lithuania. After winning a gold medal at the 2009 National Games of China, Xu took a long break from the sport in order to recover from her back injuries and to commence her studies at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majoring in Business Management. She resumed training in May 2011 and won a silver medal in May 2012 at the World Championships held in Boltenhagen, Germany. 2012 Summer Olympics On 6 August 2012, Xu Lijia won the gold medal in the women's Laser Radial race at the 2012 Summer Olympics, beating Marit Bouwmeester of the Netherlands and Evi Van Acker of Belgium. It was China's second ever Olympic gold in sailing. Partly because of her inspiring story of overcoming multiple adversities to become an Olympic champion, Xu was chosen over many better known athletes to be China's flag bearer at the closing ceremony of the London Olympics.

Chellberg Farm is significant as it represents the ethnic heritage of a nearly forgotten Swedish-American settlement. The farm includes a family home, water house with windmill, chicken coop/bunkhouse, and the original barn. Other nearby Swedish landmarks have been restored or preserved, including the Burstrom Chapel and the Burstrom Cemetery.United States Department of the Interior, National Park Service; NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES, MULTIPLE PROPERTY DOCUMENTATION FORM; Selected Swedish Farmsteads of Porter County, Indiana; July 10, 1994 Swedish Community The early Swedish Lutheran Church and later the Skola, SchoolSwedish immigrants located in Baillytown, in Porter County, Indiana for several reasons, one being that there were new jobs available, another because like most immigrants, they sought out others like themselves. Baillytown's proximity to Chicago connected it to the larger paths of Swedish immigration from the 1840s to the 1920s. The railroad came to the region in the 1850s and it provided for settlement and the transport of lumber from the lakeshore. A local story has it that an earlier Swedish immigrant, Jonas Asp, aided Joel Wicker in recruiting Swedes, including the Kjellberg family to work his lands.William J. Ahrendt, \\"Reminiscences of the Baillytown Area: A Lecture to the Duneland Historical Society\\", in Duneland Notes (April 1980) Norris Combs ed., Duneland Historical Society, Chesterton, Indiana These settlers then encouraged friends and families to join them.A. Goodspeed and Charles Blanchard, History of Porter and Lake Counties, Indiana (Chicago: F. A. Battey and Co., Publishers, 1882; reproduction, Evansville, Indiana: Unigraphic Inc., 1979), P. 290-312 The immigrants provided the necessary labor force for developing farmland, railroads, and industry in the area. The close-knit Swedish-American community emphasized their cultural heritage, teaching their children Swedish, establishing Swedish churches, and participating in social events where Swedish traditions were observed. Architecture=The Farmhouse thumbBuilt in 1885, the house is considered folk Victorian. This was a common style across the United States at the end of the 19th Century. The original structures was built on the 'T-shaped plan'. A two-story gable abutted a one-story wing. This created a location for a porch addition in the L between the gabled section and the wing. There may have been a second porch on the west side before the '1901' kitchen addition was added.Chellberg Farm, Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore; Historic American Buildings Survey; HABS IN-296; WDC; 1998 Unlike many houses of this time, ornamentation was restrained. The house included a parlor, plenty of bedrooms and the kitchen. Overtime, a craftsman fireplace was added in the dining room and later a glass-enclosed front porch. The glass enclosure was removed during rehabilitation. Like many structures in this area, local labor and local materials were put to good use. The clay soils were turned into a thriving brick industry. the red brick facade is made of porter brick. The Barn thumbBuilt over 130 years ago, the barn remains intact. Like its neighbors, the Chellberg barn is located north of the main house. It was built between 1870 and 1879, using a design common for that time. The 1880 census showed the Chellbergs having 'two milk cows, six other cattle, two sheep and five horses.' Over the years, the use of the barn changed and so did its design. By the 1900s, the family was operating a dairy farm. It is believed that the windows were installed during this period to improve light and ventilation. In 1917, a silo was added to provide for silage. The barn is a three-bay structure with a gabled roof. It is by , standing tall. The construction is on four bents built using two by uprights. Two bents form the east and west ends, with the remaining two bents forming the center bay. The wood consists of a mix of oak, elm, ash, maple and basswood. Originally built on stone piers, Carl Chellberg added a concrete floor in 1938. The barn is located in an east- west alignment to provide maximum sun on the structure. It is also adjacent to the wood ravine, which helps block the winter winds. Corncrib Corncrib and the Chicken CoopThe current corncrib was built in 1941, designed and built by Carl Chellberg. Over the years, the Chellbergs had several different types of corncribs. Originally, the farm had a drive-through corncrib, which gave way to the silo during the dairy farm period. The current crib is a single storage structure located just north of the house. The orientation is north and south apparently to conform to the property limited space. The existing structure is built on concrete piles to repel rodents. Large squared timber beams are placed atop these posts and then floored using tongue and groove flooring, which was taken from the silo. In the silo, the flooring ran up and down the structure. For this structure, the boards were split in half and cut to the necessary length and laid horizontally. At a later date, a wire mesh was placed on the inside of the walls for better protection from pests. The south wall of the shed was shared with a tractor shed, which is now gone. The tractor shed housed the Chellbergs' 1939 Allis-Chalmers tractor. Once the tractor arrived, it was used instead of the horses for the harvest.

They emigrated to the U.S. in 1863 with their son, Carl (born 1859). Family tradition says that they immediately moved to the Bailly area. They did not set up a home on the current location. They first lived on Mineral Springs road, south of the tracks from the Swedish Lutheran Church.Hardesty's 1876 Atlas of Westchester Township The 1871 Great Chicago Fire destroyed much of the Swedish community in Chicago. Many Swedish residents choose to move to the Swedish community of Indiana. A popular story that is the Kjellberg family met Joel Wicker (the son-in-law of Joseph Bailly) while in Chicago and that Joel hired Anders to clean out brush in preparation for planting. Joel is said to have provided a small log house for the family. Anders Kjellherg had been a tailor and a lay preacher the Lutheran Church in Sweden. He continued to place an emphasis on his religion after immigrating and helped to establish the Swedish Lutheran Church, now the Augsburg Lutheran Church. The Kjellbergs' second child, Carolyn, was born in the mid-1860s. She died at the age of three or four. The family also had a foster son, Simon Larson, who was born in 1874 and joined the family before 1880.Chellberg Landscape Report, Chellberg Farm, Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, National Park Service, March 2000, pgs. 12, 17, 23, 24, 29, 32, 37, 49-50 Arrival in Northwest Indiana In October 1869 the family took legal title to the Chellberg Farm property. On November 1, 1869 the Kjellberg (Chellberg) family took possession of what is known as the Chellberg Farm. John Oherg and Anders Kjellberg represented the family in the purchase of from J. H. Wicker. It cost $12.00 per acre. They also paid off an older contract of Wicker's worth $1000. There were no structures on the land, nor was it cleared for agricultural use. The 1870 Population and Agricultural Census. The family of four living on the property with only of improved land. No crops had been produced in their first year, but they had several animals, two milk cows, two other cattle and two swine. Their only farm production and possibly only source of income was 100 pounds of butter that had been produced. Meanwhile, John Oberg's farm also had improved and a higher production level, 10 bushels of Spring wheat, 25 bushels of Winter wheat and 1 bushel of Irish potatoes. The Obergs owned one swine, two milk cows and had produced 150 pounds of butter. There appears to be some confusion over whether the Chellbergs were actually on the 'farm site' or if it was the Obergs who were residents at the time of the census.Benz, 1‚Äì16: and US. Bureau of the Census. 1870 Manuscript Schedules, Ninth Census of Agriculture (microfilm copy on file at Indiana State Archives, Indianapolis, Indiana) Clearing the land would have been a slow process. In a good year, they might be able to clear only per year. It's more likely that they only cleared to a year. Clearing the land would produce sell-able lumber and cordwood, i.e., firewood. Most farms in the area were small and did a little of everything. The Chellbergs had an orchard which may have produced apples, pears, peaches, plums, cherries, grapes, strawberries, and raspberries.Cook, Sarah Gibbard and Robert S. Jackson.

Wicker. The house (prior to the current brick house) and the barn had been built between 1869 and 1872 when this additional land was obtained. It is assumed that the well and outhouse also built early for use by the family. By 1879 the farm included thirty poultry, eight cows, two sheep, eleven swine, and five horses. A chicken house was probably constructed between before 1879. Evidence also indicates that a corncrib may have been built prior to 1879. That year, the farm produced 100 bushels of Indian corn, from the cultivated. of Indian corn produced 100 bushels. of oats produced another forty bushels and of rye produced fifteen bushels. One hundred and twenty-two bushels of wheat came from . Hay is measured in tons, and five tons were harvested from . An area of was planted in Irish potatoes, which produced 75 bushels. The construction of the brick farmhouse in 1885 was a major addition to the farm. For many families the construction of a new, larger house would have indicated an improved level of prosperity, however, the Chellberg farmhouse was constructed as a direct result of the disastrous fire that consumed the original family home. The use of brick for the new house was more likely to be an attempt to guarantee that another fire would not threaten the family, than a display of a new level of wealth Second Generation at the Chellberg Farm, 1893‚Äì1908 Gravestone of Anders and Johanna KjellbergAnders Kjellberg was 63 when he died on April 16, 1893. His son, C. L. Chellberg became the owner of the farm when he bought his mother's and sister's inherited interest. C. L. paid $3500 to the two and agreed to shelter and feed them for the rest of their lives. C. L. took a more scientific approach to farming. He read The Farm Journal for a year, considered alternative approaches to farming and courted Ottomina Peterson. His scientific approach was furthered, beginning in 1896 when he subscribed to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Farmer's Bulletins. It is likely that C. L. Chellberg was in the process of developing the herd in 1901. After Emily Kjellberg married Alfred Borg in 1897, she and Alfred continued to live at the farm with their two children until 1901. Alfred was a carpenter and brick worker by trade so; he may have provided cash income by working off of the farm. In 1899 Johanna Kjellberg died at the age of 70. C. L. Chellberg and Emily and Alfred Borg continued to live in the farmhouse together until C. L. married Ottomina in 1901. Then, Emily and Alfred, with their children moved away. They lived with other relatives until ca. 1904 their home, Oak Hill Road and a ravine from the farm was completed. Chellberg Dairy Farm, 1908‚Äì1937 By 1908 the Chellbergs had switched from grain production to dairy and grain farm. The Chicago, South Bend and South Shore Railroad had been completed and a stop was only a mile away. With the daily train, they could sell milk to the dairy in East Chicago. Over the following years, the children of C.L. and Ottomina (Naomi and Carl) and their children continued to work on the farm. Naomi (1907‚Äì1988), moved away from the farm only after her marriage to Alden Studebaker in 1926. Even the grand children, Ann Chellberg Medley, daughter of Carl and Hilda Chellberg and Henry Studebaker and Arthur Studebaker, sons of Naomi Chellberg Studebaker and Alden Studebaker spent much of their childhood on the farm. Somewhere between 1920 and the 1930s, the dairy operation. It may have been when the South Shore closed its stop near farm or slowly over time as it became more difficult to get the milk to the train each day. Third Generation at the Chellberg Farm, 1937‚Äì1972 Old barn on the Chellberg FarmC. L. Chellberg's died in 1937. The farm was between his spouse and three children. His son Carl Chellberg took on the primary management of the farm, but everyone was actively involved in the decisions. They did not keep up with the changing economy as industry replaced farming as the mainstay of commerce. Like many farmers today (2008), he worked in town to make ends meet. Carl found employment in a machine shop in Chesterton. In 1938, Carl married Hilda Johnson. They had two children. The remodeled second floor of the farmhouse was an apartment where they and children lived. Minnie Chellberg died on November 15, 1952 at the age of 82. Minnie managed the house gardens, both the vegetable garden and the flowers in the front yard. She also oversaw the orchard. She also continued to raise chickens. Sometime in the 1940s Carl Chellberg began raising sheep and kept about 60 head. The sheep were sold at auctions for meat. The sheep grazed throughout the entire farm property and were kept in two sheep sheds that were constructed during this period. A large extension was built onto the south side of the barn in 1954. It was constructed by Carl Chellberg, Henry Studebaker, and Arthur Studebaker. Another sheep shed was constructed behind the granary. The building was smaller than the barn addition and constructed of corrugated iron. Eventually (sometime in the mid to late 1950s) Carl Chellberg took a job a machine shop in Chesterton and sold the sheep. Hilda Johnson Chellberg worked as a cook at a local restaurant. Once both Carl and Hilda had jobs off of the farm, the farm operation became a secondary effort and no longer the main family business.\\" Circa 1940 electricity was reestablished at the farm. It was used until the utility company power was brought to the farm in the 1940s after the war. During 1943, 1944, and 1945, Henry and Arthur Studebaker grew vegetables at the farm for sale to local residents. They had a garden in the eastern portion of the field south of the orchard and north of the current visitor center parking lot. They grew vegetables to sell door to door in Dune Acres. They grew asparagus, lima beans, yellow and green snap beans, beets, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, celery (white), kale, leaf lettuce, endive, cantaloupe, watermelons, okra, green onions, leeks, parsnips, peas, green and red peppers, red, white, and sweet potatoes, radishes, rhubarb, spinach, red rhubarb chard and white Swiss chard, Jerusalem and butternut squash, red and yellow tomatoes, turnips, rutabagas, kohl robi, cicely, sweet corn (yellow bantam and country gentleman), horseradish, dill, sage, chives, and parsley.

Diplomatic relations have been solid since Algeria's first years of independence. Greece maintains an embassy in Algiers, and Algeria is represented in Greece by its embassy in Athens. Trade between Greece and Algeria is increasing, with imports of natural gas from Algeria an important factor. There have been problems with illegal immigration from Algeria to Greece in recent years, and with Algerian trafficking of Sub Saharan Africans seeking to enter the European Union.  History  Phoenician and Greek colonies about 350 BC The maximum extent of Roman Empire under Trajan in 117 AD Bust of Ptolemy of Mauretania, c. 30‚Äì40 AD, grandson of the Ptolemaic Greek queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt. Louvre The first recorded contacts between Greeks and Algerians were struggles in the 5th century BC between the Phoenicians, who had settled in what is now Tunisia and Algeria with their capital at Carthage, and the Greek colony of Syracuse in Sicily. The capital of Numidia, Cirta (later renamed Constantine) was founded in 203 BC with the help of Greek colonists. The Greek historian Polybius discusses the wars that led to Carthage and Numidia becoming the Roman provinces of Africa and Mauretania. The Byzantine Empire during its greatest territorial extent under Justinian. c. 550. After almost 600 years as part of the Roman Empire, the territory that is now Algeria was occupied by the Vandals in 428 AD. In 533-534, the Greek general Belisarius defeated the Vandals, and Africa became a province of the Byzantine empire. In 535, the Greek emperor Justinian I made Sicily a Byzantine province. Ifriqiya at the beginning of the ninth century. The Arab forces of Caliph Uthman invaded Sicily in 652, without success, although the Arabs managed to drive the Greeks out of North Africa between 670 and 711 AD. A serious assault on Sicily was launched in 740 from Carthage, where the Arabs had built shipyards and a permanent base from which to make more sustained attacks, again without success. In 826, Ziyadat Allah the Emir of Ifriqiya sent an army that conquered the southern shore of the island and laid siege to Syracuse, but was forced to abandon the attempt due to plague. In 831 Berber units captured Palermo after a year-long siege.Previt√©-Orton (1971), vol. 1, pg. 370 Palermo became the Muslim capital of Sicily, renamed al-Madinah.Islam in Sicily , by Alwi Alatas Taormina fell in 902, but the Greeks clung onto territory in the island until 965. In 1061, after a successful campaign against the Byzantines in the south of Italy, the Norman Robert Guiscard invaded the Emirate of Sicily and captured Messina. After a prolonged campaign, the Normans completed the conquest of Sicily by 1091. The Norman Kingdom of Sicily developed a vibrant culture, and became a gateway that opened the world of Greek philosophy and Muslim science to Western Europe. (Later the Normans went on to sack and occupy Constantinople itself in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade.) Ottoman Empire at its greatest extent After the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453, most of Greece was subject to the Ottoman Empire until its declaration of independence in 1821. Algeria also became a province of the Ottoman Empire in 1517, captured by the half-Turkish Oru√ß Reis, who established the Barbary Corsairs. Algeria remained nominally subject to the Ottoman Empire until the French invasion of Algeria in 1830, but in practice was largely independent. The Barbary Corsairs, based in Algiers and other ports of the Barbary coast, were a severe threat to Mediterranean trade until their suppression in the early 19th century. Greek and Barbary pirates had close relations, with many Greeks sailing on Barbary ships. A substantial proportion of the Greek speaking inhabitants of Carg√®se emigrated to Sidi Merouane in Algeria between 1874 and 1876.; Of the total population of 1078 in 1872,. The population of the village was 1078 in 1872 but only 849 in 1876. it is estimated that 235 emigrated, all of them Greek speakers. Greece was among the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with Algeria after its independence in 1962, by upgrading the then Greek Consulate General in Algiers to an embassy in 1963. Official relations= Diplomatic contacts  The two Mediterranean countries have frequent high-level diplomatic contacts. In 1994, Algerian Foreign Minister Mohammed Salah Dembri visited Athens where he met his counterpart Karolos Papoulias and was received by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. They discussed bilateral relations and specifically discussed the Cyprus and Skopje issues. The Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs visited Greece in February 2001, returning a previous visit paid by the Foreign Minister of Greece to Algeria. In July 2002 Greek Minister of Development Akis Tsochatzopoulos and Algerian Energy Minister Chakib Khelil met to examine new ways of cooperation. In 2003, Greek [National] Defence Minister Ioannos Papandoniou visited Algeria to discuss ways to consolidate military cooperation between Algeria and Greece. In March 2008 the Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis visited Algiers where she met with Algeria‚Äôs President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and agreed to boost bilateral economic cooperation. In a message to Greek president Karolos Papoulias, Bouteflika said he wished to develop and deepen relationships between the two countries and to consult over issues related to security in the Mediterranean region.  Bilateral agreements  As of 2009, the two countries had in place 3 bilateral agreements: * Agreement on Economic, Scientific and Technical Cooperation (1982) * Agreement on Educational Cooperation (1988) * Agreement on Mutual Protection and Promotion of Investments (2000)  Economic relations  Natural gas pipelines in Greece. Revithoussa is near the southeast intersection. Since 2000, Algeria has supplied Greece with natural gas under a long-term agreement between the two countries. The liquefied natural gas is transported by special vessels to the Revithoussa LNG Terminal to the west of Athens. The exports of Algerian products to Greece amounted to $89 million in 2001, including mainly oil and oil derivatives, natural gas, inorganic chemicals, iron and steel. In the same year, Greek exports to Algeria amounted to $50.78 million, consisting mainly of cereals and related derivatives, tobacco products, pharmaceuticals, medical and non-ferrous minerals. By 2006, total trade volumes had risen to US$410.2 million. In 2007, Algeria was ranked 6th among Greece's Arab trade partners. In 2008, a high-ranking delegation of Algerian government and business officials from sectors such as ports management, construction, public works, banking and finance as well as energy, and around 60 Greek delegates held a forum on Greek-Algerian economic cooperation in Athens.  Migration  As Spain and Italy are taking increasingly tough measures to restrict illegal migrants from the Middle East and Africa, growing numbers are entering the EU through Greece. In 2007, Greece arrested 112,000 illegal immigrants, up from 40,000 in 2005. The influx of illegal migrants is causing rising violence in Athens. Newly arrived refugees from conflict zones in the Middle East and Africa are being exploited by established gangs of Nigerians, Moroccans and Algerians, who engaged in street battles in downtown Athens in 2008. In May 2009, 500 illegal immigrants in Athens, mostly from Algeria and Tunisia, were besieged by a crowd of Neo-Nazi Greeks inside an abandoned eight floor building with no water and electricity. Earlier in the year, Turkish police arrested a group of 120 Algerian illegal immigrants who were trying to cross the border into Greece. The Turkish town of Adana has become a popular transit point for Algerian illegal immigrants. Algeria is also a staging post for trade in migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa. The U.S. Department of State describes Algeria as a transit country for men and women trafficked from sub- Saharan Africa to Europe for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor.

A path is called simple if it does not have any repeated vertices; the length of a path may either be measured by its number of edges, or (in weighted graphs) by the sum of the weights of its edges. In contrast to the shortest path problem, which can be solved in polynomial time in graphs without negative- weight cycles, the longest path problem is NP-hard and the decision version of the problem, which asks whether a path exists of at least some given length, is NP-complete. This means that the decision problem cannot be solved in polynomial time for arbitrary graphs unless P = NP. Stronger hardness results are also known showing that it is difficult to approximate. However, it has a linear time solution for directed acyclic graphs, which has important applications in finding the critical path in scheduling problems. NP- hardness The NP-hardness of the unweighted longest path problem can be shown using a reduction from the Hamiltonian path problem: a graph G has a Hamiltonian path if and only if its longest path has length n ‚àí 1, where n is the number of vertices in G. Because the Hamiltonian path problem is NP- complete, this reduction shows that the decision version of the longest path problem is also NP-complete. In this decision problem, the input is a graph G and a number k; the desired output is \\"yes\\" if G contains a path of k or more edges, and no otherwise.. If the longest path problem could be solved in polynomial time, it could be used to solve this decision problem, by finding a longest path and then comparing its length to the number k. Therefore, the longest path problem is NP-hard. The question \\"does there exist a simple path in a given graph with at least k edges\\" is NP-complete.. In weighted complete graphs with non-negative edge weights, the weighted longest path problem is the same as the Travelling salesman path problem, because the longest path always includes all vertices.. Acyclic graphs and critical paths A longest path between two given vertices s and t in a weighted graph G is the same thing as a shortest path in a graph ‚àíG derived from G by changing every weight to its negation. Therefore, if shortest paths can be found in ‚àíG, then longest paths can also be found in G. For most graphs, this transformation is not useful because it creates cycles of negative length in ‚àíG. But if G is a directed acyclic graph, then no negative cycles can be created, and a longest path in G can be found in linear time by applying a linear time algorithm for shortest paths in ‚àíG, which is also a directed acyclic graph.. For instance, for each vertex v in a given DAG, the length of the longest path ending at v may be obtained by the following steps: # Find a topological ordering of the given DAG. # For each vertex v of the DAG, in the topological ordering, compute the length of the longest path ending at v by looking at its incoming neighbors and adding one to the maximum length recorded for those neighbors. If v has no incoming neighbors, set the length of the longest path ending at v to zero. In either case, record this number so that later steps of the algorithm can access it. Once this has been done, the longest path in the whole DAG may be obtained by starting at the vertex v with the largest recorded value, then repeatedly stepping backwards to its incoming neighbor with the largest recorded value, and reversing the sequence of vertices found in this way. The critical path method for scheduling a set of activities involves the construction of a directed acyclic graph in which the vertices represent project milestones and the edges represent activities that must be performed after one milestone and before another; each edge is weighted by an estimate of the amount of time the corresponding activity will take to complete. In such a graph, the longest path from the first milestone to the last one is the critical path, which describes the total time for completing the project. Longest paths of directed acyclic graphs may also be applied in layered graph drawing: assigning each vertex v of a directed acyclic graph G to the layer whose number is the length of the longest path ending at v results in a layer assignment for G with the minimum possible number of layers.. Approximation write that the longest path problem in unweighted undirected graphs \\"is notorious for the difficulty of understanding its approximation hardness\\".. The best polynomial time approximation algorithm known for this case achieves only a very weak approximation ratio, n/\\\\exp(\\\\Omega(\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n})).. For earlier work with even weaker approximation bounds, see and . For all \\\\epsilon>0, it is not possible to approximate the longest path to within a factor of 2^{(\\\\log n)^{1-\\\\epsilon}} unless NP is contained within quasi-polynomial deterministic time; however, there is a big gap between this inapproximability result and the known approximation algorithms for this problem.. In the case of unweighted but directed graphs, strong inapproximability results are known. For every \\\\epsilon>0 the problem cannot be approximated to within a factor of n^{1-\\\\epsilon} unless P = NP, and with stronger complexity-theoretic assumptions it cannot be approximated to within a factor of n/\\\\log^{2+\\\\epsilon} n. The color-coding technique can be used to find paths of logarithmic length, if they exist, but this gives an approximation ratio of only O(n/\\\\log n).. Parameterized complexity The longest path problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the length of the path. For instance, it can be solved in time linear in the size of the input graph (but exponential in the length of the path), by an algorithm that performs the following steps: # Perform a depth-first search of the graph. Let d be the depth of the resulting depth-first search tree. # Use the sequence of root-to- leaf paths of the depth-first search tree, in the order in which they were traversed by the search, to construct a path decomposition of the graph, with pathwidth d. # Apply dynamic programming to this path decomposition to find a longest path in time O(d!2^dn), where n is the number of vertices in the graph. Since the output path has length at least as large as d, the running time is also bounded by O(\\\\ell!2^\\\\ell n), where \\\\ell is the length of the longest path.. For an earlier FPT algorithm with slightly better dependence on the path length, but worse dependence on the size of the graph, see . Using color-coding, the dependence on path length can be reduced to singly exponential.... A similar dynamic programming technique shows that the longest path problem is also fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the treewidth of the graph. For graphs of bounded clique-width, the longest path can also be solved by a polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm. However, the exponent of the polynomial depends on the clique-width of the graph, so this algorithms is not fixed-parameter tractable. The longest path problem, parameterized by clique-width, is hard for the parameterized complexity class W[1], showing that a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm is unlikely to exist.. Special classes of graphs A linear-time algorithm for finding a longest path in a tree was proposed by Dijkstra in 1960's, while a formal proof of this algorithm was published in 2002.. Furthermore, a longest path can be computed in polynomial time on weighted trees, on block graphs, on cacti,. on bipartite permutation graphs,. and on Ptolemaic graphs.. For the class of interval graphs, an O(n^4)-time algorithm is known, which uses a dynamic programming approach.. This dynamic programming approach has been exploited to obtain polynomial-time algorithms on the greater classes of circular-arc graphs. and of co-comparability graphs (i.e. of the complements of comparability graphs, which also contain permutation graphs),. both having the same running time O(n^4). The latter algorithm is based on special properties of the lexicographic depth first search (LDFS) vertex ordering. of co-comparability graphs. For co-comparability graphs also an alternative polynomial-time algorithm with higher running time O(n^7) is known, which is based on the Hasse diagram of the partially ordered set defined by the complement of the input co-comparability graph.. Furthermore, the longest path problem is solvable in polynomial time on any class of graphs with bounded treewidth or bounded clique-width, such as the distance-hereditary graphs. Finally, it is clearly NP-hard on all graph classes on which the Hamiltonian path problem is NP-hard, such as on split graphs, circle graphs, and planar graphs.

The BFSR has been designed by DRDO's Bangalore-based laboratory, the Electronics and Radar Development Establishment (LRDE) and is being manufactured by Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL).LRDE Achievements on LRDE Website BFSR has found use in the Indian border areas, especially along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir to prevent infiltration. Over 1100 units are in use by the Indian Army. Foreign Countries have also placed orders for the BFSR. Bharat Electronics eyes 15 pc sales growth, The Hindu Business Line, 12 April 2004. Over 1,400 BFSRs are now being used by the Army against moving surface targets. A BFSR radar that offers foliage penetration is under development.  Development  In the aftermath of the Kargil War, and with the heightened levels of infiltration, the Indian Army started looking at electronic sensors to augment the surveillance capabilities. One of the technologies identified was a small, surveillance radar, and the Army projected its requirements to LRDE shortly after. Sanction was given to DRDO to develop an indigenous radar. In the meantime, some Battle Field Surveillance radars (SR) were imported from Israel at a cost of 800 million, pending completion of the project.Harinder Baweja, Defenceless Delays , India Today, 7 May 2001Enhancing the fire power of Infantry units, Press Information Bureau, Government of India, 17 December 2003. This accompanied a large-scale induction of high tech equipment for the Indian Armed Forces. The radar was designed and developed by LRDE, a DRDO unit, and manufactured by BEL. Initiated in 2000, the development was carried out in LRDE, with the Project Director being Dr. S. Varadarajan, and with BEL collaboration. The project was a systematic example of concurrent engineering, with the production agency involved through the design and development stage. This enabled the design to be brought into production quickly. A salient feature of the BFSR programme was the high level of involvement of the Indian private sector, a first for defence programmes in India. Private firms supplied the rotational assembly and tripod, the Control and display unit as well as electronics assemblies after design and technology transfer by LRDE. This has continued into the substantial production run. The radar was ready for trials in early 2002,Forty four glorious years in defence research generations, Press Information Bureau, Government of India, 1 January 2002. and after extensive trials in Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir, it was accepted in July 2002, 24 months after development work commenced.Anantha Krishnan M., Scientists develop radar to check infiltration, Times of India, 4 July 2002.  Description  BFSR-SR with the display unit BFSR is a man portable, lightweight, battery operated, surveillance radar. Weighing around 30 kg, it can be carried and operated by two or three-man teams.BFSR Brochure from Aero India-2007 . Image from Bharat Rakshak. The BFSR is a fully coherent Pulse Doppler radar, operating with a 10% duty cycle, and a 5W peak power. The low peak power provides the radar a low probability of intercept (LPI), making it difficult to detect by enemy sensors. The radar operates over 21 channels in J band (10 to 18/20 GHz). It can be operated in all weather conditions, and during day and night. BFSR-SR components include a mounting tripod, an antenna/electronics assembly, two 24 V batteries for power, and an integrated control and display unit (CDU).Battlefield Surveillance Radar - Short/Medium Range from Jane's Defence. Targets are classified automatically using Doppler target classification, with output Doppler return being channelled to the operator through headphones for the Doppler audio. The radar operates on two rechargeable 24 V batteries, which are carried separately by the soldiers. They can also be operated from AC supply. The batteries are usually suspended from the tripod to provide extra stability to the radar, although they can be kept separately.  Radar array and hardware  The radar array consists of J-band Transmit, receive and processing modules within the single array block. The signal processor is a single on-board FPGA-based chip, which has been tailored for very low power consumption.DRDO Newsletter, August 2004. The antenna array is made up of microstrip patch array antennas.DRDO Newsletter, August 2005. The transmitter is a solid state transmit module, while the separate receiver is a super-heterodyne type receiver. The radar algorithm incorporates Digital Pulse compression Technology, which improves the LPI characteristics, as well as making the radar more accurate. This technology was developed in-house by LRDE, which constituted a major breakthrough for Indian radar technology.  Display  The BFSR processing and display units, and control functions are integrated on a single, touch-sensitive, portable IBM PC, called the Control and Display Unit (CDU). Some processing elements are also built into the radar. The processed information is displayed on a high resolution 10.4\\" LCD colour display. The PC operates on a Windows NT-based, menu-driven user interface, which makes operating the BFSR extremely simple. A high-resolution, north-oriented, coloured radar picture is displayed on PC display. The radar display can either be in a Plan position indicators (PPI) display, or a B-Scope display. The display also has provision for digital geographic map overlay, which allows the target data to be integrated with tactical data for use by ground forces and commanders. Different geographical maps can be overlaid on the radar display. A target position can be marked for further investigation, or combing of the area by ground forces. The interface between the radar and the CDU can be either RS232C or LAN connectivity. A lightweight, rugged, standard army 2-wire field cable is used for communicating between the radar and CDU. This allows the operators to be positioned up to 100 m away from the radar, in the safety of trenches, bunkers, or hides. This provides them better security and safety, and allows for greater flexibility in deploying the radar at suitable spots to meet technical and tactical requirements. The use of wired interface also provides a better security from interception and lower noise, and does not require the radar and CDU to be within Line-of-Sight of each other.  Networking  The BFSR has a COTS- based built in networking and sensor fusion to increase the effectiveness of surveillance. Up to 10 radars may be networked at one time to provide greater area of coverage. All radars in a network can also be remotely controlled from a central hub. Provision to Network various radars for wider area coverage has also been built into the BFSR.  Thermal imager  A third generation thermal imager has also been configured for use on the BFSR and has been integrated with it (as shown in the image in the infobox). Operating in the Mid-wavelength Infrared (MWIR) spectrum (3-5 micrometre wavelengths), the imager has a single field of view (monocular sighting) This has given the BFSR day and night viewing capability. All BFSR data and images, both radar as well as thermal data are combined and displayed on the common control and display unit (CDU). Thus, the radar can integrate its display with IR sensor output, which improves the overall efficacy of the system. The radar continues to progress further in terms of integration with more features being added. To aid in sensor fusion, and increase the effectiveness of surveillance, newer variants are also being networked with the Indian Army's Hand-held Thermal Imagers (HHTIs) for visually tracking targets detected by the radar.  Operation  The BFSR has been designed for fast deployment, with a setup time of less than 5 minutes. The radar has an inbuilt GPS for self location and alignment with the digital map. It also has a built-in digital magnetic compass which can automatically align the radar to the North.BFSR Information board from Bharat Rakshak.com. This ensures that the precise location of targets is measured. = Modes of operation = The radar can be operated in various modes - Surveillance/Scanning (\\"Search\\"), acquisition, tracking/classification mode. The radar can also be operated manually, or put into an automated \\"Standby\\" mode. BFSR also has integrated calibration and maintenance modes, which aids in easy maintenance and testing on the field. Additionally, the radar also contains a built-in training simulator, which aids in the training of operators without the need to extensive training facilities. Further training modules can be easily loaded on to the PC. The built-in test equipment (BITE) on the BFSR aids in increasing reliability and allowing for easy calibration and fault detection of the radar on the field. The various modes are remotely configurable from the CDU by the operator, which allows for different modes of operations without any physical changes on the BFSR, and without needing the operator to expose himself to any danger. The operation can also be remotely controlled for networked radars. In scanning mode, the radar can scan around a specified sector looking for any moving objects. It is also capable of \\"Track-while- Scan\\" (TWS) operation, and can track 50 targets in TWS acquisition mode. The speed of scan can also be adjusted by adjusting the speed of the antenna's rotation to either a low, medium or high rotational speed. If a target is found, the operator can choose to track that target in the dedicated tracking mode. The Doppler return from the target is then processed, and fed into the operator's headphones to aid in classification. A classification algorithm in the radar also automatically classifies the into crawling target, single moving target, group of men, light vehicle, heavy vehicle and helicopter. The radar can also be vehicle or mast-mounted, to increase the detection capabilities.Battle Field Surveillance Radar from DRDO Technology Focus, Vol. 10, No. 5, October 2002. For mobility, better range, and for overcoming obstructions and ground reflection, a vehicle mounted version of BFSR has been developed. The radar array is mounted on a 6 meter long telescopic mast on a jeep or truck platform.  Applications  BFSR is designed keeping in mind the requirements of border surveillance and intruder detection. Thus, it is an ideal tool for border surveillance and protection. It can also be used for battlefield surveillance and intelligence gathering by scouts, forward observers and Special Forces units. It can also be used as a low-cost solution for detection of low flying helicopters and boats by smaller infantry units, enabling in better protection in the absence of larger air-defence radars. The BFSR has been mainly used by the Indian Army for surveillance of designated areas and borders, for the prevention of infiltration and illegal immigration. It can also be used for perimeter surveillance and protection of sensitive sites, industrial facilities, power plants and similar sites.  Status  BFSR-SR is currently being used extensively by the Indian Army, which has employed it in the border areas with Pakistan and Bangladesh for surveillance and prevention of infiltration. In 2004, 1176 units were ordered by the Indian Army for . 5.51 billion (US$125 mn) and were delivered within 18 months.BEL begins export of Radars to Indonesia & Sudan the Indian Border Security Force has also inducted these radars for border surveillance.  Foreign sales  BEL is heavily promoting the BFSR as a major product to foreign customers in order to improve its international defence presence. At 4-5 millions per unit, the BFSR costs a third of the price of comparable western systems.Battle field surveillance radar to be deployed , Daily Excelsior, 2 August 2003. The BFSR has also notched up foreign sales, with Indonesia ordering 100 units and Sudan ordering 10 radars. In fact, Indonesia was the first customer to receive the radars, even before the Indian Army. Mozambique has also bought some radars for trials. BEL is looking at Sri Lanka, Uzbekistan and some other countries for potential sales. There have been serious sales enquiries from at least 5 countries.

The Core and Food indexes are compiled across both geographic sets. The All Items index is compiled only for metropolitan areas. CPI minus mortgage costs (CPIX) is compiled only for both metropolitan and urban areas.Statistics South Africa  All items index  The All Items index encompasses 12 categories of consumer expenses: * Food and non-alcoholic beverages * Alcoholic beverages and tobacco * Clothing and footwear * Housing and utilities * Household contents, equipment and maintenance * Health * Transport * Communication * Recreation and culture * Education * Restaurants and hotels * Miscellaneous goods and services, including insurance and financial services  Core index  The Core index excludes five price sets considered to be particularly volatile. These are: * Fresh and frozen meat and fish (excluded because of climatic volatility); * Fresh and frozen vegetables and fresh fruit and nuts (excluded because of seasonal volatility); * Overdrafts/personal loans (excluded because of a \\"perverse effect on the CPI\\"); * Changes in Value Added Tax (excluded because VAT rates are set by government fiscal policy); * Property tax assessment rates (excluded because rates are set by local government).Statistics South Africa(2) Food index The Food index is derived by excluding everything but food from the CPI basket of goods and services.

CPIX CPIX is measured by excluding one section of the CPI basket of goods and services, the owner's equivalent rent, from the calculation. January 2009 changes In January 2009 Statistics South Africa changed the naming and composition of headline CPI measures, effectively replacing CPIX as the measure for government inflation targeting. The weighting of items in the basket was also changed, with certain items excluded and new items introduced, and a broader range of prices are collected for individual items.

In addition, Ugarit in Syria had also contact with Messinia and the Minoan civilization, until it was destroyed by the Sea People. Hellenistic era Macedonian Greek king, Alexander the Great conquered Syria and the region in 333‚Äì332 BCE. Afterwards, Seleucus led the Seleucid Empire to rule Syria, which lasted until 64 BCE. In Syria, Seleucids had many achievements such as building cities like Antioch, Laodicea, and Apamea, in addition to laying the foundations to Aleppo Citadel. Late on, the Byzantine Empire kept the Greek influence until mid-7th century, in which they developed the Norias of Hama. During the Byzantine rule, the Eastern Orthodox Church was the common religion between the nations, which still has 503,000 members in Syria. Pre-WWI Both Greece and Syria were occupied by the Ottoman Empire for more than four centuries. Modern era During the WWII, many Greeks fled their country after the Nazi invasion, mainly from the island of Chios to seek refuge in Al-Nayrab camp, near Aleppo.

It was released on July 30, 2008 in the Arab World, and August 1 of the same year elsewhere through In2Musica, to reach remarkable career-defining success that none of Ajram's previous records had achieved. Betfakkar Fi Eih produced several hits which continued Ajram's reign as the artist with most number-one hits in the history of the modern Arab music industry. The lead single and title track was a change in the sound of Ajram welcomed by critics and fans. The album, just like its predecessor Ya Tabtab...Wa Dallaa also featured product placement as a tool to promote many of its songs, including \\"Meen Ghairy Ana,\\" \\"Wana Ben Idek\\" and \\"Lamset Eed.\\" The latter being an ad for Sony Ericson smartphones, with which Ajram made a deal upon dropping the album. Other singles include \\"Mashi Haddi,\\" which became a big hit in the summer of 2009. The album brought Ajram to global recognition, when she returned home from the 2008 World Music Awards with the trophy for the best selling Middle Eastern act. Ajram is the youngest Arabian act to score a WMA. Production and changes In June 2008, Jiji announced the filming of a video for a song called \\"Aktar W Aktar\\" (Sahharny Sahhar) which was rumored to have been the old album title. However, \\"Betfakkar Fi Eih\\" then became the lead single and album title. \\"Biteegy Sirtak\\" was rumored to have been a 15-minute-long song, as mentioned by Samir Sfeir himself and Nancy Ajram, but the album version was edited down to 6 minutes for radio broadcast. In January 2007, news about \\"Ibn El Giran\\" (The Neighbor's Son) had leaked and it was mentioned that Nadine Labaki was to film it as her music video comeback. She had reportedly met with Hamid elChaery (song's arranger) for suggestions that would match the music video. However, Nadine did not direct any music videos for three years ahead, and \\"Ibn El Giran\\" was later directed by British director, Mike Harris. Also, \\"Zaman Kan Andi Alb\\" (I Used to Have a Heart) is strongly rumored to be directted by Nadine Labaki, to supposedly sequel \\"Inta Eyh\\". However, in mid 2009 rumors had it that the song will be directed by Yehya Saade, preceded by the Khaliji song of the album, \\"Khaffef Alayya\\". This led to complaints from fans, first due to the choice of Yehya as a director, especially after the release of several controversial clips by him. The choice of \\"Khaffef\\" was also not well-received, since this song did not catch as much attention as Nancy's previous Khaliji hit \\"Mishtaga Leik\\". Zaman Kan Andi Alb's music video still remains in question. The song is the second creation of Samir Sfeir and Tarek Madkoor in the album, after \\"Meen Ghayri Ana\\" which fans highly requested a music video for. Due to all these reasons, Nancy decided in November 2009 to cancel filming \\"Khaffef\\" and to film \\"Meen Ghayri Ana\\" instead, thus satisfying huge fan demand cleverly, keeping Yehya as the director of the clip. However, later on, fans were surprised to see that none of the songs mentioned were filmed as music videos, in spite of official statements with set filming dates and crew. Artwork A promotional picture from the Betfakkar Fi Eih photoshoot showing Ajram sitting at the back of a car. The album includes two different photoshoots by David Abdallah, whom Ajram constantly works with. As opposed to her previous typical-photoshoot album covers which did not achieve satisfaction, this album's was generally Ajram's most liked cover by the public. The cover shoot showed Ajram sitting at the back of a car, staring mysteriously outside the window, or simply with her eyes closed, appearing to be deep in thought and imagination. The cover came to match the album's theme of change and maturity, as it serves to impose the question of the album title, \\"Betfakkar Fi Eih\\" (What Are You Thinking About?). In the other shoot included in the inlay booklet, Ajram poses in common photoshoot style, with rose petals flying all around her. The three different looks in the shoots and the three different hairstyles in the car shoot were the work of her make-up artist, Fady Kataya, and hairdresser, Wassim Morkos from Pace e Luce, respectively. The artwork was designed by Lebanese artist Georges Yucef, who have previously designed Ah W Noss and Ya Tabtab...Wa Dallaa album covers. The album booklet contains full Arabic lyrics to the songs. Musical composition Ajram chose the album title track \\"Betfakkar Fi Eih\\" (What Are You Thinking About?) because its meaning described the change in the album. The first preview of the album was from the hit \\"Meen Ghairy Ana\\" in Ajram's three part Coke commercial, which served as a very successful promotion 5 months before release. Even though \\"Meen Ghairy Ana\\" is considered by many to be the smash hit of the album, the choice of the lead single was to be the album title track as usual, which did not satisfy all critics. Along with the album's release came a high budget video for \\"Betfakkar Fi Eih\\" with hi-tech effects that marked a first in the Arab world. Tarek Madkour, produced three tracks in the album including the title track. Ajram, before the album's release was rumored to have already filmed \\"Meen Ghairy Ana\\" and \\"Ibn El Giran\\". \\"Meen Ghairy Ana\\", by the successful trio, Nizar Francis, Samir Sfeir and Tarek Madkour who previously created Ajram's smash hits \\"Yay\\" and \\"Ana Yalli\\", is an upbeat romantic song which was used for the 2008 Coca-Cola campaign in the Middle East. In the song, Madkour's brand new Western formula of beats and instruments created a unique and \\"colorful\\" style for Ajram; a much richer mix than the simple, yet unique electric guitar he included in the album's hit \\"Betfakkar Fi Eih\\", from which the video's whole style was inspired. Ajram also continues her drama of \\"Inta Eyh\\" from Ah W Noss with a sequel in this album. In \\"Zaman Kan Andi Alb\\" (I Used to Have a Heart), the sad heartbroken wife who once made sure to be smiling to her cheating husband has a change of heart, or more accurately a loss of one. In the song, Ajram faces him with the truth she was hiding in the old song and video and announces that she no longer has a heart like before to love him. The song is also by Samir Sfeir and Tarek Madkoor, who this time chose to create a simpler mix to the song that focuses on Sfeir's tune and shows a wide vocal range for Ajram. Egyptian singer and songwriter Mustafa Kamel, wrote \\"Biteegy Sirtak\\". The most successful song in radio stations upon release of the album is most probably \\"Lamset Eed\\" (Touch of a Hand), a very romantic song with deep, sad feelings. The song, by the same trio, Fares Iskandar, Salim Salama and Hadi Sharara, who created Ajram's previous hit \\"Ehsas Jdeed\\", shows a maturity in her style and a convincing singing of feelings. In \\"Min Dally Nseek\\", the second video of the album, Ajram contributed in forming a first-time collaboration between Egyptian composer Walid Saad and Lebanese music producer Hadi Sharara who created a fast, different and new mix for the song for which he praised Ajram for making a \\"brave\\" choice. Another romantic rock power ballad song is \\"Wana Ben Ideik\\" which shows Ajram's deep convincing feelings towards her lover. This is Ajram's second cooperation with Egyptian composer Mahmoud Khayami after \\"Baddallaa' Aleik\\" in Ah W Noss. In \\"Mashi Haddi\\", Ajram returns to Lebanese folkore last seen in her 2001 album Sheel Oyoonak Anni, but this time with a fast oldies style that takes a great credit for the album's uniqueness. Ajram also sings an old Egyptian style in \\"Ibn El Giran\\" where she performs a short \\"Mawwal\\" at the end of the song for the first time since \\"Baddalla' Aleik\\" in Ah W Noss. Another fast Egyptian song by Mohammed Rahim is \\"Sahharny Sahhar\\" which was rumored to have been the old title of the album. Probably the most remarkable feature of this song is that it is a Tarab song by Samir Sfeir \\"Biteegy Sirtak\\". Ajram who always performs Tarab for other singers in her concerts finally included her own track after the 1998 tracks of her debut album Mihtagalak. The song, which was originally 15 minutes long had to be edited down to 6 minutes for radio stations to be able to play it all.  Genre  In Betfakkar Fi Eih, Ajram performed the widest variety of styles in comparison with her previous albums, many of which were completely new to her. To categorize the most significant: *Pop: \\"Betfakkar Fi Eih\\", \\"Meen Ghayri Ana\\", \\"Min Dally Nseek\\" *Egyptian/Bellydance/Maksoum: \\"Sahharny Sahhar\\", \\"Baladiyyat\\", \\"Ibn El Giran\\" *Ballad: \\"Wana Ben Ideik\\", \\"Zaman Kan Andi Alb\\", \\"Lamset Eed\\", \\"Leya Haq\\" *Khaliji (Gulf): \\"Khaffef Alayya\\" *Tarab/Modern Tarab: \\"Biteegy Sirtak\\", \\"Safer\\" *Oldies Pop: \\"Mashi Haddi\\" (80's Lebanese pop), \\"Ibn El Giran\\" (includes short \\"Mawwal\\")  Singles =Promotional Singles  *\\"Meen Ghairy Ana (Nos El Kawn)\\" - 3 Coca-Cola Commercials (instrumental version, a cappella version, album version) :Director: Manfredo Leteo *\\"Ibn El Giran\\" - Damas Jewellery (Farfasha)/World Gold Council :Director: Mike Harris *\\"Wana Ben Ideik\\" and Betfakkar Fi Eih\\" - 3 Sony Ericsson Commercials :Director: Leila Kanaan Music Videos * The title track and lead single \\"Betfakkar Fi Eih\\" was released on July 19, 2008.

Other charted songs * \\"Meen Ghairy Ana\\" was delivered through a series of three Coke commercials in March 2008 as part of the official Middle East Coca-Cola song of the year. Alternatively known as \\"Noss el Kawn\\", the song topped several charts and served as a successful promotion for the album's official release. \\"Meen Ghairy Ana\\" has been sampled by several artists and translated into Hebrew and Persian. * \\"Wana Ben Ideik\\" was released as a promotional single, it was used in commercials for Sony Ericsson in which Nancy was the new spokesperson for, the commercial was directed by Leila Kanaan. The song received remarkable attention globally and was remixed by several international DJ's including Space Cowboy. * \\"Sahharny Sahhar\\", rumored to have been scheduled as the lead single, charted at #56 on Radio Panorama FM even though never released as a single. Nancy later performed the song on the final episode of \\"The Manager\\". * \\"Zaman Kan Andi Alb\\" was scheduled to be released as the final single from the album, but this project had been cancelled due to several reasons, mainly Nancy's pregnancy. It was announced to be a sequel to Nancy's previous smash hit \\"Inta Eyh\\", and charted on several radio stations. * \\"Baladiyyat\\" charted on several stations and was promoted on TV as a live performance. * \\"Biteegy Sertak\\" was a radio hit. Many stations considered it a new, unique move in Nancy's career. A video of a live performance of the song was played by many TV channels.  Track listing  Standard edition Tour The album was widely promoted by Nancy's 2008 world tour. The tour became Nancy's first to feature legs outside the Arab World.

Betfakkar Fi Eih was the most selling album in the Arab world (Middle East and North Africa) for the year 2008, even though there were huge competitors at that same year including Nawal Al Zoghbi, Elissa, Ragheb Alama, Tamer Hosny, Samira Said, Marwan Khoury, Myriam Fares, Haifa Wehbe, Mohamed Hamaki, Amal Hijazi, all of whom released comeback albums in the same year. In addition to the WMA, another award the album won was the Student's Choice Award based on a voting survey carried between over 8,000 Lebanese college students who voted it as album of the year. Betfakkar Fi Eih peaked at #1 for 7 consecutive weeks in Beirut Virgin Megastores, and still continues to top charts around the Arab world, occupying #1 in Weekly Sales Charts numerous times in Beirut, Dubai, Egypt, Syria & Jordan, and online sources. In the lead hit video, prominent director Said El Marouk was thoroughly criticized for focusing on high-level effects and styles rather than a coherent storyboard for the clip. However, Betfakkar Fi Eih was nevertheless voted #2 for the best video of 2008 in an online survey by Stars Cafe.Stars Cafe Annual Survey 2008 (accessed January 8, 2009) Min Dally Nseek on the other hand, which came three months later and also by Saeed, peaked at #1 for seven consecutive weeks in Melody Hits Top Music Videos and Top Songs.Melody Hits (accessed January 8, 2009) Two months upon release, many then-unfilmed songs achieved huge success among the public and acquired \\"smash-hit status\\", including the album's promo song 5 months pre- release, \\"Meen Ghayri Ana\\", as well as the instant radio-hits \\"Lamset Eed\\", \\"Mashi Haddi\\", \\"Wana Bin Idek\\", \\"Sahharny Sahhar\\", and the first two singles, \\"Betfakkar Fi Eih\\" and \\"Min Dally Nseek\\". Due to huge amount of video requests for different songs, Nancy announced that she will be filming about 10 music videos from the 14 songs of the album. Betfakkar Fi Eih broke the record in HitMarker's Top 10 best-selling Arabic album charts by remaining for 54 consecutive weeks in the list since the date of its release. The album's singles and music videos, including the title track, have all reached #1 spots at Hitmarker, the only official pan-Arab music charts that are the trusted source for the WMA's.

The Basset force term describes the force due to the lagging boundary layer development with changing relative velocity (acceleration) of bodies moving through a fluid.C. Crowe et al., Multiphase flows with droplets and particles, CRC Press, 1998, , p. 81 The Basset term accounts for viscous effects and addresses the temporal delay in boundary layer development as the relative velocity changes with time. It is also known as the \\"history\\" term. The Basset force is difficult to implement and is commonly neglected for practical reasons; however, it can be substantially large when the body is accelerated at a high rate.R.W. Johnson, The handbook of fluid dynamics, CRC Press, 1998, , pp. 18‚Äì3 This force in an accelerating Stokes flow has been proposed by Joseph Valentin Boussinesq in 1885 and Alfred Barnard Basset in 1888. Consequently, it is also referred to as the Boussinesq‚ÄìBasset force. Acceleration of a flat plate Consider an infinitely large plate started impulsively with a step change in velocity‚Äîfrom 0 to u0‚Äîin the direction of the plate‚Äìfluid interface plane. The equation of motion for the fluid‚ÄîStokes flow at low Reynolds number‚Äîis :\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t}= u_c\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2u}{\\\\partial y^2}, where u(y,t) is the velocity of the fluid, at some time t, parallel to the plate, at a distance y from the plate, and ŒΩc is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid (c~continuous phase). The solution to this equation is, :u=u_0 - u_0\\\\, \\\\operatorname{erf}\\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{2\\\\sqrt{ u_ct}}\\\\right) = u_0 \\\\operatorname{erfc}\\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{2\\\\sqrt{ u_ct}}\\\\right), where erf and erfc denote the error function and the complementary error function, respectively. Assuming that an acceleration of the plate can be broken up into a series of such step changes in the velocity, it can be shown that the cumulative effect on the shear stress on the plate is :\\\\tau=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\rho_c\\\\mu_c}{\\\\pi}}\\\\int\\\\limits_0^t\\\\frac{\\\\frac{\\\\partial u_p}{\\\\partial t'}}{\\\\sqrt{t-t'}} \\\\, dt', where up(t) is the velocity of the plate, œÅc is the mass density of the fluid, and Œºc is the viscosity of the fluid. Acceleration of a spherical particle Boussinesq (1885) and Basset (1888) found that the force F on an accelerating spherical particle in a viscous fluid is :\\\\mathbf{F}=\\\\frac{3}{2}D^2\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi\\\\rho_c\\\\mu_c}\\\\int\\\\limits_0^t\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\mathbf{u}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{u}}{\\\\partial t'}-\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{v}}{\\\\partial t'}}{\\\\sqrt{t-t'}}dt', where D is the particle diameter, and u and v are the fluid and particle velocity vectors, respectively.

Peter Edmund Jones M.D. (30 October 1843 - 29 June 1909) was a Mississauga Ojibwa chief of New Credit. In Ojibwe he was called Kahkewaquonaby, named after his father in two languages. The third child of Peter Jones and Eliza Field, Jones was born in London, Canada West. He was raised at the Muncey Mission, and later Brantford. He was educated first by his governess, and later at Brantford Grammar School. Although one quarter indigenous in heritage, he was raised in a largely western fashion. Jones, who attended medical school at the University of Toronto and Queen's College, obtained a Medical Doctorate in 1866. He is the first known Status Indian to obtain such a degree in Canada. After obtaining his medical degree, Jones moved to Hagersville, Ontario and set up a practice in New Credit. Jones became involved in politics, both on the reserve and off. He was elected a chief of New Credit from 1874‚Äì1877, and 1880-1886. He developed connections in the Conservative Party of Canada, where he argued for more Native rights and more Native control over their affairs. Unsuccessful in this, he did receive an appointment as the Indian Agent for New Credit in 1887, which he held until 1896. Jones edited The Indian, a journal for indigenous people. The journal was published in 1885-1886, and ran a total of 24 issues. It was the first Canadian journal for indigenous people edited by an indigenous person. The journal was distributed on Indian Reserves across Ontario. Like his father, Jones lived across the cultural gap between the whites of Canada and the indigenous people of the land. He married an English woman, Charlotte Dixon, but intended to raise any children as Ojibwe. His cousin George Henry attempted to dislodge him as the New Credit band's doctor on the grounds that he was only one-quarter First Nation, but failed. Jones practiced taxidermy, which was uncommon among First Nations, and was an avid chess player. But he also refused to relinquish his Indian status, a practice that was encouraged by the Indian Department for educated indigenous individuals. Jones died in Hagersville, Ontario in 1909.

Her World War II career was cut short due to the war coming to an end, but, post-war, she was reactivated and served the Navy in a variety of ways until she was decommissioned in 1962.  Construction and career  The second ship to be so named by the Navy, Yazoo (AN-92) was laid down on 6 July 1944, at Duluth, Minnesota, by the Zenith Dredge Co., and was launched on 18 October 1944; sponsored by Mrs. S. H. Griffin, the wife of Colonel S. H. Griffin, USA; and commissioned on 31 May 1945, Lt. Lionel Krisel, USNR, in command.  World War II related service  Yazoo departed Duluth on 15 June, bound for the Atlantic Ocean; travelling via the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway; and arrived at the Boston Navy Yard to commence fitting out. After shakedown training out of Melville, Rhode Island, she underwent post-shakedown alterations at Boston, Massachusetts. She conducted net defense evolutions at Melville before beginning net-laying operations which she carried out in the vicinities of Newport, Rhode Island, New York City, and Boston during the next 18 months.  Post-war service  Yazoo departed Newport on 13 May 1947 and laid fleet moorings at Argentia, Newfoundland, before returning from that cruise on 18 August to resume local operations. She operated out of Newport into 1948. In January of that year, her duties included ice-breaking in the channels of Narragansett Bay after the severe winter weather had frozen the water there.  Operation Martex  That spring, Yazoo pulled a large Navy cargo vessel off the beach at Davisville, Rhode Island between 22 and 25 April 1948 and then made a cruise to Terceira, in the Azores, during September and October of that year, to lay a fleet mooring there. She spent much of the year following her return to the eastern seaboard serving as a target ship for submarines and towing targets for surface battle practices. She conducted similar operations in 1950., with time out in June of that year for laying a light indicator net during Operation Martex. After an overhaul at the Charleston Naval Shipyard (South Carolina) from July to September 1950, Yazoo trained out of Norfolk, Virginia, before she resumed extensive work with nets off Newport. During March 1951, Yazoo took part in U.S. Atlantic Fleet mining exercises out of Key West, Florida, and then spent the remainder of the year performing mine tests and exercises out of Charleston. Between February and April 1952, Yazoo laid nets off Cape Henry during exercises in the Chesapeake Bay. In January 1953, semi-permanent mine tracks were installed on the net- layer, enabling the ship to lay 24 moored-type naval mines. On 9 January, the ship's home port was changed to, to enable her to commence a schedule of tests and exercises under the auspices of the Operational Development Force.  Operation Hardex  She participated in Operation Hardex off the Virginia Capes in June and July of that year before she resumed duty out of Key West later that summer. She performed services for the Mine Evaluation Detachment from April to August of the following year and‚Äîafter salvage operations off Key Largo, Florida‚Äîjoined in Atlantic Fleet exercises that extended along the eastern seaboard of the United States during October 1954.  Operation Canminus  Yazoo continued her routine of local operations out of Key West into 1955. During most of March of that year, the ship took part in one of the largest fleet mine exercises ever held. In one phase of the operation, she planted U.S. Coast Guard buoys marking a channel; and she was one of the final ships to clear the area after the resultant clean-up operation. In April 1955, the ship's home port was again changed‚Äîthis time back to Charleston‚Äîand she took part in a joint United States-Canadian exercise, Operation Canminus in which Yazoo operated as principal minelaying and recovery ship. During the summer of 1955, Yazoo conducted mine exercises out of Key West, Port Everglades, Florida, and Charleston, South Carolina, with the Atlantic Fleet Mine Force. She spent September and November in company with and , carrying out a special project off the coast of Fedhala, French Morocco, the site of the original American landings in North Africa in November 1942. On her return voyage, Yazoo called at Gibraltar, the Azores, and Bermuda, and reached Charleston on 9 December 1955. She entered the naval shipyard there on 6 January 1956 for an overhaul and, later that spring, carried out refresher training out of Norfolk, Virginia, and two weeks of net-tending training at the Harbor Defense Unit, Little Creek, Virginia. Yazoo joined and , on 18 June 1956, in carrying out a special mine project off the coast of Charleston and Cape Romain, South Carolina, that lasted until 23 July. After that task, Yazoo again operated out of Key West, providing services to the Mine Warfare Evaluation Detachment in a Mine Force special project. Later, during Atlantic Fleet mining exercises between 29 October and 24 November, Yazoo laid two large United States Coast Guard buoys; assisted in establishing a exercise channel with Coast Guard lighted buoys and dan buoys; laid surface minefields; delivered triangulation data to the umpiring group during aerial minelaying; and participated in the mine recovery and clean-up phase. She then proceeded to Key West, where she conducted a Mine Force special project in company with and . In the spring of 1957, Yazoo cruised in the Caribbean with the Mine Force and called at San Juan, Puerto Rico; Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, Virgin Islands; and Ciudad Trujillo, Dominican Republic. Upon her return to Charleston, the ship carried out several special mine projects in local areas and spent a fortnight operating with the Mine Warfare Evaluation Detachment at Key West. After an overhaul in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard from July to August 1957, Yazoo conducted refresher training out of Charleston and participated in a service mine test. Exercise Sweep Clear III  The ship spent the first three weeks of 1958 training with the Harbor Defense Unit at Norfolk before she shifted southward to Charleston to participate in Atlantic Fleet amphibious exercises. During July and August of that year, Yazoo participated in Exercise Sweep Clear III, a NATO minesweeping exercise near Sydney, Nova Scotia. During the cruise‚Äîon 26 July 1958‚Äîthe net layer visited Louisburg, Nova Scotia, and recovered a cannon from a French man-of-war that sank on 26 July 1758‚Äîtwo hundred years earlier! Following her return to Charleston on 15 August, Yazoo took part in fleet service mine tests and trained foreign mine warfare officers in the Charleston vicinity. She spent the remainder of 1958 in operations out of Charleston and off the Virginia Capes.  Exercise Clear Sweep IV  Overhauled at the Charleston Naval Shipyard between February and May 1959, Yazoo conducted refresher training and then took part in Exercise Clear Sweep IV off Charleston. Among the ship's duties performed in that vicinity were conducting net training and type training, planting buoys, and laying practice mines for mine warfare schools. During September 1959, Yazoo carried out sweep gear evaluation for the U.S. Bureau of Ships in the Charleston area before she returned to active operations as a minelaying and recovery unit during Fleet exercises off the Virginia Capes and at Onslow Bay, North Carolina. Yazoo again took part in amphibious exercises at Onslow Bay in January 1960, before she carried out service mine tests out of Charleston that lasted into the spring. In July 1960, Yazoo received the battle efficiency competition award for the fiscal year 1960.  Operation Clear Sweep V  That autumn, Yazoo distinguished herself while participating in Operation Clear Sweep V off Nova Scotia. On 12 October, Yazoo received special praise for towing 35 miles to port after that minecraft had suffered a materiel casualty. Three days later, on 15 October, when the Canadian escort maintenance ship suffered a casualty, Yazoo came to the rescue and towed the ship out of dangerous waters, saving her from almost certain grounding in the shoals of Shelburne Harbor. After returning southward, Yazoo underwent a lengthy overhaul at Charleston from November 1960 to February 1961. She operated again with the Mine Force in the Caribbean from February to March 1961, taking part in Fleet amphibious warfare exercises before completing a service mine test off Charleston.  Underwater detonation exercises  That spring, she again participated in exercises off Charleston with Canadian minesweeping and minelaying units and then underwent harbor net training at Norfolk. In July, Yazoo cruised off the coast of Maine, detonating underwater explosions under the auspices of the Office of Naval Research for the Carnegie Institute of Washington, D.C., and received commendations for a job well done from both agencies. Yazoo underwent repairs at Charleston from late July 1961 into September, before she resumed her schedule of mining exercises and net training out of Charleston and Norfolk.  Post-service inactivation  After a year of such duty, she was decommissioned on 28 August 1962. Assigned to the Norfolk group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Yazoo was struck from the Navy List on 1 July 1963 and transferred to the U.S. Maritime Administration (MarAd) for lay up in the James River. She remained in MarAd custody until sometime between 1973 and 1975.

Kwame Kilpatrick Giles came to national attention on August 7, 2008, when he remanded Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick to Wayne County Jail for violating the terms of his bond. The mayor had been charged with perjury, misconduct and obstruction of justice, and took an unauthorized trip to Windsor, Ontario, without the Court's knowledge or permission. Judge Giles' order represented the first time in Detroit history that a sitting mayor had been ordered to jail. In making his ruling, Judge Giles said he was required to make his ruling as though it were \\"John Sixpack\\" sitting in front of him and not the Mayor of Detroit. When Judge Giles was assigned to the Kilpatrick case, prosecutors had moved to disqualify him because he had previously made a $300 contribution to a past Kilpatrick political campaign. No basis was found to disqualify Judge Giles, and he continued to handle the case. In late July 2008, Judge Giles had reduced Kilpatrick's bond from $75,000 to $7,500, but also revoked Kipatrick's privilege to travel without a court hearing. Judge Giles also ordered Kilpatrick to undergo periodic and random drug testing at that time.

The Fixed Period (1882) is a satirical dystopian novel by Anthony Trollope. Introduction It was first published in six instalments in Blackwood's Magazine in 1881‚Äì82 and in book form in 1882. In the same year there also appeared US and Tauchnitz editions of the novel. There were no further editions until 1981.R. H. Super, pp. x‚Äìxi. The Fixed Period is Trollope's only piece of dystopian writing. Trollope was influenced in writing the book by The Old Law, a 17th-century tragicomedy written by Thomas Middleton, William Rowley, and Philip Massinger which he had read, and commented upon, in 1876.R. H. Super, pp. vii‚Äìviii. The Fixed Period is set in the year 1980 in the Republic of Britannula, a fictional island in the vicinity of New Zealand, and deals with euthanasia as a radical solution to the problem of the aged. The novel takes the form of a personal account written by the President of Britannula about the island's recent history. It has frequently been remarked that when the book came out Trollope himself had reached the age of 67, the exact age at which all Britannulans are obliged by law to retire from their worldly affairs and begin a year of preparation for death. Life in Britannula and the concept of the \\"Fixed Period\\" In Trollope's novel, Britannula is a former British Crown Colony which demanded, and was granted, independence from Great Britain in the mid-20th century. Its 250,000 inhabitantsThe Fixed Period, Ch. 5. have, with few exceptions, retained British law and customs, and also her currency. Britannula is a thriving agrarian society whose wealth is mainly based on sheep farming and the wool trade. Its capital, Gladstonopolis, is named after 19th century British Liberal statesman and Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone. After independence and self-government had been gained, the Britannulans set about to organise their political system. According to the Britannulan Constitution, the Assembly, their unicameral parliament, consists of 85 Senators, who are the elected representatives of the people of Britannula. As there are hardly any differences between social classes, and as there is no aristocracy, the institutionalisation of an upper house was not deemed necessary. Also, as opposed to Great Britain, there is no capital punishment.In fact in 1980 there was no death penalty in Great Britain either as it had been abolished in 1969. See Capital punishment in the United Kingdom for details. The Republic of Britannula is headed by an elected President. The first legislative Assembly of about 30 years ago consisted mainly of young, energetic men who were eager to build a modern state. When a proposal was made to terminate citizens' lives at a fixed age to spare them undignified suffering and to help cut down on the state's expenditure on unproductive people, it got an overwhelming majority. The age was fixed at 67, at which time a citizen's \\"deposition\\" was to take place, consisting of their removal to \\"The College\\", an institution situated in the town of Necropolis, followed by their \\"departure\\", and subsequent cremation, exactly one year later, at the age of 68. No \\"departures\\" have been administered so far as none of Britannula's inhabitants has yet reached their \\"Fixed Period\\". The concept of the New Woman has never been known to Britannulans, and there is no feminist movement to speak of. Rather, women still behave and act as if they were living in the Victorian era. They have no role whatsoever in public or business life and lead a quiet and submissive domestic existence. Sex outside marriage is not practised. Plot summary Gabriel Crasweller, a successful merchant-farmer and landowner, is Britannula's oldest citizen. Born in 1913, he emigrated from New Zealand when he was a young man and was instrumental in building the new republic as one of a group of similar-minded men which included his best friend John Neverbend, ten years his junior, who is now serving his term as President of Britannula. Whereas decades ago Crasweller also voted in favour of the law which introduced the \\"Fixed Period\\", he gradually becomes more pensive as the day of his deposition is approaching. Neverbend has long been planning that day and envisaging it as a day of triumph, believing that mankind and civilisation will move an enormous step forward towards perfection. As the originator of the idea, Neverbend also hopes that his name will go down in the annals of history as one of the great reformers. He considers it unfortunate that his friend Crasweller, as the first one to go, does not show any of the signs of old age for which \\"the Law\\" was made in the first place: Crasweller is healthy and vigorous, his mental abilities have not started to deteriorate in any way, and accordingly he is more than capable of managing his own affairs and of earning his living. When all of a sudden Crasweller starts lying about his age and claiming that he was in fact born a year later, Neverbend realises that measures must be taken to ensure the smooth execution of the Law. However, he soon finds out that it has dawned on other elderly citizens as well what the state has in store for them, and that various individuals have come up with all kinds of excuses and plans as to how they are going to oppose their deposition and, eventually, departure. He finds a supporter in Abraham Grundle, one of the young Senators, but is shocked when he realises that Grundle, who is engaged to Crasweller's daughter Eva, only wants to inherit his friend's fortune as soon as possible. But despite this setback, and although both his own son Jack and his wife Sarah turn against him, Neverbend, who has long since passed the point of no return, considers it his duty as President and law-abiding citizen to have Crasweller deposited. As a man of honour, Crasweller finally yields to Neverbend's arguments and stoically accepts his fate. However, on the very day of his deposition the carriage that is to transport the two men to the College is held up in the streets of Gladstonopolis by British armed forces. They have arrived on a warship of enormous dimensions and, by threatening to destroy the whole city with their \\"250-lb swivel gun\\", compel Neverbend to release Crasweller and eventually to step down as President. Britannula is re-annexed by Great Britain, a Governor is installed, and John Neverbend is forced to return to England with them. During the passage Neverbend commits to paper the recent history of Britannula, finishing it only two days before his arrival in England. He plans to write another, more theoretical book on the \\"Fixed Period\\" and to preach to the English about this necessary step in the progress of mankind. However, he realises that he does not really know whether he will be treated with respect in the old country, or whether he will ever be able to return to Britannula. The science fiction element in The Fixed Period Raymond Carr notes that > the publication of the book shocked a public accustomed to find in Trollope > the chronicler of contemporary social life. [...] It is an essay in science > fiction. Technology will produce 250-lb \\"swivel guns\\" that can destroy a > city. Naval officers are equipped with mobile (hair) phones. The inhabitants > ride steam tricycles, cricketers employ \\"a mechanical steam bowler.\\" But he > was no H. G. Wells. The Britannulans still go round in horse-drawn > carriages.Raymond Carr, \\"Back to the Future\\" (1997). In the field of transportation, generally, the absence of any airborne vehicles is quite striking: when the British cricket team travels to Britannula they do so on a steam ship, and it takes them several weeks to reach their destination. In telecommunications, apart from the above-mentioned \\"hair telephone,\\" \\"water telegrams\\" and a \\"reporting-telephone apparatus\\" ‚Äì all of which were only slight refinements of pre-existing Victorian technology ‚Äì seem to be the only important inventions. The latter machine enables newspaper readers in London to read a speech held in Gladstonopolis only one hour after it has been given. William Osler's \\"Fixed Period\\" speech In 1905, after he had been appointed Professor of Medicine at Oxford, Canadian physician William Osler gave a farewell address on leaving Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in which he referred to Trollope's The Fixed Period in a humorous manner. His words were misconstrued, and Osler was quoted as having advocated euthanasia (\\"Osler recommends chloroform at sixty\\").For details, see Charles G. Roland: \\"What Did Trollope Actually Write? The Fixed Period and 'The Fixed Period'\\" (1995). The concept of mandatory euthanasia for humans after a \\"fixed period\\" (often 60 years) became a recurring theme in 20th century imaginative literature ‚Äî for example, Isaac Asimov's 1950 novel Pebble in the Sky.

Former Highbury journalism students include political correspondent John Pienaar and Emmy Award, presenter Simon Reeves and former ITV news reader Mark Austin.  Origins of Highbury College  The history of Highbury College can be traced back to the Borough of Portsmouth and Gosport School of Science and Art, a privately funded organisation that was founded in 1870. The main function of the School was to equip the City‚Äôs future engineers and workers with the skills required in Portsmouth‚Äôs thriving docks and the Royal Navy Dockyard. In 1894 the School‚Äôs science and technology courses were brought under the control of the local authorities as the Borough of Portsmouth Municipal Technical Institute. The Institute had three main departments: Chemistry, Mathematics & Physics, and Civil & Mechanical Engineering. More than 1,300 students attended evening courses with only a small number of students attending during the day. By 1903 subjects taught included hygiene, biology, physiology, woodcarving, navigation, nautical astronomy and dressmaking. In 1908 the Institute was renamed the Portsmouth Municipal College, Within a few years the College was offering external degree courses recognised by the University of London. The Municipal College was designated a regional College by the Department of Education and Science in the 1950s and renamed the Portsmouth College of Technology. As a result of the continued rapid expansion of adult and technical education the Local Education Authority (LEA) decided to establish a branch college at Cosham, which provided convenient access for the people of Portsmouth and beyond. The main purpose of this was to enable the Portsmouth College of Technology to concentrate on courses at graduate and postgraduate level, which it has done ever since ‚Äì initially as Portsmouth Polytechnic and more recently as the University of Portsmouth.  Official Opening of Highbury College  Highbury College was officially opened on 17 September 1963 as Highbury Technical College. Built at a cost of ¬£590,700, the College was originally designed for a student population of 2,800, but 5,000 students enrolled in the first year. Overcrowding quickly became a problem and the College leased huts at Rugby Camp, Hilsea, for use as temporary classrooms. The huts had rudimentary facilities, and are soon referred to as the 'Army Camp' by students and staff alike. A full-time teaching staff of 78, plus part-time staff and visiting lecturers were responsible for delivering Highbury's courses. The College commenced with six Departments: Building & Surveying, Commerce & General Studies, Domestic Studies, Engineering, Mathematics & Science and Hotel & Catering. The College concentrated on vocational and non-degree level courses so that it would not compete with Portsmouth College of Technology, which later became the University of Portsmouth. In its first year the College offered courses at craft and technician, and higher technician levels, leading to full technological certificates awarded through the City & Guilds. In addition, students could study for O Levels and A Levels, as well as Ordinary National Certificates and Diplomas. Higher National Certificates (HNCs) in Building and Civil Engineering were offered part-time. One of the innovative features of the new College was its language laboratory ‚Äì the first of its kind on the South Coast of England, which included soundproof cubicles and audio and visual equipment. The language laboratory was introduced with the Common Market in mind and was popular with local businesses wanting to train their staff as a result of increases in exports. A new block for science teaching was officially opened on 9 February 1966 by Reginald Prentice, then Minister of State for the Department of Education. At the same time student numbers were swelled by the opening of an Apprentice Training Centre.  The Tower  A major extension was completed in 1970, which included a 10-storey Tower. In 1970 responsibility for the Dockyard Technical College was transferred from the Ministry of Defence to the Local Education Authority, resulting in another 700 students for Highbury. A major extension was completed in 1970, which included a 10-storey Tower Alongside the new accommodation, Highbury began the new decade with new modern teaching equipment, which included a radiological laboratory and a new digital computer. Pride of place, however, went to the College‚Äôs new Closed Circuit Television studio (CCTV), which included a broadcast news studio that was able to send programmes to 40 classrooms throughout the College, many of which were made by College staff. By 1971 the College had expanded to ten departments, with 324 full-time teaching staff. Most significantly, Portsmouth Technical College's Hotel & Catering Department was taken over by Highbury when the Technical College assumed polytechnic status. File:Highbury college oldHblock.jpg The Department's rapid growth necessitated the use of annexes around the City until H Block (pictured above), a new facility for Hotel & Catering courses, was opened in 1981. H Block was Britain‚Äôs biggest educational building project at that time and was officially opened on 9 October 1981 by Lord Romsey.  Making links  In 1974 Highbury welcomed its first visitors from Friedrich Albert Lange Vocational College, Duisburg in Germany. The link between the two colleges has remained strong ever since, resulting in a number of beneficial activities including student and staff exchanges. Student numbers rose steadily over the decade and by 1976 student enrolment reached 10,000. In the late 1970s the College was approved by the Council for Academic Awards to offer degree courses jointly with Portsmouth Polytechnic, the first of which was a Degree in Hotel and Catering Studies. In recognition of this the College changed its name to Highbury College of Technology in 1978.  Unicorn Training Centre  In 1982 the former Naval Dockyard Apprentice Training Centre came under civilian management and, as the Unicorn Training Centre, began a transition to a multi- skills training centre for apprentices, school leavers and the unemployed. Highbury took over the new facility in 1983, using it to teach students and apprentices in construction and electrical/electronic trades.  Incorporation  On 1 April 2005 Highbury left local Government control and, under Incorporation, responsibility for the operation of the College now lay with Highbury College Corporation, with members drawn from industry and commerce as well as academic and support staff, the Student Union President and the Principal & chief executive. In 2000 the completion of a ¬£2.2m refurbishment project resulted in new library facilities and the re-cladding of College blocks and the Tower. The Library development included study areas and seminar rooms and was officially opened in 2001 by John Monks, then General Secretary of the TUC. Expansion and renovation In 2002 the College completed a major renovation that included the conversion of the top five floors of the Tower into student accommodation and five floors of refurbished teaching spaces below to include a digital media suite and computer centre. That same year also saw the official opening of Highbury Apex Centre, which now caters for 14- to 16-year-old school pupils, teaching them vocational skills such as bricklaying, plastering and decorating. Plans to expand the College's provision in the City Centre were also implemented with the lease of a building adjacent to an existing College site in Arundel Street. Named Highbury City Centre (later to be Highbury Arundel Centre), the facility now includes Eden, a training salon for Hair & Beauty students.  Highbury Northarbour Centre  Highbury Northarbour Centre opened in 2004. About 2,000 students signed up for courses in the first year, and today Highbury Northarbour Centre trains students in construction and the built environment, with dedicated workshops for each discipline and a specialist construction library.  New beginnings  In 2006 a new three-Colleges-in-one structure was introduced that anticipated national developments in Government priorities. The Collegiate, Corporate and Community Colleges organised the College's provision under three main umbrellas and were introduced so that the College could maintain a clear focus on the needs of its three main client groups: young people aged 14‚Äì19, employers and adult learners in the community. Highbury City of Portsmouth Centre (HCPC) opened in October 2007 following several years of careful planning. A major feature of the Centre was that training could take place in real-life working environments. Facilities at HCPC include industry-standard training kitchens and Chimes Fine Dining, an 80-seat training restaurant that is open to the public. The centre was sold to the University of Portsmouth in August 2018. Running in parallel with the development of HCPC was the redevelopment of Highbury Campus. State-of-the-art teaching and learning environments have replaced old and outdated buildings at the Cosham site, many of which dated back to the opening of the College in 1963.  Marine Training Programmes  Highbury College provides a range of vocational and academic programs in and around Portsmouth including Marine Apprenticeship, Boat Construction Maintenance, and Yacht Maintenance. These courses are delivered at the Solent Marine Academy, located in Boathouse4 within the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard.Maritime Vocational Programmes at Highbury ReferencesExternal links * Highbury College website Category:Further education colleges in Hampshire Category:Further education colleges in the Collab Group Category:Education in Portsmouth Category:Educational institutions established in 1963 Category:1963 establishments in England ","title":"Highbury College"},{"id":"18758178","text":"Javier Frana defeated Emilio S√°nchez 7‚Äì5, 3‚Äì6, 6‚Äì3 to win the 1993 Movistar Open singles competition.

Biography He was born in Cabaniss, Monroe County, Georgia, the cousin of Chuck Willis. He served in the military in the early 1950s, before working as a chauffeur for Chuck Willis during his heyday. He won a talent show at the Magnolia Ballroom in Atlanta and made his first record in 1956, with the Ebb Records' single \\"You're Mine\\". Initially, he only sang, but learned guitar while touring with his cousin; Guitar Slim was one of his foremost influences. After Chuck's death in 1958, Willis played with Elmore James, recording singles through the 1960s for Atco and other labels. His 1972 release, \\"Stoop Down Baby Let Your Daddy See\\", was a jukebox hit but secured no radio airplay, due to its sexually explicit content. The song was one he had developed when working at a carnival show, where he would tease passers-by with ribald rhymes. Some of his later recordings reworked the song. Another of his dirty blues recordings was his cover of \\"Mother Fuyer\\", which appeared on his 1972 album Stoop Down Baby... Let Your Daddy See, and released as the B-side to his \\"Stoop Down Baby Let Your Daddy See\\" single on La Val Records. Willis claimed songwriting credits. He released a steady stream of albums on Ichiban Records in the 1980s and 1990s, and continued to record into the 2000s. He died on December 7, 2013, aged 79.

The congregation dates, informally, to 1872, though it was not formally accepted into the American Episcopal Church until ten years later. The building itself was finished in 1903, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. It is the third church built on the site. Seth Howes, a wealthy congregant, offered to pay for the construction of a stone church to replace the first structure, a wooden church. He hired architects Edward Pearce Casey and Arthur Durant Sneden to design a church that recalled the English country churches that were among the first to use the Gothic Revival architectural style. However, this structure burned down within months of being finished and was immediately replaced. The current building features stained glass by Calvert & Kimberly, former students of Louis Comfort Tiffany. The chancel window, dedicated to Howes, is thought to be the work of Tiffany. The main part of the church has not been altered since its completion, although an addition was built in 1961. Building The church occupies half its corner lot. It takes a cruciform shape, with granite-faced stone walls two feet (50 cm) thick. The tower and nave are supported by buttresses. The former is faced with an E. Howard & Co. clock over the heavy (up to ), detailed red wooden double doors at the entrance; the latter has a cross-gabled roof surfaced in slate. The battlemented belfry shelters a bell. On the south transept is a wooden porch with a second entrance, similar to the first. The north transept leads to the Great Hall wing, built later of sympathetic design and materials. Inside the nave is a hammerbeam roof, its exposed rafters built of varnished pine. On the floor are two rows of oak pews with three aisles. The south transept, once a vestibule itself, is set off with an oak screen and now has a chapel and columbarium. Opposite, to the north, are more pews, one of the organ's pipe banks. In the choir are the organ and its other pipe bank, the altar and two ornamental balconies. The stained glass windows along the walls tell the story of Christ, with the chancel window depicting Christ enthroned. Aesthetics Seth Howes, the church's main benefactor at the time of the building's original construction, was particularly taken with the small country churches he had seen while traveling in England, and sought to have his church in a small country town in upstate New York emulate them. The hammerbeam roof is believed to have been something he asked for; in keeping with the style the two architects relied on simplicity and sweeping lines to create beauty, avoiding later Gothic Revival ornamentation such as gargoyles, flying buttresses or columns. It is, even today, one of the few stone churches in Putnam County. History=19th century In 1872 a group of Brewster townspeople began meeting in what was then the new town hall to hold Sunday school. These continued for eight years until that building burned down in 1880. A Brewster native and founder, Seth Howes, who had returned home to retire after becoming wealthy as a circus entrepreneur and Chicago-area developer, led the congregation in building a small wooden church on the current land. It was opened in 1881; the following year it was formally incorporated and admitted to the Episcopal Diocese of New York, marking the beginning of the church and its parish as a formal entity. 1881 wooden church building In the next decade, the church established two chapels in nearby rural communities (they were eventually reunited with the church when the land on which one stood was acquired by New York City for one of its reservoirs in the area). Howes, who had been building and expanding his Morningthorpe estate south of Brewster, offered to pay for the building of a newer, more stylish church with surplus stone from that construction job. He hired Edward Pearce Casey, best known at the time for his work on the Library of Congress's Thomas Jefferson Building (as it is now known), and Arthur Durant Sneden, then chief designer for the New York City Board of Education. Casey sketched out the main plan of the building and Sneden concentrated on the details. At the insistence of Howes, who had traveled abroad and was fond of English country churches, they hewed to that model. 20th-21st centuries The church was opened in time for Easter services in 1901, just two weeks before Howes died. Two and a half months later, the inside of the new church was gutted by fire and the building was largely destroyed. It was meticulously rebuilt to the original design and was formally consecrated in 1903. Starting in the late 1920s, under the leadership of The Rev. F.A. Coleman, the church expanded its membership and started organizations like a Women's Auxiliary, The Girl's Friendly Society and the St. Andrew's Guild to serve the community. In 1961 the Great Hall, the only addition to the original church since its construction and rebuilding, was built to provide community meeting space and Sunday school programs. The Rev. Lawrence Larson, who took over as rector in the 1980s, further expanded the church's outreach. In addition to the recently started nursery school, he spearheaded the creation of the Brewster Community Food Pantry in cooperation with two other area churches. Both are still in operation. In 2000, the congregation called The Rev. Terri Heyduk to serve as its first permanent female rector, a position she held until 2009. She helped the church buy the neighboring house on Prospect Street, which was used as a consignment shop for some time. The church held its last service around Easter 2019 when falling attendance and increasing costs due to the age of the building meant that it was impractical to continue so the church was forced to close.

HFC departments abroad: Washington, D.C., Beijing, Alexandria, Belgrade, Berlin, Bucharest, Nicosia, London, Odessa, Sofia and Trieste. HFC is the head of the Greek network of the Anna Lindh Foundation for Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and Dialogue between Cultures, and a member of the European Union National Institutes for Culture (EUNIC) in Athens and abroad. The HFC headquarters are located in the former residence of Bodossakis in Palaio Psychiko.  HFC Museums  The Foundation has given considerable weight to the historical and cultural ties existing between the countries under consideration and Greece, such as Odessa and Alexandria. The HFC manages two museums, the only museums maintained by the Hellenic Republic abroad: The Cavafy Museum in Alexandria and the Philike Etairia Museum in Odessa. Both cities with a tradition of close relations with Greece, which made it natural that they should be among the first to be chosen by HFC.  Cavafy Museum  Philike Etairia - dining room The Cavafy Museum was an initiative of Kostis Moskof (1939‚Äì98) in Alexandria at 1992. The museum is one of the houses where C.P. Cavafy lived the last 35 years of his life. The interior of the house has been recreated in detail to resemble the Cavafy‚Äôs days, the exhibits document the poet‚Äôs life and work.  Philike Etairia Museum  The Philike Etairia Museum was established at 1979. In 1994 the museum moved to its historical location, the building where Athanasios Tsakalof, Nikolaos Skoufas and Emmanuel Xanthos founded Philike Etairia (Friendly Society) in 1814. The Friendly Society made preparations for the Greek War of independence of 1821. Prominent Greeks such as Grigorios Maraslis, a great benefactor who was Mayor of Odessa for some years, left their mark permanently on the face of the city. Between 1991 and 1993 the Hellenic Foundation for Culture restored the Odessa museum in cooperation with private individuals, the Odessa Museum of Regional History and museums from Greece.Iris Magazine, Issue 1-2 1993, Hellenic Foundation for Culture, page 33  Initiatives  ŒúŒπŒªŒ¨ŒºŒµ ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨ ‚Äì We Speak Greek HFC offers lessons in Modern Greek at its branches in Alexandria, Belgrade, Bucharest, Odessa, and Trieste.

After his early retirement from the French army in 1901, Lefebvre devoted his time to technological studies, then quite a new field, becoming a main proponent of the negative impact of slavery on technological progress in classical antiquity. Although dissenting voices emerged as early as the 1930s, his primitivist views of ancient traction technology met with considerable success in the 1950s and 1960s when authorities like the medievalist Lynn White and the sinologist Joseph Needham, but also many classicists, relied rather uncritically on his research. He was also a good friend of Jean Francois Champollion Based on a thorough reexamination of the pictorial evidence, much of it not available in Lefebvre's time, as well as experimental archaeology, modern scholars like Georges Raepsaet have refuted Lefebvre's findings, particularly his glaring underestimation of the capacities of ancient horse-drawn ploughs and carriages.Raepsaet, Georges: \\"Landtransport, Part 2: Riding, Harnesses, and Vehicles\\", in Oleson, John Peter (ed.), Handbook of Engineering and Technology in the Classical World, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 580‚Äì605, Roman traction systems: Who was Lefebvre des No√´ttes? His depreciation of the classical quarter-rudder in favour of the medieval stern-mounted rudder has also given way to a more balanced interpretation which argues that the two systems rather differed in the kinds of advantages they offered.Lawrence V.

United Kingdom The first club to install this 'plastic grass' surface was Queens Park Rangers who installed the new pitch for the start of the 1981/82 season. Despite much publicity around the supposed unfair advantage the pitch would provide Rangers, they proceeded to lose the opening home Division Two match on the new surface by 1-2 against Luton Town. The pitch did prove to be successful for Rangers though, as they reached the FA Cup Final in the 1981/82 season (as a 2nd Division club), and then won the (old) 2nd Division Championship the following season. The innovation at Loftus Road brought mixed results, for while the ball ran smoothly enough over the hard surface, it was unpredictable when allowed to bounce. This caused confusion among defenders and goalkeepers in particular. The Omniturf pitch lasted at Rangers' Loftus Road ground for seven seasons; the pitch was torn up at the end of the 1987/88 season. Other Football League clubs which also laid similar artificial surfaces during the 1980s were Luton Town, Oldham Athletic, and Preston North End. United States For American football, Omniturf was installed several college football stadiums in the United States. Its first major venue was Autzen Stadium at the University of Oregon in Eugene in 1984. It had generally favorable results and installed a second field in 1991, which was used until 2000, when the stadium used Nexturf the next year; it switched again to the current FieldTurf in 2002. Martin Stadium at Washington State University in Pullman switched to Omniturf in 1990, and used it for a decade; like Autzen Stadium, it now uses FieldTurf. The University of Missouri in Columbia had Omniturf at Faurot Field from 1985 through 1994, with less favorable reviews. In the early 1990s, the surface was panned by both Tigers and opponents alike as one of the worst in college football. In 1992, the coaches in the Big Eight Conference issued a statement that Faurot Field's surface was \\"a detriment to the home and visiting teams and takes away from the integrity of the game played on such a field.\\" Missouri had a natural grass field prior to 1985, and returned to it in 1995. The stadium has since switched to a FieldTurf surface. Canada The only major installation of OmniTurf in Canada was for the Canadian Football League's Saskatchewan Roughriders's stadium, Taylor Field in Regina. It was installed in 1988 and stayed until the end of the 1999 season.http://www.riderville.com/2002/06/12/history/ References Category:Artificial turf Category:Queens Park Rangers F.C.

By 1984 she had her first job as a winemaker but began thinking differently about winemaking when she made two barrels of wine using wild yeast in 1989. During her career, Turley evangelized a variety of winemaking methods that were unique for their time. She was one of the first winemakers in California to use cold soaks and to focus on harvesting phenolically ripe fruit to as to make the wine as natural as possible. During the 1990s, Turley helped usher in the era of the superconsultant in California, taking startups such as Peter Michael, Colgin and Bryant Family to fame as her winegrowing regime pushed wine quality to new heights.

He was killed following the Saint-Sylvestre coup d'√©tat. Saint-Sylvestre coup d'√©tat Central African Republic President David Dacko, Jean-B√©del Bokassa's cousin, took over the country in 1960,. and Bokassa, a military officer in the French army, joined the CAR army in 1962.. By 1965, the country was in turmoil‚Äîplagued by corruption and slow economic growth, while its borders were breached by rebels from neighboring countries.. Dacko obtained financial aid from the communist People's Republic of China, but despite this support, the country's problems persisted. Bokassa made plans to take over the government; Dacko became aware of this, and countered by forming the gendarmerie headed by Izamo of the Sara ethnic group,. who quickly became Dacko's closest adviser.. Tensions between Dacko and Bokassa increased. In December, Dacko approved a budget increase for Izamo's gendarmerie, but rejected the budget proposal for Bokassa's army.. At this point, Bokassa told friends he was annoyed by Dacko's treatment and was \\"going for a coup d'√©tat\\".. Dacko planned to replace Bokassa with Izamo as his personal military adviser, and wanted to promote army officers loyal to the government, while demoting Bokassa and his close associates. Bokassa realized he had to act against Dacko quickly, and worried that his 500-man army would be no match for the gendarmerie and the presidential guard. He was also concerned the French would intervene to aid Dacko, as had occurred after the 23 February 1964 coup d'√©tat in Gabon against President L√©on M'ba. After receiving word of the coup from the country's military chief of staff, Omar Bongo, officials in Paris sent paratroopers to Gabon in a matter of hours and M'ba was quickly restored to power.. Bokassa found substantive support from his co-conspirator, Captain Alexandre Banza, who was commander of the Camp Kassa√Ø military base in northeast Bangui, and, like Bokassa, had served in the French army in posts around the world. Banza was an intelligent, ambitious and capable man who played a major role in planning the coup. By December, many people began to anticipate the potential turmoil that would result. Dacko's personal advisers alerted him that Bokassa \\"showed signs of mental instability\\" and needed to be arrested before he sought to bring down the government, but Dacko failed to heed these warnings. Execution of the coup Map of the Central African Republic Early in the evening of 31 December 1965, Dacko left the Palais de la Renaissance to visit one of his ministers' plantations southwest of the capital. At 22:30, Captain Banza gave orders to his officers to begin the coup: one of his captains was to subdue the security guard in the presidential palace, while the other was to take control of Radio-Bangui to prevent communication between Dacko and his followers.. Bokassa called Izamo at his headquarters, asking him to come to Camp de Roux to sign some papers that needed his immediate attention. Izamo, who was at a New Year's Eve celebration with friends, reluctantly agreed and traveled in his wife's car to the camp. Upon arrival, he was confronted by Banza and Bokassa, who informed him of the coup in progress. When asked if he would support the coup, Izamo said no, leading Bokassa and Banza to overpower him and hold him in a cellar. At midnight on 1 January 1966, Bokassa and Banza organized their troops and told them of their plan to take over the government. Bokassa claimed that Dacko had resigned from the presidency and given the position to Izamo, then told the soldiers that the gendarmerie would take over the CAR army, which had to act now to keep its position. He then asked the soldiers if they would support his course of action; the men who refused were locked up. At 00:30, Banza, Bokassa and their supporters left Camp de Roux to take over the capital. They encountered little resistance and were able to take Bangui. Bokassa and Banza then rushed to the Palais de la Renaissance, where they tried to arrest Dacko, who was nowhere to be found. Bokassa began to panic, as he believed the president had been warned of the coup in advance, and immediately ordered his soldiers to search for Dacko in the countryside until he was found. Dacko was not aware of the events taking place in the capital. After leaving his minister's plantation near midnight, he headed to Simon Samba's house to ask the Aka Pgymy leader to conduct a year-end ritual. After an hour at Samba's house, he was informed of the coup in Bangui. Dacko was arrested by soldiers patrolling P√©t√©vo Junction, on the western border of the capital. He was taken back to the presidential palace, where Bokassa hugged the president and told him, \\"I tried to warn you‚Äîbut now it's too late\\". President Dacko was taken to Ngaragba Prison in east Bangui at around 02:00. In a move that he thought would boost his popularity in the country, Bokassa ordered prison director Otto Sacher to release all prisoners in the jail. Bokassa then took Dacko to Camp Kassa√Ø at 03:20, where the president was forced by Banza to resign from office. Banza wanted to kill Dacko, but Bokassa would not allow it, believing that Dacko had not yet outlived his usefulness. Later, Bokassa's officers announced on Radio-Bangui that the Dacko government had been toppled and Bokassa had taken over control.. Death Bokassa often claimed that he seized power to prevent Izamo from doing the same.. For this reason, along with director of the Presidential security service Prosper Mounoumbaye, Bokassa considered Izamo a particularly dangerous individual and \\"did not rest until they were eliminated\\".. Attempting to escape,. he was taken out of his cellar, moved to Camp de Roux, and then to Ngaragba Prison at roughly 10 January. At the end of January, Izamo died from mistreatment and neglect.

The brand is headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa. The chain began in 1934 in the United States and was based in Chicago. The brand was introduced to the United Kingdom in 1954 as \\"Wimpy Bar\\". Wimpy grew to approximately 1,500 locations in several countries before narrowing to a few hundred locations in two countries. Wimpy's worldwide headquarters was located in the United States and the United Kingdom before relocating to South Africa. Wimpy's menu consists primarily of grilled dishes, hamburgers, chips (fries), breakfast items and beverages. History A Wimpy restaurant in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire (2010). A Wimpy restaurant in Ryde, Isle of Wight (2011), with the previous logo Origins in the United States The Wimpy brand was established in 1934 by Edward Gold, when he opened his first location in Bloomington, Indiana under the name Wimpy Grills. The name was inspired by the character of J. Wellington Wimpy from the Popeye cartoons created by E. C. Segar. Gold did not open his first Chicago area location until two years later in 1936, after opening units in five other Midwestern cities. Alternate Link via ProQuest. By 1947, the Chicago Tribune reported that the chain had 26 units, and expected to sell eight million hamburgers annually in the Chicago area. According to a 1978 Chicago Tribune article, Gold's company Wimpy Grills Inc. of Chicago, had 25 locations in the United States at its peak, but only seven locations remained at the time of his death in 1977. Alternate Link via ProQuest. The chain vanished within the United States after Gold's death because no one had purchased the rights and trademark to the Wimpy name from Gold's estate. Wimpy's International In 1954, Gold sold a licence to J. Lyons and Co. to use the Wimpy name in the United Kingdom. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Wimpy Grills Inc. of Chicago later formed a joint company with Lyons called Wimpy's International Inc. in 1957. Wimpy's International was based in Chicago and allowed the brand to operate Wimpy Grills in the rest of the world. Alternate Link via ProQuest. The joint company eventually grew to 1,500 locations, with Gold later selling his share to Lyons prior to his death. After obtaining full control of the international licensing outside of the United States, Lyons and its successors handled global franchising through their United Kingdom-based subsidiary Wimpy International Ltd. This arrangement ceased when Wimpy UK became a subsidiary of the South Africa-based Famous Brands in 2007. The South African company started to handle worldwide franchising duties directly from Johannesburg. United Kingdom Lyons obtained a licence to use the Wimpy brand in the United Kingdom from Edward Gold's Chicago based Wimpy Grills Inc. and, in 1954, the first \\"Wimpy Bar\\" was established at the Lyons Corner House in Coventry Street, London. The bar began as a special fast food section within traditional Corner House restaurants, but the success soon led to the establishment of separate Wimpy restaurants serving only hamburger-based meals. In a 1955 newspaper column, Art Buchwald, syndicated writer for the Washington Post, wrote about the recent opening of a \\"Wimpy's Hamburger Parlor\\" on Coventry Street and about the influence of American culture on the British. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Buchwald wrote, \\"Food served at the table within ten minutes of ordering and with atomic age efficiency. No cutlery needed or given. Drinks served in a bottle with a straw. Condiments in pre-packaged single serving packets.\\" In addition to familiar Wimpy burgers and milkshakes, the British franchise had served ham or sardine rolls called torpedoes and a cold frankfurter with pickled cucumber sandwiches called Freddies. During the 1970s Wimpy refused entry to women on their own after midnight. This may be because of an assumption they might be prostitutes. By 1970, the business had expanded to over 1,000 restaurants in 23 countries. In July 1977, the business was acquired by United Biscuits. By the end of the 1980s, Wimpy was beginning to lose ground to McDonald's, which had opened its first restaurant in the country in 1974, and so the new management of Wimpy began to streamline the business, by converting some of the traditional table service restaurants to counter service. When United Biscuits decided to divest its restaurant division in 1989, it sold the business to Grand Metropolitan (now Diageo). At the time of the sale, there were 381 locations in the United Kingdom. Grand Metropolitan had acquired Burger King the previous year, and it began to convert the counter service restaurants to Burger King since it had a greater global brand recognition. In February 1990, the remaining 216 table service restaurants were purchased by a management buyout, backed by 3i. These were locations that were considered less desirable by Grand Metropolitan. At the time of the buyout, there were also 140 franchised locations outside of the United Kingdom. In October 1999, Wimpy rolled out a chain of restaurants known as Dr. Beaks, to take on brands such as KFC. A second management buyout occurred in May 2002, backed by the Bank of Scotland. At the time of the sale in 2002, there were approximately 300 locations in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Although Wimpy outlets have decreased in numbers in the United Kingdom, they are still found in many towns and cities, including Huddersfield, and at seafront/seasonal locations, such as Clacton-on-Sea, Clarence Pier in Southsea, Porthcawl and Brean Leisure Park in Somerset. By the beginning of the 21st century, most Wimpys were found in less desirable low rent locations that primarily cater to pensioners and others on a fixed income rather than the high street locations of former times. Another big change from earlier times was that most locations were now franchises and not company-owned operations. On 27 February 2007, Famous Brands, which owns the Wimpy franchise in South Africa, announced that it had acquired Wimpy UK. Having acquired the brand, Famous Brands has rebranded Wimpy in the United Kingdom, to bring it in line with Wimpy South Africa. The \\"new\\" logo is the one that had been used by Wimpy UK from the 1960s until the 1980s. In November 2009, Famous Brands began to upgrade its 170 locations in the United Kingdom to resemble United States-style diners. As of March 2019, only 67 restaurants remain in the United Kingdom, down from over 500 during its height in the 1970s. South Africa Wimpy International opened its first South African location in Durban in 1967. The South African restaurants were sold to Bakers SA Ltd in the late 1970s, which in 1987 sold the South African chain to Pleasure Foods, then known as Juicy Lucy SA. Famous Brands Limited, then known as the Steers Holdings Limited, acquired Wimpy when it bought Pleasure Foods in 2003. Famous Brands acquired the United Kingdom-based Wimpy in February 2007, thus becoming the parent company for the chain and beginning to collect the franchise fees from the other franchises. By 2011, Famous Brands had 509 Wimpy restaurants in South Africa, making it the largest franchise in the Wimpy franchise system. Kuwait Since 1970, the Americana Group has operated a single Wimpy restaurant within the Arab state of Kuwait. Former locations=EuropeFrance= In May 1961, French businessman Jacques Borel opened his first Wimpy restaurant in Paris after obtaining an exclusive franchise to operate Wimpy restaurants in France. His restaurant was the first hamburger restaurant in France and had predated the opening of the first McDonald's restaurant by a decade. By the end of that year, he was able to open three more locations within Paris. By 1966, he began to expand outside the capital, starting with Lille. Within a short time, Borel had 20 locations; 15 in Paris and five in the rest of the country. Borel's company was so successful that the French newspaper France-Soir called the French franchise \\"public enemy number 1\\" for introducing American hamburger cuisine and fast food to French public at large. Although successful, Borel was forced to close the chain in 1969, owing to a disagreement he had with Lyons, the British parent company. =Ireland= Wimpy has been in Ireland on two occasions, in the 1960s and '70s, and the early 2000s. In the 2000s, petrol station chain operator Petrogas took on the master franchise for Ireland, and had operated a large number of sites until 2010. Most have been replaced by Grill'n'Fill own branded areas, selling virtually identical products, or Burger King, for which Petrogas had obtained the franchise. Petrogas terminated its master franchise agreement with Wimpy International in 2010. =Netherlands= In 1963, the Dutch supermarket chain Albert Heijn obtained a license from Chicago-based Wimpy International to open the first Wimpy restaurant in the Netherlands on Leidsestraat in Amsterdam. A second restaurant opened the following year on Damrak. Although there are no verifiable records showing when the last Wimpy closed in the Netherlands, it appears that Wimpy may have left the Netherlands by 1969 since Albert Heijn ceased to mention Wimpy in their corporate annual reports after 1969. In 1971, Albert Heijn later helped McDonald's to open its first restaurant in Europe by opening a McDonald's franchise in Zaandam. =West Germany= Restaurateur Heinrich Lobenberg opened the first Wimpy restaurant in West Germany under a franchise license from Wimpy International at the Bochum Hauptbahnhof in December 1964, exactly seven years before the first McDonald's in West Germany, with plans to open up to 300 units in West Germany. Lobenberg had cofounded the then five-unit Kochl√∂ffel chain just three years before in Lingen. There are no verifiable records that Lobenberg opened a second Wimpy unit or how long the Bochum restaurant operated before it closed. A food historian writing in 2014 believes that Wimpy's failure to survive in Cold War era West Germany was caused by West German consumers of the 1960s preferring to eat familiar German-style chicken meals at the local Wienerwald chain instead of getting an unfamiliar American-style hamburger sandwich at Wimpy. At that time, Wimpy \\"was regarded with mere curiosity\\". OceaniaAustralia= The Wimpy licence in Australia was held by Happysnaks Pty Ltd and was owned by restaurateur and entrepreneur Oliver Shaul. The first Wimpy bar opened in Sydney in November 1964, owned and operated directly by Happysnaks. Subsequent Wimpy bars operated as franchises. By 1971, there were 70 Wimpy bars around Australia, the most successful being in Hindley Street, Adelaide. Unable to compete with McDonald's, the Wimpy brand was withdrawn in 1975 and most Wimpy bars became independent fast food outlets. =New Zealand= Wimpy had branches in New Zealand, including Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga, Paraparaumu, Wanganui, Palmerston North, New Plymouth and Taupo. These were all rebranded in 2002. One store remained in Rotorua trading as Wimpy, although it was not part of the franchise chain. The last Wimpy in New Zealand was put up for sale in May 2008. AsiaIndia= Wimpy was one of the first fast food restaurant chains to open in India's free market economy. With a run of initial success, Wimpy was often touted as the first icon of 'Westernization' in India. A few of the restaurants which were still in business were located in Punjab until 2002. =Israel= Wimpy entered the Israeli market in the 1960s, and for a time dominated the hamburger restaurant market. Before its final failure and pullout in the 1980s, Wimpy was joined in an emerging market for hamburger restaurants by Burgeranch (since 1972) and MacDavid (since 1978). Wimpy restaurants were infamous in Israel for poor product flavor, sanitation and hygiene; however, the chain did pioneer hamburger restaurants in Israel.

The following orders were made under section 15(2): *The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (Commencement) (No. 2) Order 1997 (SI 1997/1498) (C 58) *The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (Commencement No. 3) Order 1998 (SI 1998/1902) (C 42)  Racially or religiously aggravated harassment  Section 32 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 now provides that where a person commits an offence under section 2 or 4 of the Protection from Harassment Act which is \\"racially or religiously aggravated\\" within the meaning of section 28 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (as amended by the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001) he is guilty of an offence triable either way. A person convicted on indictment of an offence falling within section 32(1)(a) of the 1998 Act (the racially or religiously aggravated version of the offence under section 2 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997) is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to a fine, or to both. A person convicted of indictment of an offence falling within section 32(1)(b) of the 1998 Act (the racially or religiously aggravated version of the offence under section 4 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997) is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years or to a fine, or to both. Definition In England and Wales, the Act now creates offences of harassment,Section 2(1) stalking,Section 2A(1) putting people in fear of violence,Section 4(1) stalking involving fear of violence or serious alarm or distress,Section 4A(1) breach of injunctionSection 3(6) and breach of restraining order.Section 5(5) Someone who believes they are the victim of harassment falling within section 1 of the Act may (either instead of or in addition to a criminal prosecution) elect to pursue a civil remedy for damages for anxiety or for financial loss arising from harassment: section 3(2). Section 3 creates a statutory tort based on the same acts as the criminal offence. An example of this tort in action appears in Green v DB Group Services (UK) Ltd [2006] EWHC 1898 QB (1 August 2006). Green v DB Group Services which was a case of severe and prolonged workplace bullying resulting in serious illness of the claimant. If a claimant elects to pursue the section 3 civil law remedy, the standard of proof which needs to be shown is the common law standard of proof on \\"the balance of probabilities\\" (more likely than not) rather than the standard for criminal law which is proof beyond reasonable doubt. The editor of \\"Archbold\\" notes the Act does not attempt to define \\"harassment\\".Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice 2009. Para 19-277A at p 1986 In Thomas v News Group Newspapers and Another (2001), Lord Philips MR said: \\"'Harassment' is, however, a word which has a meaning which is generally understood. It describes conduct targeted at an individual which is calculated to produce the consequences described in section 7 and which is oppressive and unreasonable.\\"Thomas v News Group Newspapers and Another [2001] EWCA Civ 1233 Section 7(2) of the Act provides that, for the purpose of the interpretation of sections 1 to 5A, references to harassing a person include alarming the person or causing the person distress.Herring, Jonathan. Criminal Law: Text, Cases, and Materials. OUP. 2004. p 342. Section 5 of the Act gives the court in criminal cases a power to grant restraining orders and section 5A, introduced by the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, extends this power to cases where the defendant was acquitted, if the court \\"considers it necessary to do so to protect a person from harassment by the defendant.\\".section 5A The power to grant restraining orders was characterised as \\"the most important aspect of the Act\\" by practitioners interviewed in a Home Office research study (2000) into the effectiveness of the Act.p.56 Home Office Research Study 203 The power to grant restraining orders is separate from and additional to the ability of claimants to seek injunctions in civil actions brought under section 3 of the Act. However, in each case the penalties for breach of a restraining order or an injunction are similar: on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or a fine, or both, or on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or both.sections 3(9) and 5(6)of the Act.

Criminal Law Theory and Doctrine. Second Edition. p 398 Course of conduct Section 7(3) of the Act provides that a course of conduct must involve conduct on at least two occasions. (Originally these occasions needed to involve the same person, but the Act was amended by the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 so that \\"pursuing a course of conduct\\" could mean approaching two people just once.) In Wainwright v. Home Office (2003), Lord Hoffmann said \\"The requirement of a course of conduct shows that Parliament was conscious that it might not be in the public interest to allow the law to be set in motion for one boorish incident.\\"[2003] UKHL 53 at paragraph 46 per Lord Hoffmann The Act contains no definition of \\"course of conduct\\" beyond the provisions of sections 7(3) and (4).Ormerod, D C. \\"Commentary\\" to Lau v DPP [2000] Crim LR 580 at 581 Case law has established that \\"merely because there are two incidents between the same parties, this will not inevitably give rise to a course of conduct\\" and \\"the requirement of a nexus between the incidents appears an eminently sensible way in which to limit the potentially immense reach of the offence of harassment.\\"Finch, Emily. \\"Commentary\\" to Pratt v Director of Public Prosecutions, The Times (22 August 2001) Journal of Criminal Law, JCL 66(4) In 2003, David Ormerod said that the \\"course of conduct\\" element defies definition.

(Used as \\"the basis for liability\\" for offences under sections 2 and 4). or actual knowledge is an element of the offences under sections 2, 2A, 4 and 4A; that is, the prosecution has to show that the defendant \\"knows or ought to know\\" that the course of conduct complained of has the prescribed effects on the person at whom it is directed. The test of \\"ought to know\\" is based on what \\"a reasonable person in possession of the same information\\" would think about the course of conduct in question.Sections 1(2), 4(2), 4A(2) and 4A(3) Section 4(2) \\"has an unusual type of mens rea with objective and subjective components.\\"Ormerod, D C. \\"Commentary\\" to R v Henley [2000] Crim LR 582 at 584 The justification for the imposition of liability based on constructive knowledge is the difficulty which might exist of proving mens rea on the part of \\"stalkers\\" who often suffer from mental or personality disorders.Allen, Michael J. Textbook on Criminal Law. 10th Edition. Oxford University Press. 2009. . Page 104. Threshold There are a multitude of thresholds within the act and law, the protection from harassment act does NOT comply with the rule of law as there is uncertainty, due to the issues of criminal and civil liability, the reasonable person, the day to day dealings with others, and where there is Section 1 (3) of the act, setting out reasonable (S1 (3) (c)) to comply with a rule of law or order under any enactment (S1 (3) (b) and for the detection and prevention of crime S1 (3) (a). in Majrowski v Guy‚Äôs and St. Thomas‚Äôs NHS Trust [2007] 1 AC 224 was a mention of the Threshold for harassment to \\"sustain a criminal liability\\" Para 30: \\"In most cases courts should have little difficulty in applying the 'close connection' test. Where the claim meets that requirement, and the quality of the conduct said to constitute harassment is being examined, courts will have in mind that irritations, annoyances, even a measure of upset, arise at times in everybody's day-to-day dealings with other people. Courts are well able to recognise the boundary between conduct which is unattractive, even unreasonable, and conduct which is oppressive and unacceptable. To cross the boundary from the regrettable to the unacceptable the gravity of the misconduct must be of an order which would sustain criminal liability under section 2.\\" unfortunately this boundary is a discretion of the court and judges and is NOT applied in most courts across the UK. The issue with conduct which will cause alarm and distress as a civil liability or for a \\"cause to action\\" is a \\"subjective\\" and often \\"tainted\\" view which has elements of heuristic bias as will the \\"defendant\\" to a claim of harassment. Criminal charges undertaken where a person is using S1 (3) has a difficult task in what appears to be at every stage of the proceeding's ( including pre actions Protocols) in UKSC 17 (2013) Lord Reed Said at para 29: \\"That Parliament should have intended section 1(3)(a) to apply, regardless of whether the pursuit of the course of conduct was objectively reasonable or not, may at first sight seem surprising, given that the conduct must otherwise constitute harassment before section 1(3)(a) can come into play.\\" Therefore the issue arises where a defendant must be found criminally guilty before they can make a defence, however the main defect in the court is that they only seek to find harassment, but stop at any defence or \\"avowed\\" purpose and the Supreme court commented on the difficulty in the matter of the two tests applied which are subjective and objective. UKSC17 (2013) at P12: \\"The difficulty about a wholly objective test is that it is not consistent with either the language or the purpose of the Act. The only wholly objective test which could work in this context is one based on the reasonableness of the alleged harasser in supposing that there was a crime to be prevented or detected or that his conduct was calculated to achieve those ends.\\" \\"A wholly subjective test, on the other hand, such as the one that the judge applied to Mr Willoughby, is equally problematic. Before the defence can arise, it must be shown that the victim has been harassed\\" \\"I do not doubt that in the context of section 1(3)(a) purpose is a subjective state of mind. But in my opinion, the necessary control mechanism is to be found in the concept of rationality, which Eady J touched on in Howlett v Holding [2006] EWHC 41 (QB) and Moses LJ seems to have been reaching for in his judgment in the present case. Rationality is a familiar concept in public law.\\" Alarm and distress was set out in the Data protection act 1998 S10, however was modified in 2017 to \\"significant Alarm and distress\\" a short coming within the enactment of harassment which has been largely undefined and illegal since its first concepts. Employers' liability Employers have vicarious liability for harassment by their employees under section 3 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (see Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust[2006] UKHL 34, [2006] ICR 1199). For employees this may provide an easier route to compensation than claims based on discrimination legislation or personal injury claims for stress at work, as the elements of harassment are likely to be easier to prove, the statutory defence is not available to the employer, and it may be easier to establish a claim for compensation. Also as the claim can be made in either the High Court or the County Court costs may be recoverable by the successful party, subject to relevant court rules and limits. Number of prosecutions The Bill for this Act said that it was expected to result in about two hundred prosecutions a year.Explanatory Memorandum to the Protection from Harassment Bill. In 1998, there were nearly six thousand prosecutions.Ormerod, D C. \\"Commentary\\" to R v Colohan [2001] Crim LR 845 at 846 A written question, raised by a Member of Parliament in 2008 and relating to prosecutions under section 2 from the date of the Act to 2006,Hansard:HC Deb 30 Jun 2008 : Column 687W showed the numbers of persons proceeded against under section 2 remained fairly steady during the period (5,540 in 1999 of whom 2,753 were found guilty, 5,446 in 2006 of whom 3,768 were found guilty). A 2011 written questionHansard:HC Deb 21 Nov 2011: Column 167W requesting information about prosecutions under section 2 during the period 2006-2009 showed 5,006 persons proceeded against during 2006-7 of whom 3,543 were found guilty, 4,940 proceeded against during 2007-8 of whom 3,650 were found guilty and 4,865 proceeded against during 2008-9 of whom 3,892 were found guilty. Northern Ireland The Protection from Harassment (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 (SI 1997/1180) (NI 9) was made under paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Northern Ireland Act 1974 (as modified by section 13 of this Act) only for purposes corresponding to those of sections 1 to 7 and 12 of this Act. Scotland In Scotland the Act works differently. Civil remedies include damages, interdict and non-harassment ordersThe Protection from Harassment Act 1997, section 8(5) backed by powers of arrest. Any person who is in breach of a non-harassment order made under section 8 is guilty of an offence and liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or to a fine, or to both, and, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or to both.The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, section 9(1), as repealed in part by section 49(2)(a) of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 A breach of a non-harassment order is not otherwise punishable.The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, section 9 Some Scots lawyers are of the view that there was no need for this Act to extend to Scotland because the law of Scotland already dealt satisfactorily with harassment and contained no relevant lacuna corresponding to any which existed in English law.Lawson-Cruttenden, Timothy; Addison, Neil. Blackstone's Guide to the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. Blackstone Press Limited. 1997. Page 2. History The Act resulted from the efforts of Evonne Leonora Von Heussen. A stalking victim herself, she launched the National Association for Victims of Stalking and Harassment (NASH) in 1993, when her then teen-age daughter was stalked by a dangerous character who was known to carry a knife. After Von Heussen found that she could get no help from the police, lawyers, or her local Member of Parliament she began researching anti-stalking laws in other countries. She opened a help line on which she eventually took tens of thousands of calls. She pursued each call with each victim's MP, and attracted a large amount of media attention. After several years of effort she persuaded the Home Office under Prime Minister John Major to take the issue on as a matter of government policy. She wrote the first draft of the Act and worked closely with ministers and senior civil servants in the Home Office and the Lord Chancellor's Department as the final version took shape. She advised ministers from her seat in the Under Gallery, on the floor of the House of Commons, during the Second Reading Debate. After Royal Assent she worked with Home Office and Lord Chancellor's Department in training judges, lawyers, other court personnel, police and voluntary organizations in the use of the Act. She received the MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours List (1997) for her efforts. She also worked as a consultant on a number of court cases involving stalking and harassment. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 was preceded by the Stalking Bill.John Marston and Katherine Thompson (1997) 161 Justice of the Peace and Local Government Law 739 (2 August) Google BooksLeonard Jason- Lloyd (1997) 161 Justice of the Peace and Local Government Law 787 (16 August) Criticism The passing of this Act was \\"hasty\\".Simester, A P; Sullivan, G R; Criminal Law Theory and Doctrine.

In \\"Law\\". Page 2. Insert in \\"The Times\\". 7 November 2006. Infield and Platford said that they did not agree with claims that this Act is a breach of human rights.  \\"Prevention of harassment\\" notices  Following the passage of the Act, police forces started to issue \\"prevention of harassment\\" notices, also known as \\"Police Information Notices\\" (PINs), to people against whom claims of harassment had been made. They are believed to have been created by police forces as a way of preventing people accused of harassment from claiming ignorance that their alleged behavior was undesired and thus avoiding successful prosecution under the Act due to lack of mens rea. Their use has been the subject of controversy, with some describing the notices as \\"unnecessarily menacing and accusatorial\\". In November 2011, whilst Theresa May was Home Secretary, the Home Office published a consultation on stalking which said: \\"We recognise that there are concerns around the process by which these notices are issued. Some argue that those issued with a Police Information Notice are not given a fair hearing. Equally we are aware that some consider Police Information Notices to lack teeth and that they give victims a false sense of security.\\" In 2014, the Commons Select Committee of Privileges investigated the issuing in 2012 of a PIN against an MP for statements made in Parliament. Their findings led the police to withdraw the notice. In 2015, the issuing of a PIN against a British journalist raised concerns about civil liberties and press freedom, creating demands for reform of the process. Because a PIN has no statutory basis and therefore no legal effect, there is no right of appeal against it, although a complaint can be made to the issuing police force.

Early life and education Born in Maguiresbridge, County Fermanagh Ken Fleming was the son of a Church of Ireland minister. In July 1945, he won the Seale Scholarship to Portora Royal School. He graduated from Queen's University Belfast (1955) and became an assistant lecturer, later being awarded a PHD in 1958. Working Life In 1958 Ken Fleming joined J. Laing and Sons (in Mill Hill, London, NW7). When Laing‚Äôs joined up to form McKinney Foundations, Fleming was involved as a technical advisor for the piling foundations for London's Centre Point. He also travelled to America where he spent time with company founder Jack McKinney who encouraged his interest in developing improved piling techniques. McKinney Foundations was bought by Cementation Foundations in 1968 and Ken Fleming became chief engineer. At Cementation, Fleming was involved in the development of a series of new systems for improving the receptiveness of the ground to secure piles and to provide reliable information on the settlement of piles. Ken Fleming created the \\"Cemset\\" system which forecasts pile settlement under load. He became chairman of the Federation of Piling Contractors, and in 1975 chairman and founder member of the Federation of Piling Specialists. In 1985 he was the lead author of Piling Engineering,Piling Engineering By Ken Fleming, Austin Weltman, Keith Elson, Mark Randolph at Google Books which has become an industry standard reference book. The third edition of Piling Engineering, still containing much of Fleming's original material, published in September 2008. Fleming influenced European piling through the European Federation of Foundation Contractors. He disagreed with parts of the Eurocode EC7. Among other objections he believed it had fundamental technical flaws in relation to pile testing. The British Standards Institution awarded Fleming it‚Äôs Distinguished Service award in 1992. In 1999 the British Geotechnical Society honoured him with the prestigious Skempton Medal for his lifelong contribution to geotechnical engineering. In 2000 the British Geotechnical Association joined with Cementation (now part of Skanska) to mark Fleming's contribution to geotechnical engineering by inaugurating the Fleming Award. This international award is presented annually for excellence in geotechnical design and construction. A visiting Professor at Queen's University Belfast, Fleming was also a prominent figure in the Institution of Civil Engineers.

It stars Kiron Kher, Tanushree Dutta, Ankur Khanna, Farooq Shaikh, Masumeh Makhija, Lillete Dubey, and Sharon Prabhakar. The film focuses on the complexities of discovering love in the world of the new Mumbai. The movie is set against the backdrop of the stress of working in financial markets, embarrassing kitty parties, outrageous soap operas, and the ongoing angst and excitement of an ever-emerging India. It is considered part of the Masala film genre, which depicts a mixture of action, comedy, romance, and drama/melodrama. Synopsis When her mother suddenly divorces her father and leaves their comfortable home in Kolkata, Nitya finds herself in the new setting of Navi Mumbai. Her life is turned upside down. She must navigate life in a new city, start a new job at a call centre, and let go of her ambition to go to the United States to get an MBA. She soon meets and befriends the extremely nice Ritesh Jetmalani, who helps her cope with all this change. Kirti Wagaskar, Ritesh's girlfriend, has plans to marry rich. She spends an entire month‚Äôs salary on a Gucci bag and dreams of marrying Yash Modi, a billionaire by birth. She resents her elder sister Parimal's life as a housewife with her grouchy traditional husband, Ganpatrao. Nitya‚Äôs mother Binita Sen is troubled by her failed marriage. She hopes to find the new start she needs in New Mumbai. She is befriended by the women in the colony and joins their kitty party. She knows her daughter is angry with her and blames her for their situation, but believes that this was their best alternative. Binita‚Äôs father had left her some shares. At her father‚Äôs old stock brokerage house she meets Firoz Sethna, an ethical, but cranky and eccentric, stock broker who teaches her the ropes of investing.

History The Il Fornaio brand was established in 1972 as a baking school in Barlassina, Lombardia, Italy. It opened a retail bakery in Milan in 1975, and was licensed in 1981 to Williams-Sonoma, Inc. as a retail bakery concept. Williams-Sonoma opened four locations in California before selling the business to private investors in 1983. Initially unsuccessful, the chain was re-sold in 1986 to Larry Mindel, who had run local restaurant holding company Spectrum Foods and launched or bought a series of successful restaurants: Chianti in Los Angeles; Prego (one of the originators of California-style pizza), MacArthur Park and Ciao in San Francisco and Guaymas in Tiburon. The new owners opened a total of 11 restaurant-bakeries in California in late 1980s and 1990s. The first restaurant location and headquarters are in Corte Madera, California, the second in San Francisco. They then branched out to Las Vegas, Nevada, Colorado, Seattle, and Virginia, opening a total of 22 by 2008. In 1997 the company became publicly traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange. By 2000 the company had $124 million annual revenues. The company was eventually taken private again in a leveraged buyout. Mindel sold most of his equity and retired from daily operations of the group in 2001 (his son, Michael, continued and is Senior Vice President of Marketing as of 2014), and in 2003 opened Poggio at the Casa Madrona Hotel in Sausalito as a personal project. Under the direction of Executive Chef Maurizio Mazzon, a native of Venice, the company launched a second concept, Canaletto Ristorante Veneto, at the Venetian in Las Vegas in 1999, with a second location in 2008 in Fashion Island shopping mall in Newport Beach, California. Roark Capital Group bought the company in 2011. Description Il Fornaio in left Each restaurant shares a core lunch and dinner menu created collectively by the company's chefs, plus signature dishes and specials at the discretion of each individual chef. Fresh pasta is made in-house daily and all sauces, soups and dressings are made from scratch. Many locations featured wood-fired rotisseries and grills. The restaurants also offer gluten-free menus and an array of vegetarian and vegan offerings. Housemade desserts complete many meals Overall, the company caters mostly to repeat guests at its 21 locations. Regular customers averaged 12.7 return visits per year (later reported to be 17), considered very high in the industry. The company is known for its long-running \\"Festa Regionale\\" loyalty program promotion Two weeks out of every month the restaurants promote dishes from a rotating schedule of Italy's 20 food regions with a special insert. The 10,000 promotion members receive a \\"passport stamp\\" from that region if they order one of the items, and those who collect each stamp receive a gift. As an unintended benefit, the promotion became a vehicle for recruiting cooks and chefs, after tourism offices in Italy noticed the promotion and established relationships with the company.

The Guru Vandana program provides a platform for students to honor their teachers for imparting knowledge and wisdom to them. Guru The concept of Guru is as old as humanity itself. Primarily, the word Guru means a 'teacher' and as such it is a universal concept based on the idea of transmitting knowledge from a person, who knows something, to an ignorant student or disciple. In an extended view, a Guru can also be a priest, a rabbi, a master, a school teacher, even a father or a mother. Guru does not mean a teacher imparting formal training but a person who contributes to the overall development and learning of an individual. The syllable gu means darkness, the syllable ru, he who dispels them, because of the power to dispel darkness, the guru is thus named. Guru transforms his disciple through his presence and spiritual knowledge. According to RamaKrishna Prarahamsa Spiritual knowledge can not be attained completely by reading books. But for obtaining complete spiritual enlightenment Guru‚Äôs presence is a must. Only when there is a strong bond between Guru and Shishya can spiritual enlightenment occur. Origins of Guru Shishya Parampara Thus our great sanathana dharma tradition has been enriched by the Guru-Sishya relationship. Lord Rama's greatness lay in His relationship with His most loyal disciple Hanuman who taught the essence of Ramanamamritim. Lord Krishna gave us the Bhagavad Gita, thanks to his devoted and most trusted disciple Arjuna. Saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa gave to the world Swami Vivekananda who in turn gave to the world the Ramakrishna Mission, embodying the soul of India. Saint Thyagaraja, an avatar of Sage Valmiki, composed hundreds of soulful Krithis in praise of God. Two Krithis, in particular, refer to the gurus' role in guiding the seeker on the right path. Guru leka in 'Gowrimanohari' raga is a Krithi in which the Saint of Thiruvaiyar sings how one who is trapped in the jungle of desire, can come out of it with help of the right Guru. Saint Thyagaraja says however learned and good a person might be, life would be meaningless without the guidance of a Satguru. In another Krithi, Sri Naradamuni Gururaya ganti in Bhairavi raga, Thyagaraja explains how Satguru Smaranam helps to free one of ignorance. In modern times American Hindu Education Foundation (HEF) had conducted the program in Houston in which over 30 teachers and a principal were honored by students. Children from Houston Balagokulams area picked up their favorite teachers. Acharya Premchand Sridhar of Arya Samaj Houston presided over the program. The program started with Sridhar lighting the lamp and it was followed by cultural programs and with the explanation of Hindu Concept of Gurus. After the felicitation of teachers Veda Vrinda group chanted the section of the Taittariya Upanishad known as the Vedic Commencement Address. Guruvandana is also performed by disciples to spiritual masters. During GuruVandana program GuruGita is recited by disciple to honor his guru. GuruGita forms section of Skanda Purana. In Bangalore Guruvandana was offered to Sankaracharya of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam, Sri Jayendra Saraswathi. Despite rains, a crowd gathered in Malleshwaram to felicitate their Spiritual Guru. In ISKCON temples Guruvandana is performed for spiritual Guru Srila Prabhupada throughout the year. In other religions Apart from Hinduism Guru-Shishya concept is followed in other religions like Jain, Sikh, Buddhism. In fact the word Sikh has origins from Sanskrit 'shishya'. Jains celebrate Guru Vandana as part of their rituals.

Lim was awarded the Order of Nila Utama (First Class) in 2006, the Meritorious Service Medal in 1991 and the Public Administration Medal (Gold) in 1982. Lim was ranked No. 11 on the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute's Public Investor 100.http://www.swfinstitute.org/public-investor-100/lim-siong-guan/ Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute In 2014, a book Lim co-authored, Leader, The Teacher & You (World Scientific, 2013), co-won the Singapore Literature Prize for English Non-fiction. In 2016, Lim and his daughter, Joanne H Lim, released another book, Winning With Honour in Relationships, Family, Organisations, Leadership, And Life (World Scientific). Honour (Singapore)  In August 2014, Lim unveiled \\"Honour Singapore\\", a non-profit organisation advocating a culture of honour, as founding chairman. It attracted scrutiny on social media when it was revealed that all the original members of the board are also senior members of the Full Gospel Business (FGB) Singapore, a group that believes in bringing the Christian teachings to the \\"marketplace\\" and all levels of society. Lim denied categorically that Honour Singapore had Christian inclination, and that Honour Singapore and FGB Singapore share the same office for convenience. The organisation has since added Ambassador Mohammad Alami Musa, non-executive President of the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore, to its board in 2016.

Jo√£o da Silva Feij√≥ studied philosophy and mathematics at the University of Coimbra and adopted the name Feij√≥ in homage to Benito Jer√≥nimo Feijoo, Spanish philosopher, who at the time was respected among natural history students. In 1778, the Italian professor, Domenico Agostino Vandelli, was part of a group that founded the Natural History Museum in Lisbon. Jo√£o da Silva was part of this group with Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira, Manuel da Silva Galv√£o and Joaquim Jos√© da Silva. The feijoa, a tree that bears green fruits similar to guavas, is named after him. Cape Verde Beginning in 1783, scientific voyages under Vandelli were launched. Naturalists were to plan expeditions to various colonies. Feij√≥ arranged to explore the islands of the archipelago of Cape Verde, and arrived there in June 1783. Like his colleagues, he had great difficulty in pursuing his research as an independent man of science. The activities of a young naturalist, who observes and collects objects such as butterflies, plants, shells and minerals, are often regarded with contempt by colonial officials. He described his exploration of Cape Verde in seven letters sent to the minister Martinho de Mello e Castro and discusses the geography, topography and flora of the island. The work of Feij√≥ disappointed his sponsor Mello e Castro, who criticized the packaging of shipments and paucity of material sent. It was regretted that Feij√≥ has not proposed any method of exploiting the saltpetre and sulphur which was believed to be readily available in the volcanic regions of Cape Verde. In 1790, Feij√≥ joined the local military establishment and soon requested that he be allowed to return to Portugal. In Lisbon, Feij√≥ collaborated with his old friend Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira, newly returned from the Amazon, to produce herbarium specimens from the Cape Verde material. The German naturalist Heinrich Friedrich Link, visiting Portugal between 1797 and 1799, met his Brazilian colleagues and praised their work. In 1797, Feij√≥ rewrote some of the text relating to Cape Verde and published a work titled \\"Itin√©raire philosophique\\". External links *Maria Estela Guedes et Lu√≠s M.

During his rule he built upon the expansive foreign policy of his father, Spartokos I. He conquered Nymphaion, became involved in the political developments of the neighbouring Sindike kingdom and laid siege to the city of Theodosia, which was a serious commercial rival because of its ice-free port and proximity to the grain fields of eastern Crimea. He presided over a strengthening of ties with Athens, and at one point possibly had a statue raised in his honour in the city. He was also the father of Leukon and Gorgippos who would expand their realm into a powerful kingdom. Reign Satyros I was a leading figure in the expansion of his father's kingdom, initially gaining some success by taking Nymphaeum from Gylon and perhaps Kimmerikon, but later had extensive problems with the neighbouring Sindike Kingdom, with which he had started an unsuccessful war, and the Greek city-states of Theodosia and Heraclea Pontica. He allowed the son of his powerful minister Sopaios to travel to Athens with two ships filled with wheat. Sopaios's son's ships managed to avoid pirates and arrived at Athens. Once in Athens, his son met with the Athenian banker, Pasion, and managed to settle his affairs. Satyros, however, came to the view that Sopaios was involved in a conspiracy to take his life. So the king had Sopaios arrested. As Sopaios's son was still in Athens, Satyros ordered the Bosporans in Athens to confiscate Sopaios's son's property and force him to return to the Bosporan Kingdom. Afterwards Satyros acquitted Sopaios of his crimes and agreed to Sopaios's daughter, Theodosia, marrying his son Leukon. Problems with the Sindi Satyros encountered extensive problems with the Sindi. According to Polyaenus, the problems arose because Satyros I had offered his daughter to Hekaktaios, the king of the Sindi, but had instructed Hekaktaios to kill his existing wife, Tirgatao. Hekaktaios, instead of killing his wife, had her imprisoned in a tower, from which she was able to escape and reach her tribe, the Ixomatae. Tirgatao married her father's successor, her father presumably being king of the Ixomatae, and roused many tribes to make war against Satyros. Satyros, realising that he could not win, offered his son Metrodoros as a hostage and sued for peace. Shortly after this, there was an attempt on Tirgatao's life, likely organized by Satyros. After finding out about this scheme, Tirgatao had Metrodoros killed, and once again waged war on Satyros. This war would be ended by Leukon and Gorgippos shortly after their father's death and their ascent to the throne. Death and legacy Satyros would later die in the unsuccessful Siege of Theodosia in 389 BC at the age of 81, his death leading to the ascension to Leukon and Gorgippos who would expand the Bosporan Kingdom and establish a dynasty that would rule the Bosporus for another 300 years.

The strip's artist is Laura Howell, who also pens and has subsequently taken over outright Hunt Emerson's \\"Ratz\\", and has also drawn one Minnie the Minx and one Les Pretend strip. The strip starred the title character, and his attempts to terrorise the citizens of his village, Happy Bunny Green, in a less extroverted, but more cunning way than that of Dennis the Menace. The citizens include Mr. Garden, his neighbour, Mrs. Garden, his wife, Mr. Baker the butcher and Mr. Butcher the baker, who are sworn enemies. He has a penchant for amazing ruthlessness. In one strip, he shows a cow a picture of a beefburger during a Cowpat Lottery (in which a cow has to defecate on a villager's selected square). In the Beano Annual 2009, he hijacks an anthropomorphic train named Timmy, injures the driver, drives it dangerously, and eventually destroys it (a parody of Thomas the Tank Engine). The early stories featured a narrator, who spoke in a heavily sugar-coated way, but he disappeared during 2008. His strip continued to appear regularly in the Beano until autumn 2009, when Laura Howell started drawing Beano Manga. As she was already drawing Ratz for the comic, Johnny's appearances became increasingly infrequent.

Biography Makarov was born on 22 May 1914 in the village of Sasovo to the family of a railway worker. In 1936, he enrolled to the Tula Mechanical Institute. At the onset of the German invasion, he was preparing for his graduation. He was hastily qualified as an engineer and sent to the Zagorski Machine Works (now in Sergiyev Posad). The plant was soon evacuated to Kirov Oblast. In 1944, Makarov returned to Tula, and graduated from the Tula Mechanical Institute with honors. In 1945, he took part in a pistol design competition that aimed to find a replacement for the TT pistol and M1895 Nagant revolver (the former was in use since 1930 and the latter since the late 1800s). Makarov's work, which made use of some elements of the Walther PP, won the competition and was adopted by the army in 1951. Makarov continued designing firearms in Tula until his retirement in 1974. Later, he was elected to the Soviet of Working People's Deputies in Tula Oblast, and was chosen as a council member of the scientific and technological society Mashprom.

They Die and They Diet (review of Generation Dead and Zombie Blondes by Brian James), The New York Times The book is a modern reworking of the zombie genre of fiction. It follows a girl named Phoebe and her best friends, Margi and Adam, whose world has been left baffled by a strange phenomenon ‚Äì dead teenagers not staying dead. For reasons unknown, a small number of the teenaged dead are returning to 'life'. They lack a heartbeat and all other traditional life-signs (respiration, digestion, etc.) but are capable of thought, movement and speech (to varying extents). They are widely feared by the living, but Phoebe finds herself attracted to Tommy Williams, one of the \\"living impaired\\" teens at her school. Plot summary The protagonist of the story is goth teenager Phoebe Kendall who, along with her best friends Margi and Adam, attends the fictional Oakvale High School. The world in which the story takes place is a strange one, with a supernatural phenomenon that causes dead teenagers to wake from their graves and move about like regular people‚Äîexcept they don't breathe. With help from the school's principal, Tommy joins Oakvale High's football team. The coach is openly hostile towards him and instructs the other players (in particular Pete, his lackeys Stavis and Harris, and Adam) to do their utmost to injure him so severely that he can no longer play. Adam refuses, and Pete and the others fail. Adam and another living boy, Thornton Harrowood, come to accept Tommy, but when the team plays their first match, they are harassed by anti-zombie protestors. Tommy bargains with the coach, promising to quit as long as he can play, however briefly, in the second half of the game. The school is also visited by the Hunter Foundation, which aims to promote tolerance and understanding of the living impaired. Founders Alish and Angela Hunter announce a work and study program open to all students, intended to improve relations between traditionally and differently biotic people. Phoebe, Margi, Adam and Thornton are the only living students to sign up for the class (affectionately referred to as 'Undead Studies'), along with their differently biotic classmates Tommy, Karen, Evan, Colette, Kevin, Sylvia and Tayshawn. When the class list is posted publicly in the school, Pete steals it, planning to go after each of the class members in turn. It is revealed that Pete's first love, a girl called Julie, died suddenly of an asthma attack some time ago and did not 'come back'. As a result of this, he harbours a deep bitterness and hatred for all differently biotic people, believing them to be unworthy of the second chance that Julie was denied. His mental stability is uncertain, since he sees hallucinations of Julie semi-frequently and often refers to Karen and Phoebe as 'Julie' by mistake. Tommy takes Phoebe and Adam to an abandoned house deep in the nearby Oxoboxo Woods. A number of the living impaired who were abandoned by their families reside there and refer to it as 'The Haunted House'. Tommy takes Phoebe upstairs and shows her the 'Wall of the Dead' - a wall of photographs of zombie kids from all over the country. He then tells her to lie down on the floor in the darkness. When she does, he leaves her there for a short time. She becomes frightened and Tommy later tells her that now she knows how it feels to be dead. Tommy invites Phoebe to his house so he can show her his blog on a website called mysocalledundeath.com, which he uses to get in touch with other undead teenagers and to campaign for rights for the living impaired. Phoebe, knowing that her parents will disapprove of her associating with a dead boy, asks Adam and Margi to cover for her. It has been established by now that Adam has feelings for Phoebe and is unhappy about her developing relationship with Tommy, but he agrees. He and Margi visit the Oxoboxo Lake, where Colette drowned a few years earlier. When she was alive, Colette was best friends with Phoebe and Margi (the three of them being collectively known as 'The Weird Sisters') but they haven't spoken since her death, which is a source of constant guilt and misery for Margi. Soon after in Undead Studies, Colette tells the class about her experiences following her return from death. She walked seven miles from the morgue to her family home, where her mother screamed at her to go away and her father threatened her with a shovel. (The family later left Oakvale without Colette.) She then went to a friend's house but was turned away again. Margi bursts into tears and protests that she was scared, ultimately revealing that this 'friend' was her. She runs out of the class, whilst Phoebe stays and reconciles with Colette. Margi later refuses to return to the class and is removed from the program. Meanwhile, all over the country, undead teenagers are being brutally 'reterminated' (i.e. killed permanently, which involves the irreparable destruction of the brain). There are no laws against murdering zombies since they are, technically, already dead. Furthermore, since the differently biotic are widely shunned by living society, the stories of their murders do not even make it into the news. Tommy is constantly doing research into the crimes against the undead, and presents his findings at each meeting of the Undead Studies class. Many of the reterminations seem to involve a mysterious 'white van', suggesting that the killings are planned and systematic. Phoebe and the other living students are horrified, whilst the undead members of the class are unsurprised and seem quite aware that many people would like to see them destroyed. Phoebe and Tommy finally go out on a date and see a movie, after which Tommy asks her to the homecoming dance. He tells her she doesn't have to answer straight away, though she later says yes. Pete makes his first move against the members of the Undead Studies class. His first target is Evan Talbot, a red-headed zombie with a sense of humour that Adam is fond of. Pete, with help from Stavis and Harris, reterminates Evan using a maul. Adam, who was aware of the threats Pete was making towards the living impaired kids, suspects he is the perpetrator, and Pete indirectly confirms his suspicions. Tommy arranges a meeting at the Haunted House to discuss Evan's murder. There, Phoebe and Adam meet Takayuki, a dead boy with a large section of his right cheek missing (leading to Adam nicknaming him 'Smiley') and a marked dislike for the living. When Adam reveals that it was Pete who killed Evan, Tommy announces that they will go to the police with the information. Takayuki is disgusted by this, believing that the police will do nothing, and he and a few other zombies leave. Tommy and Karen then announce their plans to host a party at the Haunted House after homecoming, since many of the undead kids will be unable to attend the dance. Phoebe feels that Adam was being rude and insensitive at the meeting, especially to Takayuki, and they have their first argument. On the school bus the next day, Margi tells Phoebe that she is coming back to Undead Studies. Colette approaches them; Margi apologises to her and Colette invites her to the homecoming party at the Haunted House. Later, Margi and Phoebe ask Karen how she died and she tells them, to their shock, that she committed suicide by taking an overdose. The homecoming dance seems to go smoothly, but unbeknownst to Phoebe and the others, Pete's next target is Tommy, and he plans on attacking him at the after-party (which he found out about by bullying the information out of Thornton). He and Stavis (it is mentioned that Harris, after assisting in Evan's murder, has refused to be part of Pete's schemes any longer) follow the group to the Haunted House. Tommy and Phoebe go outside into the woods to talk. Tommy tells her that he died in a car crash that also killed his father, and reveals that the zombies with the highest level of functionality are the ones who are loved by their friends or families even after their deaths. (This explains why zombies like Colette, who was abandoned by her family and, until recently, ignored by her friends, move and speak so slowly.) Tommy states his belief that if he can get a living girl to fall in love with him and kiss him, he'll come 'back to life' even more. Phoebe has been concerned for a while that Tommy is only interested in her because she is alive, and this seems to confirm her fears. Pete, who has been watching them, is gripped by a hallucination ‚Äì instead of Phoebe, he sees Julie, and believes that she is about to cheat on him with Tommy. He is armed with a gun, which he intended to use to shoot Tommy, but instead takes aim at Phoebe. Meanwhile, back at the party, Karen advises Adam to tell Phoebe how he feels about her. He goes to find her and hears her screams. Following the sound, he sees Pete about to shoot. Without hesitation, he throws himself into the line of fire and is shot in the chest. Realizing what they've done, Stavis and Pete flee the scene. Pete is caught by Takayuki, who inflicts an injury on Pete's face similar to his own. The screams and gunshot alert the rest of the party-goers to the confrontation, and everyone emerges from the Haunted House and gathers around Adam while Phoebe cries out at them to help, though she knows that Adam is already dead. However, within minutes he returns from death, and is at first completely unaware that he was killed. He realizes something is wrong when he tries to talk and move as normal and finds he can't, and then Phoebe tells him what happened. He tries to tell her that he loves her, but manages only an incoherent gurgle. When the police and an ambulance finally arrive, Phoebe decides that she is going to do everything in her power to bring Adam back as much as possible. Characters Phoebe Kendall ('Pheeble') is one of the main characters in the books, she is described as being a goth who is tall, has a thin slightly curved frame, with hazel/green eyes and long black messy hair. It is stated that her angular features make her face seem heart shaped. She is said to wear mostly all black clothing consisting of heeled boots and dresses or skirts. She enjoys bands such as 'The Creeps', 'Slipknot', 'The Killdeaths', 'Misfits', 'The Rosedales', 'Serphim Shade' and various other emo/goth bands. Margi is Phoebes best friend in the books. She is described as having short spiky pink hair with spiky bangs, having a short frame with large boobs and slightly chubbier body.

These are ready for immediate use at the instant that the mains electricity fails, but the relatively small and finite amount of stored energy they contain makes them suitable for short periods of use, typically in the order of a few dozen minutes to a couple of hours depending on the actual load. To get uninterruptible and continuous power supply, a diesel-generator back-up system is needed along with a fuel supply plan that includes on-demand replacement. Diesel rotary uninterruptible power supply devices (DRUPS) combine the functionality of a battery-powered or flywheel- powered UPS and a diesel generator. When mains electricity supply is within specification, an electrical generator with a mass functions as motor to store kinetic energy in an electro-mechanical flywheel. In combination with a reactor or choke coil, the electrical generator also works as active filter for all sorts of power quality problems, like harmonics, RFI, and frequency variations. When mains electricity supply fails, stored energy in the flywheel is released to drive the electrical generator, which continues to supply power without interruption. At the same time (or with some delay, for example 2 to 11 seconds, to prevent the diesel engine from starting at every incident), the diesel engine takes over from the flywheel to drive the electrical generator to make the electricity required. The electro-magnetic flywheel can continue to support the diesel generator in order to keep a stable output frequency. Typically a DRUPS will have enough fuel to power the load for days or even weeks in the event of failure of the mains electricity supply. The main advantages of DRUPS equipment compared to battery-powered UPS combined with a diesel-generator are the higher overall system energy efficiency, smaller footprint, use of fewer components, longer technical lifetime (no use of power electronics) and the fact it does not result in chemical waste (no use of batteries). The main disadvantages of DRUPS equipment are a more frequent maintenance regimen due to the number of moving parts. DRUPS are also typically installed in external buildings due to noise concerns from the generators. A DRUPS can provide a ride-through time of 15‚Äì40 seconds. A flywheel UPS can be installed ahead of typical UPS battery systems to reduce the effects of lightning & switching transients and to increase battery life.

The Kaiser Wilderness stretches along an east-west ridge and is separated from the High Sierra by the South Fork San Joaquin River canyon. It is a miniature version of the Sierra, with elevations from to at Kaiser Peak, and is composed of glacier-scoured granite blocks, cirques, lakes, granitic cliffs and alpine peaks. Although a small wilderness, it is part of the almost contiguous federal wilderness areas along the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range with the John Muir Wilderness on the east, and Ansel Adams Wilderness to the northeast. Immediately south is Huntington Lake, a rustic summer time resort area. China Peak Ski Resort lies south of the Wilderness as well The forest consists of white fir, Jeffrey pine, red fir, western white pine, and mountain hemlock. On Kaiser Ridge there are stands of lodgepole pine, and at timberline whitebark pine and Sierra juniper grow in mats of krummholtz. Willows and alders grow along the perennial streams that form the drainage area of the South Fork of the San Joaquin River. Some of the popular lakes in the Kaiser Wilderness are Nellie Lake, George Lake, and Upper Twin Lake, with Upper Twin Lake having a cave where the outlet stream disappears into and then flows underground for several hundred yards before resurfacing. Recreational activities include day hiking, backpacking, horseback riding, fishing, rock scrambling, nature photography and snowshoeing. A wilderness permit is required for overnight trips into the Kaiser Wilderness.

The largest of the romance novel subgenres, contemporary romance novels usually reflect the mores of their time. Heroines in the contemporary romances written prior to 1970 usually quit working when they married or had children, while those novels written after 1970 usually have, and keep, a career.Ramsdell (1999), p. 43. As contemporary romance novels have grown to contain more complex plotting and more realistic characters, the line between this subgenre and the genre of women's fiction has blurred. Most contemporary romance novels contain elements that date the books, and the majority of them eventually become irrelevant to more modern readers and go out of print.Ramsdell (1999), p. 44. Those that survive the test of time, such as the works of Jane Austen are often reclassified as historical romances. In a 2014 survey of romance readers, contemporary romance made up 41% of print and 44% of ebook sales compared to other romance subgenres. Contemporary romance novels have twice been chosen by Kelly Ripa to be featured in her Reading with Ripa book club. Subgenres Contemporary romance novels may, in turn, be categorized into several subgenres, sometimes mixing with other main subgenres of romance novels. Subgenres include: * General contemporary romance * Contemporary Romantic Suspense * Baby Love * Medical romance * Cowboy contemporary romance * Glamour & Jet Set * Humorous contemporary romance * International Lovers * Love in the Workplace * Vacation Love * Lesbian romance * Amnesia, that is memory loss, often including some former relationship Baby love This subgenre includes pregnancy, babies or children. One obstacle for making plots in this sense is to adapt to an ongoing increase in women who independently foster their children without any partner. Nobody's Baby But Mine by Susan Elizabeth Phillips is an example of this subgenre. Medical romance Medical romance novels may generally be regarded as a subcategory of contemporary romance, as well as of medical fiction, but has its own type of setting and characters, although it yet can be as multifarious as any other subgenre. The setting usually involves a medical workplace, often the emergency department, but also airborne medicine, family medicine and obstetrics and gynaecology. Regarding characters, the central male protagonists (heroes) are almost always medical doctors, mostly emergency physicians, primary care physicians or surgeons, and sometimes obstetricians/neonatologists or pediatricians. The female protagonists (heroines) are mostly medical doctors but also often nurses, working in primary care, obstetrics/neonatology, training or residency programs, surgery, anesthesiology or emergency medicine. The doctors are almost always ingenious, the male ones usually being tallish, husky and chiseled, while nurses are strong but caring. Patients bring a lot of potential for subplots. They mostly get completely recovered, regardless of the severity of their injury or disease. Almost no plot, however, includes a doctor-patient or nurse-patient relationship, since it is a code for professional health care workers to avoid intimate relationships with patients, as a part of a professional doctor-patient relationship.The Seductive Patient American Family Physician, Sept 1, 2000 by Cheryl Winchell The plot often includes pregnancyThe Unexplained Popularity Of Pregnant Protagonists - via internet archive by Lynne Marshall and children. Lesbian romance This subgenre is an important part of literature and has been prevalent since the mid 1700s. The lesbian romance genre is often a subgenre of broader genres such as BDSM romance, paranormal romance, coming-of-age romance, fantasy romance, and inspirational romance.

After Aardsma was stabbed, the wound produced only a small amount of visible blood. Also, Aardsma was wearing a red dress at the time. As result of these two facts, the first responders thought that perhaps she had experienced a seizure or some other medical ailment. It was not until Aardsma was examined at the Health Center that anyone realized that she had been stabbed. Aardsma's murder remains unsolved, and the Pennsylvania State Police are still actively seeking information on the case.. Author Derek Sherwood and investigative journalist David DeKok each published books incriminating Penn State professor Richard Haefner for Aardsma's murder. Haefner was a respected geologist whose relationship with Aardsma had been terminated by the victim.

It remained the main field artillery gun of the Norwegian Army until the German invasion of Norway in 1940. The Germans impressed the surviving guns and used them in Norway for the duration of the Second World War. They equipped German units in Norway and were used as coastal artillery guns; a number were even modified for use as anti-tank guns. A dozen guns were transferred by the Norwegian government to Finland during the Winter War and were used by them during the Continuation War as well. The Model 1901 guns were obsolescent already during the inter-war period and were retired from active use by the Norwegians shortly after the end of the Second World War. Model 1901s are still employed as saluting guns at fortresses in Norway. Background=Swedish-Norwegian artillery committee With the background of the rapid development of the artillery arm in the late 19th century and the invention of the quick-firing field gun, a Swedish-Norwegian artillery committee was established in 1899. The committee was to facilitate the procurement of new artillery for the Swedish and Norwegian armed forces. The new weapon was to solve the old time-consuming problem of the gun being pushed out of position by recoil with each shot. The committee consisted of six officers, three Swedish and three Norwegian. One of the Norwegian officers was Captain Georg Stang, the future Norwegian Minister of Defence in 1900-1902 and 1902-1903. The Swedish-Norwegian committee reached only a single conclusion; that the calibre of the new weapon was to be 7.5 centimetres, based on tests with a French Schneider-Canet Model 1898 field gun. Four Schneider-Canet had been delivered to Norway at that time, and 16 more were on order. While the Swedish members of the committee wished for a conclusion to be reached in the shortest possible time, the Norwegians wished to bide their time and study the issue to the fullest. The reason for the Norwegians' lack of haste was probably that breech-loaded rifled guns had been introduced to the Norwegian Army only in 1887, and with the last of the Krupp 8.4 cm Model 1887s delivered in 1896 the Norwegian guns were still comparatively new. The Swedes on the other hand had replaced their rifled muzzle-loaders already in 1883 and were more ready for a replacement. Trials and choice of gun In the end nine different artillery systems were considered by the Norwegians, and eight bought or loaned for testing. Two guns were found to be within requirements, one 7.5 cm gun from Schneider-Canet and one of the same calibre from Rheinische Metallwaren- und Maschinenfabrik in Germany. After extensive testing under varied conditions, both summer and winter, during the years 1899-1901, and modifications of the artillery pieces to Norwegian specifications, the Ehrhardt 7.5 cm Model 1901 was chosen. The tests were carried out by the Field and Mountain Artillery School, and included a march across the Dovrefjell mountains to Stj√∏rdal in Nord-Tr√∏ndelag.Gamst 1998: 25 The Norwegian Ministry of Defence, now under the leadership of Georg Stang, chose the artillery system over protests from the opposition Conservative Party of Norway, which demanded that a new system from Krupp be tested before the new gun could be chosen. This criticism was brushed aside by the Ministry of Defence, stating that the military assessment had found the Model 1901 to be the best gun. Before the Ministry of Defence had reached its decision it tested a battery of Model 1901s against a battery of 7.5 cm Schneider-Canet guns. After further testing the Model 1901 was still considered the best choice, although it was decided that further changes to the design were needed.Zeiner-Gundersen 1986: 396 Procurement of the Model 1901 manoeuvres in 1904. In all 138 Ehrhardt 7.5 cm Model 1901s were manufactured, the type being delivered only to Norway. The Norwegian experience with the new system for quick-firing led to the major arms factories in Europe all adopting the same type of recoil system for their own artillery systems. Norwegian companies also modified the Armed Forces' older guns with the new recoil system so they could remain in service longer. Components that could be manufactured in Norway was produced under licence at Norwegian factories, with Norwegian labour organizations pushing for the creation of new jobs for the work force. The Ehrhardt Model 1901 was designated 7,5cm feltkanon M/1901 in Norwegian military service. The purchase of modern artillery for the Norwegian Army was motivated by the military build-up leading to the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905.Zeiner-Gundersen 1986: 50 General characteristics The new artillery pieces consisted of a core tube and mantlet with a mechanism retainer, 28 rifles, Nordenfelt eccentric screw and hydraulic brakes with a spring system for returning the tube to position. This made the Model 1901 Norway's first quick-firing gun. The gun's range was , firing a standard shell. The Model 1901 was long, with a barrel length of .Gander & Chamberlain 1975: 22 The gun shields of the Model 1901 were detachable. Further development in Norway Model 1901 modified for motorized transport. In the first years after 1901 the Model 1901's full potential could not be exploited due to a lack of effective aiming systems. The artillery pieces were delivered with open sights and could only be used for direct fire. New aiming systems were only introduced in 1911, when the field guns were modified at Kongsberg Armaments Factory and fitted with Goerz panoramic telescopes. This, together with other technical advances and the introduction of forward artillery observers, allowed effective indirect fire to be carried out.Zeiner-Gundersen 1986: 398 Ammunition Up until 1921 the ammunition used by the Norwegian artillery was the black-powder case shot and the high-explosive case shot. A high-explosive artillery shell with significantly longer range was introduced in 1921, but not put into regular use. A gas shell was also designed and approved in 1921, although never put into production.Zeiner-Gundersen 1986: 51 Modifications During the 1920s complaints about the performance of the gun started coming in to the authorities. Wear and tear was beginning to have an effect on the guns, and soon people were suggesting that the type should be replaced with a new field gun model. The demands for a new artillery system was rejected, and instead the old guns were sent to a full maintenance overhaul. The maintenance solved the problems with the Model 1901, some guns also being fitted with rubber tires and rebuilt for motor transport during the 1930s. By 1940 at least 12 artillery pieces had been modified for motor transport. Until 9 April 1940 German invasion of Norway the gun remained the main field gun of the Norwegian Army. Second World War=Norwegian Campaign at Narvik. On 9 April 1940 Nazi Germany invaded Norway, capturing ports along the Norwegian coast from Oslo to Narvik. The main field artillery piece of the Norwegian Army that faced the invasion forces was the Ehrhardt Model 1901.Holm 1987: 25 During the two months of fighting in the Norwegian Campaign that followed the Norwegian field artillery arm suffered greatly from organizational difficulties. The difficulties originated in part from the fact that very few artillery pieces had been mobilized during the seven months of neutrality that preceded the invasion. The units that had been activated to guard Norwegian neutrality had been equipped mainly with rifles and light and heavy machine guns.Holm 1987: 47 In the confusion and chaos that followed the German invasion most Norwegian units were only mobilized on an improvised basis, with limited supplies and little time to get properly organized before going into battle with the Germans. Only in Northern and Western Norway did the units (the 6th Division in Northern Norway and the 4th Brigade in Western Norway) have time to mobilize in an orderly fashion.Holm 1987: 71 Due to the complete lack of dedicated anti-tank guns in the Norwegian Army, Model 1901s were pressed into service in an improvised anti-tank role during the fighting in Eastern Norway. The field guns were used in direct fire mode at close range against German Panzers.Zeiner-Gundersen 1986: 195, 196, 200 All 12 of the Model 1901 field guns that had been converted to motorized transport were deployed to Northern Norway at the outbreak of war, with four in Troms County and eight in the eastern parts of Finnmark. Seven of these guns saw action on the Narvik front, supporting the Norwegian counter-offensive against Eduard Dietl's Gebirgsj√§gers.Zeiner-Gundersen 1986: 207 In Finnish service Artillery Museum of Finland. As part of its covert support for Finland during the 1939-1940 Winter War, the Norwegian government donated a field artillery battalion to the Finnish Army in February 1940. The guns were taken from stocks of artillery that had become surplus to requirement after large-scale cuts to the Norwegian military during the interwar period. The artillery pieces were delivered in response to a request for arms supplies from the Finnish foreign minister V√§in√∂ Tanner on 8 December 1939. In addition to artillery the Finns had also requested various types of ammunition, fighter aircraft and hand grenades, weapons that Norway could not provide. The secret transfer of the Model 1901 guns to Finland was a clear violation of the rules of neutrality on behalf of the Norwegian government.Hobson 2001: 256‚Äì257 The 12 guns were delivered with 7,166 shells via the Swedish Bofors armaments company. In Finland the guns were given the designation 75 K 01. Eleven of the guns saw service in the Winter War with Field Artillery Regiment 9, firing some 36,400 shells during the conflict. More ammunition for the guns were later procured by the Finnish Army from Norwegian ammunition stocks captured by the Germans in 1940. During the Continuation War the guns were first issued to the fortification artillery, from 1942 being transferred to the coastal artillery arm. In German service When Nazi Germany conquered Norway in the two-month-long Norwegian Campaign in 1940 they captured many examples of the Norwegian 7,5cm feltkanon M/1901 and re-designated them 7,5 cm FK 246(n). The guns remained in German service in Norway until the end of the war, amongst other uses deployed in coastal artillery fortifications. During their 1940‚Äì1945 occupation of Norway the Germans rebuilt at least 17 Model 1901s as anti-tank guns. Post-war use Model 1901 used as saluting gun during the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 After the end of the Second World War the 7,5cm feltkanon M/1901 was quickly replaced with more modern types in the Norwegian Army. The last time the artillery system was used for sharpshooting exercises was with the concluding exercise of the Field Artillery's Officer School in August 1947 at Hjerkinn training area. Following the type's retirement from active duty the Model 1901 has continued into the 21st century as a saluting gun at many Norwegian fortresses, including at Akershus Fortress in Oslo. The gun had a central role in the 2005 commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905.

Founded in 1957 by the Dominican sisters, it is one of six Dominican educational institutions in the Philippines. Its sister schools are Siena College Quezon City, and Siena College San Jose del Monte, Bulacan. It also offers education for the Third Order of Saint Dominic, known as the Tertiaries'.' History In 1956, the late Cardinal Rufino Santos of the Archbishop of Manila invited the Dominican sisters to establish an academy for the education of local children. In 1957, Saint Catherine Academy opened during the tenure of the late Mother Natividad Pilapil O.P., the Superior General of the Congregation. The college's facility was originally located in the Parish compound of St. John the Baptist in Taytay, Rizal. In 1965, the kindergarten, elementary and secondary education courses were fully established and recognized by the Philippine Department of Education, Culture and Sports (now DepEd). Facilities The college's campus in Taytay is now located at East Rodriguez Avenue, Siena Heights, Barangay San Isidro, Taytay, Rizal. The main and oldest, facility, the three-storey Saint Catherine Building located at the town proper adjacent to the Saint John the Baptist Parish church, was gutted by fire in 2002 and was not rebuilt. At the new location, a four-story building was constructed. This has a number of classrooms and a large Speech Laboratory in the newly added third floor. There are also houses for freshman high school students. The Mother Natividad Pilapil O.P.

In 1931 Younger's merged with McEwan‚Äôs to form Scottish Brewers, which in turn merged with Newcastle Breweries in 1960 to form Scottish & Newcastle. By the late 1960s the combine employed the largest single workforce in the city. The company‚Äôs UK operations were taken over by Heineken in 2008. In October 2011 the Bedford-based Wells & Young's Brewery announced that it had purchased the Younger's and McEwan's brands from Heineken UK.  Younger family  William Younger (1733‚Äì1769) The Younger family home was in the village of Linton (now West Linton), Peeblesshire, where their house still stands. Younger‚Äôs father was a farmer, vintner and bailie. The surname may be of Dutch or Flemish origin (possibly from Yonckeers). A William Younger of Flemish extraction is recorded in a Berwickshire legal document of 1515, and a John Younger of Cockburnspath, Berwickshire was accused of cattle-stealing in 1559. The first Younger recorded at Linton is Thomas Younger, whose will, dated 17 February 1597, is held by Register House in Edinburgh. One family member was a Commissioner of Militia for Peeblesshire in the reign of Charles II. Others were elders of the Kirk in the reign of William II and one, around 1700, was a Writer to the Signet. In 1749, William Younger left home for Edinburgh, aged 16, and whilst it is often speculated that he found employment in Robert Anderson's brewhouse in Leith, there is no documentary evidence for this.B Ritchie, Good Company, The Story of Scottish & Newcastle, London 1999, In 1753 he met his future wife Grizel Cochrane Syme, who was also from Linton. Thanks to her family connections (Thomas Cochrane, later 8th earl of Dundonald, was a Commissioner of Excise), it appears that before their marriage William became an exciseman. As second watchman at the new Leith Glass Works, he oversaw the collection of Government duty on manufactured bottles. When his father died in 1755, he inherited a share of the family‚Äôs wealth, and this, together with his exciseman‚Äôs salary of ¬£25 per annum, enabled him to marry. A year later, he was promoted at the age of twenty-five to be one of the \\"Excise Surveyors of Edinburgh and precincts\\" on a salary of ¬£60 per annum. As his personal wealth increased in the 1760s, Younger bought land, a house, a share in a ship, a co-partnership in a stage coach company and a share in brewery premises near the Kirkgate, Leith. In 1768 he increased the storage facilities for the brewery by purchasing seven large cellars, two dwelling houses and a large warehouse in Broad Wynd. Shortly thereafter he joined three friends in taking over the Edinburgh-Leith stage coach company. He also bought a part share in a brig on the London-Leith run, named William of Leith which also carried cargo as far afield as Hamburg and Danzig. Overworked and ill by the end of 1769, Younger died on 5 May of that year. His widow Grizel married Leith brewer Alexander Anderson and continued to brew under the name Grizel Younger Anderson until 1794.  Family firm  The Grassmarket, Edinburgh by W L Leitch (featuring a beer cart) In 1778 one of Younger‚Äôs sons, Archibald Campbell Younger, having served his apprenticeship under Anderson, established his own brewery within the precincts of the Abbey of Holyroodhouse. This began an association of the area with brewing which lasted until demolition of the Abbey Brewery in the 1990s. The move made good business sense, because at that time several hundred people lived within the Abbey sanctuary and ale brewed there escaped the two pennies Scots custom levied by Edinburgh Town Council after 1693 on every pint brewed within the town walls. Younger‚Äôs strong ale was sold in the taverns of the High Street, the Cowgate and the Grassmarket in Edinburgh‚Äôs Old Town. Robert Chambers, in his Traditions of Edinburgh, writes of Johnnie Dowie‚Äôs Tavern in Libberton‚Äôs Wynd (swept away by the creation of George IV Bridge), \\"Johnnie Dowie‚Äôs was chiefly celebrated for ale ‚Äì Younger‚Äôs Edinburgh ale ‚Äì a potent fluid which almost glued the lips of the drinker together, and of which few, therefore, could despatch more than a bottle\\".R Chambers, Traditions of Edinburgh, W & R Chambers Ltd. 1980, p.167, In 1786 Younger acquired a second, larger brewery at Croft-an-Righ, an ancient lane bordering the eastern precinct wall of the Abbey. In 1793 he opened new and even larger premises in the North Back Canongate (now Calton Road) on a site that disappeared later with the building of Waverley Station. The new brewery had two malt floors, each a hundred feet long, a spring water well, and ten tuns each capable of brewing thirty barrels.  19th-century growth  Meanwhile, another of William Younger‚Äôs sons, William II, had started his own brewhouse within the Abbey precincts and had begun penetrating the London market. In the Morning Post Gazetter of 19 May 1802 his London agent reported the arrival of \\"Mr. William Younger‚Äôs much admired ALE, in casks and bottles, which, being carefully selected by himself from the stock of that famous brewer, will be found on trial to surpass in strength and flavour any ever offered to sale in London\\". In 1803 William moved premises after buying an existing brewhouse, malt barn, kiln house, stables and dwelling house in the narrow lane between the Canongate and the Abbey known as Horse Wynd. In The Beauties of Scotland, Robert Forsyth stated that \\"The ale which has acquired the highest reputation, and is now bought up with great avidity in London and other distant markets, is that prepared by two brothers who carry on business separately, Messrs Younger\\". In 1806, however, Archibald and William collaborated in producing a London-style porter for the Scottish market which was sold under the name of A.C. and W. Younger. The Abbey Brewery in the Canongate After Archibald died, aged 62, in 1819, William, now 52, arranged the sale of his brother‚Äôs brewery and in 1825 expanded his own by purchasing property on the opposite side of Horse Wynd for ¬£5,000. This, together with neighbouring ground acquired in 1829, was the site which developed into the Abbey Brewery, with which the name Younger‚Äôs would become chiefly associated. By the 1830s Younger‚Äôs ales were being sold all over Scotland, the north east of England and London. By the time of his death in 1842 William had joined forces with fellow brewer, Alexander Smith, and was exporting Scotch ales to New York and St. Louis in the United States, as well as Britain‚Äôs overseas colonies. After William II‚Äôs death, his son William III and Smith‚Äôs son, Andrew, expanded the business as partners in the 1840s, concentrating particularly on the North American market while also sending hogsheads on clippers bound for Bombay and Adlelaide. William II‚Äôs grandson, William IV, joined the business at this stage as it continued to prosper. He took over running the firm with Smith after William III died in 1854. During the Crimean War the company won a lucrative government contract to supply beer to the army. By 1856 San Francisco was receiving regular shipments, and in the following year Philadelphia, Montreal, Baltimore and New Orleans joined the rapidly growing list of new markets, as did the Caribbean islands, Buenos Aires and even Honolulu. Pub sign on one of Younger's former London pubs In 1858 the Abbey Brewery began to expand following the acquisition of adjacent brewery premises and, a little later, Brodie‚Äôs Land further up the Canongate. This was the area between the Canongate and the South Back Canongate (now Holyrood Road) which was developed as the Holyrood Brewery. New storage was also built at Park Stores, Abbeyhill next to the old Croft-an-Righ site. At about the same time, the premises on the Palace side of Horse Wynd were abandoned to become royal property on the initiative of Prince Albert. The company opened its London branch office at St. Paul‚Äôs Wharf, Upper Thames Street in 1861. By the 1930s the firm had acquired a number of traditional pubs in the London area, styled \\"Scotch Houses\\", including Ye Olde London on Ludgate Hill, which began life as the London Coffee House in 1731. The London branch moved eventually to Princes Wharf, Commercial Road, Lambeth, in 1932 and was sold off in the 1970s to make way for part of the South Bank Development. In 1869 both Younger and Smith retired from the business, passing control to three partners: William III‚Äôs younger sons, Henry and David, and Smith‚Äôs son Alexander. William IV died in 1886.  20th-century developments  By the beginning of the 20th century it was reckoned that Younger‚Äôs was producing a quarter of all Scotland's beer. The company‚Äôs overseas trade had grown so rapidly that 80,000 barrels a year were leaving the London stores alone for sixty overseas-based agencies. Cargoes were being carried from Leith to Belgium which became a principal market; private customers included the Czar of Russia and his household; and deliveries were finding their way across the world to destinations ranging alphabetically from Alexandria to Zanzibar. 'Father William' on a Scottish Brewers' beer label Growth continued throughout the Great War, and in 1920 the firm installed its first bottling plant for new fashioned chilled and carbonated beers in the Holyrood Brewery. Scotch Ale, Nos.1, 2 and 3 (resembling English Burton ales) began to rival India Pale Ale in popularity. Alfred Leete‚Äôs ‚ÄòFather William‚Äô trade mark appeared for the first time at the end of the 1920s. Despite its healthy level of authorised capital and dividends, the onset of the Depression in 1930 induced the board to propose a merger of the company with its great Edinburgh rival McEwan‚Äôs to form a new combine to be known as Scottish Brewers Ltd. with effect from 6 December 1931. While both companies continued to produce their own ales marketed under their own names, they now shared financial and technical resources; and exports were handled by a new company, McEwan-Younger Ltd. From 1951 to 1970 this fell under the Directorship of Stenhard Landale FRSE. Scottish Brewers continued to increase its market share in the brewing sector, doubling its output after a costly five-year programme of expansion and modernisation undertaken between 1958 and 1963.D Keir, The Third Statistical Account of Scotland: The City of Edinburgh, Collins 1966, p.630 The company eventually merged with Newcastle's Tyne Brewery in 1960 to form Scottish & Newcastle Ltd., a giant of the British brewing industry until its joint takeover by Carlsberg and Heineken group, in 2008. Heineken acquired the British business. The Abbey Brewery had closed in 1956 to be redeveloped as the Head Office of Scottish & Newcastle. The Holyrood Brewery closed in 1986. Both sites are now occupied by the buildings of the devolved Scottish Parliament.  21st-century developments  In late 2011, the Younger and McEwans brands were sold by Heineken to Wells and Young's. In May 2017, the brands and were sold by Charles Wells Ltd to Marston's as part of a bigger deal which included the Eagle Brewery.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england- beds-bucks-herts-39959394  See also  * Beer in Scotland  References  Further reading  B Ritchie, Good Company, The Story Of Scottish & Newcastle, London 1999, Category:Manufacturing companies based in Edinburgh Category:Defunct breweries of the United Kingdom ","title":"Younger's Brewery"},{"id":"18759345","text":"Chen Haixia (born 11 February 1987 in Zengcheng, Guangdong) is a female Chinese rower.

Directed by Filipp Yankovsky, it was one of the most expensive films ever made in Russia.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450158/ A revolutionary organisation is planning to assassinate the Governor of Moscow as the first step to overthrowing the Tsarist state. Detective Erast Fandorin attempts to counter them, but his efforts are hindered by his dealings with Prince Pozharsky. The film's promotional title in Russian uses the old-fashioned, pre-Revolutionary spelling –°—Ç–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–æ–≤—£—Ç–Ω–∏–∫—ä which contrasts with the modern spelling –°—Ç–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫. Plot The film is set in the Russian Empire at the turn of the 19th century. The Petersburg-Moscow train stops at the Klin station, the last one before Moscow. In the special wagon where under high security travels the minister of the tsarist government ‚Äì Adjutant-General Khrapov, a man appears who introduces himself as the state councilor Erast Fandorin, an official for special assignments to the Moscow governor-general responsible for Khrapov's security in Moscow. The arriving person presents the documents and because he matches to the verbal portrait of Fandorin which the guards are familiar with, he is let in to see the general. Soon the general is found dead in the compartment and on the handle of the bloody blade there is a mark \\"BG\\" ‚Äì sign of the elusive terrorist \\"Combat Group\\" which wreaks terror in both capitals. The terrorist who impersonated Fandorin ‚Äì head of the \\"BG\\" nicknamed Green ‚Äì successfully disappears from the scene of the crime and settles in Moscow with three accomplices, Rakhmet, Emelya and Snegir, where the local revolutionary, Needle, helps them. Lack of involvement in the case by the real Fandorin is immediately apparent as soon as he meets with the general's guards: the terrorist resembled Fandorin only a little and was made up in order to enhance the similarities. Murder of Khrapov was a \\"slap in the face of power\\", which means the inevitable dismissal of the Moscow Governor-General Dolgorutsky. Frustrated with everything that has happened, Dolgorutsky asks Fandorin, with whom he was always pleased, to do everything to find the general's killers quickly and on his own which will allow him to retire with dignity without being disgraced. Fandorin, famous for his deductive method, starts an investigation and the first clue is given by the terrorists themselves: from the circumstances of the case it is clear that the killers knew who provides the security of the general and had a description of Fandorin's appearance. Fandorin was appointed responsible for Khrapov's visit only the day before, and this was only known to the St. Petersburg Police Department and three employees of the Moscow gendarmerie. Obviously it was only this narrow circle of people who could have leaked the information. Fandorin investigates and manages to detain one of the members of the group, Rakhmet, but from the investigation he is quickly removed by the celebrated investigator, General Prince Pozharsky, who came specially from Petersburg with a nominal command. In the meantime, BG continues to operate, this time replenishing the party cash desk: the treasury coach has been robbed, security has been broken, and a huge amount of money has been stolen. Fandorin decides to find out who passes the information on to BG by giving all suspects different information and checking how the terrorists react. The completely unexpected reaction of BG forces Fandorin to suspect even his own beloved for a moment, but he still finds the correct, albeit incredible, answer to his question. \\"Source\\" of \\"BG\\" is Prince Pozharsky himself. Pozharsky organizes an operation to seize the Combat Group so that in a shootout Fandorin perishes on account of an alleged \\"unbelievable accident\\". But Fandorin remains alive thanks to his dexterity, Snegir and Emelya perish, and only Green remains of the group, who continues to be helped by Needle who fell in love with him. In a private conversation Pozharsky admits that Fandorin's conclusions are correct: the general did supply information to BG initially to use terrorists to get rid of the rivals' and to frighten officials, and then to act as the sole savior of the state that destroyed the elusive group and receive power and privilege for it. Now, after the provoked retirement of Dolgorutsky, the Moscow Governor-General will become the Grand Duke Simeon, the patron of Pozharsky, and Pozharsky himself will rise to the rank of a Moscow Chief Policeman. Fandorin can not openly speak out against Pozharsky: they just would not believe him. Pozharsky suggests that Fandorin become an ally, or simply \\"step aside and remain silent\\". Fandorin chooses the latter, because unlike Pozharsky, he knows that Green had already guessed about the betrayal of his assistant, Julie Renard, through whom Pozharsky slipped the group information about the objects of the terrorist attacks, and Green forced Julie to make an appointment with Pozharsky. As a result, Pozharsky goes on the call of Julie to destroy Green and gain the laurels of the sole winner of the Combat Group, and Fandorin merely tells him in a whisper: \\"Evil devours itself.\\" And thus it indeed happens: Pozharsky kills Green and Julie, but he himself also dies with Needle who sabotaged him and herself, before death to whom he refers by real name ‚Äì Countess Dobrinskaya. The new governor-general offers Fandorin the post of chief policeman and his patronage. At first Fandorin brusquely refuses, but after exhortations of the former governor-general's old servant, he returns to Simeon's office and gives his consent.

In the 4th and 5th century CE, the cave was sanctified and used by Byzantine monks as a Christian holy place. On its walls are some of the earliest drawings known in local Christian art. Structures outside the cave date to the Hellenistic period (2nd century BCE) and indicate that the cave was used as both a water reservoir and a place for bathing. Water was collected from the valley and channeled into the cave via a water-filtering basin. A sluice allowed some of the water to be channeled from the filtering basin into the fields. Archaeologists discovered a flight of 7 steps leading to an underground, man-made rectangular pool of water.

Simmons at his Lexington, Kentucky horse farm, a property that had been part of the renowned Idle Hour Stock Farm. Blue Man's dam was Poppycock, a granddaughter of Man o' War. His sire was Blue Swords, who won several handicaps and ran second to Count Fleet in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. Grandsire Blue Larkspur was the 1929 American Horse of the Year and a U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee. Blue Man was owned by Arthur Abbott of Rye, New York, founder of Abbott's Frozen Custard, who raced him under the White Oak Stable banner. He was trained by future Hall of Fame inductee Woody Stephens. Racing career=Early races At age two Blue Man showed limited racing ability. In the spring of 1952, the then three-year-old colt won the important Flamingo Stakes at Hialeah Park in Florida. In the ensuing Kentucky Derby, he finished third to winner Hill Gail, then won the most important race of his career in the second leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series. 1952 Preakness Stakes Derby winner Hill Gail had to be withdrawn from the Preakness as a result of an injury, but Blue Man still faced a solid field led by Walter M. Jeffords' highly regarded One Count, who was to be ridden by star jockey, Eddie Arcaro. Blue Man was ridden by Conn McCreary, a top jockey and future Hall of Fame inductee who had won the 1944 Preakness and was known for his dramatic come-from behind rides. In typical McCreary style, by the time he and Blue Man reached the three-quarter pole they were at the back of the pack, running ahead of just one other horse. One by one, they began passing the field, then pulled away in the homestretch to win by lengths. For trainer Woody Stephens, Blue Man was his first of nine Preakness starters and his only winner. Later races Sent to compete in the final leg of the Triple Crown, the 1¬Ω mile Belmont Stakes, Blue Man ran second to One Count. That year, Blue Man won other important races such as the Yankee Handicap at East Boston's Suffolk Downs and the Dwyer Stakes held that year at the Old Aqueduct Racetrack. Stud record Retired to stud duty, in 1958 Blue Man was sold to Canadian breeder Frank R. Conklin who stood him at his Midway Farm in Brantford, Ontario. Successful as a sire and damsire, Blue Man produced a number of Canadian stakes race winners.

The export of pineapple products began during Ivory Coast's colonial period, when two processing plants were established with foreign help. History When Ivory Coast gained independence, the export of pineapple products was less than half that of banana products. During the 1960s and 1970s, exports grew steadily, and by the early 1970s, the number of pineapple exports had surpassed the number of banana exports. In the 1980s, Thailand began competing with Ivory Coast, pushing world prices downward. Economic reforms in Ivory Coast reduced subsidies for several state enterprises and closed others, including Corfruitel, the parastatal in charge of marketing fruits, such as pineapples. At this time, most pineapple exports were canned pineapples or pineapple juice. For the reasons highlighted above, exports of these two products had practically disappeared by 1990. At this time, much of the Ivorian pineapple industry switched over to fresh pineapple. In a very advantageous move, it exported these to Europe by sea-freight, using the same refrigerated freighters used for bananas. Ivory Coast once quasi-monopolised the world market on fresh pineapples, although it no longer enjoys that status once Costa Rica, Honduras, Ghana and other suppliers began developing their share of the industry. Farming and production Ivory Coast is Europe's leading pineapple source, supplying over 200,000 tons of fresh fruit a year, or 60% of the European market. On the world scale, Ivory Coast is second only to Costa Rica. Combined, the two produce over 50% of the world's pineapples.

The company's director, Jean Konan Banny, claimed the idea \\"came to [him when he thought] to make a wine from pineapples\\" and was named after his granddaughter, Cristel. He also proposed an alcoholic version of the drink. Research In 1987, scientists at the Institute of Research on Energy Renewal (IREN) studied how to create ethanol from pineapples in Ivory Coast.

It can be used for computing the pH of buffer solutions when the approximations of the Henderson‚ÄìHasselbalch equation break down. The Henderson‚ÄìHasselbalch equation assumes that the autoionization of water is negligible and that the dissociation or hydrolysis of the acid and the base in solution are negligible (in other words, that the formal concentration is the same as the equilibrium concentration). For an acid-base equilibrium such as HA H+ \\\\+ A‚àí, the Charlot equation may be written as :\\\\mathrm{[H^+]} = K_a \\\\frac{C_a - \\\\Delta}{C_b + \\\\Delta} where [H+] is the equilibrium concentration of H+, Ka is the acid dissociation constant, Ca and Cb are the analytical concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base, respectively, and Œî = [H+] ‚àí [OH‚àí]. The equation can be solved for [H+] by using the autoionization constant for water, Kw, to introduce [OH‚àí] = Kw/[H+]. This results in the following cubic equation for [H+], which can be solved either numerically or analytically: :\\\\mathrm{[H^+]^3} + (K_a + C_b)\\\\mathrm{[H^+]^2} - (K_w + K_a C_a)\\\\mathrm{[H^+]} - K_a K_w = 0 Derivation Considering the dissociation of the weak acid HA (e.g., acetic acid): HA H+ \\\\+ A‚àí Starting from the definition of the equilibrium constant :K_a = \\\\mathrm{\\\\frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]}} one can solve for [H+] as follows: :\\\\mathrm{[H^+] = \\\\mathit{K_a} \\\\frac{[HA]}{[A^-]}} The main issue is how to determine the equilibrium concentrations [HA] and [A‚àí] from the initial, or analytical concentrations Ca and Cb. This can be achieved by considering the electroneutrality and mass balance constraints on the system. The first constraint is that the total concentration of cations needs to equal the total concentration of anions, because the system has to be electrically neutral: :\\\\mathrm{[M^+] + [H^+] = [A^-] + [OH^-]} Here M+ is the counterion that comes with the conjugate base, [A‚àí], that is added to the solution. For example, if HA is acetic acid, A‚àí would be acetate, which could be added to the solution in the form of sodium acetate. In this case, M+ would be the sodium cation. The equilibrium concentration [M+] is constant and equal to the analytical concentration of the base, Cb. Therefore, :\\\\mathrm{[A^-] = \\\\mathit{C_b} + [H^+] - [OH^-]} = C_b + \\\\Delta Because of mass balance, the sum of the equilibrium concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base has to remain equal to the sum of their analytical concentrations. (HA may convert into A‚àí and vice versa, but what is lost of HA is gained of A‚àí, keeping the sum constant.) :\\\\mathrm{[HA] + [A^-]} = C_a + C_b Substituting [A‚àí] and solving for [HA]: :\\\\mathrm{[HA]} = C_a - \\\\Delta Introducing the equations for [HA] and [A‚àí] into the equation for [H+] yields the Charlot equation.

He became an esquire in the king's household and was knighted in 1378. He took part in a number of diplomatic missions and became MP for Gloucestershire in 1390, 1393, 1394 and 1399. On the last occasion he was elected Speaker, but stood down on the ostensible grounds of ill-health, but may have been persuaded to do so by the influence of Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, who was appalled by his election and warned the clergy that Cheyne was an inveterate enemy of the contemporary church. The revolution of 1399 made for strange bedfellows. Although Cheyne is never called a Lollard (heretic) by contemporaries, he was a core member of a connection of knights held (with good cause) to be promoters of, or at least sympathetic to, that emerging sect. His testament reflected some of that sect's attitudes but embedded in a good deal of orthodoxy. In that generation after John Wyclif, many sympathisers with the moral and social ideas of that scholar indeed hoped this would not prove incompatible with continuing devotion to orthodox piety and acceptance within the Catholic Church. Under Henry IV he continued to be employed on diplomatic missions, including a two- year trip to Rome in 1407. He acquired property in Beckford, Gloucestershire as his principal estate. Being near to death, he was not implicated in the Oldcastle Rising of 1413/14, which involved a few, but far from all, of the sect, but the Cheynes of Drayton Beauchamp, Buckinghamshire, were, and they seem to have been his eventual heirs after the deaths of his sons.J.S.

Built in 1758, it is one of the nation's finest examples of German-Georgian colonial architecture. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2016. History The stone house was completed in 1758 as were the three cast iron five-plate stoves used to heat the rooms. Only one survives. The house stands on land settled by German immigrant farmer Josef Brunner (later alternately spelled 'Bruner' and 'Brooner') in 1736. In time, Brunner purchased of a 7,000 acre tract land known as \\"Tasker's Chance\\" from Frederick Town (current-day Frederick) developer Daniel Dulany. Brunner named the property after Klein Schifferstadt, his home town in the Rhineland- Palatinate region of southwestern Germany near Mannheim. Brunner's older sons purchased adjacent farms, bringing the total owned by the family to about 1000 acres. Brunner built a log house on the site, cleared land, established a farm and lived there for several years. In 1753, he sold the property to his youngest son Elias, who clearly prospered enough to build the fairly large stone house that stands today. Josef moved into the nearby town of Frederick and is thought to have died later that year. Architecture The sandstone for Schifferstadt's two-foot-thick walls that may have come from a local quarry near Walkersville Maryland. The hand-hewn wood beams were pinned together with wooden pegs. Above the windows and doors on the first floor of the building are reinforcing stone arches, supporting the outside walls above them. The roof is considered to be unusual with kick-up, or flared eaves. The house has a large \\"wishbone\\" chimney, gathering flues from all four fireplaces into one chimney. In the parlor and upstairs bedrooms were three \\"Five Plate\\" cast iron boxes that kept most of the house warm. Also called jamb stoves, these were parts of a clean, energy-efficient radiant heating system, fed by fireplaces in the center hall. One is still there--the only one anywhere known still to be in its original place--and is the basis for dating the house at 1758 because of the date cast into the plates. Much of the original construction and detailing survives, showing particular examples of German influence, including a tightly winding staircase to the second floor. Schifferstadt is known to be the finest existing example of German colonial architecture in the United States. Ownership, disrepair and restoration The house was owned by Brunner's family and descendants until 1899 when it was sold (along with 94 acres) to Frederick resident Edward C. Krantz for $16,000. The house remained in the Krantz family until July 1974 when it was sold to Frederick County Landmarks Foundation. The foundation subsequently restored Schifferstadt and today operates it as an architectural and local history museum. Schifferstadt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 22, 1974 and was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 23, 2016.

During an eight-month campaign in 1915, Commonwealth and French forces sought to force Turkey out of the war, which would relieve the deadlock on the Western Front and open a supply route to Russia through the Dardanelles and the Black Sea. Nomenclature The name Baby 700 originated in cartographic notes on Allied maps. One of the hills in the Sari Bair range was shown as being 700 feet above sea level, and its summit was marked with a small circle. Maps showed another 700 foot hill immediately north of it, marked with a larger circle. These notations led to the names Baby 700 and Big 700 being assigned to them by the Commonwealth forces. Baby 700 retained its name throughout the campaign. Big 700 was later renamed Battleship Hill.

Sonia and its variant spellings Sonja and Sonya are derived from the Russian hypocoristic Sonya, an abbreviation of Sofiya (Greek Sophia \\"Wisdom\\") The name was popularised in the English-speaking world by characters in the novels Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1866, English translation 1885) and War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy (1869, English translation 1886), and later by a 1917 bestselling novel, Sonia: Between Two Worlds, by Stephen McKenna. Sonya and its variations are occasionally found as surnames in England and the American eastern seaboard. Scandinavian countries spell the name with the letter j: Sonja, while many English speaking countries spell it with i or y: Sonia or Sonya. Many other variant spellings exist. Although the most common English pronunciation is , is also possible. As a last name Sonya is an uncommon surname of English origin. Spelling variations include Sonning, Sonnin, Sonin, Soning, Sunning, Sunin, Souning, Sounin, Sonninges, Somin and Somings.

In brief, it states that every complete measure space is decomposable into \\"non-atomic parts\\" (copies of products of the unit interval [0,1] on the reals), and \\"purely atomic parts\\", using the counting measure on some discrete space. The theorem is due to Dorothy Maharam. It was extended to localizable measure spaces by Irving Segal. The result is important to classical Banach space theory, in that, when considering the Banach space given as an L_p space of measurable functions over a general measurable space, it is sufficient to understand it in terms of its decomposition into non-atomic and atomic parts. Maharam's theorem can also be translated into the language of abelian von Neumann algebras. Every abelian von Neumann algebra is isomorphic to a product of œÉ-finite abelian von Neumann algebras, and every œÉ-finite abelian von Neumann algebra is isomorphic to a spatial tensor product of discrete abelian von Neumann algebras, i.e., algebras of bounded functions on a discrete set. A similar theorem was given by Kazimierz Kuratowski for Polish spaces, stating that they are isomorphic, as Borel spaces, to either the reals, the integers, or a finite set.

History  The Edelweiss badge of the German mountain infantry This division was founded as the 10. Panzerdivision of the new German Army in 1959. Originally only consisting of armoured units, it now also commands Germany's last mountain warfare unit. For this reason the Edelweiss badge has become another commonly used insignia to denote allegiance to this formation. The 10th Panzer Division is a part of Germany's permanent contribution to Eurocorps, the other being the German contribution to the Franco-German Brigade which was subordinate to the division until 2006. After 1993 troops of this division participated in numerous overseas deployments. Among them were the first out-of-area land deployment operations for the Bundeswehr (in fact of any German military unit after World War II). Troops were deployed to Somalia (UNOSOM II) from 1993 to 1994 and to Bosnia and Herzegovina (IFOR) from 1995 to 1996 and stayed in this country until 1998 (SFOR). Soldiers of the 10th Panzer Division's SFOR contingent were also involved in the Bundeswehr's first combat operation in 1997 (Operation Libelle). In 2000, the 10th Panzer Division deployed more than 8,000 personnel to the Balkans. Between 2002 and 2003, it deployed to various operations in the Balkans and in Afghanistan.

In 1922 Aldo Piscitello (Umberto Spadaro) is a municipal employee in the town of Modica, Sicily. With the rise of Mussolini to power, he is forced by his boss (Enzo Biliotti) to join the Fascist Party. If he fails to do so, he would lose his job. Piscitello reluctantly joins the Fascists and even backdates his enrollment to 1921. His wife Rosina (Ave Ninchi) and his daughter (Delia Scala) support his move. As a member of the Fascist party, he however maintains contacts to his anti-Fascist friends who meet at the shop of the local pharmacist (Aldo Silvani). The power and the ideology of the Fascists are omnipresent. There are military drills on weekends, public gatherings and secret agents. Even Norma‚Äôs Bellini is censored by the Fascists. Piscitello‚Äôs son Giovanni (Massimo Girotti) returns from the military service and hopes to take up an ordinary life. He marries the daughter of the pharmacist Maria (Milly Vitale) but, as Italy allies with Germany‚Äôs war, he has to re-join the military. The pharmacist is imprisoned after his intonation of the French anthem when Italy declares war against France. 1943: The war returns to Italy and the allies land in Sicily. Piscitello and his family leave their house in order to take refuge on the countryside. At the same time, Giovanni is on furlough. Things take a tragic turn when he is stopped by a unit of fleeing German soldiers. Everyone celebrates the end of the war in Sicily. Piscitello, however, is saddened. Former Fascists claim to be Anti-Fascists. The boss of Piscitello sits with an officer of the US army and sacks Piscitello for his erstwhile membership of the Fascist Party. English-language version In 1949, Lopert Productions hired playwright Arthur Miller to adapt an English- language version of the film which they had obtained rights in.

John Osgood House is a historic late First Period house at 547 Osgood Street in North Andover, Massachusetts. The original part of the house, its left side, was built c. 1720. A second, similar building (without chimney) was then attached to the right side of the chimney at a later date, demonstrating an unusual method of joining the two structures. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The Col. John Osgood House is set on the east side of Osgood Street, just south of a side spur road leading to a condominium complex. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a central chimney, clapboard siding, and an integral rear leanto section giving the house a traditional New England saltbox profile. The front facade is symmetrically arranged, with a projecting central entrance vestibule with a gable pediment. The flanking bays have windows, spaced in groups of two, and there are three gabled dormers projecting from the roof. An enclosed porch extends to the right of the main block. The house is built of two distinct structures, which were joined together in the 18th century. The main portion, built c. 1720 was the leftmost three bays, which included a large central chimney (which has since been rebuilt). To this, probably early in the building's history, a similar structure of equal or older age, was added to the right. The tie beams of the two structures were joined by doubly dovetailed timbers, a method rarely seen for such work in eastern Massachusetts. The house originally faced south, but was rotated on its site to face west when the road was realigned in the early 20th century. At that time the chimney was partially rebuilt to accommodate the new configuration. The porch, front vestibule, and dormers are all 20th century alterations, as is the removal of part of the rear leanto to provide space for a patio. Notable Residents As of 2020, the Col. John Osgood House serves as the winter residence of Sir Louis Michael and Dame Colleen Helen, notable residents of North Andover, Massachusetts.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history The Samuel Osgood House is located east of North Andover's town center, on the west side of Osgood Street, between Stevens Street and the Cochichewick River. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, two interior brick chimneys, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by pilasters and topped by an entablature and gabled pediment. The first-floor windows are topped by similar gables, while the second-floor windows have slightly projecting lintels. The building corners have plain cornerboards, rising to a dentillated cornice. The interior is organized in a center hall plan, with paneled fireplace surrounds. An ell extends to the rear, projecting slightly to the left, and there is a single- story porch projecting to the right. The house was built about 1740, and is a good local example of mid-18th century Georgian architecture. Samuel Osgood was born in this house in 1747; he served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, and was elected to the Continental Congress in 1781. He was appointed the nation's first Postmaster General by President George Washington, and served in other civic roles prior to his death in 1813.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Description and history The former Palmer School building is located west of the Boxford village center, near the junction of Main Street and the south access road for the Harry Cole School. It is a single-story wood frame structure with a gabled roof. It has very minimal Greek Revival styling reflective of its construction date in 1845. The western gable end of the structure has the main door, flanked by windows, while the long side of the building has seven windows, although it previously had only four. The eastern end has three standard double hung windows, with a small eye window in the gable. The building was built in 1845, during a period of prosperity in the town, during which it updated all of its district school buildings. It was used as a school facility from 1845 until 1931. In 1918 it was named in honor of Dr. Julius Palmer, a jeweler who had retired to the town. Its window alterations date to the 1920s. In 1931 it was sold by the town, and was moved to its present location for use as a community center, made as a gift of the purchaser, Edna Rich Morse. It was eventually donated back to the town, and has intermittently been used for a number of municipal functions, including for municipal offices, and as a kindergarten facility.

It is primarily noted for its association with industrialist and philanthropist Edward Searles whose Pine Lodge estate was nearby. Searles, a Methuen native who made a fortune in textiles and the railroad, made major contributions to the development of Methuen around the turn of the 20th century. This Craftsman style house, designed by Henry Vaughan and built in 1910, is a notable architectural element of Searles' legacy. The main block is a 2-1/2 story structure with a side-gable roof, which is extended to the left by a 1-1/2 story ell and to the front by a two-story projection. A shed-roof porch is in the crook to the left of this projection, and the main entrance is in the leftmost ell. The house is generally finished in stucco, with wooden shingles in the gable ends. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. At that time it was thought that this house incorporated elements of a c. 1840 Greek Revival farmhouse belonging to his father Jesse. However, the Jesse Searles House is now known to have been locate on the Searles estate, and was altered. It is possible that this house also incorporates an older building, because Searles was known to move buildings around. This house was sold out of the Searles family by his heirs after his death in 1920.

Peabody House is a historic house at 15 Summer Street in Salem, Massachusetts. Built in 1868 by Salem merchant John P. Peabody, it is a rare early example of Colonial Revival architecture. The two story wood frame house is three bays wide, with a slate gambrel roof. The centered front door is sheltered by a portico supported by Doric columns. The second story center window reinforces focus, being enlarged slightly by sidelights as compared to the other windows on the facade. The roof is pierced by three dormers, the outer ones with pointed gables and the central one with a rounded pediment reminiscent of the then-fashionable Second Empire style. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It is now owned by the Salem Inn, which also owns the nearby West Cogswell House.
