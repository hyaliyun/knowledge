He is believed to be the second-ever comic book superhero whose primary power is speed; All-American Publications' The Flash preceded him by two months.Flash Comics #1 (All-American Publications, Jan. 1940). However, Silver Streak beat out National Allied Publications' Johnny Quick (who debuted in 1941)More Fun Comics # 71 (National Allied Publications, Sept. 1941). as the first superhero whose two powers were speed and flight. Silver Streak has a kid sidekick called \\"Mercury\\" (soon changed to \\"Meteor\\"); he is also assisted by a falcon named \\"Whiz\\". Publication history Silver Streak Comics was originally published by Arthur Bernhardt's Rhoda Publications, and the title was inspired by Bernhardt's car, a Pontiac Silver Streak. With issue #3, the title was taken over by Lev Gleason Publications and Silver Streak himself first appeared. Silver Streak appeared in Silver Streak Comics until issue #19 (March 1942); the title itself ended with #21, and was renamed Crime Does Not Pay. Also during this run, Silver Streak appeared in Lev Gleason's Daredevil #1. In 1945, Silver Streak appeared in the only issue of Dime Comics, and in 1946 he appeared in the 22nd and 23rd final issues of the briefly revived Silver Streak Comics. Since then, the character has fallen into the public domain. In the mid-1980s, Roy Thomas featured the \\"Scarlet Streak\\" in his limited series Alter Ego. In 2008, he appeared in issue #141 of The Savage Dragon, along with a score of other Golden Age heroes. Also in 2008, Silver Streak appeared in flashbacks in issue #0 of Dynamite Entertainment‚Äôs Project Superpowers, a title that uses mostly public domain Golden Age characters. In the one-shot Project Superpowers: Chapter Two Prelude. He later appeared in the related Dynamite miniseries The Death-Defying ‚ÄôDevil. Editor Erik Larsen's \\"Next Issue Project\\" (Image Comics) published Silver Streak Comics \\"#24\\" (Dec. 2009), featuring Silver Streak in one story, written and illustrated by Paul Grist. Fictional biography =Lev Gleason Publications= In Supermen! The First Wave of Comic Book Heroes, Greg Sadowski says that \\"Silver Streak's origin... is one of the most contrived and convoluted stories of the early golden age, and that's saying something.\\" In 1940, a taxicab driver (name unknown) applied for a position as a race car driver (all of the previous drivers of the \\"Silver Streak\\" having been killed by a giant fly sent by a mad scientist named Dr. Katan) and was hypnotized by a mysterious swami (name unknown) into believing \\"You are the Silver Streak‚Äîthe strongest, bravest, fastest man in the world.\\" The cab driver was apparently killed in a crash caused by the fly and was buried, but the swami believed it was \\"merely a hypnotic trance\\" and used his mystical powers to bring him back to life, after which the swami declared \\"It is as I feared, the hypnosis has become part of his mind... he is now all-powerful, a man to be feared!\\" Motivated by a strong desire to make the world a better place, he donned a colorful costume and fought against crime, Nazi spies, and The Claw, calling himself \\"Silver Streak.\\" He had changed costumes a few times over the years, but one detail that remained constant was the arrowhead-shaped emblem on his chest with the shape-fitting ‚ÄúSS‚Äù inside it; curiously, most of his costumes had no silver coloring anywhere on them. He later learned that anyone who receives a transfusion of his blood gains super-speed when a sheik steals it to inject a pet falcon (given the name \\"Whiz\\" in the next issue) who immediately gained speed and kinship with the Silver Streak, and to Mickey O'Toole, a kid sidekick initially called \\"Mercury\\" but who quickly became \\"Meteor.\\" In Silver Streak Comics #5 (July 1940), Jack Cole, who by this time was writing and drawing the character's adventures, directly addressed the readers and explained the hero's motivations: The Streak wears a ring emblazoned with a \\"V\\" for Victory; in one story, he rescues Mercury from the Nazis, and punches Adolf Hitler in the face, leaving a \\"V\\" mark on the dictator's face. =Project Superpowers= At some point after World War II, Silver Streak and other heroes were imprisoned in the mystical Urn of Pandora by the misguided Fighting Yank. Decades later the Urn was broken and the heroes released; Silver Streak emerged (wearing a red and silver costume similar to his original one) just in time to aid his former ally The Death- Defying ‚ÄôDevil against a terrorist attack. Exactly what part this hero will play in the modern world remains to be seen. =Living Legends= The Metahuman Press serial Living Legends has introduced a new version of Silver Streak. This character is an Asian female, native to the fictional city of Riccapoor, home of The Claw.

Nicholson Jr. (7 June 1947 ‚Äì 24 March 1985) was a United States Army military intelligence officer shot by a Soviet sentry while engaged in intelligence-gathering activities as part of an authorized military liaison mission which operated under reciprocal U.S.-Soviet authority. Military liaison missions were ostensibly liaisons between the British, French and U.S. forces and the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (East Germany), but they had a known intelligence-gathering secondary mission and an important role to verify that offensive action was not being prepared. Reciprocal groups were authorized and operated by both the British, French and U.S. (in East Germany) and the Soviet Union (in West Germany) during the Cold War. Nicholson is officially regarded by the U.S. Department of Defense as having been a victim of murder and the final victim of the Cold War. Nicholson's death led to a U.S. - Soviet crisis and intense negotiations regarding the Military Liaison Missions. Career as intelligence officer Nicholson was the son of a career navy officer. He graduated from Joel Barlow High School of Redding, Connecticut in 1965 and earned a bachelor's degree from Transylvania University in 1969 before joining the U.S. Army in 1970. Nicholson was commissioned as a Military Intelligence (MI) officer and served as a Battalion S-2 (officer in charge of the staff section responsible for intelligence products and analysis) with a missile battalion in Korea during 1973-74. From 1974-79, he served with MI units in Frankfurt am Main and Munich in the Federal Republic of Germany. Following this, Nicholson became a Foreign Area Officer. In 1980, he earned a master's degree in Soviet and East European Studies from the Naval Postgraduate School and also attended a two-year course in the Russian language at the Defense Language Institute. From 1980-82, Nicholson attended the U.S. Army's Russian Institute in Garmisch- Partenkirchen, Germany. In 1982, Nicholson was assigned to the U.S. Military Liaison Mission (USMLM) to the Commander-in-Chief of the Group of Soviet Forces Germany. He was promoted to major in 1983. Death Major Nicholson's casket being placed on a U.S. aircraft at Rhein-Main Air Base in Germany Grave at Arlington Cemetery Memorial near Ludwigslust, Germany On March 24, 1985, with Sergeant Jessie G. Schatz, Nicholson undertook his final mission for the USMLM. The mission was to photograph a Soviet tank storage building near Ludwigslust, some 100 miles northwest of Berlin. After approaching the Soviet facility covertly but legitimately through an adjacent forest, Nicholson stepped out of the vehicle and approached the building to photograph it while Sergeant Schatz maintained a watch for Soviet personnel. Unseen by either man, Soviet Sergeant Aleksandr Ryabtsev emerged from the forest and opened fire on the Americans. The first bullet narrowly missed Schatz, and another bullet struck Nicholson. After crying out that he had been hit, Nicholson fell to the ground. Attempting to go to Nicholson's aid, Schatz was halted by Ryabtsev at gunpoint and forced back into the USMLM vehicle. Although the Soviets later claimed that Nicholson died instantly, an autopsy indicated that he had actually bled to death while on the ground. Even as more senior Soviet personnel arrived, no medical aid for Nicholson was provided and no one checked his conditions for two hours after he was shot. After an attempt by the Soviets to perform an autopsy of Nicholson and a demand by General Glenn K. Otis that they return the body, Nicholson's body was returned to the U.S. Army at the Glienicke Bridge in Berlin. On March 30, 1985, Nicholson was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.Nicholson funeral He was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and the Legion of Merit as well as promoted to lieutenant colonel. The Soviets contended that the response of Sergeant Ryabtsev, as a guard, had been appropriate in confronting an \\"unknown intruder who did not comply with the warnings of the sentry,\\"Statement by Larry M. Speakes on 23 April 1985 and also stated that the area that Major Nicholson was in was \\"off-limits\\" to military liaison mission operations, as well as placing blame for the incident on the United States. Aftermath At a subsequent meeting between General Otis and General Mikhail Zaitsev, the commander of Group of Soviet Forces Germany, General Otis made it clear that the U.S. Army believed that Nicholson's murder \\"[was] officially condoned, if not directly ordered.\\" Following this, a Soviet diplomat was ordered out of the U.S. and the U.S. canceled plans to jointly celebrate the 40th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe with the Soviets. The incident was also the first major foreign policy crisis faced by Mikhail Gorbachev as leader of the Soviet Union. The relatively muted U.S. response drew criticism from various sources, among them George Will. Further negotiations over the shooting resulted in the Soviets issuing instructions to their personnel that the use of force or weapons against Allied military liaison personnel was strictly forbidden. However, in 1987, another incident took place in which Soviet soldiers fired at USMLM personnel, one of whom was wounded. In 1988, Soviet Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov officially apologized for the death of Major Nicholson to U.S. Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci at a summit conference in Moscow.

He is best remembered for his work at the Knopf publishing house, where he edited B. Traven, Raymond Chandler, and Dashiell Hammett, and Langston Hughes. Early life Bernard Smith was born on September 20, 1907 in New York City. His father was a businessman and his mother was a housewife. He attended City University of New York.

Andriukaitis' family was deported to Siberia in June 1941. He, his mother and two older brothers were allowed to return to Lithuania in 1958; his father returned in 1959. After excelling at school, he enrolled at Kaunas Medical Institute, graduating in 1975. In 1976 Andriukaitis started his career in politics as a member of the underground Social Democrat movement, but later continued his studies by pursuing a degree in history at Vilnius University, graduating in 1984. Andriukaitis was elected to the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania, which preceded Seimas (Lithuanian Parliament), in 1990. Andriukaitis was a member of the Lithuanian Parliament for six terms, from 1992 to 2004 and from 2008 to 2012, and was a deputy chairman of its council from 2001 to 2004. He was a health minister of the Republic of Lithuania since December 2012 until the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker appointed him to serve as an EU Commissioner in November 2014. After the term as European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Andriukaitis became WHO Special Envoy for the European region in March 2020. Early life Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis was born in Kyusyur, Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, USSR. His father, Alfonsas Andriukaitis and mother Liuda Andriukaitienƒó, pregnant at the time, together with two small children were deported from Lithuania to Siberia by Soviet Communists in June 1941. While there, they only had access to Russian literature; Andriukaitis learned Lithuanian from his mother, who would write down Lithuanian fairy tales, which he would later read. In 1954, the family received a permission to relocate to Olyokminsk in continental USSR. In 1957, they were allowed to return to Lithuania after his mother was awarded a medal of honour for raising five children. The family moved to Kaunas, Lithuania ‚Äì he, his mother and two brothers, Antanas and Petras, joined later by their father Alfonsas in 1959. His older brothers were serving in the USSR Army ‚Äì ≈†ar≈´nas in Kaliningrad and Remigijus in Vladivostok. Andriukaitis excelled at school and was awarded a \\"Gold medal\\" upon his graduation from Kaunas Middle School in 1969. It was uncommon to be awarded a medal of achievement without being a member of the \\"komjaunuoliai\\" (Young Communists). Right after graduation, he enrolled at Kaunas Medicine Institute graduating in 1975. He continued his studies, pursuing a degree in history at Vilnius University, graduating in 1984. He did not join the Communist party during his university years and was instead a member of the underground Social Democratic movement for independent Lithuania.  Medical career  In 1975 Andriukaitis started his medical internship at Kaunas 3rd Hospital. Following the internship, he was denied the right to choose the hospital for residency by security services due to his anti-communist political involvement. He was offered to go to Ignalina, in north-east part of the country, where Andriukaitis spent eight years at Ignalina Central Hospital. He was under continuous pressure and scrutiny from the government, due to his involvement in underground political resistance movement. Whilst in Ignalina, in 1979 he qualified in general surgery at Vilnius University; in 1980 he qualified in war surgery at Riga Military Hospital, in 1982 in abdominal surgery and in 1983 in trauma and orthopaedics surgery both at Vilnius University. After being promoted to surgeon (second category) in 1983, and due to a great demand for cardio-surgeons in Vilnius, Andriukaitis was able to relocate there from Ignalina and was appointed a cardiac surgeon at the Cardiac Surgery Centre at the Republican Clinical hospital in Vilnius, Lithuania. In 1987 he qualified in heart and vascular surgery at Moscow Bakulev Cardiovascular Institute and in the same year he took part in the first heart transplantation in the history of Lithuanian medicine. In 1989 Andriukaitis was appointed a cardiovascular surgeon (first category) and became a member of the Lithuanian Physicians' Association (until 1996) and Lithuanian Cardiologists' Association. He was also a member of International Physicians' Association during 1998‚Äì2004. Andriukaitis practiced medicine until 1993, when the new Constitution of Lithuania forbade Members of Parliament to take part in other non-parliamentary activities.  Political career  =Under Soviet rule= Andriukaitis was an active participant in the anti-Soviet underground movement. In 1976 Andriukaitis started his career in politics as a member of the underground Social Democratic movement, participating in their many activities. He was a founder of the University of Antanas Strazdelis, an underground \\"university\\", where members of the resistance movement studied works of the prohibited authors, exchanged books from personal libraries and practiced a humanist way of life (1975‚Äì1982). The \\"university\\" rejected dictatorship, nazism, fascism, autocratic regimes or nationalism and united students by promoting values of democracy, pluralism, multi-party politics, freedom of ideas, philosophy and religion and diversity. In 1976 Andriukaitis was arrested and questioned by the KGB, and forced by the Soviet government to not leave Ignalina for three years, where he was under supervision by the local KGB office. During 1988‚Äì1989 Andriukaitis actively supported the restoration of the LSDP (Social Democratic Party of Lithuania). As a deputy chairman of LSDP, he pioneered the re-establishment of its steering group, was also a member of the Lithuanian Reform Movement SƒÖj≈´dis and participated in the preparation and legalisation of LSDP Lithuanian Movement programmes for elections to the Lithuanian SSR Supreme Council. During this period he was also a member of the working group for the development of the strategy for LSSR self-sufficiency (in regards to social security, health care reform and public administration). =After Soviet rule= In 1990 Andriukaitis was elected a Supreme Soviet Deputy for Lithuanian Republic, a chair he held until 1992.

In 1990 he became a delegation member in the Baltic Assembly at the Parliament of the Republic of Lithuania, the position he held until 2004. Andriukaitis was also one of the co-authors of the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania, which was adopted in 1992. =Member of Parliament= In 1992, Andriukaitis became a Member of Parliament of the Republic of Lithuania, a vice-chairman of Health and Social Affairs Committee, the deputy chair (seni≈´nas) of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party Parliamentary Group, and a member of the National Security Concept Development Working Group. In 1996, he was re-elected as a Member of Parliament where he was renamed a member of the Conference of Chairs of Parliamentary Groups and of the State and Local Government Committee, Polish Parliamentary Assembly and as a chair of LSDP Parliamentary Group. Andriukaitis was a candidate for the president of the Republic of Lithuania in 1997, and also in 2002. In 1999 Andriukaitis was elected an LSDP chairman, serving two years. In 2000, Andriukaitis was elected for his third term as a Member of Parliament of Lithuania and continued as a member of the Conference of Chairs of Parliamentary Groups and also joined Parliamentary Council. In October 2000, he was an Opposition Leader in the Parliament. In 2001 he became a deputy chairman of the Parliament, responsible for the coordination of parliamentary committees as well as the European Integration program, including the planning and management of human and financial resources, a chairman of the European Affairs Committee, a member of Foreign Affairs Committee and Legal Affairs, NATO Commission, and later a replacement member on the Commission on the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania. In 2002, Andriukaitis founded Lithuanian Forum for the Future. He also became a member of Convention on the Future of Europe and leader of the Lithuanian delegation. After some allegations of corruption, on 28 July 2004 Andriukaitis voluntarily resigned from his parliamentary seat, even though the Parliament had earlier refused to revoke his parliamentary immunity, stating that any allegations were unjustified. He decided to not hinder the law enforcement authorities in carrying out an investigation in order to clear his name. Lithuanian Prosecutor General's Office terminated the pre-trial investigation once the accusation proved to be an unfounded smear. On 6 September 2005 Andriukaitis won the legal proceedings against the former Prosecutor General of the Republic of Lithuania when the latter publicly apologized for his words about the allegations. The case was closed with a settlement agreement. Andriukaitis was elected for his fourth term as an MP in 2008 and was appointed a deputy chairman of the Committee on European Affairs; he remained a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and a vice-chairman of LSDP. In 2012, Andriukaitis was appointed a Lithuanian Minister of Health in the 16th Lithuanian Government. = European politics = In 1994 Andriukaitis became a delegate in the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly for the Lithuanian Parliament, also a Parliamentary Assembly Member of the Council of Europe's Human Rights and Legal Affairs Committee. In 2001, as a deputy chairman of the Lithuanian Parliament, he was responsible for the European Integration Program, including the planning and management of human and financial resources.

Early life and military career Grattan was born in Corinth, Vermont on 1 June 1830. His mother, Sarah Rogers, died when he was only five and his father, Peter Grattan, relocated with his young son, John, and daughter, Mary, to Lisbon, New Hampshire where he worked as a wheelwright. John L. Grattan entered West Point in 1849, but did very poorly in his courses. Out of a class of 63, he finished 51st in French, and 43rd in Engineering, and failing mathematics altogether. Due to this, he was held back for a year. He applied himself the following year, finishing in the top third of his class for that year, only to again fall to the bottom third by his final year. In 1853, he graduated 36th out of a class of 55. Fellow graduates that year were James B. McPherson, Philip Sheridan, John Bell Hood, and John Schofield, all of whom would go on to fame during the American Civil War. Grattan, however, would achieve what fame he did receive due to a mistake during his very first command. Military service on the frontier Initially, Grattan's poor performance at West Point left him without a definite assignment as an officer. For a time he was attached as a Brevet Second Lieutenant to the 6th Infantry. Given the customary three months leave following his graduation, Grattan was to have reported to Company G, 6th Infantry, at Fort Laramie, by October 1, 1853. However he failed to arrive until November 16, 1853. Within his first month, according to recorded reports from Post Surgeon Charles Page, Grattan received a reputation as being brash and boastful, while also giving off the impression that he was proud to serve in the army. The most disturbing trait, according to later accounts given by Page, was that Grattan displayed a disdain and dislike of the American Indians, despite having had no contact with them whatsoever up to that point, save seeing or meeting any who were in or around the post. In July and August, 1854, new settlers moving west were plagued by raids from the Cheyenne, and calling on the army to do something about it. After one mid-August raid, settlers and traders encountered the Cheyenne warriors and pursued them, only to give up the chase before engaging. When Grattan was told this, he ridiculed the pursuers for fearing a confrontation with the Cheyenne. However, fear had little to nothing to do with the pursuers backing away. In reality, the settlers and traders who were pursuing the band of warriors had enough experience to recognize that the Cheyenne seemed to be baiting them into a possible ambush, thus they stopped their pursuit and reported the incident to Fort Laramie. During his ridicule of the men, Grattan stated that with 10 men he could defeat the entire Cheyenne nation. Around this same time, in expectation that treaty annuities were soon to come, elements of the Lakota and Oglala had camped near the fort. Collectively the Sioux villages spread across a three-mile area along the North Platte River. In the Native American camps, seasoned chiefs were struggling to control the more impatient young warriors, who were angered by the sight of their people starving, and over former broken promises by the whites. This would be compounded by the fact that Fort Laramie was at the time under the command of two young inexperienced officers, with one being a brash and totally untested young Second Lieutenant. Tensions build The Indians were starving, and had been hungry for weeks awaiting the arrival of the annuities. By most reports, a Mormon wagon train passing through had lost a straggling and lame cow. With any game being scarce in the area, the Sioux butchered the cow, and feasted on it. On August 18, 1854, the wagon train reached Fort Laramie, where the owner of the cow complained to Lt. Hugh Fleming that his cow had been stolen by the Indians. Reports vary, with the most reliable accounts stating that the owner noticed that the cow was missing, and returned to find that the Indians had butchered it. Lt. Fleming sent for Conquering Bear, the leader of the band where the cow had been butchered. Although Conquering Bear did not agree with all of the details in the Treaty of 1851, he did understand quite clearly that restitution was required for any property stolen from white settlers. However, Conquering Bear also knew full well that, by the terms of the treaty, this was not a military matter, a fact that Lt. Fleming was not aware of. In reality, a matter of this sort should have been handled by John Whitfield, the Indian Agent assigned to the area, who was due to arrive within the week. Lt. Fleming wanted the brave who had initially killed the cow, High Forehead, arrested and delivered to the fort. By later Indian accounts, Conquering Bear entered the fort feeling confident that it was a minor affair and would be settled easily enough. However, as negotiations went on, it was quickly evident that Lt. Fleming's inexperience led to him being easily swayed and influenced, in this case by the civilians involved. Conquering Bear offered the owner the choice of any of his 60 horses, but the owner refused. The owner of the cow instead wanted $25 in cash (equivalent to $ in ). By this time, Lt. Grattan had joined the negotiations, and immediately taken the side of the cow owner. Finding himself encouraged by Lt. Grattan's support, the formerly uncertain Lt. Fleming now demanded that High Forehead be arrested and brought to the fort. Alarmed, Conquering Bear attempted to explain that he had no authority over High Forehead, who was of another tribe and who was a guest in his village, therefore making it impossible by his tribe's traditions to arrest him. Conquering Bear left the fort, riding back to the village. He had offered to show the soldiers the lodge of High Forehead, but insisted that he nor any of his people would assist in his arrest. Lt. Fleming was known to the Sioux, and had previously led an attack on a village, with minor casualties, but nonetheless enough to give Lt. Fleming confidence in dealing with the Indians. Lt. Fleming led a detail into the village, but getting the feeling that an arrest would most certainly result in violence, Fleming initially made a solid decision, that being to await the arrival of the Indian Agent, John Whitfield. However, Lt. Grattan pressed Fleming when the latter returned to the fort, pushing him to allow Grattan to lead a force into the Indian village to arrest High Forehead. The next morning, Lt. Grattan was authorized by Lt. Fleming to depart with a force of 22 troopers. Another poor decision on the part of Fleming, as the entire post was made up of only 75 soldiers, and that day 32 were away on wood and hay cutting details. Thus, once Lt. Grattan left the fort, Fleming was left with only a small number of soldiers. To make matters worse, Lt. Grattan took 29 troopers, 7 more than Fleming had authorized, in addition to two artillery pieces. Sergeant Leodegar Schnyder, would later say he did not volunteer due to his belief that the two inexperienced officers were making bad decisions, and thus, not being ordered to go, he did not. Most of the soldiers accompanying Lt. Grattan were experienced soldiers. However, as their translator the detachment had Luciene Auguste, who spoke the Dakota language poorly, and who was despised by the Sioux. Lt. Grattan, having no prior experience with the Indians whatsoever, was now leading his small force into a major Sioux encampment which was filled with young warriors tired of what they considered to be lies told by the white government. Grattan Battle Auguste was drinking heavily while en route to the encampment, and Lt. Grattan either did not notice or ignored this. By the time the party reached the encampment, Auguste was completely intoxicated. Lt. Grattan did notice this intoxication after their arrival, angrily taking Auguste's bottle and smashing it against his saddle. Had he ordered Auguste back to the fort at that point, it might possibly have altered the events that followed. For the first time Lt. Grattan saw the size of the village into which he had led his men. The village was made up of some 600 Sioux lodges, with a population of some 4,800 people, of which approximately 1,200 were warriors. By this point, some of the more experienced soldiers were voicing quietly that their small force was not in a good position, and leaving would be advisable. Halfway into the village, now seeing painted warriors who were openly hostile and riding aggressively around the column, Lt. Grattan stopped, and asked the advice of James Bordeau, an experienced trader who had lived on the frontier for many years. Bordeau had been at Fort Laramie when the earlier incident happened with Conquering Bear, and was in the village trading when the army column entered. He was not aware that the army intended on arresting High Forehead. Bordeau would later state that Auguste, the translator, was openly intoxicated and yelling to the Indians that the army had come to kill them all. Lt. Grattan spoke with Bordeau and asked how this matter could more easily be solved without bloodshed, to which Bordeau responded that Grattan should speak again with Conquering Bear, and let him handle the matter in his own time. At this point Auguste was calling the Sioux warriors women, and was riding wildly around on his horse saying they had come to fight, not to talk. Lt. Grattan led his force deeper into the village, and located High Forehead, who upon being ordered to surrender High Forehead dared Lt. Grattan to come fight him man to man, and that he would die rather than surrender. This annoyed Grattan greatly, who now turned to negotiating with Conquering Bear. The Indian leader requested that Lt. Grattan have soldiers go and retrieve James Bordeau to translate, as Auguste would not translate correctly, and, he was intoxicated. One of the Indian leaders, Man-Afraid-Of-His-Horse, went and retrieved Bordeau. However, before Bordeau arrived the tension between Lt. Grattan and Conquering Bear had increased. Bordeau quickly realized before he reached the meeting spot that violence was obviously not going to be avoided, and he turned back. At some point, Lt. Grattan ordered his two artillery pieces turned to point at the village. Immediately hundreds of warriors surrounded the soldiers. An up-and-coming young warrior at the time, Red Cloud led a group of warriors around to flank the soldiers. Bordeau again decided to go and see what he could do to halt any violence. However, when he reached about twenty five yards distance from the meeting spot, he observed the flanking movements of the Indians, and could hear the heated exchange between Lt. Grattan and Conquering Bear, he again retreated. Bordeau returned to his trading post, where he told all traders inside to load their weapons, as a fight was coming. Lt. Grattan concluded his meeting, and was apparently intending on departing, as Conquering Bear turned and walked toward his lodge. However, before Lt. Grattan reached his detachment, a nervous soldier fired into some approaching warriors, wounding one man. Grattan initially moved to his artillery, however his gun crews were the first to fall, being hit by a volley of arrows. Lt. Grattan died near to the artillery. His force, now down to 18 men, banded together and attempted to reach a rocky area where they could make a stand. However, they had to cross an open prairie before reaching that point, and encountered Red Cloud's warriors in between. The remainder of Grattan's force was quickly overwhelmed and annihilated.

The name is from its most original cultivation center which is even today, at the French Island of Corsica or Corse. It is said to be one of the first citrus fruit to reach the Corsican soil. History, production and uses Traditionally, it was one of the most important varieties employed in Succade production. The fruit used to be shipped to Genoa, Italy, where it was de-pulped in the large centers in Livorno, hence its name the Citron of Commerce. With 45,000 tons per year, Corsica was once the world‚Äôs leading producer of citron. The historian Laurence Pinelli explains: =Etrog= For a short period of time Genoese merchants, who always supplied fruit for the Jewish ritual of Etrog, used to ship also some amount of this Corsican variety, while there was not enough available from Diamante. This tradition terminated due to competition with the Greek citron which was considered to be of extraordinary beauty.The Saga of Citron Today, the citron is cooked with sugar to produce a jam. Description Corsican citrons on the tree This slow-growing tree reaches a height of about 3 to 4 meters, open and spreading, rather small according to different varieties. Medium-thorny with some large, stout spines. The incredibly fragrant blossom appears in March‚ÄìApril and lasts until September, producing good honey with honey bees. Flowers, buds and new growth are not purple-tinted. The tree produces large fruit, ellipsoid to very slightly obovate; basal area slightly depressed and radially furrowed; apical nipple suppressed or indistinct. Color lemon-yellow when ripe. Rind very thick and fleshy, sweet with some bitter after-taste; surface rather rough, bumpy, and commonly somewhat ribbed. Flesh crisp and solid; lacking in juice; flavor sweet without acid. Seeds white yellowish. This giant citron can measure up to 25 cm in length and weigh up to 4 kg.  References  External links * Citrons and their hybrids U.C.

It was first published in the October 1918 issue of The Cosmopolitan, two years after London's death. The story was reprinted in the same year by MacMillan, in a collection of London's stories of the same name. Overview The story is told from the perspective of a scientist called Bassett, who is on an expedition in the jungle of Guadalcanal to collect butterflies. The \\"Red One\\" of the title refers to a giant red sphere, of apparently extraterrestrial origin, that the headhunting natives worship as their god and to which they perform human sacrifices. Bassett becomes obsessed with the Red One and in the end is sacrificed himself. The story's theme was suggested to London by his friend George Sterling: a message is sent from an alien civilization but is lost in the wilderness. There are parallels to Joseph Conrad's short novel Heart of Darkness. Critics have noted the possible influence of Carl Jung on the story, as London became aware of Jung's ideas at around the time of writing \\"The Red One\\" in 1916. The story makes an enigmatic reference to helmeted figures, perhaps the Red One's alien crew. Here, London may have anticipated the ancient astronauts of science fiction and pseudoscience. The U.S. copyright on \\"The Red One\\" has expired, and the story is available on Project Gutenberg.

Life  She was the maternal granddaughter of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor and Anna of Bohemia and Hungary, and sister of John William, Duke of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg. Marie and her mother While her father was a Reform Catholic, Marie Eleonore, who was of a strong willed character, displayed firm Lutheran sympathies early on. Her father was afraid that she would influence her younger sisters with her religious views, and therefore wished to have her married to someone of her own religious convictions as soon as possible in order to remove her from his domains, and thus considered grooms for his daughter that he would not otherwise have considered.R.

In 1577, her mentally ill spouse was placed under the regency of his cousin George Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, which made the position of Marie Eleonore more difficult at the Ducal court of K√∂ningsberg.R.

Lithuania‚ÄìRussia relations refers to bilateral foreign relations between Lithuania and Russia. Lithuania has an embassy in Moscow and consulates in Saint Petersburg, Kaliningrad and Sovetsk. Russia has an embassy in Vilnius, with consulates in Klaipƒóda. The two countries share a common border through Kaliningrad Oblast. History =Lithuania and the Russian Empire= In 1795, Vilna Governorate (consisting of eleven s or districts) and Slonim Governorate, were established by the Russian Empire after the third partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Just a year later, on December 12, 1796, by order of Tsar Paul I they were merged into one governorate, called the Lithuanian Governorate, with its capital in Vilnius. By order of Tsar Alexander I on September 9, 1801, the Lithuanian Governorate was split into the Lithuania-Vilnius Governorate and the Lithuania-Grodno Governorate. After 39 years, the word \\"Lithuania\\" was dropped from the two names by Nicholas I. In 1843, another administrative reform took place, creating the Kaunas Governorate (Kovno in Russian) out of seven western districts of the Vilnius Governorate, including all of ≈Ωemaitija. The Vilnius Governorate received three additional districts: Vileyka and Dzisna from the Minsk Governorate and Lida from Grodno Governorate. It was divided to districts of Vilnius, Trakai, Disna, Oshmyany, Lida, Vileyka and Sventiany. This arrangement remained unchanged until World War I. A part of the Vilnius Governorate was then included in the Lithuania District of Ober-Ost, formed by the occupying German Empire. During the Polish-Soviet War, the area was annexed by Poland. The Council of Ambassadors and the international community (with the exception of Lithuania) recognized Polish sovereignty over Vilnus region in 1923.Jan Tomasz Gross. Revolution from Abroad: The Soviet Conquest of Poland's Western Ukraine and Western Belorussia. Princeton University Press. 2002. p. 3. In 1923, the Wilno Voivodeship was created, which existed until 1939, when the Soviet Union occupied Lithuania and Poland and returned most of the Polish-annexed land to Lithuania. During the 1905 Russian Revolution, a large congress of Lithuanian representatives in Vilnius known as the Great Seimas of Vilnius demanded provincial autonomy for Lithuania (by which they meant the northwestern portion of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania)Snyder (2003), p. 53 on 5 December of that year. The tsarist regime made a number of concessions as the result of the 1905 uprising. The Baltic states once again were permitted to use their native languages in schooling and public discourse, and Catholic churches were built in Lithuania. Latin characters replaced the Cyrillic alphabet that had been forced upon Lithuanians for four decades. But not even Russian liberals were prepared to concede autonomy similar to that that had already existed in Estonia and Latvia, albeit under Baltic German hegemony. Many Baltic Germans looked toward aligning the Baltics (Lithuania and Courland in particular) with Germany.Hiden, John and Salmon, Patrick. The Baltic Nations and Europe. London: Longman. 1994. After the outbreak of hostilities in World War I, Germany occupied Lithuania and Courland in 1915. Vilnius fell to the Germans on 19 September 1915. An alliance with Germany in opposition to both tsarist Russia and Lithuanian nationalism became for the Baltic Germans a real possibility. Lithuania was incorporated into Ober Ost under a German government of occupation. As open annexation could result in a public- relations backlash, the Germans planned to form a network of formally independent states that would in fact be dependent on Germany. =Lithuania and Soviet Russia= As the combined result of the October Revolution and the end of World War I, the power in the territory of Lithuania was contested by several political forces: national, Polish, and Moscow-backed Communist factions. The Council of Lithuania signed the Act of Independence of Lithuania. During the Soviet westward offensive of 1918‚Äì19, which followed the retreating German troops, a Lithuanian‚ÄìSoviet War was fought between the newly independent Lithuania and the Soviet Russia. At the same time period the Soviet Russia had relations with the short-lived Communist puppet states: Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic which was soon merged into the Lithuanian‚ÄìByelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. In April 1920, The Constituent Assembly of Lithuania was elected and first met the following May. In June it adopted the third provisional constitution and on July 12, 1920, signed the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Peace Treaty. In the treaty the Soviet Union recognized fully independent Lithuania and its claims to the disputed Vilnius Region; Lithuania secretly allowed the Soviet forces passage through its territory as they moved against Poland.Snyder (2003), p. 63 On July 14, 1920, the advancing Soviet army captured Vilnius for a second time from Polish forces. The city was returned to Lithuanians on August 26, 1920, following the defeat of the Soviet offensive. The victorious Polish army returned and the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Treaty increased hostilities between Poland and Lithuania. To prevent further fighting, the Suwa≈Çki Agreement was signed with Poland on October 7, 1920; it left Vilnius on the Lithuanian side of the armistice line.Snyder (2003), p. 63-65 It never went into effect, however, because Polish General Lucjan ≈ªeligowski, acting on J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's orders, staged the ≈ªeligowski's Mutiny, a military action presented as a mutiny. He invaded Lithuania on October 8, 1920, captured Vilnius the following day, and established a short-lived Republic of Central Lithuania in eastern Lithuania on October 12, 1920. The \\"Republic\\" was a part of Pi≈Çsudski's federalist scheme, which never materialized due to opposition from both Polish and Lithuanian nationalists. On 30 December 1922, Soviet Russia was incorporated into the Soviet Union, and the latter state inherited the Lithuania‚ÄìRussia relations. =Lithuania and the Soviet Union= 1920s and 1930s The Third Seimas of Lithuania was elected in May 1926. For the first time, the bloc led by the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party lost their majority and went into opposition. It was sharply criticized for signing the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Non-Aggression Pact (even though it affirmed Soviet recognition of Lithuanian claims to Poland-held Vilnius).Snyder (2003), p. 78‚Äì79 World War II At the beginning of World War II, when the Soviet Union invaded Poland, Soviet troops took over Vilnius Region, which belonged to Interwar Poland, but according to the 1920 and 1926 Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian treaties was recognized to Lithuania. As a result, Soviets and Germans re- negotiated the secret protocols of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. On September 28, 1939, they signed the Boundary and Friendship Treaty. Its secret attachment detailed that to compensate the Soviet Union for German-occupied Polish territories, Germany would transfer Lithuania, except for a small territory in Suvalkija, to the Soviet sphere of influence. The exchange of territories was also motivated by Soviet control of Vilnius: the Soviet Union could exert significant influence on the Lithuanian government, which claimed Vilnius to be its de jure capital. In the secret protocols, both Soviet Union and Germany explicitly recognized Lithuanian interest in Vilnius. Accordingly, by the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty of October 10, 1939, Lithuania would acquire about one fifth of the Vilnius Region, including Lithuania's historical capital, Vilnius, and in exchange would allow five Soviet military bases with 20,000 troops to be established across Lithuania. After months of intense propaganda and diplomatic pressure, the Soviets issued an ultimatum on June 14, 1940 Soviets accused Lithuania of violating the treaty and abducting Russian soldiers from their bases. Soviets demanded that a new government, which would comply with the Mutual Assistance Treaty, would be formed and that an unspecified number of Soviet troops would be admitted to Lithuania. With Soviet troops already in the country, it was impossible to mount military resistance. Soviets took control of government institutions, installed a new pro-Soviet government, and announced elections to the People's Seimas. Proclaimed Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic was incorporated into the Soviet Union on August 3, 1940. One local Communist party emerged from underground with 1500 members in Lithuania. Soviet deportations from Lithuania During the occupation of Lithuania, at least 130,000 people, 70% of them women and children,Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 302 were forcibly transported to labor camps and other forced settlements in remote parts of the Soviet Union, such as the Irkutsk Oblast and Krasnoyarsk Krai. Among the deportees were about 4,500 Poles.Stravinskienƒó (2012), p. 44 These deportations did not include Lithuanian partisans or political prisoners (approximately 150,000 people) deported to Gulag forced labor camps.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 289 Deportations of the civilians served a double purpose: repressing resistance to Sovietization policies in Lithuania and providing free labor in sparsely inhabited areas of the Soviet Union. Approximately 28,000 of Lithuanian deportees died in exile due to poor living conditions. Second Soviet occupation Flag of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1953‚Äì1988) Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1954‚Äì1991) In the summer of 1944, the Soviet Red Army reached eastern Lithuania.Snyder (2003), p. 72 By July 1944, the area around Vilnius came under control of the Polish Resistance fighters of the Armia Krajowa, who also attempted a takeover of the German-held city during the ill-fated Operation Ostra Brama.Snyder (2003), p. 88 The Red Army captured Vilnius with Polish help on 13 July. The Soviet Union re-occupied Lithuania and Joseph Stalin re-established the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1944 with its capital in Vilnius. The Soviets secured the passive agreement of the United States and Great Britain (see Yalta Conference and Potsdam Agreement) to this annexation. By January 1945, the Soviet forces captured Klaipƒóda on the Baltic coast. The heaviest physical losses in Lithuania during World War II were suffered in 1944‚Äì45, when the Red Army pushed out the Nazi invaders.Saulius Su≈æiedelis, Zag≈Çada ≈ªyd√≥w, piek≈Ço Litwin√≥w [Extermination of the Jews, hell for the Lithuanians]. Zag≈Çada ≈ªyd√≥w, piek≈Ço Litwin√≥w Gazeta Wyborcza wyborcza.pl 28.11.2013 It is estimated that Lithuania lost 780,000 people between 1940 and 1954 under the Nazi and Soviet occupations.Lithuania profile: history. U.S. Department of State Background Notes. Last accessed on 02 June 2013 After Stalin's death in 1953, the deportees were slowly and gradually released. The last deportees were released only in 1963. Some 60,000 managed to return to Lithuania, while 30,000 were prohibited from settling back in their homeland. Soviet authorities encouraged the immigration of non-Lithuanian workers, especially Russians, as a way of integrating Lithuania into the Soviet Union and encouraging industrial development, but in Lithuania this process did not assume the massive scale experienced by other European Soviet republics.Snyder (2003), p. 94 To a great extent, Lithuanization rather than Russification took place in postwar Vilnius and elements of a national revival characterize the period of Lithuania's existence as a Soviet republic. Lithuania's boundaries and political integrity were determined by Joseph Stalin's decision to grant Vilnius to the Lithuanian SSR again in 1944. Subsequently, most Poles were resettled from Vilnius (but only a minority from the countryside and other parts of the Lithuanian SSR) by the implementation of Soviet and Lithuanian communist policies that mandated their partial replacement by Russian immigrants. Vilnius was then increasingly settled by Lithuanians and assimilated by Lithuanian culture, which fulfilled, albeit under the oppressive and limiting conditions of the Soviet rule, the long-held dream of Lithuanian nationalists.Snyder (2003), pp. 91‚Äì93 The economy of Lithuania did well in comparison with other regions of the Soviet Union. In 1956 and 1957, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union approved releases of larger groups of the deportees, including the Lithuanians. Deportees started returning in large numbers creating difficulties for local communists ‚Äì deportees would petition for return of their confiscated property, were generally considered unreliable and required special surveillance. Soviet Lithuanian officials, including Antanas Snieƒçkus, drafted local administrative measures prohibiting deportee return and petitioned Moscow to enact national policies to that effect.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 415 In May 1958, the Soviet Union revised its policy regarding the remaining deportees: all those who were not involved with the Lithuanian partisans were released, but without the right to return to Lithuania.Anu≈°auskas (1996), p. 396 The last Lithuanians‚Äîthe partisan relatives and the partisans‚Äîwere released only in 1960 and 1963 respectively.Anu≈°auskas (2005), pp. 417‚Äì418 Majority of the deportees released in May 1958 and later never returned to Lithuania.Anu≈°auskas (1996), pp. 397‚Äì398 About 60,000 deportees returned to Lithuania.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 418 Upon return, they faced further difficulties: their property was long looted and divided up by strangers, they faced discrimination for jobs and social guarantees, their children were denied higher education. Former deportees, resistance members, and their children were not allowed to integrate into the society. That created a permanent group of people that opposed the regime and continued non-violent resistance.Vardys (1997), p. 84 Because of the United States and the United Kingdom, the allies of the Soviet Union were against Nazi Germany during World War II, recognized the occupation of the Republic of Lithuania at Yalta Conference in 1945 de facto, the governments of the rest of the western democracies did not recognize the seizure of Lithuania by the Soviet Union in 1940 and in 1944 de jure according to the Sumner Welles' declaration of 23 July 1940;Daniel Fried, Assistant Secretary of State at U.S Department of State Due to the situation, many western countries continue to recognize Lithuania as an independent, sovereign de jure state subject to international law represented by the legations appointed by the pre-1940 Baltic states which functioned in various places through the Lithuanian Diplomatic Service. Lithuania declared sovereignty on its territory on 18 May 1989 and declared independence from the Soviet Union on 11 March 1990 as the Republic of Lithuania, and was the first Soviet republic to do so. All legal ties of the Soviet Union's sovereignty over the republic were cut as Lithuania declared the restitution of its independence. The Soviet Union claimed that this declaration was illegal, as Lithuania had to follow the process of secession mandated in the Soviet Constitution if it wanted to leave. Most other countries followed suit after the failed coup in August, with the State Council of the Soviet Union recognized Lithuania's independence on 6 September 1991. =Lithuania and the Russian Federation= On 27 July 1991, the Russian government re-recognized Lithuania and the two countries re-established diplomatic relations on 9 October 1991. President Boris Yeltsin and President Vytautas Landsbergis met to discuss economic ties. The Russian troops stayed in Lithuania for an additional three years, as Boris Yeltsin linked the issue of Russian minorities with troop withdrawals. Lithuania was the first to have the Russian troops withdrawn from its territory in August 1993. Since the reestablishment of independence, Lithuanian leaders have only visited Moscow twice: one by Algirdas Brazauskas in 1997 and Valdas Adamkus in 2001 and 2005. A planned 1999 trip to Moscow was reportedly canceled due to Boris Yeltsin's illness. The first telephone conversation took place between Dalia Grybauskaitƒó and Dmitry Medvedev in 2009. Following Russia's military intervention in Ukraine, concerns about the geopolitical environment led Lithuania to begin preparing for a Russian invasion. In December 2014, Russia carried out a military drill in nearby Kaliningrad with 55 naval vessels and 9000 soldiers. In 2015, Lithuanian Chief of Defence Jonas Vytautas ≈Ωukas announced plans to reinstate conscription, which ended in 2008, to bolster the ranks of the Lithuanian Armed Forces. The Ministry of National Defence also published a 98-page manual for citizens to prepare them for armed conflict and occupation.

The temple was built in the early 9th century in the village of Kodandaramapuram, which later became part of Avanam Paruthiyur, situated on the banks of the Kudamurutti River, a tributary of the Kaveri. The presiding deity of this temple is a form of Shiva called Vishahareswarar, and his consort Prasanna Parvathy Devi. The temple today is an ancient heritage symbol of the village. The temple was one of the 108 Shiva temples built by Cholan Aditya Varman 1, on the banks of the Kaveri. Mythology Once Rahu approached with his mouth agape to eclipse the Sun, he became very angry when he saw the burning rays of the Sun. He began to emit poisonous breath in his serpent form, blackening the face of the Sun. Having lost his glorious face by Rahu's poisonous breath, the Sun sought the favor of Lord Shiva and worshiped him on the northern banks of the Kudamurutti River, a tributary of the Kaveri, under a Bilwa Tree. First Goddess Parvathy Devi blessed Sun, and then Lord Shiva himself joined her and the divine couple blessed him. Lord Shiva relieved the Sun of the evil effects of Rahus's poison and the Sun regained His charm and brightness. Rahu then felt remorse for his actions and begged Lord Shiva's pardon. The Shiva temple that was built here to commemorate Shiva blessing the Surya. The temple hosts Shiva as Vishahareswarar, which means \\"poison remover\\", along with his consort Prasanna Parvathi Devi. Paruthiyur Vishahareshwarar temple is famous and very auspicious. Festivals The temple is open to the public mornings and evenings. Shivarathri is celebrated in a special way in this temple. Also, it is said that the poison of a snake will be ineffective at this place. Though there are many snakes and cobras in every nook and corner of the village, there has never been a snakebite or poison attack. It is also believed that worshiping Shiva & Parvathy here gets one relieved of the evil effects of Rahu, Kethu and Mars, and also finalizes marriages. Parithi means the Sun. Since it was here where the Sun worshiped Lord Shiva, this holy place got the name Parithipuram. People with poisonous bites and deadly diseases come from distant places and to pray to Vishahareswarar, the poison remover. History This Vishahareswara temple was built by Aditya Chola (C.E. 870-901). The Chola name for the temple was THIRU ADITTECHARAM. The temple was renovated and taken care by a great Shiva Bhakta by the name Paruthiyur Venkatesha Sastri, popularly known as Annaval. Annaval had spent most of his time in this temple with his parayanams of the Shiva Purana, teaching the scriptures, spreading bhakti and promoting Hindu Dharma. He was an authority on Saivite traditions. Annaval addressed several issues by answering the queries on Dharma Sastram and Hindu traditions, often posed to him by Vedic scholars and pundits. His authority on the administration of dharma made many legal luminaries come to them seeking their advice on issues concerning Hindu law. Paruthiyur Venkatesha Sastri Annaval (1770‚Äì1841), along with his brother Paruthiyur Sri Krishna Sastri Ayyaval (1773‚Äì1860), were the doyen brothers of Paruthiyur and for the Hindu Religion. The great exponent of the Ramayana, Philanthropist and Pravachan Pioneer Bramasri Paruthiyur Krishna Sastrigal (1855‚Äì1911), renovated this Vishahareswarar Temple and did Kumbhabhishekam in 1905.

Robinson Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes pg 184 Oxford University Press 1996 Terret blanc is the white mutation of the grape. In official statistics, the plantings of two \\"light-berried\\" Terret grapes (as distinguished from Terret noir, one of the permitted blending grapes for Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape AOC) are often counted together. The varieties reached their peak in French wine productions in the late 1980s when together the Terret varieties were the ninth most widely planted white grape variety. In the Languedoc, plantings of Terret were equal to that of Chardonnay. Wine regions While not as widely planted and used as it once was, Terret gris is still a permitted variety (along with Terret blanc) in some Languedoc AOC but it also can be found in some of the white vin de pays blends from the Languedoc. Terret gris is most widely planted in the Languedoc region. In the late 1980s, when the variety was at its peak usage, there were over 12,300 acres (5,000 hectares) planted in the region (some plantings were likely Terret blanc which is often counted together in official statistics). The grape is a permitted variety in the white AOC wines of Corbi√®res, Coteaux du Languedoc and Minervois, though its use in the Coteaux du Languedoc was rapidly declining at the end of the 20th century. As of 2000, the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualit√© (INAO) reported that there was 3000 hectares of the light skinned Terrets, of which approximately 2,600 ha (6,400 acres) were believed to be the Terret blanc variety in particular.J.

It is a mutation of the Terret vine that also spawned the dark skinned Terret noir and light-skinned Terret gris varieties.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes pg 184 Oxford University Press 1996 In official statistics, the plantings of two \\"light-berried\\" Terret grapes (Blanc and Gris) are often counted together. The varieties reached their peak in French wine productions in the late 1980s when together the Terret varieties were the ninth most widely planted white grape variety. In the Languedoc, plantings of Terret were equal to that of Chardonnay. Wine regions and plantings Terret blanc is grown in the Corbi√®res AOC where it is a permitted variety in the white blend from the region. Terret blanc is a permitted grape variety in several Languedoc AOCs including:P.

He was Master of St. John's College, Cambridge, and a leading divine in the university in the latter half of the sixteenth century. His uncle was Alexander Nowell, the Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral and catechist. Early life and education He was born at Holme, near Burnley, Lancashire, in 1548, being the third son of Thomas Whitaker of that place, by Elizabeth his wife, daughter of John Nowell, esq., of Read, and sister of Alexander Nowell, dean of St Paul's.\\" After receiving the rudiments of learning at his native parish school, he was sent by his uncle, Alexander Nowell, to St Paul's School in London. (Alexander Nowell, a Marian exile, a fugitive from the \\"burning times\\" of Anglo-Italian policies, 1553‚Äì1558, was also a Protestant, Reformed and Anglican Churchman.) Whitaker thence proceeded to Cambridge, where he matriculated as a pensioner of Trinity College on 4 October 1564. He was subsequently elected a scholar on the same foundation, proceeded B.A. in March 1568, and on 6 September 1569 was elected to a minor fellowship, and on 25 March 1571 to a major fellowship, at his college. In 1571 he commenced M.A. Throughout his earlier career at the university he was assisted by his uncle, who granted him leases, \\"freely and without fine,\\" towards defraying his expenses. Whitaker evinced his gratitude by dedicating to Nowell a translation of the Book of Common Prayer into Greek, and a like version of Nowell's own larger catechism from the Latin into Greek.. See Attribution. Academic career The marked ability with which he acquitted himself when presiding as \\"father of the philosophy act\\" at an academic commencement appears to have first brought him prominently into notice. He also became known as an indefatigable student of the scriptures, the commentators, and the schoolmen, and was very early in his career singled out by John Whitgift, at that time master of Trinity, for marks of special favour. On 3 February 1578 he was installed canon of Norwich Cathedral, and in the same year was admitted to the degree of B.D., and incorporated on 14 July at Oxford. In 1580 he was appointed by the crown to the regius professorship of divinity, to which Elizabeth shortly after added the chancellorship of St. Paul's, London, and from this time his position as the champion of the teaching of the Protestant and Reformed Church of England appears to have been definitely taken up. In 1582, on taking part in a disputation at commencement, he took for his thesis, Pontifex Romanus est ille Antichristus, quern futurum Scriptura pr√¶dixit, or, The Roman Pope is that Antichrist which the Scriptures Foretold. His lectures, as professor, afterwards published from shorthand notes taken by John Allenson, a fellow of St. John's, were mainly directed towards refuting Roman Catholic theologians, especially Robert Bellarmine and Thomas Stapleton. He also severely criticised the just-published Douay version of the New Testament, thereby becoming involved in a controversy with William Rainolds. His work, Disputatio de Sacra Scriptura contra hujus temporis papistas, inprimis Robertum Bellarminum, or Disputations on Holy Scripture, remains one of the premier volumes on the doctrine of Scripture, often under- appreciated, little read, but standing like a titan amongst the volumes of the English Reformed Churchman. One of the premier issues that divided and still divides informed Protestants from Roman Catholics is the question of the place of Scripture. Reformed Churchmmen like Whitaker, then like now, declared that the Scriptures alone are the rule of faith and practice whereas Roman Catholics assert co-equal veneration and co-authoritative roles between Scripture, traditions held by the Church and other unwritten issues. This debate is not new. William Whitaker forcefully and brilliantly championed the Protestant, Reformed and Anglican position in 1588. He deals with the number of canonical books, the authority of Scripture, the perspicuity (clarity) of Scripture, the proper interpretation of Scripture, and the perfection of Scripture against unwritten traditions. On 28 February 1586 Whitaker, on the recommendation of Whitgift and Burghley, was appointed by the crown to the mastership of St. John's College. The appointment was, however, opposed by a majority of the fellows on the ground of his supposed leanings towards puritanism. His rule as an administrator justified in almost equal measure the appointment and its objectors. The college increased greatly in numbers and reputation, but the puritan party gained ground considerably in the society. Whitaker was a no less resolute opponent of Lutheranism than of Roman doctrine and ritual. In the discharge of his ordinary duties as master his assiduity and strict impartiality in distributing the rewards at his disposal conciliated even those who demurred to his theological teaching, and Baker declares that the members of the college were \\"all at last united in their affection to their master,\\" and that eventually \\"he had no enemies to overcome.\\" In 1587 he was created D.D.; and in 1593, on the mastership of Trinity College falling vacant by the preferment of Dr. John Still to the bishopric of Bath and Wells, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the post. In the following year he published his De Authoritate Scriptur√¶, written in reply to Stapleton, prefixing to it a dedication to Whitgift (18 April 1594), the latter affording a noteworthy illustration of his personal relations with the primate, and also of the Roman controversialist learning of that time. In May 1595 he was installed canon of Canterbury; but his professorship, mastership, and canonry appear to have left him still poor, and in a letter to Burghley, written about a fortnight before his death, he complains pathetically at being so frequently passed over amid \\"the great preferments of soe many.\\" He may possibly have been suffering from dejection at this time, owing to the disagreement with Whitgift in which, in common with others of the Cambridge heads, he found himself involved in connection with the prosecution of William Barret. In November 1595 he was deputed, along with Humphrey Gower, president of Queens' College, to confer with the primate on the drawing up of the Lambeth Articles. On this occasion he appears to have pressed his Calvinistic views warmly, but without success, and he returned to Cambridge fatigued and disappointed. He fell ill and died on 4 December 1595. In 1900 there were two portraits of Whitaker in the master's lodge at St. John's College (one in the drawing-room, the other in the hall), both bearing the words, \\"Dr. Whitaker, Mr. 1587,\\" and one at the Chetham Hospital and Library at Manchester. His portrait was engraved by William Marshall in Thomas Fuller's Holy State, 1642, and by John Payne. His epitaph, in Latin hexameters on a marble tablet, has been placed on the north wall of the interior of the transept of the college chapel. His hopes of preferment were disappointed, probably because he was twice married, and thus forfeited in some measure the favour of Elizabeth. The maiden name of his first wife, who was sister-in-law to Laurence Chaderton, was Culverwell; his second wife, who survived him, was the widow of Dudley Fenner. He had eight children: one of the sons, Alexander Whitaker, who was educated at Trinity College, afterwards became known as the \\"Apostle of Virginia.\\" Alexander baptised Pocahontas. Another son who set his eyes on America was Jabez. He was one of the first planters in Jamestowne and helped build a guest house to greet new families to Virginia. No English divine of the sixteenth century surpassed Whitaker in the estimation of his contemporaries. Ralph Churton justly styles him \\"the pride and ornament of Cambridge.\\" Bellarmine so much admired his genius and attainments that he had his portrait suspended in his study. Joseph Scaliger, Bishop Hall, and Isaac Casaubon alike speak of him in terms of almost unbounded admiration.

Robinson Jancis Robinson's Wine Course Third Edition pg 128 Abbeville Press 2003 Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 122, 267 Harcourt Books 2001 History Wine historians believe that Tourbat took a similar path as Grenache in spreading from Spain to Roussillon and the island of Sardinia (highlighted) while both were under the Crown of Aragon (14th century territories pictured) The exact origins of Tourbat are unknown, with some ampelographers and wine historian suggesting that it has a similar origins as Grenache and is likely a Spanish variety. Its presence in Roussillon seems to trace to that area's time under the Kingdom of Majorca with James I of Aragon was lord of over a wide expanse of land that crosses the modern-day borders of southern France and northern eastern Spain. Similarly, like Grenache, Tourbat may have spread to Sardinia when the island was under the rule of the Kingdom of Aragon.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes pg 187 Oxford University Press 1996 Plantings of Tourbat greatly declined in the 20th century with Sardinia remaining the one significant source of the variety for a large part of that century. Even there the grape was on the verge of extinction until one producer, Sella & Mosca, began focusing on the variety and propagating healthier cuttings. Their work also lead to a slight resurgence of interest in the Roussillon region in the 1980s when the new cuttings of healthier vines were imported from Sardinia. However, overall the variety is still not widely planted. Wine regions In Sardinia, Tourbat is known as Torbato and is grown around Alghero in the province of Sassari on the northwestern reaches of the island. In France, it is most widely planted in the Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e AOC region of the C√¥tes du Roussillon where the variety is known as Malvoisie du Roussillon. Wine styles Tourbat tends to produce full-bodied wines with distinctive aromas that often include smokey notes.

After graduating from the University of Notre Dame and a stint in the US Marines, he began his career with the Chicago Zephyrs and became their promotions director after their move to Baltimore. He subsequently served as the first general manager of the Indiana Pacers from 1967 to 1969, before assuming the positions of GM and part-owner of the Kentucky Colonels. He became the commissioner of the American Basketball Association (ABA) in 1973, and played an instrumental role in the league's merger with the National Basketball Association (NBA) three years later. Early life Storen was born on September 14, 1935 to Mark Storen and Marion Lois Riley, and grew up in Michigan City, Indiana. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame, where he played defensive back on their football team during his freshman year. He proceeded to serve in the Marine Corps, participating in their Toys for Tots program. Career Storen career in sports management began in the early 1960s, when he successfully applied to become a ticket seller for the NBA's Chicago Zephyrs after seeing their job advertisement in a newspaper. He remained with the team after their move to Baltimore in 1963 and subsequently rose to the position of promotions director.Sports Illustrated Vault articleWildcats website Storen then became the business manager and assistant general manager of the NBA's Cincinnati Royals. Storen became the first vice president and general manager of the Indiana Pacers of the ABA in 1967. He played a key role in selecting the team's name and colors, as well as in creating their first logo. Under Storen's leadership, the Pacers brought in Bobby Leonard as their head coach and future Hall of Famers Roger Brown and Mel Daniels. These moves paid off, as the team's final nine seasons in the ABA saw them win three championships and reach five Finals. In April 1969, Storen and others including ‚Äì future Governor of Kentucky John Y. Brown, Jr. ‚Äì bought the ABA's Kentucky Colonels franchise. Storen became president and general manager of the Colonels. Storen resigned his positions with the Colonels in 1973 as Brown bought out the other investors and assumed more operational involvement than Storen thought appropriate. Storen had a rocky relationship with the Louisville media after firing Colonels head coach Gene Rhodes, a favorite of the local reporters, due to Rhodes' allegedly mediocre performance.Sports Illustrated Vault Rhodes succeeded Storen as general manager of the Colonels in 1973, when Storen became Commissioner of the ABA. Storen became ABA commissioner in 1973. His initiative of having the fledgling league recruit undergraduate college stars like Julius Erving galvanized the drive toward ABA‚ÄìNBA merger in 1976. Storen would leave this position to become an owner of the league's Memphis Sounds franchise with Isaac Hayes and Kemmons Wilson. After the 1974‚Äì75 season, the Sounds were sold and became the Baltimore Claws. Storen became president and general manager of the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA in 1977.

Robinson Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes p. 196 Oxford University Press 1996 Vespaiola grapes ripen to high sugar levels and are used to produce sweet wines with a characteristic golden hue. In fact, the grapes of Vespaiola get so concentrated with sugars that the name Vespaiola comes from Vespa, in reference to wasps that are attracted to the sugary aromas in vineyards.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Wine Course Third Edition p. 129 Abbeville Press 2003 K.

Wine regions A Torcolato dessert style wine from Breganze made from Vespaiola. The Breganze DOC, located in the foothills of the Alps, contains a significant number of plantings of Vespaiola where the grape can be included in the generic Breganze blend or produced in a varietal wine. To be included in the DOC wine, the grapes must be harvested up to a maximum yield 14 tonnes/hectare (13 tonnes for the varietal) with the finished wine fermented to a minimum alcohol level of 11% (11.5% for the varietal).P. Saunders Wine Label Language pp. 124‚Äì216 Firefly Books 2004 For the Breganze white blend, up to 15% Vespaiola is permitted to blended primarily with Friulano with Pinot bianco, Pinot grigio, Riesling Italico and Sauvignon blanc also potentially included in the blend. The varietal wine Vespaiola must be made entirely of the single variety, harvested to more limited yields and produced with a higher alcohol level. A superiore style is also permitted if the wine achieves at least a 12% alcohol level. When Vespaiola is used to produce a dessert style wine from partially dried grapes (a passito) it maybe labeled as Torcolato.M. Ewing- Mulligan & E. McCarthy Italian Wines for Dummies p. 127 Hungry Minds 2001 =DOC regions= The following is a list of DOC wines, beyond Breganze, that include Vespaiola as a permitted grape variety, along with other grapes that may be included in the blend under varying percentages that are regulated under the DOC label. *Bagnolo di Sopra DOC ‚Äì Primarily Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc and Friulano with up to 10% permitted to be Vespaiola and/or other local white grape varieties. *Merlara DOC ‚Äì Primarily Friulano with up to 50% permitted to be Vespaiola and/or other local white grape varieties. *Vicenza DOC ‚Äì Primarily Garganega with up to 50% permitted to be Vespaiola and/or other local white grape varieties. Viticulture and winemaking Vespaiola gets its name from the wasps (vespa) that are attracted to the ripening sugars in the grapes. The name Vespaiola is derived from the Latin vespa and refers to the wasps that are attracted to the high sugar content in the grapes as they ripen late into the growing season.Oz Clarke and M. Rand Encyclopedia of Grapes p. 273 Webster International Publishers The wasps' presence can be considered a viticultural hazard due to not only their propensity to damage the grapes in order to get to the sweet pulp inside, but also the danger they may cause to vineyard workers in the area.V. Hazan Italian Wine p. 212 Random House Publishing, 1982 In vintages where the climate conditions are favorable, the grapes maybe left on the vine to desiccate and further concentrate the sugars well into January. They could also be harvested earlier and left to dry inside special drying rooms where they are may be hung from the ceilings or spread out on mats to dry. Even with the long ripening periods and high sugar concentrations, the Vespaiola grape can still maintain a relatively high level of acidity that can help balance the sweetness in the resulting wines. After fermentation, some producers will age the wines in oak barrels. Wine styles The passito styles of Vespaiola are characterized by a golden color with aromas of apricots, honeysuckles and spice that can be a byproduct of aging in oak. The naturally high acidity of the grapes can help balance the high sugar content producing what wine expert Oz Clarke describes as \\"one of Italy's finest sweet wines.\\" In recent years, producers in Breganze have experimented with producing Sauternes-style wine from Vespaiola, Friulano and other white grapes that have been infected with Botrytis cinerea. While Vespaiola is often used to produce sweet dessert wines, it can also be fermented to dryness where it usually produces a light-bodied wines with high acidity and very little of the aroma notes that tend to characterize the grape's sweeter incarnations. Synonyms Over the years Vespaiola and its wines have been known under various synonyms including Bresparola, Bresparola Bianca, Orisi bianca, Uva Vespera, Vespaia, Vespaiolo, Vespajola, Vespajuola Di Bassano, Vesparola, and Vespera.

The west wing and chapel dedicated to St Lawrence were added in about 1800, and an east wing in the early 19th century, to which was added a ballroom in 1836 possibly to a design by Ignatius Bonomi. A curved porte- coch√®re on the north side, and adjoining vestibule and corridor, were added in 1861-5 by Joseph Hansom. History The Roman Catholic family of Maire acquired the manor of Lartington by marriage in 1654. It passed to the Lawson family when Sir Henry Lawson Bt (d. 1834) of Brough Hall married Anna Anastasia, the Maire heiress. Their grandson Henry Thomas Maire Silvertop, who inherited the estate, married Eliza Witham and changed his surname to Witham. As Henry Witham he was High Sheriff of Durham in 1844. His fourth son Right Reverend Monsignor Thomas Edward Witham lived in the Hall from 1847 until his death in 1897 when the estate passed to his grandnephew Francis Silvertop of Minsteracres, who sold it out of the family in 1911 to architect David Magnus Spence, father of renowned social paedriatrician James Calvert Spence. The house was sold again in 1919. In subsequent years the house was let to Richard Forster Matthews and then to his nephew Frederick Berkley-Matthews. Restoration Norman Field and later his widow owned the house but after her death it stood empty and neglected for some years.

In 1879 there were two tropical storms, four hurricanes, and two major hurricanes (Category 3+). However, in the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated. Of the known 1879 cyclones, Hurricane One were first documented in 1995 by Jose Fernandez-Partagas and Henry Diaz.

Two were tropical storms and six were hurricanes, with winds of 75 mph (119 km/h) or greater. The first storm of the season formed as a tropical storm off the Carolinas on August 9\\\\. It briefly reached Category 1 hurricane strength before dissipating on August 12 off Newfoundland. The second cyclone of the year was a major Category 3 hurricane. Known as The Great Beaufort Hurricane, it caused extensive damage to both North Carolina and Virginia. Hurricane Three made landfalls at both the Yucatan Peninsula and near Galveston, Texas, causing great damage along the Louisiana coast. Hurricane Four was the second Category 3 cyclone of the year and, like Hurricane Three, also struck the Gulf coast. In this case the damage and destruction were centred on Morgan City, Louisiana. Tropical Storm Five existed between October 3 and 7th and dissipated over Louisiana. Tropical Storm Six travelled from east of Barbados to make landfall first on Isla de la Juventud, then Cuba and later Florida. Hurricane Seven began as a tropical storm in the Caribbean Sea, before crossing Florida and travelling north, parallel to the US east coast. The last cyclone of the year was a Category 2 hurricane that developed from a tropical storm as it travelled from close to Hispaniola to a point off Atlantic Canada before dissipating on November 20\\\\.

Its first issue was January 1991. The magazine also has an associated website that covers all things related to classic and historic cars, events, clubs, and related car culture in New Zealand and to a lesser extent Australia. History It was the first magazine to be published after the inception of Parkside Publishing by Gregory and Carolyn Vincent.Parkside MediaCompanies The publication began as a simple idea to put local classic car owners in touch with shows, events, car clubs and trade professionals. The people chosen to write for the magazine, and to highlight the local classic car scene, were passionate about the subject, and were generally classic car owners themselves. It is one of the longest running motoring magazines in New Zealand and is the third biggest selling car magazine behind NZ Performance Car and NZ Autocar. The magazine celebrated its 200th issue in August 2007. Originally in black and white newsprint format the magazine is now glossy and bound. The magazine and its contributors act as a voice for, and stand up for the rights of, people who want to enjoy classic and historic motoring. It has also featured many New Zealand motorsport personalities whose stories would have otherwise been forgotten or ignored, including Ross Jensen, Robbie Francevic, Ron Roycroft, Hec Green, Ralph Watson, Johnny Riley, Ken Smith, Spinner Black, and Howden Ganley. A NZ Classic Car Yearbook is published just before Christmas. Five special issues on New Zealand motorsport and motoring history have also been published. NZ Classic Car's offices are in Grey Lynn, Auckland, New Zealand. Government policy The magazine is one of several that are recognised authorities by the New Zealand Government for defining a classic carFactsheets or special interest vehicleDraft steering systems amendment and is usually mentioned in policy documents relating to transport changes that will affect classic and historic cars by Land Transport New Zealand. Magazine contents A recent issue of NZ Classic Car (Issue 215 ‚Äì November 2008).

Editorial staff The first editor of NZ Classic Car was Greg Vincent, the owner of Parkside Media. He passed editorial responsibility over in about 2000 (issue 101) to Allan Walton who had been with the magazine since its inception. Walton was well known in the classic motoring scene having been involved with classic cars since the early 1980s. Walton co-authored ‚Äì along with acclaimed Christchurch photographer, Terry Marshall ‚Äì Looking Back: The Motorsport Photography of Terry Marshall, a photo-book highlighting New Zealand motorsport from the 1960s to the 1980s. Controversy NZ Classic Car has argued for the continued enjoyment of classic and historic cars by their owners. This has occasionally seen it make submissions to New Zealand government that may not be considered to be the most environmentally friendly options. NZ Classic Car argued to keep leaded petrol,http://www.copeh- mena.org/en/docs/casestudies/New%20Zealand%20Case%20Study.pdf and for exemptions on exhaust emissions for classic cars. Support of Targa in New Zealand NZ Classic Car supported and sponsored Targa New Zealand from the first running in 1995. NZ Classic Car and Targa parted ways after the 2006 event.

Located in the traditional district of Sunnhordland, the island is part of the municipalities of Stord (southern part) and Fitjar (northern part). The largest settlements on the island are the town of Leirvik (granted town status in 1997) and the villages of Sagv√•g and Fitjar. Geography Relief map of the island Stord has an area of and the highest point is the tall mountain Mehammars√•to. The island lies on the northern side of the mouth of the great Hardangerfjorden. The Selbj√∏rnsfjorden lies on the north end of the island. On the east side of the island, the Langenuen strait separates Stord from the neighboring island of Tysnes√∏ya. On the west side of the island, the Stokksundet strait separates Stord from the neighboring island of B√∏mlo. There are over 350 small islands and skerries lying off the northeastern coast. Most of the central part of the island is mountainous, leaving the islands population living mostly along the coasts. The vast majority of the population lives on the southern coastal area near the Hardangerfjorden. The mountains on Stord contain a lot of pyrite. There was a pyrite mine at Litlab√∏ until 1968. At Vikanes, there are marble quarries. Huglo has limestone quarries that have been an important source of extra income since the 1500s. Beyond the lowlands, along a line from Sagv√•g in the southwest to Jektevik in the northeast, rises a mountainous ridge with peaks of over . The highest of which is the tall mountain Mehammars√•to furthest to the north. In this mountainous area, the rock varies from basalt lava, gabbro, and granite. History The area around Fitjar has been settled since the Stone Age. At that time, the sea was higher than today, which means that it went into the present lake Storavatnet and far up Fitjar river. The mild climate of the last ice age meant that much of the area was covered by forest, most probably oak, ash, and lime/linden. The area was rich with wildlife, deer, and wild boar. Archaeologists say there have been people in Fitjar for the last 10,000 years. They have made many discoveries of stone tools around Fitjar. Near the Rimbareid farm, a dwelling under a cairn was discovered by archaeologist E. de Lange in 1906. This residence is probably from the late stone age, but could also be from the early Bronze Age, since residue showed a square house, while the round house was more common in the stone age. The Rimsvarden site dates back tor the Bronze Age. Fitjar mentioned in many of the historical sagas. Harald I had a royal residence at Fitjar, and it was there H√•kon the Good was mortally wounded in the Battle of Fitjar against the sons of Eirik (961). The current coat of arms of Fitjar shows a battle helmet reminiscent of the Battle of Fitjar. During World War II, Stord Island was the location of a British-led commando raid known as \\"Operation Cartoon\\". Industry and business The main industries found on the northern part of the island (other than the municipal government) include engineering and agriculture (including cattle and sheep farming). Fitjar ranks second after Austevoll in Sunnhordland in terms of landed volume of fish, so fishing is a major part of the economy too. In Stord municipality, industry began developing from 1920 until the 1970s. Manufacturing was the main industry with Kv√¶rner and Apply Leirvik as the large enterprises. Both concentrates on offshore oil installations and onshore facilities for oil recovery. Aker Solutions (Aker Stord) built supertankers of up to 370,000 tonnes dv. (until 1975). When the crash of tanker market came, the company went on to build the large production platforms in the North Sea. The year 2000, manufacturing included 63% of the economically active employees within the trade and service industries, while only 1% were related to primary industries. Culture There are two historic churches on the island: Fitjar Church, built in 1867, and Stord Church, built in 1857. Nys√¶ter Church was built in 1992. In Hystadmarkjo, one can see 12 burial mounds, some of them have given rich finds from the Bronze Age. The Sunnhordland Museum in Leirvik has collections in their ten buildings from different places in Sunnhordland. There is also a rich collection of models made by sculptor Torleiv Agdestein from Stord. The Stord Maritime Museum in Leirvik has a rich collection also. Litlab√∏ is the site of a mining museum that shows many interesting remains of the last 100 years of mining. Leirvik also has a great recreational center with a long swimming pool.

It was somewhat effective in clinical trials, but less so than conventional drugs against hypertension (elevated blood pressure). Method of action Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to constrict, and drives blood pressure up. CYT006-AngQb consists of virus-like particles covalently coupled to angiotensin II. Subcutaneous injection causes the immune system to produce antibodies which reduce angiotensin II blood levels, lowering blood pressure. Studies In a 2008 phase IIa study, 72 patients received 100 ¬µg, 300 ¬µg or placebo in weeks 0, 4, and 12. Blood pressure was lowered dose-dependently, by 5.6 mmHg (systolic) and 2.8 mmHg (diastolic) in the 300 ¬µg group. Morning blood pressure (5:00-8:00) was lowered by 25 mmHg (systolic) and 13 mmHg (diastolic). Side effects were mild and included local reactions, headache and fatigue. The 2008 trial was small and exploratory. It did not address the question of whether the vaccine actually protects internal organs, nor did it address safety concerns such as whether the vaccine would cause autoimmune disease. If a standard drug treatment is found to dangerously inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, it can be withdrawn and the effects reversed quickly, but that would not be true of the vaccine. However, poor compliance to standard treatment is the main reason for inadequate control of blood pressure, and if vaccination were safe and effective in the long run, it may solve many compliance problems. CYT006-AngQb did not reach Phase III studies because the antihypertensive effects were small compared to existing ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and they were not reproducible across dosing schemes. Similar vaccines with modified immunogens and different adjuvants are being investigated.

His bronze statuettes are very realistic. Biography Gaston d'Illiers devoted all his life to his two passions: horses and sculpture. He was a very fine rider and showed a deep knowledge of horses. He decided to become a sculptor and took to modelling horses. Jument arabe, Arabian mare (1925) His statues were very appreciated from the start. He showed his productions in specialised exhibitions like \\"salon des artistes fran√ßais\\" from 1899 to his death. He gained quite a reputation among horse experts and art connoisseurs. For example, during his life the statue avant la course (before the race) was often given as a prize to the winner of a horse race or jumping. His private life was quiet. He was a student of the Count de Ruille and was himself a count and thus enjoyed a life of privilege and nobility, spending all his life in the centre of France, in Orl√©ans and Olivet. He often went hunting on horseback with friends in the woods nearby (Orleans forest, Sologne), and some of his works are related to hunting, for example le piqueux, la cur√©e, and retour de chasse. He went twice on trips to Algeria in 1899 and 1910, and these trips gave him inspiration for some works which are still very appreciated: jument arabe, fauconniers, and fantasia. Works Idylle (1923) The works of Gaston d'Illiers, small bronze horses, are fine and elegant works of art. They are particularly appreciated by horse lovers because of their precision and fidelity to nature. Although primarily a sculptor of equine subjects, he did produce at least one model of an Alsatian shepherd dog that appears for sale from time to time. Unlike most of his contemporaries who generally used mid-brown colored patinas, d'Illiers almost exclusively used black patinas. It is rare indeed to find a bronze by d'Illiers in a color other than black. During his life, d'Illiers created around 200 statues. They are all of small size, less than half a meter in each of the 3 dimensions. He modelled them in wax or plaster. The models were then molded to produce a limited number of statues in bronze. Most of the models were damaged during World War II. The manufacturing of the bronze statues is still going on with the remaining models, but on an extremely limited scale. The existing bronze statues are kept by the owners, who seldom sell them. The appearance of a Gaston d'Illiers statue in a sale or a shop is therefore a rare event. The works of d'Illiers show all types of horses including riding horses, driving horses, military horses, and draft horses. Many breeds are represented: Selle Fran√ßais, Anglo-Arabian, Thoroughbred, Cob, Boulonnais, Percheron. When persons are present (rider, driver, groom), they are of little importance whereas the horse remains the centre of attention. Many works are actually portraits of real horses, which accounts for their realism and accuracy. Some are winners of jumping: Idylle, Bulletin rose, Rosette XIV... Others are his own horses or horses belonging to acquaintances: Violette, Jack, Colibri, Esmeralda, Miss, Prince, Dolly, Sydney, sous-off, Lady Hareford, la ruade or poney Coco ruant, cheval aux champs or Coquet au trot, cheval sans terrasse or Sweetheart. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

Stinnes was born in M√ºlheim to the German industrialist and politician Hugo Stinnes. At the age of 24 she participated in her first motor race; by 1927 she had won 17 races and was one of the most successful race car drivers in Europe.

They passed through the Balkans via Beirut, Damascus, Baghdad and Tehran to Moscow, where the two mechanics left, then they travelled to Siberia, crossed the frozen Lake Baikal and the Gobi desert and came to Peking. They travelled by ferry to Japan, later to Hawaii and South America. Arriving in Lima they traveled across the Andes Mountains to Buenos Aires, then back again and north through Central America. The pair continued on to Vancouver and New York. In Washington, D.C. Stinnes and S√∂derstr√∂m were welcomed by President Herbert Hoover.

She is known for her work in video projection, photography, and spatial installations. She has worked in landscaping, design, and writing. \\"I always look for experimental processes. I like the fact that at the beginning I don't know how to do things and then, slowly, I start learning. Often exhibitions don't give me this learning possibility anymore.\\" Biography Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster was born in Strasbourg, France in 1965. At the age of 17, she worked as a museum guard in Grenoble while studying at the √âcole du Magasin of the National Centre of Contemporary Art in Grenoble. She also studied at the Institute des Hautes √âtudes en Arts Plastiques, in Paris. She began her career as an artist in the 1990s, working primarily in film. Her early work was mainly short, minimalistic and oneiric films. She now collaborates on everything from the writing of a science fiction novel with fellow artist Philippe Parreno to working with rock singer Alain Bashung on set design. She has also collaborated with fashion house Balenciaga in designing displays for their fashion boutiques in New York and Paris. She has even designed a house for a collector in Tokyo. Inspired by film, literature, modernist architecture, and art history, her work is often characterized by a quiet, intimate interrogation of contemporary urban life. Often she will use fragments from her international travels in her work and reassembles them into something new. \\"My approach to art is quite radical. It has more to do with theater and staging than making objects such as paintings or sculptures. Sometimes I think that the fetishism of objects is pathetic. It's one way to deal with art, but I'm obsessed with other things\\". She also hopes that her installations will encourage people to interact with them. \\"I want to coax people to engage with my art, in the same way that a writer might entice people to read a book\\". She was the recipient of an artist residency in Villa Kujoyama, Kyoto in 1996, the Mies van der Rohe Award in Krefeld in 1996, and the 2002 Marcel Duchamp Prize in Paris. For the season 2015/2016 in the Vienna State Opera Gonzalez-Foerster designed a large-scale picture (176 sqm) as part of the exhibition series \\"Safety Curtain\\", conceived by museum in progress.

At the opening of the show Dominique said, \\" Some months ago, I used to wake up in the silence of the night to think about what I was going to do. But not anymore. People ask me, 'Are you scared?' No, I am not scared. If I was, I wouldn't do it. Rather, I'm excited. I am putting one third of my energy into just staying calm.

The Hispanic Society of America is a museum and research library with an impressive collection of paintings, decorative objects, books, documents, prints, and photographs. However, Dominique discovered it only had a limited supply of 20th century literature and wanted to fill in the gaps. She enlisted help from experts at the American Museum of Natural History. The project involved crafting three habitats in which volumes by nearly 40 authors replaced taxidermied fauna. One evokes water and verticality; another, aridity and flatness; the third, trailing vines. They represent three zones: North America, the Desert, and the Tropics. Aside from the books, each diorama contains a single, mute trace of human presence. In the underwater ocean scene there is an oil barrel. In the desert scene there are ruins of a concrete bunker. In the tropical scene there is a desolate, glass house. They each show the wear and tear of passing time. Many of the books in the dioramas are about anxiety and exile. She also created a mural-sized calligram (an arrangement of words that creates a related visual image). This is Mikhail Bakhtin's concept of the chronotope; \\"functioning as the primary means for materializing time in space with the novel\\". The installation is housed in an annex to the library.

His first book, The Age of Intelligent Machines, published in 1990, put forth his theories on the results of the increasing use of technology and predicted the explosive growth in the internet, among other predictions. Later works, 1999's The Age of Spiritual Machines and 2005's The Singularity is Near outlined other theories including the rise of clouds of nano-robots (nanobots) called foglets and the development of Human Body 2.0 and 3.0, whereby nanotechnology is incorporated into many internal organs. Accuracy of predictions =The Age of Intelligent Machines= Kurzweil's first book, The Age of Intelligent Machines, was published in 1990. It forecast the demise of the already crumpling Soviet Union due to new technologies such as cellular phones and fax machines disempowering authoritarian governments by removing state control over the flow of information. In 2005, Mikhail Gorbachev told Kurzweil that emerging decentralized electronic communication \\"was a big factor\\" for fostering democracy in the Soviet Union. Kurzweil extrapolated the performance of chess software to predict that computers would beat the best human players \\"by the year 2000\\". In May 1997 chess World Champion Garry Kasparov was defeated by IBM's Deep Blue computer in a well-publicized chess tournament. Perhaps most significantly, Kurzweil foresaw the explosive growth in worldwide Internet use that began in the 1990s. At the time of the publication of The Age of Intelligent Machines, there were only 2.6 million Internet users in the world, and the medium was often unreliable outside academic, military, corporate and other heavily invested settings, difficult for non-technical users to use, and mostly lacking a broad range of content. He also stated that the Internet would explode not only in the number of users but in content as well, eventually granting users access \\"to international networks of libraries, data bases, and information services\\". Additionally, Kurzweil correctly foresaw that the preferred mode of Internet access would inevitably be through wireless systems, and he was also correct to estimate that the latter would become practical for widespread use in the early 21st century. =The Age of Spiritual Machines= In 1999, Kurzweil published a second book titled The Age of Spiritual Machines, which goes into more depth explaining his futurist ideas. The third and final section of the book is devoted to elucidating the specific course of technological advancements Kurzweil believes the world will experience over the next century. Titled \\"To Face the Future\\", the section is divided into four chapters respectively named \\"2009\\", \\"2019\\", \\"2029\\", and \\"2099\\". For every chapter, Kurzweil issues predictions about what life and technology will be like in that year. Kurzweil restated his earlier prediction from The Age of Intelligent Machines regarding the advent of pocket-sized, cheap, text-to-speech converters for the blind by 2009. The \\"Kurzweil-National Federation of the Blind Reader\\" (K-NFB Reader) was introduced in 2005 at a price of $3,495. The device was portable, but not the cheap, pocket-sized device of the prediction. By 2008, a software version for the (pocket-sized) Nokia N82 smartphone was available for $1,595. A version for iOS phones was released for $99 in 2014 and Android for $75 in 2015. =The Singularity Is Near= While this book focuses on the future of technology and the human race as The Age of Intelligent Machines and The Age of Spiritual Machines did, Kurzweil makes very few concrete, short-term predictions in The Singularity Is Near, though longer-term visions abound. Kurzweil predicted that, in 2005, supercomputers with the computational capacities to simulate protein folding will be introduced. In 2010, a supercomputer simulated protein folding for a very small protein at an atomic level over a period of a millisecond. The protein folded and unfolded, with the results closely matching experimental data. The biyearly protein structure prediction contest CASP shows that the current algorithms for structure prediction are still impractical for determining the previously unknown structure of most proteins. =Other sources= In an October 2002 article published on his website, Kurzweil stated that \\"Deep Fritz-like chess programs running on ordinary personal computers will routinely defeat all humans later in this decade.\\"Deep Fritz Draws: Are Humans Getting Smarter, or Are Computers Getting Stupider?

Future predictions =The Age of Intelligent Machines (1990)= Late 20th century *Predicts that he and his company will create a \\"voice-activated typewriter\\" by 1995. * By 1999 \\"consumers will be able to sit down at their home computers and design their own clothes to their own precise measurements and style requirements using friendly, computer-assisted design software\\".Drake Baer, 5 amazing predictions by futurist Ray Kurzweil that came true ‚Äî and 4 that haven't, (Oct. 20, 2015). Early 2000s *Translating telephones allow people to speak to each other in different languages. *Machines designed to transcribe speech into computer text allow deaf people to understand spoken words. *Exoskeletal, robotic leg prostheses allow the paraplegic to walk. *Telephone calls are routinely screened by intelligent answering machines that ask questions to determine the call's nature and priority. *\\"Cybernetic chauffeurs\\" can drive cars for humans and can be retrofitted into existing cars. They work by communicating with other vehicles and with sensors embedded along the roads. * \\"Lifetime patient records and histories will be maintained in nationally (or internationally) coordinated data banks\\". Not an accurate prediction. Early 21st century *The classroom is dominated by computers. Intelligent courseware that can tailor itself to each student by recognizing their strengths and weaknesses. Media technology allows students to manipulate and interact with virtual depictions of the systems and personalities they are studying. *A small number of highly skilled people dominates the entire production sector. Tailoring of products for individuals is common. *Drugs are designed and tested in simulations that mimic the human body. *Blind people navigate and read text using machines that can visually recognize features of their environment. 2010 *PCs are capable of answering queries by accessing information wirelessly via the Internet. * A fully matured cloud computing network: \\"[Computers] will tap into the worldwide mesh (what the World Wide Web will become once all of its linked devices become communicating Web servers, thereby forming vast supercomputers and memory banks) of high- speed communications and computational resources.\\" 2020‚Äì2050 *Phone calls entail three-dimensional holographic images of both people. *A computer passes the Turing Test, becoming the first true artificial intelligence. Kurzweil has even wagered that his predictions will be true, on the site Long Bets betting against Mitchell Kapor, founder of Lotus Software Corporation for a payout of $20,000, or $10,000 each. Centuries hence *Computer intelligence becomes superior to human intelligence in all areas. =The Age of Spiritual Machines (1999)= 2009 *\\"Personal computers are available in a wide range of sizes and shapes, and are commonly embedded in clothing and jewelry such as wristwatches, rings, earrings and other body ornaments\\". *The majority of reading is done on displays rather than paper, though paper documents (including print books) are still common. *Most text will be created using speech recognition technology. *Intelligent roads and driverless cars are in use, mostly on highways. Local roads still require full human interaction. *People use personal computers the size of rings, pins, credit cards and books. * Most portable computers do not have moving parts or keyboards. *Though desktop PCs are still common for data storage, individuals primarily use portable devices for their computer-related tasks. * Personal worn computers provide monitoring of body functions, automated identity and directions for navigation. * Many devices offer high-speed network access via wireless technology. Which was an accurate prediction. * \\"Most routine business transactions (purchases, travel, reservations) take place between a human and a virtual personality. Often, the virtual presentation includes an animated visual presence that looks like a human face.\\"Alex Knapp, Ray Kurzweil's Predictions For 2009 Were Mostly Inaccurate, Mar 20, 2012. *Digital products such as books, songs, games, movies and software are typically acquired as files via a wireless network and have no physical object associated with them. *Cables are disappearing. Computer peripherals use wireless communication. *People can talk to their computer to give commands. *Computer displays built into eyeglasses for augmented reality are used. *Computers can recognize their owner's face from a picture or video. *Three- dimensional chips are commonly used. *Sound-producing speakers are being replaced with very small chip-based devices that can place high-resolution sound anywhere in three-dimensional space. *A $1,000 computer can perform a trillion calculations per second. *Supercomputers have been built that can operate at 20 petaflops (roughly the hardware-equivalent of the human brain according to Kurzweil). *Consumer-level computers across the world can network together to form decentralized supercomputers, many of which have the computational capacity of the human brain. *There is increasing interest in massively parallel neural nets, genetic algorithms, and other forms of \\"chaotic\\" or complexity theory computing. *Research has been initiated on reverse engineering the brain through both destructive and non-invasive scans. *Autonomous nano-engineered machines have been demonstrated and include their own computational controls. *Digital documents routinely display moving images and sounds. *Artificial voices sound fully human. *Phones can translate spoken sentences to different languages and read them back aloud. *Telephone communication is mostly wireless. *Cell phones display high-resolution images. Users can engage in audio-video teleconferences. *High-resolution audio-visual cybersex is common, aided by falling costs of high-speed internet and computer hardware. *At least 50% of all transactions are conducted over the internet. *Personal artificial digital assistants are in widespread use. They can understand spoken language, look up answers to questions, set appointments, conduct transactions, tell jokes, and more. *An increasing share of the population is working from home and while traveling. *The typical home has over 100 computers in it, many of which are embedded in appliances. *Though not yet ubiquitous, many households have one or more robots that perform some type of housekeeping. *People often play music alongside digital musicians. (In \\"How My Predictions Are Faring\\" written in 2010, and \\"Ray Kurzweil Defends His 2009 Predictions\\" written in 2012 Kurzweil cited Guitar Hero and Apple's Magic GarageBand Jam as two examples.) *Audio-visual virtual reality has entered the mass market. Users can digitally tour real locations or play in highly immersive fantasy worlds. Tactile (haptic) VR technology is still primitive however. *Militaries rely heavily on armed unmanned airborne devices. * \\"Bioengineered treatments for cancer and heart disease have greatly reduced the mortality from these diseases.\\"(\\"Stem cell transplants, including peripheral blood, bone marrow, and cord blood transplants, can be used to treat cancer.\\"wayback machine) ~~~~*Telemedicine is common. Devices monitor and relay health-related data of many patients and send that information to doctors remotely. Teleconferencing between doctor and patient is also popular. *Computers and medical software are capable enough at image and pattern recognition that they are routinely used to help diagnose diseases by analyzing scans of patients. *Doctors and medical students often train in virtual reality environments, which include haptic feedback and simulated patients. * \\"The neo-Luddite movement is growing.\\" * \\"Accelerating returns from the advance of computer technology have resulted in continued economic expansion.\\" (\\"U.S. real gross domestic product (real GDP shown in constant 2005 dollars) grew every year except for a small decline in 2009. It grew by 21 percent in constant dollars over the decade.\\" -Kurzweil ~~~~) *\\"Personal computers with high-resolution visual displays come in a range of sizes, from those small enough to be embedded in clothing and jewelry up to the size of a thin book.\\" 2019 *The computational capacity of a $4,000 computing device (in 1999 dollars) is approximately equal to the computational capability of the human brain (20 quadrillion calculations per second). *The summed computational powers of all computers is comparable to the total brainpower of the human race. *Computers are embedded everywhere in the environment (inside of furniture, jewelry, walls, clothing, etc.). *People experience 3-D virtual reality through glasses and contact lenses that beam images directly to their retinas (retinal display). Coupled with an auditory source (headphones), users can remotely communicate with other people and access the Internet. *These special glasses and contact lenses can deliver \\"augmented reality\\" and \\"virtual reality\\" in three different ways. First, they can project \\"heads-up-displays\\" (HUDs) across the user's field of vision, superimposing images that stay in place in the environment regardless of the user's perspective or orientation. Second, virtual objects or people could be rendered in fixed locations by the glasses, so when the user's eyes look elsewhere, the objects appear to stay in their places. Third, the devices could block out the \\"real\\" world entirely and fully immerse the user in a virtual reality environment. *People communicate with their computers via two- way speech and gestures instead of with keyboards. Furthermore, most of this interaction occurs through computerized assistants with different personalities that the user can select or customize. Dealing with computers thus becomes more and more like dealing with a human being. *Most business transactions or information inquiries involve dealing with a simulated person. *Most people own more than one PC, though the concept of what a \\"computer\\" is has changed considerably: Computers are no longer limited in design to laptops or CPUs contained in a large box connected to a monitor. Instead, devices with computer capabilities come in all sorts of unexpected shapes and sizes. *Cables connecting computers and peripherals have almost completely disappeared. *Rotating computer hard drives are no longer used. *Three- dimensional nanotube lattices are the dominant computing substrate. *Massively parallel neural nets and genetic algorithms are in wide use. *Destructive scans of the brain and noninvasive brain scans have allowed scientists to understand the brain much better. The algorithms that allow the relatively small genetic code of the brain to construct a much more complex organ are being transferred into computer neural nets. *Pinhead-sized cameras are everywhere. *Nanotechnology is more capable and is in use for specialized applications, yet it has not yet made it into the mainstream. \\"Nanoengineered machines\\" begin to be used in manufacturing. *Thin, lightweight, handheld displays with very high resolutions are the preferred means for viewing documents. The aforementioned computer eyeglasses and contact lenses are also used for this same purpose, and all download the information wirelessly. *Computers have made paper books and documents almost completely obsolete. *Most learning is accomplished through intelligent, adaptive courseware presented by computer-simulated teachers. In the learning process, human adults fill the counselor and mentor roles instead of being academic instructors. These assistants are often not physically present, and help students remotely. *Students still learn together and socialize, though this is often done remotely via computers. *All students have access to computers. *Most human workers spend the majority of their time acquiring new skills and knowledge. *Blind people wear special glasses that interpret the real world for them through speech. Sighted people also use these glasses to amplify their own abilities. *Retinal and neural implants also exist, but are in limited use because they are less useful. *Deaf people use special glasses that convert speech into text or signs, and music into images or tactile sensations. Cochlear and other implants are also widely used. *People with spinal cord injuries can walk and climb steps using computer-controlled nerve stimulation and exoskeletal robotic walkers. *Computers are also found inside of some humans in the form of cybernetic implants. These are most commonly used by disabled people to regain normal physical faculties (e.g. Retinal implants allow the blind to see and spinal implants coupled with mechanical legs allow the paralyzed to walk). *Language translating machines are of much higher quality, and are routinely used in conversations. *Effective language technologies (natural language processing, speech recognition, speech synthesis) exist. *Anyone can wirelessly access the internet with wearable devices such as computerized glasses, contacts, and watches. *Traditional computers and communication devices such as desktop PCs, laptops, and cell phones still exist, but most of their functions can be performed by wearable gadgets. Examples include reading books, listening to music, watching movies, playing games, and teleconferencing. *Devices that deliver sensations to the skin surface of their users (e.g. tight body suits and gloves) are also sometimes used in virtual reality to complete the experience. \\"Virtual sex\\"‚Äîin which two people are able to have sex with each other through virtual reality, or in which a human can have sex with a \\"simulated\\" partner that only exists on a computer‚Äîbecomes a reality. *Just as visual and auditory virtual reality have come of age, haptic technology has fully matured and is completely convincing, yet requires the user to enter a V.R. booth. It is commonly used for computer sex and remote medical examinations. It is the preferred sexual medium since it is safe and enhances the experience. *Worldwide economic growth has continued. There has not been a global economic collapse. *The vast majority of business interactions occur between humans and simulated retailers, or between a human's virtual personal assistant and a simulated retailer. *Household robots are ubiquitous and reliable. *Computers do most of the vehicle driving‚Äîhumans are in fact prohibited from driving on highways unassisted. Furthermore, when humans do take over the wheel, the onboard computer system constantly monitors their actions and takes control whenever the human drives recklessly. As a result, there are very few transportation accidents. *Most roads now have automated driving systems‚Äînetworks of monitoring and communication devices that allow computer-controlled automobiles to safely navigate. *Prototype personal flying vehicles using microflaps exist. They are also primarily computer-controlled. *Humans are beginning to have deep relationships with automated personalities, which hold some advantages over human partners. The depth of some computer personalities convinces some people that they should be accorded more rights. *Most decisions made by humans involve consultation with machine intelligence. For example, a doctor may seek the advice of a digital assistant. A lawyer might utilize a virtual researcher. Or a shopper may receive recommendations from a software program that has learned his or her shopping habits. *While a growing number of humans believe that their computers and the simulated personalities they interact with are intelligent to the point of human-level consciousness, experts dismiss the possibility that any could pass the Turing Test. *Human- robot relationships begin as simulated personalities become more convincing. *Interaction with virtual personalities becomes a primary interface. *Public places and workplaces are ubiquitously monitored to prevent violence and all actions are recorded permanently. Personal privacy is a major political issue, and some people protect themselves with unbreakable computer codes. *The basic needs of the underclass are met (not specified if this pertains only to the developed world or to all countries). *Virtual artists‚Äîcreative computers capable of making their own art and music‚Äîemerge in all fields of the arts. *Most flying weapons are bird-sized robots. Some are as small as insects. *Average life expectancy is over 100. *Computerized watches, clothing, and jewelry can monitor the wearer's health continuously. They can detect many types of diseases and offer recommendations for treatment. 2029 *A $1,000 personal computer is 1,000 times more powerful than the human brain. *The vast majority of computation is done by computers and not by human brains. *Further progress has been made in understanding the secrets of the human brain. Hundreds of distinct sub-regions with specialized functions have been identified. Some of the algorithms that code for development of these regions have been deciphered and incorporated into neural net computers. *Massively parallel neural nets, which are constructed through reverse- engineering the human brain, are in common use. *The eyeglasses and headphones that used to deliver virtual reality are now obsolete thanks to computer implants that go into the eyes and ears. The implants are either permanent or removable. They allow direct interface with computers, communications and Internet-based applications. The implants are also capable of recording what the user sees and hears. *Computer implants designed for direct connection to the brain are also available. They are capable of augmenting natural senses and of enhancing higher brain functions like memory, learning speed and overall intelligence. *Computers are now capable of learning and creating new knowledge entirely on their own and with no human help. By scanning the enormous content of the Internet, some computers \\"know\\" literally every single piece of public information (every scientific discovery, every book and movie, every public statement, etc.) generated by human beings. *Direct brain implants allow users to enter full-immersion virtual reality‚Äîwith complete sensory stimulation‚Äîwithout any external equipment. People can have their minds in a totally different place at any moment. This technology is in widespread use. *Most communication occurs between humans and machines as opposed to human-to-human. *The manufacturing, agricultural and transportation sectors of the economy are almost entirely automated and employ very few humans. Across the world, poverty, war and disease are almost nonexistent thanks to technology alleviating want. *The rise of Artificial Intelligence creates a real \\"robot rights\\" movement, and there is open, public debate over what sorts of civil rights and legal protections machines should have. The existence of humans with heavy levels of cybernetic augmentation and of larger numbers of other people with less extreme cybernetic implants lead to further arguments over what constitutes a \\"human being.\\" *Although computers routinely pass the Turing Test, controversy still persists over whether machines are as intelligent as humans in all areas. *Artificial Intelligences claim to be conscious and openly petition for recognition of the fact. Most people admit and accept this new truth. * Reverse engineering of the human brain completed. * Non-biological intelligence combines the subtlety and pattern recognition strength of human intelligence, with the speed, memory, and knowledge-sharing of machine intelligence. * Non-biological intelligence will continue to grow exponentially whereas biological intelligence is effectively fixed in its rate of growth. 2049 *Food is commonly \\"assembled\\" by nanomachines. This food is externally indistinguishable from \\"natural\\" food, but it can be made more wholesome since production can be controlled at the molecular level. This technology decouples food production from climate conditions and the availability of natural resources. *The distinction between virtual reality and \\"real\\" reality becomes confounded as foglets come into common use, allowing immediate assembly or disassembly of all sorts of physical objects. 2072 *Picoengineering (technology on the scale of trillionths of a meter) becomes practical. 2099 *The human brain has been completely reverse engineered and all aspects of its functioning are understood. *Natural human thinking possesses no advantages over computer minds. *Machines have attained equal legal status with humans. *Humans and machines merge in the physical and mental realms. Cybernetic brain implants enable humans to fuse their minds with AIs. *In consequence, clear distinctions between humans and machines no longer exist. *Most conscious beings lack a permanent physical form. *The vast majority of the Earth's sentient beings are AIs that exist entirely as thinking computer programs capable of instantly moving from one computer to another across the Internet (or whatever equivalent exists in 2099). These computer-based beings are capable of manifesting themselves at will in the physical world by creating or taking over robotic bodies, with individual AIs also being capable of controlling multiple bodies at once. *Individual beings merge and separate constantly, making it impossible to determine how many ‚Äúpeople‚Äù there are on Earth. *This new plasticity of consciousness and ability for beings to join minds seriously alters the nature of self-identity. *The majority of interpersonal interactions occur in virtual environments. Actually having two people physically meet in the real world to have a conversation or transact business without any technological interference is very rare. *Organic human beings are a small minority of the intelligent life forms on Earth. Even among the remaining Homo sapiens, the use of computerized implants that heavily augment normal abilities is ubiquitous and accepted as normal. The small fraction of humans who opt to remain \\"natural\\" and unmodified effectively exist on a lower and more limited plane of consciousness from everyone else, and thus find it impossible to fully interact with AIs and highly modified humans. *\\"Natural\\" humans are protected from extermination. In spite of their shortcomings and frailties, humans are respected by AIs for giving rise to the machines. *Since knowledge and skills can be instantly downloaded and comprehended by most intelligent beings, the process of learning is compressed into an instantaneous affair instead of the years-long struggle normal humans experience. Free from this time-consuming burden, AIs now focus their energies on making new discoveries and contributions. *AIs are capable of dividing their attention and energies in countless directions, allowing one being to manage a multitude of endeavors simultaneously. *Femtoengineering (engineering on the scale of one thousandth of a trillionth of a meter) might be possible. *AIs communicate via a shared electronic language. *Artwork and music created by machines encompasses areas of the light spectrum and frequencies of sounds that normal humans cannot perceive. *Money has deflated in value, meaning all sorts of goods and services have become cheaper. *Some humans at least as old as the Baby Boomers are still alive and well. *Computer viruses are a major threat since most intelligent beings are software-based. *AIs frequently make \\"backup copies\\" of themselves, guaranteeing a sort of immortality should the original AI be killed. *The concept of \\"life expectancy\\" has become irrelevant to humans and machines thanks to medical immortality and advanced computers. *The pace of technological change continues to accelerate as the 22nd century nears. Thousands of years from now *\\"Intelligently (emotional) beings consider the fate of all the Universe.\\" =The Singularity is Near (2005)= 2010 *Supercomputers will have the same raw computing power as human brains, though the software to emulate human thinking on those computers does not yet exist (IBM Sequoia). *Computers will start to disappear as distinct physical objects, meaning many will have nontraditional shapes or will be embedded in clothing and everyday objects. *Full-immersion audio-visual virtual reality will exist. 2015 *By now, it is likely that \\"clean a house\\" will be within the capabilities of a household robot. 2018 *1013 bits (=10 TB) of computer memory‚Äîroughly the equivalent of the memory space in a single human brain‚Äîwill cost $1000. 10 terabytes of storage (not memory) have been already reached for $535 (Seagate Barracuda 10TB) in mid 2016. 2010s * The decade in which \\"Bridge Two\\", the revolution in Genetics/Biotechnology, is to reach its peak. During the 2020s, humans will have the means of changing their genes; not just \\"designer babies\\" will be feasible, but designer baby boomers through the rejuvenation of all of one's body's tissues and organs by transforming one's skin cells into youthful versions of every other cell type. People will be able to \\"reprogram\\" their own biochemistry away from disease and aging, radically extending life expectancy. *Computers become smaller and increasingly integrated into everyday life. *More and more computer devices will be used as miniature web servers, and more will have their resources pooled for computation. *High- quality broadband Internet access will become available almost everywhere. *Eyeglasses that beam images onto the users' retinas to produce virtual reality will be developed. They will also come with speakers or headphone attachments that will complete the experience with sounds. These eyeglasses will become a new medium for advertising which will be wirelessly transmitted to them as one walks by various business establishments. This was fictionalized in Denn≈ç Coil. *The VR glasses will also have built-in computers featuring \\"virtual assistant\\" programs that can help the user with various daily tasks. *Virtual assistants would be capable of multiple functions. One useful function would be real-time language translation in which words spoken in a foreign language would be translated into text that would appear as subtitles to a user wearing the glasses. *Cell phones will be built into clothing and will be able to project sounds directly into the ears of their users. *Advertisements will utilize a new technology whereby two ultrasonic beams can be targeted to intersect at a specific point, delivering a localized sound message that only a single person can hear. 2020s * The decade in which \\"Bridge Three\\", the revolution in Nanotechnology, is to begin: allowing humans to vastly overcome the inherent limitations of biology, as no matter how much humanity fine-tunes its biology, they will never be as capable otherwise. This decade also marks the revolution in robotics (Strong AI), as an AI is expected to pass the Turing test by the last year of the decade (2029), meaning it can pass for a human being (though the first A.I. is likely to be the equivalent of an average, educated human). What follows then will be an era of consolidation in which nonbiological intelligence will undergo exponential growth (Runaway AI), eventually leading to the extraordinary expansion contemplated by the Singularity, in which human intelligence is multiplied by billions by the mid-2040s. *Early in this decade, humanity will have the requisite hardware to emulate human intelligence within a $1000 personal computer, followed shortly by effective software models of human intelligence toward the middle of the decade: this will be enabled by the continuing exponential growth of brain-scanning technology, which is doubling in bandwidth, temporal and spatial resolution every year, and will be greatly amplified with nanotechnology, allowing us to have a detailed understanding of all the regions of the human brain and to aid in developing human-level machine intelligence by the end of this decade. *Computers less than 100 nm in size will be possible. *As one of their first practical applications, nanomachines are used for medical purposes. *Highly advanced medical nanobots will perform detailed brainscans on live patients. *Accurate computer simulations of the entire human brain will exist due to these hyperaccurate brainscans, and the workings of the brain will be understood. *Nanobots capable of entering the bloodstream to \\"feed\\" cells and extract waste will exist (though not necessarily be in wide use) by the end of this decade. They will make the normal mode of human food consumption obsolete. *By the late 2020s, nanotech-based manufacturing will be in widespread use, radically altering the economy as all sorts of products can suddenly be produced for a fraction of their traditional-manufacture costs. The true cost of any product is now the amount it takes to download the design schematics. *By the later part of this decade, virtual reality will be so high-quality that it will be indistinguishable from real reality. *The threat posed by genetically engineered pathogens permanently dissipates by the end of this decade as medical nanobots‚Äîinfinitely more durable, intelligent and capable than any microorganism‚Äîbecome sufficiently advanced. *The many variations of \\"Human Body 2.0\\" (as Kurzweil calls it) are incrementally accumulated into this and the following decade, with each organ and body system having its own course of refinement and development. It ultimately consists of a nanotechnological system of nourishment and circulation, obsolescing many internal organs, brain-extension and an improved skeleton. 2023 *1016 calculations per second‚Äîroughly the equivalent of one human brain‚Äîwill cost $1,000. 2025 *The most likely year for the debut of advanced nanotechnology. *Some military UAVs and land vehicles will be 100% computer-controlled. 2030s *Mind uploading becomes successful and perfected by the end of this decade as humans become software-based: living out on the Web, projecting bodies whenever they want or need (whether in virtual or real reality), and living indefinitely so long as they maintain their \\"mind file\\". Eventually, all human beings (including those with transbiological 2.0 or 3.0 bodies) will migrate to this postbiological state except for those who wish to remain unenhanced: the transbiological era giving way to the postbiological era. *Nanomachines could be directly inserted into the brain and could interact with brain cells to totally control incoming and outgoing signals. As a result, truly full-immersion virtual reality could be generated without the need for any external equipment. Afferent nerve pathways could be blocked, totally cancelling out the \\"real\\" world and leaving the user with only the desired virtual experience. *Brain nanobots could also elicit emotional responses from users. *Using brain nanobots, recorded or real-time brain transmissions of a person's daily life known as \\"experience beamers\\" will be available for other people to remotely experience. This is very similar to how the characters in Being John Malkovich were able to enter the mind of Malkovich and see the world through his eyes. *Recreational uses aside, nanomachines in peoples' brains will allow them to greatly expand their cognitive, memory and sensory capabilities, to directly interface with computers, and to \\"telepathically\\" communicate with other, similarly augmented humans via wireless networks. *The same nanotechnology should also allow people to alter the neural connections within their brains, changing the underlying basis for the person's intelligence, memories and personality. *The many variations of \\"Human Body 3.0\\" are gradually implemented during this and the following decade; It most likely lacks a fixed, corporeal form and can alter its shape and external appearance at will via foglet-like nanotechnology. 2040s *People spend most of their time in full- immersion virtual reality (Kurzweil has cited The Matrix as a good example of what the advanced virtual worlds will be like, without the dystopian twist). *Foglets are in use. *Nonbiological intelligence will be billions of times more capable than biological intelligence. 2045: The Singularity *$1000 buys a computer a billion times more intelligent than every human combined. This means that average and even low-end computers are vastly smarter than even highly intelligent, unenhanced humans. *The technological singularity occurs as artificial intelligences surpass human beings as the smartest and most capable life forms on the Earth. Technological development is taken over by the machines, who can think, act and communicate so quickly that normal humans cannot even comprehend what is going on. The machines enter into a \\"runaway reaction\\" of self-improvement cycles, with each new generation of A.I.s appearing faster and faster. From this point onwards, technological advancement is explosive, under the control of the machines, and thus cannot be accurately predicted (hence the term \\"Singularity\\"). *The Singularity is an extremely disruptive, world-altering event that forever changes the course of human history. The extermination of humanity by violent machines is unlikely (though not impossible) because sharp distinctions between man and machine will no longer exist thanks to the existence of cybernetically enhanced humans and uploaded humans. Post-2045: \\"Waking up\\" the Universe *The physical bottom limit to how small computer transistors (or other equivalent, albeit more effective components, such as memristors integrated into Crossbar latches) can be shrunk is reached. From this moment onwards, computers can only be made more powerful if they are made larger in size. *Because of this, AI's convert more and more of the Earth's matter into engineered, computational substrate capable of supporting more A.I.s. until the whole Earth is one, gigantic computer, except for a few nature reserves set aside on the planetary surface for those humans who decided to remain in their natural state. \\"MOSH's\\" (Mostly Original Substrate Human) who choose to remain purely organic would still possess virtual assistants that will act as their transcendent servants, living in the blurred real world (\\"foglet-reality\\") and being provided with environments and everything they could possibly need as they live out the rest of their normal lives unless they enhance themselves. *At this point, the only possible way to increase the intelligence of the machines any farther is to begin converting all of the matter and energy in the universe into similar massive computers. A.I.s radiate outward from Earth, first into the Solar System and then out into interstellar space, then galaxies in all directions, utilizing starships that are Von Neumann probes with nanobot crews, breaking down whole planets, stars, moons, and meteoroids and reassembling them into computers. This, in effect, \\"wakes up\\" the universe as all the inanimate \\"dumb\\" matter (rocks, dust, gases, etc.) is converted into structured matter capable of supporting life (albeit synthetic life). *Kurzweil predicts that machines might have the ability to make planet-sized computers by 2099, which underscores how enormously technology will advance after the Singularity. *The process of \\"waking up\\" the universe could be completed well before the end of the 22nd century, provided humans are not limited by the speed of light. *With the entire universe made into a giant, highly efficient supercomputer, AI and human hybrids (so integrated that, in truth it is a new category of \\"life\\") would have both supreme intelligence and physical control over the universe. It is unknown what events will happen in a post cosmic computer mind era, but whatever it is, it will truly be incomprehensible in every sense of the word to feeble human minds. Perhaps an infinite unification of infinite saturated universes, multiverses, and omniverses, an endless vast collection of united cosmic computers possibly. Some indeterminate points within a few decades from now *Space technology becomes advanced enough to provide the Earth permanent protection from the threat of asteroid impacts. *The antitechnology Luddite movement will grow increasingly vocal and possibly resort to violence as these people become enraged over the emergence of new technologies that threaten traditional attitudes regarding the nature of human life (radical life extension, genetic engineering, cybernetics) and the supremacy of humankind (artificial intelligence). Though the Luddites might, at best, succeed in delaying the Singularity, the march of technology is irresistible and they will inevitably fail in keeping the world frozen at a fixed level of development. *The emergence of distributed energy grids and full-immersion virtual reality will, when combined with high bandwidth Internet, enable the ultimate in telecommuting. This, in turn, will make cities obsolete since workers will no longer need to be located near their workplaces. The decentralization of the population will make societies less vulnerable to terrorist and military attacks. =Other sources= 2006 C-SPAN interview Kurzweil made the following predictions during a November 5, 2006 interview on C-SPAN's Book TV program. *\\"Within 20 years we will...have models and simulations of all several hundred regions of the brain, including the cerebral cortex...and we'll have the secrets of human intelligence...and then machines will operate at human levels.\\" (9:40) *In the 2020s, it will be possible to send machines into human brains through capillaries, allowing direct amplification of human intelligence. (16:50) *In 25 years, there will be advanced nanobots that can go inside human bodies and keep them healthy. (19:30) *Nanobots will be \\"the size of red blood cells.\\" While a nanobot's subcomponents would be under 100 nm long, the overall size of a nanobot could be measured in micrometers (¬µm). (19:50) *A Turing Test should go on for \\"hours.\\" By 2029, AIs the pass the Turing Test will have \\"the equivalent of human intelligence.\\" (27:30) *By the early 2030s, machines will persuasively display human emotions, human-level intelligence, and will claim to be conscious. (36:00) *\\"We will get to full- scale molecular nanotechnology in about 20 years.\\" Moore's Second Law will be negated by self-organizing computer chips. (42:00) *Intel's \\"roadmap\\" shows that computer chips will have 4nm features by 2020. (43:30) *We will switch from 2D to computer 3D chips before Moore's Law stops. The exponentially improving cost-performance of computation will thus have no interruption. (45:00) *In the early 2010s, cell phones will commonly offer speech-to-text transcription capabilities and language translation capabilities. (48:30) *VR/AR glasses that project images onto wearers' retinas will be common in the early 2010s. It will become \\"routine technology\\" by the end of that decade. (52:00) *Kurzweil believes the first machine to pass the Turing Test will be his VR avatar/chatbot \\"Ramona.\\" (58:30) *Nanobots in people's brains will enable full-immersion virtual reality in \\"20 years or so.\\" (1:07:50) *In 15 years, we will be able to reprogram our biology just as we program computers today. (1:36:00) *In 25 years, we will have advanced nanobots that can enter our bodies and fix our cells, keeping us healthy. (1:37:00) *In 15 years, we will hit life extension escape velocity. It will apply to people of all ages, including old people. (1:40:00) *In about a century, humans will saturate their part of the universe with intelligence.

(2:40:00) *In 15-20 years, humans will be able to use biotechnology to \\"reprogram\\" themselves so that cancer, heart disease and other serious diseases become manageable conditions and not fatal ones. It is even possible those diseases will be cured. The same technology will let bioterrorists create newer, deadly pathogens. (2:53:00) *Advanced future technologies will not end human conflict, but the 21st century will probably be less warlike than the 20th century. (2:57:00) Kurzweil has said that by 2014, humanity will reach a \\"tipping point\\" where the cost-per-watt from solar energy is cheaper than from coal and oil: By capturing only 0.03 percent of the sun's energy that falls on Earth, humanity could meet virtually all of its projected energy needs up to 2030Human 2.0. By: Kurzweil, Ray, New Scientist, 02624079, September 24, 2005, Vol. 187, Issue 2518 (thirty trillion watts); this will be capable through with extremely inexpensive, lightweight, and efficient nano-engineered solar panels together with nano-fuel cells to store and distribute the captured energy. Kurzweil believes, by the end of the 2020s, humans will be able to completely replace fossil fuels. Kurzweil has said that by the 2030s, people will be able to send nano-bots into their brains through their capillaries. The nano-bots will take up positions in close physical proximity to each interneuronal connection coming from each physical sense and cause the firing of neurons to result in full-immersion virtual reality, similar to the way psychedelic drugs alter consciousness. The nano-bots will also allow people to \\"connect their neocortex to the cloud\\". This technology is based on ‚Äúneuron transistors‚Äù developed by scientists at the Max Planck Institute that can control the firing of neurons. Kurzweil said the following in a November 2007 Computerworld interview: *Speech-to-speech translation features will be available in cell phones in either 2009 or 2010.Lamont, Ian. (November 13, 2007) The Kurzweil interview, continued: Portable computing, virtual reality, immortality, and strong vs. narrow AI Computerworld Blogs. Blogs.computerworld.com. Retrieved on 2016-05-03. *By 2017, computers will have become even more ubiquitous in the environment, largely owing to smaller size. Some will be woven into clothing and will be \\"self-organizing.\\" *By the same year, practical virtual reality glasses will be in use. The devices will work by beaming images directly onto the retinas of their users, creating large, three-dimensional floating images in the person's field of view. Such devices would provide a visual experience on par with a very large television, but would be highly portable, combining the best features of a portable video player and a widescreen TV. The glasses will deliver full-immersion virtual reality. *By 2017, \\"augmented reality\\" will exist: The V.R. glasses previously mentioned will have advanced computers and sensors built into them that will be able to recognize elements within the user's environment and then provide appropriate information and assistance through visual or auditory means. If the user looks at a building or a person's face, the computer will provide information through a \\"heads-up- display\\" beamed onto the person's retinas. The devices could also be used for keeping track of schedules, navigating, and querying for general information. * \\"By 2019, we will largely overcome the major diseases that kill 95 percent of us in the developed world, and we will be dramatically slowing and reversing the dozen or so processes that underlie aging.\\" *By 2022, medical technology will be more than a thousand times more advanced than it is today, and the \\"tipping point\\" of human life expectancy will have been reached, with every new year of research guaranteeing at least one more year of life expectancy. Kurzweil also states that 3‚Äì4 months of life expectancy were added in 2007 due to the development of new medicines and treatments. *Cell phones and PCs will be increasingly woven into a global grid of computers wirelessly connected to the Internet. Instead of each device just sending and receiving its own data, more and more of the machines will be tasked with processing foreign data, creating a huge, interconnected network with millions of nodes. *By 2027, accurate computer simulations of all parts of the human brain will exist. Criticism In the cover article of the December 2010 issue of IEEE Spectrum, John Rennie criticized Kurzweil's predictions: \\"On close examination, his clearest and most successful predictions often lack originality or profundity. And most of his predictions come with so many loopholes that they border on the unfalsifiable.\\" In a January 2017 blog article on his website, software developer Paul Feakins found that Kurzweil's analysis of his own prediction accuracy was heavily biased in his favour. Feakins rated Kurzweil's accuracy at closer to 36% on predictions that could be verified at that time.The Singularity is Near: How Kurzweil's Predictions Are Faring References Category:Evolution Category:Futures studies Category:Singularitarianism Category:Philosophy of artificial intelligence ","title":"Predictions made by Ray Kurzweil"},{"id":"20044870","text":"The Gala-Salvador Dal√≠ Foundation is a private cultural institution founded by the painter Salvador Dal√≠ with the mission of promoting his artistic, cultural and intellectual oeuvre.

A single- engined biplane, two were built to compete in the 1924 Schneider Trophy air race. However the crash of the first prototype during testing meant that it could not be made ready for the race, which was postponed. The second aircraft was also lost in a crash. Design and development The 1923 Schneider Trophy race for seaplanes had been won by the United States Navy with the Curtiss CR-3, a floatplane which outclassed Britain's entry, the Supermarine Sea Lion III flying boat.Mondey 1981, p. 40. In a change from previous years, where Britain's entries had been privately funded, the British Air Ministry ordered two racing seaplanes from the Gloster Aircraft Company to compete for the 1924 race.James 1971, p. 107. The resulting aircraft, designated the Gloster II, was a floatplane development of Gloster's earlier Gloster I racing aircraft, which had won the annual Aerial Derby air race three years running between 1921 and 1923, and had attempted unsuccessfully to break the World airspeed record in 1922.James 1971, pp. 69‚Äì73. It was a small single-seat biplane of fabric covered wooden construction, powered by a closely faired Napier Lion engine. It had short-span single bay wings and a twin float undercarriage, with radiators mounted on the struts supporting the floats. The first aircraft, with the serial number J7504, was ready for flight testing in September 1924. However, when attempting to land after its first test flight, on 19 September 1924, the undercarriage collapsed and the aircraft sank, with pilot Hubert Broad escaping unhurt.Flight 25 September 1925, p. 630.Jackson 1973, p. 313. There was insufficient time to prepare the second aircraft for the race, scheduled for October, but as no other European nation had an entry ready to compete, the Americans postponed the race until 1925.Mondey 1981, pp. 40‚Äì41. The second aircraft was converted to a landplane and used for flight testing equipment to be used for the Gloster III racer being designed for the 1925 competition.

The prison was operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, and was situated next to HMP Wolds. In 2014, HM Prison Everthorpe was merged with HM Prison Wolds, and renamed HM Prison Humber. History Originally a borstal at its creation in 1958 to replace Dartmoor Prison, in 1991 Everthorpe Prison was converted to house male convicts. During the Christmas and New Year period of 1995/1996, Everthorpe experienced some prisoner unrest that resulted in a large, two-day prison riot. According to investigators, the unrest was caused by official steps to eliminate drug use by inmates and also by shortages of tobacco and phonecards, which had run out over the holiday period. The prison was criticised for its lack of security, bad management and the deployment of inexperienced staff during the riot.HighBeam An inspection report from the Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons in July 2004 praised Everthorpe Prison for its education and training programmes, but warned that Everthorpe needed to ensure that all inmates at the prison benefitted from these programmes. The prison was substantially expanded in 2005. In an inspection report a year later, Everthorpe was criticised by the Chief Inspector of Prisons because places on resettlement and offending behaviour programmes had \\"failed to keep pace\\" with the increased number of prisoners held at the prison. The report also highlighted problems with bullying amongst inmates. In January 2008 it emerged that inmates at Everthorpe had been regularly smuggling drugs, mobile phones and women's clothing into the prison. A ladder had been used by an accomplice on the outside to scale the 20-foot perimeter wall of the prison to supply these items, with the racket reportedly continuing for at least six months. The prison Everthorpe was a Category C training prison with a strong emphasis of on education and training. Education at Everthorpe was provided by The Manchester College and East Riding College with courses including Literacy, Numeracy, Art and Design, Information Technology, Business, wall and floor tiling, Painting and Decorating, Bricklaying, Industrial cleaning, and Computer Aided Design. The PE department at the prison also ran various Physical Education courses as well as recreational gym. It was announced in June 2013 that HM Prisons Everthorpe and Wolds would merge into one larger prison under a new name: HM Prison Humber.

First ideas had their origin in his graduate student years in the 1970s. Jointly with his brother Thomas Cremer, now professor (chair) of Anthropology and Human Genetics at the Ludwigs-Maximilian University in Munich, Christoph Cremer proposed the development of a hologram-based laser scanning 4Pi microscope. The basic idea was to focus laser light from all sides (space angle 4Pi) in a spot with a diameter smaller than the conventional laser focus and to scan the object by means of this spot. In this manner, it should be possible to achieve an improved optical resolution beyond the conventional limit of approx. 200 nm lateral, 600 nm axial.C. Cremer and T. Cremer (1978): Considerations on a laser-scanning-microscope with high resolution and depth of field Microscopica Acta VOL. 81 NUMBER 1 September, pp. 31‚Äî44 (1978) Since 1992, 4Pi microscopy has been developed by Stefan Hell (Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, G√∂ttingen) into a highly efficient, high-resolution imaging process, using two microscope objective lenses of high numeric aperture opposing each other. = Development of the first DNA laser-UV-microirradiation technique for living cells = In the early 1970s, the brothers realized a UV laser micro irradiation instrument which for the first time made it possible to irradiate in a controlled manner only a tiny part of a living cell at the absorption maximum for DNA (257 nm). This replaced the conventional UV partial irradiation practiced for over 60 years. In this way, it was possible for the first time to induce alterations in the DNA in a focused manner (i.e. at predetermined places in the cell nucleus of living cells) without compromising the cells ability to divide and to survive. Specific very small cell regions could be irradiated and thus the dynamics of macromolecules (DNA) contained there quantitatively estimated. Furthermore, due to the high speed of the process using irradiation times of fractions of a second, it became possible to irradiate even moving cell organelles. This development provided the basis for important experiments in the area of genome structure research (establishing the existence of so-called chromosome territories in living mammalian cells) and led, a few years later (1979/1980) to a successful collaboration with the biologist Christiane N√ºsslein-Volhard (Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, T√ºbingen). In this collaboration Cremer used his UV laser micro irradiation equipment to elicit cellular changes in the early larval stages of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. = Development of the confocal laser scanning microscopy for fluorescence = On the basis of experience gained in the construction and application of the UV laser micro irradiation instrument, the Cremer brothers designed in 1978 a laser scanning process which scans point-by-point the three-dimensional surface of an object by means of a focused laser beam and creates the over-all picture by electronic means similar to those used in scanning electron microscopes. It is this plan for the construction of a confocal laser scanning microscope (CSLM), which for the first time combined the laser scanning method with the 3D detection of biological objects labeled with fluorescent markers that earned Cremer his professorial position at the University of Heidelberg. During the next decade, the confocal fluorescence microscopy was developed into a technically fully matured state in particular by groups working at the University of Amsterdam and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg and their industry partners. In later years, this technology was adopted widely by biomolecular and biomedical laboratories and remains to this day the gold standard as far as three- dimensional light microscopy with conventional resolution is concerned. = Development of the super resolution microscopy methods = The goal of microscopy is in many cases to determine the size of individual, small objects. Conventional fluorescence microscopy can only establish sizes to around the conventional optical resolution limit of approximately 200 nm (lateral).

Filed 5 April 1971; publication date 12 October 1972.Deutsches Patentamt, Berlin. http://depatisnet.dpma.de/DepatisNet/depatisnet?action=pdf&docid;=DE000002116521A Christoph Cremer returned to the problem of the diffraction limit. With the Vertico SMI microscope he could realize his various super resolution techniques including SMI, SPDM, SPDMphymod and LIMON. These methods are mainly used for biomedical applications Spatially Modulated Illumination SMI Around 1995, he commenced with the development of a light microscopic process, which achieved a substantially improved size resolution of cellular nanostructures stained with a fluorescent marker. This time he employed the principle of wide field microscopy combined with structured laser illumination (spatially modulated illumination, SMI)US patent 7,342,717, filed 10 July 1997: Christoph Cremer, Michael Hausmann, Joachim Bradl, Bernhard Schneider Wave field microscope with detection point spread function Currently, a size resolution of 30 ‚Äì 40 nm (approximately 1/16 ‚Äì 1/13 of the wavelength used) is being achieved. In addition, this technology is no longer subjected to the speed limitations of the focusing microscopy so that it becomes possible to undertake 3D analyses of whole cells within short observation times (at the moment around a few seconds). Disambiguation SMI: S = spatially, M = Modulated I= Illumination.  Localization Microscopy SPDM  Also around 1995, Cremer developed and realized new fluorescence based wide field microscopy approaches which had as their goal the improvement of the effective optical resolution (in terms of the smallest detectable distance between two localized objects) down to a fraction of the conventional resolution (spectral precision distance/position determination microscopy, SPDM; Disambiguation SPDM: S = Spectral, P = Precision, D = Distance, M = Microscopy).US patent 6,424,421, filed 23 December 1996: Christoph Cremer, Michael Hausmann, Joachim Bradl, Bernd Rinke Method and devices for measuring distances between object structures  Localization Microscopy SPDMphymod  With this method, it is possible to use conventional, well established and inexpensive fluorescent dyes, standard like GFP, RFP, YFP, Alexa 488, Alexa 568, Alexa 647, Cy2, Cy3, Atto 488 and fluorescein.

In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, however, virtual incumbency was also determined less formally, either by the policies of the actual candidates or the state of the polls. 2008 U.S. presidential election Kevin Hassett used the idea in its traditional sense when discussing Ray Fair's model, which ties the incumbent's party to the current state of the economy. In 2008, however, argued Hassett, :\\"it may not be possible for the Democrats to portray the Republican candidate, who has taken his own principled stands on any number of issues throughout the past seven years, as a virtual incumbent.

He is significant due to his mention in John Bosco's memoirs for having assisted Bosco greatly in becoming a priest himself.  Biography  Little to nothing is known concerning Giovanni Calosso's youth. Later in his life, he graduated from the University of Turin with a degree in theology, in 1782. Nine years later, in 1791, he became the priest for the town of Bruino. After 22 years in that role, in 1813, he left his parish in order to deal with his declining health. He became a guest of his brother, and the priest of the town Berzano di San Pietro. Later, in his 70th year, in 1829, he relocated and became Murialdo's chaplain. It was there, in Murialdo, that he met young John Bosco. He was impressed by the youth's ability to memorize and recite that day's sermon, so much so that he decided to instruct Bosco personally, so that Bosco could become a priest as he wished. One year later, on November 21, 1830, Giovanni Calosso was struck by apoplexy while Bosco was out on an errand. On his death bed, he asked to see Bosco one last time. Bosco ran to Calosso's house, where, just before he died, unable to speak because of the pain, Calosso gave Bosco the key to a drawer, telling him that what it contained was for him, and him alone. At the funeral, Bosco gave the key to Calosso's grandnephews. Contained within the safe was six thousand lira, which Bosco refused to accept, overcome with the loss of his father-figure.

Background Thayre was born in London on 20 October 1894. He lived in Littlehampton, Sussex, before the war. World War I service Thayre learned to fly as a civilian, being granted Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate No. 1478 on 29 July 1915, after soloing a Maurice Farman biplane at the Military School at Brooklands, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant (on probation) in the Royal Flying Corps the same day. On completion of his military flight training he was appointed a flying officer on 29 December 1915, and was confirmed in his rank on 12 January 1916. Thayre first flew operationally with No. 16 Squadron RFC in France, in B.E.2 two-seater aircraft, gaining his first victory on 18 March 1916 when his observer, Lieutenant C. R. Davidson, shot down an attacking German Fokker E.III fighter aircraft. On 30 April he received a mention in despatches for his \\"gallant and distinguished conduct in the field\\" from General Douglas Haig, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in France. On 10 July, Thayre was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain, and on 1 September, he was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant. thumb Thayre was later posted to No. 20 Squadron, flying F.E.2d aircraft. He teamed up with Francis Cubbon, with whom he claimed two victories on 29 April 1917. On 1 May, the duo shot down an Albatros two-seater of FA 6, killing its crew of two, while on 3 May 1917 Thayre and Cubbon engaged twenty-six Albatros D.III scouts, claiming two enemy aircraft shot down. At last, having exhausted their machine gun ammunition in that fight, Thayre and Cubbon used their automatic pistols as weapons of last resort. They would score fifteen victories together during the course of May 1917. When Britain's leading ace, Albert Ball crashed to his death on 7 May, Thayre found himself lagging only his own gunner, Cubbon, and Billy Bishop in the ace race of the Royal Flying Corps. Killed in action On 7 June, Thayre and Cubbon shot down and killed the five-victory ace Leutnant Weissner of Jasta 18. On 9 June 1917, their F.E.2d aircraft, No. A6430, received a direct hit from anti-aircraft fire from K Flak Battery 60 near Warneton and both men were killed. The nineteen victories they shared included five D.IIIs shot down in flames, eleven destroyed, an Albatros C reconnaissance two-seater set afire, and another destroyed. Another D.III was driven down out of control. To that, Thayre added his victory with Davidson‚Äîa Fokker E.III fighter destroyed. Along with his gunner Cubbon, Thayre was posthumously awarded the Military Cross, and a Bar in lieu of a second award, on 18 July 1917.

The term was also used to name Alfaskop AB, a listed Swedish IT services company., that filed for bankruptcy in 2001. History SRT, owned by the ITT Corporation during the 1960s, specialised in Air Traffic Control systems and military radar systems. In 1971, SRT provided the core technology for Stansaab AS, a joint venture with Saab and the state-owned Swedish Development Company. The company‚Äôs primary focus was systems for real-time data applied to commercial and aviation applications. To this was added the data terminal operations of Facit in 1972. The Alfaskop terminals quickly gained a foothold in the market for airline reservations with 1,000 in use at Scandinavian Airlines alone. In 1978, Stansaab was merged with the Data Saab division of Saab to form Datasaab. In 1981, Ericsson, believing that growth in telecoms would be lower than that in IT, purchased Datasaab and integrated it with two of its own divisions to form Ericsson Information Systems (EIS). Accurately predicting convergence between telephony and data technologies, EIS instructed the Alfaskop group to begin working on a design for Ericsson's first PC ‚Äì the EPC, which was released 16 months later in 1984. Following market difficulties in the United States, particularly with a disappointing launch of its PC, Ericsson decided to abandon its \\"paperless office\\" strategy. In 1988, the division was sold to Nokia and later to ICL in 1990. The final act was its sale by ICL to Wyse Technology who eventually wound down manufacturing. The Alfaskop range Due to its work for the aviation industry, one of SRT‚Äôs core competencies was the display of radar images. It was this expertise that led to the development of the Alfaskop terminal, which was inspired by the launch of IBM's range of display terminals. These terminals made interaction with computers much easier than with earlier punched card or paper tape interfaces. The alphanumeric, 80 character, 24 line terminal quickly became a standard. The Alfaskop terminals were designed to be pin compatible with the IBM equipment. The Alfaskop 3100, the first model, was designed to compete with the IBM 2260, while the later 3500 was developed in response to the IBM 3270. There followed a refreshed 3500 called System 37 followed by a System 41 ‚Äì a new design.The 3500 series were also produced in Poland under the name MERA 7900. The first Ericsson PC - the EPC, was released at the CeBit fair in Hanover in 1984. The Ericsson Portable PC followed a year later. In subsequent years, with the growth in demand for IBM-compatible PCs, several Alfaskop PC models were released. While Ericsson had tried to build its own brand in the PC business, Nokia was willing to trade on the Alfaskop name. By 1989, they were showing the ‚ÄúAlfaskop Workgroup System‚Äù comprising 80386-based servers, 80286-based desktops and ethernet or token ring networking. Office software included the X400-compatible Alfaskop Mail, WordPerfect and Lotus Freelance. The systems were offered with either MS-DOS or OS/2. Commercial Success The Alfaskop terminals enjoyed considerable success, even outselling IBM in some markets, particularly in Sweden. By the early 1980s the company had accumulated profits of about one billion kronor. Customers included airlines, newspapers, police, councils and telecommunications companies. A key benefit of the terminals was that they were IBM compatible but cost less. This meant discounts for volume customers made the terminals attractive. Reflecting the profit contribution made by Alfaskop (other product ranges at Stansaab/Datasaab were losing money), Ericsson invested 40 million kronor in the manufacturing facility at J√§rfalla outside Stockholm. Ericsson had predicted that their Eritex workstation comprising a telex and data terminal would take over from Alfaskop but demand continued with 100,000 units sold by 1983 with annual sales climbing above 25,000. Eritex was retired by the mid-1980s. Deliveries of Alfaskop continued through the Nokia years and by the time production ceased, more than 900 000 units had been shipped. Alfaskop AB From 1990, Nokia Data encouraged the development of several franchise partners to drive sales of PCs and network technologies. From 1994 these companies were co-operating closely and delivering network technologies, Microsoft solutions, and systems integration. In 1995, these companies were merged to form Alfaskop AB. In 1997, the company was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. By 2000, Alfaskop had 660 employees with 18 offices in Sweden. However, by 2001, the company was bankrupt and its remaining 400 employees were laid off. Business Wire reported that about half of the employees found employment at Meteorit AB, another IT consultancy.

He was born at Chilvers Coton near Nuneaton, Warwickshire and worked in the neighbouring village of Griff. In 1717, he published an engraving of the Newcomen engine erected there in 1714 by Thomas Newcomen. In 1718 he erected one at Oxclose colliery at Washington, County Durham. By measuring the work done by the Griff engine, he was able to compile a table of quantity of water that could be raised by an engine with a six-foot stroke working at 16 strokes per minute. He published this table in The Ladies' Diary which he edited at the time. On his return to his native county he made a plane table and prepared a map of the county, which was published in 1728 at a scale of one inch to one mile. He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1720 and contributed four papers to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, including a description of his plane table, and of George Sorocold's waterworks at London Bridge.Also Desaguliers, 436-441. His interest in the working of the Griff engine brought him into contact with J. T. Desaguliers and contributed details and illustrations of hydraulic machines for the second volume of the latter's Course of Experimental Philosophy, eventually published in 1744. This included a description by Beighton of an overshot mill, with an engraving of a corn mill by the abbey in Nuneaton. This is the earliest illustration of a mill where a single waterwheel drove more than one set of machinery.Desaguliers, 449-453. His outstanding county map of Warwickshire was one of the first soundly based on trigonometrical survey methods. A remarkably wide range of features is depicted on the map, reflecting the whole life and economy of the county: Parish churches, chapels, depopulated places, seats of nobility, chases, parks, king's houses, monasteries, castles, Roman ways, etc. Beighton's map was well ahead of its time.

The battle took place at the lava field of Harrat Waqim in the northeastern outskirts of Medina on 26 August 683. The elite factions of Medina disapproved of the hereditary succession of Yazid, unprecedented in Islamic history until that point, resented the caliph's impious lifestyle, and chafed under Umayyad economic policies. After declaring their rebellion, they besieged the Umayyad clan resident in Medina and dug a defensive trench around the city. The expeditionary force sent by Yazid together with the local Umayyads, who had since been released from the siege, encamped at Harrat Waqim where they were confronted by the rebels. Despite an initial advantage, the Medinese were routed as a result of the defection of one of their factions, which enabled Umayyad horsemen led by Marwan ibn al-Hakam to attack them from the rear. Afterward, the army pillaged Medina for three days, though accounts of the plunder vary considerably. The Syrian army proceeded to besiege the rebel leader Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr in Mecca, though Ibn Uqba, who was maligned in Muslim traditional sources for his role in Medina's plunder, died en route. The Battle of al-Harra is described as one of the Umayyads' \\"major\\" crimes by the traditional sources. Location Basaltic stony ground of the eastern desert of modern Jordan, characteristic of the wider region of ·∏•arras that extend from the Hauran into western Arabia The location of the battle was in a lava field known as Harrat Waqim, which straddles the eastern outskirts of Medina in the Hejaz (western Arabia). It was named after the Waqim fortress of the Banu Qurayza tribe that had been resident in the area during the pre- Islamic period and was alternatively known as Harrat Bani Qurayza or Harrat Zuhra. It formed part of the vast geological system of ·∏•arras (basaltic deserts) which spanned the region east of the Hauran in Syria southward to Medina's environs. As a result of the fame of the battle, Harrat Waqim was thenceforth referred to in Muslim sources as \\"the Harra\\". Background The hereditary succession of the Umayyad caliph Mu'awiya I's son Yazid I in 680 had been unprecedented act in Islamic history and was a point of contention among the people of Medina, particularly the eminent Muslim leaders of the Hejaz. One of them, Husayn, a son of Caliph Ali () and grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, left Medina to lead a revolt against Yazid in Iraq, but was slain alongside his entire band of about seventy followers at the Battle of Karbala by the forces of the Umayyad governor Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad; Yazid had the head of Husayn put on display in Damascus. Reports of impious behavior by Yazid, including entertainment by singing girls and a pet monkey contributed to prevailing attitudes in Medina of his unsuitability as caliph. The Medinese consisted of the Ansar (native Medinese who had hosted and allied with Muhammad after his emigration from Mecca in 622) and the Muhajirun (Muhammad's early supporters who had emigrated with him). The Muhajirun were dominated by the Quraysh, the tribe to which Muhammad, Ali and the Umayyads belonged. At the time of the opposition to Yazid, the Medinese were mostly the children of the two factions, i.e. Islam's first military generation, and felt threatened at the potential loss of the inherited military pensions brought about by Umayyad fiscal reforms; the reforms called for pensions to be given only in exchange for direct military service. To reconcile with the Medinese, Yazid requested that they send a delegation to his court in Damascus. The governor of Medina, Yazid's cousin Uthman ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Sufyan, organized the Medinese embassy to Damascus. Yazid attempted to win over the delegates by lavishing them with gifts and money. This proved fruitless when the delegates returned and incited the people of Medina with accounts detailing Yazid's scandalous lifestyle. The most vociferous critic among the delegates was Abd Allah ibn Hanzala. He declared that he and his sons would fight against Yazid should others not help him and though he was respected by Yazid, he would use the gifts the latter gave him against the caliph. Meanwhile, Abd Allah ibn al- Zubayr, a grandson of the first caliph Abu Bakr (), had taken control of Mecca in September 683, established his headquarters in the Ka'aba and allied with Ibn Hanzala in opposition to Yazid. =Prelude= Uthman ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Sufyan was unable to control the growing opposition to Umayyad rule. According to the early Muslim historian al-Mada'ini (d. 843), the inaugurating act of rebellion by the Medinese occurred during a gathering in the mosque where the attendees each tossed an article of clothing, such as a turban or a shoe, an Arab custom symbolizing a severing of ties, to renounce their allegiance to Yazid. According to another early Muslim historian Abu Mikhnaf (d. 774), the first act of rebellion by the Medinese was giving allegiance to Ibn Hanzala. Afterward, they assaulted the Umayyads and their supporters in the city, together about 1,000-strong, who fled to the quarter of their senior elder, Marwan ibn al-Hakam. Marwan sent urgent requests for assistance from Yazid, who dispatched a 4,000 to 12,000-strong, well-equipped army of Syrian Arab tribesmen, dominated by the Banu Kalb. The expeditionary force was sent to suppress the opposition from both the Medinese and Ibn al-Zubayr. As an incentive to the troops, who anticipated an arduous campaign ahead, each soldier was paid 100 dirhams over their regular stipend. Yazid's initial choice for the commander of this force, the Umayyad Amr ibn Sa'id ibn al-As, refused the position out of a principle not to shed the blood of his fellow Quraysh, while Ubayd Allah, still reeling from the fallout from his role in the death of Husayn, also refused. Instead, the loyal, elderly, non-Qurayshi veteran Muslim ibn Uqba was given the command. According to the historian al- Ya'qubi (d. 897), Ibn Uqba's forces were composed of equal numbers of troops from the five junds (armies) of Syria: Rawh ibn Zinba al-Judhami led the men of Palestine, Hubaysh ibn Dulja al-Qayni led the men of Jordan, Abd Allah ibn Mas'ada al-Fazari led the men of Damascus, Husayn ibn Numayr al-Sakuni led the men of Homs and Zufar ibn al-Harith al-Kilabi led the men of Qinnasrin. Upon hearing of the Syrian advance, the Medinese reinforced the siege against the Umayyads of Medina, before allowing them to leave after they gave oaths not to assist the incoming army. On their way to Syria, the exiled Umayyads encountered Ibn Uqba's army in the Wadi al-Qura region between Syria and Medina. Ibn Uqba's inquiries about Medina's defenses were rebuffed by most of the Umayyads, some of whom continued on their way north, but Marwan's son Abd al-Malik cooperated and offered valuable intelligence. Under Marwan's leadership, most of the exiles joined the expedition. In Medina, the defenders, numbering about 2,000 men, dug a trench to protect a vulnerable northern corner of the city and divided themselves into four units, two of which were commanded by members of the Quraysh, one by a member of the Banu Ashja and the other by Ibn Hanzala of the Ansar. For three days starting on 23 August Ibn Uqba attempted negotiations with the Medinese leaders. He appealed for unity and promised two annual payments to the Medinese from Yazid and a significant price reduction of corn. According to the historian Laura Veccia Vaglieri, this indicates that economic concerns contributed to the Medinese opposition of the Umayyads. Battle Plan of Medina in the early 19th century The negotiations between Ibn Uqba and the Medinese faltered, and clashes ensued. The Medinese horsemen marched against Ibn Uqba in the Harra, and may have advanced as far as Ibn Uqba's litter, from which he commanded his troops. Upon their approach, Ibn Uqba confronted them on horseback and actively participated in the fighting. The Medinese gained an early advantage, but were ultimately overtaken by the Syrians and several Ansari and Qurayshi notables were slain, including Ibn Hanzala, eight of his sons and a handful of other men from the Medinese elite. The medieval Arab historians Wahb ibn Jarir (d. 822) and al-Samhudi (d. 1533) held that Medinese lines were compromised by the defection of the Banu Haritha, who gave Marwan and his horsemen access through their quarter in Medina, enabling them to assault the Medinese at al- Harra from the rear. The Quraysh, led by Abd Allah ibn Muti al-Adawi, fled the battlefield and headed for safety to Ibn al-Zubayr in Mecca. According to the early Muslim source al-Waqidi (d. 747), the battle concluded on 26 August 683. Aftermath Conflicting accounts abound regarding the aftermath of the Syrian victory. According to Abu Mikhnaf and al-Samhudi, Ibn Uqba gave his troops free rein to pillage Medina for three days. The number of Medinese casualties incurred during the battle and immediate aftermath range from 180 to 700 members of the Ansar and Quraysh, and 4,000 to 10,000 other Medinese. Al-Samhudi further claimed that as a result of the alleged rape of Medinese women by Ibn Uqba's troops, 1,000 illegitimate children were later born by them as a result. The account of early Arab historian Awana ibn al-Hakam (d. 764) describes a more orderly capture, in which Ibn Uqba summoned the notables of Medina to give allegiance to Yazid at the Quba Mosque and used the occasion to execute several prominent leaders of the opposition movement, including a number from the Quraysh and Ma'qil ibn Sinan al-Ashja'i. The latter had been a close friend and belonged to the same Ghatafan tribal grouping as Ibn Uqba, but was nonetheless executed for his disavowal of Yazid. A son of Caliph Uthman (), a member of the Umayyad clan, had his beard cut as punishment for suspected collusion with the Medinese, though Ali ibn al-Husayn, a grandson of Caliph Ali, was well-treated on the personal instructions of Yazid. Wahb ibn Jarir likewise did not make note of a three-day plunder of Medina and Wellhausen doubts that it occurred. The accounts of Abu Mikhnaf and Awana agree that following the ordering of affairs in Medina, Ibn Uqba left to subdue Ibn al-Zubayr in Mecca, but fell ill and died on the way in al- Mushallal. As ordered by Yazid, he left as second-in-command Husayn ibn Numayr al-Sakuni, who proceeded to besiege Mecca in September. The alleged cruelty against the townspeople of Medina by the Umayyad army became a cause c√©l√®bre that was invoked by future generations. Ibn Uqba was thenceforth known as \\"Musrif\\", a play on his name \\"Muslim\\" that meant \\"he who exceeds all bounds of propriety\\". The historian Michael Lecker considers the reports of Syrian atrocities in Medina as \\"undeniably anti-Umayyad and probably exaggerated\\". Moreover, Wellhausen dismisses the depiction by later Muslim and western sources of Ibn Uqba as a brutal heathen with a deep hatred for Islam, in general, and the people of Medina, in particular, as a falsity that developed over time and is unsupported by the early and more credible Muslim sources. In Wellhausen's assessment, the suppression of the Medinese revolt did not render a major decline to the city's political status; this had already been precipitated by the assassination of Caliph Uthman, the aftermath of which marked Medina's end as the capital of the nascent Muslim state. The city continued to be a center for religious scholarship, Arab high culture and a redoubt for poets and singers. Vaglieri counters Wellhausen's doubts about the extent of the army's pillage, asserting that the \\"[traditional Muslim] sources are unanimous on this point\\".

He had several roles within the club from the 1890s to the 1940s, most notably putting them in contact with Matt Busby in 1945; Busby would go on to manage the club for 25 years. Biography =Early years= A family of Italian gelato purveyors, Louis Rocca (senior) and his wife Mary, emigrated to England in the early 1870s and established an ice cream business at 64 Rochdale Road in the Newton Heath district of Manchester. Their son, Louis Rocca (junior), was born in Manchester between September and December 1882. He began his association with Manchester United (then known as Newton Heath F.C.) in the 1890s when he got a job as a tea boy at the club's Bank Street ground. He even played for the club's reserve team on a couple of occasions. =Manchester United= In 1902, the club was in severe financial difficulty but was saved at the 11th hour by local brewer John Henry Davies. He changed the club's colours from green and gold halves to red and white, but decided it would be more appropriate to convene a meeting of the club's fans, directors and other interested parties to determine a new name for the club. Rocca attended the meeting on 26 April 1902 and claims that, after hearing other people's suggestions of \\"Manchester Celtic\\" and \\"Manchester Central\\" be rejected for sounding \\"too Scottish\\" and \\"too industrial,\\"Barnes et al.; p.9 he suggested the name \\"Manchester United.\\" There is no documentary evidence that Rocca was actually the one to suggest the name \\"Manchester United,\\"White, p. 26. \\"Everyone present, however, agreed that a nineteen-year-old supporter called Louis Rocca had a good idea when he proposed Manchester United. Or at least that was the tale Rocca dined out on for the next half century. There is no documentary proof that the man who went on to do every job with the club, from chief scout to temporary manager, actually conjured up the name or merely picked up a cry from the crowd. But no matter, Manchester United it was.\\" but Rocca maintained that Manchester United was his brainchild for the rest of his life.White, Jim; p.26 In 1903 Louis married Mary Emily Wrenshall and by 1911 he had taken over the family business and was living in Oldham Road in Manchester with his wife and four children. By the time of his mother's death in 1924, Louis was still managing the family ice cream and confectionery business and he was father to nine children. =Assistant manager and James Gibson= Over the years, Rocca came to be the club's chief \\"fixer\\" ‚Äì if the club needed anything done, Rocca was the man for the job ‚Äì until, in 1931, it was decided that he ought to be given some level of responsibility over the affairs of the team. With Herbert Bamlett's tenure as manager over, club secretary Walter Crickmer stepped into the breach as manager, with Rocca as his assistant. However, the club was yet again in financial turmoil at the time, and Rocca set about finding a new investor. The man he turned to was James W. Gibson, a partner in the clothing firm Briggs, Jones and Gibson,White, Jim; p.54 who had made their money in the manufacture of Army uniforms. As well as being an entrepreneur, Gibson was a fiercely proud Mancunian and unwilling to see such an integral part of the city's culture go under, so when club secretary Walter Crickmer visited Gibson at his Cheshire mansion, it didn't take much persuasion to convince Gibson to invest ¬£2,000 in the club. Gibson then promised extra funds if other investors would match his ¬£2,000 investment.White, Jim; pp.54‚Äì55 =Chief scout= One of the legacies of the Gibson administration at Manchester United was the Manchester United Junior Athletic Club (MUJAC). Set up at the behest of the supporters', the MUJAC was charged with bringing the best young players in the local area to Manchester United, with the aim of eventually filling the first team with local talent. Rocca was appointed as the MUJAC's chief scout, and, through his connections to the Manchester Catholic Sportsman's Club, he appointed a network of scouts from the Catholic Church. The two names that Rocca's scouting system is best known for discovering are Johnny Carey and Stan Pearson, and both go to show the breadth of the club's scouting network. Pearson was a local boy who Rocca spotted playing for Adelphi Lads' Club as a 16-year-old before signing for the club as an amateur on 1 December 1935,White, John D. T.; p.317 while Carey was a native of Dublin. Rocca had actually intended to scout another player when he went over to Ireland, but he was so impressed with Carey's air of authority that he immediately signed him for ¬£250.Barnes et al.; p.74 =Busby= In 1932, United appointed Scott Duncan as manager, with Crickmer and Rocca reverting to their previous roles. However, Duncan resigned in 1937, and the two backroom men stepped into the breach again. They were in charge for two seasons before the outbreak of the Second World War and the suspension of all football in Britain. By the end of the war, the United board decided that a new permanent manager should be installed, and Rocca knew just the man, telling the board to \\"leave it to [him]\\".White, Jim; pp.61‚Äì62 In 1930, Rocca had attempted to sign Manchester City wing-half Matt Busby for United, but the club was unable to pay the ¬£150 transfer fee.White, Jim; p.62 Nevertheless, Rocca and Busby stayed in touch, both being members of the Manchester Catholic Sportsman's Club, and when Rocca learned that Busby had been offered the manager's job at his then-club, Liverpool, he immediately wrote Busby a letter (addressed to his army regiment, in case it was intercepted by the Liverpool management) informing him of the job opportunity at United. Busby turned up at James Gibson's Trafford Park factory in February 1945 with demands for unprecedented control over the football team, but Rocca reassured his chairman that the Scot was the right man for the job and the contract was signed that day. =Later years, death and legacy= In the first few years after Busby's appointment as manager, the Manchester United team was almost entirely composed of players discovered by Rocca and his scouting system. Then, in 1948, Rocca had the ultimate honour bestowed upon him as his prot√©g√©s won the FA Cup. In the team that day, Crompton, Carey, Aston, Anderson, Morris, Pearson and Mitten had all come through the youth system. However, this was to be his last major contribution to the club, as he died in 1950, bringing an association with the club of more than 50 years to an end.Dunphy; p.147 His legacy would continue, though, through Joe Armstrong, the man appointed as Rocca's replacement in the role of chief scout. Like Rocca, Armstrong would seek out the best young players in the Manchester area, and even further afield as the North East of England, where he discovered a 15-year-old Bobby Charlton in 1953.Dunphy; pp.181‚Äì182 In 2005, Rocca was honoured with the naming of an annual football match after him. The match was originally to be played between Salford Boys and Manchester Boys, but Manchester Boys were uninterested and Glasgow Boys were chosen as the opposition for the Salford side, in recognition of the ties between the cities of Manchester and Glasgow. The match, named \\"The Louis Rocca Trophy\\", was conceived by Salford-based artist Harold Riley, who had himself been a player for Salford Boys and a discovery of Rocca's for Manchester United, and Manchester-based restaurateur Bruno Cabrelli. Rocca was chosen as the inspiration for the match because, according to Riley, \\"one person never mentioned when people talk about United's history is Louis Rocca\\". Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson convinced Nike to provide both teams with kits for the occasion. Two matches were played on the inaugural occasion, one for the senior teams of both clubs and one for the juniors, with Glasgow Boys winning both; they won the senior match 1‚Äì0 and the junior match 5‚Äì4.

Passions in religion and philosophy have a different connotation from the popular concept of passion which is generally seen as a positive emotion. The philosophical notion of passion, in contrast, is identified with innate or biologically driven emotional states regarded in ancient philosophies and the great religions as being the basis for deadly sins and seen as leading to various social and spiritual ills such as unstable relationships, broken marriages, lack of social integration, psychological disorders and other problems. In the philosophical tradition of the west passion is often placed in opposition to reason. Reason is advocated in the control of passion, something seen as desirable and necessary for the development of a mature, civilized human being. This is achieved by the cultivation of virtue. Four virtues in particular have long been seen as of especial value in this regard. The majority of philosophies and religions advocate at the very least tempering the passions to keep them within acceptable bounds. However most of the great religions recommend both the restraint and the transformation of the passions to the point where they no longer arise. This is true of Christianity, Jainism, Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism. The institution of the monastery within various religions is a means by which human beings may temporarily or permanently seclude themselves from circumstances exacerbating the arising of passion and provide a supportive environment for doing spiritual work. Contemporary philosopher Roberto Mangabeira Unger has developed a view of the passions that disassociates them from human nature, and instead gives them a formless life that serve in our noninstrumental dealings with each other. Rather than the guiding force behind our relations with the world, they organize and are organized around the need and danger that is at the heart of our relations with each other. In this way, Unger rejects the traditional view of the passions as something counter to reason and which are associated with certain expressions, rather he sees them at the service of reason and their expression formed within certain contexts. Background The subject of the passions has long been a consideration in Western philosophy. According to European philosopher Michel Meyer, they have aroused harsh judgments as the representation of a force of excess and lawlessness in humanity that produces troubling, confusing paradoxes. Meyer sees philosophers as having treated the passions as a given expression of human nature, leaving the question of whether the passions \\"torture people because it blinds them, or, on the contrary, does it permit them to apprehend who and what we really are?\\"Michel Meyer, Philosophy and the Passions, a translation of Le Philosophe et les passions *(Livre de poche), Penn State Press, 2000. Preface, introduction and translation by Robert F. Barsky, website Spinoza The seventeenth century Dutch philosopher Spinoza contrasted \\"action\\" with \\"passion,\\" as well as the state of being \\"active\\" with the state of being \\"passive.\\" A passion, in his view, happened when external events affect us partially such that we have confused ideas about these events and their causes. A \\"passive\\" state is when we experience an emotion which Spinoza regarded as a \\"passivity of the soul.\\" The body's power is increased or diminished. Emotions are bodily changes plus ideas about these changes which can help or hurt a human. It happens when the bodily changes we experience are caused primarily by external forces or by a mix of external and internal forces. Spinoza argued that it was much better for the individual himself to be the only adequate cause of bodily changes, and to act based on an adequate understanding of causes-and-effects with ideas of these changes logically related to each other and to reality. When this happened the person is \\"active,\\" and Spinoza described the ideas as adequate. But most of the time, this does not happen, and Spinoza, along with Freud, saw emotions as more powerful than reason. Spinoza tried to live the life of reason which he advocated.

It is a direct sequel to The Bund, also produced and released by TVB earlier in the same year. A sequel, The Bund III, was released by TVB later that year. Plot The story continues from after Hui Man-keung's death in The Bund. Hui's best friend, Ting Lik, now controls the Shanghai triad world and he seeks to avenge Hui. Ting sends Chan Cheung-kwai to hunt down those responsible for murdering Hui, which leads to a series of killings. At the same time, Ting is depressed after receiving news that his lover, Ching-ching, has become a nun. He decides to find another girlfriend, whom he has no romantic feelings for, just to cheer his mother up. By coincidence, Ting meets Chu Yin-yin and he falls in love with her. Just as their relationship is developing well, a gentlemanly and wealthy businessman named Tik Wan-chi appears and Yin-yin becomes attracted to Tik. The three of them are drawn into a complex love triangle. Actually, Tik's immense wealth comes from secret financial support by the Japanese. Tik invites Ting to become his business partner and Ting reaps great rewards from their partnership. However, Tik's goal is to pave a path for the Japanese to take control of Shanghai. Ting eventually learns of Tik's background after cooperating with him for some time. He is also shocked to discover that Tik is actually the mastermind behind Hui's assassination. Ting enters a dilemma on whether to kill Tik. He intends to kill Tik to avenge his friend and prevent the Japanese from taking over Shanghai. However, he is also hesitant when he sees that Yin-yin truly loves Tik and when he feels that he does not want to lose Tik as a business partner. Eventually, Ting decides to turn against Tik to uphold justice and his decision will stir up big trouble in Shanghai.

Menelaws achieved success in the first two decades of the 19th century as the designer of town and country residences and parks of Razumovsky and Stroganov families, and later worked for emperor Alexander I, specializing in Gothic Revival architecture. From 1825 to 1831 Menelaws, then in his seventies, became the first house architect of Nicholas I and de facto the leading architect of the Empire.Kuznetsov, p. 226 Except for this final, properly evidenced, stage, life story of Adam Menelaws remains scarcely documented and has been reconstructed by biographers based on sketchy archive data and circumstantial evidence;Kuznetsov, p. 212 Menelaws still \\"belongs to the category of almost unknown\\".Cross, 1997 p. 297 Biography The Scottish origin of Menelaws was confirmed by the architect himself to A. B. Granville, an English traveler who published a report of his journey in London in 1828. There is no other reliable evidence of his early years, education and experience prior to arriving in Russia in 1784. Members of Menelaws family were construction contractors in Argyll; Howard ColvinColvin 1995 and Dmitry ShvidkovskyShvidkovsky 1992 suggest that Adam Menelaws belonged to the same family, but this opinion has not been reliably confirmed by archive research. Historians split over the year of his birth: a 1784 immigration record suggests that he arrived in Russia at the age of 35, i.e. born in or around 1748, while the funeral records of the English church in Saint Petersburg state the year of his birth as 1756.William Heste's immigration and death records contradict in the same fashion, with a span of 10 years. In 1803 Menelaws asserted that he hails from a noble English family, but Russian authorities refused to honour his claim.Kuznetsov, p. 227 In early 1780s Charles Cameron, an architect employed by Catherine II since 1779, published a job offer in Edinburgh Evening News, signed Catherine of Russia, inviting skilled construction workers to join his Tsarskoye Selo project. 73 craftsmen, including Adam Menelaws, agreed to move to Russia (many took their families with them), causing a futile protest of the Foreign Office.Kuznetsov, p. 213 All were sufficiently qualified to become professional architects or at least architect's trainees in Russia; Cameron ranked Menelaws as the one of two best stonemasons - the \\"vaulting master\\".Kuznetsov, p. 215 Menelaws signed for a three-year contract to build the Cold Baths near Saint Petersburg, agreeing also to train a class of Russian craftsmen. Apparently the number of Scottish professionals was too big for Cameron, and one year later Menelaws left him and joined the service of Nikolay Lvov. Lvov, an amateur composer, poet and Palladian architect was at that time aide to statesman Alexander Bezborodko. Historians divide over his role in Menelaws career: tradition held it that Lvov promoted Menelaws, introducing him to the Crown projects, while later researchers assert that, on the contrary, Lvov's influence slowed down Menelaws career. Instead of architecture, in May 1785 Lvov engaged Menelaws and William Heste in search for coal fossils (at that time Russian metallurgy was dependent on either charcoal or imports from England and Wales). In 1786 Menelaws found commercial-grade (\\"not inferior to that of Newcastle\\") coal near Borovichi;Cross, 1997 p. 298 by 1790 the coal research team increased to 10 professionals. It is quite likely, however, that Lvov used the state- sponsored quest for coal as a cover to extract a talented architect for his own use: in 1785‚Äì1794 Menelaws was regularly involved in Lvov's construction projects.Kuznetsov, p. 216 Another Scot, Walter Irving, was employed by Lvov to construct his idealist Sun Temple, a country estate in Tver Oblast; its circular arcade, resembling the henges of Britain, was later recreated in Menelaws' own designs. The rotunda motive, common to Menelaws later works, was most likely inspired by Lvov.Kuznetsov, p. 219 Menelaws married Elizabeth Cave in 1792; the ceremony was attended by Lvov, Alexey Olenin (president of the Imperial Academy of Arts) and numerous members of the English and Scottish diaspora. In 1795 Menelaws began gradually separating from Lvov's service after the construction of the Saint Joseph cathedral in Mahilyow, but the two remained in contact until Lvov's sudden death in 1803. Meanwhile, Menelaws remained a Russian state servant of a small rank since his arrival. After Lvov's death he attempted to retire immediately, but, faced with refusal in pension benefits, preferred to remain in service until 1806.Cross, 1997 p. 300 According to Anthony Cross, \\"the late burgeoning of Menelaws talent\\" probably occurred only after Lvov' death, during his work for the Razumovsky family. The Chapel in Tsarskoye Selo provided living quarters to the chaplain of Nicholas I In the 19th century Menelaws created a string of English gardens for the Razumovskys; the best known, in Gorenki (present-day Balashikha),Razumovskys sold Gorenki in 1818; new owners converted the estate to a textile mill and by 1860 Menelaws' gardens were completely destroyed. The neoclassical palace was restored in 1910s, converted to a sanatorium in 1920s and survives in badly ruined shape. was included in John Claudius Loudon's An Encyclopedia of Gardening for its landscaping and a private botanical garden.Kuznetsov, p. 217Hayden, p. 184 Historians split on the issue whether Gorenki was designed primarily by Menelaws or by Lvov. In 1801‚Äì1802 Menelaws designed and built the Razumovsky Palace in Basmanny District of Moscow;Attribution to Menelaws alone is a recent trend (e.g. Kuznetsov, p. 219); earlier, the palace was attributed to Lvov or Matvey Kazakov. the palace was destroyed by the Fire of 1812 and later reconstructed by Afanasy Grigoriev. Another large park, Stroganov's Maryino, was laid down near Saint Peterburg in 1813. All these landscaping projects perished by the end of 19th century. Menelaws park designs always employed a Gothic ruin as a visual anchor. Menelaws was instrumental in operations of the Maryino school established by the Golitsyns in 1819, teaching the peasants the craft of cob construction. Introduction of cob technology in Russia is usually credited to Lvov, but may also be linked directly to Menelaws's Scottish experience.Kuznetsov, p. 218-219 Dmitry Shvidkovsky suggested that Menelaws, not Cameron, was the designer of the Razumovsky palace in Baturin, but other historians reject this opinion. In the 1810s Alexander I invited Menelaws to redesign the Alexander's Park in Tsarskoye Selo, starting with an old dilapidated menagerie. The new plan proposed by Menelaws created an illusion of a completely novel design, yet carefully preserved the structure of a regular park shaped in the previous century; according to Lvov, Menelaws \\"merged the art of Kent and Le N√¥tre\\".Kuznetsov, p. 220 Menelaws designed and built 12 structures,Cross, 1997 p. 303 including the Egyptian Gates and three park pavilions: the large Arsenal (1819‚Äì1834) built on the site of Mon Bijou built by Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli in 1750s, the White Tower (1821‚Äì1827), a house for the young Grand Dukes and the Chapel (1825‚Äì1828), a folly providing living quarter to the palace chaplain. Use of an eclectic, pan- European romanticism was justified as a symbol of the New Europe shaped at the Congress of Vienna, but was also a sign of Alexander's turn to mysticism. Alexander's Park was occupied by Nicholas I, then heir presumptive, who also leaned to eclecticism and medieval legacy, as would be evidenced later by his reign.Kuznetsov, p. 221‚Äì222 The Cottage in Alexandria Park, Petergof. Nicholas became Menelaws' \\"most appreciative patron who provided him with the opportunity at a very advanced stage of life\\".Cross, 1997 p. 305 Indeed, his most important commission, the Alexandria Park, was started when the architect was at least around 70 years old. Shortly before his death in 1824, Alexander I granted a lot of land on the coast of Gulf of Finland, east of Petergof, to Nicholas I.Hayden, p. 160 The new Alexandria Park, commissioned to Menelaws, became the last, and best preserved of the architect's projects. The work started with landscaping the territory and digging two large artificial pools; after Alexander's death, Nicholas commissioned Menelaws to build his summer residence, the asymmetrical Cottage. Externally, it was more English than Gothic; Gothic influence was more obvious in the interiors designed by Menelaws.Hayden, p. 161 The park, laid down in English style, featured winding walkways around ponds, and had a Gothic Chapel (private church of the House of Romanov, designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel) as its focal point (it was completed by Ludwig Charlemagne three years after Menelaws' death). It was suggested that Nicholas actually planned to relocate the remains of Alexander Nevsky into the chapel.Kuznetsov, p. 224 The park also had facilities of the lesser rank: an animal sanctuary for old horses retired from the palace service, a farm and a menagerie with llama and elephant pavilions. Elephants lived in Alexandria until 1911 and were allowed to roam free in the summer.Hayden, p. 98 Menelaws died in Saint Petersburg during the cholera epidemic of 1831.

Racing career His first race was in 1949, at a BARC meeting driving a Fiat 1100 special, which he built himself: \\"very neat was Pierpont's (sic) F.I.A.T. 1,100 with aerodynamic but not all-enveloping bodywork, two Amal carburetters, a neat silencer in its straight exhaust pipe and an oil-cooler ahead of the main radiator.\\" He finished seventh in a 3-lap handicap.Motor Sport, September 1949, Pages 351,-353. See also: Crystal Palace Official Programme, National Car Race Meeting, Page 11, 5 September 1964. Pierpoint raced very little after that until 1961. In 1962 he drove in several events including the BRDC Trophy at Silverstone, the Guards Trophy and the Brands Six Hour Race where he finished third in his class alongside Bruce Halford. Also that year, he achieved some success at Hill Climb events. He continued in sports car racing in 1963 and 1964, again in the Guards Trophy. In 1968 he was in the N√ºrburgring 1000 km race in a Ford GT40, but did not finish. Two years in 1968 and 1969 in Denmarks Jyllands-Ringen, with two wins from four races. He was best known for his time driving in the British Saloon Car Championship, with a total of fourteen race wins. In his first year in 1965, he won the Championship for Alan Mann Racing, driving a V8 4.7-litre Ford Mustang: \\"After a struggle throughout 1965 against the Austin Mini-Cooper S of Warwick Banks,..\\" Racing Car Show 1966, Official Catalogue and Guide, Page 11. The championship was won after a protest against the car of Jack Brabham, which was found to have illegal modifications. He raced a Ford Falcon the following year, which was not competitive enough to defend his title. He stuck with the Falcon for another three years. In 1968 he finished fifth on points and in 1969 he finished third in the championship. He spent two more years in the BSCC, but did not come close to winning the title in a Chevrolet Camaro.

Disruption of the normal drainage of lymph leads to fluid accumulation and hypertrophy of soft tissues. It was named by Sir William Osler for William Milroy, a Canadian physician, who described a case in 1892, though it was first described by Rudolf Virchow in 1863. Presentation The most common presentation of Milroy Disease is unilateral lower extremity lymphedema, and may also be accompanied by hydrocele. Males and females may have upslanting toenails, deep creases in the toes, wart-like growths (papillomas), and prominent leg veins. Some individuals develop non-contagious skin infections called cellulitis that can damage the thin tubes that carry lymph fluid (lymphatic vessels). Episodes of cellulitis can cause further swelling in the lower limbs. Genetics This disease is more common in women and an association with the gene FLT4 has been described. FLT4 codes for VEGFR-3, which is implicated in development of the lymphatic system. Milroy's disease is also known as primary or hereditary lymphedema type 1A or early onset lymphedema. It is a very rare disease with only about 200 cases reported in the medical literature. Milroy's disease is an autosomal dominant condition caused by a mutation in the FLT4 gene which encodes of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) gene located on the long arm (q) on chromosome 5 (5q35.3). In contrast to Milroy's disease (early onset lymphedema type 1A,) which typically has its onset of swelling and edema at birth or during early infancy, hereditary lymphedema type II, known as Meige disease, has its onset around the time of puberty. Meige disease is also an autosomal dominant disease. It has been linked to a mutations in the ‚Äòforkhead‚Äô family transcription factor (FOXC2) gene located on the long arm of chromosome 16 (16q24.3). About 2000 cases have been identified. A third type of hereditary lymphedema, that has an onset after the age of 35 is known as lymph-edema tarda. Diagnosis Only conservative measures can be taken. Certain treatments for lymphedema disorders may possibly alleviate specific symptoms; no cure and it is usually congenital...genetic counseling can be done. May have similar health conditions, delays, disorders, and physical traits associated with other lymphatic genetic diseases and chromosome #5 abnormalities.  Prognosis  MD does not normally affect life expectancy. Medscape states patients may have recurrent streptococcal cellulitis and lymphangitis, with subsequent hospitalizations for antibiotic therapy. A rare complication is the appearance of lymphangiosarcoma or angiosarcoma in patients with persistent lymphedema. Some patients may develop protein-losing enteropathy and visceral involvement. Chylous ascites and chylothorax rarely occur.

The band released a discography consisting of three demos, one split album, and two albums. History Thronar formed under the name \\"Cerberus\\" in 1998 by guitarists Otto van Beusekom and Reamon Bloem, with drummer Joost Westdijk (of Bolthorn). The band got serious when joined by Nathalia Hoogkamer (keyboards) and Marin (vocals). Under the name Cerberus they released two demos, A Journey Must Begin... and One Man's Faith. In 2002, they changed their name to Thronar because there were many bands called Cerberus, and because they started playing a different style, from black metal to Viking metal. The band have commented on being influenced by the early Norwegian black metal scene; they claim to be atheistic, though they respect certain forms of Satanism. Ideologically, the band hearkens back to old myths and mysticism. In 2003, Thronar recorded a promo consisting of four tracks, which led to the band getting signed to Seven Kingdoms Records. Shortly afterward, the band made a split with three other bands, Arnhem Trolleymetaal. In 2005, Thronar's debut album, For Death and Glory, was released through Seven Kingdoms.Musician: Reamon Bloem, Librariusmetallicus.com. 2006-7-28. Retrieved on 2009-08-05. The album received positive reviews and was reprinted several times. Shortly after in 2006 Reamon decided to fully concentrate on guitar and Koen was brought on for vocal duties. In this lineup the band toured with bands such as Eluveitie, Moonsorrow, Ensiferum, Arch Enemy, Korpiklaani, and In Extremo.

She calls her work \\"problem-oriented rather than discipline- or technique-oriented\\" and has used an interdisciplinary approach to study sustainability. She claims to study physical realities and constraints, not just monetary values, by using process and engineering data to model technology and resource use. Duchin's RPI web page describes her research agenda: :\\"Based on the results of my empirical studies, I became convinced of the need for changes not only in technologies but also in household lifestyles, in particular household decisions regarding diet, housing and transportation. The plausibility and implications of such scenarios need to be explored in a global framework, and I have developed a new model of the world economy for this purpose.\\"Duchin faculty web page at RPI Duchin's recent work focuses on industrial ecology, continuing work she began in the early 1990s. Her 1994 book begins with the question, \\"Can technology ensure environmentally sound economic development?\\" The book uses quantitative analysis of empirical data and discusses alternative scenarios for the future.

Plot summary  The musical follows a young woman, Barbara (played by Guyse), in love with a good and kind bandleader, Bob (portrayed by Daniels), who seems oblivious to her love. Barbara helps Bob write a new song, \\"Cinderella\\", and it becomes an unexpected hit. Success and sudden fame lead Bob to abandon his former performing venue and lose touch with his friends. He becomes caught in the talons of a devious female club-owner who milks his success and tries to also seduce him, even though she is engaged, unbeknownst to Bob. As his career crumbles and the scales fall from his eyes, Bob's press agent finally finds a way for things to end happily: Bob will make a comeback and in doing so will choose a woman's shoe out of dozens entered, and the winner will sing with him and have her prince. Bob rightly picks Barbara's shoe, and the show goes out on yet another great musical number.

It has an apparent magnitude of about 4.25, meaning that it is visible to the naked eye. Based upon parallax measurements made by the Hipparcos spacecraft, the star system is some from the Sun. 88 Tauri is a sextuple star system, meaning that it contains six stars in a hierarchical orbit. The brighter component, 88 Tauri A, is a quadruple system consisting of two spectroscopic binaries orbiting each other with an orbital period of 18 years. The fainter component, 88 Tauri B, is also a spectroscopic binary, and is about 69 arcseconds away, bringing up the total to six stars. Orbit Hierarchy of orbits in the 88 Tauri system 88 Tauri A is a fourth-magnitude star with two components, 88 Tauri Aa and 88 Tauri Ab. 88 Tauri Aa and Ab orbit each other once every 18 years and are separated by about 0.28 arcseconds. Those two components themselves are spectroscopic binaries: binary stars that are too close to be resolved but can be detected by periodic Doppler shifts in their spectrum. In this case, variability in the radial velocity has been recognized as early as 1907. The Aa pair has an orbital period of 3.57 days, the Ab pair has an orbital period of 7.89 days, and both have circular orbits with low orbital eccentricities. 88 Tauri B, 69.56 arcseconds away, is a seventh-magnitude star that is also a binary star system. It is another spectroscopic binary whose components (88 Tauri Ba and Bb) orbit each other every 3.69 years. The orbit of 88 Tauri B around 88 Tauri A likely takes about 70,000 years. Properties 88 Tauri Aa has a spectral type of A6m, indicating that it is an A-type star. The \\"m\\" in its spectral type means that it is an Am star, also known as a metallic-line star. These types of stars have spectra indicating varying amounts of metals, like iron.Am star, The Internet Encyclopedia of Science, David Darling. Accessed on line August 14, 2008. The rest of the stars in 88 Tauri A have spectral types ranging from F5 to G2-3, meaning that they are regular F-type or G-type main-sequence stars. The spectral types for 88 Tauri Ab1 and Ab2 are less certain, because their spectral lines are weaker, hence the colon after G2. Aa1 does not appears to be rotating synchronously with its companion (nor does it have a convective atmosphere), unlike Aa2. (It is not known if the two stars of 88 Tauri Ab are in synchronous rotation with each other, because of the relatively high errors in their measurements.) 88 Tauri B consists of a F-type main sequence star, with another low-mass star. The mass of the smaller component is at least 0.15 solar masses, so it is most likely a red dwarf.

Synopsis Frank (Joe Cheng) is a young man who wears designer labels and thinks he's rather suave when he is actually poor. He had a tragic past and (both his parents died), he doesn't know how to handle money. He borrowed money from the loan sharks but ended up with a gang coming after him. He considers pawning his mother's wedding ring, the only thing he had left of hers, but he couldn't do it. Zeng Shanmei (Ariel Lin) is a poor but very loving, caring, and hard working girl. She has a boyfriend, but he moves to mainland China for university and promises that they will get married after he graduates. Shanmei goes after him to China in the hope that they will finally get married. Shanmei's family is against her decision because they need her to support them, but her father literally holds off the rest of the family while yelling to Shanmei that she should go and be happy. She meets Frank while he's running from the gangsters who loaned him the money‚Äîin the ladies bathroom. Thinking that he's a pervert, she reports him to the police and he gets arrested. The ring fell out of Frank's pocket in the girls' bathroom and the policeman stuck it into Shanmei's bag. He meets Shanmei once more, this time on the road. He tries to get his ring back from her but she has no idea what he's talking about and she still thinks that he's a pervert. He doesn't get his ring, but he does get to drive her to the airport. When she reaches her destination, she meets her boyfriend and casually mentions \\"Xiao Bo\\", his best guy friend. Eventually, her boyfriend cannot take the guilt and admits to Shanmei that he betrayed her and fell for Xiao Bo, who is actually a girl. Shanmei returns to Taiwan with no place to go. She cannot go home because her mother said when she was leaving to China that if she went then she wouldn't be considered a member of the family anymore. Her best friend, Wang Linglong (Zhang Yuchen) was constantly nagging at her not to go and even said \\"don't come crying to me.\\" Shanmei decides to rent a place by using Frank's ring that the policeman had found. Her neighbouring tenant just happens to be no-one other than Frank. When they both want money and they are complete opposites.

He has produced award- winning research in creative industries, media and communications, and online journalism. He is primarily known for his publication, New Media: An Introduction, which is currently in its fourth edition (2002, 2005, 2008, 2014). His research interests includes digital media, global media, media policy, creative industries, media economics, and the future of journalism. Biography Flew graduated from the University of Sydney with a Bachelor of Economics (Honours) in 1986 and a Master of Economics in 1991. Flew received his PhD in Media and Cultural Studies from Griffith University for his thesis titled \\"Culture, Citizenship and Content: Australian Broadcast Media Policy and the Regulation of Commercial Television, 1972-2000\\". In 1990, Flew started his teaching career as a lecturer in the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Technology, Sydney. In 1994, he moved to Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, and worked as a lecturer in Media Studies. During his role as a lecturer in the School of Media and Journalism, Flew also served as the Director of the Centre for Media Policy and Practice. Flew was appointed Senior Lecturer in 2001, and later promoted as Associate Professor and Head of Postgraduate Study in 2006. Since 2009, Flew is the Professor of Media and Communications in the Creative Industries Faculty at Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane. Professional and research experience Flew is the founding editor of Communication Research and Practice, a journal sponsored by the Australian and New Zealand Communication Association, published by Taylor & Francis. In 2009, Flew commenced his role as the President of the Australian and New Zealand Communications Association (ANZCA), while partnering with Sensis in developing Digital Media Foresight analysis to study online user behavior in consuming news. Beginning 2011, Flew also served as the Advisor to Council for the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (CHASS) on communication science in several Australian universities. In the same year, he was appointed as the Commissioner of the Australian Law Reform Commission, responsible of the National Classification Scheme Review, which focuses on technological and media policy in Australia. In 2012, Australian Research Council appointed Flew to be a member of Research Evaluation Committee. Flew is currently serving as the Chair of Global Communication and Social Change Division, in ICA Board. Awards and grants Flew has received numerous awards and grants for his research in media studies, and involved in various projects with an accumulative grant of $4.2 million. One of his notable project, titled Social Media in Times of Crisis: Learning from Recent Natural Disasters to Improve Future Strategies is made possible by the grants from Australian Research Council. The project is evaluating the usage of social media in crisis situations such as natural disaster, and exploring how such usage is utilized by government officials and citizen during emergencies. His latest grant, also from Australian Research Council, is titled Politics, Media and Democracy in Australia: Public and Producer Perceptions of the Political Public Sphere. The project focuses on political media and audience perception in Australia. In 2019 Flew was elected fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities. Works Flew has authored eight books, including Media Economics (Palgrave, 2015), Global Creative Industries (Polity, 2013), Key Concepts in Creative Industries (Sage, 2013), Creative Industries, Culture and Policy (Sage, 2012), Understanding Global Media (Palgrave, 2007), and New Media: An Introduction (Oxford University Press, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2014). He also edited two books, titled Global Media and National Policies: The Return of the State (Palgrave, 2016, with Petros Iosifidis and Jeanette Steemers) and Creative Industries and Urban Development: Creative Cities in the 21st Century (Routledge, 2012), as well as authoring 50 book chapters. Flew has also written 81 academic journal articles and 14 research reports. He also has been the editor for 13 special issues academic journals. = New Media: An Introduction = In New Media: An Introduction, Flew explored the theories of new media, its development and the role of new media in networked society. The book examines how new media is socially, economically and politically impacting creative industries. In the first chapter, Flew tries to define ‚Äúnew media‚Äù as a media that combines three Cs: computing information technology, communication network, and content. One of Flew's biggest contribution in this book is in the second chapter, in which Flew explains 20 key concepts of new media, which includes collective intelligence, convergence, creative industries, cyberspace, digital capitalism, digital copyrights/creative commons, digital divide, globalization, hype, information overload, interactivity, knowledge economy, networks, participation, remediation, security and surveillance, speed, ubiquity, user-generated content/user-led innovation, and virtuality. Flew argues that new media is unable to be categorized as dualistic, as it is an inherent part of constructing the good and the bad for the society. Flew also argues that the significance and usage of new media has not only influenced what people think but also influenced the process of such thinking. In this book, Flew also explores some of the key elements of new media and its usages in globalization, such as the culture of participatory media, the technology of games, online news and the future of digital journalism. Furthermore, Flew also explored how new media is impacting creative industries and internet governance. First published in 2002, the book is currently in its fourth edition, last published in 2014. The latest edition includes additional chapters on Transforming Higher Education, and Online Activism and Networked Politics. It also includes a substantial revision on the chapter of Online News and the Future of Journalism. The Canadian Edition of the book is published in 2011, co-written by Flew and Richard Smith, and now is in its second edition, last published in 2014. = Games: Technology, Industry, Culture = In his book, Flew proposes that the new digital gaming trend works against the mainstream media's portrayal of players as isolated, socially- awkward adolescent boys, hidden away in darkened bedrooms. He draws on recent statistics showing that between 40-50% of those gamers are women, and that the average age of players is mid- to late-20s, rather than young teens.Flew, Terry and Humphreys, Sal (2005) \\"Games: Technology, Industry, Culture\\" Oxford University Press, South Melbourne Flew also credits the advent of video games with popularizing innovative media technologies, allowing consumers to archive, annotate, appropriate and recirculate media content. Consumers can use this media source as an alternative tool to gain access to information within their areas of interest, and to generate their own content and ideas. Flew says that people are drifting away from the traditional mode of consumerism. He uses the term \\"pro-sumer\\" to describe the group of users who both consume and produce new media. These \\"pro-sumers\\" involve themselves in gaming communities in which online and offline spaces become merged and indistinguishable. Flew suggests that part of the appeal of MMORPGs lies in the idea of escapism, and the ability to assume the role of someone or something that is not possible in that individual's real life. To the player, his or her online identity may be more acceptable and desirable than their real-world identity. Flew refers to this form of hopping from one persona to another as \\"identity tourism\\". Players see their in-game personae as \\"theirs\\", whereas game publishers claim ownership of all in-game characters and property, leading to tensions between the two groups. In response to the perennial question of whether violent themes and action in video games correlate with real-life acts of violence, Flew argues that the research in this area is based mostly on a flawed cause-effect model of behaviour, and is often initiated in response to a moral panic.

By the end of the 1950s, radios were common household items, though only state stations were legal. Slovak popular music began as a mix of bossa nova, cool jazz, and rock, with propagandistic lyrics. Dissenters listened to ORF (Austrian Radio), Radio Luxembourg, or Radio Free Europe, which played more rock. Czechoslovakia was more passive in the face of Soviet domination, and thus radio and the whole music industry toed the line more closely than other satellite states. After the Velvet Revolution and the declaration of the Slovak state, domestic music greatly diversified as free enterprise allowed a great expansion in the number of bands and genres represented in the Slovak market. Soon, however, major label brought pop music to Slovakia and drove many of the small companies out of business. The 1990s, American grunge and alternative rock, and Britpop gain a wide following, as well as a newfound popularity in musicals.

The plant is nearly stemless and measures two to four centimeters in diameter.  History  A photo of Potentilla robbinsiana (Robbins' cinquefoil) taken by the U.S.D.A. Forest Service. The Crawford Path of Mount Washington, the oldest mountain hiking trail in America, was laid out in 1819 as a bridle path from Crawford Notch to the summit.Condensed Facts About Mount Washington, Atkinson News Co., 1912. There is some discrepancy as to who discovered Potentilla robbinsiana, which some sources giving credit to its discovery in 1824 by English botanist and zoologist Thomas Nuttall, five years after completion of the Crawford Path. The more likely case is its discovery in 1829 by James Robbins. After its discovery it was described by the botanist and explorer William Oakes. It was soon recognized as a rare plant and over 850 specimens were collected and occasionally sold commercially to collectors and herbariums. In the 1970s a \\"backpacker boom\\" led to significantly increased use of the Crawford Path, making the plant's limited habitat vulnerable to hikers picking the flowers and trampling the plant. The decline of specimens of the plant was mitigated when it received protection under the Endangered Species Act in 1980, at which time the known population was a mere 3,700 plants. However, due to a very successful awareness program and an effort to reroute trails away from the plant's habitat along with enclosures for the main population, the plant has since then recovered to well over 14,000 plants and was delisted in August 2002. USFWS Delisting Report dated 8/2009 Additional efforts included public education, biological research, seed collection and transplant efforts. The awareness program and repopulation efforts were successful in a large part due to a unique partnership between the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, the Appalachian Mountain Club, the U.S. Forest Service, and the New England Wild Flower Society.  Distribution  The White Mountain National Forest contains 100% of this species' global population. The plant has four extant occurrences, with two being natural and two others from transplant efforts.  Habitat  Potentilla robbinsiana is generally placed in the dry/mesic heath meadow system of alpine communities, though it is also found on subalpine bare rock summits. The primary habitat is an exposed and barren fellfield habitat with high winds and low temperatures. While frost heaving is considered a requirement, too much causes mortality.

He became national 400 m champion and also represented Australia internationally. Biography Born in Sydney, Offereins' family moved to Perth in 1987. He has been running from a young age, starting out in little athletics and has progressed through to the senior ranks. His first National title came in winning the 200m at the 2003 Under 18 Australian Championships where he also won the silver medal in the 100m. He had his first major 400m win the next year at the Under 20 Australian Championships, which earned him a position on the Australian team for the IAAF World Junior Championships, in Grosseto, Italy in July 2004. He participated in the individual 400m as well as the 4 √ó 400 m relay. In 2005 still as a junior he entered the open Australian National Championships for the 400m where he won the gold medal defeating 3 members of the Australian 4 √ó 400 m relay team which won the silver medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics. The next few seasons saw Offereins plagued by injuries until June 2009 when he set a new personal best for the 400m of 45.69s, a World Championships B qualifier, which earned him the final position on the Australian 4 √ó 400 m relay team for Berlin 2009. Running a sensational third leg during the heat (44.78s) Offereins forced his way into the team for the final where the Australian team of John Steffensen, Ben Offereins, Tristan Thomas, and Sean Wroe, won the bronze medal for Australia. In 2010 Offereins started his season by winning the Australia Cup held in Canberra in a new PB of 45.32 sec, he then broke his PB again at the Sydney Track Classic running 44.86sec and becoming only the eighth Australian to break the 45.00 sec barrier and the seventh fastest Australian of all time. He continued his form, winning the IAAF Melbourne Track Classic in 45.73sec, and then the Australian National Championships in 45.17 sec. This gained him automatic selection for the individual 400m and the 4x400 relay at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India. At the Athletics Australia annual end of season awards night he was named the Male athlete of the year for the 2010 Australian Domestic season. He represented Australia at the 2012 Summer Olympics, as part of the men's 4 x 400 metre relay team.

The club was considered by some as the liveliest and most creative outside London. The club hosted some of the premier folk artists of the day including Al Jones, Fred Wedlock, Pigsty Hill Light Orchestra, Ian Anderson, Mike Cooper, John Renbourn, Bert Jansch, The Incredible String Band and Roy Harper. Al Stewart had a residency there, and mentions the club in his song \\"Clifton in the Rain\\". History The Troubadour was opened in Waterloo Street, Clifton, by a returning Australian emigree, Ray Willmott, on Friday 7 October 1966. The first act to play there was Anderson Jones Jackson (Ian Anderson, Al Jones and Elliott Jackson).Jones, p.5 Other regular performers included the Guyanese calypso singer Norman Beaton and the actor Chris Langham who performed as \\"Wizz\\" Langham (inspired, no doubt, by Wizz Jones). From 1967, the \\"Folk Blues Bristol and West\\" club, founded by Ian Anderson, met on the first Sunday of each month at the Troubadour but became so popular that it had to move to larger premises, firstly at The Old Duke in King Street and, later, to the Full Moon on Stokes Croft.Jones, p.10 In 1967, Stewart mentioned the club in his track \\"Clifton in the Rain\\" from his first album \\"Bed Sitter Images\\": :And all along the way :Wanderers in overcoats with :Collars on parade :And steaming in the night :The listeners in the Troubadour :Guitar player weaves a willow strain :I took my love to Clifton in the rain In 1971, the venue closed following the purchase of the premises by a Peter Bush, just after it advertised that it had gained a drinks licence (having been alcohol-free from its inception). Dave Berry wrote in Pre-View magazine that \\"the loss of the Troubadour can't just be assessed in terms of the weekly entertainment it provided. Above all, the club was a social centre - and an inspiration and springboard for countless young artists\\". The club is held in such great affection by its former members and musicians that three Troubadour reunions have been held since 2000. The first took place at the QEH Theatre in Clifton on 9 November 2002 and featured many of the original artists. A double CD, Waterloo Street RevisitedWaterloo Street Revisited.

The relations of the Faroe Islands with the EU are governed by a Fisheries Agreement (1977) and a Free Trade Agreement (1991, revised 1998). The main reason for remaining outside the EU is disagreements about the Common Fisheries Policy. EU relations As explicitly asserted by both Rome treaties, the Faroe Islands are not part of the European Union. This means that free movement of goods, people, capital and services within the EU and other directives do not apply for the Faroe Islands. A protocol to the treaty of accession of Denmark to the European Communities stipulates that Danish nationals residing in the Faroe Islands are not to be considered as Danish nationals within the meaning of the treaties. Hence, Danish people living in the Faroes are not citizens of the European Union (other EU nationals living there remain EU citizens), and do not have the right to settle in the EU without special permits. The Faroe Islands are not part of the Schengen Area. However, persons travelling between the Faroe Islands and the Schengen Area are not subject to border controls, although there may be identity checks when checking in for flights. Charges for international services such as phone roaming and bank transfers are much higher than inside the EU.  EU boycott against the Faroe Islands  In July 2013 EU imposed sanctions on the Faroe Islands due to a dispute over the fishing quota of herring and mackerel. The boycott, which started on 28 August 2013, banned Faroese vessels carrying herring or mackerel from all EU ports, including Denmark, Sweden and Finland.noraregiontrends.org, GREENLAND SUPPORTS THE FAROE ISLANDS IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC FISHERIES CONFLICT The Faroe Islands could no longer export herring or mackerel to EU countries. The boycott was lifted on 20 August 2014 after a breakthrough in negotiations which saw the Faroese share of the total mackerel quota jump from 4.62% to 12.6%. Euro adoption The Faroe Islands utilize a special version of the Danish krone notes that have been printed with text in the Faroese language. It is not a separate currency, but can be exchanged 1:1 with the Danish version. Monetary policy is controlled by the Danish Central Bank. If Denmark does adopt the euro, separate referendums would be required in the Faroe Islands and Greenland to decide whether they should follow suit. Both territories have voted not to be a part of the EU in the past, and their populations will not participate in the Danish euro referendum. On 5 November 2009 the Faroese Parliament approved a proposal to investigate the possibility for euro adoption, including an evaluation of the legal and economic impact of adopting the euro ahead of Denmark. EU membership There are politicians, mainly in the right-wing Union Party (Sambandsflokkurin), led by their chairman Kaj Leo Johannesen, who would like to see the Faroes as a member of the EU. However, the chairman of the left- wing Republic (Tj√≥√∞veldi), H√∏gni Hoydal, has expressed concerns that if the Faroes were to join the EU as is, they might vanish inside the EU, sharing this with the situation of the Shetland Islands and √Öland today, and wants the local government to solve the political situation between the Faroes and Denmark first. A major concern is also fishing, which accounts for 90 percent of Faroese exports. As such a large part of their economy, the islands do not want decisions on it being made so far away as they would have so little say in the EU due to their small population. As an EU member, according to the Common Fisheries Policy they would have to give away large fish quotas in their own waters to other EU countries.

Life  Born in Budapest on 15 November 1869 into a prominent Hungarian noble family as the second son of Count L√°szl√≥ Szap√°ry (1831‚Äì1883), an Austro-Hungarian general who had played a leading role in the occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, and his wife Countess Marianne von Gr√ºnne). He was also a cousin of Count Gyula Szap√°ry, Prime Minister of Hungary from 1890 to 1892. Hedwig von Szap√°ry with daughter. St. Peterburg, 1914. On 27 April 1908, he married Princess Hedwig von Windisch-Graetz (1878‚Äì1918), daughter of Alfred F√ºrst zu Windisch-Gr√§tz and Princess Marie Gabrielle Eleonore von Auersperg (1855‚Äì1933). Her father had been Minister President of Austria from 1893 to 1895 and served as President of the Upper Chamber. The couple had four children of which the daughter Marianne (1911‚Äì1988) was the mother of Princess Michael of Kent. Following studies in law, Count Szap√°ry joined the Austro-Hungarian foreign service and began his diplomatic career in 1895 as an attach√© in Rome, followed by postings in Berlin in 1899 and Munich in 1903. In 1907, he returned to Vienna to serve in the Foreign Ministry at the Ballhausplatz and made a rapid career. Considered a rising star he was appointed as chef de cabinet to Foreign Minister Count Lexa von Aehrenthal in December 1909, a post that allowed him to exercise considerable influence over policy-making.William D. Godsey, Aristocratic Redoubt: The Austro-Hungarian Foreign Office on the Eve of the First World War, West Lafayette, Purdue University Press, 1999, p. 12. Considered a prot√©g√© of Aehrenthal, he belonged to a group of younger diplomats (together with Count von Hoyos and Count von Forg√°ch) who believed that the Dual Monarchy could only be saved from disintegration by a more aggressive and dynamic foreign policy. During the Balkan crisis, he had favoured armed intervention against Serbia.Godsey, op. cit., p. 190. In April 1912, he was appointed to Second Section Chief, which was equivalent to head of the Political Section, in a period of international turmoil. Described as \\"gifted, quick, hard-working, and a bit mysterious\\",Godsey, op. cit., p. 12 Aehrenthal's successor Count Berchtold lauded him as for \\"his outstanding skill in handling political issues and his judgment which far exceeded the norm\\".'Friedrich Graf Sz√°p√°ry von Muraszombat, Szechysziget, und Sz√°p√°r', Solving Problems Through Force Austrian Embassy building in St Petersburg. 1914. On 1 October 1913, Count Szap√°ry was appointed as ambassador at St. Petersburg which was significant in the sense that he was considered a Russophobe and was far less willing to accommodate the Russians than his predecessor had been.Graydon A. Tunstall, Jr, 'Austria-Hungary', in Richard F. Hamilton & Holger H. Herwig (eds.), The Origins of World War I, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 119. However, he did not arrive until early the following year and he presented his credentials to the Tsar first on 14 February 1914. Due to pressing family matters, he had to leave within two weeks and returned to St. Petersburg in mid-April, staying until late May. He returned only in mid-July which meant that the Dual Monarchy lacked its chief diplomat in the Russian capital during the Sarajevo crisis, daily business being conducted by Count Czernin as charg√© d'affaires.Godsey, op. cit.. Once back to St. Petersburg on 17 July, Count Szap√°ry came to play a significant role. At a diplomatic reception on 21 July, he had a sharp exchange with the visiting French President Poincar√©For an account of the exchange between Count Szap√°ry and Poincar√©, see Maurice Pal√©ologue, An Ambassador's Memoirs, 3 vols., New York, 1923-1924. and he held several meetings with Russian Foreign Minister Sazonov over the following days.For an account of the meetings, see for example Clive Ponting, Thirteen days: diplomacy and disaster, London, Pimlico, 2002. However, as war proved inevitable it eventually fell upon him to deliver the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war against Russia on 6 August, whereupon he left St. Petersburg. In 1915, he became a member of the Upper House (Herrenhaus), but played no further major role during the war. Count Szap√°ry died in Vienna on 18 March 1935.

The resolution marked the UN's first civilian \\"safe area\\" being declared; it failed to prevent the Srebrenica massacre. Resolution Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council went on to demand that all parties and others concerned treat Srebrenica and its surroundings as a safe area which should be free from any armed attack or any other hostile act, further demanding the cessation of all hostilities and withdrawal by Bosnian Serb paramilitary forces from areas around Srebrenica. This was the first instance of a civilian \\"safe area\\" being declared in the world. It also demanded that Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cease supplying weapons, military equipment and other services to Bosnian Serb paramilitary units in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The resolution then requested the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to increase the presence of the Protection Force in Srebrenica and surrounding areas requesting full co-operation from parties and others concerned and for Boutros-Ghali to report thereon to the Council. 147 peacekeepers were later deployed to reassure Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic that the town would not be used as a base to attack his forces. It also reaffirmed that the acquisition of territory by threat or use of force, particularly through ethnic cleansing, is unlawful and unacceptable in international humanitarian law. The Council condemned the \\"abhorrent campaign of ethnic cleansing\\" by the Bosnian Serb paramilitaries and its actions of forcing the evacuation of the civilian population from Srebrenica. Regarding humanitarian aid, the Council demanded the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance to all areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in particular to the civilian population of Srebrenica and that any disruption to the delivery constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law. It then urged the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to reinforce the existing humanitarian operations in the region. Finally, Resolution 819 demanded that all parties ensure the safety of the Protection Force, United Nations personnel and other international organisations, allowing for the safe transfer of injured civilians from Srebrenica and its surrounding areas, and announced its decision to send a mission of members of the Security Council to assess the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The \\"safe area\\" would later be extended to other towns including Tuzla, ≈Ωepa, Bihaƒá, Gora≈æde and Sarajevo in Resolution 824. Ineffectiveness Despite its preemptive wording, Resolution 819 failed to prevent the Srebrenica massacre in July 1995, when the United Nations Protection Force were taken prisoner and the refugees from the fallen enclave fell into the hands of the forces of Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladiƒá, subsequently indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for war crimes including genocide. In his chronology of events at Srebrenica, Under the UN Flag, the genocide survivor Hasan Nuhanoviƒá criticises members of the international community involved on the ground or indirectly influencing or capable of influencing events for specific failures to fulfil their responsibility to protect the Muslim population of the besieged \\"safe area\\" under Resolution 819.Nuhanoviƒá, Hasan (2007).

J. Sakurai in the 1960s before the introduction of quantum chromodynamics to describe interactions between energetic photons and hadronic matter. In particular, the hadronic components of the physical photon consist of the lightest vector mesons, \\\\rho, \\\\omega and \\\\phi. Therefore, interactions between photons and hadronic matter occur by the exchange of a hadron between the dressed photon and the hadronic target. Background Hadronic contribution to the photon propagator in the VMD model Measurements of the interaction between energetic photons and hadrons show that the interaction is much more intense than expected by the interaction of merely photons with the hadron's electric charge. Furthermore, the interaction of energetic photons with protons is similar to the interaction of photons with neutrons in spite of the fact that the electric charge structures of protons and neutrons are substantially different. According to VMD, the photon is a superposition of the pure electromagnetic photon (which interacts only with electric charges) and vector meson. Just after 1970, when more accurate data on the above processes became available, some discrepancies with the VMD predictions appeared and new extensions of the model were published. These theories are known as Generalized Vector Meson Dominance theories (GVMD). VMD and Hidden Local Symmetry Whilst the ultraviolet description of the standard model is based on QCD, work over many decades has involved writing a low energy effective description of QCD, and further, positing a possible \\"dual\\" description. One such popular description is that of the hidden local symmetry. The dual description is based on the idea of emergence of gauge symmetries in the infrared of strongly coupled theories. Gauge symmetries are not really physical symmetries (only the global elements of the local gauge group are physical). This emergent property of gauge symmetries was demonstrated in Seiberg duality and later in the development of the AdS/CFT correspondence. In its generalised form, Vector Meson Dominance appears in AdS/CFT, AdS/QCD, AdS/condensed matter and some Seiberg dual constructions. It is therefore a common place idea within the theoretical physics community. Criticism Measurements of the photon-hadron interactions in higher energy levels show that VMD cannot predict the interaction in such levels. In his Nobel lecture J.I. Friedman summarizes the situation of VMD as follows: \\"...this eliminated the model [VMD] as a possible description of deep inelastic scattering... calculations of the generalized vector-dominance failed in general to describe the data over the full kinematic range...\\" The Vector Meson Dominance model still sometimes makes significantly more accurate predictions of hadronic decays of excited light mesons involving photons than subsequent models such as the relativistic quark model for the meson wave function and the covariant oscillator quark model.See, e.g., The COMPASS Collaboration, \\"Measurement of radiative widths of a2(1320) and œÄ2(1670)\\" (March 11, 2014) Similarly, the Vector Meson Dominance model has outperformed perturbative QCD in making predictions of transitional form factors of the neutral pion meson, the eta meson, and the eta prime meson, that are \\"hard to explain within QCD.\\"Yaroslav Klopot, Armen Oganesian and Oleg Teryaev, \\"Axial anomaly and vector meson dominance model\\" (4 December 2013) And, the model accurately reproduces recent experimental data for rho meson decays.D.

Toledo S√°nchez, \\"Determination of the magnetic dipole moment of the rho meson\\" (27 May 2013) Generalizations of the Vector Meson Dominance model to higher energies, or to consider additional factors present in cases where VMD fails, have been proposed to address the shortcomings identified by Friedman and others.V.

Improper procedures (or improperly-documented procedures) to subtract out the noise in data can lead to a false sense of accuracy or false conclusions. Data = true signal + noise Noisy data are data with a large amount of additional meaningless information in it called noise. This includes data corruption and the term is often used as a synonym for corrupt data. It also includes any data that a user system cannot understand and interpret correctly. Many systems, for example, cannot use unstructured text. Noisy data can adversely affect the results of any data analysis and skew conclusions if not handled properly. Statistical analysis is sometimes used to weed the noise out of noisy data.  Sources of noise  In this example of an outlier and filtering, point t2 is an outlier. The smooth transition to and from the outlier is from filtering, and is also not valid data, but more noise. Presenting filtered results (the smoothed transitions) as actual measurements can lead to false conclusions. This type of filter (a moving average) shifts the data to the right. The moving average price at a given time is usually much different than the actual price at that time. Differences in real-world measured data from the true values come about from by multiple factors affecting the measurement. Random noise is often a large component of the noise in data.R.Y. Wang, V.C. Storey, C.P. Firth, A Framework for Analysis of Data Quality Research, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 7 (1995) 623-640 doi: 10.1109/69.404034) Random noise in a signal is measured as the Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Random noise contains almost equal amounts of a wide range of frequencies, and is also called white noise (as colors of light combine to make white). Random noise is an unavoidable problem. It affects the data collection and data preparation processes, where errors commonly occur. Noise has two main sources: errors introduced by measurement tools and random errors introduced by processing or by experts when the data is gathered.X. Zhu, X. Wu, Class Noise vs. Attribute Noise: A Quantitative Study, Artificial Intelligence Review 22 (2004) 177-210 doi: 10.1007/s10462-004-0751-8 Improper Filtering can add noise, if the filtered signal is treated as if it were a directly measured signal. As an example, Convolution-type digital filters such a moving average can have side effects such as lags or truncation of peaks. Differentiating digital filters amplify random noise in the original data. Outlier data are data that appears to not belong in the data set. It can be caused by human error such as transposing numerals, mislabeling, programming bugs, etc. If actual outliers are not removed from the data set, they corrupt the results to a small or large degree depending on circumstances. If valid data is identified as an outlier and is mistakenly removed, that also corrupts results. Fraud: Individuals may deliberately skew data to influence the results toward a desired conclusion. Data that looks good with few outliers reflects well on the individual collecting it, and so there may be incentive to remove more data as outliers, or make the data look smoother than it is.

This international bridge crossed the St. Croix River between the border hamlets of St. Croix in the Canadian province of New Brunswick and Vanceboro in the U.S. state of Maine. At the time of the sabotage attempt in 1915, the bridge was jointly owned and operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway on the Canadian side and the Maine Central Railroad on the American side. The bombing was masterminded by then spymaster Franz von Papen and executed by Werner Horn. The bomb failed to destroy the bridge but made it unsafe to use until minor repairs were done. The explosion did however blow out windows in nearby buildings in St. Croix and Vanceboro.  Background  Franz von Papen at the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials in 1946 In 1915 the United States was still a neutral country in World War I. The Canadian Pacific Railway was prohibited to carry any war goods or troops onto or through United States territory. After Japan entered the war in 1914 on behalf of its British ally, Germany feared that Japan might send troops to the Western Front, across the Pacific Ocean and through Canada, en route. The German government was convinced that would occur and ordered that the Canadian railway system be interrupted. At the outbreak of World War I, Werner Horn was a German reserve army lieutenant who had been in Moka, Guatemala, as the manager of a coffee plantation. After hearing about the outbreak of war, he departed the plantation looking to return to Germany. From Moka, he proceeded to British Honduras, and from there sailed to Galveston, Texas, and onwards to New York City. He was unable to depart for Germany due to the British blockade in the North Sea. After attempting to set sail for over a month he travelled to Mexico City to return to the plantation. While there, he learned that someone else had taken his job. He found work at another plantation in Salto de Agua, Chiapas, but before he could leave, he received a card telling him to return to Germany. On December 26, 1914, Horn travelled to New Orleans and then returned to New York, where he stayed in the Arietta Hotel. While there he met Von Papen, the military attach√© of the German Embassy in Washington, DC. Von Papen was seeking saboteurs to disrupt Canadian railways and thought that Horn, who was eager to serve the fatherland, was an ideal candidate. Von Papen went on to explain to the zealous Horn that the bombing would be seen as an act of courage and valour in Germany and that no one would be killed in the process. The bridge was heavily used at the time, and there was a good chance that a train would be caught up in any explosion. Horn was paid $700 to destroy the St. Croix-Vanceboro railway bridge. (Such a sum is equivalent to about $16,400 in buying power in 2016.)  Bombing  Horn left New York from Grand Central Terminal on a New Haven Railroad passenger train to Boston on January 29, 1915, carrying a suitcase of dynamite. He took the overnight train out of Boston (operated by the Boston and Maine Railroad), placing the suitcase of explosives in a lower berth. Horn's sleeping car was transferred to the Maine Central Railroad in Portland and proceeded east across Maine to the Maine Central's eastern terminus at the border hamlet of Vanceboro the following day. Upon arrival in Vanceboro, Horn checked into the Exchange Hotel and was observed hiding the suitcase in a wood pile outdoors while scouting the railway bridge on the border over the St. Croix River several hundred feet to the east; this bridge was jointly owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Maine Central Railroad. At least three Vanceboro residents reported his suspicious behaviour to the US immigration inspector. The inspector interviewed Horn at the hotel, and Horn assured him that he was merely a Danish farmer looking to purchase land in the area. Horn spent the next two days maintaining a low profile and watching the extremely-busy Canadian Pacific Railway main line to determine the schedule of trains. On the night of Monday, February 1, 1915, Horn checked out of the hotel claiming to be catching a train that evening. He apparently changed into a German army uniform to avoid being convicted of being a spy (and potentially executed) before proceeding to the railway bridge over the St. Croix River sometime after midnight. Horn proceeded to position a suitcase filled with explosives on the Canadian side of the bridge but was interrupted by an oncoming train and was forced to move out of its path. After he was sure that it had passed, he proceeded to reposition the explosives. He was interrupted a second time by another train. Puzzled and not wanting to kill anyone, he waited until 1:07 a.m. on February 2 before again repositioning the bomb on a girder. Horn cut the fuse, which changed the time before the explosion from fifty minutes to only three. Horn lit the fuse with a cigar and somehow made it back to the Exchange Hotel through a gale in temperature before the dynamite exploded. At 1:10 a.m. on Tuesday, February 2, 1915, the bomb exploded, blowing out windows across Vanceboro and St. Croix and exposing residents to the freezing air outside. Some iron beams on the bridge were twisted or bent, but the damage was relatively minor. Werner Horn (left) with Deputy Sheriff Geo. W. Ross (right) Horn had frostbite on his hands and was assisted by the hotel's proprietor, who allowed him to check back in for the night. The proprietor connected the explosion with Horn's suspicious presence and, upon being informed by residents of the community who had discovered the source and target of the explosion, informed the CPR, which closed the bridge and rerouted trains pending a safety inspection. Railway officials inspected the bridge the following morning and discovered the damage was relatively minor, resulting in the bridge being out of service for only several days. Arrest and imprisonment The sheriff for Vanceboro, along with two Canadian police officers from McAdam, New Brunswick, who crossed the border to provide assistance, detained Horn at the hotel. Horn reportedly changed into his German army uniform (to avoid being arrested as a spy, which was an executable offence) and surrendered to American authorities. Since the bomb exploded on the Canadian (St. Croix, New Brunswick) side of the bridge, the only charge that the United States could initially lay against Horn to detain him was a mischief charge for breaking windows in Vanceboro. Horn was moved soon thereafter to a jail in Machias, Maine for his safety (Vanceboro residents were upset with him over the damage that he had caused them) while Canadian authorities began the process of seeking his extradition. Horn was interrogated by the Bureau of Investigation for several days and signed a confession with an agreed-upon statement of facts in which he revealed the details of his crime. Horn faced a federal grand jury in Boston at the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and was indicted on March 2, 1915, for his most serious crime while in the United States, a charge of transporting explosives on a common carrier that also transported passengers for hire. He was sentenced to serve 18 months at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary in Georgia. After serving his sentence, Horn was extradited to Canada in October 1919 and was tried in the Court of Queen's Bench of New Brunswick in Fredericton. He was found guilty and sentenced to serve 10 years at Dorchester Penitentiary in New Brunswick. Horn was assessed by Canadian prison authorities to be insane in July 1921, when he was released and deported to Germany. He was in fact suffering from the advanced stages of syphilisCA News Bombing happened 100 years ago accessed November 7.2018  Notes  References   External links *\\"Seek to Extradite Bridge Dynamiter\\", Evening Star.

In 784, when fellow chancellor Xiao Fu suggested that Chen Shaoyou (Èô≥Â∞ëÈÅä) the military governor (Jiedushi) of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) be replaced with Wei Gao, Emperor Dezong ordered Xiao to only discuss the matter with another chancellor, Liu Congyi, excluding Lu and Li Mian from the discussion, and Xiao's refusal to do so eventually led to Xiao's resignation.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 231. Around the new year 785, Lu was given the additional title as overseer of Taiwei Palace (Â§™ÂæÆÂÆÆ).New Book of Tang, vol. 62 . In spring 785, Lu and Liu were recorded as not having dared to oppose the promotion of former chancellor Lu Qi, whom the popular sentiment had blamed for the rebellions of Zhu and Li Huaiguang. In 786, Lu Han was removed from his chancellor post and made an advisor to Emperor Dezong's crown prince Li Song.

Records show that 1878 featured a relatively active hurricane season. A total of twelve storms were observed during the year. There were two tropical storms, eight hurricanes and two major hurricanes (Category 3+). However, in the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded, so the actual total could be higher.

This hurricane caused at least 72 fatalities in Cuba and the United States. Estimated damage from this storm amounted to $2 million. Systems =Tropical Storm One= On July 1 a tropical storm developed in the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast. It produced frequent rain, easterly wind, and diminishing pressure in Florida. The storm made landfall in Florida on July 2 with maximum sustained winds of ; Punta Rassa, Florida, recorded a minimum pressure of that afternoon. Key West, Florida, registered a wind of . The storm likely briefly weakened to a tropical depression over Florida but emerged into the Atlantic Ocean that afternoon and quickly regained tropical storm status. Rainy weather with frequent easterly gales extended northward through South Carolina. On July 3, easterly gales and rainy weather prevailed along the Atlantic coast as far north as Cape Hatteras. Smithville, North Carolina, registered a maximum wind of from the east. The tropical storm exited the coastal region on the afternoon of July 3, and no further records are, currently, known. =Hurricane Two= A tropical storm was discovered in the vicinity of the Leeward Islands on August 8\\\\. It moved to the west across the Caribbean Sea and then to the northwest. By the time that it entered the Gulf of Mexico, the system had intensified into a hurricane. The storm moved west across the Gulf of Mexico, and maintained hurricane status until making landfall in Mexico on August 18\\\\. The hurricane had dissipated over Mexico by the next day. =Hurricane Three= A Category One hurricane was first observed in the mid-Atlantic, north-east of Bermuda, on August 19\\\\. It moved to the north, toward Atlantic Canada. The hurricane grazed Nova Scotia shortly before it reached peak intensity. Sustained winds at peak intensity were while the minimum central pressure was at 963 mbar, the most intense on record for a category 1 hurricane. It then grazed Newfoundland before it became extratropical in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence on August 21. =Hurricane Four= A tropical storm was discovered in the vicinity of the Bahamas on August 25\\\\. It moved to the northeast early in its duration. By August 27 it strengthened into a hurricane. After this it steadily got stronger as it moved toward Bermuda. On August 28 it had been upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane. Near peak intensity it passed within of Bermuda. At peak intensity, the maximum sustained wind was and the pressure was 972 mbar. The intensity of the storm barely leveled off over the next two days. The cyclone was last seen on August 30. =Hurricane Five= A tropical storm was first observed on September 1 just north of South America. It moved to the west-northwest, becoming a hurricane before hitting the Leeward Islands on September 2\\\\. It continued across the Caribbean, hitting Haiti and paralleling the north coast of Cuba. By September 7 it had weakened to a tropical storm and was east of Key West, Florida. It made landfall, on the Florida peninsula, soon afterwards and began moving slowly north before drifting back offshore where it strengthened. It remained over Florida for three days due to slow movement. On the morning of September 10 it began moving east and made landfall north of Tampa with maximum sustained winds of . The center passed over St. Augustine on September 11. When it reached the western Atlantic it became a hurricane again and caused several ships to be wrecked along the north-east coast of Florida, between Cape Canaveral and Amelia Island. It hit South Carolina by the morning of September 12, and, becoming extratropical, reached Ontario (where, claiming at least 4 lives, it had been raining since September 10)The Great Rainstorm, The (Toronto) Globe, September 14, 1878, page 8. by the morning of September 13\\\\. In Central Florida, the cyclone flooded the area near Fort Basinger, including the Kissimmee River valley, in present-day Okeechobee County. Very heavy rainfall along its path affected the Florida peninsula.Barnes. p. 70. The hurricane caused at least nine deaths, though some reports suggest more were likely. =Hurricane Six= =Hurricane Seven= A tropical storm was first observed in the central Caribbean on September 24\\\\. It moved to the north, strengthening into a Category 1 hurricane before making landfall in Haiti. It quickly weakened to a tropical storm while passing roughly to the west of Port-au-Prince. An American brigatine was wrecked at Tiburon with all hands lost. The storm rapidly regained hurricane status after emerging into the Atlantic. It passed through the eastern Bahamas shortly before it was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane. Again it gradually strengthened, becoming a Category 3 hurricane by September 30 and a Category 4 hurricane by October 2\\\\. It continued to the northeast and moved away from land. The cyclone also maintained major hurricane status at a high latitude, roughly at 47.5N, but weakened somewhat before it was last seen on October 8\\\\. =Hurricane Eight= A tropical storm formed in the Gulf of Mexico on October 9\\\\. It moved across Florida, and after tracking near the coasts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, it strengthened to a hurricane. The storm brought heavy wind and rain to New England, causing 27 deaths. =Hurricane Nine= A tropical storm was first discovered on October 9 in the mid-Atlantic. It strengthened into a minimal hurricane before it dissipated at sea on October 16. It is likely that Hurricane Eight and Hurricane Nine merged into a single, large extratropical storm on October 16. =Hurricane Ten= Hurricane Ten was a major hurricane that remained at sea during its entire duration. It was first discovered while a tropical storm of October 13\\\\. Over the next two days it strengthened slightly. By October 15 it became a hurricane and a Category 2 hurricane by the next day. It had also become a Category 3 hurricane on October 17\\\\. It attained peak intensity on October 18, sustained winds reached . The hurricane weakened slightly before it was last seen on October 19\\\\. =Hurricane Eleven= The Gale of 1878 On October 18 a tropical storm formed west of Jamaica. As it neared landfall in Cuba, it strengthened to a 100 mph (160 km/h) hurricane, but weakened while crossing the island. It passed over southeast Florida and the Bahamas, strengthening to a 100 mph (160 km/h) hurricane again before hitting North Carolina between Wilmington and Morehead City. The hurricane raced across the interior of the United States, becoming extratropical on the 24th over New York. The hurricane caused over $2 million in damage, and at least 72 casualties. These included 19 people killed when a ship, the A.S.Davis, was driven ashore at Virginia Beach. In total, the hurricane was responsible for 22 shipwrecks. Among these was the steamer City of Houston which was lost on Frying Pan Shoals. =Tropical Storm Twelve= Tropical Storm San Rufo of 1878 A tropical storm was first discovered on November 25 some 700 miles east of the Lesser Antilles. On November 28 and 29 it passed over much of the northern Lesser Antilles. The storm then passed near the southern coast of Puerto Rico and its effects were felt in southeastern and southern Puerto Rico. It was first known tropical storm to impact Puerto Rico in November. Sustained winds of 70+mph. Later on it continued into the Caribbean and dissipated on December 2 while a few hundred miles south of Jamaica.

History The name Eridge derives from 'Eagle ridge', or 'ridge frequented by eagles'. Eridge was the seat (main home) of the Earls and Marquesses of Abergavenny. In 1792 Henry Nevill, 2nd Earl of Abergavenny converted the old Eridge House into a Gothic castle, which he named Eridge Castle. The castle was replaced by a neo-Georgian mansion in the 1930s. As a 20th-century structure on an ancient site, the house is not a listed building. Parkland and woodland The area is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, as well as a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I and Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England. Eridge Park's undulating parkland is densely wooded to its north (Whitehill Wood) and south (Saxonbury Hill). The site includes gardens, parkland, and ancient woodland, and is highly rated (Grade II* listed) for its landscape by English Heritage.Eridge Park (Park and Garden), It is of national importance for its lichens, with 167 recorded species in one of the richest epiphytic lichen floras of any park in Britain. It is also of interest for its 22 species of dragonflies and 60 species of breeding birds. Village and surroundings Eridge Park is directly north of Rotherfield, and largely overlaps the ecclesiastical parish of Eridge Green. Eridge Castle, the predecessor property, had its own ecclesiastical parish until 1856. On the village street of Eridge Park is the church, which is Grade II listed,Holy Trinity Church, Eridge, Grade II, and six other listed buildings including the public house, the Nevill Crest and Gun. The area also contains several follies, including the Saxonbury Tower and several ornamental buildings near the Sham Farm industrial estate. Sham Farm, an arable farm, gets its name from a wall built there to hide imposing farm buildings, which was intended to make the farm look like a very large house when viewed from Eridge Castle. The industrial estate at Sham Farm includes businesses such as Chalybeate Springs Trout Fishery and the Speldhurst Quality Foods sausage factory.

Background  Li Mian was born in 717, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. He was a member of Tang Dynasty's imperial Li clan, being a great-grandson of Li Yuanyi (ÊùéÂÖÉÊáø) the Prince of Zheng, a son of Tang's founding emperor Emperor Gaozu.Old Book of Tang, vol. 131. His father Li Zeyan (ÊùéÊìáË®Ä) was a son of Li Yuanyi's son Li Xuan (ÊùéÁíø) the Duke of Nanhai, but as Li Xuan's brother Li Lin (ÊùéÁê≥) the Duke of Ande was sonless, Li Lin adopted Li Zeyan, who thus inherited the title of Duke of Ande.New Book of Tang, vol. 70. Li Zeyan successively served as a prefect of four prefectures, and while serving under the important official Zhang Jiazhen, who was otherwise arrogant and condescending toward his subordinates, was particularly respected by Zhang. Li Mian himself was said to be studious in the Confucian classics and histories in his youth, and after he grew, was said to be quiet, elegant, honest, and strict. He also was well-learned in mysticism. As he was a close relative to the imperial line, he was eventually made the magistrate of Kaifeng County. At that time, Kaifeng, the capital of Bian Prefecture (Ê±¥Â∑û), was a key transportation point for both water and land transport, and the population was highly diverse and difficult to govern. Both Li Mian and his colleague from a nearby county, Lu Chenggui (ÁõßÊàêËªå), were both known for their abilities to capture criminals and maintain order.  During Emperor Suzong's reign  In 755, the general An Lushan rebelled at Fanyang, and by summer 756, the forces of his new state of Yan were approaching the Tang capital Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xuanzong to flee to Chengdu. Emperor Xuanzong's son and crown prince Li Heng, however, did not follow him to Chengdu, but fled to Lingwu instead, where he was declared emperor (as Emperor Suzong). Li Mian followed Emperor Suzong to Lingwu, and was made Jiancha Yushi (Áõ£ÂØüÂæ°Âè≤), an imperial censor. At that time, everything at Emperor Suzong's court, including his palace, was makeshift, and the officers lacked discipline. On one occasion, the officer Guan Chongsi (ÁÆ°Â¥áÂó£) was sitting with his back to the palace, considered a disrespectful posture. Li Mian submitted an indictment against Guan, and Emperor Suzong, while pardoning Guan for his indiscretion, stated, \\"It is because I have Li Mian that the court even has any discipline.\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 218. In 757, after Tang forces recaptured Chang'an and were attacking east and seeking to recapture the eastern capital Luoyang, which had become the Yan capital, there was an occasion when over 100 Yan captives were delivered to Chang'an, to be executed on Emperor Suzong's orders. Li Mian submitted a petition stating:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 220. Emperor Suzong thus pardoned the captives. Subsequently, after Tang forces recaptured Luoyang, Li Mian served as the deputy mayor of Henan Municipality (Ê≤≥Âçó, i.e., the Luoyang region), and later successively served as military commander under the generals Wang Sili (ÁéãÊÄùÁ¶Æ) and Li Guozhen (ÊùéÂúãË≤û). He later became the commandant at Liang Prefecture (Ê¢ÅÂ∑û, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) and governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Shannan West Circuit (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Hanzhong). On one occasion, when Wang Zui (ÁéãÊô¨), a capable junior official that he had made the magistrate of Liang Prefecture's seat Nanzheng County (ÂçóÈÑ≠), was falsely accused by powerful men at court and ordered executed by Emperor Suzong's edict, Li Mian, instead of following the edict, detained Wang but stopped the execution, and immediately submitted a petition defending Wang. Wang was subsequently spared.New Book of Tang, vol. 131 . However, as a result, in 762, Li Mian was recalled to Chang'an to serve as Dali Shaoqing (Â§ßÁêÜÂ∞ëÂçø), the deputy chief judge of the supreme court (Â§ßÁêÜÂØ∫, Dali Si).This account of Li Mian's recall is according to his biography in the Old Book of Tang, but his biography in the New Book of Tang, which was followed by the Zizhi Tongjian, indicated that he was removed because he abandoned Liang Prefecture when Nula (Â•¥Êãâ) tribe attacked it. Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 131 with New Book of Tang, vol. 131 and Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 222. Once Li Mian was at Chang'an, he met Emperor Suzong to proclaim Wang's innocence and list Wang's accomplishments. Emperor Suzong approved of him and made him the deputy minister of worship (Â§™Â∏∏Âçø, Taichang Qing). Emperor Suzong wanted to promote him further, but as Li Mian would not be submissive to the powerful eunuch Li Fuguo, and so Li Mian was sent out of the capital to serve as the prefect of Fen Prefecture (Ê±æÂ∑û, in modern Linfen, Shanxi).  During Emperor Daizong's reign  Emperor Suzong died later in 762 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Daizong. During Emperor Daizong's reign, Li Mian successively served as the prefect of Guo Prefecture (Ëô¢Â∑û, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, i.e., the Chang'an region), and the mayor of Henan Municipality. Subsequently, he served as deputy chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤‰∏≠‰∏û, Yushi Zhongcheng), and then the governor of Jiangxi Circuit (Ê±üË•ø, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi). While serving at Jiangxi Circuit, he had to combat several rebellions and was able to suppress them with help from other circuits. On one occasion, when the father of one of his subordinates was ill, the subordinate used witchcraft to try to cure his father, and the witchcraft including making a doll with Li Mian's name on it and burying it. When the doll was found, Li Mian stated, \\"He was doing this for his father's cure, and this can be forgiven.\\" In 767, Li Mian was in Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Daizong, and was made the mayor of Jingzhao as well as the chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤Â§ßÂ§´, Yushi Daifu). He was said to be simple and solemn in his governance. At that time, the powerful eunuch Yu Chao'en was the monitor of the armies as well as acting principal of the imperial university (ÂúãÂ≠êÁõ£, Guozi Jian). Due to the authority he had, he was arrogant and demanded respect. Li Mian's predecessors as mayor all, when Yu visited the university, held feasts with food sufficient for several hundred people. When Yu visited the university on Li Mian's watch, however, Li Mian refused ‚Äî pointing out that as the principal, Yu was the host when he visited the university, and that if he were ever to visit the Jingzhao municipal government, he would surely hold a feast in Yu's honor. When Yu heard this, he resented Li Mian and did not visit the university. Soon, Li Mian was removed. In 769, Li Mian was made the military governor of Lingnan Circuit (Â∂∫Âçó, headquartered in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong), as well as the prefect of Lingnan's capital Guang Prefecture (Âª£Â∑û). At that time, two rebels, Feng Chongdao (È¶ÆÂ¥áÈÅì) and Zhu JIshi (Êú±ÊøüÊôÇ), had been holding more than 10 prefectures. After Li Mian's arrival, he supported his subordinates Li Guan (ÊùéËßÄ) and Wang Hong (ÁéãÁøÉ) in suppressing the rebels, and was able to calm the circuit by 771.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 224. It was said that because Li Mian was honest in his governance of the circuit, previously, only four or five foreign merchant ships would arrive in Guang Prefecture per year, but toward the end of his term, because Li Mian did not demand bribes, more than 40 foreign merchant ships would arrive each year. Later, when he was recalled to Chang'an, on the journey back, as he was going through Shimen (Áü≥ÈñÄ, in modern Changde, Hunan), he threw treasures that his family members had collected into the Yangtze River to show that he did not treasure them. This led popular opinion at the time to compare him to such honest officials of the past such as Song Jing, Lu Huan (ÁõßÂ•ê), and Li Chaoyin (ÊùéÊúùÈö±). The people and officials of Guang Prefecture requested Emperor Daizong's permission to build a monument in Li Mian's honor, and Emperor Daizong agreed. In 775, Emperor Daizong made him the minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Gongbu Shangshu) and created him the Duke of Qian. In 773, when Linghu Zhang (‰ª§ÁãêÂΩ∞) the military governor of Yongping Circuit (Ê∞∏Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan) was near death, Linghu recommended Emperor Daizong to replace him with either Li Mian or Liu Yan, and Emperor Daizong made Li Mian the military governor of Yongping to replace Linghu. In 776, Tian Shenyu (Áî∞Á•ûÁéâ) the acting military governor of Biansong Circuit (Ê±¥ÂÆã, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), died. Tian's subordinate Li Lingyao (ÊùéÈùàÊõú) killed Tian's son and took over the circuit. Emperor Daizong initially reacted by making Li Mian the acting military governor of Biansong and commissioning Li Lingyao as the prefect of Pu Prefecture (ÊøÆÂ∑û, in modern Heze, Shandong). When Li Lingyao refused, Emperor Daizong gave in and made him the acting military governor of Biansong, but when Li Lingyao subsequently refused to follow imperial orders, Emperor Daizong commissioned governors of the surrounding circuits ‚Äî Li Mian, Li Zhongchen, Ma Sui, Chen Shaoyou (Èô≥Â∞ëÈÅä), and Li Zhengji ‚Äî to attack Li Lingyao. Later that year, with Li Zhongchen and Ma directly attacking Biansong's capital Bian Prefecture, they defeated Li Lingyao and forced him to flee. Li Lingyao was captured in flight by Li Mian's subordinate Du Rujiang (ÊùúÂ¶ÇÊ±ü), and Li Mian had Li Lingyao delivered to Chang'an to be executed. Initially, the western half of Biansong was merged into Li Zhongchen's Huaixi Circuit (Ê∑ÆË•ø, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan), but after Li Zhongchen's subordinate Li Xilie mutinied and expelled him in 779, Emperor Dezong, while allowing Li Xilie to take over Huaixi, stripped Bian and Ying (ÊΩÅÂ∑û, in modern Fuyang, Anhui) Prefectures from Huaixi and added them to Yongping. He also had Li Mian move Yongping's headquarters to Bian Prefecture.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 225.  During Emperor Dezong's reign  = As military governor of Yongping Circuit = Later in 779, Emperor Daizong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Dezong. Emperor Dezong made Li Mian an honorary chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã). Emperor Dezong soon took a harder line against the military governors of several circuits which were effectively governed independently from the imperial government ‚Äî Li Zhengji's Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), Li Baochen's Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), Tian Yue's Weibo Circuit (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), and Liang Chongyi's Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei). After Li Baochen and Li Zhengji both died in 781, he refused to let their respective sons, Li Weiyue and Li Na, inherit their fathers' positions, and those semi-independent circuits mobilized to prepare for war against the imperial government. As part of the preparation for war, Emperor Dezong divided Yongping, making three of its seven prefectures ‚Äî Song (ÂÆãÂ∑û, in modern Shangqiu, Henan), Bo (‰∫≥Â∑û, in modern Bozhou, Anhui), and Ying Prefectures ‚Äî into a new Xuanwu Circuit, giving Si Prefecture (Ê≥óÂ∑û, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu) to Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), and adding Zheng Prefecture (ÈÑ≠Â∑û, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan) to Yongping. He also made Li Mian the overall commander of the forces not only of his own circuit, but also of Xuanwu and Heyang (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Luoyang) Circuits.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 226. When Liu Qia (ÂäâÊ¥Ω) the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit was subsequently able to put LI Na under siege at Pu Prefecture, Li Mian persuaded Li Na to offer to submit to imperial authority, but Emperor Dezong, convinced of victory at that point, refused to accept Li Na's surrender. Subsequently, Li Na was able to regroup and continue to resist the imperial government. When Emperor Dezong subsequently ordered Li Xilie to attack Li Na, Li Xilie, who was secretly aligned with Li Na, pretended to be ready to attack Pinglu through Yongping, and he requested Li Mian to permit him passage, while he was preparing to launch a surprise attack on Yongping instead. Li Mian prepared to welcome Li Xilie through his circuit but mobilized his own troops to prepare for an attack. Li Xilie, realizing that Li Mian was taking precautions, did not attack Yongping at this point.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 227. By 783, when Li Xilie was openly defying the imperial government, the chancellor Lu Qi, resentful of the senior official Yan Zhenqing, suggested Emperor Dezong to send Yan to Huaixi to try to persuade Li Xilie to resubmit. Li Mian, seeking that Yan's mission would be fruitless and that he was heading for certain death, submitted an objection and tried to intercept Yan on the way, but was unable to do so. Yan was subsequently detained by Li Xilie, although Li Xilie's subordinates Zhou Zeng (Âë®Êõæ), Wang Bin (ÁéãÁé¢), and Yao Dan (ÂßöÊÜ∫) were in secret communications with Li Mian and hoping to replace Li Xilie and replace him with Yan. Soon, their plot was discovered, however, and Li Xilie killed them. Subsequently, when the imperial general Emperor Dezong sent to attack Li Xilie, Geshu Yao (Âì•ËàíÊõú), was put under siege by LI Xilie at Xiangcheng (Ë•ÑÂüé, in modern Xuchang, Henan), Emperor Dezong ordered Li Mian and Liu Dexin (ÂäâÂæ∑‰ø°) to aid Geshu. Li Mian, believing that since Li Xilie was attacking Xiangcheng, Xu Prefecture (Ë®±Â∑û, in modern Xuchang) would be easy to capture, and once Xu Prefecture fell, Li Xilie would be forced to lift the siege on Xiangcheng. He therefore ordered Liu and Tang Hanchen (ÂîêÊº¢Ëá£) to attack Xu Prefecture. Before Liu and Tang could reach Xu Prefecture, however, Emperor Dezong sent an edict ordering them to stop. Liu and Tang were surprised and dismayed, and they withdrew, and they became careless in their retreat. They were ambushed by Li Xilie's officer Li Kecheng (ÊùéÂÖãË™†), and suffered massive losses. With Li Mian fearful that Luoyang would be under attack, he sent an army under Li Jian (ÊùéÂ†Ö) with 4,000 men to Luoyang to aid it, but subsequently, with the return path cut off by Li Xilie, they were unable to return to Bian Prefecture. From that point on, Yongping itself was in a precarious position, unable to aid Geshu and finding it difficult to stand against Li Xilie.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 228. By late 783, Li Xilie was putting Bian Prefecture under siege. Li Mian held the city against the siege for more than a month, but with no aid forces arriving, he abandoned Bian Prefecture and took over 10,000 people to flee to Xuanwu's capital Song Prefecture. Li Mian submitted a petition to Emperor Dezong ‚Äî who was at Fengtian (Â•âÂ§©, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) at the time due to rebellion by Zhu Ci, who had seized Chang'an and declared himself the emperor of a new state of Qin ‚Äî requesting punishment. Emperor Dezong responded, \\"I was unable to defend the imperial ancestral temples. Li Mian needs not be insecure.\\" Li Mian subsequently transferred his troops to Liu Qia.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 229. By fall 784, with Li Mian repeatedly requesting punishment, Emperor Dezong removed him from the overall command of the three circuits and the military governorship of Yongping, but recalled him to Chang'an (which had been recaptured by that point) to serve as chancellor as well as acting Situ (Âè∏Âæí, one of the Three Excellencies). When Li Mian arrived at Chang'an, many officials commented, \\"Li Mian lost Daliang [(Â§ßÊ¢Å, another name for Bian Prefecture)] and should not remain as chancellor.\\" Emperor Dezong's trusted senior advisor Li Mi pointed out that while Li Mian was not a capable general, he was a capable governor that the people loved and respected, and that he, by transferring the command to Liu, contributed to Liu's subsequent victory. Emperor Dezong agreed with Li Mi and allowed Li Mian to exercise his authority as chancellor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 231. = Chancellorship and after chancellorship = Li Mian, while he was then in the chancellor's office, did not dare to exert his authority, and he often simply yielded to the other chancellors. In 784, when fellow chancellor Xiao Fu suggested that Chen Shaoyou be replaced as military governor of Huainan Circuit with Wei Gao, Emperor Dezong ordered Xiao to only discuss the matter with another chancellor, Liu Congyi, excluding Li Mian and Lu Han from the discussion, and Xiao's refusal to do so eventually led to Xiao's resignation. In 785, when Emperor Dezong, over the objections of the officials Yuan Gao (Ë¢ÅÈ´ò), Chen Jing (Èô≥‰∫¨), and Zhao Xu (Ë∂ôÈúÄ), was set to promote Lu Qi, who had been demoted to be a prefectural military advisor and exiled because he was blamed for the rebellions of Zhu Ci and Li Huaiguang, to be prefect, Li Mian backed Yuan and his colleagues. When Emperor Dezong asked the chancellors, \\"Is it all right to make Lu Qi the prefect of a small prefecture?\\" Li Mian responded, \\"If Your Imperial Majesty really want to use him, even a large prefecture is all right. But you should consider how disappointed the realm would be.\\" Further, when Emperor Dezong asked Li Mian, \\"Everyone accuses Lu Qi of treacherousness, but I do not see it. Do you, Lord, see it?\\" Li Mian responded, \\"Everyone under heaven knows that he is treacherous, but Your Imperial Majesty does not. This is, indeed, proof of his treacherousness.\\"However, the Zizhi Tongjian credited this exchange not to Li Mian, but to Li Mi. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 233. This caused Li Mian to be further admired for his honesty, but also because of such bluntness, Emperor Dezong distanced himself from Li Mian. In 786, when Emperor Dezong reorganized his government and put the six ministries of the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng) directly under the chancellors, Li Mian was given control of the ministry of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®, Xingbu).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 232. Subsequently, with Li Mian repeatedly offering to resign, he was removed from his chancellor post and made a senior advisor to Emperor Dezong's crown prince Li Song. Li Mian died later in 786 and was buried with great honors. Li Mian was known for his abilities in guqin and poetry, and he wrote a number of musical pieces. It was said that during his time in high positions, for more than 20 years, he distributed his salaries to his relatives and subordinates, leaving little for himself, such that when he died, there were no savings, and that despite his honored status, he was constantly humble in dealing with subordinates. He had invited two famed individuals, Li Xun (ÊùéÂ∑°) and Zhang Can (ÂºµÂèÉ), as secretaries, and after both Li Xun and Zhang died while serving him, for three years, during feasts, he would have places set for them at the table and offered meals and wine to their spirits.

The other good reason for this choice is that I haven't written enough original material to fill an album.\\" On the selection of songs, Holdsworth stated: \\"We absolutely didn't want to play all the classic standards everybody is playing already ... I definitely didn't want to do any of my own tunes this time.\\" On the type of jazz being played: \\"It's not a trad album. It's a bebop album, but with a wrench or two in there.\\" According to Holdsworth, Beck's use of a digital piano (as opposed to a regular one) was something to which the latter was not accustomed.

This decomposition results in the system being presented with a more illuminating structure, making it easier to draw conclusions on the system's reachable and observable subspaces.  Notation  The derivation is identical for both discrete-time as well as continuous time LTI systems.

Then, the Kalman decomposition is defined as a transformation of the tuple \\\\, (A, B, C, D) to \\\\, (\\\\hat{A}, \\\\hat{B}, \\\\hat{C}, \\\\hat{D}) as follows: : \\\\, {\\\\hat{A}} = TA{T}^{-1} : \\\\, {\\\\hat{B}} = TB : \\\\, {\\\\hat{C}} = C{T}^{-1} : \\\\, {\\\\hat{D}} = D \\\\, T^{-1} is an \\\\, n \\\\times n invertible matrix defined as : \\\\, T^{-1} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} T_{r\\\\overline{o}} & T_{ro} & T_{\\\\overline{ro}} & T_{\\\\overline{r}o}\\\\end{bmatrix} where * \\\\, T_{r\\\\overline{o}} is a matrix whose columns span the subspace of states which are both reachable and unobservable. * \\\\, T_{ro} is chosen so that the columns of \\\\, \\\\begin{bmatrix} T_{r\\\\overline{o}} & T_{ro}\\\\end{bmatrix} are a basis for the reachable subspace. * \\\\, T_{\\\\overline{ro}} is chosen so that the columns of \\\\, \\\\begin{bmatrix} T_{r\\\\overline{o}} & T_{\\\\overline{ro}}\\\\end{bmatrix} are a basis for the unobservable subspace. * \\\\, T_{\\\\overline{r}o} is chosen so that \\\\,\\\\begin{bmatrix} T_{r\\\\overline{o}} & T_{ro} & T_{\\\\overline{ro}} & T_{\\\\overline{r}o}\\\\end{bmatrix} is invertible. By construction, the matrix \\\\, T^{-1} is invertible. It can be observed that some of these matrices may have dimension zero. For example, if the system is both observable and controllable, then \\\\, T^{-1} = T_{ro}, making the other matrices zero dimension. Standard Form By using results from controllability and observability, it can be shown that the transformed system \\\\, (\\\\hat{A}, \\\\hat{B}, \\\\hat{C}, \\\\hat{D}) has matrices in the following form: : \\\\, \\\\hat{A} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}A_{r\\\\overline{o}} & A_{12} & A_{13} & A_{14} \\\\ 0 & A_{ro} & 0 & A_{24} \\\\ 0 & 0 & A_{\\\\overline{ro}} & A_{34}\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & A_{\\\\overline{r}o}\\\\end{bmatrix} : \\\\, \\\\hat{B} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}B_{r\\\\overline{o}} \\\\ B_{ro} \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\\\end{bmatrix} : \\\\, \\\\hat{C} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}0 & C_{ro} & 0 & C_{\\\\overline{r}o}\\\\end{bmatrix} : \\\\, \\\\hat{D} = D This leads to the conclusion that * The subsystem \\\\, (A_{ro}, B_{ro}, C_{ro}, D) is both reachable and observable. * The subsystem \\\\, \\\\left(\\\\begin{bmatrix}A_{r\\\\overline{o}} & A_{12}\\\\ 0 & A_{ro}\\\\end{bmatrix},\\\\begin{bmatrix}B_{r\\\\overline{o}} \\\\ B_{ro}\\\\end{bmatrix},\\\\begin{bmatrix}0 & C_{ro}\\\\end{bmatrix}, D\\\\right) is reachable. * The subsystem \\\\, \\\\left(\\\\begin{bmatrix}A_{ro} & A_{24}\\\\ 0 & A_{\\\\overline{r}o}\\\\end{bmatrix},\\\\begin{bmatrix}B_{ro} \\\\ 0 \\\\end{bmatrix},\\\\begin{bmatrix}C_{ro} & C_{\\\\overline{r}o}\\\\end{bmatrix}, D\\\\right) is observable.

It is situated north of Wetherby, east of Harrogate, from Knaresborough and from York. History The name of Cowthorpe comes from Old Norse and is a combination of a personal name Koli and √æorp (which means settlement or outlying hamlet). The village lies on a minor road that connects it with North Deighton (and the A168) to the west and Tockwith in the east. It is bordered by the River Nidd to the north with bridges crossing the Nidd at either Walshford in the west, or Cattal Bridge in the east. St Michael's Church  St Michael's Church in the village is a Grade I listed building, built by a Brian Roucliffe, and consecrated in 1458. In the choir, on a large flat stone, are the effigies, in brass, of a man and his wife, bearing betwixt them the model of a church, and supposed, from the inscription, likewise in brass, now scarce legible, to be in memory of the Founder and his wife. The Cowthorpe Oak The Cowthorpe Oak Cowthorpe was the home of an enormous tree, the Cowthorpe Oak. Its circumference was ; its principal limb (which was propped) extended from the bole. The tree was decaying by the 19th century; tradition speaks of its being in decay for many generations. \\"Compared with this,\\" says Dr. Hunter, in Evelyn's Silva, \\"all other trees are children of the Forest.\\" According to an early history of Knaresborough, \\"The leading branch fell, by a storm, in the year 1718; which, being measured with accuracy, was found to contain five tons and two feet of wood. Before this accidental mutilation, its branches are said to have extended their shade over half an acre of ground; thus constituting, in a single tree, almost a wood itself\\". Langdale's Topographical Dictionary of Yorkshire (1822) records that \\"This venerable oak is decaying fast, the trunk and several of the branches appearing to be completely rotten, except the bark; tradition speaks of its being in decay for many generations. The intermixture of foliage amongst the dead branches, show how sternly this giant struggles for life, and how reluctantly it surrenders to all conquering time\\". However, the tree was still flourishing in part as late as 1906: it was photographed in that year, and 'the tree [was] still in good shape, with a lot of strong branches and foliage, although many of the branches are now propped up...the oak still puts forth leaves and periodically sports a few acorns.'https://justbod.blogspot.com/2015/04/in-search-of- cowthorpe-oak.html.

Members of the genus are widespread in distribution, especially in northern temperate regions. Known to be psychrotolerant and associated with Arctic permafrost soils,National Geographic: they are equally prevalent in the air of domestic dwellings, and children's sandpits. Species of Geomyces have previously been placed in the genus Chrysosporium. Description This genus is characterized by short but distinct branched conidiophores that have chains of spores formed directly from the cells of the branches. Sometimes only the tips of the branches become spores. The spores (conidia) are 1-celled, and either white or yellow. The teleomorph of species in this genus, if they exist, are in Pseudogymnoascus or Gymnostellatospora. Geomyces species are known to form ericoid mycorrhizae with the roots of alpine Ericales and other perennial hosts, helping these plants adapt to low-nutrient environments. The Geomyces are keratinophilic fungi, able to degrade hairs and nails. They have been investigated for possible use in the biodecomposition of waste poultry feathers. Adaptive capabilities Research has shown that laboratory cultures of G. pannorum isolated from various environments may have extreme differences in morphology and physiology. In fact, the limits of cold adaptation in a particular isolate can vary depending on the source of isolation, even though the isolates are genetically identical. Studies suggest that one biochemical mechanism of low-temperature tolerance is achieved by altering the composition and total content of fatty-acids in their membrane, a phenomenon called homeoviscous adaptation. White-nose syndrome A 2008 study of white-nose syndrome, a fungal infection causing high mortality rates in bats, determined that the fungus found on the muzzles, wings, and ears of infected bats is a member of the genus Geomyces. Later, the conidial morphology of this isolate was shown to be morphologically distinct from the conidia of other characterized members of the genus, despite the phylogenetic similarity. Finally, in spring 2009 the source of the infection was identified as a new species, Geomyces destructans. It is known however that Geomyces species are found in caves and bat hibernacula, and have been isolated from the cave cricket Troglophilus neglectus. Biocorrosion Using phylogenetic analyses of ribosomal DNA sequences, Geomyces species have been implicated in the biodeterioration of antique and optical glass. Feeding off organic residues ubiquitously present on historical glass, such as dust or dead fungal and bacterial material, fungal colonization by Geomyces may ultimately lead to etching, pit corrosion, or the formation of cracks or patinas due to secretion of acidic metabolic byproducts, or penetration of fungal mycelia into the paint layer. Bioactive compounds A number of asterric acid derivatives, some with antibacterial or antifungal activity, have been isolated from an unidentified Geomyces isolate found in a soil sample from King George Island, Antarctica: ethyl asterrate, n-butyl asterrate, and geomycins A-C.

Realizing these innovative products offered significant advantages in efficiency and cleanliness over the open fires commonly used in Europe, he returned to his native land, and arranged for the manufacture of his own versions, initially at the Bonnybridge foundry of George Ure. In 1854 Ure, Smith and a third partner, Stephen Wellstood formed 'Smith & Wellstood' as a new company and named a branch in honour of the land found by Columbus; 'The Columbian Stove Works'. The 'Esse' brand name was chosen simply because it was thought to sound French, and being derived from the Latin, to be thoroughly European. The business prospered throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, so that the company were able to claim that every single Royal household in Europe owned an Esse, and included Auguste Escoffier, Mrs Beeton, Florence Nightingale and Ernest Shackleton among their famous clients.

Kriegsmarine) before and during World War I. The class was a part of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's efforts to competitively evaluate three foreign submarine designs. The design of the boats was based upon John Philip Holland's submarine design and featured a single, teardrop hull, which resembled the design of modern nuclear submarines.Sieche, p. 21. The class members were just over long and displaced surfaced and submerged. All were originally equipped with two bow torpedo tubes and could carry four torpedoes. The first two boats, U-5 and U-6, built specifically for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, to the same design as the United States C-class submarine were partially constructed in the United States and completed at Whitehead & Co. at Fiume. The third was completely constructed by Whitehead's at Fiume and purchased by Austria-Hungary to bolster their U-boat fleet after the outbreak of World War I. All three boats had successes during World War I; between them they sank five ships with a combined tonnage of 22,391. In addition they captured seven ships as prizes and damaged , a French dreadnought of 22,189 tons displacement. All three boats were sunk during the war, though U-5, the lead boat of the class, was raised and recommissioned after her sinking. After the war's end, U-5, the only survivor of the class, was ceded to Italy as a war reparation and was broken up in 1920.  Design and construction  In 1904, after allowing the navies of other countries to pioneer submarine developments, the Austro-Hungarian Navy ordered the Austrian Naval Technical Committee (MTK) to produce a submarine design. The January 1905 design developed by the MTK and other designs submitted by the public as part of a design competition were all rejected by the Navy as impracticable. They instead opted to order two submarines each of designs by Simon Lake, Germaniawerft, and John Philip Holland for a competitive evaluation. The two Holland submarines comprised the U-5 class.Gardiner, p. 340.The Lake design became the while the Germaniawerft design became the . The Navy authorized two boats, U-5 and U-6, from Whitehead & Co. of Fiume in 1906.Gibson and Prendergast, p. 384. The U-5 class was built to the same design as the C class for the US Navy and was built by Robert Whitehead's firm of Whitehead & Co. under license from Holland and his company, Electric Boat. Components for the first two Austrian boats were manufactured by the Electric Boat Company and assembled at Fiume, while the third boat was a speculative private venture by Whitehead that failed to find a buyer and was purchased by Austria-Hungary upon the outbreak of World War I. The U-5-class boats had a single-hulled design with a teardrop-shape that bore a strong resemblance to modern nuclear submarines. The boats were just over long and displaced surfaced, and submerged. The torpedo tubes featured unique, cloverleaf-shaped design hatches that rotated on a central axis. The ships were powered by twin 6-cylinder gasoline engines while surfaced, but suffered from inadequate ventilation which resulted in frequent intoxication of the crew. While submerged, they were propelled by twin electric motors. The first two boats, U-5 and U-6, were ordered by the Austro-Hungarian Navy for evaluation and were partially assembled in the United States, shipped to Fiume, and riveted together by Whitehead & Co., which, author Edwin Sieche reports, \\"caused a lot of trouble\\". U-5 was launched in February 1909 and was followed in June by the launch of U-6. Both boats were commissioned by April 1910.Sieche, pp. 21‚Äì22. The third boat, originally named SS-3, was built on speculation entirely at Whitehead's in Fiume. The boat's design featured improvements in the electrical and mechanical systems. Gibson and Prendergast report that, when built, SS-3 was powered by electric motors for both surface and submerged running. When the surface performance of the electric motors proved disappointing in trials, SS-3s power-plant was rebuilt to match the gasoline/electric combination used in U-5 and U-6.Gibson and Prendergast, pp. 384‚Äì85. SS-3 was launched in March 1911 and was offered to the Austro- Hungarian Navy, but because the evaluation of the first two U-5-class boats was still underway, they declined to purchase. As built, the U-5-class boats were armed with two bow torpedo tubes and could carry a supply of four torpedoes. By 1915, all had received a 3.7 cm/23 (1.5 in) deck gun.  Service career  U-5 and U-6 were both commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy by April 1910, and served as training boats through 1914, making as many as ten training cruises per month. During their early years, each boat was demonstrated to a foreign naval delegation; U-5 to a Peruvian detachment in 1911, U-6 to a Norwegian group in 1910. At the beginning of World War I in August 1914, U-5 and U-6 comprised half of the operational U-boat fleet of the Austro-Hungarian Navy.Gardiner, p. 341. In the three years after SS-3s March 1911 launch, Whitehead's attempted to sell the boat to the navies of Peru, Portugal, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Bulgaria, before the Austro-Hungarian Navy rejected an offer for the second time. With the outbreak of war, however, the Austro-Hungarian Navy purchased the unsold submarine to quickly bolster its fleet. Although provisionally commissioned as U-7, she was commissioned as U-12 in August 1914. By late December 1914, all three of the U-5-class boats were based at the naval base at Cattaro and all took part in combat patrols. Between the three boats, they sank five ships with a combined tonnage of 22,391,Merchant ship tonnage is in gross register tons. Warship tonnage is in tons of displacement. captured seven ships, and damaged one dreadnought. U-6 was the least successful, sinking a single ship of ; U-5 was the most successful, sinking four ships with of a combined , including the French armoured cruiser .Sieche, p. 22. U-12 damaged, but did not sink, the largest ship torpedoed by any of the U-5 class when she hit the French battleship on 21 December 1914. Of the three boats of the class, only U-5 survived the war intact. U-12 was sunk with the loss of all hands when she hit a mine near Venice in August 1915,Grant, p. 162.Grant (p. 162), Gibson and Prendergast (p. 73), and Halpern (p. 150) report U-12s loss in August 1915, while Sieche (p. 23) and Gardiner (p. 343) report the loss in August 1916. while U-6 was scuttled by her crew in May 1916 after becoming trapped in an anti-submarine net that was a part of the Otranto Barrage. U-5 herself sank after hitting an Austro-Hungarian mine during a training exercise, but was raised, repaired and recommissioned before the war's end. U-5 was ceded to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920.  Class members  = SM U-5 = SM U-5 was laid down in April 1907 and launched in February 1909. She was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in April 1910, and served as a training boat‚Äîsometimes making as many as ten cruises a month‚Äîthrough the beginning of the First World War in 1914. The submarine scored most of her wartime successes during the first year of the war while under the command of Georg Ritter von Trapp. The French armoured cruiser , sunk in April 1915, was the largest ship sunk by U-5. In May 1917, U-5 hit a mine and sank with the loss of six men. She was raised, rebuilt, and recommissioned, but sank no more ships. At the end of the war, U-5 was ceded to Italy as a war reparation, and scrapped in 1920. In all, U-5 sank four ships totaling 21,604 tons. = SM U-6 = SM U-6 was laid down in February 1908 and launched the following June. She served as a training boat after her July 1910 commissioning into the Austro- Hungarian Navy. She served in that capacity through the beginning of World War I in 1914, making as many as ten training cruises a month. U-6 scored only one wartime success, sinking a French destroyer in March 1916. In May that same year, she became entangled in anti-submarine netting deployed as part of the Otranto Barrage. Coming under fire from drifters running the nets, U-6 was abandoned and sunk. All of her crewmen were rescued and were held in captivity through the end of the war. = SM U-12 = SM U-12 was built on speculation by Whitehead & Co. of Fiume under the name SS-3. She was laid down in 1909 and launched in March 1911 and featured improvements in the electrical and mechanical systems from the Holland design of her older sister boats, U-5 and U-6. Whitehead's tried selling SS-3 to several different navies, but she was finally bought by the Austro-Hungarian Navy after the outbreak of World War I, despite having been rejected twice before. She was commissioned as U-12 in August 1914. She sank only one ship during the war, a Greek cargo ship in May 1915, but had earlier captured six Montenegrin sailing vessels as prizes in March. U-12 also damaged, but did not sink, the French battleship in December 1914.Gibson and Prendergast, p. 69. While searching for targets in the vicinity of Venice in August 1915, U-12 struck a mine that blew her stern off, and sank with all hands, becoming the first Austro-Hungarian submarine sunk in the war.Halpern, p. 150. Her wreck was salvaged the next year by the Italians, who interred the bodies of U-12s crewmen in a Venetian cemetery.Sieche, p. 23.

Cover design by Thomas A. Sindelar. Camera Notes was a photographic journal published by the Camera Club of New York from 1897 to 1903. It was edited for most of that time by photographer Alfred Stieglitz and was considered the most significant American photography journal of its time. It is valuable today both as a record of photographic aesthetics of the time and for its many high-quality photogravures by photographers such as Stieglitz, James Craig Annan, F. Holland Day, Robert Demachy, Frances Benjamin Johnston, Gertrude Kasebier and Clarence H. White. Background In September, 1894, Alfred Stieglitz returned to New York after an extended tour in Europe. He found both the quality and quantity of what he considered to be artistic photography, such as that promoted by the Linked Ring in Britain, was much greater in Europe than in the United States, and he was determined to do something to advance fine art photography in America. He turned to the two major photographic clubs in New York, the Society of Amateur Photographers and the New York Camera Club, for assistance in his mission but received little interest from either organization. The critic Sadakichi Hartmann noted that the clubs at that time were \\"as good as dead. There was no vitality in them. Photography was merely as pastime to them, and all they had to show were their innumerable portraits, transcripts of nature, views, and snapshots as is in the power of almost anyone to produce.\\" Stieglitz set about to change this situation, and within eighteen months he and his friends succeeded in bringing about a merger of the two clubs. He immediately took over as Vice President of the newly formed and rejuvenated organization, now called The Camera Club of New York. He envisioned the new organization as the American beacon of fine art photography, and to help promote his vision he proposed expanding the former newsletter of the club into a full-fledged journal with himself as editor. Later Stieglitz would write \\"As a condition precedent to undertaking this labor of love and enthusiasm, it was stipulated by our Editor [Stieglitz] that he would have unhampered and absolute control over all matters, direct or remote, relating to the conduct of the proposed publications; in short, Camera Notes, while published for the club, was nevertheless an independent institution.\\" \\"Spring\\", by Clarence H. White. Published in Camera Notes, Vol 3 No 2, 1899. History and context The first issue of Camera Notes premiered in July, 1897. Camera Notes was immediately well-received, and in the second issue Stieglitz published a sampling of the praise that had come from other photographic magazines. Britain's Photogram, for example, said \\"Camera Notes is such a fine publication that we hesitate to use the adjectives necessary to describe it.\\" With the second issue Stieglitz hit his editorial stride, with a full range of photographs and articles that included F. Holland Day writing on \\"Art and the Camera\\" and Lee Ferguson lamenting on \\"Our Lack of Exhibitions\\". With Camera Notes Stieglitz established the pattern he would continue for the rest of his life of exerting complete editorial and aesthetic control over all aspects of the publication. Occasionally he would allow some articles to express ideas contrary to his, mostly for the sake of allowing him to rebut them, but in general his opinions dominated the visual and literary contributions to the magazine. Stieglitz also instilled in Camera Notes his belief that photographers should be familiar with other arts, since he saw his primary mission as promoting photography as a fine art itself. He included articles on Impressionism, Symbolism, genre painting and portraiture, and commentaries on aesthetics from well-known art critics and artists like Sadakichi Hartmann and Arthur Wesley Dow. At the same time, Stieglitz regularly took the opportunity to promote his own work, and while he was editor he published twenty-two of his own photos in the magazine, including two images twice. \\"Miss M\\", by Rose Clark and Elizabeth Flint Wade. Published in Camera Notes, Vol 4 No 4, 1900. For much of the first year, Stieglitz emphasized foreign photographers in the magazine as encouragement to his U.S. colleagues to develop a uniquely American school of photography. Within a short time, he was rewarded for his efforts by finding a new level of photographic aesthetics among his close colleagues. For the remainder of the publication's life, American photographers were dominated the highest quality reproductions included in Camera Notes. Of the fifty photographers whose work was included either as photogravures or as tipped-in silver prints, thirty-five were Americans. While Stieglitz sought independence from the Camera Club in his editorial work, very few of photographers whose work he reproduced came from outside the membership of the club. The most prominent of the non-Club members who were featured were F. Holland Day and Clarence H. White. Both figure prominently in Stieglitz's concurrent efforts to promote pictorialism through his establishment of the Photo-Secession. Eventually, Stieglitz's autocratic direction of the journal came under fire from the membership of the Club. In spite of the record of reproducing work mostly by Club members, some members felt Stieglitz was spending too much time and effort promoting activities outside of the Club. He also faced criticism from more progressive members who felt that much of the work Stieglitz chose fell into the same tired aesthetics that he originally campaigned against. In late 1900 a special meeting of the Club was held to address these issues, and, while he appeared open to a democratic discussion of the journal, Stieglitz became upset that his leadership and aesthetic integrity were being questioned. He eventually became disillusioned with all of the in-fighting, and in early 1901 he announced that he would step down as editor after one more year. In May, 1902, Juan C. Abel took over as editor. Abel, who was the Club's librarian, had assisted Stieglitz with two issues of Camera Notes and had experience working on other photographic magazines. He sought to emphasize the change in editorial direction by redesigning the magazine, putting a new cover in place along with a more sophisticated layout. He also introduced the relatively bold concept of including at least one tipped-in, original photographs in each issue. In spite his editorial changes, however, Abel did not have the aesthetic sense of Stieglitz, and the overall quality of the images included in the magazine, including the original prints, was inferior when compared to the previous five years. When Stieglitz began independently publishing his own journal Camera Work in 1903, interest in Camera Notes quickly flagged. The photographers and critics who were at the forefront of fine art photography at the time recognized that, for all his shortcomings, Stieglitz really was the driving force in the movement. The last issue of Camera Notes appeared in December 1903. A column under this name and written by members of the Camera Club subsequently appeared in two other magazines, but it contained only news and notes about the club itself. Cigale\\", by Frank Eugene. Published in Camera Notes, Vol 3 No 4, 1900. Design and production Each of the twenty-four issues of the magazine measured 10 ¬º‚Äù by 7 ¬Ω‚Äù (26 cm by 19 cm). Volumes 1-4 displayed a green Art Nouveau cover with a design attributed to Thomas A. Sindelar, a student of Alphonse Mucha. There were numerous halftone reproduction of photos in each issue, but what made the journal stand out were the hand-pulled photogravures. At least two and as many as four meticulously printed photogravures were included in each issue. In addition there were commentaries, criticism and reviews by important photographers and critics of the time. In an average issue, about half of the articles dealt with individual photographers and aesthetic issues, and the rest covering technical matters and notices and reviews of international exhibitions. As Stieglitz biographer Katherine Hoffman points out, \\"Each issue of Camera Notes was an art object itself, with its finely printed photogravures, well-designed layout and range of articles and text.\\" Issues and contents Camera Notes was published quarterly from July, 1897 to December, 1902, and two more issues were published in 1903, for a total of twenty-four issues.

The park is northwest of the town of Duchesne, Utah. Facilities Aerial view of the region south of the park, with Starvation Reservoir visible near the top. Oil and oil shale drilling platforms dot the landscape. The Starvation Reservoir is open year-round, and is popular for fishing and boating. It lies at an elevation of . Established in 1972, the marina features a 54-unit RV campground along with developed and primitive camping, rental cabins, boat ramp and dock, a sand beach, restrooms, showers, a group-use pavilion, sewage disposal, and fish cleaning stations. Primitive camping is allowed in designated areas around the perimeter of the reservoir for a fee. OHVs are only allowed at Knight Hollow Campground. County owned dirt roads are open (including the road from Knight Hollow to the town of Duchesne) in the nearby area. History There are various narratives explaining the name \\"Starvation\\". The most credible story was recounted by Orson Mott. In 1900 A.M. Murdock of Heber city, approached Major Myton of the Uintah Indian reservation to purchase grazing permits for his cattle. He was given grazing permits in the upper Strawberry river area. Dave Murdock, brother of Al Murdock had secured a contract to provide beef to the Ute tribe at Fort Duchesne. In the fall of 1904 they brought the herd out of the high grazing areas and made it to the river bottoms which is now covered by Starvation reservoir. Very heavy snows stranded the herd. With no feed the entire herd died. Dave Murdock named the area \\"Starvation Flats\\" from this experience.\\"Highlights from Interview with Orson Mott\\", Interviewed by JP Tanner 1995 Another account describes a group of fur trappers stranded in harsh winter conditions who survived by stealing a local Native American cache of food, which resulted in their starvation. Another account tells the opposite story, with the Indians doing the stealing and the trappers starving. A third story involves a local rancher who attempted to graze livestock in the area, and they all starved. Yet another explanation for the name involves settlers in the early 1900s trying to survive along the banks of the Strawberry River, in the area now occupied by the reservoir. These settlers dealt with near-starvation in a hostile environment. Winters in the area are long and cold, and their livestock often died. The area's short growing season was hindered by floods, hail, early frost and other problems. These settlers could have nicknamed the area Starvation. Starvation Dam The Starvation Dam () is a , earthfill dam. The reservoir is fed by the Strawberry River in the Uinta Basin, and is part of the Central Utah Project ‚Äì Bonneville Unit.

Reputation and coverage According to the 2009‚Äì10 Virginia Tech basketball program, Smith \\"is regarded by many as the greatest basketball player in school history.\\" In 2010, he was chosen to represent the Hokies at the annual 2010 Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament's Legends Class. In 2010, ESPN selected Chris Smith as the \\"Best Player\\" in the history of the Virginia Tech Basketball program. In 1959, Chris Smith was a First Team All-Southern Conference Selection. In 1960, he was a unanimous 1960 First Team All-Southern Conference Selection along with Jerry West. In 1961, Smith was the captain of the All-Southern Conference team. In 1960, he was selected as a Converse Second Team All-American. Sports Illustrated featured the Virginia Tech basketball team on December 26, 1960. That issue stated the following: > Clearly the best performer on the floor was Tech's 6-foot-6 center Chris > Smith, who scored 24 points and had 21 rebounds. The next night he led Tech > to an 81-54 victory over Baylor and was chosen as the Classic's most > valuable player.

A positive demand shock increases aggregate demand (AD) and a negative demand shock decreases aggregate demand. Prices of goods and services are affected in both cases. When demand for goods or services increases, its price (or price levels) increases because of a shift in the demand curve to the right. When demand decreases, its price decreases because of a shift in the demand curve to the left. Demand shocks can originate from changes in things such as tax rates, money supply, and government spending. For example, taxpayers owe the government less money after a tax cut, thereby freeing up more money available for personal spending. When the taxpayers use the money to purchase goods and services, their prices go up. In the midst of a poor economic situation in the United Kingdom in November 2002, the Bank of England's deputy governor, Mervyn King, warned that the domestic economy was sufficiently imbalanced that it ran the risk of causing a \\"large negative demand shock\\" in the near future. At the London School of Economics, he elaborated by saying, \\"Beneath the surface of overall stability in the UK economy lies a remarkable imbalance between a buoyant consumer and housing sector, on the one hand, and weak external demand on the other.\\" During the global financial crisis of 2008, a negative demand shock in the United States economy was caused by several factors that included falling house prices, the subprime mortgage crisis, and lost household wealth, which led to a drop in consumer spending. To counter this negative demand shock, the Federal Reserve System lowered interest rates. Before the crisis occurred, the world's economy experienced a positive global supply shock. Immediately afterward, however, a positive global demand shock led to global overheating and rising inflationary pressures.

The New England colonies were part of the Thirteen Colonies and eventually became five of the six states in New England.Gipson Captain John Smith's 1616 work A Description of New England first applied the term \\"New England\\"Bisceglia to the coastal lands from Long Island Sound to Newfoundland.Smith Arriving in America The English royal charters granted land to the north to Queen Elizabeth and land to the south to the London Company. England, France, and the Netherlands and Canada and Alaska made several attempts to colonize New England early in the 17th century, and those nations were often in contention over lands in the New World. French nobleman Pierre Dugua Sieur de Monts established a settlement on Saint Croix Island, Maine in June 1604 under the authority of the King of France. Nearly half the settlers perished due to the harsh winter and scurvy, and the survivors moved north out of New England to Port-Royal of Nova Scotia (see symbol \\"R\\" on map to the right) in the spring of 1605. King James I of England recognized the need for a permanent settlement in New England, and he granted competing royal charters to the Plymouth Company and the London Company. The Plymouth Company ships arrived at the mouth of the Kennebec River (then called the Sagadahoc River) in August 1607 where they established a settlement named Sagadahoc Colony, better known as Popham Colony (see symbol \\"Po\\" on map to right) to honor financial backer Sir John Popham. The colonists faced a harsh winter, the loss of supplies following a storehouse fire, and mixed relations with the local Native tribes. Colony leader Captain George Popham died, and Raleigh Gilbert decided to return to England to take up an inheritance left by an older brother‚Äîat which point, all of the colonists decided to return to England. It was around August 1608 when they left on the ship Mary and John and on a new ship built by the colony named Virginia of Sagadahoc. The 30-ton Virginia was the first sea-going ship ever built in North America. Conflict over land rights continued through the early 17th century, with the French constructing Fort Pentagouet near Castine, Maine in 1613. The fort protected a trading post and a fishing station and was the first longer-term settlement in New England. It changed hands multiple times throughout the 17th century among the English, French, and Dutch colonists. In 1614, Dutch explorer Adriaen Block traveled along the coast of Long Island Sound and then up the Connecticut River as far as Hartford, Connecticut. By 1623, the Dutch West India Company regularly traded for furs there, and they eventually fortified it for protection from the Pequot Indians and named the site \\"House of Hope\\" (also identified as \\"Fort Hoop,\\" \\"Good Hope,\\" and \\"Hope\\").New York Historical Society, p. 260 Establishing the New England Colonies A group of Puritans known as the Pilgrims arrived on the Mayflower from England and the Netherlands to establish Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts, the second successful English colony in North America following Jamestown, Virginia. About half of the one hundred-plus passengers on the Mayflower died that first winter, mostly because of diseases contracted on the voyage followed by a harsh winter. In 1621, a Native American named Squanto taught the colonists how to grow corn and where to catch eels and fish. His assistance was invaluable and helped them to survive the early years of the colonization. The Pilgrims lived on the same site where Squanto's Patuxet tribe had established a village before they were wiped out from diseases. The Plymouth settlement faced great hardships and earned few profits, but it enjoyed a positive reputation in England and may have sown the seeds for further immigration. Edward Winslow and William Bradford published an account of their experiences called Mourt's Relation (1622). This book was only a small glimpse of the hardships and dangers encountered by the Pilgrims, but it encouraged other Puritans to immigrate during the Great Migration between 1620 and 1640. Major boundaries of Massachusetts Bay and neighboring colonial claims in the 17th and 18th centuries; modern state boundaries are partially overlaid for context The Puritans in England first sent smaller groups in the mid-1620s to establish colonies, buildings, and food supplies, learning from the Pilgrims' harsh experiences of winter in the Plymouth Colony. In 1623, the Plymouth Council for New England (successor to the Plymouth Company) established a small fishing village at Cape Ann under the supervision of the Dorchester Company. The first group of Puritans moved to a new town at nearby Naumkeag after the Dorchester Company dropped support, and fresh financial support was found by Rev. John White. Other settlements were started in nearby areas; however, the overall Puritan population remained small through the 1620s. A larger group of Puritans arrived in 1630, leaving England because they desired to worship in a manner that differed from the Church of England. Their views were in accord with those of the Pilgrims who arrived on the Mayflower, except that the Mayflower Pilgrims felt that they needed to separate themselves from the Church of England, whereas the later Puritans were content to remain under the umbrella of the Church. The separate colonies were governed independently of one other until 1691, when Plymouth Colony was absorbed into the Massachusetts Bay Colony to form the Province of Massachusetts Bay. =Spreading out= The Puritans also established the American public school system for the express purpose of ensuring that future generations would be able to read the Bible for themselves, which was a central tenet of Puritan worship. However, dissenters of the Puritan laws were often banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. John Wheelwright left with his followers to establish a colony in New Hampshire and then went on to Maine. It was the dead of winter in January 1636 when Roger Williams was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony because of theological differences. One source of contention was his view that government and religion should be separate; he also believed that the colonies should purchase land at fair prices from the Wampanoag and Narragansett tribes. Massachusetts officials intended to forcibly deport him back to England, but he escaped and walked through deep snow from Salem, Massachusetts to Raynham, Massachusetts, a distance of 55 miles. The Indian tribes helped him to survive and sold him land for a new colony which he named Providence Plantations in recognition of the intervention of Divine Providence in establishing the new colony. It was unique in its day in expressly providing for religious freedom and a separation of church from state. Other dissenters established two settlements on Rhode Island (now called Aquidneck Island) and another settlement in Warwick; these four settlements eventually united to form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Map of the Connecticut, New Haven, and Saybrook colonies Thomas Hooker left Massachusetts in 1636 with 100 followers and founded a settlement just north of the Dutch Fort Hoop which grew into Connecticut Colony. The community was first named Newtown then renamed Hartford to honor the English town of Hertford. One of the reasons why Hooker left Massachusetts Bay was that only members of the church could vote and participate in the government, which he believed should include any adult male owning property. He obtained a royal charter and established Fundamental Orders, considered to be one of the first constitutions in America. Other colonies later merged into the royal charter for the Connecticut Colony, including New Haven and Saybrook Colony. Commerce The earliest colonies in New England were usually fishing villages or farming communities on the more fertile land along the rivers. The rocky soil in the New England Colonies was not as fertile as the Middle or Southern Colonies, but the land provided rich resources, including lumber that was valued for. Lumber was also a resource that could be exported back to England, where there was a shortage of wood. In addition, the hunting of wildlife provided furs to be traded and food for the table. The New England Colonies were located along the Atlantic coast where there was an abundance of marketable sea life. Excellent harbors and some inland waterways offered protection for ships and were also valuable for fresh water fishing. By the end of the 17th century, New England colonists had created an Atlantic trade network that connected them to the English homeland as well as to the West African slave coast, the Caribbean's plantation islands, and the Iberian Peninsula. Colonists relied upon British and European imports for glass, linens, hardware, machinery, and other items for the household. The Southern Colonies could produce tobacco, rice, and indigo in exchange for imports, whereas New England's colonies could not offer much to England beyond fish, furs, and lumber. Inflation was a major issue in the economy. During the 18th century, shipbuilding drew upon the abundant lumber and revived the economy, often under the direction of the British Crown.. N.p..

He asked that a writ of Quo warranto (a legal action requiring the defendant to show what authority they have for exercising some right, power, or franchise they claim to hold) be issued against Massachusetts for the violations.\\"https://historyofmassachusetts.org/massachusetts-bay-colony- charter-revoked/  Wartime enslavement of enemy combatants in New England  Enslavement of enemies defeated in war was a common practice in European nations at this time. This was a policy that had been going on for decades in Ireland, particularly since the time of Elizabeth I and during the mid-17th century Cromwell wars in Britain and Ireland, where large numbers of Irish, Welsh, and Scots prisoners of war were sent as slaves to plantations in the West Indies, especially to Barbados and Jamaica.Nathaniel Philbrick. Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War (Viking 2006) p. 253 The practice found its way to the American colonies during the Pequot War and King Philip's War. Military leader Benjamin Church spoke out against enslaving Indians in the summer of 1675, describing the practice as \\"an action so hateful‚Ä¶ that (I) opposed it to the loss of the good will and respect of some that before were (my) good friends.\\" This said, Church was an owner of African slaves himself, like many Englishmen in the colony.Nathaniel Philbrick. Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War (Viking 2006) pp 253, 345 Ships carrying captured war combatants began to leave New England ports during King Philip's War (1675‚Äì78) and continued for the three years of the war. The policy concerning war enemies was that \\"no male captive above the age of fourteen years should reside in the colony.\\"Nathaniel Philbrick. Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War (Viking 2006) p. 345 It is estimated that at least a thousand New England Indian warriors were sold as slaves during King Philip's War, with over half of those coming from Plymouth.Nathaniel Philbrick.

She has been voiced by several actresses, including Maggie Roswell, Tress MacNeille, Pamela Hayden, and most prominently, Glenn Close. Close's performances as Mona have been well received by critics and she was named one of the top 25 guest stars on the show by IGN. Mona was the estranged wife of Abe Simpson and the mother of Homer Simpson. In the episode \\"Mother Simpson\\", it was established that Homer believed that his mother was dead, a lie his father, Abe, told him when in reality she was on the run from the law after she sabotaged Mr Burns' biological warfare laboratory. Mona first appeared in the second season in a flashback in \\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\\". She returned in the seventh season for her first main appearance in \\"Mother Simpson\\" and also had a large role in \\"My Mother the Carjacker\\". The character appeared again in Season 19's \\"Mona Leaves-a\\", but died during the episode. An Inception-inspired dream version of her appears in Season 23's \\"How I Wet Your Mother\\". In the episode \\"Let's Go Fly a Coot\\", she is revealed to have met Abe when she was a waitress in a cantina and he broke the sound barrier to impress her. The character is named after writer Richard Appel's ex-wife, the American author (and Steve Jobs' biological sister) Mona Simpson. The inspiration for the character is Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground. Biography Many of the details of Mona's life are unknown, but various pieces of her story have been revealed. Mona was first mentioned in season one and made two brief flashback appearances, but her first major appearance was in \\"Mother Simpson\\". In the episode, it is revealed that in the 1960s, Mona was a homemaker who lived with her husband Abraham Simpson and Homer, who at the time was a child. She became caught up in the hippie movement after her beliefs were ignited by seeing Joe Namath's long hair during Super Bowl III. Mona soon after became a political activist and, at one event, Mona and a group of other activists protesting germ research entered Montgomery Burns's laboratory and destroyed all the biological warfare experiments. As the gang escaped, she stayed behind to help a fallen Burns, who in turn, swore to have her thrown in jail for the rest of her life. Since that night, Mona was forced to leave her family and run off with a jester. Abe lied and said Mona had died while Homer was at the movies, in order to spare him of the trauma that his mother was a wanted criminal. For 27 years, Homer presumed that his mother was dead. He was accidentally reunited with Mona in \\"Mother Simpson\\" after he faked his own death to get a day off from work and Mona visited his supposed gravesite. Overjoyed at their reunion, he brings Mona home to meet his family. At first, Mona does not reveal her whereabouts and spends time catching up with her family, but is forced to reveal her past. She later travels to the post office with Homer, where Mr. Burns recognizes her face and tracks her down with FBI assistance. However, a tip-off to Homer from Chief Wiggum allows Mona to escape. Wiggum is grateful to Mona because his asthma was cured by the \\"antibiotic bomb\\" her group detonated during their lab infiltration, thereby allowing him to join the police force. Forced to go on the run again, Mona tells Homer she loves him and escapes to the underground. Homer and Mona in the 1960s, as seen in \\"Mother Simpson\\" In \\"D'oh-in' in the Wind\\", it is revealed that at some point, Mona spent time at a commune with two hippies, Seth and Munchie, after life with Abraham became unbearable. It is also strongly implied that she was unfaithful to Abraham. In the episode \\"Homer's Paternity Coot\\", a long lost letter reveals that Mona had an affair with lifeguard Mason Fairbanks, leading Homer to falsely believe that he might, in fact, be his real father. In \\"My Mother the Carjacker\\", Homer discovers a secret message left for him in a newspaper that tells him to go to a location. There Homer finds Mona, who explains she had to return after she saw a macaroni pencil holder Homer made for her when he was five. She is captured by police and put on trial for the crime she committed. Due to Homer's heartfelt testimony, she is acquitted. Mr. Burns is angered by this and has her imprisoned for the minor charge of signing into a national park under a false name (Anita Bonghit). As she is being transported to jail, Homer attempts to break her free from the prison bus, but the chase ends in what appears to be her death when the bus drives off a cliff and lands in the water, where it explodes and sets off a rock avalanche which buries it. In truth, she narrowly escaped before the bus went off the cliff, and is still on the run. Mona returns in \\"Mona Leaves-a\\" to try to make up for lost time with Homer, but he angrily refuses, saying that she will just abandon him again. Homer feels guilty about being angry with her and tries to make up only to learn she has died. She is cremated and, according to her will, Homer is supposed to throw her ashes on a mountain, where they disrupt a missile guidance system which would have devastated the Amazon Rainforest, once again plotted by Burns. Although disappointed that the last thing his mother asked him to do was \\"another hippie protest\\", Homer successfully stops the launch. Mona briefly returned in \\"How I Wet Your Mother\\", where she rescues the family in a dream of Homer's, saying that she lives on in his dreams. It is revealed in this episode that a couple of weeks before she left Homer as a child, Homer and Grampa went on a fishing trip that was unsuccessful as the boat capsized. Homer would later felt guilt, believing that the incident prompted Mona to leave him and his father. Mona solves Homer's problem by telling him that the fishing trip never played a role in her leaving. Character =Creation= Mona in her first appearance in \\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" Mona Simpson is first mentioned in season one's \\"There's No Disgrace Like Home\\", where Homer recalls his mother telling him that he's a \\"big disappointment\\". She later made two brief flashback appearances, the first being season two's \\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" and the second being season six's \\"Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy\\", and in both cases she was voiced by Maggie Roswell. Mona's first major appearance was in the seventh season episode \\"Mother Simpson\\". The episode was pitched by Richard Appel, who had been desperately trying to think of a story idea and decided to do something about Homer's mother.Appel, Richard (2005). Commentary for \\"Mother Simpson\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Many of the writers were surprised that an episode about Homer's mother had not previously been produced. The writers used the episode as an opportunity to solve several puzzles about the show, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from. The character is named after Richard Appel's wife, who is the novelist Mona Simpson. The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground, although the writers acknowledge that several people fit her description. Her crime was intentionally the least violent crime the writers could think of, as she did not harm anyone and was only caught because she came back to help Mr. Burns. Mona Simpson was drawn in a way so that she has a little bit of Homer in her face, such as the shape of her upper lip and her nose.Silverman, David (2005). Commentary for \\"Mother Simpson\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. There were several design changes because the directors were trying to make her an attractive older and younger woman, but still be \\"Simpson-esque\\". =Voice= Glenn Close was convinced to voice the character in \\"Mother Simpson\\" partially because of James L. Brooks.Groening, Matt (2005). Commentary for \\"Mother Simpson\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. She was directed in her first performance by Josh Weinstein.Oakley, Bill (2005). Commentary for \\"Mother Simpson\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. When Mona gets in the van, her voice is done by Pamela Hayden because Glenn Close could not say \\"d'oh!\\" properly and thus they used the original temp track recorded by Hayden. Glenn Close recorded original material for three other episodes: season 15's \\"My Mother the Carjacker\\" and season 19's \\"Mona Leaves-a\\". A deleted scene featuring Mona from \\"Mother Simpson\\" appears in season seven's \\"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\\" as well as season thirty-one's \\"Todd, Todd, Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?\\". The character also has a speaking appearance in season ten's \\"D'oh-in in the Wind\\", this time voiced by Tress MacNeille. Reception Glenn Close has voiced Mona in nine episodes Glenn Close has been well-received as the voice of Mona. IGN.com ranked Close as the 25th best guest star in the show's history for her first two performances as Mona. In 2007, Entertainment Weekly called Close one of \\"fourteen guest stars whose standout performances on TV make us wish they'd turn up in a Simpsons Movie 2\\". In 2008, Entertainment Weekly also named Close one of the 16 best Simpsons guest stars. The Phoenix.com placed Close in the second position on their list of the best 20 Simpsons guest stars. Star News Online listed Close as one of the four hundred reasons why they love The Simpsons. Close appeared on AOL's list of their favorite 25 Simpsons guest stars. Robert Canning of IGN wrote that Close \\"gave us the sweet voice of Mona Simpson. She's a perfect fit, able to convey a loving, motherly tone, while still convincing the audience she's a headstrong hippie activist.\\" \\"Mother Simpson\\" is one of Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein's favorite episodes as they feel it is a perfect combination of real emotion, good jokes and an interesting storyWeinstein, Josh (2005). Commentary for \\"Mother Simpson\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. and they have expressed regret about not submitting it for the Emmy Award in the Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour) category. \\"My Mother the Carjacker\\" received a Writers Guild of America Award nomination in 2004 in the animation category. \\"Mona Leaves-a\\" received mixed reviews from critics. Robert Canning described it as \\"clunky and forced and wasn't all that funny\\" but still gave it a 7/10. Richard Keller called it a decent episode, but despised Mona's brief appearance.

Prior to this a number of earlier explorers had sailed the Moreton Bay area. Most notable was Matthew Flinders who spent 15 days in the general vicinity during his 1799 expedition from Port Jackson to Hervey Bay. Due to the difficulty of finding coastal rivers by seaward exploration, none of these explorers became aware of the existence of the Brisbane River.The Life of Captain Matthew Flinders, R.N. Later in 1823, when the Surveyor General, John Oxley, was commissioned by Governor Brisbane to find sites for further penal settlements, he made a trip to the Moreton Bay area. If not for a chance meeting with one of Finnegan‚Äôs surviving partners, Thomas Pamphlett, and the men telling him of a large freshwater river they had stumbled across some months earlier, Oxley may never have made the exploration that led to the establishment of Brisbane Town some years later. The 'Timbergetting' Voyage The four men, Thomas Pamphlett, Richard Parsons, John Thompson and Finnegan himself, left Sydney on 21 March 1823 bound for the ‚ÄòFive Islands‚Äô (Illawarra). They had been hired to fetch cedar wood. Shortly after they departed a fierce storm blew them out to sea and they were forced to go 21 days without water. During this time Thompson died and was buried at sea a few days later, his friends not being able to put their boat ashore. The three survivors were beached on Moreton Island on 16 April 1823 and made friends with the local Aborigines.Field's New South Wales p.89 (published 1825) Assuming themselves to be somewhere south of Jervis Bay, the explorers determined to get back to Sydney. The natives took them by boat across the passage to Stradbroke Island where they spent approximately six weeks with the Noonucal tribe before heading across to the mainland, pulling in somewhere around the Cleveland area. They then began to travel north in hope of reaching civilization. It wasn't long before the trio stumbled across a large river which they were unable to cross. They trekked upstream for almost a month, weakened due to lack of good food and hardly able to swim many of the creeks they encountered en route. Upon reaching Oxley Creek, however, they procured a canoe and attempted their first crossing of the river.Extract from account by Pamphlett Found It was later in the year when John Oxley made his entrance into Moreton Bay. An extract from his diary on 19 November 1823 describes his unexpected meeting with Pamphlett:At the time of the meeting Finnegan was away on a hunting trip and Parsons had continued north in search of Sydney, an endeavour the other two men had decided to abandon, choosing rather to return to the Bribie Island area to live with the natives. When Finnegan returned the two men related to Oxley their discovery of the large river. Oxley was determined to explore it and, taking Finnegan with them as their guide, he and Stirling set off on 1 December 1823, entering the river the following day.

He is now an Australian citizen, Separated from his wife, he has one child, Genevieve Aloka, born in 1997, and has been living in the Blue Mountains since 1994. Hammial started work at the age of twelve and had over one hundred jobs in five countries before retiring in 2000. A member of the Woodford Bush Fire Brigade between 1995 and 2003, Hammial fought many of the fires that raged through the Blue Mountains during those years. An environmental and human rights activist, he has worked as a volunteer for the Wilderness Society and for the Free Tibet Action Group. Literary and artistic career Hammial has published thirty-four collections of poetry and is the editor of \\"25 po√®tes australiens\\", an anthology published in Trois-Rivi√®res and Paris. He is also the editor with Ulli Beier and Rudi Krausmann of the seminal \\"Outsider Art in Australia\\". As at August, 2020 he has had 428 poems published in 132 journals in 17 countries. His work has appeared in 32 poetry anthologies in seven countries. As the director of The Australian Collection of Outsider Art, he has curated or helped to organise twenty-six exhibitions of Australian Outsider Art ‚Äì in Australia, Germany, France, Belgium and the United States. The most recent exhibition ‚Äì \\"Australian Outsiders\\" (23 artists) ‚Äì spent two months at the Orange Regional Gallery, seven weeks at the Hazelhurst Regional Gallery and then went to the Halle St. Pierre in Paris for six months (September 2006 to February 2007) where it was very well received. Hammial himself is also an artist. He has had thirty-four solo exhibitions and his work has been included in over seventy group exhibitions, including two in Paris. His work can be found at the Rex-Livingston Gallery in Katoomba, NSW, Australia. In 1979 he became the editor of Island Press. The oldest small press in Australia still publishing poetry, Island was founded in 1970 by Philip Roberts and has published sixty titles to date. Two of his poetry collections were short-listed for the Kenneth Slessor Prize ‚Äì \\"Bread\\" in 2001 and \\"In the Year of Our Lord Slaughter's Children\\" in 2004 and one was short- listed for the ACT Poetry Book Prize ‚Äì \\"Skin Theory\\" in 2010.

In the 1840s a wooden bridge crossed at this location. The current bridge was built in 1886 by the Wrought Iron Bridge Company of Canton, Ohio. It is a double intersection Pratt truss bridge. The construction of the nearby John Basilone Veterans Memorial Bridge replaced the Nevius Street Bridge in 2005;Raritan River over Lyman Street the bridge now serves as a pedestrian bridge, connecting River Road in Hillsborough with the Raritan River Greenway. The bridge, described using its historic name, Raritan Bridge, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 12, 1992 for its engineering and method of construction. Background Joannes Nevius was born in Zoelen, Netherlands, in 1627 and emigrated to New Amsterdam in 1651. His grandson, Petrus or Peter Nevius, was the first with the Nevius name to come to the Raritan Valley in Somerset County.

It features a staggered-column magazine, all-metal construction or optional Polyframe, and a hammer-forged floating barrel. The gun's name, RAMI, is derived from combining the first two letters of the designers' given names, Radek Hauerland and Milan Trkulja. Design The CZ 2075 RAMI field stripped. The frame, barrel, slide pin, recoil spring, and slide lock are visible. The RAMI is similar to the CZ 75, however the design has been reduced in size to create an ideal concealed carry firearm for those who find the CZ 75 or similar handguns too bulky. The RAMI is available in both 9 mm and .40 S&W; calibers. Depending on caliber, the ammunition capacity of the magazine will vary from 10+1 or 14+1 (10 in the magazine and one round in the chamber) with the 9 mm version. 7+1 or 9+1 available in the .40 S&W; version. The RAMI can be fired either double or single action. The 2075 RAMI also features full length slide grooves which minimize play in the action and increases overall accuracy. The 2075 is designed with a slide lock that holds the chamber open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. The RAMI is quickly disassembled for cleaning and maintenance. To do this the slide stop is pushed out and the slide is pulled forward off the pistol frame. This allows the action to be further dismantled separating the barrel, recoil spring, and trigger components. Further tear down (e.g. firing pin cleaning) should only be performed by a competent gunsmith.CZ 2075 RAMI owner's manual  Variants  The 2075 RAMI P (with polymer frame). The CZ 2075 RAMI is produced in two variants; an alloy frame model (meaning the \\"body\\" of the pistol below the slide is constructed of metal) or polymer. The alloy model has the advantage of increased ruggedness, customizable grips, and increased weight which helps absorb recoil. The polyframe design offers corrosion resistant polymer and lighter weight (both attributes sought by individuals who carry concealed). Both variants are available in either 9mm or .40 S&W; caliber. The 9mm version can utilize an extended magazine, increasing ammunition capacity to 14+1. The CZ 2075 RAMI will also accept all standard CZ 75 mags, including the 18 round SP-01 magazine, 19 round SP-01 magazine, and ProMag 32-round magazine. The CZ2075 RAMI Polymer Version was discontinued as of 2011.  Safety features  Most firearms, including the CZ 2075 RAMI, offer safety features which help to minimize the chance of a negligent discharge. The CZ 2075 features an inertia pin safety that prevents the firing pin from protruding through the pin hole and making contact with the back of a chambered cartridge in the event the pistol is dropped. The CZ 2075 BD model replaces the manual safety with a decocker, allowing the user to safely lower the hammer and prevent accidental firing. The decocker mechanism integrates a catch between the uncocked and fully cocked position that is designed to keep the hammer from striking the firing pin during the event the thumb should slip off the hammer prematurely during cocking. Pulling the trigger disables this safety, allowing the pistol to discharge.  Sights  The CZ 2075 RAMI comes with factory installed combat sights (sometimes referred to as \\"three-dot sights\\"). Night sights are available for the RAMI that feature tritium inserts for better visibility in low light conditions.

It came from three decisions of the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals‚ÄîIn re Freeman, 573 F.2d 1237 (C.C.P.A. 1978), In re Walter, 618 F.2d 758 (C.C.P.A. 1980); and In re Abele, 684 F.2d 902 (C.C.P.A. 1982) ‚Äîwhich attempted to comply with then-recent decisions of the Supreme Court concerning software-related patent claims. Overview The test was used to determine whether a patent claim was directed entirely to mathematical principles or algorithms, which are not patentable subject matter. The aim of the test was to allow claims that do not attempt to monopolize traditionally patent ineligible subject matter, such as mathematics, thinking, and laws of nature. Though primarily concerned with mathematical algorithms the test has some applicability in all subject matter discussions. Its use peaked in 1994 with In re Schrader. Its use then faded, to be replaced by the now also superseded \\"useful, concrete, and tangible result\\" test of In re Alappat. The current legal test for patent eligibility is stated in the Supreme Court's decisions in Bilski v. Kappos, Mayo v. Prometheus, and Alice v. CLS Bank. Development from Freeman test The Freeman test was: > First, it must be determined whether the claim directly or indirectly > recites an \\"algorithm\\" in the Benson sense of that term, for a claim which > fails even to recite an algorithm clearly cannot wholly preempt an > algorithm. Second, the claim must be further analyzed to ascertain whether > in its entirety it wholly preempts that algorithm.In re Freeman, 573 F.2d > 1237, 1245 (C.C.P.A. 1978). In Freeman the invention was a system for typesetting alphanumeric information, using a computer-based control system in conjunction with a photo-typesetter of conventional design.573 F.2d at 1238. The invention was: > ... three signal-processing steps. First, the input codes are read, and a > tree structure of symbols representing the mathematical expression is built. > Second, the signals specifying the relative concatenation point positions of > the symbols are composed by application of the local positioning algorithm. > Third, an image of the expression, with all symbols in proper position, is > generated on the CRT or other output device.573 F.2d at 1241. The court limited the term \\"algorithm\\" to mathematical algorithms or formulas. The court did not consider Freeman's step to be a formula or algorithm, and therefore reversed the PTO's claim rejections. In Walter, the invention was a system for processing seismic \\"chirp\\" signals by mathematical procedures. The PTO asked the court to reconsider the second Freeman step, which the PTO asserted conflicted with the Supreme Court's Flook case. The court stated that the second Freeman step \\"involves examination of the claim 'to ascertain whether in its entirety it wholly preempts [the] algorithm.'\\"In re Walter, 618 F.2d 758, 766 (C.C.P.A. 1980). The court said it would rephrase \\"the second step of the Freeman test in terms other than preemption.\\"618 F.2d at 767. The new version was: > If it appears that the mathematical algorithm is implemented in a specific > manner to define structural relationships between the physical elements of > the claim (in apparatus claims) or to refine or limit claim steps (in > process claims), the claim being otherwise statutory, the claim passes > muster under ¬ß 101\\\\. If, however, the mathematical algorithm is merely > presented and solved by the claimed invention, as was the case in Benson and > Flook, and is not applied in any manner to physical elements or process > steps, no amount of post-solution activity will render the claim statutory; > nor is it saved by a preamble merely reciting the field of use of the > mathematical algorithm.618 F.2d at 767. Furthermore, \\"if the end-product of a claimed invention is a pure number, as in Benson and Flook, the invention is non-statutory regardless of any post- solution activity which makes it available for use by a person or machine for other purposes.\\" On the other hand, if the product invention produces a physical thing,\\" such as a seismic trace, it could be patented. The court evaluated the claimed invention and decided that it was just a calculation and therefore patent ineligible.618 F.2d 767-68. Finally in Abele the invention was a system for processing CAT-scan signals. Once again, the court addressed and refined the second step of the analysis. The court said that the applicants appealing from the PTO's rejection had a valid point when they complained that the test set out two extreme ends of a spectrum and then failed to \\"provide a useful tool for analyzing claims in the 'gray area' which falls between the two ends of that spectrum.\\"684 F.2d at 907. Now, the court reformulated the test in these terms: > Walter should be read as requiring no more than that the algorithm be > \\"applied in any manner to physical elements or process steps,\\" provided that > its application is circumscribed by more than a field of use limitation or > non-essential post-solution activity. Thus, if the claim would be \\"otherwise > statutory,\\" albeit inoperative or less useful without the algorithm, the > claim likewise presents statutory subject matter when the algorithm is > included. This broad reading of Walter, we conclude, is in accord with the > Supreme Court decisions.684 F.2d at 907. Final Freeman-Walter-Abele test  The final version of the test has two parts. First, determining whether the claim recites an algorithm within the meaning of Benson. Second, determining whether the algorithm is \\"applied in any manner to physical elements or process steps\\" per In re Abele. Under the final version of the Freeman-Walter-Abele test, any placement of any conventional obvious apparatus in the claim seemed to be enough for the court to find the subject matter patent eligible. In one case, a ROM for storing numerical squares was sufficient.In re Iwahashi, 888 F.2d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 1989). This state of affairs was burlesqued in the mythical \\"Case of the Automated Substance Spreader,\\" a computerized system for spreading fertilizer.George Washington Computer Law. Decline  This test was largely done away with by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit with In re Alappat.In re Alappat, 33 F.3d 1526 (Fed. Cir. 1994) Now, the result became most important. If a mathematical algorithm produced a \\"useful, concrete and tangible result\\" the claim was statutory subject matter. Thus by the later 1990s in cases such as AT&T; Corp. v. Excel Communications, Inc. in 1999 and other similar cases, it became no longer to require presence of physical hardware elements. The Freeman-Walter-Abele test was repudiated in 1998 in State Street Bank, which described it as having \\"little, if any, applicability to determining the presence of statutory subject matter.\\" However, it continued to have use in the patent office, which viewed it as much the same as the \\"practical application\\" and \\"useful, concrete and tangible results\\" tests. Death It became clear in the In re Alappat case that a majority of the Federal Circuit had lost patience with the complexity of the Freeman- Walter-Abele test, but Chief Judge Nies and Judge Archer dissented from this step. The two Trovato decisions highlighted the difference in opinion.See In re Trovato, 42 F.3d 1376 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Nies, C.J.), vacated en banc, 60 F.3d 807 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The original Trovato panel decision used the Freeman-Walter-Abele test to find that Trovato's claims were ineligible \\"abstract ideas.\\" The vacatur order did not give any reason why the original opinion by Judge Nies was incorrect.For a discussion of the Trovato case, in which the conclusion is drawn that \\"the Federal Circuit's underlying message is clear: The future of software patents has arrived, and Trovato is now part of that future\\"‚Äîsee E. A. Uhl, Sent Back to the Future of Software Patents, In re Trovato, 21 U. 757 (1995). No subsequent Federal Circuit opinion was based on the Freeman-Walter-Abele test. The Federal Circuit then turned to the less complex \\"useful, concrete, and tangible result\\" test, but turned away from it in In re Bilski, which adopted a modified version of the Freeman-Walter-Abele test, known as the \\"machine-or-transformation test.\\" On appeal of In re Bilski, in Bilski v. Kappos, and then in two subsequent cases, Mayo v. Prometheus and Alice v. CLS Bank, the Supreme Court held that the machine-or- transformation test was only a \\"useful clue\\" to patent eligibility and specified a two-step patent eligibility test in which the court first had to determine whether the patent claim under analysis was directed to an abstract principle and, if so, whether the principle was implemented in an inventive rather than conventional manner, as prescribed in Flook.

Personal life and education In her childhood, Bull frequented the Newark Museum of Art in New Jersey to study. Bull next expanded her studies into painting when she attended Bennington College, headed at the time by artist Paul Freely, where she graduated with a B.A. in Music and Art in 1960. In 1969, she married painter Malcolm Morley. The marriage lasted until their divorce in 1972, yet his pieces would go on to influence her earliest works. She would then attend New York University, where she graduated in 1980 with an M.A. degree in Art and Art Education. Career Bull became known originally for her Photorealism paintings made in the mid 1970s and 80s. Among her most famous Photorealist works are Flamingo Stereopticon, Lincoln Center Reclining Figure and Winged Narcissus. This earlier work was influenced by her mentor and ex- husband, Malcolm Morley and by the Pop spirit of Photorealism. It was shown and sold through the Louis K. Meisel Gallery in New York City and has been collected widely in Kansas City through the Morgan Gallery, owned before her death by curator and gallerist Myra Morgan. During this time, Bull was one of the most noted photo-realists along with Morley. In the late 1980s, Bull‚Äôs art began to develop towards abstraction, or neo-abstract expressionism. Instead of seeking to depict the familiar, touchable surfaces of this world, Bull felt compelled to investigate and capture the teeming, yet unseen forces giving rise to those surfaces. In her break-through series of paintings The Magdalene Cycle (1992) for example, the large canvases seem to lay bare the hidden energies and biomorphic entities that animate and enliven the physical realm. Sparked by her newfound approach to painting, in the mid-1990s Bull began to explore other media. Since that time her artistic output has included performance art, sculpture, mixed media, and printmaking, as well as painting. She has been especially prolific in the area of printmaking, creating numerous bodies of work in collaboration with master printer Virgili Barbara at Taller 46, a prestigious printmaking studio in Barcelona, Spain. At the height of their careers, Picasso, T√†pies, Mir√≥ and Saura also worked in this place with the founder and father of Virgili, Joan Barbara. In 2003 Bull‚Äôs award-winning series of carborundum etchings entitled Barcelona! (2001) was exhibited at Gallerie Universitini in Plze≈à, Czech Republic. The Barcelona! etchings are surging pictures whose influences are redolent of those natural structures created by the forces of wind, water and organic process. Bull has produced many diverse series of etchings that continue to be exhibited worldwide. Bull‚Äôs most recent works on canvas, Dark Matter (2008), are relief or sculptural paintings. Bull uses the term ‚Äútopographies‚Äù to describe these works. The images in the Dark Matter series appear to be growing off the canvas, and, like her earlier abstract paintings, they appear to be covering and uncovering at once, the mysteries dwelling below the visible surfaces of this world. In 2009, Bull debuted In Flanders Fields: A Meditation on War, a series of installations based on the poem In Flanders Fields by World War I Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae. Inspired by her personal experience witnessing World War II as a child, Bull sought to emulate the poem's portrayal of the devastation of war and a hope for peace through depicting the symbols and imagery in print and sculpture. These symbols would include the flying larks, the fields of poppies, and the dead that laid among them. Exhibitions of In Flanders Fields were shown at the Carving Studio and Sculpture Center in Rutland, Vermont in 2009, the Woman Made Gallery in 2010, the Christine Price Gallery at Castleton College in 2011,the Chaffee Art Center in 2015, and the Henry Sheldon Museum in 2018. To the question: what are your influences and inspirations, Bull replies: The whole world, everything I see, read, learn, hear, all the art ever made, all the music, poetry and literature‚Äîwhat James Hillman calls the Gloria Duplex‚Äîthe glorious, amazing and paradoxical array of everything. When she is not working in Barcelona, Bull lives and works in Vermont, where in 2005 she founded Gallery in-the-Field, a fine art gallery and performance space, whose mission is to present the work of provocative, innovative living artists. Along with the production of her own art, Bull teaches in universities and art schools throughout the United States and abroad. Fran Bull is represented by Walker Fine Art in Denver, Colorado. Books In 1990, Bull collaborated with Ann Salwey on an artist's book Mordant Rhymes for Modern Times. In Barcelona in 2001, Bull co-authored an artist's book with Carolyn Corbett: Balm of Dreams = B√°lsamo de mis sue√±os. It combines Corbett's love poetry with Bull's copper plate etchings, \\"Suite Sweet.\\" References External links * http://www.franbull.com * http://www.galleryinthefield.com * http://www.walkerfineart.com * http://www.carvingstudio.org/ * http://www.designerscarvesbymarlena.com/Meet%20Fran%20Bull.html Category:American artists Category:1938 births Category:Living people ","title":"Fran Bull"},{"id":"20048432","text":"Antoine Bello (born 25 March 1970) is a French-American author born in Boston, Massachusetts, whose works have been widely translated. His novels touch on multiple subjects, such as the relation between reality and fiction, human cognition and journalism. He writes in French, his native tongue. He has been living in the greater New York Area since 2002. Work Bello's first book, Les Funambules (), a collection of short stories, was published in France in 1996. It received the Prix litt√©raire de la vocation awarded by the Fondation Bleustein-Blanchet. One of the short stories included in Les Funambules had received the Prix du jeune √©crivain de langue fran√ßaise in 1993. Since then, Bello's has published nine novels, which have been translated into a dozen languages, such as German, Russian, Greek and Japanese.

And I wonder, ‚ÄòWho are these people? Why did they do it? What an appetite for knowledge and for sharing it they must have.‚Äô And I feel blessed that people do that.\\"Mon Dieu! Why a French novelist gave an entire year's royalties to Wikipedia : https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/09/25/novelist-royalties-wikipedia/  Prior career  Prior to becoming a full-time writer, Bello co-founded the French company Ubiqus, which he sold in 2007.

The problem is as follows: The two dots at eye level are possible locations of the viewer's eye. : A painting hangs from a wall. Given the heights of the top and bottom of the painting above the viewer's eye level, how far from the wall should the viewer stand in order to maximize the angle subtended by the painting and whose vertex is at the viewer's eye? If the viewer stands too close to the wall or too far from the wall, the angle is small; somewhere in between it is as large as possible. The same approach applies to finding the optimal place from which to kick a ball in rugby.. For that matter, it is not necessary that the alignment of the picture be at right angles: we might be looking at a window of the Leaning Tower of Pisa or a realtor showing off the advantages of a sky-light in a sloping attic roof.  Solution by elementary geometry  550px There is a unique circle passing through the top and bottom of the painting and tangent to the eye-level line. By elementary geometry, if the viewer's position were to move along the circle, the angle subtended by the painting would remain constant. All positions on the eye-level line except the point of tangency are outside of the circle, and therefore the angle subtended by the painting from those points is smaller. By Euclid's Elements III.36 (alternatively the power-of-a- point theorem), the distance from the wall to the point of tangency is the geometric mean of the heights of the top and bottom of the painting. This means, in turn, that if we reflect the bottom of the picture in the line at eye-level and draw the circle with the segment between the top of the picture and this reflected point as diameter, the circle intersects the line at eye- level in the required position (by Elements II.14).  Solution by calculus  In the present day, this problem is widely known because it appears as an exercise in many first-year calculus textbooks (for example that of Stewart James Stewart, Calculus: Early Transcendentals, Fifth Edition, Brooks/Cole, 2003, page 340, exercise 58). Let : a = the height of the bottom of the painting above eye level; : b = the height of the top of the painting above eye level; : x = the viewer's distance from the wall; : Œ± = the angle of elevation of the bottom of the painting, seen from the viewer's position; : Œ≤ = the angle of elevation of the top of the painting, seen from the viewer's position. The angle we seek to maximize is Œ≤ ‚àí Œ±. The tangent of the angle increases as the angle increases; therefore it suffices to maximize : \\\\tan(\\\\beta - \\\\alpha) = \\\\frac{\\\\tan\\\\beta - \\\\tan\\\\alpha}{1 + \\\\tan\\\\beta\\\\tan\\\\alpha} = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{b}{x} - \\\\frac{a}{x}}{1 + \\\\frac{b}{x}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{a}{x}} = (b-a)\\\\frac{x}{x^2 + ab}. Since b ‚àí a is a positive constant, we only need to maximize the fraction that follows it. Differentiating, we get : {d \\\\over dx}\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{x^2 + ab}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{ab - x^2}{(x^2 + ab)^2} \\\\qquad \\\\begin{cases} {} > 0 & \\\\text{if } 0 \\\\le x < \\\\sqrt{ab\\\\,{}}, \\\\ {} = 0 & \\\\text{if } x = \\\\sqrt{ab\\\\,{}}, \\\\ {} < 0 & \\\\text{if } x > \\\\sqrt{ab\\\\,{}}. \\\\end{cases} Therefore the angle increases as x goes from 0 to and decreases as x increases from . The angle is therefore as large as possible precisely when x = , the geometric mean of a and b.  Solution by algebra  We have seen that it suffices to maximize : \\\\frac{x}{x^2 + ab}. This is equivalent to minimizing the reciprocal: : \\\\frac{x^2 + ab}{x} = x + \\\\frac{ab}{x}. Observe that this last quantity is equal to : \\\\left( \\\\sqrt{x} - \\\\sqrt\\\\frac{ab}{x}\\\\, \\\\right)^2 + 2\\\\sqrt{ab\\\\,{}}. = 2\\\\sqrt{ab\\\\,{}}. Thus we have : \\\\begin{align} x + \\\\frac{ab}{x} & = u^2 + v^2 = \\\\underbrace{\\\\left(u^2 - 2uv + v^2\\\\right)}_\\\\text{a perfect square} + 2uv \\\\ & = (u - v)^2 + 2uv = \\\\left( \\\\sqrt{x} - \\\\sqrt\\\\frac{ab}{x}\\\\, \\\\right)^2 + 2\\\\sqrt{ab\\\\,{}}. \\\\end{align} }} This is as small as possible precisely when the square is 0, and that happens when x = . Alternatively, we might cite this as an instance of the inequality between the arithmetic and geometric means.

It was screened at various film festivals in 2007 and 2008 before an American DVD release on 23 September 2008.  Plot  The film opens up with a voiceover of a woman named Saiva telling the listener that a shaman said she was cursed at birth and would bring harm to anyone she cared for. While she and a young woman named Anja are camping in a subarctic region of Siberia, in desperation, she takes one of her sled dogs and after calming it, slits its throat, foreshadowing the shaman's prophecy about her birth. She and Anja then set out to relocate their camp. On the way, they almost get caught by Soviet/Russian soldiers. Fearing the worst, Saiva ventures out with Anja into the far north to the arctic tundra, passing abandoned telephone wire trees and to the area where she believes no one would ever find them. After a long paddle north, they pitch camp on a beach, where they set up their yurt. While sleeping in the night, Saiva has a flashback to her past among the reindeer tribes, after being shunned by her own tribe. In her flashback, she encounters a man who invites her into his tribe to help with the reindeer round-up. The two fall in love with each other, and after a time he gives her a wolf claw necklace. Going back to the present, Saiva and Anja live a harsh brutal life in the tundra hunting animals for their survival. One day while hunting alone, Saiva encounters a badly wounded man nearly frozen and starved to death. After his collapse, she tries to loot him, but the man regains consciousness briefly and asks for her help. Accepting him, Saiva brings him to the yurt and cleans his wounds. Later the man claims the name of \\"Loki\\". The next day on a hunting trip with them, Loki asks what he can do for them in return for their kindness and Saiva asks him to bring a reindeer. After a failed seal hunt, Loki tells Saiva in their yurt that he was an escapee from soldiers that came to clear out the tundra, and that if they find him they will shoot him. He then shows them his portable hand-cranked radio, one of several clues that the story takes place in the last decades of the 20th century. Later, Loki tries to keep his promise by bringing them a reindeer. But as he is about to shoot one, he is detained by a couple of Soviet soldiers. Just as they are about to put him in their boat, he fights back and kills both of them. He then comes back with their looted supplies and gives them to Saiva and Anja. Over the next few months Loki and Anja fall in love with each other. Saiva tries to warn him about her secret, but Anja interrupts her and they hang out with each other more and more. Another flashback scene shows Saiva finding all of her tribe dead, except for the man that she fell in love with and a baby. She is captured by soldiers. One of the soldiers who slaughtered her village rapes her after slitting the man's throat. She finds the baby after that in one of the yurts, and one of the soldiers tells her to cooperate with her or he will skin the baby alive. Later when she and the soldiers were crossing a glacier, she used a knife to cut the rope, causing all of the soldiers to fall into a crevasse. She then heads out alone with the baby into the northland. Once again going back to the present, Anja and Loki spend more and more time together during the following months. One night when Saiva is out hunting, they have intercourse. Loki eventually fulfills his promise on killing a reindeer. As their love builds up, Loki and Anja plan on leaving to go to civilization and have a family of their own. When Anja tells this to Saiva one evening, Saiva is speechless. As tension builds up Saiva's mind gets more and more worked up with depression of her daughter's leave; even when Anja asks her to come with them she is speechless. That night Loki goes out hunting. When Anja returns to the yurt, Saiva tricks Anja into combing her hair and chokes Anja to death with her own hair, in a scene reminiscent of the opening scene. She then skins Anja's face and disguises herself with it. When Loki comes back, he has sex with Saiva, assuming that she is Anja, but he then discovers Saiva's identitity. Horrified, he flees the yurt naked into the frozen tundra. The film ends with Saiva sobbing alone in her yurt.

They formed in late 1977 and disbanded in late 1981. The \\"angular, fast and quirky punk rock\\" of the Thought Criminals \\"was a fixture in the burgeoning Sydney underground scene.\\" ‚ÄòThey Only Think Twice: Return of the Thought Criminals‚Äô , ‚ÄòI-94 Bar‚Äô web-site, from the introduction to an interview with Roger Grierson in December 2005 (accessed 5 November 2008). The band‚Äôs name was derived from the concept of ‚Äòthoughtcrimes‚Äô (unapproved thoughts) from George Orwell‚Äôs book, Nineteen Eighty-Four. The Thought Criminals exemplified the do-it-yourself punk ethos of the late 1970s, with which they combined considerable business acumen. The band members formed the Doublethink record label and agency which provided recording and live performance opportunities for other new bands. History =An inner-city punk band= The Thought Criminals were formed in late 1977 with the initial line-up of Roger Grierson (aka Jack Boots; guitar), Rique Lee Kendall (aka Matt Black; bass) and Bruce Warner (aka Kit Identity; vocals). Various drummers played in the band during this early period. The band‚Äôs first gigs were at Blondies in Bondi Junction in Sydney‚Äôs Eastern Suburbs. Inspired by the DIY ethic of the Desperate Bicycles, the Thought Criminals‚Äô first recording was the EP Hilton Bomber, with Mark Kingsmill (aka Jim Boots) on drums. The EP was the inaugural release on the band‚Äôs own Doublethink label.The Thought Criminals Official Site 'BIO Dynamic', (accessed 3 November 2008). Rique Lee Kendall left to join the Last Words and, in turn, the Last Words‚Äô drummer, Ken Doyle (aka Derik Wapillspoon), joined the Thought Criminals. With the inclusion of Stephen Philip (aka Vivi Sector) on guitar, Roger Grierson switched to bass. By the end of 1978 John Hoey (aka The General) had also joined the Thought Criminals, playing keyboards.McFarlane, Ian. The Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop (Allen & Unwin: 1999), p. 639. The Thought Criminals built up a following with performances at mainly inner-city venues. The music of the Thought Criminals, in their early recordings and live performances, has been described as a \\"jagged, frantic sound\\". Their songs often had an irreverent sense of humour, perhaps exemplified by the following extract from \\"Fun\\" (1978): \\"Don‚Äôt want no top ten hit / Don‚Äôt want no disco shit / Just wanna have fun\\". The Thought Criminals' debut album, Speed. Madness.. Flying Saucers‚Ä¶, was released in February 1980. The songs were recorded in three separate sessions spread over a period of eighteen months. The Thought Criminals' Doublethink label evolved from a record label to include agency and PR functions. Other less-established bands such as Tactics, Popular Mechanics and Sekret Sekret became incorporated within the Doublethink stable. In 1980 the band toured beyond the precincts of their usual inner-city venues, at the end of which they announced their intention to retire from live performances. In their own words: \\"The band were not enamoured of the Music Business and had made a pact that when it wasn‚Äôt fun they‚Äôd call it a day ‚Äì so when it wasn‚Äôt, they did\\". The Thought Criminals‚Äô final gig was at Chequers in inner-city Sydney on 29 August 1980. In their studio phase during the following year the Thought Criminals recorded a second album, You Only Think Twice, which \\"revealed the band expanding its scope with a more considered and diverse approach\\".McFarlane, Ian. The Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop (Allen & Unwin: 1999), p. 640. In late 1981 the band played a live show at Chequers, after which the Thought Criminals disbanded. Roger Grierson, Warren Fahey and rock journalist Stuart Coupe set up the Green record label in the early 1980s. Grierson continued to work in band and tour management, eventually attaining the position of Managing Director of PolyGram Music Publishing, and later Chairman of Festival Records. In 1982 guitarist Stephen Philip joined Do-R√©-Mi. In 1988 keyboardist John Hoey joined Died Pretty. Bruce Warner became an animator and the drummer Ken Doyle works in computing. =Occasional resurrections= In July 2005 a retrospective two-CD anthology (Chrono-logical) was released, which featured all the Thought Criminals‚Äô recordings released under the Doublethink and GREEN labels. On 4 February 2006 the band reformed for a one-off performance at the Annandale Hotel to publicise the CD.FasterLouder.com.au (accessed 5 November 2008). On the subject of reforming the Thought Criminals after 25 years Roger Grierson commented: \\"It seemed like everybody was doing it and with the release of the CD, and we put a website up to give away all the songs for free, it dragged a few people out of the woodwork\\".‚ÄòThey Only Think Twice: Return of the Thought Criminals‚Äô , ‚ÄòI-94 Bar‚Äô web-site, interview with Roger Grierson in December 2005 (accessed 5 November 2008).

Letters and dating The two main groups of letters are a set of 51 letters attributed to Diogenes of Sinope, and a set of 36 letters attributed to Crates of Thebes. None of the letters are genuine. Most of the letters of Diogenes were probably written in the 1st century BCE, whereas the letters of Crates, some of which seem to be based on the Diogenes letters, probably date from the 1st century CE.Abraham J. Malherbe, (1977), The Cynic Epistles: A Study Edition. SBL It is not known who wrote the letters, but they seem to have been written by multiple authors.Leif E. Vaage, (1990), Cynic Epistles (Selections), in Vincent L. Wimbush, Ascetic Behavior in Greco-Roman Antiquity: A Sourcebook, pages 117-118. Continuum International Written in Koine Greek, the Epistles are among the few Cynic writings which have survived from the time of the Roman empire.R. Bracht Branham, Marie-Odile Goulet-Caz√©, (2000), The Cynics: The Cynic Movement in Antiquity and its Legacy, page 15. University of California Press In addition to these letters, there are 10 epistles attributed to Anacharsis and 9 epistles attributed to Heraclitus. The letters of Anacharsis may have been written in the 3rd century BCE, whereas the Heraclitean letters probably date from the 1st century CE. Anacharsis and Heraclitus predate the Cynics, but they were both regarded by the Cynics to have anticipated Cynic ideals. There are also 35 Socratic epistles supposedly written by Socrates and his followers (Antisthenes, Aristippus, Aeschines, Xenophon, etc.), many of these letters were also written by someone with a strong affinity towards Cynic ideals, albeit with a sympathy towards Aristippus rather than Antisthenes. Other fictitious letters, such as some of those attributed to Hippocrates, could also be included among the Cynic epistles. Content The Cynic epistles deal with ethical matters rather than religious ones: their purpose is not to seek the divine, but rather to seek the ethically pure life by breaking away from social norms and conventions via ascetic practices. The content of the epistles are not especially original, but probably served as a means to propagate Cynic ideology. The letters discuss different aspects of the Cynic way of life, as part of a rigorous training (askesis). Thus instructions and explanations are given on whom (and whom not) to emulate and how different aspects of wisdom are acquired and demonstrated, mixed in with polemics directed against people who oppose these ideals. The moral anecdotes contained in the epistles are probably examples of those used by Cynic street preachers of the time. As with much Cynic thought in the time of the Roman empire, the content of the epistles show influences from Stoicism and other philosophies.

Carlos Fuentes has called it the \\"Beast of Balazote.\\" The Buried Mirror: Reflections on Spain and the New World (New York: Houghton Mifflin 1992), p. 19. The sculpture has been dated to the 6th century BCE, and has been in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain in Madrid, since 1910. Bicha de BalazoteBalazote city council Detail: head. The Bicha was found at the site of Majuelos not far from the city center. Recent excavations in the Balazote plain revealed a tomb and burial mound where this piece may have originated. Nearby, important mosaics from a Roman villa were also discovered.See J. M. Bl√°zquez; G. Lopez Monteagudo; M. L. Neira Jimenez; M. P. San Nicolas Pedraz Mosaicos romanos de Lerida y Albacete(Corpus de mosaicos de Espa√±a 8) 1989. Carved of two limestone blocks in the second half of the 6th century BCE, the statue is 93 cm long and 73 cm high. It is a chimeric synthesis of man and a bull. The body is in repose and shows good knowledge of the traits of that animal, with the forelegs bent under the chest and hind legs tucked under the belly. The tail is curved on the left thigh and ends in a tuft of hair. The head is that of a horned, bearded man with bull's ears. Details of the sculpture are similar to archaic Greek hieratic sculpture in that the hair and beard are rendered by straight grooves. The piece is not carved in entirely in the round; one corner appears to be ashlar and designed to adhere to some place, like the lions of the Mausoleum of Pozo Moro. It may have belonged to a tomb or temple. There is some possibility that it represents a god of fertility, as did the man-headed bull statues used by the Greeks to represent river gods which made the fields fertile. According to A. Garc√≠a and Bellido, the Bicha represents the Greek river god Achelous whose image on Sicilian coins it resembles. \\"This sculpture is a daughter of the Greeks, and if you will, granddaughter of the Phoenicians and great-granddaughter of Mesopotamia,\\" A.

The diplomatic relations between Egypt and Germany began in December 1957. History In December, 1953, the diplomatic relations between Egypt and Germany started the first technical cooperation projects including the projects of professional habilitation, laying studies of the crude iron and other metallic prospections. Diplomatic missions Egypt has an embassy in Berlin, as well as consulates in Frankfurt and Hamburg. Germany has an embassy in Cairo and a consulate in Alexandria. Economic Egypt ranked third among the Arab countries trading with Germany. The German exports to Egypt totalled 2.1 billion euro in 2007. Whilst exports to Germany totalled 804 million euro. The German investments in Egypt are concentrated in the fields of small and medium-scale industries, information technology, car assembling, energy and land reclamation. In July 2005, Egypt and Germany signed an agreement on encouraging and protecting investments. Tourism Egypt is one of the most important destinations for German tourists. In 2007, German visitors to Egypt numbered over one million (1,086,000), making Germans the second-largest group of tourists after the Russians. The Egyptian Government reports continuing growth of German tourists and estimates the possibility of reaching high levels of German tourists' inflow to hit 1.2 million. German airline Lufthansa is one of the oldest foreign airlines to operate flights from Europe to Egypt. The airline has said \\"These flights are serving businessmen and tourists, thus making Lufthansa a key tool boosting the bilateral economic ties between Egypt and Germany\\".

Plot Billy Breedlove (Beau Bridges) is an orderly at a Texas psychiatric hospital. He simultaneously falls under the spell of two people: a blonde waitress at a local diner named Jimmie Jean Jackson (Elizabeth Taylor) and an allegedly sociopathic hospital patient named Hammersmith (Richard Burton), who is restrained in a straitjacket within a locked cell. Hammersmith promises Billy a new life with fame and fortune if he is released from his incarceration. Billy agrees to free Hammersmith, provided that Jimmie Jean can accompany their escape. The three make their way into adventures where Hammersmith murders people and steals property as the means for elevating Billy's social and financial status. Billy becomes the owner of a topless bar, the owner of a pharmaceutical company, an oil tycoon, the financier of political campaigns and a roving ambassador-at-large for the United States. Over time, Billy comes to loathe Jimmie Jean. However, Hammersmith takes an interest in her and grants her wish that she should become a mother. Hammersmith arranges for Billy to become disabled in a water skiing accident, and then convinces him to commit suicide.

The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. History Featherstone Prison was constructed on property previously owned by the Ministry of Defence. In the early 1980 inmates of the prison were found to be making forgeries of the work of Bernard Leach. Brinsford Prison was opened on the same site, adjacent to Featherstone in 1991. In a 2001 study by the Prison Reform Trust, Featherstone Prison was revealed to have the highest number of drug-using prisoners in the UK. 34% of all inmates in the jail admitted to taking drugs. A year later it was revealed that inmates were brewing their own beer using Marmite, with fruit and vegetables also being used to make alcoholic drinks. However the governor of the day Mike Pasco stated that, while not condoning the practice, he found it preferable to the inmates smuggling hard drugs into the prison. In 2004, a report by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons stated that the drug problems at Featherstone had been \\"turned around\\", and that the prison \\"was largely calm and efficient with little bullying\\". However the report also warned that improvements had not been made without a cost, as the new emphasis on security \\"pervaded the life\\" of the prison, creating an \\"over-controlled\\" environment. In 2006 another report by the Chief Inspector criticised Featherstone Prison for its overcrowding and poor environment, \\"with poorly- managed strip searches and too many prisoners being locked in cells during the day.\\" In 2007 a government study found that Featherstone Prison had the highest percentage of inmates in the UK testing positive for opiates such as heroin. During the study, prisoners were randomly tested throughout the UK over a three-month period, and 16.7% of the inmates tested at Featherstone had been taking opiates. The prison today An adult Category C Closed Training prison, Featherstone Prison has single and double cells. The prison offers education, workshops, Physical Education, Enhanced Thinking Skills programmes, Welfare to Work programmes, a Job Club, community projects and a Listeners Scheme to its prisoners, who are required to work as directed by the Labour Board.

Plot  In the near future (2018), a prisoner named Dante (William Miller) escapes from jail after having been arrested for illegally entering Spain. Forced to kill a prison guard, he is hunted down by the prison's dog, a monstrous Rottweiler police dog that sadistic prison warden Kufard (Paul Naschy) had revived and cybernetically enhanced after a fatal injury. Believing his Spanish girlfriend Ula (Irene Montala) was sent to work as a prostitute in Puerto Angel as punishment, Dante looks for her, but is exhausted by the chase and wounded by the Rottweiler. As a result, he starts having hallucinations and being haunted by the repressed memories of his and Ula's arrest. While on the run, Dante comes across a small farm owned by a young woman named Alyah who trains a shotgun on him while being accompanied by a little girl. Holding Dante up at gunpoint she coerces him into her house. There, she asks for his identity to which he says his name is Dante. Alyah then ushers him into her bedroom where she asks if he escaped from the prison to which Dante confirms. When she further asks why is he in Kufgard's prison, Dante explains that he was on a boat from Rabat but had no papers that would have allowed him to travel from it legally. He tells her that he's not going to hurt her, that he never hurt anybody and that he just needs help while Alyah pulls a knife out of the drawer after setting the shotgun down. Alyah then cleans a wound on the back of Dante's leg. Now held at knifepoint, Dante goes on to explain that he has to get to Puerto Angel as he needs to find someone. Alyah tells Dante that when her husband comes home it will be bad for him but that she can help him and that she knows someone who can take care of him. Alyah pushes Dante onto the bed and removes her headscarf and unfastens her dress. She says to him that since he is here without papers he doesn't have much of a future. Alyan pulls off her dress explaining to Dante that if you're pretty people hide you forever from your work. She then climbs on top of him while telling him that you belong to everyone who can pay and that it changes you as you might even like it. Alyah then kisses Dante and they start to make love. When Dante protests saying that he needs her to help him she says that she does not like men and could kill him no problem. She further explains that in Puerto Angel she \\"was a puta\\" under the employ of Kufgard and that she was stoned most of the time, which is what led her to dislike men. Alyah then says that her daughter, the little girl who was with her, came into her life and she named her Esperanza (after the Spanish word for \\"hope\\") as she is her hope. Esperanza, having seen the Rottweiler, runs to tell Alyah but is told to get out. As Alyah continues to make love to Dante she tells him that one of her regular clients, Santiago, was a priest who had a weakness for her. After sleeping together they never touched each other again and so instead they prayed. While this has been going on Eperanza has seen the Rottweiler kill the farm's dogs. She goes to tell Alyah again but her warnings are once again dismissed. Alyah informs Dante that she always stays on the farm for Esperanza so she will have a place to stay and won't be like her. Esperanza locks the door to keep the Rottweiler from entering then calls for Alyah. Alyah runs into the living room and blasts the Rottweiler with shotgun. However this fails to kill it and it manages to destroy the shotgun when Dante tries to shoot it. The Rottweiler chases the trio through the house and despite Dante's efforts to distract the dog it chases down and kills Alyah when she locks Esperanza in a food storage cellar in the yard. Dantre takes the terrified girl out of the cellar but then the Rottweiler comes after them. However Dante manages to trap it in the cellar but the dog manages to escape. The two then sneak aboard the semi trailer of a truck but the dog pursues them, eventually landing on top of it. The noise attracts the attention of one of the drivers and she is killed when she goes to inspect it. Realizing the danger Esperanza is in as long as he is with her Dante flees the semi trailer with the Rottweiler in tow and the scared but safe Esperanza is found by the other driver. As he reaches Puerto Angel and can't find her at the brothel, he finally remembers that Ula got killed when Kufard let his dog loose on her, which led Dante to beat the dog to near death with a pipe, who was then turned into a cyborg. Dante kills Kufard as the Rottweiler catches up with him, and they fight to the death among the burning remains of Kufard's helicopter. The morning after, firemen find the skeletons of Dante, Ula and the Rottweiler on the beach.

The first church in Annapolis, it was founded in 1692 to serve as the parish church for the newly created Middle Neck Parish, one of the original 30 Anglican parishes in the Province of Maryland.Middleton, the Rev. Canon Arthur Pierce, Ph.D., Anglican Maryland, 1692-1792, Virginia Beach: The Donning Company, 1992, 5 63-103, History =First church, colonial era: 1704-1775= John Wollaston. Collection of the Baltimore Museum of Art. St. Anne's was founded in 1692 after the passing of the Establishment Act. The Act allowed for the construction of the State House, King William's School, and St. Anne's, though due to the limited work force and insufficient funds, all of the projects were finished much later than expected. Work on St. Anne's started out slowly. In 1699 the General Assembly specified that the dimensions of the church were to be and with a porch and a tower that would hang a bell. But due to the insufficient funds, no progress was made until 1700, when the government invested enough money to begin construction. By 1704, the church was finished, though some changes were made in the structure. It served Chapel River until 1715, when the Province of Maryland was returned to Lord Baltimore. A bell, which would call parishioners to services until it was destroyed by fire in 1858, was donated to St. Anne's by Queen Anne. Since St. Anne's was often referred to by writers of the time as a \\"barn\\" rather than a \\"proper place of worship\\", many locals asked the government for a new church in 1775. Their wish was granted, and in late 1775, the church was razed. In 1758, Benedict Swingate Calvert (c.1730-1788), the illegitimate son of Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, the third Proprietor Governor of Maryland was married to his cousin, Elizabeth Calvert, in St Anne's Church, by the Reverend John Gordon.Russell, George, p.8, The Ark and the Dove Adventurers Retrieved Jan 28 2010 Elizabeth was the daughter of Maryland Governor Captain Charles Calvert Butler. The parish also became the focus of a dual patronage scandal in 1776-68, under its 17th rector, Bennet Allen and Governor Horatio Sharpe. Allen also acquired the living at St. James Herring Bay and attempted to hire it out, contrary to Maryland law and the vestry's instructions. Allen ultimately gave up St. Anne's (but not St. James) upon securing the most lucrative parish in the Colony, All Saints Church in Frederick, Maryland, although that vestry locked him out shortly after his arrival and forced him to flee to Philadelphia and hire a curate, before returning to England during the American Revolutionary War.Ethan Allen, Historical Notices of St. Ann's Parish in Ann Arundel County, Maryland ...

Unfortunately, construction had to be cancelled since it was planned at the beginning of the Revolutionary War. The bricks and timber that were to be used to build to new church were sent to the Severn River to build a fort, and most of the work force went off to fight. During the War, St. Anne's parishioners worshiped at St. William's School, but as that began to become inadequate, a building was built on West Street as a temporary place for worship. After the War officially ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1783, the newly founded United States went into economic depression due to severe war debts and dislocation of accustomed trading patterns. This cause a further delay on the new church building's construction. Finally, in 1792, the new St. Anne's church was finished. It was much larger and more structurally secure than its predecessor. It was consecrated in 1792 by Bishop of Maryland Thomas John Claggett, the first Bishop of Maryland and a curate in the old church. On February 14, 1858, a furnace fire practically destroyed the interior of the building. Most of the original documents from the old church burned, and a new church building was requested. =Third church: 1858-present= The third and final church was built in 1858. It was designed in a Romanesque Revival style and incorporated a portion of the old tower. Most of the church was built in that year, apart from the steeple which was finished in 1866 due to the Civil War. This is St. Anne's current church building.

Chess Crusade follows the game of chess featuring animations between chess pieces, as these medieval themed characters confront each other on the chess board. As the pieces move around the board, they meet with intense animated combat moves in an effort to overpower or be trembled. Chess Crusades Chess Crusade was never released, and was re-tooled into \\"Chess Crusades\\" and released in 2010 for the iPad. History This game Chess Crusade is based on a chess board game, which is a reenactment of the Crusades. This is a series of war fought primarily in the Holy Land usually between the Roman Catholics of Western Europe and the Muslims of the Middle East. Also, it was a medieval military mission performed by the Europeans to recover the Holy land from the Muslims in the 11th ‚Äì 13th century.Myers P.V.N. The Crusades. Retrieved from http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/the-crusades.htm In order for a crusade to be ensured it had to be reinforced by the Pope first. In this case, you as a gamer are the pope and you are the official starter of the crusade/game. As an official starter, you can also pick which opposition you want to support, the Catholics or the Muslims. However, each side accompanies a different monarch. King Charles leads the catholic side and Saladin leads the Muslim side. These kings are alongside their queens, who are probably their spouse. To further enhance their army, the king is attended with knights, rooks, and bishops, who are the king's loyal henchmen. Finally, for the king's defence, the pawns are asserted in a form of the king's soldiers. Gameplay This game is a reenactment of the Crusades that occurred centuries ago but Slam Games did not emphasized on the history behind the war. They took the basic idea of the war and gave the game pieces a role of a medieval figure. Although, there is no medieval rivalry, there is an old school competitiveness of good vs. evil.Bailey, R.

These cartoon-style medieval armies appear evil due to the role of the pieces accommodating the armies.

Retrieved from http://www.metacritic.com/game/wii/chess-crusade This game is played just like the original game of chess with the same rules but there is one little twist to this game.

NZ Performance Car issue 13 in October 1997 featured a Shelby GT350, a car more at home on the cover of NZ Performance Car's sister publication NZV8. NZ Performance Car is a monthly automobile magazine and website, and is the biggest selling automotive and men's lifestyle magazine in New Zealand. NZ Performance Car issue 100. As Parkside Media's second title, it has eclipsed the success of NZ Classic Car. NZ Performance Car has evolved with the times, promoting the import drag racing scene, building the drifting scene and supporting modified car events such as Auto Salon and dB Drag Racing. Issue 1 of the magazine was bundled free with NZ Classic Car issue 66 (June 1996), and featured a Series 4 Mazda RX-7 on the cover. Change in focus The magazine's focus has evolved from initially covering all high performance cars, including Australian V8s, to Japanese import cars, and more recently import car culture and associated activities (BMX, FMX, interviews with local and international musicians, etc.). Early issues featured cars such as Holden Toranas alongside Mitsubishi Galant VR4s. =Typical cars featured in NZ Performance Car= *Nissan Skyline GT-R *Nissan Silvia *Nissan Pulsar GTI-R *Nissan 300ZX *Nissan 350Z *Nissan Laurel *Subaru WRX *Subaru Legacy *Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution *Honda Integra *Honda Civic *Honda S2000 *Toyota Celica *Toyota Supra *Toyota Levin AE86 *Toyota Altezza *Mazda RX-7 *Mazda 323 *Mitsubishi Galant VR4 *Toyota Hilux *Mazda GTX Magazine contents =Modified car features= The extent that a car is required to be modified has steadily increased since the first issues. While 300 hp was considered to be a huge amount of power when the magazine started, 300 kW may not even secure a spot as a feature car, unless the rest of the car is outstanding or unusual. This is not to say that NZ Performance Car solely focuses on power, but power figures are part of a more holistic approach considered when modifying a car. =New car features= Less common are new car road tests. Recent examples have included the Mazda RX-8, Mini Cooper John Cooper Works (JCW), and BMW 135i. =Cover girls= Female nudity in association with the magazine has polarised readers. The magazine took an online poll at the end of 2008, the results of which found that more than 80% of readers wanted to keep the cover girl. Cars were originally graded using a Jane-o-meter (a picture of Jane with a ranking from one to ten). This method was scrapped after car owners became reluctant to have their cars featured in case it received a low mark. =Poster= Two posters (a double-sided A2) have been included in most issues of the magazine since issue 80. =Event coverage= Drag racing, drifting, rallying, Super Lap, Japanese Super GT, hillclimbing, touring cars, auto salon, auto shows and club events are covered, as long as the racing includes Japanese cars. =Driver and celebrity interviews= Local and international drivers have been interviewed such as Ken Block, Rhys Millen, Mike Whiddett, S√©bastien Loeb, Linkin Park/Fort Minor and Nathalie Kelly (from Fast n Furious Tokyo Drift), =Regular sections= Readers' letters, a technical question and answer section, equipment information, CD/DVD/game reviews, and a lifestyle section with clothing and related culture. =Chop shop= A monthly Photoshop competition is run. An image of a standard car is modified in Photoshop to adopt a certain theme or style, such as hakosuka, rally, etc. In issue 144 readers were invited to Photoshop a Chevrolet Volt into a Pro Import drag racing vehicle. Growth Readership peaked at 336,000 in 2007. To address the fall in readership since then NZ Performance Car was relaunched with perfect binding, a new logo, and a broader focus on the import car culture in issue 132, December 2007 Notable contributors Karl Burnett, Ewen Gilmour Special issues =Drop!

Description The cap is broad, obtuse to convex, becomes flat or uplifted in age, has a smooth surface, is slimy when moist, and yellowish. The flesh is white, thick, and soft. The gills are pale gray and gradually darkens to purplish-gray or purplish-black. The gills occasionally pull away from the stipe with age. The stipe is long and is stuffed or hollow. The veil is soft and white. The spore print is dark purplish to nearly black. The species fruits in the spring and fall. It does not have a volva. =Edibility= The species has been said to taste like old leaves. Because of conflicting reports that they received on the edibility of this species, the authors Orson K.

The authors of Poisonous plants of California said that the species is suspected of being poisonous. Distribution and habitat Stropharia ambigua appears in late fall as a solitary to scattered mushroom or in groups on rich humus, usually under conifers. It can also be found with alder and other hardwoods in the Pacific Coast. It has frequently been found in disturbed areas, such as where wood was handled. The species will colonize outdoor mushroom beds after wood chips have been decomposed by a primary saprotroph. It favors a cold and damp environment.

It was so named because all three conspirators shared the same first name. Events In 1780 Antonio Berney was a Frenchman living in Santiago where he worked as a teacher of Latin and Mathematics. He was a constant reader of the Encyclop√©die, and inspired by the Enlightenment ideals he formulated a plan to establish Chile as an independent republic. He converted Antonio Gramusset, another Frenchman living in Chile to his ideas, and he in turn enlisted the aid of one of Chile's most prominent citizens, Jos√© Antonio de Rojas. The idea of the three revolutionaries was to set up a republican government based on an inclusive electoral process. Social classes were to be eliminated and slavery abolished, according to a plan that actually anticipated nineteenth-century socialism. An ambitious program of agrarian reform was included in their plans, along with a broad policy of free trade with the world at large. Nearly a decade before the French Revolution, the three Antonios conjured up one of the most democratic conspiracies in the Spanish Empire. =Discovery and trial= During a trip to a nearby town Gramusset lost his valise which contained detailed plans of their conspiracy. The valise was actually found and returned to the local policemen () who, because they could not read were unable to identify the owner, forwarded it to their headquarters in Santiago. Once the documents were in the hands of the authorities they quickly lead to the discovery of the plotters who were secretly arrested at night during new year's on January 1, 1781. Berney and Gramusset were rapidly shipped to Peru to be tried in the viceregal courts, while Rojas, because of his high social standing in Chile managed to avoid prison for a while. The Frenchmen were treated with utmost courtesy and after a year of imprisonment in Lima were shipped to Spain to be tried there. The San Pedro de Alcantara that was carrying them sank off the coast of Portugal during a storm, and Berney drowned while Gramusset managed to survive only to die three months later as a consequence of the exposure. Meanwhile Rojas, after a short exile in Spain, returned to Chile. He was arrested again in 1809 under suspicions of plotting to bring down the government but this time without any proof. His arrest hastened the downfall of the Royal Governor Francisco Garcia Carrasco who ordered the arrest and was one of the detonants of the Chilean independence movement.

The cause of the war was the desire of the U.S. government to obtain ownership of the Black Hills. Gold had been discovered in the Black Hills, settlers began to encroach onto Native American lands, and the Sioux and Cheyenne refused to cede ownership to the U.S. Traditionally, the United States military and historians place the Lakota at the center of the story, especially given their numbers, but some Native Americans believe the Cheyenne were the primary target of the U.S. campaign. Among the many battles and skirmishes of the war was the Battle of the Little Bighorn, often known as Custer's Last Stand, the most storied of the many encounters between the U.S. army and mounted Plains Indians. That Indian victory notwithstanding, the U.S. leveraged national resources to force the Indians to surrender, primarily by attacking and destroying their encampments and property. The Great Sioux War took place under the presidencies of Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes. The Agreement of 1877 (, enacted February 28, 1877) officially annexed Sioux land and permanently established Indian reservations. Background The Cheyenne had migrated west to the Black Hills and Powder River Country before the Lakota and introduced them to horse culture about 1730. By the late 18th century, the growing Lakota tribe had begun expanding its territory west of the Missouri River. They pushed out the Kiowa and formed alliances with the Cheyenne and Arapaho to gain control of the rich buffalo hunting grounds of the northern Great Plains. The Black Hills, located in present-day western South Dakota, became an important source to the Lakota for lodge poles, plant resources and small game. They are considered sacred to the Lakota culture. A map of the Great Sioux Reservation as established in 1868. \\"Unceded lands\\" for Cheyenne and Sioux use were west of the reservation in Montana and Wyoming. The desire of the U.S. government to obtain the Black Hills was the principal cause of the Great Sioux War. By the early 19th century, the Northern Cheyenne became the first to wage tribal- level warfare. Because European Americans used many different names for the Cheyenne, the military may not have realized their unity. The US Army destroyed seven Cheyenne camps before 1876 and three more that year, more than any other tribes suffered in this period. From 1860 on, the Cheyenne were a major force in warfare on the Plains. \\"No other group on the plains achieved such centralized tribal organization and authority.\\" The Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, signed with the US by Lakota and Northern Cheyenne leaders following Red Cloud's War, set aside a portion of the Lakota territory as the Great Sioux Reservation. This comprised the western one-half of South Dakota, including the Black Hills region for their exclusive use.George Hyde, Red Cloud's Folk: A History of the Oglala Sioux Indians (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1937) It also provided for a large \\"unceded territory\\" in Wyoming and Montana, the Powder River Country, as Cheyenne and Lakota hunting grounds. On both the reservation and the unceded territory, white men were forbidden to trespass, except for officials of the U.S. government.\\"Treaty with the Sioux ‚Äî Brul√©, Oglala, Miniconjou, Yanktonai, Hunkpapa, Blackfeet, Cuthead, Two Kettle, Sans Arcs, and Santee ‚Äî and Arapaho, 1868\\" (Treaty of Fort Laramie, 1868). , Apr. 29, 1868.

Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1904, pp. 998‚Äì1007. Through Oklahoma State University Library, Electronic Publishing Center... The growing number of miners and settlers encroaching in the Dakota Territory, however, rapidly nullified the protections. The US government could not keep settlers out. By 1872, territorial officials were considering harvesting the rich timber resources of the Black Hills, to be floated down the Cheyenne River to the Missouri, where new plains settlements needed lumber. The geographic uplift area suggested the potential for mineral resources. When a commission approached the Red Cloud Agency about the possibility of the Lakota's signing away the Black Hills, Colonel John E. Smith noted that this was \\"the only portion [of their reservation] worth anything to them\\". He concluded that \\"nothing short of their annihilation will get it from them\\".Smith to Gen. Ord, June 27, 1873, Department of the Platte, Letters Received, National Archives. Colonel (brevet Brigadier General) Smith was commander of the 14th Infantry, headquartered at Fort Laramie, who had extensive experience with the Lakota. In 1874, the government dispatched the Custer Expedition to examine the Black Hills. The Lakota were alarmed at his expedition. Before Custer's column had returned to Fort Abraham Lincoln, news of their discovery of gold was telegraphed nationally.Donald Jackson, Custer's Gold: The United States Cavalry Expedition of 1874 (New Haven, 1966). Ernest Grafe and Paul Horsted, Exploring with Custer: The 1874 Black Hills Expedition (Golden Valley Press, 2002). The presence of valuable mineral resources was confirmed the following year by the Newton‚ÄìJenney Geological Expedition.H. Newton, W. P. Jenney, et al., Report on the Geology & Resources of the Black Hills of Dakota (Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1880). Prospectors, motivated by the economic panic of 1873, began to trickle into the Black Hills in violation of the Fort Laramie Treaty. This trickle turned into a flood as thousands of miners invaded the Hills before the gold rush was over. Organized groups came from states as far away as New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Initially, the United States Army struggled to keep miners out of the region. In December 1874, for example, a group of miners led by John Gordon from Sioux City, Iowa, managed to evade Army patrols and reached the Black Hills, where they spent three months before the Army ejected them. Such evictions, however, increased political pressure on the Grant Administration to secure the Black Hills from the Lakota. Sitting Bull, a Hunkpapa, was one of the principal Sioux leaders. In May 1875, Sioux delegations headed by Spotted Tail, Red Cloud, and Lone Horn traveled to Washington, D.C. in an eleventh-hour attempt to persuade President Ulysses S. Grant to honor existing treaties and stem the flow of miners into their territories. They met with Grant, Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano, and Commissioner of Indian Affairs Edward Smith. The US leaders said that the Congress wanted to pay the tribes $25,000 for the land and have them relocate to Indian Territory (in present-day Oklahoma). The delegates refused to sign a new treaty with these stipulations. Spotted Tail said, \\"You speak of another country, but it is not my country; it does not concern me, and I want nothing to do with it. I was not born there ... If it is such a good country, you ought to send the white men now in our country there and let us alone.\\"Griske, pp. 64‚Äì69 Although the chiefs were unsuccessful in finding a peaceful solution, they did not join Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull in the warfare that followed. Later that year, a US commission was sent to each of the Indian agencies to hold councils with the Lakota. They hoped to gain the people's approval and thereby bring pressure on the Lakota leaders to sign a new treaty. The government's attempt to secure the Black Hills failed.James C. Olson, Red Cloud and the Sioux Problem (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1968). While the Black Hills were at the center of the growing crisis, Lakota resentment was growing over expanding US interests in other portions of Lakota territory. For instance, the government proposed that the route of the Northern Pacific Railroad would cross through the last of the great buffalo hunting grounds.M. John Lubetkin, Jay Cooke's Gamble: The Northern Pacific Railroad, the Sioux, and the Panic of 1873 (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2006). In addition, the US Army had carried out several devastating attacks on Cheyenne camps before 1876. Combatants Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer was killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn along with 268 soldiers. The number of Indian combatants in the war is disputed with estimates ranging from 900 up to 4,000 warriors.Ambrose, Stephen E. Crazy Horse and Custer New York: Anchor Books, 1996, p. 415 The seven bands of the Lakota Sioux in the 1870s numbered perhaps 15,000 men, women, and children, but most of them were living on the Great Sioux Reservation and were noncombatants. An Indian agent in November 1875 said the Indians living in the unceded areas numbered \\"a few hundred warriors.\\"Textor, Lucy E. Official Relations between the United States and the Sioux Indians, Palo Alto: Stanford University Press, 1896, p. 120 General Crook estimated that he might face up to 2,000 warriors.Hatch, Thom The Custer Companion Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 2002, p. 218. Most of the Sioux who remained in the unceded territory where the war would take place were Oglala and Hunkpapa, numbering about 5,500 in total.Bray, Kingsley, \\"Teton Sioux: Population History, 1655‚Äì1881\\" Nebraska History, Summer 1994, p. 175 Added to this were about 1,500 Northern Cheyenne and Arapaho for a total hostile Indian population of about 7,000, which might include as many as 2,000 warriors. The number of warriors participating in the Battle of the Little Bighorn is estimated at between 900 and 2,000.\\"By the Numbers: Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument\\" http://www.nationalparkstraveler.com/2011/06/numbers-little-bighorn- battlefield-national-monument8258, accessed 3 Feb 2013 The Indians had advantages in mobility and knowledge of the country, but all Indians were part-time warriors. In spring, they were partially immobilized by the weakness of their horses which had survived the long winter on limited forage. Much of summer and fall they spent hunting buffalo to feed their families. About one half of the Indian warriors were armed with guns, ranging from repeating rifles to antiquated muskets, and one half with bows and arrows.Grinnell, George Bird. The Fighting Cheyennes Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1915, 1955, p. 302 The short, stout Indian bow was designed to be used from horseback and was deadly at short range, but nearly worthless against a distant or well-fortified enemy. Ammunition was in short supply. Indian warriors had traditionally fought for individual prestige, rather than strategic objectives, although Crazy Horse seems to have instilled in the Sioux some sense of collective endeavor. The Cheyenne were the most centralized and best organized of the Plains Indians. The Sioux and Cheyenne were also at war with their long-time enemies, the Crow and Shoshone, which drained off many of their resources.Ambrose, pp. 155, 296, 412 To combat the Sioux the U.S. army had a string of forts ringing the Great Sioux Reservation and unceded territory. The largest force arrayed against the Indians at one time was in summer 1876 and consisted of 2,500 soldiers deployed in the unceded territory and accompanied by hundreds of Indian scouts and civilians.\\"Map 17\\" Atlas of the Sioux Wars http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/atlas_of_the_sioux_wars-2006-pt2.pdf, accessed 3 Feb 2013 Many of the soldiers were recent immigrants and inexperienced on the frontier and in Indian warfare.Barnard, Sandy, Digging into Custer's Last Stand.

Grant and his administration began to consider alternatives to the failed diplomatic venture. In early November 1875, Major General Philip Sheridan, commander of the Division of the Missouri, and Brigadier General George Crook, commander of the Department of the Platte, were called to Washington, D.C. to meet with Grant and several members of his cabinet to discuss the Black Hills issue. They agreed that the Army should stop evicting trespassers from the reservation, thus opening the way for the Black Hills Gold Rush. In addition, they discussed initiating military action against the bands of Lakota and Northern Cheyenne who had refused to come to the Indian agencies for council. Indian Inspector Erwin C. Watkins supported this option. \\"The true policy in my judgement,\\" he wrote, \\"is to send troops against them in the winter, the sooner the better, and whip them into subjection.\\"John S. Gray, Centennial Campaign: The Sioux War of 1876 (Fort Collins, CO: The Old Army Press, 1976) pp. 23‚Äì29. Concerned about launching a war against the Lakota without provocation, the government instructed Indian agents in the region to notify all Lakota and Sioux to return to the reservation by January 31, 1876, or face potential military action. The US agent at Standing Rock Agency expressed concern that this was insufficient time for the Lakota to respond, as deep winter restricted travel. His request to extend the deadline was denied. General Sheridan considered the notification exercise a waste of time. \\"The matter of notifying the Indians to come in is perhaps well to put on paper,\\" he commented, \\"but it will in all probability be regarded as a good joke by the Indians.\\"Sheridan endorsement, February 4, 1876, National Archives. Meanwhile, in the council lodges of the non-treaty bands, Lakota leaders seriously discussed the notification for return. Short Bull, a member of the Soreback Band of the Oglala, later recalled that many of the bands had gathered on the Tongue River. \\"About one hundred men went out from the agency to coax the hostiles to come in under pretense that the trouble about the Black Hills was to be settled,\\" he said. \\"...All the hostiles agreed that since it was late [in the season] and they had to shoot for tipis [i.e., hunt buffalo] they would come in to the agency the following spring.\\"Grant Short Bull Interview, July 13, 1930, in Eleanor H. Hinman (ed.) \\"Oglala Sources on the Life of Crazy Horse\\", Nebraska History v. 57 no. 1 (Spring 1976) p. 34. As the deadline of January 31 passed, the new Commissioner of Indian Affairs, John Q. Smith, wrote that \\"without the receipt of any news of Sitting Bull's submission, I see no reason why, in the discretion of the Hon. the Secretary of War, military operations against him should not commence at once.\\" His superior, Secretary of the Interior Zachariah Chandler agreed, adding that \\"the said Indians are hereby turned over to the War Department for such action on the part of the Army as you may deem proper under the circumstances.\\" On February 8, 1876, General Sheridan telegraphed Generals Crook and Terry, ordering them to commence their winter campaigns against the \\"hostiles\\", thus starting The Great Sioux War of 1876‚Äì77.Commissioner of Indian Affairs to Secretary of the Interior, January 31, 1876; Secretary of the Interior to the Secretary of War, February 1, 1876; Colonel Drum to Gen. Terry and Gen. Crook, February 8, 1876, National Archives Reynolds' campaign While General Terry stalled, General Crook immediately launched the first strike. He dispatched Colonel Joseph J. Reynolds with six companies of cavalry, who located a village of about 65 lodges and attacked on the morning of March 17, 1876. Crook accompanied the column but did not play any command role. His troops initially took control of and burned the village, but they quickly retreated under enemy fire. The US troops left several soldiers on the battlefield, an action which led to Colonel Reynolds' court martial. The US captured the band's pony herd, but the following day, the Lakota recovered many of their horses in a raid. At the time, the Army believed they had attacked Crazy Horse; however, it had actually been a village of Northern Cheyenne (led by Old Bear, Two Moons and White Bull) with a few Oglala (led by He Dog.)J. W. Vaughn, The Reynolds Campaign on Powder River (Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 1961). Summer expeditions The three columns of the 1876 summer campaign In the late spring of 1876 a second, much larger campaign was launched. From Fort Abraham Lincoln marched the Dakota Column, commanded by General Alfred Terry, with 15 companies or about 570 men, including Custer and all 12 companies of the Seventh Cavalry. The Montana Column, commanded by Colonel John Gibbon, departed Fort Ellis.Donovan, p. 97 General Crook commanded a third column that departed Fort Fetterman to head north. The plan was for all three columns to converge simultaneously on the Lakota hunting grounds and pin down the Indians between the approaching troops. =Battle of the Rosebud= General Crook's column was the first to make contact with the northern bands in the Battle of the Rosebud on June 17. While Crook claimed a victory, most historians note that the Indians had effectively checked his advance. Thus the Battle of the Rosebud was at the very least a tactical draw if not a victory for the Indians. Afterward General Crook remained in camp for several weeks awaiting reinforcements, essentially taking his column out of the fighting for a significant period of time. =Battle of the Little Bighorn= Custer and the last of his men were killed and buried here. The Indian village was on the other side of the line of trees marking the Little Bighorn River. To visit the old battlefield today it is necessary to enter the Crow Indian Reservation ‚Äì it was exactly the same in 1876. Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer and the Seventh Cavalry were ordered out from the main Dakota Column to scout the Rosebud and Big Horn river valleys. On June 25, 1876, they encountered a large village on the west bank of the Little Bighorn. The US troops were seriously beaten in the Battle of the Little Bighorn and nearly 270 men were killed, including Custer. Custer split his forces just prior to the battle and his immediate command of five cavalry companies was annihilated without any survivors. Two days later, a combined force consisting of Colonel Gibbon's column, along with Terry's headquarters staff and the Dakota Column infantry, reached the area and rescued the US survivors of the Reno-Benteen fight. Gibbon then headed his forces to the east, chasing trails but unable to engage the Sioux and Cheyenne warriors in battle. =Battle of Slim Buttes= Reinforced with the Fifth Cavalry, General Crook took to the field. Hooking up briefly with General Terry, he soon moved out on his own but did not find a large village. Running short on supplies, his column turned south and made what became called the Horsemeat March toward mining settlements to find food. On September 9, 1876, an advance company from his column en route to Deadwood to procure supplies stumbled across a small village at Slim Buttes, which they attacked and looted. Crazy Horse learned of the assault on the village and the next day led a counter-attack, which was repulsed. After reaching Camp Robinson, Crook's forces disbanded. Crackdown at the agencies In the wake of Custer's defeat at the Little Bighorn, the Army altered its tactics. They increased troop levels at the Indian agencies. That fall, they attached most of the troops to the Army for operations. They seized horses and weapons belonging to friendly bands at the agencies, for fear they would be given to the resisting northern bands. In October 1876, Army troops surrounded the villages of Red Cloud and Red Leaf. They arrested and briefly confined the leaders, holding them responsible for failing to turn in individuals arriving in camp from hostile bands. The US sent another commission to the agencies. According to historian Colin Calloway, \\"Congress passed a law extinguishing all Lakota rights outside the Great Sioux Reservation.\\" Mackenzie's campaign Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie and his Fourth Cavalry were transferred to the Department of the Platte following the defeat at the Little Bighorn. Stationed initially at Camp Robinson, they formed the core of the Powder River Expedition that departed in October 1876 to locate the northern villages. On November 25, 1876, his column discovered and defeated a village of Northern Cheyenne in the Dull Knife Fight in Wyoming Territory. With their lodges and supplies destroyed and their horses confiscated, the Northern Cheyenne soon surrendered. They hoped to be allowed to remain with the Sioux in the north. They were pressured to relocate to the reservation of the Southern Cheyenne in Indian Territory. After a difficult council, they agreed to go. When they arrived at the reservation in present-day Oklahoma, conditions were very difficult: inadequate rations, no buffalo left alive near the reservation, and malaria. A portion of the Northern Cheyenne, led by Little Wolf and Dull Knife, attempted to return to the north in the fall of 1877 in the Northern Cheyenne Exodus. They succeeded in reaching the north. After they divided into two bands, that led by Dull Knife was captured and imprisoned in an unheated barracks at Fort Robinson without food or water. When the Cheyenne escaped on January 9, 1878, many died at US Army hands in the subsequent Fort Robinson massacre. Eventually the US government granted the Northern Cheyenne a northern reservation, the Northern Cheyenne Reservation in present-day southern Montana.Chapter 14, \\"Cheyenne Exodus\\", pp. 331‚Äì59, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West, Dee Brown, Henry Holt (1970, Owl paperback edition 1991), trade paperback, 488 pages, Chapter 29, \\"Little Wolf and Dull Knife, 1876‚Äì79\\", pp. 398‚Äì413 and Chapter 30, \\"The Fort Robinson Outbreak\\", pp. 414‚Äì27, The Fighting Cheyennes, George Bird Grinnell, University of Oklahoma Press (1956, Scribner's Sons 1915), hardcover, 454 pagesIn Dull Knife's Wake: The True Story of the Northern Cheyenne Exodus of 1878 by Maddux Albert Glenn, Horse Creek Publications (October 20, 2003), trade paperback, Miles' campaigns Another strategy of the US Army was to place troops deep within the heartland of Lakota Territory. In the fall of 1876, Colonel Nelson A. Miles and his Fifth Infantry established Cantonment on Tongue River (later renamed Fort Keogh) from which he operated throughout the winter of 1876‚Äì77 against any hostiles he could find. In January 1877, he fought Crazy Horse and many other bands at the Battle of Wolf Mountain. In the months that followed, his troops fought the Lakota at Clear Creek, Spring Creek and Ash Creek. Miles' continuous campaigning pushed a number of the Northern Cheyenne and Lakota to either surrender or slip across the border into Canada. Miles later commanded the US Army during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Annexation The Agreement of 1877 (, enacted February 28, 1877) officially took away Sioux land and permanently established Indian reservations. Diplomatic efforts An Indian warrior, painting by Frederic Remington While military leaders began planning a spring campaign against the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne who had refused to come in, a number of diplomatic efforts were underway in an effort to end the war. =\\"Sell or Starve\\"= After the defeat at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in June 1876, Congress responded by attaching what the Sioux call the \\"sell or starve\\" rider () to the Indian Appropriations Act of 1876 (enacted August 15, 1876) which cut off all rations for the Sioux until they terminated hostilities and ceded the Black Hills to the United States.House Report 95-375United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians (Ct. Cl. 1979), 601 F.2d 1157, 1161 =George Sword mission= As the winter wore on, rumors reached Camp Robinson that the northern bands were interested in surrendering. The commanding officer sent out a peace delegation. About 30 young men, mostly Oglala and Northern Cheyenne, departed from the Red Cloud Agency on January 16, 1877 to make the dangerous journey north. Among the most prominent members of this delegation was a young Oglala named Enemy Bait (better known later as George Sword). He was the son of the prominent headman Brave Bear. The delegation found Crazy Horse on the Powder River, but found no indication that he was prepared to surrender. Other Oglala camps nearby, however, were more willing to hear the message and to seriously consider surrendering at the agencies. In late February, part of the delegation continued on to find the Northern Cheyenne, where they delivered the same message. =Spotted Tail mission= The influential Brul√© headman Spotted Tail also agreed to lead a peace delegation out to meet with the \\"hostiles\\". Departing his agency on February 12, 1877 with perhaps 200 people, Spotted Tail moved north along the eastern edge of the Black Hills. They soon found a large village of Miniconjou under Touch the Clouds, near Short Pine Hills on the Little Missouri River. After several days of councils, they agreed to go in and surrender at the Spotted Tail Agency. Spotted Tail's delegation continued on to the Little Powder River, where they met with Miniconjou, Sans Arc, Oglala and a few Northern Cheyenne, including leaders such as Black Shield, Fast Bull, Lame Deer, and Roman Nose. Most of these bands also agreed to go in to the Spotted Tail Agency to surrender. Crazy Horse was not in the camp, but his father gave a horse to a member of the delegation, as evidence that the Oglala war leader was ready to surrender. =Johnny Brughier mission= Not to be outdone by General Crook's diplomatic efforts, Colonel Miles sent out a peace initiative from his Tongue River Cantonment. Scout Johnny Brughier, aided by two captive Cheyenne women, found the Northern Cheyenne village on the Little Bighorn. They met in councils for several days. His effort would lead to a large contingent of Northern Cheyenne eventually surrendering at the Tongue River Cantonment. =Red Cloud mission= On April 13, a second delegation departed the Red Cloud Agency, led by the noted Oglala leader Red Cloud, with nearly 70 other members of various bands. This delegation met Crazy Horse's people en route to the agency to surrender and accompanied them most of the way in. Surrenders The continuous military campaigns and the intensive diplomatic efforts finally began to yield results in the early spring of 1877 as large numbers of northern bands began to surrender. In April 1877, an aide of General Crook's wrote to a friend: \\"I am now fully satisfied that the great Sioux War is now ended and that we will have once more a chance to have peace.\\" A large number of Northern Cheyenne, led by Dull Knife and Standing Elk, surrendered at the Red Cloud Agency on April 21, 1877. They were shipped to Indian Territory the following month. Touch the Clouds and Roman Nose arrived with bands at the Spotted Tail Agency. Crazy Horse surrendered with his band at Red Cloud on May 5. =Death of Crazy Horse= The respected Oglala leader Crazy Horse spent several months with his band at the Red Cloud Agency amidst an environment of intense politics. Fearing he was about to break away, the Army moved to surround his village and arrest the leader on September 4, 1877. Crazy Horse slipped away to the Spotted Tail Agency. The following day, Crazy Horse was brought back to Camp Robinson with the promise that he could meet with the post commander. Instead, he was taken to the guard house under arrest. During his struggle to escape, he was fatally bayoneted by a soldier. Flight to Canada While many of the Lakota surrendered at the various agencies along the Missouri River or in northwestern Nebraska, Sitting Bull led a large contingent across the international border into Canada. General Terry was part of a delegation sent to negotiate with the bands, hoping to persuade them to surrender and return to the US, but they refused. Not until the buffalo were seriously depleted, and troubles began to surface with other native tribes in Canada, did they finally return. In 1880‚Äì81, most of the Lakota from Canada surrendered at Fort Keogh and Fort Buford. US forces transferred them by steamboat to the Standing Rock Agency 1881.  Aftermath  The Great Sioux War of 1876‚Äì77 contrasted sharply with Red Cloud's War fought a decade earlier. During the 1860s, Lakota leaders enjoyed wide support from their bands for the fighting. By contrast, in 1876‚Äì77, nearly two-thirds of all Lakota had settled at Indian agencies to accept rations and gain subsistence. Such bands did not support or participate in the fighting. The deep political divisions within the Lakota continued well into the early reservation period, affecting native politics for several decades. In 1889‚Äì90, the rise of the Ghost Dance movement found a large majority of its followers among the non- agency bands who had fought in the Great Sioux War. While much more numerous in total population, the bands of the Lakota generally were independent and made separate decisions about warfare. Many bands did ally with the Cheyenne, and there was intermarriage between the tribes. An alternative view is that the Plains Indians considered the war of 1876‚Äì77 to be \\"The Great Cheyenne War\\".

History  The Rembrandt Club of Pomona College in Claremont, California was established in 1905 for the promotion and encouragement of the arts. It predates all of the major art museums of Southern California. and remains active today.Rembrandt Club of Pomona College In 1907, Arabella Huntington, whose Southern California home is now the Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, purchased Rembrandt's Aristotle Contemplating a Bust of Homer (1653) for her house in Paris. After her death the painting was inherited by her son Archer M. Huntington. He sold it in 1928, the year that the Huntington Library, Art Gallery, and Botanical Gardens was established. Aristotle was eventually purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York in 1962, for 2.3 million dollars. At the time this was the highest amount ever paid for a painting at a public or private sale.\\"$532,000 Is Paid at Sotheby's For Rembrandt's 'Bartholomew,'\\" New York Times, June 28, 1962. In 1913, the Los Angeles County Museum of History, Science, and Art opened in Exposition Park. The inclusion of the three divisions had been determined in part by the Smithsonian's configuration, and there was very little art to display. Indeed, in order to meet the deadline of the formal dedication ceremonies on November 6, 1913, the fine arts wing was not only hung with loans from Southern California collectors, but also with a number of works borrowed from East Coast owners.Higgins, Winifred Haines, \\"Art Collecting in the Los Angeles Area: 1910-1960,\\" doctoral dissertation, University of California, Los Angeles, 1963, pp. 7-10. The galleries were organized by \\"Living Artists\\" and \\"Old and Deceased Artists\\" The opening of the museum was timed to coincide with the completion of the Owens Valley aqueduct--it was part of the celebratory festivities. This was no coincidence: the ready availability of water made the development of Southern California possible. Soon a community interested and knowledgeable regarding culture and fine arts emerged. In the 20th century, collections of art that included paintings by old masters such as Rembrandt were highly sought after by many of America's business elite, and Southern-California collectors were no exception. Considered a newsworthy event, accounts in the Los Angeles Times trumpet the earliest arrivals of professed Rembrandt paintings in the Southland in 1928 and 1932.\\"Rembrandt Acquired by Angelenos,\\" Los Angeles Times, September 18, 1928, p. A1 and \\"Angelenos Buy Rembrandt,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 11, 1932, p. A1. An Elderly Jew in Fur Cap (1645) was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. Fred E. Keeler of Hollywood in 1928. President and major stockholder of the Lockheed Corporation, Keeler informed the press that he and his wife hoped to build a gallery to house their pictures adjoining their home, and open it to the public.Keeler's statement inspired Los Angeles Times arts editor Arthur Miller to proclaim \\"their pictures have proved such a source of pleasure to the collectors that they wish to share it with others. This is a beautiful idea. What could be more conducive to the appreciation of paintings than the existence of several small galleries throughout the city, thrown open to the public, so that people in various neighborhoods might come in contact with works of art? Let us hope they do build their gallery and that others are moved by example to follow a similar course.\\" Arthur Miller, \\"Rembrandt Caps Collection,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 2, 1928. During the fall and winter of 1934-35, the Los Angeles Sunday Times published a series entitled \\"Southern California's One Hundred Finest Privately Owned Paintings.\\" The Keeler's \\"Rembrandt\\" was featured in the first edition of the series. When Mary Keeler died in 1939, she left their collection of art to the County Museum of History, Science, and Art, without restrictions. Another purported Rembrandt, Portrait of a Woman with Oriental Headdress (1635), was acquired by Mr. and Mrs. Willitts J. Hole of Hancock Park in 1932. An early twentieth century Southern California real estate developer, Hole built a private art gallery adjoining his residence, in which the collection was arranged by nationality and lit by artificial light, akin to a museum. In 1938, the Willitts J. Hole collection was donated by his daughter Agnes Hole Rindge to the University of California, Los Angeles.\\"University Gets Art Gift: Hole Collection to Be Permanent Display at U.C.L.A. Campus,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 17, 1938 and \\"Hole Art Collection Removed to U.C.L.A.,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 23, 1939. The UCLA Art Gallery's curator denounced the collection and strongly objected to the gift, and as a result was forced to resign from his position. Higgins, Winifred Haines, \\"Art Collecting in the Los Angeles Area: 1910-1960,\\" doctoral dissertation, University of California, Los Angeles, 1963, pp. 242. Soon after, on January 8, 1940, the Hole Rembrandt and many other paintings from the collection were installed in the UCLA Library. Supported by scholars as genuine works by Rembrandt's hand at the time, both the Keeler and Hole pictures have since been reconsidered. German art historian Wilhelm Valentiner published Rembrandt Paintings in America in 1931, with the inclusion of just one work in California: St. John the Baptist (1632), owned by newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst of Los Angeles.No. 14 in Wilhelm R. Valentiner, Rembrandt Paintings in America. (New York: S.W. Frankel, 1931). The Portrait of a Woman with Oriental Headdress, 1635, is no. 52 in this publication; predating its heralded debut in California, it was still in a gallery in New York at the time. In 1947 when the picture was owned by Marion Davies, Hearst gave the funds to Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) to purchase it, along with eighteen other works, from her. No longer considered by Rembrandt, it is presently attributed to Govert Flinck and called Portrait of a Bearded Man. Already a well known art world figure, Wilhelm Valentiner came to Los Angeles in 1946 to assume the directorship of the precursor of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), the \\"Los Angeles County Museum.\\" As described above, prior to a division in 1961, fine art was integrated with history and science in what is now the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County's edifice. In 1947, shortly after arriving in Los Angeles, Valentiner organized and curated a major loan exhibition of works by Rembrandt and fellow Dutch seventeenth-century painter Frans Hals at the County Museum. The show featured paintings from a number of Southern California private collections such as Jacob M. Heimann of Los Angeles, J. Paul Getty of Los Angeles, Mr. and Mrs. Converse M. Converse of Santa Barbara, and George Huntington Hartford II of Los Angeles; and included works that are in Southern California museums today, namely the Los Angeles County Museum's Portrait of Marten Looten and the Hammer Museum's Juno. Getty gave Marten Looten to the Los Angeles County Museum in 1953, undoubtedly convinced to do so by Valentiner. Soon after the Rembrandt expert became the first director of the newly created J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, 1954. Shortly after the new Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) had opened in 1961, critic Howard Taubman penned an article in the New York Times entitled \\"Culture Way Out West: Los Angeles Art Museum Embarks on Long Road to First-Class Status\\" suggesting that there was a good deal of room for improvement. \\"Museum leaders have calculated the cost of upgrading various areas of their collection,\\" he states, \\"To achieve a No. 1 spot in Thai art...would cost only $250,000. To approach the heights of a Rembrandt repository...would cost no less than $65 million.\\" The article also reports a rumor about a Southern California Rembrandt that is very illuminating: While Los Angeles may resent signs of Eastern condescension, it has not lost its sense of humor. It is still capable of chuckling about a story, possibly only a rumor, involving a Rembrandt portrait owned by Howard Ahmanson, banker and patron of the arts. Some doubt has been cast on the authenticity of the painting's attribution, and the plan, the story has it, has been worked out for a test. There is a similar Rembrandt at the National Gallery, and the one here will be carried tenderly in the next month or two to Washington, where the two paintings will be hung and studied side by side. Wouldn't it be funny, remarked a cynical fellow the other day, if some expert opined that the one in Washington is dubious? Are you laughing back there in the East?Howard Taubman, \\"Culture Way Out West: Los Angeles Art Museum Embarks on Long Road to First- Class Status\\" New York Times, November 8, 1966. Rembrandt, Saint Bartholomew, 1661, was sold in 1962 at a Sotheby's, London standing-room only sale. Purchased by J. Paul Getty, it is now in collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum. In 1965, Norton Simon, a Southern California businessman and major Los Angeles County Museum of Art supporter, purchased Rembrandt's Titus at a Christie's London auction. The result was a media commotion. The painting had been knocked down by the auctioneer to an English buyer, but Simon was able to reopen the bidding by producing a letter that proved that the auctioneer had overlooked his prearranged bidding signal.Gene Sherman, \\"Freeze Ends; LA will get Rembrandt's 'Titus,'\\" Los Angeles Times, May 12, 1965. A natural genius at promotion and marketing, Simon arranged the Rembrandt portrait's American debut at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, where its debarkation from the plane was filmed for posterity. Stating that \\"the painting has such great beauty and universal appeal that the Norton Simon Foundation has a special obligation to exhibit it in the most favorable circumstances for the widest possible enjoyment,\\" Simon allowed the work to be on view there for six months, where it was seen by over 300,000 visitors.\\"East will see 'Titus' before it comes here,\\" Los Angeles Times, May 13, 1965. That June, Simon and the Rembrandt picture made the cover of Time Magazine.Time, June 4, 1965 Disguised as a wrapped Christmas present and featuring a tag reading \\"To Mother,\\" Titus made the plane trip from DC to Southern California in December 1965 Grace Glueck, \\"A Bottle is a Bottle,\\" New York Times, December 19, 1965. In 2008 the Hammer Museum, the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Norton Simon Museum, and the Timken Museum of Art collaborated on an intramural exhibition of Rembrandt paintings; they called it Rembrandt in Southern California.Rembrandt in Southern California, 2008 References Further reading *Getty, Jean Paul.

Early life and education Abbot was born in Philadelphia. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Pennsylvania in 1881 before studying medicine there, graduating in 1884 and subsequently doing postgraduate studies in England, obtaining licentiates from the Royal College of Physicians and Royal College of Surgeons.

This vessel should not be confused with the other vessels, some of similar design, also named North Star. Construction The North Star was built at Wenatchee, Washington in 1902 by George Cotterell for the Columbia & Okanogan Steamboat Company, which Captain Alexander Griggs (1828-1903) was the principal owner.Newell, Gordon R., ed., H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, at 4, 80, 81, 83, 97, 140, 256-57, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1966 Operations Okanogan circa 1910 North Star operated out of Wenatchee on the Columbia and Okanogan rivers. On September 3, 1902, North Star was wrecked in Entiat Rapids. The company was able to salvage the vessel. In 1907 at Wenatchee, North Star was rebuilt and enlarged by the veteran shipwright Alexander Watson. (Another source states that the vessel was sold to H.S. DePuy & Will Lake and renamed Enterprise, and a new vessel, also called North Star was built in 1907. A third source states the vessel was rebuilt.) Withdrawn from service Steamboats at the Okanogan wharf, May 1909. While these vessels are in active service, in six years almost all steamboat activity on the Columbia River above Wenatchee will have ceased. Settlement in the Okanogan region decreased starting in about 1910.Mills, Randall V., Stern-Wheelers up Columbia, at 91-94, 198, University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln NE 1947 (1977 printing) As a result, business declined so much that by 1915, the Columbia & Okanogan Steamboat Co. was forced to take all of its boats out of service. The company had made arrangements to sell North Star to Captain Fred McDermott, who was considering taking the vessel further up the Columbia, to run between Pateros and Bridgeport. Destruction by fire The sale of North Star had not been finalized when on July 8, 1915, fire broke out on North Star when she was rafted up at Wenatchee with the rest of the company's remaining boats, the Columbia, Okanogan, and Chelan. North Star was the outermost vessel, but the fire soon spread to the other three. All the vessels were rapidly and completely destroyed, and although the hull of the innermost vessel, Chelan remained afloat, the damage to that vessel was beyond repair. There was no insurance. The Columbia & Okanogan Steamboat Co. had so little money that they were planning to use some of the proceeds of the anticipated sale of North Star to pay the insurance premiums on the remaining three vessels. The cause of the fire was never determined.Timmen, Fritz, Blow for the Landing -- A Hundred Years of Steam Navigation on the Waters of the West, at 74-76, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, ID 1973 Notes Further reading * Faber, Jim, Steamer's Wake -- Voyaging down the old marine highways of Puget Sound, British Columbia, and the Columbia River, Enetai Press, Seattle, WA 1985 See also Steamboats of the Columbia River, Wenatchee Reach Category:Steamboats of Washington (state) Category:Steamboats of the Columbia River ","title":"North Star (sternwheeler 1902)"},{"id":"20049717","text":"was a member of the Supreme Court of Japan.

It is made with mutton and vegetables (tomatoes, potatoes, chickpeas), infused with saffron water to add flavour and colour, all covered by a lump of fat, and cooked in a sealed crock. Piti is served in the crock, usually accompanied by an additional plate for \\"disassembling\\" the meat and the liquid part with vegetables, which may be eaten separately as the first (soup with vegs) and second (meat) course meal. Piti is particularly popular in Iran, where it is mostly called abgoosht or dizi. Tasty, flavourful and nourishing piti is traditionally cooked in earthenware pots called chanag, kyupe or dopu. There are so many variations from the Balkans, Moldova, Georgia and Mediterranean countries that the name is more an idea of a recipe, rather than a named stew or soup. The etymology of the name is derived from the Turkic word bitdi, which means the end of need to eat any more food. The secret to a good piti is long, slow cooking. It is usually served in two courses: the clear soup, served with flatbread (lavash) and then the solid ingredients.  Ingredients  Azerbaijan The main ingredients of Azerbaijani piti are mutton, tail fat, chickpeas, potato, onions, dried alycha (cherry plum) and saffron. Meat is gradually simmered with already soaked chickpeas in piti-pots. Potatoes, onions, alycha and saffron infusion are added 30 before the meal is ready. Sumac powder is also served separately. In Azerbaijan, piti is eaten in two steps. First, bread is crumpled in the additional plate and sprinkled with a purple mix of spices. Then, the broth is poured over it and the resulting mixture is consumed as a hearty soup. Second, more crumpled bread is added to the same plate and the remainder of the Piti (the lump of mutton fat, the meat and the vegetables) is poured over, sprinkled with the same spices, mixed together so as to break down the fat and then eaten. Piti is cooked in different ways in Azerbaijan, especially Shaki region is renowned with its specific piti. = Shaki piti = right Shaki piti is specific because boiled chestnuts are used instead of potato. It is cooked in an earthenware pot called \\"dopu\\", which should not be a new one. Firstly, chickpeas are placed in the ceramic pots, then small pieces of mutton are added. The top layer is salted tail fat. After all of this, water is poured to the pot. Piti is cooked in 8‚Äì9 hours.

The Indian diplomatic mission in Abidjan was opened in 1979. Ivory Coast opened its resident mission in New Delhi in September 2004. Both nations are currently fostering efforts to increase trade, investments and economic cooperation.  Commercial and economic relations  According to the Indian ambassador to ivory coast, India plans to invest $1 billion into developing oil and mining projects over the next five years. In the last ten years, the total amount of announced Indian FDI abroad has been more than $10 billion. From India's energy security viewpoint, Ivory Coast has emerged as an important destination for investment opportunities in hydrocarbon exploration and diamonds. Recent BBC reports have drawn attention to the emerging importance of Africa in India's foreign economic policy and the special role that West Africa is now occupying. India hopes to tap into the region's vast oil wealth by accessing the Gulf of Guinea's shoreline. Oil production in Ivory Coast stands at more than 60,000 barrels per day. India's ONGC has already invested $12m to explore an offshore block in the region, that it is now drilling. India is also facilitating the development of an IT-cum- Technology Park in Abidjan, named after Mahatma Gandhi. India's Minister of State for Commerce, Jairam Ramesh, has said both countries are also cooperating in new areas such as pharmaceuticals, transport, water supply and telecommunications. Addressing the second Indo-Ivory Coast Joint Trade Commission, the Indian Commerce Minister stated that India wanted to establish a \\"strategic partnership\\" with Ivory Coast to develop diamond mining, cutting and polishing, which would offer employment to the local population. India's Tata Steel and SODEMI (Ivorian state-owned company for mineral development) have entered into a joint venture agreement (JVA) for the development of Mount Nimba Iron ore deposits in Ivory Coast (West Africa). The Mt Nimba deposit, spread over 3 countries - Liberia, Guinea and Ivory Coast, is one of the biggest in the Africa. With Ivory Coast still maintaining its status as the economic powerhouse of French West Africa, India is looking to open new factories in the country. Ivory Coast's Minister of Mines, Energy and Petroleum, Monnet Leon, has also urged India to make use of Ivory Coast's vast mineral resources, including bauxite, limestone, iron ore, manganese, nickel, gold and diamonds which have not been significantly explored. Ivory Coast's business community has proclaimed that India, being the world's largest democracy, can help Ivorians cement democracy in their country and bring in stabilisation through economic process. India has also been one of the largest troop contributors to the UN peace-keeping mission in the Ivory Coast. India‚Äôs new economic diplomacy in Africa In a bid to expand its economic reach, India launched an initiative in 2004 called Techno-Economic Approach for Africa‚ÄìIndia Movement (TEAM‚Äì9), together with eight energy- and resource- rich West African countries, including Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mali, Guinea- Bissau, Ghana, and Burkina Faso. According to the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, the initiative was part of a broader policy to engage the underdeveloped, yet resource-wealthy countries of West Africa, which required both low-cost technology and investment to develop their infrastructure. In particular, India increasingly wants to play an important role in helping Ivory Coast and other West African countries channel their energy resources more efficiently. Ambassador Shamma Jain also states that there is also a growing demand for courses run by ITEC and SCAAP on information technology, rural credit, small- and medium-scale industries, women's entrepreneurship and quality control, which is creating a ‚Äòconstituency of interest‚Äô in India. In August 2006, Ivorian Foreign Minister Youssouf Bakayoko led a 110-member delegation, comprising top Ivorian entrepreneurs and government ministers, to the Indo-Ivorian trade commission meeting in New Delhi, where they drafted dozens of agreements to be signed later in the year. In January 2009, Ivory Coast conferred its highest award upon the Indian Minister of State for External Affairs Anand Sharma. India's Deputy Foreign Minister Sharma accompanied by Ambassador Shamma Jain and a high-level delegation discussed an entire gamut of issues during his visit to Ivory Coast with President Laurent Gbagbo that included the UN reforms, expansion of the UN Security Council and reshaping of the global financial infrastructure. Ivory Coast expressed its vociferous condemnation of the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the forces behind it and reiterated its solidarity with India in its combat against terror. President Gbagbo reaffirmed his government's appreciation of India's leadership role, its economic strength, and above all, its willingness to share its expertise, technology and development experience with African countries. Against this backdrop, in a gesture that underlined the special ties with India, President Laurent Gbagbo conferred the Commander of the National Order, the country's highest civilian award in recognition of the Indian Foreign Minister's distinct role in strengthening India's relationship with Ivory Coast and the African continent.

She was one of the Democratic primary candidates for the position of Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii in the 2018 election. Iwamoto previously served as a commissioner on the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission and was previously elected to serve two terms on the Hawaii Board of Education. She was recognized as a Champion of Change by President Barack Obama in 2013, and in 2018 Newsweek listed her as one of fifty need-to-know pioneers for LGBTQ rights.  Early life and career  Iwamoto is Japanese-American and was born on the island of Kauai. Iwamoto's mother went into labor at a private party hosted by Grace Guslander to celebrate the expansion of her Coco Palms Resort, and Iwamoto was then born the next day. Guslander visited Iwamoto's mother in the hospital with a bouquet of flowers, a card, and a request to name Iwamoto ‚ÄúCoco‚Äù after her internationally award-winning hotel. = Education = Iwamoto attended Kaimukƒ´ Community Christian Pre-School on O ªahu, H≈çk≈´lani Elementary School, Ali ªi≈çlani Elementary School, and Hanahau ªoli Elementary School. Iwamoto later attended and graduated from St. Louis High School. She received an Associate of Arts in Merchandising from the Fashion Institute of Technology, a Bachelor of Arts in Creative Writing from San Francisco State University, and her Juris Doctor from the University of New Mexico School of Law. In 2011, Iwamoto completed Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government program for Senior Executives in State and Local Government as a David Bohnett LGBTQ Victory Institute Leadership Fellow. = Family and personal life = Her paternal great-grandparents left Japan to work in the sugar cane plantations of Kaua ªi. Iwamoto's paternal grandmother met her paternal grandfather at Tip-Top Restaurant on Kauai, where she was working as a cashier. The two used their family cars to start a taxi company, which eventually expanded to a tour company and a rental-car company. Iwamoto's father began working for the family business in high school as a car washer, and their collective efforts became known as Roberts Hawaii. Iwamoto's maternal grandparents left Japan to grow cantaloupe and other produce in Imperial Valley, California. During World War II, Iwamoto's mother and her family were forced into internment camps in Poston, Arizona. Iwamoto's uncles were released from the internment camp to enlist in the military to serve the United States of America. Eventually the entire family was released and they returned to their farm. When Iwamoto's mother was in high school, she contributed to the family business by taking care of all the bookkeeping. = A passion for advocacy = Shortly after finishing her undergraduate degree, Iwamoto moved back to New York City where she had attended FIT. It was here that she became more aware of social injustice. Using her own life experience as a transgender woman, Iwamoto spent time volunteering at a local community center, helping youth develop leadership skills. It was here that her passions for helping houseless youth and LGBTQ houseless youth were fostered. Helping youth like the ones she worked with in New York was part of her motivation for attending law school. When Iwamoto returned to Hawaii she became a licensed therapeutic foster parent. = Public service and business experience = Iwamoto recently served as a commissioner on the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission, appointed by Governor Neil Abercrombie to serve the four-year term from 2012 to 2016. She also previously served two terms with the Hawaii Board of Education, Oahu-at-Large from 2006 to 2011.

This squared map features a graduated scale of 100 li for each rectangular grid. China's coastline and river systems are clearly defined and precisely pinpointed on the map. On the reverse side of the engraving is another map, Huayi tu. Chinese cartography began in the 5th century BC during the Warring States period when cartographers started to make maps of the Earth's surface. Its scope extended beyond China's borders with the expansion of the Chinese Empire under the Han dynasty. By the 11th century during the Song dynasty highly- accurate maps drawn on grids were produced. During the 15th century, the Ming dynasty admiral Zheng He went on a series of voyages to the South China Sea, Indian Ocean, and beyond and maps for areas outside of China were produced, although world maps covering territories known to the Chinese outside of China existed as early as the Tang dynasty.  Legends of maps  There is an ancient Chinese legend called He Bo Xian Tu (), which roughly means \\"the River Deity presenting a map\\". During the mythical Xia dynasty, a river deity gave Yu the Great a stone with a flood map etched on its surface. Yu the Great used the map to help him in taming the flood that threatened to destroy rural agriculture. In general, the development of early Chinese cartography experienced three phrases: primitive map, classical map, and survey map. The primitive maps were simple maps, still steeped in myth and legend. It was not until the Han dynasty that classical maps began to emerge.  Earliest reference to maps in historical texts  The earliest reference to a map in Chinese history can be found in Volume 86 of the historical text Records of the Grand Historian (Shi Ji). This volume recorded an incident in 227 BC during the late Warring States period in which a map is mentioned. Crown Prince Dan of the Yan state sent Jing Ke to assassinate the King of the Qin state, so as to prevent Qin from conquering Yan. Jing Ke pretended to be an emissary from Yan, and said he wanted to present the King of Qin with a map of Dukang, a fertile region in Yan which would be ceded to Qin in exchange for peace between the two states. The map, which was rolled up and held in a case, had a poison-coated dagger hidden in it.Needham, Volume 3, 534. As Jing Ke was showing the King the map, he slowly unrolled the map until the dagger was revealed, and then seized it and tried to stab the King. The King managed to escape unharmed and Jing Ke was killed in his failed assassination attempt. From then on, maps are frequently mentioned in Chinese historical texts.Needham, Volume 3, 535.  Qin dynasty maps  Fragment of the paper map from Fangmatan Tomb 5 In 1986, seven maps were found in Tomb 1, dating to the Qin state of the Warring States period, at Fangmatan in Gansu Province. The maps were drawn in black ink on four rectangular pieces of pine wood, 26.7 cm in length and between 15 and 18.1 cm in width, and depict the tributary river systems of the Jialing River in Sichuan Province. The areas covered by the seven maps overlap, but in total they cover 107 √ó 68 km in area. In addition to the seven maps on wooden blocks found at Tomb 1 of Fangmatan, a fragment of a paper map (5.6 √ó 2.6 cm) was found on the chest of the occupant of Tomb 5 of Fangmatan in 1986. This tomb is dated to the early Western Han dynasty, so the map dates to the early 2nd century BC. The map shows topographic features such as mountains, waterways and roads, and is believed to cover the Qin state of the Warring States period.  Han dynasty maps  Silk map from Mawangdui, dating back to circa 168 BC. Concrete evidence of the existence of maps in ancient China dates back to the Han dynasty (206 BC ‚Äì 220 AD). The three silk maps found at the Mawangdui tumulus in Changsha, Hunan Province are traced back to the 2nd century BC. The three maps are a topographic map of the Changsha region, a military map of southern Changsha, and a prefecture map. Research on the three maps indicates that the Chinese had acquired cartography skills in the Han dynasty. Although the military map does not contain names, a legend, scales, or any form of explanatory text, it shows modern Hunan, Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, as well as the boundary between the Han Empire and Nanyue Kingdom, covering the area from 111¬∞E to 112¬∞30‚Ä≤E, and from 23¬∞N to 26¬∞N. The scale of the map is approximately 1:180000. At the time of their discovery, these three silk maps were the oldest to be found in China. However, they were superseded in 1986 after Qin dynasty maps dating back to the 4th century BC were found in Fangmatan, Tianshui, Gansu Province. After the Han dynasty, Pei Xiu of the Jin dynasty helped improve Chinese cartography by making use of the grid previously introduced by Zhang Heng. Pei Xiu became known as the 'father of scientific cartography in China'. Tang and Song dynasty maps Copy of the Huayi tu, a 12th century map of China. Included in the map is the Great Wall of China and it covers all the territories of China with a few foreign states on the edge. During the Tang dynasty Jia Dan improved the knowledge of China on foreign countries. He wrote a number of works on geography that described foreign states and trade routes, as well as producing a map Hainei Huayi Tu (, \\"Map of Chinese and non-Chinese Territories in the World\\"). The map includes China and other known countries and was presented to the emperor in 801. The map was 9.1 m (30 ft) in length and 10 m (33 ft) in height, mapped out on a grid scale of one inch equaling one hundred li (Chinese unit of measuring distance).Needham, Volume 3, 543 The Hainei Huayi Tu map is lost, but a later map of China from the Southern Sung period, the Huayi tu map engraved in 1136 on a stele, contains names of foreign places inscribed on the edges that it took the names from Jia Dan's map. On the reverse side of Huayi tu is the gridded Yu Ji Tu (Map of the Tracks of Yu the Great). This map is the earliest surviving example of lattice cartographic grid found in Chinese map, a system first introduced in earlier dynasties. The stele with the maps is now in the Stele Forest or Beilin Museum () in Xi'an, China.  Yuan and Ming dynasty maps  Throughout the Yuan (1271‚Äì1368) and Ming (1368‚Äì1644) dynasties, Chinese cartography did not experience any significant developments. However, traditional cartography skills became more refined, and different types of maps starting appearing. The new types of maps include national maps showing mountains and cities, land defence maps, coastal defence maps, river maps for flood control, and nautical charts for maritime navigation. These maps exhibited characteristics such as greater focus on the accuracy of rivers and mountains, greater use of mathematics in cartography, and the use of administrative divisions to demarcate boundaries. In 1579, Luo Hongxian published the Guang Yu Tu () atlas, which includes more than 40 maps, a grid system, and a systematic way of representing major geographical features such as mountains, rivers, roads and borders. The Guang Yu Tu incorporates the discoveries of admiral Zheng He's 15th century voyages along the coasts of China, Southeast Asia, India, and East Africa. Among Ming dynasty maps, Zheng He's map, also known as Mao Kun map, was the most influential nautical chart. Between 1405 and 1433, the Ming government sponsored Zheng He to go on a series of seven naval expeditions to places in the South China Sea, Indian Ocean, and beyond. Thus, Zheng He's map was the important in the history of Chinese cartography and a specific one for maritime navigation. It also exhibited some special characteristics in terms of how its contents are presented: * For map readers' convenience, the map is continuously splicing from the starting point of Zheng He's voyages to the ending point. * Geographical features were drawn based on the map reader's orientation, such that map readers can find their position in the shortest time possible. * Landmarks used in maps for maritime navigation, such as reefs, ports and islands, are included. Chinese traditional cartography skills became more developed and advanced in the late Ming dynasty under the influence of new ideas of technology and studies of natural science, which were introduced from the West to China. The Da Ming Hun Yi Tu, dating from about 1390, is in multicolour. The horizontal scale is 1:820000 and the vertical scale is 1:1060000. The Great Ming Amalgamated Map or Da Ming Hun Yi Tu (; Manchu: dai ming gurun-i uherilehe nirugan) is a world map created in China. It was painted in colour on stiff silk and 386 x 456 cm in size.(Wang et al. 1994:51) The original text was written in Classical Chinese, but Manchu labels were later superimposed on them. It is one of the oldest surviving world maps from East Asia although the exact date of creation remains unknown. It depicts the general form of the Old World, placing China in the center and stretching northward to Mongolia, southward to Java, eastward to central Japan, and westward to Africa and Europe. The Earth's curvature affects even the scale of the Chinese section of the map. The horizontal scale is 1:820000 while the vertical scale is 1:1,060,000.(Wang et al. 1994:51-52) The use of colour is particularly effective within China itself, including elegant touches like the ochre tint of the Yellow River. The Selden Map of China, which dates from the early 17th century and shows a series of precisely plotted maritime routes, has provoked a reassessment of the global significance of Ming cartography.  Qing dynasty survey maps  The Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1912) realised that Chinese maps were not accurate enough and required scientific methods for mapping, so he sponsored a national wide geodesy and mapping programme based on astronomical observation and triangulation measurements. The map, which is called Huang Yu Quan Lan Tu (also known as the Jesuit Atlas), took over 10 years to complete from 1708. It was also the first on-the-spot survey map. It had 41 framings based on provincial boundaries and has the following characteristics: * Use of pseudo- cylindrical projection and latitude and longitude cartography methods * Simultaneous of the Chinese and Manchu languages. Boundaries were defined in Manchu, while inland contents were defined in Chinese. * Inclusion of a survey map of Taiwan for the first time Apart from cartography, the unification of scale measurement and the field measurement of meridian of earth contributed to the development of cartography in the Qing dynasty and helped to significantly improve the quality of maps.

Route description  The route began on the east side of Bowsman at PR 266 and ended at PR 268, eleven miles east of the village. Six miles east of Bowsman it intersected PR 366. The route's main purpose was to provide a connection from Bowsman to rural areas east of the village, and eventually to the Lenswood Highway. The route's most important feature was a ford crossing over the Swan River. However in 2006 it was removed due to environmental issueshttp://www.acee- ceaa.gc.ca/052/details-eng.cfm?pid=2143 and the fact that it would wash out nearly every spring. Because of this, the road is no longer a direct route to PR 268, and large detours must be made via Lenswood or PR 366 to access areas on the east side of the Swan River.  History  The route is no longer signed as PR 587 ultimately because of the ford crossing decommissioning described above. The portion from Bowsman to Craigsford is now a part of PR 366, which turns south at Craigsford and connects with PTH 10 near Minitonas. This part of the route continues to be heavily used.

He was a professor of art history at the University of California, Los Angeles for three decades, until his death. Early life Albert Isaac Boime was born on March 17, 1933, in St. Louis, Missouri. His mother, Dorothy Rubin, was a European Jewish immigrant and his father, Max Boime, was a salesman, and a naval yard worker in Brooklyn during World War II. In 1955, Boime joined the United States Army, stationing in Germany. Boime went on to earn a bachelor's degree in art history from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1961 after completing service. He followed up in the field with a master's and a doctorate from Columbia University in 1963 and 1968 respectively. During his studies, he was greatly influenced by his brother Jerome Boime (1934-1977), then in Chicago. Through his brother, he met and married Myra Block, a teacher and socialist activist in 1964. He was a professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook from 1968 until 1972. He then taught and chaired the art department at the Binghamton University, remaining there until 1978. He joined the faculty of UCLA in 1979.Fox, Margalit. \\"Albert Boime, Leading Art Historian, Dies at 75\\", The New York Times, November 1, 2008. Accessed November 2, 2008. Writings Boime wrote more than 20 books of art history, focusing not only on style and form, but using a and psychoanalytic examination of the social and political contexts of art, examining how artworks are representations of the class, economic, power and social structures and racial attitudes that exist during their creation. His first book, The Academy and French Painting in the Nineteenth Century, published in 1971 by Phaidon Press, examined the unintended role of the conservative Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts in the development of 19th-century painters. In 1974, art critic and commentator Hilton Kramer of The New York Times called the book \\"the indispensable text\\" for a reconsideration of the merits of the Salon painters, as the book demonstrated the web of connections in the cultural and institutions of the time that affected artistic tastes and aspirations of that time.Kramer, Hilton. \\"Finding a Lost Chapter of Art History-19th Century French Salon Painting; Arts\\", The New York Times, June 23, 1974. Accessed November 3, 2008. His book series, The Social History of Modern Art, analyzed French art from the mid-18th century to the end of the 19th century, making connections between the art and subject matter to historical events at the time, such as the French Revolution and the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte. The four-volume, 3,000-page series, published over a two-decade period by the University of Chicago Press, includes Art in an Age of Revolution, 1750‚Äì1800 (1987); Art in an Age of Bonapartism, 1800‚Äì1815 (1990); Art in an Age of Counterrevolution, 1815‚Äì1848 (2004); and Art in an Age of Civil Struggle, 1848‚Äì1871 (2007). =The Starry Night painting= In an analysis of Vincent van Gogh's The Starry Night, Boime convinced art historians that the images in the painting's night sky were not a fanciful artwork, but are the result of Van Gogh's observations of the sky from the window of the asylum in Saint-R√©my-de-Provence at 4 a.m. on June 19, 1889, the day he wrote his brother that he had completed the painting. In a 1985 lecture to the American Astronomical Society, Boime compared the positions of the moon and Venus that night and showed that they corresponded to the positions of the celestial objects in the painting, noting that the scene \\"tallies with astronomical facts at the time the painting was executed.\\"Rourke, Mary. \\"Albert Boime dies at 75; leading art historian taught at UCLA for 30 years\\", Los Angeles Times, October 23, 2008.

Boime examined the complex of psychological, social, and political issues that some artists face in today's society. =The Birth of Abstract Romanticism: Art for the New Humanity: Rumi and the Paintings of Kamran Khavarani= In his last publication, Boime details his encounter with the artist, Kamran Khavarani, and his paintings. The book goes through the life of Kamran Khavarani: his inspiration from the Persian poet Rumi, his painting methods, and discusses the new type of art that Khavarani has created which he calls ‚ÄúAbstract Romanticism.‚Äù In a letter from 2008, Boime writes: > After 40 years of teaching and writing numerous art history books and > articles, it is my last book \\"The Birth of Abstract Romanticism\\" that has > truly been the culmination of my career.

The men were caught in a severe storm and driven north 728 km seeing their boat smashed at the northern end of Moreton Island off the coast of Brisbane. He was probably the first Euoropean to both live in the area and discover the Brisbane River. Prior to this a number of earlier explorers had sailed the Moreton Bay area. Most notable was Matthew Flinders who spent 15 days in the general vicinity during his 1799 expedition from Port Jackson to Hervey Bay. Due to the difficulty of finding coastal rivers by seaward exploration, none of these explorers became aware of the existence of the Brisbane River.The Life of Captain Matthew Flinders, R.N. Later in 1823, when the Surveyor General, John Oxley, was commissioned by Governor Brisbane to find sites for further penal settlements, he made a trip to the Moreton Bay area. If it was not for a chance meeting with one of Parson's surviving partners, Thomas Pamphlett, and the men telling him of a large freshwater river they had stumbled across some months earlier, Oxley may never have made the exploration that lead to the establishment of Brisbane Town some years later. By the time of Oxley pulled into Moreton Bay, Parsons was gone. Mistakenly believing that they were somewhere south of Sydney he had set of north on foot. His two companions began to travel with him but, upon reaching the Mooloolah River, Pamphlett decided to return to live with the Moreton Bay natives they had befriended earlier. Later John Finnegan also returned, having quarrelled with Parsons upon reaching the Noosa River. Parsons went on, he believed as far as 'four of five hundred miles'. Most believe this distance to be much exaggerated but he may well have gone as far as present day Central Queensland before he, as he later said, 'began to suspect his error by the extreme heat he felt, as he advanced.'The Australian 21 October 1824, page 2 Parsons eventually returned to Bribie Island from where he was picked up by Oxley on 11 September 1824 and he finally came back to Sydney on 15 October alongside John Oxley's party on board the Government brig Amity.

Service to Morgan operated continuously until April 4, 1948, when the newly created CTA closed the station, due to low ridership and an attempt to speed up and simplify rail service along the line. Soon afterward, the station was demolished. The neighborhood continued to receive elevated service at the Halsted Street station, two blocks to the east. =Former services= Halsted continued to serve the neighborhood until January 9, 1994, when the CTA closed the Green Line for a renovation and rehabilitation project. This project included the closure of six stations, and among them was the Halsted station. With the closure of Halsted, no Green Line stations remained in the West Loop or Fulton Market areas, leaving a gap of between the Ashland and Clinton stations. The closure of Halsted was unpopular, and since that date, community residents, businesses, and local organizations have argued that this area needs a new \\"infill station\\" to restore rail service. Heightening the need for a new station, significant amounts of growth have occurred near the line in the last 15 years, including large residential buildings and many popular restaurants and nightclubs. =New station= View of the new station under construction, looking North on Morgan Street left Morgan was a logical location for a new station, as it is located halfway between Ashland and Clinton, and the intersection of Morgan/Lake is close to much of the new development in the area. It also sits near many art galleries that have opened recently, as well as Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Studios, a major tourist attraction. In the early 2000s, the CTA began to work with local groups and city officials to plan and identify funding sources for the new station. Initially, the neighborhood planned to cover the entire cost with funding from a local tax increment financing district. Later, however, the Chicago Department of Transportation decided to seek federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) Program funding to cover $8 million of the cost, allowing some of the TIF money to be used for other purposes. The final cost of building the station was $38 million. Construction began in Summer 2010.Morgan CTA Green/Pink Line Station , City of Chicago web site.

Arvey (November 3, 1895 - August 25, 1977) was an influential Chicago political leader from the Depression era until the mid-1950s. He may be best known for his efforts to end corruption in the Chicago Democratic organization, and for promoting the candidacies of liberal Democratic politicians such as Adlai Stevenson and Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois. He was known as \\"Jake\\" and \\"Jack\\" at different times in his career. Early life and political career Arvey was the son of Israel and Bertha (n√©e Eisenberg) Arvey, poor Jewish emigrants from Russia. He grew up in Chicago's 24th political ward in the North Lawndale neighborhood on the city's West Side. Arvey never attended college, but did study law, served as a clerk in a Chicago law firm, and eventually passed the Illinois bar exam and became an attorney. On June 11, 1916 he married Edith Freeman; they would remain married until his death in 1977. They had three children: Erwin, Helen and Howard Arvey. In 1923 Arvey was elected to the Chicago city council from his native 24th ward. Known as \\"Jake\\" Arvey, he was the third-ranking member of the powerful political machine led by Chicago Mayor Ed Kelly. A superb political organizer, his organization consistently turned out the largest Democratic majorities (often nine-to-one) of any ward in Chicago, thus enhancing his influence and reputation among the city's Democrats. Reflecting on the qualifications he required for someone to serve in his organization, Arvey once commented that \\"Every man had to belong to a church, a lodge, some other group. He had to be active in the Elks, Masons, K of C, places where he could spread the word about the Democratic Party ... if an apartment was vacant and you moved in, the precinct captain was there to welcome you. He'd get the electricity turned on, perhaps get milk for your children; he'd help with your tax problems. Our organization is geared to the masses, our candidates depend on the precinct captain and our captains are trained to go into the home and make personal contact with the voter.\\" During World War II Arvey temporarily left his political career to serve as a colonel in the U.S. Army; he was the judge advocate of the 33rd Infantry Division, Illinois' National Guard unit, in the Pacific theater of the war. Leader of the organization When Arvey returned from the war in 1945 he was appointed commissioner of the Chicago Park District, and served until 1967. From 1946 to 1950 was also the Chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party. Now known as \\"Colonel\\" or \\"Jack\\" Arvey, he found that the Chicago Democratic organization was in trouble due to numerous scandals and charges of corruption. To improve the organization's reputation and its electoral chances, Arvey began promoting the candidacies of reformers and liberals; he also made a serious effort to clean up the city's politics. He forced Chicago Mayor Edward Joseph Kelly, his former boss and mentor, to retire as mayor when a voter revolt appeared; Arvey instead promoted and helped elect as mayor a prominent businessman, Martin Kennelly. In 1948, Arvey had the Chicago Democratic organization nominate Adlai Stevenson II, grandson of U.S Vice President Adlai E. Stevenson, for Governor of Illinois and Paul Douglas, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, for U.S. Senator.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat;=19770826&id;=hHAsAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=wMsEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=7045,4922481 Both men were well-educated liberals whom Arvey felt would improve the image of the party and attract many independents and moderate Republicans. To improve their chances of winning Arvey joined with several other prominent Democrats, such as Florida Senator Claude Pepper and New Jersey party leader Frank Hague, to try and prevent incumbent President Harry S. Truman from winning the Democratic presidential nomination. Truman was trailing the GOP presidential candidate, Thomas E. Dewey, in the polls, and Arvey feared that Truman would lose by a wide margin in Illinois and drag Stevenson and Douglas to defeat with him. Arvey and his allies promoted the candidacy of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, but the plan failed when Eisenhower refused to run (in 1952 he revealed that he was a Republican and won the GOP nomination). Arvey reluctantly agreed to support Truman for the nomination. However, in a major upset Truman won Illinois ‚Äì and the election ‚Äì by a narrow margin. Both Stevenson and Douglas won their respective elections by landslide margins ‚Äì Stevenson defeated his GOP opponent, incumbent Governor Dwight Green, by 572,000 votes. During his years as governor Stevenson formed an effective working partnership with Arvey. Stevenson agreed to appoint qualified Democratic Party loyalists and workers to lesser positions in the state government; in return Arvey agreed to support Stevenson's efforts to reform the state government, and in particular to end corruption in the Illinois state police by removing political considerations from hiring practices. Political decline Arvey's political influence greatly declined after 1950. The Democratic ticket he had assembled was marred by scandal and the Democrats lost the crucial office of Sheriff. Arvey then resigned under pressure from the county chairmanship, although he remained active in politics.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat;=19770826&id;=hHAsAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=wMsEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=7045,4922481 From 1950 to 1972 Arvey was a member of the Democratic National Committee for Illinois, a prominent if not powerful role.http://www.trumanlibrary.org/hstpaper/arvey.htm Arvey played a role in securing the 1952 Democratic presidential nomination for Stevenson. However, as a presidential candidate Stevenson increasingly ignored Arvey and other professional Democratic politicians in favor of reformers and liberals in the party. In 1955, Richard J. Daley, an Arvey prot√©g√©, was elected Mayor of Chicago. He allowed Arvey to retain his positions on the Park District Board and the Democratic National Committee, but Arvey's influence was limited. Death Jacob Arvey died of heart failure in Chicago's Weiss Memorial Hospital on August 25, 1977, aged 81 and was buried in Chicago. He was survived by his wife and their three children.

Gehman believed that creative people were often emotionally insecure because of an unhappy childhood, and that those who became celebrities in the entertainment industry sometimes did so because their insecurity motivated them to succeed.p.33 Altschuler, Glenn C. & Grossvogel, David I.

He was an expert on African and oriental weevils.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Marshall\\", p. 169). Early life Marshall was the youngest of three children born to Colonel Charles Henry Tilson Marshall (1841-1927), a district judge, and Laura Frances Pollock (1846-1912), daughter of Sir Frederick Pollock, 1st Baronet and Chief Baron of the Exchequer.Descendants of Sir Frederick Pollock Both Guy's father and his uncle, Major-General George Frederick Leycester Marshall (1843-1934), were naturalists who had produced books on the birds and butterflies of India, Burma, and Ceylon. Marshall was sent from India to a school in Margate where he started a butterfly collection. He transferred his attentions to beetles when he enrolled at Charterhouse. When he failed the Indian Civil Service entrance examination, his father shipped him off to Natal in South Africa to learn sheep farming. He ended up in Rhodesia, managing the Salisbury District and Estates Company and owning two farms, one managed by Charles Francis Massy Swynnerton.  Career and Correspondences  Marshall corresponded with the prominent Darwinian, Edward Bagnall Poulton, Hope Professor of Zoology at Oxford University who had written The Colours of Animals (1890). Poulton urged Marshall to study insect colours in mimicry and camouflage. Throughout this research project Marshall put together a collection of plant specimens from southern Africa. His findings were published as a joint paper in Transactions of the Entomological Society of London in 1902. Poulton later helped Marshall in obtaining an appointment at Sarawak Museum. Marshall, however, became ill during a stay-over in London. When some of his papers on weevils were published, he was offered an appointment as scientific secretary to the Entomological Research Committee (Tropical Africa). The Committee's function was to post field entomologists to East and West Africa who would study insects harmful to humans, crops and animals and send specimens to the Natural History Museum in London for identification. Under Marshall‚Äôs management the Committee grew into a powerful and efficient body. Eventually all the agricultural information services were merged as the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux (CAB). Marshall established the biological control service at Farnham House, giving rise to a global network of laboratories and creating two scientific publications: the Bulletin of Entomological Research and the Review of Applied Entomology. Marshall's organisation took on the enormous task of writing up the ‚ÄòInsecta‚Äô division of The Zoological Record. In 1916 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford for his contribution to economic entomology. He was elected Honorary Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society of London Natural History Museum Honors Marshall received many honors - he was elected to the Royal Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Royal Society of New Zealand, the Indian Institute of Science, the Royal Belgian Entomological Society, and the Russian Entomological Society. He was awarded l‚ÄôOrdre de la Couronne from the Belgian Government, a CMG in 1920, a knighthood in 1930, and with his retirement in 1942, the . Marshall's identification work at the institute led to his extensive knowledge of insect taxonomy. His specialising in the Curculionidae was by accident rather than design, as they were the only group left intact after a trip to England in 1896. In total he wrote up some 2300 new species in some 200 papers. After his retirement the Natural History Museum set aside office space for his taxonomic work, with which he continued until shortly before his death.Aluka A species of African dwarf chameleon, Rhampholeon marshalli, is named in his honor.

History left The company started in 1946 when Bill Zimmer and his wife, Roberta, bought a small downtown jewelry store in Wilmington, North Carolina and changed the name to Reeds Jewelers. Later, Reeds opened a store in Whiteville, Jacksonville, and other cities in both North and South Carolina. Bill Zimmer built Reeds' business on the foundation of customer service and respect, which he deemed the Reeds Promise. He would often tell his associates: \\"The most important thing I've learned is that you never argue with a customer. You've just got to do right by people.\\" He carried that philosophy into his treatment of employees, vendors and customers alike, stating that his priorities were to \\"treat all my people like I'd want to be treated, I respect them and I let them know they were loved and appreciated.\\" By 1979, Reeds Jewelers maintained two dozen retail outlets. Alan Zimmer joined Reeds Jewelers as executive vice president in 1981 and took charge of merchandising.

Frank Baum and illustrated by Maginel Wright Enright. First published in 1907, Jack Snow considered it one of the best of Baum's works.David Maxine, ed., Oz- story Magazine No. 2, May 1996; p. 3. The Book In 1906 Baum wrote, and his publisher Reilly & Britton published, a set of six tales for young children, called The Twinkle Tales after their little-girl protagonist. The six were issued in separate chapbooks, but later collected into a volume titled Twinkle and Chubbins: Their Astonishing Adventures in Nature-Fairyland. The series was a hit; Reilly & Britton sold 40,000 copies of the little books in a short time. Such commercial success justified a sequel: Baum took his Policeman Bluejay character from the Twinkle Tale \\"Bandit Jim Crow\\" and cast him in a separate novel, to be issued the following year. Baum published many works ‚Äì adventure stories, melodramas, and juvenile novels ‚Äî under pseudonyms; early experience had taught him that he ended up \\"competing with himself\\" if he released too much material under his own name.L. Frank Baum, Twinkle and Chubbins: Their Astonishing Adventures in Nature-Fairyland, Introduction by Michael Patrick Hearn; Kinderhook, IL, the International Wizard of Oz Club, 1987; Introduction, pp. ii-iii. Both The Twinkle Tales and Policeman Bluejay were printed under the pen name \\"Laura Bancroft\\" ‚Äî the only Baum fantasy works published under a pseudonym. Tongue-in-cheek, Katharine Rogers has called Policeman Bluejay \\"her best work....\\"Katharine M. Rogers, L. Frank Baum, Creator of Oz: A Biography, New York, Macmillan, 2002; p. 149. Oz author and \\"Royal Historian\\" Jack Snow thought Policeman Bluejay Baum's finest fantasy apart from the Oz books.David Maxine, ed., Oz-story Magazine No. 2, May 1996; p. 3. Policeman Bluejay was another success for Baum and his publishers; a second edition appeared in 1911, under the alternative title Babes in Birdland. The third edition of 1917, also under the new title, dropped the pseudonym and acknowledged Baum's authorship. The book was issued in a facsimile edition in 1981,Delmar, NY, Scholars' Facsimiles and Reprints, 1981. and was printed again in the second issue of the annual Oz-story Magazine in 1996. A volume that combined all the \\"Bancroft\\" material appeared in 2005.The Twinkle Tales, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 2005. The illustrations Maginel Wright Enright was in her mid-twenties, and still near the start of her artistic career, when she created the illustrations for The Twinkle Tales and Policeman Bluejay. Her pictures for the \\"Bancroft\\" books have been described as having \\"a child-like grace, a clear clean outline, and a sometimes highly refined decorative sense.\\"Hearn's Introduction to Twinkle and Chubbins, p. xv. The theme The \\"Bancroft\\" works of 1906 and 1907 are united by a general concept: kindness to animals rather than cruelty. Baum recalled from his own childhood, and observed in his own sons, how harsh children can be to vulnerable animals.See Hearn's Introduction to Twinkle and Chubbins, pp. ix-x. Baum wrote a preface to Policeman Bluejay that expressed this goal unambiguously; he noted that along with the \\"amusement\\" the story provides, he hoped it would inspire \\"a little tenderness for the helpless animals and birds\\" his young readers encountered in their lives.For a similar and contemporaneous treatment of the theme, see E. Nesbit's 1912 story collection The Magic World. This goal motivated the most extreme element in Policeman Bluejay ‚Äî the hunting scene in Chapter IX, \\"The Destroyers,\\" an extraordinarily violent scene in a story designed for young children. Synopsis At the story's start, Twinkle and Chubbins are lost in a \\"great forest.\\" They encounter a \\"tuxix\\" ‚Äî a creature that looks like a spiny turtle, but is in reality \\"a magician, a sorcerer, a wizard, and a witch all rolled into one...and you can imagine what a dreadful thing that would be.\\" The evil tuxix casts a spell on the children, transforming them into little bird-like beings, with their own heads but the bodies of skylarks. (They resemble the human-headed, bird-bodied sirins, alkonosts, and gamayuns of Russian folklore.) Policeman Bluejay, the force of order in the avian world of the forest, leads the two child-larks on a flight through the sky; he esconces them in an abandoned thrush's nest in a maple tree, and with the help of a friendly eagle he retrieves their picnic basket (so that they don't have to eat bugs, worms, and grubs). Twinkle and Chubbins learn of their new maple- tree neighbors, a squirrel, an owl, and an o'possum; and Policeman Bluejay introduces them to the community of birds. The children see that the world of living beings in the forest has structure, relationships, and conflict. They hear stories of human cruelty to animals ‚Äì and soon they witness it firsthand, when hunters enter the forest. The hunters kill Mrs. 'Possum and Mrs. Hootaway and Wisk the squirrel; Twinkle tries to protest, but she can only make a skylark's chirp. The hunters' dog almost catches Twinkle ‚Äì but she and Chubbins are rescued by their friend the eagle, who swoops down, kills the dog, and leads them to safety. Or relative safety, at least: the eagle takes the two lark-children up to his eyrie, where his hungry hatchlings want to eat them for breakfast. (Baum acknowledges that animals, to survive, have to prey upon each other. Yet he maintains that \\"love\\" is the Grand Law of the forest.) Policeman Bluejay escorts the children to a safer location. Soon he takes them to the Paradise of Birds, where the contentions and violence of the forest never penetrate. The children are given a tour of its splendors, and meet the King Bird of Paradise. In the \\"suburbs\\" of Paradise, the child-larks are introduced to the community of bees, and meet the Queen Bee; and they witness a spectacular flight of butterflies. Beyond Paradise, in \\"the coarse, outer world,\\" there is trouble in birdland; Policeman Bluejay must cope with a rebellion among the rooks, who would make the other birds their slaves. By uniting, the smaller birds beat the rooks in a battle. The King Bird of Paradise and his Royal Necromancer have told the children that they can restore themselves to human form by eating a fruit called \\"tingle-berries.\\" They do so, and return to their normal bodies ‚Äì though Chubbins almost gets stuck halfway. Their adventure done, the children make their way home in the waning light of evening. The Paradise of Birds Baum enriches the text of Policeman Bluejay with realistic details of the natural world. Yet Baum was not a naturalist but a fantasist, and the seven chapters (XII ‚Äì XVIII) that he devotes to the Paradise of Birds are the heart of the fantasy. The author restricts himself to a simple language for his young audience; yet within this simplicity he paints a lush, lustrous, luxuriant prose poem of imaginative effects. Policeman Bluejay delivers his young charges to the Guardian of the Entrance to Paradise (the Jay himself is too deeply tainted by the outer world to enter). The Guardian accepts them and turns them over to Ephel, the Royal Messenger, who guides them on their tour. Ephel brings them to the royal court of the King Bird of Paradise; the King's lecture on the virtue of vanity is the comic high point of the book. Ephel shows the children the Lustrous Lake with its singing fish, the curious lake of dry water, and the Gleaming Glade where the birds perform their Beauty Dance. The Paradise of Birds is in fact Eden: \\"There is a legend that man once lived there, but for some unknown crime was driven away. But the birds have always been allowed to inhabit the place because they did no harm.\\" Since these are \\"fairy Birds of Paradise,\\" they occupy their own domain of reality; the reader does not need to picture actual birds-of-paradise in an actual American woodland. (Baum's combination of Eden with fairyland raises interesting complexities.) Baum exploits concepts and images that are used by fantasists before and after him; readers familiar with the genre will perceive echoes of other works. The Paradise of Birds has trees \\"not made of wood, but having trunks of polished gold and silver and leaves of exquisite metallic colorings\\" ‚Äî reminiscent of the gold and silver foliage in The Twelve Dancing Princesses. The barrier of wind that prevents entrance to the Paradise foreshadows the similar barrier in Lord Dunsany's The King of Elfland's Daughter. And the flowers with human faces in Chapter XV have a range of parallels. The form Baum's Policeman Bluejay partakes of a deep tradition in literature and storytelling, folklore and myth, which employs the animal world, especially birds and bees, as metaphor for the human condition. Chaucer's The Parliament of Fowls is probably the best-known work in this vein, though various others can be cited,See Shakespeare's The Phoenix and the Turtle, in which the two birds, phoenix and turtle dove, represent people. most commonly involving birds,Malcolm Andrew, ed., Two Early Renaissance Bird Poems: The Harmony of Birds, The Parliament of Birds, Washington DC, Folger Books, 1984. and in Indian, Persian, and Arabic literature as well as Western.Farid Ud-Din Attar and Edward Fitzgerald, Bird Parliament, Dodo Press, 2008. The trope re-appears in twentieth-century poetry,Elise Emmons, The Parliament of Birds and Other Poems, Boston, Christopher Publishing House, 1924.John Heath-Stubbs, A Parliament of Birds, London, Chatto & Windus, 1975. and in the early twenty-first it is still used to reach and teach young children.Ali Garnett and Kaye Kessing, A Parliament of Birds and Cockatoo island, Scarborough, ON, Nelson Thomson Learning, 2003. In regard to bees, John Day's play The Parliament of Bees is arguably the most famous of a number of related works. (One major distinction applies: writers like Chaucer and Day were primarily interested in commenting on human society, and used their animal metaphors as means to that end. In Baum's book, the animals and their welfare are the central consideration.) More generally, talking animals and human/animal transformation are virtually universal in world folklore. Baum's animal fable participates in this ancient tradition.Baum wrote other works in the animal-fable genre, notably in his Animal Fairy Tales of 1905.

The risk of complications increases with the severity of the trauma; however even mild traumatic brain injury can result in disabilities that interfere with social interactions, employment, and everyday living. TBI can cause a variety of problems including physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral complications. Symptoms that may occur after a concussion ‚Äì a minor form of traumatic brain injury ‚Äì are referred to as post-concussion syndrome. Effects on unconsciousness Generally, there are six abnormal states of consciousness that can result from a TBI: * Stupor is a state of partial or near complete unconsciousness in which the patient is lethargic, immobile, and has a reduced response to stimuli.. * Coma is a state in which the patient is totally unconscious and cannot be aroused even with strong stimuli. * Persistent vegetative state is a condition in which awake patients are unconscious and unaware of their surroundings and the cerebral cortex is not functioning.. A vegetative state can result from diffuse injury to the cerebral hemispheres of the brain without damage to the lower brain and brainstem. The vegetative state is considered permanent if it persists for 12 months after TBI or 3 months after causes other than trauma. * A minimally conscious state is a condition in which patients have a reduced level of arousal and may appear, on the surface, to be in a persistent vegetative state but are capable of demonstrating the ability to actively process information. * Locked-in syndrome is a condition in which a patient is aware and awake, but cannot move or communicate due to complete paralysis of the body.. Voluntary control of eye movements or blinking may be spared, permitting the detection of conscious awareness and enabling the establishment of functional communication. * Brain death is the irreversible loss of measurable brain function, with loss of any integrated activity among distinct areas of the brain. Breathing and heart function must be maintained with assistive devices.. Disorders of consciousness affect a significant number of people who suffer severe TBI; of those with severe TBI discharged from a hospital, are in a vegetative state, and of this number only half regain consciousness within one to three years. Cognitive deficits Most patients with severe TBI who recover consciousness suffer from cognitive disabilities, including the loss of many higher-level mental skills. Cognitive deficits that can follow TBI include impaired attention; disrupted insight, judgement, and thought; reduced processing speed; distractibility; and deficits in executive functions such as abstract reasoning, planning, problem-solving, and multitasking. Memory loss, the most common cognitive impairment among head-injured people, occurs in 20‚Äì79% of people with closed head trauma, depending on severity. Post- traumatic amnesia (PTA), a confusional state with impaired memory, is characterized by loss of specific memories or the partial inability to form or store new ones. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized by dementia, memory loss, and deteriorating cognitive abilities. Research suggests an association between head injury in early adulthood and the development of AD later in life; the more severe the head injury, the greater the risk of developing AD. Some evidence indicates that a head injury may interact with other factors to trigger the disease and may hasten the onset of the disease in individuals already at risk. For example, head-injured people who have a particular form of the protein apolipoprotein E (apoE4, a naturally occurring protein that helps transport cholesterol through the bloodstream) fall into this increased risk category. Patients with moderate to severe TBI have more problems with cognitive deficits than do those with mild TBI, but several mild TBIs may have an additive effect. About one in five career boxers is affected by chronic traumatic brain injury (CTBI), which causes cognitive, behavioral, and physical impairments. Dementia pugilistica, also called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is the severe form of CTBI. Caused by repetitive blows to the head over a long period, the condition primarily affects career boxers and has recently been linked to other contact sports including American football and ice hockey as well as military service(see Ann McKee). It commonly manifests as dementia, or declining mental ability, memory problems, and parkinsonism (tremors and lack of coordination). Symptoms begin anywhere between 6 and 40 years after the start of a boxing career, with an average onset of about 16 years. Communication problems Language and communication problems are common disabilities in TBI patients. Some may experience aphasia, difficulty with understanding and producing spoken and written language; or they may have difficulty with the more subtle aspects of communication, such as body language and emotional, non-verbal signals. Some may have problems with intonation or inflection, called prosodic dysfunction. Problems with spoken language may occur if the part of the brain that controls speech muscles is damaged. In this disorder, called dysarthria, the patient can think of the appropriate language, but cannot easily speak the words because they are unable to use the muscles needed to form the words and produce the sounds. Speech is often slow, slurred, and garbled. Sensory deficits TBI patients may have sensory problems, especially problems with vision; they may not be able to register what they are seeing or may be slow to recognize objects. Also, TBI patients often have difficulty with hand‚Äìeye coordination, causing them to seem clumsy or unsteady. Other sensory deficits include problems with hearing, smell, taste, or touch. Tinnitus, a ringing or roaring in the ears, may occur. A person with damage to the part of the brain that processes taste or smell may perceive a persistent bitter taste or noxious smell. Damage to the part of the brain that controls the sense of touch may cause a TBI patient to develop persistent skin tingling, itching, or pain. These conditions are rare and difficult to treat. Emotional and behavioral problems TBI may cause emotional or behavioral problems and changes in personality. Emotional symptoms that can follow TBI include emotional instability, depression, anxiety, hypomania, mania, apathy, irritability, and anger. TBI appears to predispose a person to psychiatric disorders including obsessive compulsive disorder, alcohol or substance abuse or substance dependence, dysthymia, clinical depression, bipolar disorder, phobias, panic disorder, and schizophrenia. About one quarter of people with TBI suffer from clinical depression, and about 9% suffer mania. The prevalence of all psychiatric illnesses is 49% in moderate to severe TBI and 34% in mild TBI within a year of injury, compared with 18% of controls. People with TBI continue to be at greater risk for psychiatric problems than others even years after an injury. Problems that may persist for up to two years after the injury include irritability, suicidal ideation, insomnia, and loss of the ability to experience pleasure from previously enjoyable experiences. Behavioral symptoms that can follow TBI include disinhibition, inability to control anger, impulsiveness, lack of initiative, inappropriate sexual activity, and changes in personality. Different behavioral problems are characteristic of the location of injury; for instance, frontal lobe injuries often result in disinhibition and inappropriate or childish behavior, and temporal lobe injuries often cause irritability and aggression. Physical complications The relative risk of post-traumatic seizures increases with the severity of traumatic brain injury. Pain, especially headache, is a common complication following a TBI. Being unconscious and lying still for long periods can cause blood clots to form (deep venous thrombosis), which can cause pulmonary embolism. Other serious complications for patients who are unconscious, in a coma, or in a vegetative state include pressure sores, pneumonia or other infections, and progressive multiple organ failure. The risk of post-traumatic seizures increases with severity of trauma (image at right) and is particularly elevated with certain types of brain trauma such as cerebral contusions or hematomas. As many as 50% of people with penetrating head injuries will develop seizures. People with early seizures, those occurring within a week of injury, have an increased risk of post-traumatic epilepsy (recurrent seizures occurring more than a week after the initial trauma) though seizures can appear a decade or more after the initial injury and the common seizure type may also change over time. Generally, medical professionals use anticonvulsant medications to treat seizures in TBI patients within the first week of injury only and after that only if the seizures persist. Neurostorms may occur after a severe TBI. The lower the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), the higher the chance of Neurostorming. Neurostorms occur when the patient's Autonomic Nervous System (ANS), Central Nervous System (CNS), Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS), and ParaSympathetic Nervous System (PSNS) become severely compromised https://www.brainline.org/story/neurostorm- century-part-1-3-medical-terminology . This in turn can create the following potential life-threatening symptoms: increased IntraCranial Pressure (ICP), tachycardia, tremors, seizures, fevers, increased blood pressure, increased Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF), and diaphoresis https://www.brainline.org/story/neurostorm-century-part-1-3-medical- terminology. A variety of medication may be used to help decrease or control Neurostorm episodes https://www.brainline.org/story/neurostorm-century- part-3-3-new-way-life. Parkinson's disease and other motor problems as a result of TBI are rare but can occur. Parkinson's disease, a chronic and progressive disorder, may develop years after TBI as a result of damage to the basal ganglia. Other movement disorders that may develop after TBI include tremor, ataxia (uncoordinated muscle movements), and myoclonus (shock-like contractions of muscles). Skull fractures can tear the meninges, the membranes that cover the brain, leading to leaks of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A tear between the dura and the arachnoid membranes, called a CSF fistula, can cause CSF to leak out of the subarachnoid space into the subdural space; this is called a subdural hygroma. CSF can also leak from the nose and the ear. These tears can also allow bacteria into the cavity, potentially causing infections such as meningitis. Pneumocephalus occurs when air enters the intracranial cavity and becomes trapped in the subarachnoid space. Infections within the intracranial cavity are a dangerous complication of TBI. They may occur outside of the dura mater, below the dura, below the arachnoid (meningitis), or within the brain itself (abscess). Most of these injuries develop within a few weeks of the initial trauma and result from skull fractures or penetrating injuries. Standard treatment involves antibiotics and sometimes surgery to remove the infected tissue. Injuries to the base of the skull can damage nerves that emerge directly from the brain (cranial nerves). Cranial nerve damage may result in: * Paralysis of facial muscles * Damage to the nerves responsible for eye movements, which can cause double vision * Damage to the nerves that provide sense of smell * Loss of vision * Loss of facial sensation * Swallowing problems Hydrocephalus, post-traumatic ventricular enlargement, occurs when CSF accumulates in the brain, resulting in dilation of the cerebral ventricles and an increase in ICP. This condition can develop during the acute stage of TBI or may not appear until later. Generally it occurs within the first year of the injury and is characterized by worsening neurological outcome, impaired consciousness, behavioral changes, ataxia (lack of coordination or balance), incontinence, or signs of elevated ICP. Any damage to the head or brain usually results in some damage to the vascular system, which provides blood to the cells of the brain. The body can repair small blood vessels, but damage to larger ones can result in serious complications. Damage to one of the major arteries leading to the brain can cause a stroke, either through bleeding from the artery or through the formation of a blood clot at the site of injury, blocking blood flow to the brain. Blood clots also can develop in other parts of the head. Other types of vascular complications include vasospasm, in which blood vessels constrict and restrict blood flow, and the formation of aneurysms, in which the side of a blood vessel weakens and balloons out. Fluid and hormonal imbalances can also complicate treatment. Hormonal problems can result from dysfunction of the pituitary, the thyroid, and other glands throughout the body. Two common hormonal complications of TBI are syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone and hypothyroidism. Another common problem is spasticity. In this situation, certain muscles of the body are tight or hypertonic because they cannot fully relax.

According to some sources,Solid! he became the leader by chance when the band was performing at the Hershey Ballroom in Hershey, Pennsylvania. The band leader at the time had an argument with the players and walked out. Hamp, who never played a musical instrument in spite of being a jazz fan and had no experience as a conductor (in addition, he only sang whenever the chorus was performed by a vocal ensemble or the whole band), volunteered to lead them for the rest of the evening and they accepted. After the performance, the band asked him to stay on as leader.

The group toured in the eastern United States and toured England in 1930. In 1931, the group was renamed Johnny Hamp and His Orchestra. The group made most of its recordings in New York City on the Victor label. Their biggest hit was \\"Black Bottom\\" recorded in 1926, which led to a dance fad; see Black Bottom (dance). Hamp continued to record for Victor until April, 1932. The next session was in August, 1935 for ARC (Melotone, Perfect, Romeo, Oriole). In December, 1936, Hamp was back with Victor recording for their Bluebird label for only two sessions (the second in February, 1937), which turned out to be their last session.

A person who receives a DAT has been arrested. The DAT is simply one of two alternative means by which a person who is arrested appears for arraignment, or first appearance. A person who receives a DAT is permitted to appear in court on their own on the date indicated on the DAT document. A person who does not receive a DAT is processed through the arrest to arraignment system and is supposed to have their arraignment within 24 hours. From the point that the case is arraigned, a DAT case is like any other criminal case. DATs may be issued for violation, misdemeanors, and \\"E\\" felonies. If a person fails to return to court on the date indicated on the DAT, the Court will issue an arrest warrant. The authority for a DAT is found in Criminal Procedure Law ¬ß150.10, which describes a DAT as \\"a written notice issued and subscribed by a police officer... directing a designated person to appear in a designated local criminal court at a designated future time in connection with his alleged commission of a designated offense.\\" Beginning January 1, 2020, new rules imposed by the New York State Legislature as part of sweeping criminal justice reform in New York State have significantly changed Desk Appearance Ticket procedures. Chief among those changes is that the vast majority of misdemeanor and now many felony charges require the use of Desk Appearance Tickets. The decision to proceed by way of desk appearance ticket is no longer discretionary with the police in the vast majority of circumstances. Exceptions to the mandatory desk appearance ticket requirement include sex offenses, offenses against family members, and offenses where license suspension or the issuance of orders of protection is possible. A universal summons (summons ticket) is another type of appearance ticket (authorized by CPL article 150) that directs a defendant to appear for arraignment at a future date, but it also serves as the accusatory instrument (unlike a complaint filed by a prosecutor, as with a DAT) and the defendant is not arrested.

The side now has two chapters, the Hong Kong Morris and the Hong Kong (UK) Morris, colloquially known as The Brackets, in the United Kingdom. In its heyday, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Hong Kong Morris was one of the largest Cotswold morris sides in the world. The side maintains that it is committed to the principles of multiculturalism and inclusivity, and has always encouraged a multicultural membership and mixed dancing. The return of the former British colony of Hong Kong to China in 1997 has had no effect on the side's activities, and it continues to flourish as a notable example of the resilience of Western cultural activity in postcolonial Hong Kong.  Early history  Hong Kong Morris founder members Jim Carter (left) and Tony Reynolds The Hong Kong Morris was founded by Jim Carter in 1974. Many of its early members were officers of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force. One founding member, Tony Reynolds, was a Quaker who had driven ambulances along the Burma Road during the Second World War. The side met to practice at St John's Cathedral in Garden Road, Hong Kong Island. In the 1980s the side attracted British expatriates working in Hong Kong, teachers and engineers being particularly well represented. The side's numbers reached a peak in the mid-1980s, at around 50 dancers and musicians. Due to the increase in the team's numbers the practice venue was moved in the early 1980s to South Island School. In 1985 the side was featured in the Morris Ring publication The Morris Tradition, as an example of the spread of morris dancing beyond its traditional home in England.The Morris Tradition (Morris Ring, 1985): 'The work of collecting and interpreting the dances has been continued today by Roy Dommett, Lionel Bacon and many others, and the fruits of their labours can be seen in towns and villages all over England, and indeed in Europe, America, Australia and even Hong Kong.' The feature was illustrated by a photograph showing the Hong Kong Morris dancing the Upton-on-Severn stick dance at a District Board performance in Sha Tin in July 1984.  Notable events  The Hong Kong Morris at the Wishing Tree, San Uk Tsai, May 2008 The side has typically danced either at open-air venues in Hong Kong such as fetes and festivals or in air-conditioned shopping malls. During the mid-1980s the Hong Kong Morris performed on most weekends, though in recent years performances have been less frequent. In 1987 the side danced on top of a decorated shipping container swung out over Kwai Chung Creek on a crane to mark the opening of a new berth at Kwai Chung Container Terminals. In 1988, in order to benefit from the waiver of fees granted by the Urban Council to charitable, religious and educational groups for the use of its premises, the Hong Kong Morris successfully argued that it was a religious group on the grounds that morris dancing was a survival of a pre-Christian fertility rite. This myth was exploded with the publication in 1999 of A History of Morris Dancing, John Forrest's magisterial study of the historical roots of morris dancing (no earlier than the fifteenth century), and is no longer an argument that the side could make with a good conscience. The Hong Kong Morris celebrates its twentieth anniversary in 1994 in Hong Kong Park. In the 1980s the team was one of the largest Cotswold morris sides in the world In 1990 and 1991 three four-person teams from the Hong Kong Morris took part in the annual Trailwalker competition, an event that involves walking the 100 kilometres of the Maclehose Trail within a period of 48 hours. On both occasions the walkers changed into morris kit near the end of the trail, danced across the finishing line, and took part in a vigorous display of morris dancing afterwards. In 1991 the side danced at Hei Ling Chau refugee camp. Its audience consisted of several hundred Vietnamese boat people who had fled from Vietnam and had been interned upon their arrival in Hong Kong. In 1994 the side celebrated its twentieth anniversary in Hong Kong. A large number of former members returned to Hong Kong from the UK and Canada to take part in the celebrations. In 1997, shortly before the handover of Hong Kong to China, the Hong Kong Morris held The Last Ale of the Empire. In 2004 the side celebrated its thirtieth anniversary. Again, several former members returned to Hong Kong for the anniversary. The celebrations included dancing in Hong Kong Park, in Stanley, and outside the Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui. In 2008 and 2009 the Hong Kong Morris celebrated May Morning by dancing next to the Wishing Tree in San Uk Tsai, a locally celebrated banyan tree believed to bring good fortune to its devotees.  The Brackets  Hong Kong Morris and Brackets reunion in Macau, October 2008 In 1984 China and the United Kingdom issued a Joint Declaration providing for the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997. In the late 1980s, largely due to localisation policies implemented in preparation for the 1997 handover, many of the side's members returned to the United Kingdom. These members met for a weekend of dance at Wimborne, Dorset in 1991, at which the decision was taken to form the Hong Kong (UK) Morris, colloquially known as The Brackets. Initial Brackets gatherings took place at the annual Sidmouth Folk Festival in Devon, normally held at the end of July. In January 1993 a recently returned Hong Kong Morris member organised a weekend of dance for The Brackets and the Brackley Morris Men in Northamptonshire. The idea of a January gathering in addition to the July Sidmouth reunion caught on, and The Brackets now regularly meet and dance together in the first week of January as well as at Sidmouth. A Media take on the Side's 'Thirty-Fifth Anniversary' Many of the Brackets became members of local morris sides after their return to the UK, but all retain an allegiance to the Hong Kong Morris. Throughout the 1990s members of the Hong Kong and UK sides met up annually at the Sidmouth Folk Festival, and links between the two sides remain strong. Many members of The Brackets returned to Hong Kong in 1994 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the foundation of the Hong Kong Morris, and several Brackets members also helped to celebrate the side's 30th anniversary in 2004. A strong side of Brackets visited Hong Kong in October 2008, and the local and UK sides danced together in Stanley, on Lamma Island and in Macau.Macau Daily Times, 3 November 2008  Constitution and offices  The Hong Kong Morris is registered under the Societies Ordinance (Cap. 151 of the Laws of Hong Kong), a local ordinance introduced by the Hong Kong Government to counter the threat of subversion. The ordinance allows the government to monitor the activities of political parties, pressure groups and other potentially-undesirable combinations, and under its provisions the side is required to furnish the government every year with copies of its accounts and the minutes of its annual general meeting. As with many other morris sides, the officers of the Hong Kong Morris include a squire (president), a bagman (treasurer) and a foreman (dance teacher). In 1989, in recognition of the wish of the women members to develop their own dance traditions, the office of foreman was replaced with a men's foreman and a women's foreman.  Costume  The men's side of the Hong Kong Morris wear white trousers and shirts. Their baldricks, red and yellow with green highlights, are decorated with a badge, which was designed in 1976 by Sue King, representing a Chinese dragon behind a rapper sword knot. All three colours, but particularly red, are considered lucky in Chinese tradition, and drew attention away from the men's white shirts and trousers. White is the colour worn at funerals in China, and is considered inauspicious. This costume was lightly modified in 1984. The Hong Kong Morris colour palette (red, yellow and green) influenced the costume of the Vancouver Morris Men , one of Canada's most illustrious morris sides. Graham Baldwin, one of the earliest members of the Hong Kong Morris, founded the Vancouver Morris Men in 1982, and chose the same colours for the costume of the Vancouver side. The costume of the Hong Kong Morris women's side has undergone changes over the years. The first women's costume consisted of a white blouse and a skirt available in light green, russet brown, or pink. In 1984 this early costume was replaced with a uniform costume designed by Annette Frizell, consisting of a red skirt, a white blouse and a green waistcoat. At present many of the women dancers continue to wear the costume introduced in 1984, though some dancers prefer a modified open-neck version of the 1984-model white blouse. Other dancers wear the same costume as the men. The sticks used by the side in its dances are wrapped in tape in three broad bands of colour: red, white and green. The green end of the stick is always held uppermost, so that any blood shed in an incautious stick clash is disguised by dripping onto the lower red band. Many morris sides include one or more members dressed as animals, typically horses. The Hong Kong Morris has its own hobby horse named Horace, normally represented by Martin Samson.  Dancing traditions  Most of the dances performed by the Hong Kong Morris are from the Cotswold Morris tradition. Cotswold traditions danced at various periods in the side's history include Adderbury, Ascot-under-Wychwood, Bampton, Bledington, Bucknell, Fieldtown, Headington, Lichfield, Stanton Harcourt and Upton-on-Severn. At periods in its history the side has also performed longsword dances, garland dances, rapper dances and mumming plays. While the Hong Kong Morris has always regarded Lionel Bacon's classic work A Handbook of Morris DancesA Handbook of Morris Dances 1974 as a most valuable source of information on the form and historical development of particular morris tunes and morris dances, it has never felt the need to adhere slavishly to the particular form in which a dance or tune was collected several decades ago. The side has therefore contributed to the development of the morris tradition by adapting a number of existing dances to local circumstances. In the early 1980s the Hong Kong Morris developed a variant of the Lichfield Morris tradition, designed to be viewed from above when being danced on the circular ground-floor stage of the multi-storey shopping mall The Landmark. Instead of the conventional set of eight dancers, the Hong Kong Morris danced Lichfield with twelve dancers arranged in a cross formation. This formation enabled spectacular effects to be achieved, particularly in the complex Lichfield Hey. Other dances similarly adapted include the Upton-on-Yangtze stick dance, a version of the Upton-on-Severn stick dance performed in traditional Chinese costume with chopsticks, and Governor's Gallop, a dance developed in the early 1990s in honour of Chris Patten, Hong Kong's last British governor.  Music  The main musicians for the Hong Kong side are Sue Ellis and Sue Papper (melodeons), and for the Brackets Steve Butler/Hall, John Bacon (both piano accordions), John Rowlands (button accordion) and June Rowlands (fiddle). The squeezebox and fiddle players normally carry the main burden of the tune, while attractive decorative effects are produced by supporting musicians with less powerful instruments. Bill Crump and Dave Ellis, for example, use the tin whistle to counterpoint and harmonise with the main melody. While most of the side's musicians play traditional morris instruments (the piano accordion, the button accordion, the melodeon, the concertina, the fiddle, the guitar, the bodhran and the tin whistle), the Hong Kong Morris has never refused less conventional instruments. The late Mike Cowley's inimitable performance on the trombone (Mike died on 18 November 2010) will be particularly missed, as it gave the side's music a depth and volume that considerably enhanced the performance of the dancers and at times reduced them to tears of laughter.  Mumming play and rapper dancing The Hong Kong Morris has for many years performed an English mumming play. Texts of a large number of medieval mumming plays have survived, and the play performed by the side is in the mainstream mumming play tradition. It contains the characters Father Christmas, Saint George and the Turkish Knight. In the late 1980s and early 1990s the mumming play actors also included a display of rapper sword dancing in their performance. The impact of these performances was considerably enhanced by the striking costumes produced for the actors by side member Chris Baldwin, a devotee of amateur dramatics.  Singing  The Hong Kong Morris has always loved to sing: May Day celebrations, 2008 Singing (mostly of English folk songs) has always played a role in the apres-morris conviviality of the Hong Kong Morris. Jim Carter, Hilary Blythe and Phil Pimentil, three of the side's early members, were noted singers on the local folk scene as part of the group Mulled Ale, and launched a tradition of powerful singing. Several other regular singers have maintained this tradition, including Mary Read and Amy Hughes (romantic ballads), Mike Greenhalgh (sea shanties), Dave Wilmshurst ('Death to the French' songs), Steve Ford (folksong parodies) and Dave Ellis (drinking songs). Kyoko Fukuda has recently widened the side's singing repertoire with two songs sung in Japanese: one about an elephant, known as The Elephant Song,Ë±°„Åï„Çì„ÅÆÊ≠å zou-san no uta and one about something else, known jokingly as The Not-the-Elephant Song. Phil Pimentil used to sing one of the few English folksongs known to have mentioned Hong Kong, about an Irish navvy who found work in the British colony in the late nineteenth century: 'I'm off to be a Chinaman, to Hong Kong I'm bound.'Hong Kong is also mentioned in a variant of the English sea shanty Blow the Man Down. The word \\"Chinaman\\" is replaced with \\"flying-fish sailor\\" in the version of \\"Blow the Man Down\\" collected by Clive Carey (1883‚Äì1968) Another song with a China connection, The Chinese Bumboatman Song,Lyrics The Chinese bumboatman Words & music (c) Harry Nelson & Tim Drake. Registration Number / Date: EU0000464898 / 1957-02-06 also known as The Ballad of Wing Chang Loo, has become a side favourite, and is sometimes delivered with 'an horrible oath' (as the song requires) in Cantonese, depending on the company.  Oratory  An important aspect of any morris side's performance is rapport with its audience, and good speakers can make all the difference to a side's reception. The late Jim Carter was one of the side's most effective orators in its early days, and his baton has been passed on to Roger Pope, who brings to his task the humour and gravitas won in his chosen career as a school headmaster. When dancing for Chinese audiences in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Morris always tries to make its announcements in Cantonese. Several of its expatriate members have enough Cantonese to make themselves understood on such occasions.  Inclusivity and multiculturalism  The Hong Kong Morris attracted its first women members in the late 1970s, at a time when there was opposition to women's morris dancing in the United Kingdom. Women and men have always danced together in the Hong Kong Morris, either in mixed sets or in separate sets. By the mid-1980s the side's growing numbers enabled strong men's and women's sets to develop, and each set began to specialise in certain Cotswold traditions, while retaining a large common core of dances for mixed dancing. In 1989 a women's foreman was added to the side's officers. The Hong Kong Morris was briefly a member side of the Morris Ring, but was asked to leave the Ring because of its inclusive policy on women's dancing. It is now a member side of the Morris Federation. Two of its members, John Bacon and Chris Butler/Hall, have played an influential role respectively in the development of the policies of the Morris Federation and Open Morris, two organisations in the United Kingdom committed to the principle of mixed dancing. The side has also welcomed dancers and musicians of all nationalities. Although most of its members have been English, it has also had Hong Kong Chinese, Scottish, American, Australian, New Zealand, French, South African, Thai, Ukrainian and Japanese members.  Invention of traditions  Farewell ale for Hong Kong Morris stalwarts Sue and Dave Ellis, 25 September 2009 A number of traditions were invented by the Hong Kong Morris in the early 1980s, some of which have survived. These include an adaptation of the Oxford custom May Morning, a ritual that includes dancing on The Peak at dawn followed by a hearty breakfast and still more dancing; Macau trips, including evenings of singing and dancing at the Pousada da Coloane hotel and lunch at Fernando's restaurant on Hac Sa Beach; junk trips to the Lamma Island Wan Kee Seafood Restaurant; Boxing Day dancing; and a send-off 'ale' for departing members of the side.  Overseas tours  The Hong Kong Morris performs a traditional mumming play in Canberra, 1997 The first overseas tour by the Hong Kong Morris was to Manila in 1980. In 1984 a strong Hong Kong Morris side visited Perth (Australia) and danced with the local ladies' side The Fair Maids of Perth. Subsequent tours have included the 1986 Guangzhou Tour, the 1987 North American Tour to Seattle, Victoria and Vancouver (a tour in which the side danced with the US sides MossyBacks and Misty City and the Canadian Victoria and Vancouver Morris sides); the 1988 Brisbane Tour to Maleny Folk Festival, at which the side's musician was asked to accompany an Australian women's side of practising witches; the 1989 Taiwan Tour, whose participants enjoyed the unfamiliar experience of being cultural ambassadors for British education; the 1990 Bangkok Tour; the 1995 Kuala Lumpur Tour, which doubled as a honeymoon for recently married Steve and Myra Ford; and the 1997 Canberra Tour, where the Hong Kong Morris provided a visual history of morris dancing as a specially- invited side, performed its mumming play and led a session of chorus singing.  Visits to Hong Kong by overseas sides  Hong Kong and Cyprus Morris at Tai Hang, 6 November 2010 The Hong Kong Morris is the only morris side in Hong Kong, and has therefore welcomed visits from other morris sides. Teams that have danced in Hong Kong as guests of the Hong Kong Morris include the Australian side The Fair Maids of Perth (1985, in return for the 1984 Perth Tour), the American sides MossyBack Morris Men and Misty City (1988, in return for the 1987 North American Tour), and the UK clog dancing side Kettle Bridge Clogs (1989). Several former members of the Hong Kong Morris now dance with other sides, and occasionally revisit their old haunts. Peter and Christine Baldwin, now with the Cyprus Morris, danced with the Hong Kong Morris in November 2010 in the village of Tai Hang in the Lam Tsuen valley.

The 179th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 5, 2008. The episode depicts Barack Obama after winning the presidential election against John McCain. In a satire of American Partisan Politics, mass hysteria ensues as Liberals celebrate with drunken rioting and Conservatives experience apocalyptic panic. Meanwhile, Obama, McCain, and their respective campaign staffs are revealed to be a gang of jewel thieves who ran for president as part of a heist. In a parody of the films Ocean's Eleven and Entrapment, Obama and McCain use the hype and fear of Election Night to carry out a high-tech heist from the Smithsonian. Parker and Stone briefly considered parodying Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight by having then-President George W. Bush gallantly take the blame for the Smithsonian heist. They decided against it, however, as they felt that jokes about President Bush had been \\"done to death\\". The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker is rated TV-MA L in the United States. Plot Following the announcement of the 2008 presidential election results, Barack Obama and John McCain address their supporters on national television as the people of South Park watch. The town's Democrats, including Randy and Sharon Marsh and the Broflovskis, express a belief that Obama is the Messiah, crudely taunt their Republican neighbors and begin to celebrate drunkenly in the streets. Meanwhile, the town's Republicans, including the Stotches, Mr. Garrison and Mr. Mackey, sit despondently inside, certain that a liberal President means that the Apocalypse is at hand. Ike Broflovski, who supported McCain, attempts suicide by jumping out a first-story window. Certain that Ike is badly injured, Stan Marsh and Kyle Broflovski put him in a child's wagon and try to take him to the hospital. Meanwhile, Obama and McCain turn out to be friends and the leaders of a jewel heist club known as the \\"Presidential Crime Syndicate\\". Furthermore, Michelle Obama is really an ace computer hacker and single mother who has faked marriage to Obama to make him electable. Sarah Palin is secretly an extremely intelligent, poised, and articulate Englishwoman. The Syndicate has conspired to win the election by running Obama and McCain against each other, so that the winner can access a hidden tunnel from the Oval Office, break into the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History, and steal the Hope Diamond. In South Park, Stan and Kyle vainly search through the partying Democrats to find anyone who can drive Ike to the hospital. They watch as Randy, believing that Obama's win means that he no longer needs a job, punches his equally liberal boss in the face and breaks his nose. When Officer Barbrady attempts to restore order, the drunken crowd assumes that he must be a Republican, loudly boos him, and overturns his police car. Stan and Kyle find the Stotches building an \\"ark\\" while keeping many horrified conservatives from entering due to space limitations. The boys' plea for help leads to a brawl among the terrified Republicans and the boys head for the hospital on foot. They find the emergency room packed with Democrats who have partied too hard and Republicans who have tried to kill themselves. Obama and Michelle break into the Museum, cross a room full of lasers, and steal the Hope Diamond. Ike, who had been a member of the heist the entire time, blows up a private jet that contains dummies of the criminals and alters hospital records to declare everyone involved legally dead. The next day, as the Syndicate prepares to leave the country, Obama announces that he will not be going with them. Instead, he convinces Michelle to stay behind and \\"give this President thing a shot\\". The following morning, South Park's Republicans emerge from their \\"ark\\" and realize that the world has not ended. Realizing that they can vote Obama out later if he does a bad job, the Conservatives decide to give the new President a chance. That same morning, Randy Marsh wakes up on his couch with a severe hangover, his pants missing, and his TV having been stolen by Eric Cartman while he was out partying. Stan delivers a message from Randy's boss, telling him that he has been fired, and Randy‚Äîtaking this as evidence that Obama lied to the voters‚Äîflies into a rage and shouts that he should have voted for McCain. Themes An interpretation of the episode summarized its contents as a condemnation of those who care too much about political issues. The episode satirizes the variety of reactions from liberals and conservatives in the aftermath of election returns: \\"somewhere between a boozy orgy of celebratory puking in the streets and apocalyptic panic\\". The episode exaggerates their reactions to extremes to illustrate possible absurdity. Production The episode's plot originated before the season began, when the writing team began brainstorming episode ideas. Parker and Stone noticed that an episode from the run could air the day following the election, and set their sights on producing an episode. Parker was particularly set on producing the episode after seeing the uproar over a joke from a recent Family Guy episode (\\"Road to Germany\\"), in which the character of Stewie, dressed as a Nazi, sports a McCain-Palin button. South Park had previously criticized the program with the 2006 two-parter \\"Cartoon Wars Part I\\" and \\"Cartoon Wars Part II\\", and Parker intensely disliked the joke. Rather than focus the episode's plot as satiric commentary on modern politics, the duo instead decided to create an absurd, action-movie plot inspired by the film Ocean's Eleven. \\"We've all heard about everything; we've talked about everything to death,\\" Parker said. \\"And it's like, let's just put him in a diamond heist movie. They're just diamond thieves, and it's not about the politics at all anymore.\\" After coming up with a neutral plot that would not disclose who would win the election, it gradually became obvious over the season that Obama would emerge the winner. Barack Obama giving his victory speech after winning the election. Elements of the speech were included in the episode, broadcast less than 24 hours later. Parker felt strongly over the course of the election season that Obama would win the election, so much so that he bet money on his victory in October. Parker used a sports betting website, which he normally used to gamble on football games, to predict the outcome; the website placed the odds heavily against McCain. The team initially intended to create an alternate version in case McCain won, but found the prospect too daunting, considering their quick production schedule. In a possible scenario in which McCain was declared the winner, the duo intended to air the completed episode as is and deal with what was termed their \\"Dewey Defeats Truman\\" moment later. Possible outcomes included doing a drunken Mystery Science Theater 3000-esque commentary over the completed version, in which lines are poorly dubbed over the dialogue. Rather than partying in the streets, Obama supporters would be rioting, while McCain supporters would hide in the Ark to protect themselves from the riot, rather than a world in which their candidate loses. \\"There was a really stressful fifteen minutes there where we thought 'Oh man, what if we're wrong?' We really banked on it,\\" said Stone. In choosing which characters would be liberal or conservative, Stone admitted the choices were sometimes arbitrary. The character of Randy getting inebriated was always something the team found humorous; as a result, it was natural he become a hard-partying Obama supporter. In contrast, Mr. Garrison, who in the series is a \\"self-hating gay man\\", is portrayed as a McCain supporter to provide irony. In one possible storyline, then-President George W. Bush would heroically take the blame for the diamond heist, in a parody of The Dark Knight, but it was rejected as jokes about Bush had become overdone. The episode includes details such as excerpts from Obama's victory speech and the stage and podium on which he spoke. For the victory and concession speeches, Parker wrote placeholder lines until after the election's outcome. Following Obama's victory speech, the duo found it remarkable the amount of placeholder material that turned out similar to the actual speech. Comedy Central, as usual, saw few finished sequences before the episode went to air, but raised questions over one scene in which Obama's grandmother \\"fakes\\" her death (Obama's real grandmother had passed the day preceding the election). The episode was completed on the morning of its air date, hours after they typically complete episodes. \\"We're delivering it right up against the wire every single week. ... Trey and I got home at 10:30 yesterday morning,\\" said Stone to an interviewer the day following the episode's broadcast. Reception Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club commended the episode's apolitical approach, but wished \\"tonight's inconsequential silliness had been a little funnier across the board\\". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger criticized the episode as a \\"half-hour SNL sketch\\", commenting that only the first five minutes he felt were humorous. Newsweek criticized the episode as a \\"lukewarm parody\\" in a 2010 article criticizing the creative state of the program. \\"While this episode was perhaps not as funny as it could have been, it manages to feel poignant,\\" said Travis Fickett of IGN. \\"Trey Parker and Matt Stone have always turned around South Park episodes with impressive speed, but Wednesday night was ridiculous,\\" said James Hibberd of The Hollywood Reporter.

Hence it becomes imminent we tell their brilliant stories to the world and show their dance. In the wake of inadequate research and documentation, several myths and misconceptions shroud lives and history of courtesans. Today, it is not uncommon to have the words ‚Äòcourtesan‚Äô and ‚Äòprostitute‚Äô being used inter- changeably. This is the greatest error that has been continually done. In an extremely unfair record of history based on gender inequality, the men pursuing these arts are revered as \\"Ustads\\" (Masters) while the women pursuing the same arts became \\"Nautch Girls\\" (Dancing Girls). The current generations of erstwhile male court dancers talk about family lineage with a sense of pride extolling the greatness of their forefathers as dancers in royal courts. At the same time, the generations of women court dancers live with a sense of shame never disclosing their lineage or any connection with erstwhile courts. Gender discrimination in the field of arts has never been addressed and today this sect of women are ostracised in the society and considered \\"lesser\\" than their contemporary men. Manjari says, \\"It is the need of the hour to question and challenge the \\"disregard\\" towards these women artists and their traditions. We must think about this as a collective society and a project like this helps to shape up the collective conscience of the society.\\" See also * List of Kathak dancers References Category:Kathak exponents Category:Indian female classical dancers Category:Performers of Indian classical dance Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Dancers from Uttar Pradesh Category:Women artists from Uttar Pradesh Category:20th- century Indian dancers Category:20th-century Indian women artists ","title":"Manjari Chaturvedi"},{"id":"20051355","text":"Leigh Hobbs (born 18 April 1953) is an Australian artist and author. He is best known in Australia and the United Kingdom for the humorous children‚Äôs books which he has written and illustrated, although he has produced works across a wide range of mediums. His books principally feature the characters Old Tom, Horrible Harriet, Fiona the Pig, Mr Badger and Mr Chicken, and characters from the 4F for FREAKS books. He was the Australian Children's Laureate for 2016-17. Life and career The Old Tom with comb artwork is by Leigh Hobbs Leigh Hobbs was born in Williamstown in Victoria, Australia and grew up in the town of Bairnsdale. After graduating from Caulfield Institute of Technology art school (now Monash University) in 1973, he was employed as an artist at Sydney‚Äôs Luna Park, an amusement park located adjacent to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. While there he designed the colour scheme for the antique carousel, and created two large three-dimensional characters called Larry and Lizzy Luna, which now reside at Sydney‚Äôs Powerhouse Museum. Between 1978 and 2002 Hobbs supported his artistic career by working as a secondary school art teacher. In 1980 Hobbs held a one-man show of caricature sculptures at the Rex Irwin Gallery in Sydney. Between 1985 and 2010 he was a freelance contributing cartoonist for The Age newspaper in Melbourne, Victoria. Since 1999 time a number of major profiles of Hobbs and his work have been published. In 1983 Leigh Hobbs created a series of glazed ceramic tea pots in the shape of Melbourne's Flinders Street Station. These are in the collection of a number of galleries including the National Gallery of Victoria. In 1999 Hobbs designed the colour scheme for the entrance to Melbourne's Luna Park in St. Kilda. Between 1998 and 2002 a French/Australian co-produced animated cartoon TV series Old Tom was created based on his Old Tom books, and over 50 episodes were broadcast in Australia on ABC TV. In 2013 Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) adapted Hobbs‚Äô book Mr Chicken Goes To Paris for the stage and the book is a popular title in the Mus√©e du Louvre bookshop in Paris. Leigh Hobbs‚Äôs children's books are often described as working on a number of levels and could be seen as gently subversive. For example, Hobbs's most popular creation, Old Tom, is a grotesque one eyed cat, but the word cat is never used in the books. Old Tom's 'owner' a prim matron like character called Angela Throgmorton thinks of Old Tom as her 'son' and the stories revolve around her efforts to socialise this creature who is in fact like a seven-year-old boy trying to break free of a mothers constraints. Hobbs has frequently been shortlisted for the CBCA's Picture Book of the Year award, his books have won many of the major children's choice awards in Australia, and in 2010 Old Tom was short-listed for the Prime Minister's Literary Awards. In Australia his works are published by Allen & Unwin Leigh Hobbs's artwork, paintings, drawings, prints, illustrations and ceramics are to be found in numerous private collections, public art galleries, and institutions including the National Gallery of Victoria and the State Libraries of Victoria, and Western Australia.

It was founded in 1865, by Andrew Lee Brewer, and was previously a military school known as Saint Matthew's Hall or Saint Matthew's School. 19th century campus on Barroilhet Avenue __TOC__  Background  The school offers classes from pre-kindergarten to 8th grade. The school's pre-school program was terminated in 2019 after more than 50 years of continuous operation. The school is on a very small campus, a building completed in 1957, that was expanded in a major construction project that began in 2013 and was completed in 2015 and is shared with St. Matthew's Episcopal Church. The Pre-K class is in a separate building a block away. Lay teachers have been used since 1970. The tuition is around $30,000 per year. It is located at 16 Baldwin Avenue, San Mateo, California.  Enrollment  The school had K-8 enrollment of 269 students in the 2019 school year compared to 271 in the prior year. Maximum enrollment capacity is approximately 324 students. The day school has facilities for two classes per grade.  School history  = Founding as a Military School = Hawaiin princes David Kawananakoa, Edward Keliiahonui and Jonah Kuhio Kalaniana'ole in their cadet uniforms. The day school was founded in 1865 and was previously a military boarding school for boys known as Saint Matthew's Hall or Saint Matthew's School, established as an \\"English and Classical School for Boys\\". Military discipline was rigorously maintained - students were required to wear military style uniforms, marched between locations at the school and were awakened by bugle. Starting in 1872, military instructors of military academies were required to be commissioned Majors in the National Guard, ensuring that military schools maintained adequate discipline. In the early years of the military school, students, called cadets, were equipped with rifles and a cannon (a Parrott field gun) and conducted military field training. Approximately 3,000 young men graduated from Saint Matthew's Hall before its closure. The military school was prestigious, and graduation guaranteed acceptance to the University of California at Berkeley and Stanford. It was so successful that several similar military-style schools opened in the surrounding area. In the early 1890s, Reverend Brewer decided that the military school required more room and moved to Hillsborough, where it remained until it closure in 1915. David Kawananakoa, a nephew of Hawaiin King David Kawananakoa, attended the academy from 1883 to 1887. While studying there Kawananakoa, and his younger brothers, Edward Keliiahonui and Jonah Kuhio Kalaniana'ole, are credited with introducing surfing to the continental USA.Perry, Frank. Lighthouse Point: Illuminating Santa Cruz. Santa Cruz, Calif: Otter B Books, 2002, p.144-46. = St. Margaret's School for Girls = After the military school moved to Hillsborough, Reverend George Wallace reopened the buildings at the day school's current location on Baldwin Avenue as St. Margaret's School for girls, which continued operation until 1892. = Establishment of Current Day School = The current form of day school was founded in 1953 by the Sisters of the Community of the Transfiguration, an order of Episcopal nuns from Ohio under rector Lesley Wilder Jr. The day school initially included nursery and pre-nursery classes before adding additional classes to become a nursery through 8th grade school in 1963. The day school completed a $21 million building project in 2015 that increased its building space by 27,000 square feet, adding classroom space and allowing it to double its classes from one class per grade level to two. Although the school exists within the Episcopal Church, students are not required to ascribe to any religion, and only about 15% are Episcopalian.Sexual abuse crisis =Notable alumni= * Lincoln Steffens - later a celebrated writer, who was frequently disciplined by Brewer * David Kawananakoa - third in the line of in succession to the Hawaiin throne * Edward Keliiahonui - fourth in the line of in succession to the Hawaiin throne * Jonah Kuhio Kalaniana'ole - fifth in the line of in succession to the Hawaiin throne  Sexual Abuse Case  = Background = The day school experienced a child sexual abuse crisis when one of its pre-school teachers created hundreds of pornographic images and videos of day school students. The teacher targeted as many as 20 five to eight year old students. The illegal pictures and videos were taken during school hours in the pre-school and in the school's after-care program. The teacher acknowledged using the pictures for sexual gratification as part of a bondage fetish. The teacher pled guilty (no contest) to 5 felony charges and was sentenced to 6 years in prison. The case resulted in a number of claims and lawsuits filed against the day school, Head of School Julie Galles and St. Matthew's Episcopal Church and resulted in a great deal of negative publicity for the school. The California Department of Social Services also found that the day school committed licensing violations as a result of the incidents. = Efforts to Remove Judge = In addition to the very large number of children targeted, the case was notable because of the San Mateo District Attorney's efforts to remove the judge, Judge Donald Ayoob, from the case (as well as two other cases being heard by Judge Ayoob), because of perceptions that the judge was too lenient on sex abuse perpetrators and would not take the case seriously. Judge Ayoob had sentenced prior perpetrators to a year in county jail rather than state prison as requested by prosecutors including a perpetrator who possessed thousands of pornographic images and videos. Prosecutors did not file paperwork requesting the removal in time, and another judge refused to remove Ayoob. After the case of Brock Turner, who received a 6 month sentence for raping a Stanford University Student, generating such public outcry over the leniency of the sentence that the judge in the case was recalled and removed as a judge, the prosecutors' effort to remove the judge reflected prosecutors' determination to ensure that sexual abuse cases are taken seriously, but raised questions of whether prosecutors were trying to politicize cases or influence the outcome by generating a \\"mob mentality\\". Although the judge was not removed, the sentence of six years was significantly more severe than Judge Ayoob had given to other perpetrators, and the general perception was that the effort to have these cases taken seriously was, at least in this case, effective.  St. Matthew's Episcopal Church  The Episcopal Church of St. Matthew operates the day school. The church is part of the Diocese of California, located in San Francisco. On April 24, 1864, Giles Alexander Easton established an Episcopal church named for Saint Matthew on the historic mission trail known as El Camino Real. Services were held in a school until ground could be broken for a building. Two acres of land were donated by Agnes Poett Howard, widow of William Davis Merry Howard, and their son, William Henry Howard. In 1865 a stone church with capacity of about 200 people was built and a two-story school building known as Saint Mathew's Hall for the school. The nave was 48 feet (15 m) by 36 feet (11 m), and the chancel was 12 feet (3.7 m) by 24 feet (7.3 m). The street between the church and school was known as Saint Matthews Avenue. Alfred Lee Brewer (1831‚Äì1899) operated the school in English \\"public school\\" tradition with strict military discipline. The school campus became part of the city of Burlingame, California. Three Princes of the Kingdom of Hawaii, brothers Jonah K≈´hi≈ç Kalaniana ªole (1871‚Äì1922), David KawƒÅnanakoa (1868‚Äì1908) and Edward Abnel Keli ªiahonui (1869‚Äì1887) attended the school in the 1880s. It advertised itself as \\"the leading private educational institution for boys on the Pacific Coast\\" in 1889. It was later taken over by his son William Augustus Brewer (1863‚Äì1931). William Brewer became mayor of the new town of Hillsborough, California. By 1902 the school was called \\"the best known private educational institution upon the west coast.\\" Neptune Blood William Gallway became rector of the church in 1904. The buildings were damaged in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The old church was replaced by a new one designed by Willis Polk, with many furnishings salvaged from the original building. The new building was consecrated on May 15, 1910. The school was shut down in 1915 when a road was constructed through the campus. A new organ was donated in memory of William H. Crocker in 1938.

Public relations and products Palisades was notable for its close relationship and commonality with toy fans. The official message board served as one of the company's strongest communication platforms where President and CEO Mike Horn and other employees would directly discuss their products with consumers. In fact, polls were often held to let fans decide upcoming products, and news coverage of the company frequently stemmed from Palisades' forum discussion.

This offered exclusive figures and came in response to reports of difficulty in obtaining the Vanishing Cream Beaker figure. In terms of product quality, Palisades set high standards, particularly with its array of action figures.

Retrieved on 7-17-10. A few months later, Palisades obtained the hot license. The debut of this collection was culminated by the 2005 convention exclusive Super Grover with box art by Alex Ross. As one of the most highly anticipated figure lines at the time, the first series of Sesame Street was intended for a mid-2005 release but came to a stirring delay. In fact, two series of figures were planned, and many photos of the fully developed, packaged figure prototypes were released to the public. But the line would ultimately never come to fruition, according to Horn, due to lack of retailer support. This same problem haunted The Muppet Show and led to its cancellation that same year. Distribution Palisades products were sold throughout the world at various retail outlets including Toys R Us, KB Toys, Target, Electronics Boutique, Tower Records, Media Play, Sam Goody, Suncoast Video, and various comic shops. Due to the selectivity of the company's products, however, this range of retailers would eventually narrow to a select few and play a significant part in Palisades' floundering success. On August 1, 2005, Palisades began a partnership with Blister Direct that made them the exclusive distributor of Palisades merchandise in Japan.Cochran, Jay Palisades And Blister Partner For Exclusive Distribution Deal Toy News International (August 1, 2005).

A combination of these factors may have attributed to deep expense on behalf of the acclaimed toy company. =Micronauts dilemma= The biggest blow to Palisades, however, would be during the production of Micronauts, Series 1. The company initially was given the impression that it would have access to the original Micronauts molds and tooling which would reduce production effort. This would not be the case, however, and plans were scaled back as everything would have to be built from scratch.Fanmode interview: Bryan Wilkinson (part 3) Fanmode (2009). Retrieved on 7-17-10. Curiously, Takara would have no part in this Micronauts revival, so Palisades began seeking out vintage samples from fans to help its development. Throughout mid-late 2002, according to former Palisades toy designer Bryan Wilkinson, reports from China on the in-development line were positive. However, it would later be discovered that Ken Lilly, who was head of Palisades‚Äô product development, had been deceived by a company acting as Palisades' middleman responsible for subcontracting the factory. By this point, a significant percentage of the commission was paid to the middleman, and the other portion was to be paid after contract fulfillment. This middleman apparently had no intention of ever collecting the rest, and instead, kept most of the money while farming out the production to another facility to develop the toys for a fraction of the cost and with no quality control. The middleman never received the rest of its money and vanished when pursued by Palisades. With numerous errors and mispackaged and defective parts, employees were appalled at the result, but at this stage, financial losses on the part of Palisades would be inevitable. Not only was the Micronauts line affected, but other lines assigned to the factory at the time, such as part of the early The Muppet Show series, suffered though not as heavily. Adding to the strain was slow shipment due to the U.S. dock workers' union dispute and lockout in October 2002.Cappannari, Andrea and Azul, Rafael US shippers lock out dockworkers on West Coast World Socialist Web Site (September 30, 2002). Retrieved on 7-17-10. Already over-budget Palisades quickly addressed the poor quality but had few resorts and only one employee to handle it. The company could only replace badly damaged returned toys with other poor quality product which, according to Wilkinson, \\"might have been their worst mistake from a public relations point of view, as some felt that this indicated they were trying to still push and mark up known defective product.\\" Nevertheless, while financial recovery would be impossible, Palisades attempted to salvage their reputation and pride with a second Micronauts series, a retooled Series 1, and a special Series 1.5, working more closely with the manufacturers this time. However, the company lost even more money in doing so, and retailers lost interest. A third series was put in development as a last attempt at redemption but canceled. The Micronauts revival would result in \\"an albatross for Palisades, their biggest financial loss ever.\\"Fanmode interview: Bryan Wilkinson (part 4) Fanmode (2009). Retrieved on 7-17-10. =Cancellations and demise= Problems with Palisades became evident as early as mid-2005. A forum poll the prior year let fans choose a Muppet pack-in character or accessory. However, due to a growing retailer disinterest in the line, the winning item, which was a cow, would not be released. Later that year, The Muppet Show was canceled entirely, after which Ken Lilly had posted the tentative series 10 through 14 lineup on their message board. Four items of the series were released while all of the rest never passed the prototype or planning stages. These consisted of basic, Mega, and Mini figures, in addition to playsets such as the massive Muppet Theatre stage. In November, a press release by President Mike Horn detailed the long- standing delay on Palisades' hotly anticipated Sesame Street action figure line: :\\"There's not one person on the planet who wants this product line out more than me. It's been alluded to numerous times, but I'll say it here, on the record. The delays on this (and other) lines are directly related to the general lack of retail support. There's simply not enough orders to justify the massive production costs. That said, we are proceeding with production (and likely losing a ton of money in the process) so that we can try to get some momentum started and to satisfy collector desires.\\"Cochran, Jay Sesame Street Figures In Jeopardy!?!

Its industrial designation is WZ213. The Type 63A is being replaced by the ZTD-05 Amphibious Assault Tank. Development Before the mid-1990s, Chinese ground forces relied on the Type 63 amphibious light tank developed in the early 1960s. The low swimming-speed and weak firepower of the Type 63 was insufficient to the needs of modern maritime amphibious assault operations that PLA would conduct. The PLA demanded a replacement for the Type 63 in the early 1990s, which led to the development of the Type 63A in 1997. Reports indicate that over 300 examples has been delivered to the PLA by the end of 2000. The tank is also used by the Tanzanian armed forces. Design The Type 63A is a lightly armoured amphibious light tank with a flat, boat-like hull. Suspension is made up of 6 road wheels and lead or return rollers. A redesigned welded turret from the original Type 63 is mounted center of the hull, with the powerpack positioned in the rear. The Type 63A has 2 additional floating tanks to increase the stability of the vehicle in the water. There are 3 water inlets on both sides of the hull. In the rear of the hull there are to allow 2 large water jets for travelling in water. Type 63A introduces an enlarged welded turret replacing the original Type 63 turret, the modernised Type 63A utilises a two-axis stabilised 105 mm rifled gun replacing the 85 mm gun. The 105 mm rifled gun fires armour piercing fin stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS), high explosive (HE), and high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) ammunitions, with 45 rounds carried inside the vehicle. APFSDS round penetrates 400 mm steel armour or destroy a reinforced concrete bunker a distance of 2,000 m. To overcome the inaccuracy of firing when swimming, the Type 63A uses laser-beam guidance ATGM which is not affected by wave motion while swimming. The missile has a maximum firing range of 4‚Äì5 km with a first hit probability of +90% against stationary targets. Its secondary functions can engage low-flying helicopters. Performance The Type 63A enhance capability allows the vehicle to conduct amphibious operations from its host amphibious warfare ships at distances from 5‚Äì7 km to shore at a speed of 28 km/h.http://www.sinodefence.com/army/tank/type63.asp sinodefence: type63 Compared to the Type 63, the Type 63A featured five major improvements: The modernised Type 63 to Type 63A has given enhanced sea travelling performance, increased swimming speed, improved fire-control system, ATGM capability, and larger 105 mm rifled gun with dual stabilizers. System The FCS includes digital fire-control computer, integrated commander sight with laser rangefinder input, and white-light spotter or image-stabilised gunner's sight w/ passive night vision. The Type 63A night vision is an image intensifier system. Alternatively the gunner sight can be fitted with a thermal imager night vision. It is also equipped with the satellite positioning (GPS/GLONASS) system to allow accurate landing position in harsh weather conditions and night operations. It's also equipped with computerised fire-control to enable accurate firing both on land and at sea.

He was the brother of Harvey Fellows, who also played first-class cricket. Cricket player Walter Fellows was the seventh son of Thomas Fellows, of Moneyhill, Hertfordshire, and was educated at Westminster School and at Christ Church, Oxford. He was an all-rounder who was first noted as a schoolboy cricketer at Westminster.Altham, p.111. In first-class cricket, he was mainly associated with Oxford University and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). He played for several predominantly amateur teams including the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players series. He had a reputation as a \\"terrific and very successful hitter\\".Altham, p.115. Fellows' name has appeared in the \\"records\\" section of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack for many years under the heading \\"Record Hit\\" with the same wording: \\"The Rev. W. Fellows, while at practice on the Christ Church ground at Oxford in 1856, drove a ball bowled by Charles Rogers 175 yards from hit to pitch.\\"For example: A note reproduced in an Australian newspaper in 1890 states that Fellows at the time was 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighed 17 stones 4 pounds. Fellows made 24 known appearances in first-class matches from 1853 to 1857. He played in the University match for Oxford University against Cambridge University as a lower middle-order batsman and a bowler for four years from 1854 to 1857, making important batting contributions in 1854, 1856 and 1857 and having some limited success as a bowler in 1855 and 1856; he appeared in the Gentlemen v Players matches at Lord's from 1855 to 1857. Later career Fellows was ordained in 1858, and served as curate at Weedon and at Sidmouth, before he emigrated to Australia in 1863 to become the first vicar of St John's Church, Toorak. In Australia, he played for the Melbourne Cricket Club; a report in an Australian newspaper in 1878 indicates that Fellows was discouraged from playing in major matches by his bishop, Charles Perry, but that the retirement of Perry brought about a more permissive attitude from the new incumbent, James Moorhouse, and Fellows was able to resume. He resigned his position due to ill health in 1900, and died at Toorak parsonage near Melbourne on 23 July 1902. Family Fellows married, in 1862, Julia Packe, daughter of Rev. Christopher Packe, vicar of Ruislip.

Kashmir rugs or carpets have intricate designs that are primarily oriental, floral style in a range of colors, sizes and quality. The Kashmiri Rugs - Kashmiri( /ka ÉÀàm…™…ôri/ ) word denotes a native or inhabitant of Kashmir. It also refers to the language of Kashmir. Rug ( /r å…°/ ) word is recognised with the floor covering of thick woven material (\\"an oriental rug\\"). Kashmir carpets are handmade, hand- knotted, and are primarily made using pure wool, pure silk and occasionally wool and silk blends. These are available in wide-ranging colors, designs and sizes. Kashmir rugs are primarily made in the vicinity of Srinagar, Kashmir in North India and neighboring villages in rural parts of Kashmir. Kashmir rugs are one of the most sought-after artworks by connoisseurs around the world owing to their exceptional workmanship. Kashmir rugs are available in a range of standard sizes, such as 3'x2', 4'x2'6\\", 5'x3', 6'x4', 7'x5', 10'x8', 12'x9', 14'x10', 15'x12' and 18'x12'. Larger sizes than these dimensions are mostly custom-made. Kashmir rugs are renowned to have bright, jewel-like color tones such as sapphire blue, ruby red, emerald green, aquamarine, amethyst, and ivory. Rugs from Kashmir are traditionally made in oriental, floral designs that typically involve significant and culturally important motifs such as the paisley, chinar tree, (the oriental plane) and tree-of-life. Most of these designs are rooted in the Kashmiri way of life and are a symbolic representation of the age-old Kashmir tradition of hospitality, warmth, and love. It is often said in Kashmir folklore that a home is incomplete without a soul - a Kashmir carpet. The ethos of Kashmir culture is often represented in the motifs of a Kashmir rug. Although, the art of making these gorgeous rugs is not native to Kashmir and was first introduced nearly 400 years back by the Mughal rulers in India. Yet the indigenous brilliance of the local crafts- persons has made Kashmir carpets one of the most sought after works of art in the world. Rugs of Kashmir have always found more appeal due to their quaint designs and an interesting blend of classic colors inspired by the cultural microcosm of Kashmir and at times the colors were contemporary in nature that made carpets of Kashmir widely popular across North America, South Asia and Europe.

The glass is then used as a medium for recording pen traces in scientific instruments. The advantages of using the glass are that the recording medium is easily renewable (just re- smoke the glass), and that the trace obtained can easily be magnified by projection onto a suitable surface. A variation on this scheme is the use of smoked paper in early seismographs. The effect of smoked glass can be incorporated into glass manufacture by adding darkening materials, such that light passing through the glass is decreased in brightness. It can be used aesthetically, for example, in the manufacture of coffee tables with smoked glass tops. It can also be used in scientific instruments as a filter, as in the use of smoked glass in cross-staves and sextants, allowing operators to make sun sightings without damaging their eyesight.

Released on November 27, 2006, through Nonesuch Records, the album is a collaboration between contemporary classical composer and frequent Aronofsky collaborator Clint Mansell, classical string quartet the Kronos Quartet, and post-rock band Mogwai. The score received mixed reviews from critics and was nominated for several awards. Recording Clint Mansell‚Äîthe composer for Aronofsky's previous films Pi and Requiem for a Dream‚Äîreprised his role for The Fountain. The San Francisco-based string quartet Kronos Quartet‚Äîwho previously performed for the Requiem for a Dream soundtrack‚Äîand Scottish post-rock band Mogwai also contributed to the film score. Darren Aronofsky hoped that David Bowie‚Äîwhose song \\"Space Oddity\\" helped influence the film's space traveler storyline‚Äîwould record a song when the musical artist worked briefly with composer Clint Mansell during production. Aronofsky planned for Bowie to rework pieces of the score and to vocalize them, but the plan was unsuccessful. After the score was completed, Nonesuch Records, the home of The Fountain musical contributor Kronos Quartet, released the soundtrack on November 21, 2006. Mansell researched possible scores to compose one tying together the three storylines. He sought to have an organic feeling to the score and explored implementing orchestral and electronic elements that would have \\"a real human element to them that breathes\\". Contrary to most films' scores composed in post- production, Mansell's score was composed concurrently with the film's production; he created a mood that flourished as the film progressed. The composer described the parallel process, \\"It's instinct and listening to what the film is telling you it needs\\". Mansell drew from five to six years of writing material for The Fountain. The composer planned for the score to be pure percussion when the film was first meant to be epic in scale. Mansell, lacking classical training, collaborated with an assistant in creating the score. They deconstructed the composer's initial pieces for The Fountain and re-played them in a key so the lead melodies could harmonically play with every progression. The song \\"Together We Will Live Forever\\" was an electronic piece designed by Mansell to be the protagonist's memory theme. Antony Hegarty, lead singer of Antony and the Johnsons, was commissioned to create a vocal piece over \\"Together We Will Live Forever\\" for the end credits, but the director decided that the vocals would not be appropriate to end the film. The song was ultimately performed by pianist Randy Kerber. Marketing and reception The content and research agency Ramp Industry launched The Fountain Remixed, an official website driven by user-generated content. Users could download freely provided audio parts from The Fountain's film score, remix the music, and upload the work onto the website to be evaluated by other users. Mansell won the Chicago Film Critics Association's 2006 award for Best Original Score, and he also won the World Soundtrack Award for Best Original Soundtrack of the Year and Public Choice Award. He was also nominated for the 2006 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for The Fountain, but lost to Alexandre Desplat for The Painted Veil. Mansell also lost a nomination for the 2006 BFCA Critics' Choice Award for Best Composer to Philip Glass for The Illusionist.

The current sultan is Al-Sultan Abdullah ibni Sultan Ahmad Shah. He is the Head of Islam in the state and the source of all titles, honours and dignities in the state. Historically, the title was also used by rulers of the Old Pahang Sultanate. History The Old Pahang Kingdom appeared in foreign records from as early as 5th century and at its height, covered much of the modern state of Pahang and the entire southerly part of the peninsula. Throughout its pre-Melakan history, Pahang was established as a mueang or naksat of some major regional Malayic mandalas including Langkasuka, Srivijaya and Ligor. Around the middle of the 15th century, it was brought into the orbit of Melaka Sultanate and subsequently established as a vassal Muslim Sultanate in 1470, following the coronation of the grandson of the former Maharaja as the first Sultan of Pahang. Over the years, Pahang grew independent from Melakan control and at one point even established itself as a rival state to Melaka until the latter's demise in 1511. At the height of its influence, the Sultanate was an important power in Southeast Asian history and controlled the entire Pahang basin, bordering to the north, the Pattani Sultanate, and adjoins to that of Johor Sultanate to the south. To the west, it also extends jurisdiction over part of modern-day Selangor and Negeri Sembilan.. During this period, Pahang was heavily involved in attempts to rid the Peninsula of the various foreign imperial powers; Portugal, Holland and Aceh. After a period of Acehnese raids in the early 17th century, Pahang entered into the amalgamation with the successor of Melaka, Johor, when its 14th Sultan, Abdul Jalil Shah III, was also crowned the 7th Sultan of Johor. After a period of union with Johor, it was eventually revived as a modern sovereign Sultanate in the late 19th century by the Bendahara dynasty. After a period of union with Johor, the autonomous Pahang Kingdom came into existence with the consolidation of power by the Bendahara family, following the gradual dismemberment of Johor Empire. A self rule was established in Pahang in the late 18th century, with Tun Abdul Majid declared as the first Raja Bendahara. The area around Pahang formed a part of the hereditary domains attached to this title and administered directly by the Raja Bendahara. The weakening of the Johor sultanate and the disputed succession to the throne was matched by an increasing independence of the great territorial magnates; the Bendahara in Pahang, the Temenggong in Johor and Singapore, and the Yamtuan Muda in Riau. In 1853, the fourth Raja Bendahara Tun Ali, renounced his allegiance to the Sultan of Johor and became independent ruler of Pahang. He was able to maintain peace and stability during his reign, but his death in 1857 precipitated civil war between his sons. The younger son Wan Ahmad challenged the succession of his half-brother Tun Mutahir, in a dispute that escalated into a civil war. Supported by the neighbouring Terengganu Sultanate and the Siamese, Wan Ahmad emerged victorious, establishing controls over important towns and expelled his brother in 1863. He served as the last Raja Bendahara, and was proclaimed Sultan of Pahang by his chiefs in 1881.

Installed as Abdul Jalil Riayat Shah III, he reigned until 1677. With the decline of Aceh, Johor-Pahang gradually extend its suzerainty over the Riau-Lingga islands. #1623‚Äì1677: Abdul Jalil Shah III #*1641‚Äì1676: Yamtuan Muda Raja Bajau ‚Äì heir apparent to the Johor throne who ruled Pahang as separate dominion until his death in 1676. #1677‚Äì1685: Ibrahim Shah #1685‚Äì1699: Mahmud Shah II =House of Bendahara= Sultan of Johor- Pahang-Riau-Lingga (Johor Empire) When Mahmud Shah II died in 1699, Bendahara Tun Abdul Jalil became Sultan of Johor-Pahang-Riau-Lingga and assumed the title Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah IV. His appointment was accepted by Johor chiefs based on an understanding that the Bendahara would succeed to the throne if the Sultan died without heirs. #1699‚Äì1720: Abdul Jalil Shah IV (Bendahara Tun Abdul Jalil) #1722‚Äì1760: Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah #1760‚Äì1761: Abdul Jalil Muazzam Shah #1761-1761: Ahmad Riayat Shah #1761‚Äì1770: Mahmud Shah III Raja Bendahara of Pahang By the early 19th century, the Johor- Pahang-Riau-Lingga empire had begun to break up. After 1806, the empire's constituent parts effectively became principalities, and the cultural unity that had hitherto existed between the Malay Peninsula and the islands of Riau- Lingga was gradually destroyed. The signing of Anglo-Dutch Treaty in 1824 further undermined the cohesion of the Johor-Pahang-Riau-Lingga empire and contributed to the emergence of Pahang and Johor as independent states. The Treaty confirmed, among other things, that the islands south of Singapore, including Java and Sumatra, were to remain the preserve of the Dutch, while the Peninsula would be within the British sphere of influence. The Malay Rulers were not consulted about the Treaty, and the Johor-Pahang-Riau-Lingga empire became irrevocably divided when a succession dispute gave rise to two centres of power, one in Riau-Lingga (under Abdul Rahman Muazzam Shah, r. 1812‚Äì1832) and the other in Johor (under Hussein Shah, r.1819‚Äì1835). From here, the Raja Bendahara of Pahang grew increasingly independent. While Bendahara Tun Ali had acknowledged Abdul Rahman as his overlord, the Anglo- Dutch Treaty confined the Sultan to Riau-Lingga, where he was deemed a vassal of the Dutch, and prevented him from exercising his control over the Malay Peninsula, which had come under the British. Bendahara Tun Ali declared his autonomy from the empire by 1853. He was able to maintain peace and stability during his reign, but his death in 1858 precipitated civil war among his sons, Tun Mutahir and Tun Ahmad, the result of which the formation of modern Pahang Sultanate. #1770‚Äì1802: Tun Abdul Majid #1802‚Äì1803: Tun Muhammad #1803‚Äì1806: Tun Koris #1806‚Äì1858: Tun Ali #1858‚Äì1863: Tun Mutahir #1863‚Äì1881: Tun Ahmad later proclaimed as SultanHistory of the Sultanate of Pahang , National Archives, mdpekan.gov.my Sultan of Modern Pahang #1881‚Äì1914: Ahmad al- Mu‚Äôazzam Shah #1914‚Äì1917: Mahmud Shah #1917‚Äì1932: Abdullah al-Mu‚Äôtassim Billah Shah #1932‚Äì1974: Abu Bakar Ri‚Äôayatuddin al-Mu‚Äôazzam Shah #1974‚Äì2019: Ahmad Shah Al-Musta‚Äôin Billah.

Their music is dance-friendly and often melodic, with frequent contributions by external vocalists. Like most Mongolian bands, they like to include elements of traditional Mongolian music in their songs. The creation of the band was inspired by a person named Jason who worked as an English teacher in Mongolia in 1996 and 1997. Besides giving language lessons, he also introduced his students to hip-Hop music. Five of them then came together to form Lumino, but a few years after the formation of the band two of their members, Chinzo and H√ºlg√º√º, stopped performing with the band. At one point Lumino consisted of more than a dozen members, headed by Skitzo, including the main MCs Skitzo, MC, Chinzo, and Lizard and MCs from the groups Old School and Skitzo's Free Style. Around 1999 the group went through a major restructuring and changed their strategy in terms of songs they were producing. They also cut their members to five. Previously known for their hardcore rap, Lumino also started to make softer songs for mainstream audiences, and the head of the band was replaced by MC. A number of songs such as Zam and H√ºniih were made into video clips and repeatedly played on TV, while the video for Namaig dagaad tseng was censored because of its too explicit imagery.

Thus, Kimberly is trapped inside the frail physical body of an elderly woman. She meets another misfit (a teenage boy) and the two form an attachment to one another that borders on attraction. The situation is not helped by Kimberly's rapidly deteriorating health. Soon Kimberly's family gets mixed up in some crazy money schemes, and the family gets emotionally destroyed. Plot ;Act 1 The lights go up on Kimberly sitting and waiting for her father, who is late picking her up because of his drinking. He compensates by agreeing to take her to a burger joint for some food, where they meet Jeff, the nerdy kid behind the window, who asks if Kim can do an interview for his project. Buddy strongly refuses and drives away. The scene changes to Pattie, Kimberly's mom, talking to a sound recorder to her unborn child about her life and how she believes she's a 'good mother'. Later on, Kimberly calls Jeff and agrees to meet at the library later for the interview, as he is learning about progeria. Characters * Kimberly, a teenage girl with an aging disease who struggles to find happiness in a chaotic family where nobody understands her * Buddy, her father, an alcoholic (becomes sober midway through the show) who only wants what's best for Kim * Jeff, a nerdy boy who is basically Kimberly's love interest, who is neglected by his father at home * Pattie, Kimberly's mother who thinks she is dying and is pregnant with her second child * Debra, Pattie's sister who causes the family some problems and lives with them on and off Productions The play was initially produced at the South Coast Repertory, Costa Mesa, California, from April 13 to May 13, 2001.

Released posthumously on January 23, 2009 as Official Release #85, it compiles the releases Lumpy Gravy and We're Only in It for the Money with previously unreleased material, with the overall package serving as an audio documentary of the production of the two albums, which share conceptual continuity themes. It is project/object #2 in a series of 40th Anniversary FZ Audio Documentaries, following MOFO (2006).  Content  The first disc consists of the 1967 version of Lumpy Gravy, intended for release by Capitol Records (actually a few 4-track cartridge copies of the Capitol version were distributed to wholesalers and radio stations before MGM Records, Zappa's label at the time, forced Capitol to halt distribution of their version of the album), and the 1968 mono mix of We're Only in It for the Money. The second disc consists of two remixes prepared by Zappa in 1984, with overdubs by drummer Chad Wackerman and bassist Arthur Barrow. The Lumpy Gravy remix derives from the 1968 edit; this third version of the album had not been released in full; an excerpt appeared in a sampler for The Old Masters box set. The second remix, of We're Only in It for the Money had previously been released on compact disc in 1986.

He was president of the National Brewing Company from 1946 to 1973. He was also part-owner of the Baltimore Orioles of the American League from 1954 to 1965, and majority owner from 1965 to 1979. Biography Hoffberger was a lifelong resident of Baltimore, Maryland, and was Jewish. He was the only son of his father Samuel, a lawyer who was active in the Democratic Party and a major shareholder and board chairman of National Brewing. His grandfather Charles had been a local merchant who sold wood, coal and ice. Hoffberger attended the University of Virginia. During World War II, he served in the United States Army with the 1st Armored Division in Africa, France and Italy, where he was wounded near Lake Bracciano, northwest of Rome. Jerold Hoffberger was also involved in the Battle of Monte Cassino. =Business career= The year after the war ended, he was appointed president of the brewery by his father after the death of his predecessor, Arthur Deute. Under the younger Hoffberger's command, National's sales rose from 230,000 barrels in 1946 to two million in 1966. Baltimore Orioles In 1953, when the St. Louis Browns of baseball's American League wanted to move to Baltimore, the nearby Washington Senators, led by Clark Griffith, objected to the potential encroachment on their market. Hoffberger helped ease the way for the move by making his National Bohemian beer a Senators sponsor. When Browns owner Bill Veeck was all but forced to sell the team, Hoffberger and attorney Clarence Miles put together a syndicate that bought the team for $2.5 million and moved it to Baltimore as the Orioles. Hoffberger was the largest single shareholder in the Orioles, but was initially a silent partner with Miles (1954‚Äì1955), James Keelty (1955‚Äì1960) and Joe Iglehart (1960‚Äì1965). During this time, however, he bought more and more stock until he acquired controlling interest in 1965. He immediately brought in Frank Cashen, National's advertising director, as executive vice president. Under the direction of Cashen and general manager Harry Dalton, the Orioles won four AL pennants and two World Series from 1966 to 1971. Even though the Orioles were a success on the diamond, the team struggled financially because of lagging attendance.Sehlstedt, Albert & Alvarez, Rafael. \\"Jerold C.

Negotiations ended when the National and Carling Brewing Companies agreed to a merger on October 14, 1975. A result of the consolidation was Hoffberger becoming chairman and chief executive officer of the newly formed Carling National Breweries, Inc. He retained ownership of the Orioles which wasn't included in the transaction, but couldn't sell it without company approval.Ferrante, Angela. \\"Labatt‚Äôs 1, Carling no score,\\" Maclean's, May 17, 1976.

He had arranged the only other competing bid which was fronted by Atlantic Packaging Company chairman of the board Phil Granovsky and had the potential financial support from Carling's advertising money, but the attempt wasn't successful due to the Labatt's group having nearly purchased the San Francisco Giants with the intention of transferring it to Toronto.

The first words out of his mouth were: 'How are you? How's your family?

Hoffberger was known for his charitable contributions, which included assistance to Johns Hopkins Hospital, the University of Maryland and Goucher College. Town & Country magazine estimated in 1983 that he had donated more than $10 million to charities. in the early 1970s, Hoffberger purchased a farm near Woodbine called Sunset Hill Farm (formerly Helmore Farm) in Howard County, Maryland where he bred Thoroughbred horses for racing. While primarily a breeder, he did race horses on his own, notably winning the 1984 Razorback Handicap at Oaklawn Park Race Track.

Shorty after Great Britain secured (then British Guiana) from the Dutch, waves of migrants were encouraged to move and settle the new expansive area. Barbados was one such location where large numbers of migrants came from. Through time Barbados and Guyana have both supported each other.

Her practise as an artist is usually associated with new geometry, post-geometry and postmodern. Life and work Bal√°≈æov√° studied at the Academy of Muse Arts, Bratislava and Magister of Arts degree received in 1984. Bal√°≈æov√° is also known as a teacher at the University of Trnava - since 1997. Husband - Bla≈æej Bal√°≈æ, slovak painter. Immediately at the beginning, M√°ria Bal√°≈æov√°, created her own ‚Äûpersonal mythology‚Äú, emphasizing a snake motif in the geometrically stylised form of a cobra. This animal, which occupies an important position in world mythologies and religions, became the main motif of cycles of paintings, to which the artist gave the name Serpent Geometry. Bal√°≈æov√° distinguished herself from classic Neo-Constructivism, outlined on subjectless combinations of shapes and colours, put together into geometric structures. Art theorists appreciate the ‚Äûnew significance‚Äú she achieved by creating radically reductive forms (Ji≈ô√≠ Valoch, 2002). \\"BELOHRADSKA, L. M√°ria Bal√°≈æov√°. In BELOHRADSK√Å, ƒΩ. ‚Äì TROJANOV√Å, E. 2009. Borders of Geometry. Bratislava : PETUM, p. 82 (English ‚Äì Slovak, colour).\\" In her latest works, fear of violence, power and hegemony are projected in the intimate family background, where the dominant men¬¥s element is systematically planned in the painting area and it culminates in the series of drawings and paintings called Domestic Violence. A distinctly expressive handwriting used in some places refers very straightforwardly to Bal√°≈æov√°¬¥s personal story and moves the general criticism of an androcentric society to a more intimate position. Here, the key role is played by the figure of a despotic father who permanently and demonically comes back in acrylic canvases and large-format drawings ‚Äì destructively and aggressively . In the latest works, M√°ria Bal√°≈æov√° bet on a straightforward expression of her personal story associated with a therapeutic character. This approach in her works represents a new dimension not only for her herself, but also for geometric painting in general. (Roman Gajdo≈°) Her works are held in the collections of Slovak National Gallery, Bratislava, National Gallery, Prague (CZ), Wannieck Gallery Brno (CZ), Jan Koniarek Gallery , Trnava. The artist has been a member of the revived Club of Concrete Artists 2 and the artist's group East of Eden. She lives and works in Trnava.

The Titan I and Titan II missiles were operational between 1962 and 1987 during the Cold War. These missiles, particularly the Titan II, were the basis of the Titan family of space launch vehicles. Titan was originally built as a backup to the SM-65 Atlas. The Titan I used RP-1 and liquid oxygen propellants and required around fifteen minutes to load the rocket and raise it to a launch position. The more powerful Titan II used nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine, allowing it to be stored with propellant loaded, giving it a much shorter response time. Titan I The launch of a Titan I missile The Titan I was the first version of the Titan family of rockets. It began as a backup ICBM project in case the Atlas was delayed. It was a two-stage rocket propelled by RP-1 and liquid oxygen. Using RP-1 and LOX meant that the Titan I did not have a quick launch sequence. It took about fifteen minutes to load LOX on the first missile at a complex, raise it topside and launch it, with two other missiles following at about eight-minute intervals. Titan I was operational from early 1962 to mid-1965. Several US Air Force units operated the Titan I: * 568th Strategic Missile Squadron, Larson AFB, Moses Lake, Washington * 569th Strategic Missile Squadron, Mountain Home AFB, Mt Home, Idaho * 851st Strategic Missile Squadron, Beale AFB, Marysville, California * 850th Strategic Missile Squadron, Ellsworth AFB, Rapid City, South Dakota * 451st Strategic Missile Wing (formerly 703rd) Lowry AFB, Denver, Colorado Titan II A Titan II emerges from its silo during launch Most Titan rockets were the Titan II, which could carry a W-53 nuclear warhead with a nine megaton yield, making it the most powerful ICBM on-standby in the US nuclear arsenal. These were deployed in three squadrons of 18 missiles each, in Arizona, Kansas, and Arkansas. All of the ICBM Titan II missile sites have been decommissioned since the retirement of the Titan II as an ICBM in 1987, but the Titan Missile Museum on Interstate 19 south of Tucson, Arizona, has preserved one deactivated launch site. The Titan II was a two-stage ICBM that was used by the US Air Force from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s. The Titan II used a hypergolic combination of nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine for propellant. In addition to its use as an ICBM, twelve Titan II missiles were converted to launch Gemini spacecraft for NASA, ten of which were manned. Following retirement, a further thirteen were converted to the Titan 23G configuration, and used to launch satellites, and the Clementine Lunar probe. The last Titan II launch occurred in 2003.

The Redstone family of rockets consisted of a number of American ballistic missiles, sounding rockets and expendable launch vehicles operational during the 1950s and 1960s. The first member of the Redstone family was the PGM-11 Redstone missile, from which all subsequent variations of the Redstone were derived. The Juno 1 version of the Redstone launched Explorer 1, the first U.S. orbital satellite in 1958 and the Mercury-Redstone variation carried the first two U.S. astronauts into space in 1961. PGM-11 Redstone First launched in 1953, the PGM-11 Redstone was a short-range surface-to-surface ballistic missile in active service with the U.S. Army from June 1958 to June 1964; and was used for the first U.S. live nuclear missile tests. It was built by Chrysler for the United States Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) and was deployed in West Germany. George Huebner was the executive engineer in charge of Chrysler's Missile Branch. Jupiter-A Jupiter-A was the first variant of Redstone, used to test components later used in the PGM-19 Jupiter medium- range ballistic missile. Jupiter-C Jupiter-C was a sounding rocket used for three sub-orbital spaceflights in 1956 and 1957. It was used as a testbed for re-entry vehicles later deployed on the PGM-19 Jupiter. Juno I Juno I was a derivative of the Jupiter-C, used to launch the first American satellite, Explorer 1, on January 31, 1958. Although the U.S. possibly could have put a satellite into orbit before the Soviet Union had the ABMA been allowed to attempt a satellite launch in August 1956, the Eisenhower administration wanted the first U.S. satellite to be launched by a civilian rocket developed by American engineers instead of a rocket derived from a military missile program and developed by the German engineers of Operation Paperclip. Additionally, the administration saw value in the USSR taking the first move to reach orbit because they would set the precedent that territorial overflight in space was fair game, necessary for the United States' space-based photoreconaissance ambitions in the wake of diplomatic protests against U-2 incursions of Soviet airspace. The Vanguard launch vehicle was the civilian rocket program in development for this purpose, so the administration ordered ABMA's research director, Wernher von Braun, not to attempt any satellite launches. The Vanguard rocket failed on its first attempt to launch the Vanguard satellite in December 1957, crashing back to the pad and exploding. Following this setback and in the wake of the Sputnik crisis, the administration changed course and turned to the Army, asking ABMA and von Braun to launch the JPL-built satellite as soon as possible. Mercury-Redstone The Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle (MRLV), also known as Mercury-Redstone, used the stretched Redstone configuration from the Jupiter-C for six suborbital launches for Project Mercury in 1960 and 1961, including America's first two human spaceflights: * Mercury-Redstone 1, abort, traveled * Mercury-Redstone 1A, successful unmanned flight * Mercury-Redstone 2, carried Ham the chimpanzee * Mercury-Redstone BD, booster development - final test before manned flight * Mercury-Redstone 3 (Freedom 7), first American in space, Alan Shepard * Mercury-Redstone 4 (Liberty Bell 7), second American in space, Gus Grissom Saturn Two members of the Saturn family of rockets, the Saturn I and IB, were derived from the Redstone. They used eight Redstone tanks clustered around one Jupiter propellant tank, and utilized eight Rocketdyne H-1 (Jupiter) engines to form the first stage of the rockets. First developed by the ABMA, the Saturn rocket was adopted by NASA for its Apollo program. America's first heavy-lift launch vehicles, the first of these was launched in 1961. Sparta Sparta was the name given to a series of surplus Redstone missiles with two solid-fuel upper stages launched as part of a joint US-UK research project with Australia from 1966‚Äì67. Sparta launched Australia's first Earth satellite, WRESAT.

Of the handful of the present-day Riototars (Reotutars), most reside in the city of Vigan and in the towns of Santa Catalina and San Vicente in the province of Ilocos Sur.  Introductory facts *Etymology = Combination of the Spanish word ‚Äòrio‚Äô (river), and ‚Äòtotar‚Äô (origin unknown, but possibly a localization of the Spanish word ‚Äòtopar‚Äô or ‚Äòto run into, to meet‚Äô) * Use = as surname/family name * Place of Origin = Luzon, Philippines * Variations = Riotutar, Reotutar, Retutar, Reototar.  Historical origin On 12 June 1572, the Spaniards, under the command of Captain Juan de Salcedo, arrived in what is now the modern-day city of Vigan. At the time, Vigan was virtually an island, ‚Äòdetached‚Äô from the Ilocos Mainland by the Abra, Mestizo and Govantes rivers, and their various tributaries and sub-tributaries. One of the sub-tributaries of the Abra River was called ‚ÄòRio Totar‚Äô, as per local oral tradition. Rio Totar is also used to describe the early settlement at the banks of the said tributary. However, the exact location of this ‚ÄòRio Totar‚Äô at present is not known, as the drastic changes in Abra River‚Äôs course over the centuries has caused the original course of the river to shift and most of its tributaries to vanish. Rio Totar is thus considered a lost toponym and cannot be found in modern-day maps. However, local tradition places the location of the original Rio Totar to the North of the present-day Govantes River (which course has also changed). The barrios of Cabaroan, Pangada, and Cabuloan of Sta. Catalina town are situated in this fabled site. Incidentally, the aforementioned barrios have at present a fair number of inhabitants surnamed ‚ÄòReotutar.‚Äô On 21 November 1849, Governor General Narciso Claver√≠a ordered a systematic distribution of family names for the native Filipinos to use. This was brought about mainly by the fact that Filipinos at that time did not use surnames or family names. Thus, the Catalogo Alfabetico de Apellidos was issued, containing at least 70,000 approved names to be assigned to families in all Philippine towns. Name distribution was systematic, in that every town was ‚Äòassigned‚Äô a particular letter in the alphabet, and all inhabitants thereof were compelled to adopt surnames beginning with that letter. Santa Catalina town was assigned the letter ‚ÄúR‚Äù, hence the inhabitants thereof had to assume ‚ÄúR‚Äù surnames in the Catalogo, such as Ragasa, Rapisura, Rafanan, Real, and Refuerzo. Some of the families living in the 'Rio Totar' settlement, however, wished to adopt ‚ÄúRio Totar‚Äù or ‚ÄúRiototar‚Äù as their surnames. This posed a problem as ‚ÄúRiototar‚Äù was not listed as an acceptable surname in the Catalogo. The predicament was remedied when the people were allowed by the local government, through the intercession of the parish priest, to register under that name. Variations Much to their chagrin, many ‚ÄòRiototars‚Äô discovered that they were registered either as ‚ÄòReotutar‚Äô or ‚ÄòRiotutar‚Äô. The misspelling, which was brought about by the utter lack of systematized record-keeping at that time, remained uncorrected. Hence, most modern-day descendants of the original ‚ÄòRiototars‚Äô are actually surnamed ‚ÄòReotutar‚Äô or ‚ÄòRiotutar‚Äô. The confusion brought about by the introduction of the new lexicographic variants and the difficulty of spelling and pronouncing the surname, coupled by the migration of some ‚ÄòRiototars‚Äô to other parts of the country, resulted in the many variations of the name that exist today. However, the surnames ‚ÄòRiotutar‚Äô, ‚ÄòReotutar‚Äô, ‚ÄòRetutar‚Äô and even ‚ÄòRetuta‚Äô, are still very much traceable to the original surname ‚ÄòRiototar‚Äô. All these surnames mean People of the Fabled Tributary of Rio Totar.

Case In Davie v Magistrates of Edinburgh, an expert witness gave evidence concerning the effect of shock waves in blasting operations and referred to a specific section of a pamphlet that allegedly supported his opinion. The Court of Session disproved of the Lord Ordinary's action of adopting other parts of the pamphlet that the expert had not made reference to. :\\" The Court cannot...rely upon such works for the purpose of displacing or criticising the witness's testimony.\\" - at 41. Law Lord President Cooper stated that \\"their duty is to furnish the judge or jury with the necessary scientific criteria for testing the accuracy of their conclusions, so as to enable the Judge or jury to form their own independent judgment by the application of these criteria to the facts proved in evidence.\\" Therefore, an expert witness should only offer their opinion as to the facts that have already been established in court, and \\"should not hinder the trier of fact's duty by telling them how to assess the evidence that they have heard\\". The weight to be given to the evidence provided by the expert witness is a matter for the judge (in civil, or summary criminal proceedings) or jury (in solemn criminal proceedings) alone. The court also stated that \\"expert witnesses are only required in order that certain facts can be assessed and understood in their specialist/scientific context\\". Moreover, in this case it was held that \\"in some situations, the scientific knowledge that an expert witness claims to have must be proved in court\\", such as in \\"Hewat v Edinburgh Corporation\\" 1974 S.C. 30. This is to prevent false claims of credentials that may affect the reliability of the opinion advanced by the expert witness. As a result of this case, only the extracts of any literature relied upon by an expert witness whilst giving their testimony may be used against them to challenge their opinion. The remainder of any texts/journals is not admissible and thus cannot be relied upon by the expert or any other party to the proceedings.
