With History The house was constructed in 1853 for William Cozzens, a horticulturalist from New England, who made his way to California via Panama. Mr. Cozzens couldn't pay the builder and lost the house in court that same year. J. Neely Johnson, fourth Governor of California who served from 1856 until 1858, lived in the home prior to his term as governor. A press report in 1856 noted that Johnson gave a brief speech from the balcony prior to being escorted to the State Capitol for his inauguration. Johnson was a lawyer by trade who moved to California during the 1849 California Gold Rush. Selden A. McMeans, State Tresurer of California elected in 1853, purchased the home in 1854 and later sold it in January 1856 to David S. Terry, California Supreme Court Justice. Terry resided there during the time of his infamous duel with Senator David Broderick who was shot by Terry and died three days later.

Many celebrities from the 1930s are featured. This is the first cartoon where Donald Duck is featured in his blue sailor hat. Plot Donald Duck tries to enter a Hollywood studio so he can search for celebrities willing to sign their autograph. A security guard with an Irish accent at the gate prevents him from entering the building. Donald manages to sneak inside by climbing on the limousine with Greta Garbo so that it seems he's riding along with her. The guard discovers he's been fooled and chases Donald, who enters a room with the name \\"Mickey Rooney\\" on it. Inside, Mickey Rooney is dressing up in front of the mirror, when Donald asks him for his autograph. Rooney writes his name in Donald's book and makes it disappear and reappear with a magic trick. Donald, who is not amused, tries to impress Rooney by doing a similar trick with an egg. The egg is however obviously hidden under Donald's hat and Rooney who is aware of this, crushes it, laughing loudly. Donald gets extremely angry and starts waving his fists, while Rooney manages to put a violin in Donald's hands and starts dancing an Irish jig Donald is playing. When Donald discovers he has been tricked for the third time he throws the violin at Rooney. Rooney ducks and the instrument lands in the face of the security guard. Alarmed, Donald runs away and hides under a bell-jar carried by actor Henry Armetta. When the guard discovers Donald's hiding place the duck runs to another film set full with ice. There he meets Sonja Henie and asks her for an autograph. Henie signs her name by skating it in the ice, so that Donald has to carry it with him. While walking in a desert setting Donald discovers the ice has melted. He notices a tent with the silhouettes of three belly dancing Arabic women, who turn out to be the Ritz Brothers. Excited, he asks them for their autographs, but behaving like screwballs they jump on Donald and sign their group name on his buttocks. An enraged Donald throws a paint can at their heads, but it hits the face of the guard instead. Again Donald has to flee and he runs to a castle with the sign The Road To Mandalay, which turns out to be just a model. After bumping his head into it and realizing his mistake he runs into another direction. On a pair of stairs he bumps into Shirley Temple. She, too, recognizes him and asks for an autograph. They both sit down to sign each other their autographs and Donald, excited he has his first real autograph, jumps in the air with joy. Then suddenly the guard finally grabs him and intends to beat him with his night club. Shirley tells him to leave Donald alone and he drops him on the floor in surprise. \\"Donald Duck? Did you say \\"Donald Duck\\"?\\". Other Hollywood actors hear his comment and enthusiastically rush to Donald to ask him to sign his autograph for them.

Samuel Woodward House is a historic house located at 19 Concord Road in Weston, Massachusetts. Built in 1753, it is a well-preserved example of mid-18th century Georgian architecture. It has also been home to a succession of people significant to the history of the town. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and was included in Weston's Boston Post Road Historic District in 1983. Description and history The Woodward House stands just west of the main cluster of buildings making up Weston village's commercial heart. It is located on the north side of Concord Road, just north of its junction with Boston Post Road, and roughly opposite the end of Fiske Lane. It is a typical Georgian colonial house, 2-1/2 stories in height, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. It has five bays on the front facade, with a central entry. The entry has been projected (a likely later addition) to provide a vestibule area under a gabled roof. The entry is framed by pilasters and a modest entablature; the gable above is pedimented. The house was built in 1753 by Reverend Samuel Woodward, the town's second minister, on land he purchased in 1752. The house is believed to incorporate elements of an older house, probably built by the previous landowner, William Smith. In addition to Rev. Woodward, the house has also been occupied by his successor, Rev. Samuel Kendal. Kendal sold the house to Artemas Ward, Jr., a prominent local lawyer and politician who lived in the house next door. Ward sold this house in 1797 to Dr. Amos Bancroft, who was the town physician for many years, and was active in local town government. It was owned for over 100 years by the Fiske family.

It was founded by 15 to 20 New Haven Jewish families, mostly from Bavaria, in 1840, when Jews were not allowed to form their own religious societies. These families took turns hosting services and event at their homes until the Connecticut Legislature, in 1843, enabled Jews to officially establish synagogues by allowing non-Christian organizations to incorporate in the state. Mishkan Israel‚Äôs first gatherings were held in a room above the Heller- Mendelbaum store at the corner of Grand and State Street in New Haven, Connecticut. This did not sit well with the New Haven Register, which reported on May 26, 1843: ‚ÄúWhilst we have been busy converting the Jews in other lands, they have outflanked us here, and effected a footing in the very centre of our own fortress.‚ÄùRae, Douglas W. , City: Urbanism and its End, Yale University Press, 2003, page 151. It became a Reform synagogue as early as 1856. Also in 1856 the congregation purchased the former Third Congregation Church, a Greek revival building on Court Street between State and Orange Street. The 1897 building, 55 Audubon Street on the corner of Orange Street in New Haven is now used as a performing arts space for ACES Educational Center for the Arts, a performing arts high school.Olitzky, Kerry M.; Raphael, Marc Lee. The American Synagogue: A Historical Dictionary and Sourcebook, Greenwood Press, June 30, 1996, pp. 76-80. It is a contributing building in the Orange Street Historic District. The architects were Arnold W. Brunner and Thomas Tryon. The congregation moved to Ridge Road in Hamden in 1960. Mishkan Israel became a bastion of liberal religious thought and social activism in the 1950s and 1960s. Then Rabbi Robert E. Goldburg was an outspoken advocate for civil rights, and was arrested in a freedom march along with Martin Luther King and other clergy in 1964. Earlier, Dr. King had delivered a sermon at Mishkan Israel in 1961, helping to dedicate the new facility, which had relocated to Hamden. It is said to have been Dr. King‚Äôs only preaching from a pulpit in the greater New Haven area. Rabbi Goldburg stirred congregants‚Äô passions with his strong and eloquent political voice raised frequently in support of racial justice and opposition to the Vietnam War. Dr. Daniel Ellsberg, Alger Hiss, Stokely Carmichael, and William Sloan Coffin were guest speakers at the behest of Rabbi Goldburg. The current rabbi at Mishkan Israel is Brian P. Immerman, who has served Mishkan Israel since 2018. He succeeds Rabbi Herbert N. Brockman, now the Emeritus, who had been the spiritual leader at Mishkan Israel for over 30 years. Rabbi Brockman teaches and engages in community projects, and has been at the forefront of interfaith understanding and justice, not only in New Haven, but also nationally and internationally.

The hall is named after the German shipowning company F. Laeisz, founder of the concert venue. The Baroque Revival Laeiszhalle was planned by the architect Martin Haller and inaugurated at its location on the Hamburg Wallring on June 4, 1908. At that time, the Musikhalle was Germany's largest and most modern concert hall. Composers such as Richard Strauss, Sergei Prokofiev, Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith played and conducted their works in the Laeiszhalle. Pianist Vladimir Horowitz gave one of his first international performances in 1926; violinist Yehudi Menuhin gave a guest performance in 1930 at the age of twelve. Following World War II, which it survived intact, the Laeiszhalle experienced an intermezzo when the British occupying forces used the space temporarily as a broadcast studio for their radio station BFN.Dr. Christoph Becher et. al: \\"100 Jahre Laeiszhalle - Musikhalle Hamburg\\", 2008 Maria Callas gave concerts in 1959 and 1962. In the 1960s the musical repertoire was also expanded to jazz and pop music, with performances by Pink Floyd, Lale Andersen, Bee Gees, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Udo J√ºrgens and Elton John. The Laeizhalle has two separate performance spaces. Due to its relatively low capacity and stage layout, the Laeiszhalle is particularly suitable for the performance of classical and early romantic repertoire, and less so for staging large-scale twentieth-century works. The management of both the Elbphilharmonie and the Laeiszhalle are under the direction of one concert company. Christoph Lieben- Seutter became General and Artistic Director in 2007.

Helen Storrow, a wealthy philanthropist who owned the land, also funded the construction of the houses, which were among the earliest of their style to be built in the United States. All four of the International houses were designed by internationally renowned architects, and three of those served as the architect's own residence. The most well known of these is the Gropius House at 68 Baker Bridge Road, a National Historic Landmark and house museum owned by Historic New England, which was designed by Bauhaus architect Walter Gropius as his personal residence. Two other houses on Woods End Road were also designed by Gropius and his friend Marcel Breuer.

It is a national radio station that broadcasts all over Indonesia and abroad to serve all Indonesia citizens anywhere in the country and abroad. RRI also provides information about Indonesia to people around the world. Voice of Indonesia is the division for abroad broadcasting. As an autonomous division, VOI has its own independent structure so it can find their own financial resources through marketing. History When Indonesia declared its independence on 17 August 1945, the new country needed an effective tool to announce its declaration of independence to the whole nation and to the world audience. At 19:00 on the same day, M. Jusuf Ronodipuro, founder of the RRI, has read the proclamation of news on Hoso Kyoku, Japanese occupation Radio. He was also supported by Dr. Abdulrahman Saleh, who had a passion for radio broadcasting. Both of them then launched the Voice of Free Indonesia on 23 August 1945. The first Indonesian President Sukarno delivered a speech on this radio on 25 August and Vice President Mohammad Hatta, did the same on 29 August. At that time, radio broadcasting was the most powerful media in order to deliver the message to reach the audiences around the world. To carry out this mission, the new Republic of Indonesia took over the former Dutch Colonial Government Radio station in Yogyakarta. The Indonesian broadcasting across the world was named Voice of Free Indonesia On 11 September 1945, the radio station became Radio Republik Indonesia (RRI), the head organization of Voice of Indonesia. During the Indonesian National Revolution, a Scottish American woman named K'tut Tantri, who was sympathetic to the Indonesian republicans, made several English language-broadcasts on the Voice of Free Indonesia. Her broadcasts were targeted at Western listeners and she gained the nickname \\"Surabaya Sue\\" due to her support for the Indonesian nationalists. During the early days of Indonesian independence, radio broadcasting played an important role in sending the new nation's message to overseas audiences, which helped other nations recognize the sovereignty of Indonesia. In addition, the Voice of Free Indonesia was also the name of an Indonesian Republican magazine that was marketed at Western correspondents. In 1950, Voice of Free Indonesia was renamed the Voice of Indonesia.Voice of Indonesia - Background Operations The target audience of VOI was recently mentioned as ‚Äògeneral audience‚Äô. Generally, there are three types of audience: Indonesian citizen abroad, Indonesian Diaspora and all the people across the globe. Before, VOI serves people abroad in 11-different languages. It has several programmes that broadcast in English, French, Spanish, German, Arabic, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Thai and Indonesian. Until 2010, each language broadcasts 2 hours of programming a day with total of 13 hours for the whole language broadcasting. There are four main programs of VOI: News and Information, Rhythm of Archipelago; programme about Indonesian music, Getting to know Indonesia; programme about unique and typical culture of the country, and the Archipelago Sketches; programme about regional autonomy policy that implements throughout the country. These programmes are first produced in Indonesian language and then translated into 11 different languages. The content of all foreign language programs are practically the same.Afgiansyah (2007) Repositioning VOI. The Hague: The Hague University Since 2018, VOI broadcasts 24 hours on internet and 12 hours on SW with only 3325 kHz. The 9525, 11785 and 15150 are inactive for the time being. In history, VOI broadcasts abroad using short wave frequencies 9525, 11785 and 15150 kHz, which it has used since it first went on the air.Voice of Indonesia - Vision and Mission Although shortwave broadcasting is the main core to deliver its product, VOI also operates a web site. Within the web site, audience may find written news in 11 different languages, as well as live streaming radio service which is started on 1 April 2008. However, the streaming service is not as fully functioned as the shortwave broadcasting. But since 2010 audio and video streaming is fully functioned as additional medium of broadcast. VOI uses social media such as Facebook, Google+ and Twitter to update information about Indonesia. And just recently to provide the service to mobile and smartphone user Voice of Indonesia has launched RRI World Service Play and RRI Play Go on Google Play store. The Voice of Indonesia has the visual program on RRI Net.

Description and history The Adams- Magoun House stands on Winter Hill in central Somerville, roughly midway between Magoun Square and the Winter Hill commercial district. It is set facing east on the south side of Broadway, between Bartlett Street and Glenwood Road. It is a 2¬Ω-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, two interior chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, with its entrance at the center, framed by pilasters and topped by a half-round transom window and gabled pediment.

Description and history The Alexander Foster House is located in Somerville's central Spring Hill neighborhood, at the northeast corner of Laurel and Green Streets. It is a three-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof section and a broad tower with a shallow- pitch hip roof to its left. The eaves of both roofs are extended, and supported by paired carved brackets. Building corners have paneled pilasters, and a single-story polygonal bay projects on the north side. The west-facing front facade is sheltered by a single-story porch, supported by round columns with bracketed tops, the brackets forming arched openings by meeting between the columns. Most windows are rectangular sash, framed by windows bracketed lintels and sills; the principal exception is a round-arch window located near the gable peak. Laurel Street was platted in 1843, but development in the area did not begin until somewhat later. This house, built about 1860, was one of the first to be built there, and was soon followed by others. It was built for Alexander Foster, a local lumber dealer.

It covers a part of the west side of Union Square that saw significant development during the city's growth in the 19th century, and has remained well-preserved since then. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The city of Somerville was until 1842 part of Charlestown, and was first settled in 1630. From an early date, a track developed that skirted Prospect Hill to the north and a marshy area to the south, between the center of Charlestown and Menotomy, as what is now Arlington was then called. This route now consists of Washington Street, Bow Street, and Somerville Avenue. The Bow Street section, a bend in the road around a marshy area, was eventually bypassed when the marsh was filled in, but was before then a point of development along the road. It remained a significant area of development in the 19th century, as the Union Square area developed as the town's (and later city's) principal area of industry and commerce in the 19th century. The principal intersection of Union Square has been intensively redeveloped, but a portion of Bow Street has managed to retain its 19th-century character. The historic district covers most of Bow Street, omitting only a few buildings at its eastern end. It includes, among other buildings, a former police station, built c. 1875 in the Gothic Victorian style, the 1887 Romanesque Revival Prospect Hill Congregational Church, and two buildings (the Drouet Block and the Richmond, both from 1898) designed by architect Aaron Gould that served as both commercial space and apartment-style hotels.

The show was created and written by Errol Bruce, Chas Lawther, Michael Lennick and Jeff Silverman. During its run, The All Night Show ran Mondays through Saturdays, running from the end of other programming (typically 2 am, but 1 am on Saturdays) until 6 am. It featured early voice work by Maurice LaMarche and Jim Carrey, both at the very start of their careers. Premise The premise was that Lawther's character, Chuck the Security Guard, had, with the help of his friends, taken over the facilities of CFMT (which at that time was branding itself as \\"MTV\\", prior to the introduction of the American music channel MTV.) Ostensibly without the knowledge of the station owners, Chuck and company found \\"a bunch of cool old tapes in the basement\\" of CFMT, and ‚Äì each night after the station officially went off the air ‚Äì started broadcasting their favourite shows over the air while fooling around with the equipment. In the series continuity, rather than fire Chuck, the station decided to let him continue by giving Chuck his own overnight show. The All-Night Show generally showed reruns of classic series such as The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, The Prisoner, Car 54, Where Are You?, The Beverly Hillbillies, Dave Allen at Large, Sgt. Bilko, and many others. The show filled the space in between each episode with current and decades-old music videos (including old Scopitones), old movie shorts, clips sent in from viewers, viewer call-in segments, and comedic banter with Chuck and the crew. Cast Chas Lawther played Chuck, a friendly, slightly awkward late-night security guard. Chuck addressed the audience directly, and introduced the night's programming from a TV studio control panel‚Äîactually placing the video tapes in the playback machine to be played on air. Chuck's show opening, a loud, upbeat \\"Hey, you!\\", became a catchphrase for both the character and the show. Occasionally, Chuck would venture beyond his base in the CFMT TV control room and explore the empty station at night while doing his rounds; memorably, he once broke into real-life station president Dan Iannuzzi's office and made himself at home in Iannuzzi's absence.Foolish Earthling Productions: 10,000 Shiftless Nights production information The other ever-present regular on the show was Chuck's often-heard but never-seen friend Ryerson Dupont (Errol Bruce), the Scottish-accented camera operator. As an in-joke, Ryerson was named after Toronto's Ryerson University (then called Ryerson Polytechnical Institute), known for its Radio and Television Arts program. Heard far less frequently as an off-camera voice was audio technician P.B. Leonard, played by Michael Lennick. (Behind the scenes, Bruce and Lennick really did operate the camera and run the audio system, and were also the show's co-directors.) A continuing feature had the lips of Maurice LaMarche inserted into a photograph of a famous person, and having LaMarche imitate that person to deliver a show promo or announcement. When LaMarche left the show, a young up-and-coming comic named Jim Carrey was recruited to take his place as a voice actor. Both Carrey and LaMarche were at this point just beginning their careers. Seen on-camera from time to time was Suzette Couture as Fran the Night Nurse, a cheerful friend who would drop by to visit Chuck after her late shift had ended. Another recurring character was Paul Goldberg as Paul del Stud, a fifties-styled 'greaser' who would incongruously read out household cleaning tips as show bumpers leading into or out of commercials. Content and recurring features The show had a deliberately loose, semi- unstructured feel. Viewers would often call in and chat with Chuck and Ryerson‚Äîthe day after the death of John Lennon, much of the show was devoted to viewers calling in and sharing their stories of their reaction to Lennon's death. Viewers were also encouraged to send in videos they had made, and some viewers would do this frequently, becoming semi-regular contributors to the show. There were periodic contests, with viewers being invited to correctly guess the origin of old movie clips, or to identify actors in the TV series being shown. One memorable contest featured producer Jeff Silverman (in character as a pirate) giving clues to the location of a buried treasure. Unfortunately, the show found themselves in trouble with the local police when a larger-than-expected crowd of people, spurred on by the clues, started digging up Toronto's isolated Cherry Beach to recover the hidden 'treasure', creating a safety hazard for beach visitors. A recurring feature was \\"The Elevator To The Stars\\", in which various individual local performers would ride the CFMT freight elevator up to the studio level and‚Äîwithout leaving the elevator‚Äîbe given a short period of time to sing, dance, or tell jokes on-air before the elevator doors closed and took them downstairs again. The show would have musical guests, usually on Thursday nights, both as interview guests and as performers. Notable musicians who appeared on The All Night Show included James Cotton, Richie Havens, David Wilcox, Domenic Troiano, Bruce Cockburn, Burton Cummings, Mary Margaret O'Hara and King Biscuit Boy.Silverman, Jeff and Drew Tapley, Funny Business, BurmanBooks, New York, 2011. Other guests would occasionally be interviewed; however, a supposed interview with Twilight Zone writer/director Montgomery Pittman (via telephone) was a hoax, as Pittman died in 1962. \\"Pittman\\", it was later revealed, was played by Wayne Robson. Demise The show only lasted one year, ending when CFMT cut its budget for the time slot.\\"Channel 47's Chuck turning in his keys,\\" Jim Bawden, Toronto Star, August 6, 1981, p. E1. In the final moments of the final episode, as the credits rolled, Ryerson was finally seen on camera. Ten Thousand Shiftless Nights, a documentary about The All Night Show (which also served as a de facto reunion special) was aired on CFMT in 2007. The special was hosted by Lawther, and featured clips and reminiscences from Lawther, Bruce, Silverman, Lennick and others associated with the show.

In April 1971, she deployed again to the Sixth Fleet and stayed in the Mediterranean until October 1971. During this tour of duty, she earned the Supply Efficiency \\"E,\\" rescued sailors from a burning Greek freighter, and represented the Sixth Fleet at Admiral Farragut Day at Menorca in Spains Balearic Islands. On 27 July 1972, following more than nine months back in the United States operating and training along U.S,. East Coast, San Diego got underway to return to the Sixth Fleet. She arrived at Rota, Spain, on 4 August 1972 and relieved USS Sylvania (AFS-2) as the on- station combat stores ship with the Sixth Fleet. At the end of another six months of service in the Mediterranean, San Diego got underway to return to Norfolk in January 1973. She arrived on 26 January and resumed normal operations with the Atlantic Fleet. San Diego operated out of Norfolk, along the U.S. East Coast, and in the Caribbean until late October 1973. At that time, she departed Norfolk for her fourth tour of duty in the Mediterranean. She arrived at Rota, Spain, on 4 November 1973. She cruised the Mediterranean with the Sixth Fleet for the next six months, getting underway from Rota on 19 April 1974 to return to Norfolk. San Diego reached Norfolk on 27 April 1974. Between June 1974 and June 1976 San Diego made two more deployments to the Sixth Fleet and an additional excursion to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for refresher training. During the three Mediterranean cruises from 1973 to 1976, USS San Diego stopped in ports from Lisbon, Portugal, to the Greek Island of Corfu, just off the coast of Albania. The easternmost port San Diego visited was Athens, and the only North African port she called at was Tunis, Tunisia. Palma de Mallorca and Naples, Italy were the ports she most frequented during those years. On its next deployment to the Mediterranean Sea from October 1976 to April 1977, San Diego serviced task groups led by aircraft carriers USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV 42), USS John F. Kennedy (CV 67), USS Nimitz (CV 68) as well as the fleet Amphibious Task Group on a rotating basis, by Underway and Vertical Replenishment, and also provided in-port Vertical Replenishment to Sixth Fleet auxiliary forces docked at La Maddalena, Corsica and Souda Bay, Crete. The ship made port calls at Naples, Italy, Palma de Majorca, Livorno, Italy, Athens, Greece and Almeria, Spain. During the deployment San Diego's two embarked CH-46D helicopters from Helicopter Combat Support Squadron Six (HC-6) were involved in separate accidents during night Vertical Replenishment operations, and each was lost at sea. On 17 January 1989, San Diego was involved in a collision with the submarine in the Thimble Shoal channel, as both vessels were headed to sea. While trying to pass San Diego, Norfolk delivered a glancing blow to the port side of San Diego. There were no injuries, but both vessels received minor damage. San Diego anchored for two days while her crewmen evaluated the damage, and then accomplished a restricted scope phased maintenance availability at Jonathan Corp., from 8 February to 16 March, followed by additional repairs in non-self-propelled medium auxiliary floating dry dock Sustain (AFDM-7), from 30 March to 10 April 1989. Transfer to Military Sealift Command On 11 August 1993 San Diego was decommissioned, transferred to the U.S. Navys Military Sealift Command, and placed in non-commissioned service as a United States Naval Ship with a mostly civilian crew as USNS San Diego (T-AFS-6). :[1993-1997] San Diego continued in service until 10 December 1997 when she was laid up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Disposal San Diego was stricken from the Navy List on 10 December 1997 and she was sold for scrapping at Philadelphia on 9 April 2006.

Background During the Second World War and for two decades after 1950, Bingham worked for MI5, and had long been said to be the inspiration for John le Carr√©'s character George Smiley.'Baron in search for Ascot house', Evening Press, 28 Feb 2004Michael Jago, The Man who was George Smiley: The Life of John Bingham (2013), reviewed by the former Director General of MI5, Stella Rimington, in The Spectator, 2 March 2013, p. 36. In 1999, le Carr√© confirmed that Bingham had been an inspiration for Smiley and went further in 2000, writing in an introduction to a reissue of one of Bingham's novels: \\"He had been one of two men who had gone into the making of George Smiley. Nobody who knew John and the work he was doing could have missed the description of Smiley in my first novel\\".John le Carr√©, Introduction to John Bingham, My Name is Michael Sibley, London: Pan Classic Crime (2000) John le Carr√© wrote that Bingham encouraged him to write his first novel, Call for the Dead (1961), while still being an active MI5 officer, and in a BBC Radio Front Row interview in 2009 said that Bingham's successful thriller novels, published when the two men worked together at MI5 in the 1950s, inspired him to write his first two books. Jack King speculation In February 2014, MI5 released files at the National Archives on the \\"Fifth Column\\" operation, which aimed to identify British Nazi sympathizers during World War II. Some newspapers named Bingham as the agent at the heart of the operation,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war- two/10665482/The-spy-who-turned-Hitlers-British-supporters-into-unwitting- double-agents.html but the release of more files in October 2014 corrected this, and named the agent as Eric Roberts, a former bank clerk from Epsom. Bingham was recruited into MI5 by Maxwell Knight to work in the counter- intelligence and political infiltration based M Section. He had volunteered to serve in the army but a sight defect prevented him from serving in the field. Prior to his service in MI5, Bingham had been the Art Editor of the Sunday Dispatch.The National Archives, Kew, file no. KV4/227 p. 9.

He received the American Pacific Theater of War Ribbon and the American Theater of War Ribbon for his naval service during the Second World War. In 1949, he received his Bachelor's Degree from Millikin University, and in 1959 he received his Master's Degree from Eastern Illinois University. Coaching career He began his coaching career in 1949‚Äì54 in Effingham, Illinois, as St. Anthony High School's first full-time basketball coach, leading the team to \\"unprecedented success\\"Grimes, Bill, \\"Former St A coach's son pens memoirs: short time in Effingham creates lasting memories,\\" Effingham Daily News, July 24, 2012. while compiling a 21‚Äì7 record in his first year and an overall five-year record of 95‚Äì43. His team won the school's first National Trail Conference Championship in 1952‚Äì53. He was head basketball and baseball coach and athletic director at Quincy College (now Quincy University) from 1954 to 1957. During his first year at Quincy, his basketball team earned a berth in the quarterfinals of the NAIA national tournament in Kansas City, which was Quincy College's first athletic team to qualify for a national competition. That team's 17‚Äì9 season set the best record in the school's history at the time. Forrester did something other colleges refused to do during the segregation era - play black players. To African-American guard Dick Thompson, Coach Harry Forrester was a visionary: \\"He had the courage to look a little ahead of the curve,\\" Thompson said of his Quincy College basketball coach. \\"He played guys who had the ability to get the job done. It didn't matter the color of your skin. That's a tribute to him as a person, that he looked far beyond the situation and had the courage to do what he did in playing guys of color.\\" African-American forward Edsel Bester said that Coach Forrester pre-dated the principles of Martin Luther King by refusing to judge a person by the color of his skin. \\"He judged each one of us by the content of our character. He let us know we were not only representing ourselves but our parents, our coach and our school, and he didn't want you to forget that. I loved Coach Harry Forrester and I thank God every day in my life that I knew him.\\" In his ground-breaking work on behalf of racial equality in sport, Harry Forrester was a decade ahead of the integrated basketball teams at Loyola University Chicago and Texas Western, which gained greater fame in the 1960s. In an article on 29 September 2012, Stever Eighinger of the Quincy Herald-Whig noted that \\"Harry Forrester did not spend much time in Quincy, but it's safe to say his impact will be remembered forever,\\" recalling that his decision, as Quincy College's head basketball coach, to play five black basketball players \\"came at the height of racial insensitivity in the mid-to-late 1950s and was a full decade before Texas Western (now UTEP) started five black players in what is now the NCAA Division I national championship game. A movie was made about that Texas Western team, but outside of Quincy, only a handful of people to this day realize history was first made [by Forrester] in West-Central Illinois.\\" Eighinger observed that Forrester \\"eventually earned as much respect for his decision to play five black players as he did for leading the Hawks to their first national tournament appearance.\\" Eighinger, Steve, \\"Book helps keep memories alive for son,\\" Quincy Herald-Whig, September 29, 2012. A second article by Eighinger in the Quincy Herald-Whig on 3 October 2012,Eighinger, Steven, Quincy (IL) Herald-Whig, 3 October 2012. reflected on the death of Ed Crenshaw, the Quincy basketball team's captain and leading scorer in the 1950s: \\"'Easy Ed' was one of the nicest men I ever met, and if you are a longtime Quincy University basketball fan that name probably rings a bell. And if you have never heard of Easy Ed, Dick Thompson, Edsel Bester, Ben Bumbry and Bill Lemon, well ... you should have. \\"Those five men, and their coach, the late Harry Forrester, made history in the mid-1950s with the Hawks basketball program. The problem, at the time, was no one realized it. \\"A decade later, it was a big deal when Texas Western, which is now known as UTEP, started five black players in the NCAA Tournament championship game against Kentucky. A few years ago, they even made a movie about their coach, Don Haskins, and those players. Harry Forrester and the players from Quincy never received that kind of (positive) attention. \\"The 1950s and 1960s were a much different time in America when it came to racism and sports, especially at the amateur level. This was a time when the Mississippi State basketball team declined an invitation to take part in the NCAA Tournament because it might have to play against an opponent with black players. At that time, many black players preferred to attend 'historically black colleges' rather than be subjected to the treatment those from Quincy received. Easy Ed, Dick Thompson, Edsel Bester, Ben Bumbry and Bill Lemon were subjected to racial taunts and threats when they played on the road. Somehow, Forrester and those players led Quincy College to its first appearance in a national tournament - the NAIA event in Kansas City, Mo. - during the coach's 1954-57 stay here. \\"After winning its opening-round game in the 32-school tournament, Quincy lost its next start by four points to a team considered far inferior‚Äîbut white. Quincy's black players were constantly in foul trouble and the Hawks got few, if any, breaks when it came to officials' calls. To this day, if you ask any of those Quincy players, they will tell you they did not lose the second game of that national tournament. The other team simply wound up with more points on the scoreboard.

The shrine promotes the dairy industry and records its history. As of 2007, the organization had over 18,000 members from most facets of dairying. It holds an annual ceremony where it inducts members of the dairy industry into its hall of fame. Hoard Historical Museum The National Dairy Shrine's museum is located in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin. It shares a visitor center with the Hoard Historical Museum, which was William D. Hoard's house. Hoard, Wisconsin's 16th governor, was a prominent dairy advocate though his weekly publication, Hoard's Dairyman. The National Dairy Shrine's museum contains exhibits about the history of dairying. Dairying objects in its collection include butter churns, milking machines, a treadle, and items used in the Babcock test for fat content of milk, which was developed nearby at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. The Hoard Historical Museum focuses on local history. Permanent exhibits include mounted bird dioramas, Native American artifacts, Sauk chief Black Hawk and the 1832 Black Hawk War, local poet Lorine Niedecker, quilts and antique clothing, and the mid-19th century period Foster House.

Patterson (born 1981, Kingston, Jamaica) is a Jamaican-born visual artist and educator. She is known for her large and colorful tapestries created our of various materials such as, glitter, sequins, fabric, toys, beads, faux flowers, jewelry, and other embellishments, her \\"Gangstas for Life series\\" of dancehall portraits, and her garden-inspired installations. She has taught at the University of Virginia, Edna Manley College School of Visual and Performing Arts and is a tenured Associate Professor in Painting and Mixed Media at the University of Kentucky. Her work has been shown in numerous solo and group exhibitions in Jamaica, the United States, and abroad.  Early life and education  Patterson was born in 1981, Kingston, Jamaica. She studied painting at Edna Manley College of Visual and Performing Arts in Kingston, Jamaica and graduated in 2004. Patterson received an MFA degree in 2006 in printmaking and drawing from the Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts at Washington University in St. Louis. Work Patterson's early work often revolves around questions of identity and the body, and takes the form of mixed media paintings, drawings and collages, most of them on paper. Photography, found objects, installation and performance have recently become increasingly important in her practice. Early work was primarily concerned with the female body as object. Her Venus Investigations objectified the female torso, headless and anonymous, and explored the relationship between the ample-bodied \\"Venus\\" or female goddess images of prehistoric times and contemporary female self-images and beauty ideals. Subsequent works more provocatively focused on the vagina as an object and, by implication, examined the taboos that surround this body part and its functions within Jamaican culture. This also led to 3-dimensional constructions made from intimate female articles such as sanitary napkins and tampons and more abstracted and surreal hybrid organic forms that appeared in her large paper collages of 2007. This early body of work has a sober and at times even majestic visual beauty which as she puts it, references \\"beauty through the use of the grotesque but visceral, confrontational and deconstructed.\\" Patterson's 2016 solo show at the Museum of Arts and Design, Dead Treez, incorporated several appliqu√©d commercially-woven Jacquard weavings in which Patterson used restaged images of photographs that had been taken of murder victims in Jamaica and then circulated on social media. The exhibition also included a collection of mannequins in vibrant Jamaican dance hall wear (titled Swag Swag Krew), and a series of vitrines with artificial flora and jewelry belonging to the collection of the Museum of Arts and Design and in which patterned bodies reclined (titled ...buried again to carry on growing...), again referencing the victims of violent crime. In 2018, Patterson was invited to participate in the first edition of Open Spaces, a series of installations, performances, and talks in Kansas City, Missouri. Her installation ...called up focused on one of two public pools in Swope Park. She ran a Kickstarter campaign to \\"reclaim and revitalize\\" the site dedicated to Dr. Harry M. Gilkey, who used the pool in 1956 to teach hydrotherapy to youth with physical handicaps. Patterson describes the site in the Kickstarter campaign, noting: > I want to better honor this history by taking down the fence, cleaning the > space, and creating a work here. I also want to ask what it means to > memorialize not just a site that was already memorialized, but also to > embellish a site that is already embellished. What does it mean to give > presence and meaning to a space that has been essentially unheard of? How do > we reclaim what is meant for the collective? These are questions I want to > pose not only for the exhibition but also for the community who once used it > and will now use it again, and learn from what they have to say. Patterson further elaborated after the work was complete, noting, \\"I am very interested in how regular people claim space and that's what street side memorials do. So when a tragedy happens, they mark the space by adding things that we would associate with a memorial in the same way that we're seeing here so there are flowers, there are toys, there are candles.\\" The work was received positively by those who frequently visit Swope Park.Untitled I From the Hybrid Series Mixed Media Drawing on Paper 5ftx3ft 2007 Gangstas for Life series (2008 ‚Äì ongoing)  One of Patterson's most recognized body of work is a series entitled \\"Gangstas for Life,\\" which explores conceptions of masculinity within Dancehall culture. In this series, the artist specifically explores skin bleaching as a means of marking and transformation, not as an act of racial self-loathing. Additionally the series \\"seeks to examine the dichotomy between Jamaican stereotypical ideologies of homosexual practices and its parallels within dancehall culture.\\" Red floral and fish motifs throughout the series serve to represent homosexuality within a predominantly homophobic culture. Patterson's images imaginatively recreate portraits of young black males who bleach their skin, pluck their eyebrows and wear 'bling' jewelry to enhance their gangsta status. Patterson finds beauty in their psychic violence glamorizing them with glittered halos and luscious lipstick.Petrine Archer- Straw, Petrinearcher.com The artist explores perceptions of beauty as grotesque within the series, and her portrayal of the subjects' cracked, bleeding and oozing skin.Untitled II-From the Gangstas for Life series, 3.5ft x 5ft mixed media on hand-cut paper 2007  Public art collections  Patterson's work is held in a number of public art institutions, this is a select list including: *P√©rez Art Museum, Miami, Florida *Arkansas Arts Center, Little Rock, Arkansas *Birmingham Museum of Art, Birmingham, Alabama *Eastern Illinois University, Tarble Arts Center, Charleston, Illinois *Edna Manley College of the Visual Arts, Kingston, Jamaica *Nasher Museum, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina *National Gallery of Jamaica, Kingston, Jamaica * Wifredo Lam Center for Contemporary Art, Havana, Cuba *Nerman Museum of Contemporary Art, Overland Park, Kansas *Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania *Pont-Aven School of Contemporary Art, Pont-Aven, France *Seattle Art Museum, Seattle, Washington *Speed Art Museum, Louisville, Kentucky *Studio Museum in Harlem, New York City, New York ReferencesExternal links * *Ebony Patterson profile on Google Arts and Culture Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Jamaican women artists Category:Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts alumni Category:People of Jamaican descent Category:University of Kentucky faculty Category:People from Kingston, Jamaica Category:People from Lexington, Kentucky ","title":"Ebony Patterson"},{"id":"18765770","text":"Ongudaysky District (; ) is an administrativeLaw #101-RZ and municipalLaw #10-RZ district (raion), one of the ten in the Altai Republic, Russia.

The correlation between wealth and religion has been subject to academic research. Wealth is the status of being the beneficiary or proprietor of a large accumulation of capital and economic power. Religion is a cultural system that often involves belief in supernatural forces and may intend to provide a moral system or a meaning of life. Generally, high income and wealth correlate with low religiosity. Jews, Unitarians, and Episcopalians typically rank as the highest income groups. Statistics= Global  According to a study from 2015, Christians hold the largest amount of wealth (55% of the total world wealth), followed by Muslims (5.8%), Hindus (3.3%), and Jews (1.1%). According to the same study it was found that adherents under the classification Irreligion or other religions hold about 34.8% of the total global wealth. A study done by the nonpartisan wealth research firm New World Wealth found that 56.2% of the 13.1 million millionaires in the world were Christians,The religion of millionaires while 6.5% were Muslims, 3.9% were Hindu, and 1.7% were Jewish; 31.7% were identified as adherents of \\"other\\" religions or \\"not religious\\".  United States  A chart illustrating income by religious grouping in the US in 2001 A study in the United States (based on data from 1985‚Äì1998), conducted by the sociologist Lisa A. Keister and published in the Social Forces journal, found that adherents of Judaism and Episcopalianism accumulated the most wealth, believers in Catholicism and mainline Protestants were in the middle, while conservative Protestants accumulated the least; in general, people who attend religious services accumulated more wealth than those who do not (taking into account variations of education and other factors). Keister suggested that wealth accumulation is shaped by family processes. According to the study, the median net worth of people believing in Judaism is calculated at 150,890 USD, while the median net worth of conservative Protestants (including Baptists, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh-day Adventists, Christian Scientists) was 26,200 USD. The overall median in the dataset was 48,200 USD. Another study in the United States, from 2012, stated that 48% of Hindus had a household income of $100,000 or more, and 70% make at least $75,000, which is the highest among all religions in United States. According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, Jewish again ranked as the most financially successful religious group in the United States, with 44% of Jews living in households with incomes of at least $100,000, followed by Hindu (36%), Episcopalians (35%), and Presbyterians (32%). Amongst Jews, in 2016, Modern Orthodox Jews had a median household income of $158,000, while Open Orthodoxy Jews had a median household income of $185,000 (compared to the American median household income of $59,000 in 2016).5 key takeaways, some surprising, from new survey of US Modern Orthodox Jews By BEN SALES 30 September 2017, JTA According to the same study there is correlation between education and income, about 77% of American Hindus have an undergraduate degree, followed by Jews (59%), Episcopalians (56%), and Presbyterians (47%). Explanations A study published in the American Journal of Sociology by Lisa Keister, found that \\"wealth affects religion indirectly through educational attainment, fertility, and female labor force participation\\" but also found some evidence of direct effects of religion on wealth attainment. Keister notes that certain religious beliefs (\\"one should have many children\\", \\"women should not work\\") lower wealth accumulation, both on the micro- and macro-scale.

Biography Uesugi Narinori was the eldest son of Uesugi Narisada and received the kanji of \\"nari\\" from Shogun Tokugawa Ienari as a special mark of favor. In 1836, he was awarded the courtesy titles of Shikibu-no-daiyu and Jiju, and Court rank of Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade. This title was raised to Danj≈çitaihitsu in 1839 when he became daimy≈ç. Early in his tenure, he revived the practice of borrowing money from his retainers, which he used to fund the military modernization of the domain in response to ever increasing demands from the shogunate to contribute to Japan's coastal defenses. In 1859, the domain suffered from a severe epidemic of smallpox. In 1863, he was ordered to accompany Shogun Tokugawa Iemochi to Kyoto and was placed in charge of security at Nij≈ç Castle during the visit. His courtesy title was also raised to Sakonoe-gon-ch≈´j≈ç and in 1864 his court rank was increased to Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade. In 1866, in recognition of the efforts he had made to modernize the domain's military and the expenses which had been incurred, the shogunate decided to raise the kokudaka of the domain by 30,000 koku. This was the first increase in territory which the domain had received in over 200 years. Politically Uesugi Narinori was a reformer, and supported ending Japan's national isolation policy. With the start of the Boshin War, Uesugi Narinori was initially inclined to support the new Meiji government; however Yonezawa Domain was targeted for destruction by the Satch≈ç Alliance along with Aizu Domain and his letters to the new government were rebuffed with exceeding rude responses. Outraged by the response, he joined with Sendai Domain in forming the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei. Initially the domain had a string of military victories even seizing the Port of Niigata. However, with the defection of Shibata Domain, the tide turned and the Uesugi forces were pushed back. Narinori approached the Meiji government again, offering to surrender. His offer was accepted only under the condition that the Uesugi army fight against their former allies of Kubota Domain and Aizu Domain (in the Battle of Aizu). Afterwards, the Meiji government still punished the domain by a reduction in its kokudaka of 140,000 koku. Furthermore, in 1868, he was forced into retirement. In 1869, his court rank was demoted to Junior Fifth Rank. He died in Tokyo in 1889. See also *Uesugi clan  References  Onodera, Eik≈ç (2005). Boshin nanboku sens≈ç to T≈çhoku seiken.

It was ahead of its time in several ways and its later versions were among the few mono-synths of its time to have MIDI. Around 2000 were made.  History  When synthesizer manufacturer Electronic Dream Plant folded in 1982, Chris Huggett went on to form the Oxford Synthesiser Company. The OSCar synthesizer was launched in 1983. Chris Huggett designed the electronics while independent product designer Anthony Harrison-Griffin was responsible for the unique look and build of the OSCar.  Design and features  Harrison-Griffin's use of distinctive black rubberized components to protect the controls and main casing became one of the instrument's most distinctive visual features. He even built a dummy 3-pin mains socket into the ends to safely store the plug.https://medias.audiofanzine.com/images/normal/osc-oscar-1516159.jpg While the basic structure of the OSCar is the common subtractive synthesis model, it has many unusual features and design quirks. The main difference from other synthesizers of the time was its digital oscillators and control system. The oscillators have an array of standard wave shapes including triangle, sawtooth, square and a variable pulse-width modulation, but the digital system also provides additive synthesis. New waveforms can be created by changing the amplitudes of up to 24 harmonics, widening the available sound palette in comparison with purely analogue synths. The two oscillators can either be played together monophonically, or the OSCar can be set in a duophonic mode where they keyboard controls one oscillator and the sequencer the other. The filter consists of two 12dB/Oct analog filters that can be combined into either a 24dB low pass, a 24dB high pass or a 12dB bandpass filter. A similar design had been known from other analog synths of the era, such as the Roland Jupiter-6, but the OSCar has its own unique twist on it, by having a \\"Separation\\" control that allowed separate cutoff frequencies for the filters. The resulting two resonance peaks can give a unique \\"vocal\\" character. The OSCar has an elementary sequencer. In duophonic mode it allows the user to play a monophonic lead whilst a sequence plays simultaneously. Many sequencers at the time could only play notes of a fixed length but on the OSCar it was possible to lengthen individual notes or insert rests.  Users  Although only 2000 OSCars were made they found their way into many professional hands. Ultravox used one for the solo on \\"Love's Great Adventure\\", and it is used for the bass on Stevie Wonder's \\"Skeletons\\", Jean-Michel Jarre's Revolutions Overture, and \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\".

The squad was formed based on the premise that the best people to search for missing bushwalkers are experienced bushwalkers, who are expected to understand the bush, to know how to navigate in difficult terrain, and to know the hidden passes and the common mistakes walkers make while trying to find a route in difficult country. These days NSW SES Bush Search and Rescue searches not only for bushwalkers but also for elderly missing persons, despondent persons and victims of crime.  History = Testing the concept: 1932  Prior to formation of the Bushwalker Search and Rescue Section in November 1936, various bushwalking clubs realised the need for an organised search and rescue capability. A search exercise was held in 1932 by members of the Sydney Bush Walkers and Mountain Trails Club looking for three lost walkers near the Royal National Park. The lost walkers were located by their distress signal of three smoky fires even though the day was misty. There was a boom in bushwalking during the 1930s so a need for an adequate search and rescue response was identified.  Formation: 1936  During early 1936, Ninian Melville of The New South Wales Federation of Bushwalking Clubs proposed that the federation form a \\"Topographic Bureau\\" that could provide walking information and to \\"record particulars of persons who would be available in cases of emergency for search and rescue parties.\\" Ninian was transferred to the country before this idea could be implemented. Despite this, an event was soon to catalyze the formation of a Search and Rescue Section of the Federation. On Saturday 3 October 1936, four young men set off to walk from Govetts Leap at Blackheath to Richmond via the Grose Valley. The men took only enough food for three days as they were certain they would make Richmond by then. A track was followed for the first two days but on the third day the track became hard to spot and the men encountered heavy vegetation. On the fourth day heavy rain soaked the men and on the fifth day the men decided to split up: two would push on ahead and the other two would continue at their own pace behind. Later that day, one of the lagging men, fatigued and out of food, could walk no further and decided to stay in a cave whilst the other would speed up and catch up with leading pair. On the sixth day this man caught up to the leading pair but after encountering thick scrub and not having eaten for 30 hours one of the three men could not continue and camped in a cave whilst the remaining two pressed on. Later that evening, a search party from Richmond had found the two walking men about 10 miles from Richmond and 20 miles from Blackheath. The search team and located men then proceeded back together to the second cave to pick up the man resting there by evening. The young man in the first cave was picked up by the group around 10:00 am on the seventh day. Search participants included police, bushwalkers and other civilians. Immediately after the search, a team of bushwalkers that were involved in the search including Paddy Pallin, suggested that a Search and Rescue group be established in what appeared to be a move to deploy experienced bushwalker teams much faster into the field than what had traditionally been done. NSW Police agreed that a more organised and coordinated response to missing persons in the bush was needed using people with specialised knowledge and skills. A sub-committee consisting of Paddy Pallin (Convener), Robert Savage (Assistant Convener), Herb Freeman, Tom Herbert and Bill Holesgrove was formed in 1936 and met several times prior to the formal establishment of the Search and Rescue Section. The Search and Rescue Section was formally established on 27 November 1936 when The New South Wales Federation of Bushwalking Clubs concluded at a committee meeting that a Search and Rescue Section was acceptable and unanimously moved that the section \\"should be empowered to act on its own initiative\\" rather than as a sub-committee of the Federation. Preliminary organisation was completed by February 1937 with a \\"loosely organised unit\\" established and the Commissioner of Police was informed of the unit. The unit was \\"subsequently called out on many occasions\\" and seemed to have a high success rate at locating lost bushwalkers. This unit was called the Bushwalker Search and Rescue Section; the birth of the present day Bush Search and Rescue New South Wales.  Affiliation with the VRA: 1970  The Volunteer Rescue Association (VRA) was formed as an oversight organisation to ensure standardisation of equipment and practices amongst the many community raised rescue squads in NSW. Bushwalkers Search and Rescue Section affiliated with the VRA in 1970.  Incorporation: 2001  By 2000, changing times prompted the subcommittee to form into an incorporated entity, with more highly trained membership (requiring specialist skills to effectively work with other search agencies). On 16 February 2001 Bushwalkers Search and Rescue (B S&R;) became an incorporated association and renamed to Bushwalkers Wilderness Rescue Squad (BWRS).Certificate of Incorporation as an Association or change of name, NSW Fair Trading, 14 March 2017  Change of name: 2017  To better reflect the roles performed, on 14 March 2017 Bushwalkers Wilderness Rescue Squad (BWRS) was renamed to Bush Search and Rescue New South Wales Incorporated (BSAR NSW).  A NSW SES unit: 2018  During April 2018, BSAR NSW members voted to cease affiliation with the Volunteer Rescue Association and register as a NSW State Emergency Service (SES) specialist unit, reporting to State Headquarters. On 1 May 2018 the 'NSW SES Bush Search and Rescue Unit' was activated.  Capability = Remote Land Search  The NSW SES Bush Search and Rescue Unit specialises in remote and rugged land Search and Rescue (SAR) with the ability to operate in steep terrain and thick vegetation well away from command posts and base locations. The squad normally works under the coordination of NSW Police and works closely with NSW Police Rescue. Less demanding Land SAR duties in areas such as urban fringes and can also be carried performed.  72 hours unassisted  Unless advised otherwise, NSW SES Bush Search and Rescue Unit Field Members (search team members) must arrive at a search with the ability to deploy away from base in the field and search for 72 hours without resupply. This is a significant capability for the Search and Rescue Mission Coordinator (SMC) to have at hand.  Organic radio communications  The NSW SES Bush Search and Rescue Unit is a long term user of High Frequency (HF) radio which allows communications from effectively any location in the bush. HF radio does not require line of sight between the search team and Command Post and has proven more reliable than satellite phones in the BSAR operating environment. HF radio also provides an instant 'day one' radio network by simply setting up a Command Post radio and issuing HF units to search teams. SES BSAR also utilise a number of other radio communication devices based upon terrain and situation. These include SES standard issue GRN capable radios (which include UHF, VHF, simplex and analog options) as well as satellite phones and two-way satellite communication devices such as the Garmin InReach. These offer increased situational awareness, safety and secure communications to the Commander.  Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS)  During November 2014, BSAR NSW became one of the first operators in Australia of a RPAS (Drone) at an official land search operation. The RPAS significantly reduced search time of cliff areas and decreased human risk exposure. Since then BSAR NSW has used the industry knowledge of its members to test and develop a safe and efficient RPAS capability. Simple RPAS can be employed by BSAR NSW in exposed cliff areas in many areas of NSW away from aerodromes to increase search efficiency and maximise search resources. However, since leaving the VRA and joining the NSW State Emergency Service, drone use is currently on hold pending SES policy.  Leadership  NSW SES Bush Search and Rescue Unit Commanders and Team Leaders offer solid leadership, command and control skills to the SMC. These members can be used to lead multi-agency teams in remote land SAR operations or to coordinate search operations.  NavShield  Every year the NSW SES Bush Search and Rescue Unit organises and runs the Australian Emergency Services Wilderness Navigation Shield or NavShield event. Participants test their bush and compass navigation abilities in an overnight event through 100 km2 of wilderness terrain a few hours drive from Sydney, Australia. The location of the event is different each year. This is an important training event for NSW emergency services.  Joining = Field Members  Field members are required to have map and compass back country navigation skills and adequate multi-day off-track bushwalking experience prior to joining BSAR. They must also complete a multi-day induction walk in moderate topography to demonstrate bush skills, bush fitness and teamwork skills. The onus is on the member to bring with him/her solid bush skills so BSAR can focus on search and rescue training.

It later served in the Philippines Campaign where in addition to night interceptor missions it also flew day and night interdiction missions against enemy troop movements, brides and other targets of opportunity. It was inactivated in 1947. History Activated on 1 April 1943. Trained at Kissimmee, Florida and trained in Douglas P-70 Havoc night fighters due to non-availability of P-61 Black Widows. By the end of training, the night fighter pilots realized that the Black Widow would not be forthcoming and resigned themselves to the fact they would be going overseas with P-70s.Northrop P-61 Black Widow‚ÄîThe Complete History and Combat Record, Garry R. Pape, John M. Campbell and Donna Campbell, Motorbooks International, 1991. The squadron was deployed to the South Pacific Theater, arriving at Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands on 15 November 1943, assigned to Thirteenth Air Force. It was the second dedicated night fighter squadron assigned to the Pacific. At Guadalcanal, the squadron absorbed Detachment B of the 6th Night Fighter Squadron. On 21 November 1943, the squadron was assigned to the 18th Fighter Group. However, it was found that the P-70 was not very successful in actual combat interception of Japanese fighters at night. It was issued P-38H Lightnings stock day fighters with no radar or any other equipment for finding the enemy at night. The Lightning pilots would wait until the enemy was over a target and, hopefully, illuminated by the defender's searchlights. They would then try to pick out the outline of the enemy aircraft and intercept. This method had its dangers since the P-38 was subjecting itself to antiaircraft fire from defenders as well as gunners aboard the Japanese bombers. The squadron received the P-61 Black Widow to replace the P-38s/P-70s in May 1944. Then on 25 August 1944, the squadron was reassigned to the XIII Fighter Command. 42-5508 flying near Noemfoor, Schouten Islands, late 1944. The squadron flew numerous missions against Japanese night intruders, which were a real nuisance to American forces and which up to this time had been virtually immune from interception. On typical missions, the pilot would be directed to the vicinity of its target by ground-based radar. The onboard A/I radar under the control of the radar operator would then be used to direct the pilot to close with and intercept the enemy. As soon as the pilot had gotten close enough to its target to make a visual identification, the guns would be aimed and fired by the pilot or by the gunner. The appearance of the Black Widow in the night skies over the Pacific was a rude and unpleasant surprise for these night raiders. Engaged the enemy during the New Guinea, Northern Solomon Islands and Bismarck Archipelago Campaigns. Moved the Philippines in 1945, operating primarily over the southern islands. During 1945 aerial targets became increasingly rare, the 419th turned to long range night-time intruding, carrying out the same mission as the aircraft they had originally been stalking ending the war being stationed on Palawan. Personnel demobilized at Clark Field and returned to the United States after the war; equipment remained in the Philippines for reclamation or sent to postwar units. Inactivated on 20 February 1947 at Puerto Princess, Palawan, Philippines as an administrative unit.

Demoxytocin is a synthetic analogue of oxytocin and has similar activities, but is more potent and has a longer half- life in comparison. Unlike oxytocin, which is given via intravenous injection, demoxytocin is administered as a buccal tablet formulation. The drug was first synthesized in 1960 and was introduced into clinical practice in 1971 by Sandoz. It is marketed in several European countries, including Italy, Czech Republic, and Poland. It has the amino acid sequence Mpa-Tyr-Ile-Gln-Asn-Cys- Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2 (Mpa = Œ≤-mercaptopropionic acid), and is an analogue of oxytocin wherein the leading cysteine is replaced with Œ≤-mercaptopropionic acid.

The Oak Grove- Freedman's Cemetery is a historic cemetery located at the corner of Liberty Street and North Church Street in downtown Salisbury, North Carolina. The cemetery has served as a burial ground for African Americans since it was deeded to the city in 1770. More than one hundred fifty known and unknown African Americans, both enslaved and free, are buried at the cemetery. The Freedman cemetery is part of a larger cemetery parcel known now as the Old English Cemetery, which is home to the graves of soldiers who died in the Battle of Camden in 1780 and to British soldiers who died in Salisbury during Cornwallis' occupation of the city. The two cemeteries were not separated physically until 1842 when a wooden fence was erected around the Old English Cemetery per the will of William Gay. This fence effectively separated the burial sites of African Americans and whites for the first time. In 1855, the fence was replaced with a granite wall, which remains standing today. Between 1903-1940, portions of the Freedman's Cemetery have been violated causing bodies to disintegrate and markers to be removed. The last standing markers were noted in 1940. The City of Salisbury assumed ownership of the cemetery in 1975, at which time the cemetery was closed to future burials. In 1998 the Waterworks Visual Arts Center, under the support of the National Endowment for the Arts and other local organizations, embarked on an eight-year effort to restore parts of the cemetery and erect a public art memorial to honor the historic site. Artist Maggie Smith and landscape architect Sam Reynolds were hired to design and create the memorial which was dedicated on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, January 16, 2006. Maggie Smith said of the project that, \\"the restoration and memorialization of the Oak Grove-Freedman's Cemetery has one primary goal: to symbolically and literally bring the desecrated part of the cemetery back into the community's embrace.\\" References Category:Cemeteries on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:Salisbury, North Carolina Category:Geography of Rowan County, North Carolina Category:Tourist attractions in Rowan County, North Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Rowan County, North Carolina ","title":"Oak Grove-Freedman's Cemetery"},{"id":"18765917","text":"Mount Kjerringa is an isolated peak, above sea level, situated roughly north of the Aker Peaks, west of Magnet Bay, and northeast of Mount Elkins in Enderby Land, East Antarctica.

Political career Silva entered politics by joining the Sri Lanka Freedom Party in Hambantota District but later joined the United National Party. At the 1994 parliamentary election Silva was elected to represent Hambantota District for the UNP. He later rejoined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. At the 2004 parliamentary election Silva was a United People's Freedom Alliance candidate in Colombo District but failed to get elected after receiving only 2,236 preference votes and coming in last place amongst the 23 UPFA candidates in the district. However, in May 2004 he was appointed as National List MP for the UPFA, replacing his wife who had resigned to allow Silva enter Parliament. In January 2007 Silva was appointed Non-Cabinet Minister of Labour. At the 2010 parliamentary election Silva was elected to represent Gampaha District for the UPFA. Afterward he was appointed Deputy Minister of Mass Media & Information. This caused strong protests from journalists because of Silva's history with the media. Reporters Without Borders described the appointment as \\"asking an arsonist to put out fires\\". Silva resigned as Deputy Minister of Mass Media & Information in May 2010 but was immediately appointed as the new Deputy Minister of Highways. On 3 August 2010 Silva subjected government official Mohammed Ishan Murshuk to public humiliation by tying him to a mango tree. Silva invited the media to witness the official's humiliation. This resulted in public outrage and demonstrations by government officials. On 10 August 2010 it was announced that Silva had been dismissed from his ministerial post and suspended from the SLFP. However, a subsequent SLFP disciplinary cleared him of all charges and on 8 September 2010 he was reappointed to his ministerial post. On 11 April 2011, Silva's Parliament Affairs Secretary Jayasena Mudiyanselage Buddhi with two Policemen in uniform and an underworld gangster who is a henchman of Silva had arrived in an official vehicle belonging to Silva, and attempted to extort five million rupees from a scrap metal businessman in Grandpass. However that businessman who happened to be a friend of the Defence Secretary got them arrested while they were threatening & demanding the kappan money from him. When things became too hot and beyond the control of Silva, he immediately disassociated all connections with Buddhi saying that his Secretary had left the employment couple of weeks before. However even if it is so Silva could not explain; how that person who had left Silva's staff managed to take the official vehicle belonging to Silva and got the two policemen released from the police station in Silva's electorate on this extortion mission two weeks later. Just after the defeat of President Rajapaksha in 2015 presidential elections (held on 08.01.15), Mervin Silva tried to distance himself from the outgoing President and hinted that he would be joining the new President. When a journalist questioned him about the switching his alliance, in front of many media personnel including the Reuters Reporter in Colombo, Silva shouted at the journalist in foul language and stated that he is not tied to anyone and whoever wins or lose he is not going to change his attitudes & behaviour.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsM-qW6X_QI Within a week after the presidential elections, Mervyn Silva and so many SLFP parliamentarians pledged their alliance to the new President Maithreepala Sirisena to retain their seats in the parliament and to stabilize their political power. Then further to be in the good books of the new president, Mervyn Silva made a complaint to the CID on 16.01.15 blaming all Rajapaksha brothers on several murders and massive scale frauds.http://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/archives/34768 http://www.hirunews.lk/101430/former-minister-mervyn-silva-lodges-complaint- at-cid-against-basil-rajapaksa-gotabaya-rajapakse Relations with media On 27 December 2007 Silva and his bodyguards stormed the offices Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation where Silva assaulted SLRC's news director T. M. G. Chandrasekera. SLRC employees then took Silva hostage and demanded he apologise. When Silva refused the SLRC employees assaulted him. Most of those SLRC employees had fled Sri Lanka and had sought asylum in other countries. On 4 August 2008 Silva and his bodyguards assaulted Sirasa TV journalist Saliya Ranawaka and cameraman Waruna Sampath and seized their equipment at the opening of a flyover at Thorana Junction in Kelaniya. Silva was tried for the assaults but was acquitted after the police failed to file any charges against him. However, earlier Silva had agreed to pay the Sirasa cameraman Rs. 750,000 compensation after the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka heard a Fundamental Rights petition filed by the cameraman.  Presence in Mega Star reality show  However Silva worked in co-operation with media during his appearance in the Swarnavahini Mega Star reality program as a judge.

The Arabica coffee industry also uses the term \\"wet hulled\\" to describe the same process.Specialty Coffee Association of Indonesia (2008) Retrieved on 2008-08-08 Most small-scale farmers in Sumatra, Sulawesi, Flores and Papua use the Giling Basah process. The mature coffee fruit, referred to as the coffee cherry, is harvested. and farmers remove the outer skin mechanically using locally built pulping machines. The coffee beans, coated with mucilage, are stored for up to a day during which a natural fermentation breaks down the sticky residue. Afterwards the coffee beans, protected by a parchment hull (endocarp) are washed off before being let out to dry. Contrary to other traditional drying methods, where the parchment coffee is dried until it reaches about 12% moisture content, the beans in the Giling Basah process are hulled when they reach between 30 and 35% moisture content; still semi-wet. The green coffee beans are then further dried to reach the exportable 12% moisture content. This operation gives the beans a unique bluish-green appearance and is thought to reduce the acidity and increase the body, resulting in the classic Indonesian cup profile.Marsh, T: \\"Review of the Aceh Coffee Industry\\", page 9.

It was established in 1997 through a unique partnership with the city of Monroe, Louisiana. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has a free 99-year lease to manage the city-owned lake. Wildlife and habitat Black Bayou Lake is studded with cypress and tupelo trees, and surrounded by swamps that graduate into bottomland hardwoods and then into upland mixed pine/hardwoods. Cherrybark oak, cedar elm, ash, hickories and willow oak dominate the lower areas while shortleaf pine, loblolly pine, mockernut hickory and post oak dominate the upland sites. Common wildlife seen include alligators, wood ducks, bird-voiced treefrogs, broad-banded water snakes, red-eared sliders, green herons, coyotes, skunks, and white-tailed deer. The refuge supports an excellent fisheries resource and provides valuable habitat for migratory waterfowl, neotropical migratory songbirds, and many resident wildlife species. Biology professors and students from the University of Louisiana at Monroe have partnered with Black Bayou Lake refuge in research projects on fishes, reptiles and amphibians. The alligator snapping turtle, a species that has declined drastically across most of the south, nests along the shores of the lake. Nest surveys are conducted annually. Reducing the raccoon population helps to prevent destruction of all the alligator snapping turtle nests and many of other turtles species. The refuge has a large nest box program for prothonotary warblers and wood ducks. Wood ducks are banded on the refuge each year. An area of of former agricultural fields has been reforested with eleven bottomland hardwood tree species. Existing forested wetlands are managed for forest health and wildlife habitat. The small upland area on the east side of the refuge is home to a remnant red-cockaded woodpecker (RCW) cluster. Some hardwoods have been removed to create preferred habitat for this endangered species. Establishing the arboretum and prairie demonstration areas required repeated plantings and waterings. Annual mowing or burning maintains the prairie area. Some of the young arboretum trees must be protected from deer and rabbits with wire cages. Control of exotic species (those not occurring naturally in this area) is a major activity on this refuge. Herbicide spraying helps to prevent water hyacinths from covering the lake. Controlling Chinese tallow trees is a matter of educating the public not to plant them as ornamental shade trees (birds disperse the seeds) and physically removing the trees, which are invading the reforested area of the refuge. Facilities The complex visitor center, a restored planter's house, is situated on the Black Bayou Lake Environmental Education Center. Adjacent to the visitor center are an arboretum with over 100 native Louisiana woody plants and a prairie demonstration area with native grasses and wildflowers. Facilities also include interactive visitor center exhibits, a mile long raised asphalt/boardwalk nature trail with wildlife pier, boat launch, amphitheater and pavilion, a raised observation deck with spotting scope and several informational kiosks. Members of Friends of Black Bayou, Inc., a refuge support group, provide thousands of hours of services for the refuge.

The general principles put it into the crazy eights family. It is played with an ordinary poker deck and the objective is for a player to empty their own hand while preventing other players from emptying theirs. The game is commonly played in South Korea and The Netherlands. Rules of play The dealer deals out seven cards for two players, or five cards for three or more players. When all players have been dealt their hands, one card is laid face-up in the middle of the table to form the discard pile, and the rest of the deck laid face-down beside it forming the stock pile. The Jokers are used. The player to the dealer's right plays first by following the rank or suit of the first card led, or by playing a wild card. If the players can not follow the lead, they must draw a card from the stock. The players then take turns playing or drawing cards and the first player who plays all his or her cards out wins the game.  Action cards  * King - Take another turn (play another card, or draw a card if none can be played). * Queen - Reverse the direction of play (in the case of two players, it functions just like a jack). * Jack - Jump (skip) the next player. * 7 - the player calls out the new suit to play. * 3 - \\"shield card\\"  Attack and defense cards  When an attack card is played, the next player must draw one or more cards, or play another attack card. * 2 - damage level of 2. * Ace - damage level of 3. * Ace of spades - damage level of 5. * Joker (black) - damage level of 7. * Joker (colored) - damage level of 10. * Three - \\"shield\\", you can block the attack card with any \\"shape\\" of three cards. Damage adds up ( followed by would have a total damage of 7). After drawing because of attack, it is still that player's turn; they may play one or more of the cards that they have just drawn. In The Netherlands their version of One-card, called Pesten, is played without shield-cards and often drop some rules to make it easier. The 8 replaces the Jack, Jack replaces the 7, 7 and King have the same function (but one is chosen at the start, mostly 7) and the Aces replaces the Queen. Children usually use rhymes to remember the rules, such as \\"Acht; wacht. Zeven; kleven.\\" (\\"Eight; wait. Seven; stick.\\") Bye  The stockpile  The stockpile is the stack of cards that have not yet gone into play. If this pile gets exhausted, and that frequently happens during the game, a player takes all but the last (top) card from the discard pile, shuffle them, to form a new stock of cards  Play variations  *A player can play more than one card at a time, but the cards must be the same rank (number or letter); in effect the suit is changed. *Two or more kings can be played, in which case the player can take yet another turn. Two or more queens are played, the effect of the second cancels the first. If two or more jacks are played, one player is skipped for each jack. *A maximum number of cards to be drawn due to a series of attack cards can be set (usually 20). *When playing against an attack card, you must play one of equal or greater value of the top card. If the player plays a card with less damage, he must draw another from the stock, and if he plays a Two on an ace, he must still draw a card. *Other reasons for penalty cards can be added. *Instead of being a shield, a 3 can be used as a mirror to return the attack to the last attacking player, also reversing the direction of play. *If a player ends on an attack card, and the attack moves through the whole circle back to them, they must pick up the cards associated with that attack (works best with two players).

The festival is still held at this location, now in August of each year.Miramichi Folksong Festival Although the festival now is an important draw for local tourism, and features some mainstream talent, the original and primary purpose of the festival is to preserve local culture; thus, highlights of the festival include many amateur, often elderly, local performers. Traditional lyrics and music highlighted by the festival have been preserved in the 1968 book Songs of Miramichi and in several recordings, including a 1962 Folkways Records album produced by Louise Manny. Allan Kelly (September 23, 1903- October 1, 2008) was one of the most popular singers and ardent supporters of the Festival. One of his earliest performances, The Petit Moine, is recorded on the 1962 album. Raymond and Frank Estey, brothers from Sevogle N.B, sang each year.

Members of these communities belong to no municipalities of their own, and thus cannot elect representatives. The Regional Council for the Unrecognized Arab Villages in the Negev (RCUV) is a grassroot civil society organization and a democratically elected body, chosen to represent the Bedouin community of the 45 unrecognized villages in the Negev. This population has been denied any representation in the local authorities, through the policies of non-recognition. The residents of each village elect a local committee, who become members of the general assembly of the RCUV. The general assembly elects the chairperson and the executive committee once every 4 years. There are 240,000 Bedouin in the Negev, of these 50% live in UV. Non recognition means that there are no national infrastructures: running water, electricity, roads and more. This situation requires the residents of the UV to provide these facilities for themselves. Israel refuses to recognize these localities for several reasons. The main reason is the planning issue‚Äîthe state would like to see the Bedouin living in the planned settlements, like Rahat and Hura. However, most of the unrecognized villages are dispersed far apart and are situated in unsuitable places, e.g., military fire zones, natural reserves, landfills, etc. Another reason is an extremely high number of land ownership claims filed by the Bedouin making it impossible to recognize all of them. Negev Bedouin claim the ownership of land totaling some , or 12 times the size of Tel Aviv. Ultimately, the state does want to recognize as many of these unrecognized settlements as possible and build infrastructure in them. Bedouin information, ILA, 2007 In 1997 inhabitants of these localities who felt the need for a representative community-based organization founded the RCUV.Patricia Golan, Built on sand, Jerusalem Report, June 26, 2012 Then the 45 participating dispersed localities had a total population of 76,000 inhabitants; these communities range in size from 500 to almost 5,000 residents. The RCUV is supposed to be an elected body, and the residents of each community (village) elect a local committee of 3-7 persons, who become members of the general assembly of the RCUV. The general assembly democratically elects the chairperson and the executive committee once every 4 years. Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre To this day, the RCUV is the only body which seeks to represent the interests of residents of the unrecognized villages. The primary goal of the RCUV is unconditional governmental recognition of the Arab Bedouin (governmentally unrecognized) villages in the Negev, which have been completely excluded from any form of governmental support or recognition. The RCUV also initiates and implements development programs; lobbies for civil rights; and advocate for the needs of its constituency. Without the RCUV there would be no such body to ensure that the basic needs and human rights of the Negev Bedouins are met. Background In order to understand the role of this organization it's important to know the background of the Negev Bedouin. Early sedentism Negev Bedouins were originally a nomadic society engaged in herding, agriculture and sometimes fishing. Traditional Bedouin lifestyle began to change after the French invasion of Egypt in 1798. At the end of the 19th century, following the need to establish law and order in the Negev, the Ottoman Empire started forcing sedentarization of the Bedouins. In 1858 a new Ottoman Land Law was issued that offered the legal grounds for the displacement of the Bedouin. Under the Tanzimat reforms the Ottoman Land Law of 1858 instituted an unprecedented land registration process. Few Bedouin opted to register their lands with the Ottoman Tapu, due to lack of enforcement by the Ottomans, illiteracy, refusal to pay taxes and lack of relevance of written documentation of ownership to the Bedouin way of life at that time.Gershon Shafir, Land, Labor and the Origins of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict 1882-1914. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press It was a fatal mistake since Israel has inherited and mainly implemented the Ottoman Land Law as the only preceding law frame. While determining the land ownership Israel relied mainly on Tabu recordings whereas most of the Bedouin land fell under the Ottoman class of 'non-workable' (mawat) land and thus belonged to the state under Ottoman law. Moreover, Israel nationalized most of the Negev lands, using The Land Rights Settlement Ordinance from 1969.(Hebrew) Dr. Tobi Fenster, A summary stance paper on Bedouin land issues, written for \\"Sikkuy - for equal opportunity\\" Israel's policies regarding the Negev Bedouin at first included regulation and re- location. During the 1950s Israel has re-located two-thirds of the Negev Bedouins into an area that was under a martial law. Bedouin tribes were concentrated in the Siyagh (Arabic for \\"the permitted area\\") triangle of Beer Sheva, Arad and Dimona.Rebecca Manski.\\"Criminalizing Self-Subsistence\\"; News from Within\\", Summer 2006 In 1966 they were given Israeli citizenship and the state has started to build planned townships for them. Government-planned townships Government-planned Bedouin township Hura's downtown Between 1968 and 1989 Israeli government established urban townships especially for the Bedouin tribes of the Negev. Within a few years, half of the Bedouin population moved into the seven townships built for them. The largest Bedouin locality in Israel is the city of Rahat, it was established in 1971. Other towns include Tel as-Sabi (Tel Sheva) (established in 1969), Shaqib al-Salam (Segev Shalom) in 1979, Ar'arat an-Naqab (Ar'ara BaNegev) and Kuseife in 1982, Lakiya in 1985 and Hura in 1989.Rebecca Manski. \\"THE NATURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE IN BEDOUIN URBAN TOWNSHIPS: THE END OF SELF-SUBSISTENCE\\"; Life and Environment, 2006 (translation from Hebrew) But not all the Bedouin desired urban life. Unrecognized villages Those Bedouin who resisted sedentarization remained in their old scattered villages which are not recognized by the Israeli government and are thus ineligible for municipal services such as connection to the electrical grid, water mains or trash- pickup.\\"Off the Map: Land and Housing Rights Violations in Israel‚Äôs Unrecognized Bedouin Villages\\"; Human Rights Watch, March 2008 Volume 20, No. 5(E). Whole report: (PDF, 5.4 MiB) Some Bedouin insist on remaining in unrecognized villages in the hope of retaining their traditions and customs. al-Sayyid Many of the unrecognized Bedouin communities were created in the 1950s when the Israeli army resettled Bedouin from the Sinai desert. Construction in them was carried out sporadically, without any centralized planning, so, for example, no place was left for the community objects, such as schools, clinics or community centers. Israeli government uses different means in order to attract the Bedouin into the planned settlements, both pleasant and unpleasant. For instance, it offers land lots at very attractive pricesIn Hura an 800 square meters land lot costs 60-65 thousand shekels ($15-16 thousand) for clan members or 22 thousand shekels ($5.5 thousand) for a demobilized soldier. Clan members‚Äô transition to the village of Houra and different bonuses. But sometimes the state is forced to implement coercive measures. Following the court order and all the legal procedure it demolishes houses built illegally on what it considers to be state lands. This is done in order to implement law and order in the Negev, as well as to build new settlements both for Jews and for the Bedouin, and improve life conditions of the Bedouin by moving them to townships with a developed infrastructure. Formation The RCUV was formed in the aftermath of 1996 events in the unrecognized village of Umm Batin. A group of local residents tried to resist government's demolition of houses built as a result of squatters' housing. During the relocation of the Bedouin and their active resistance three people were injured, including a child. Following this event, RCUV was created. It consisted of a local committee of traditional leaders joined by several \\"community professionals\\". The founders of the RCUV soon after took on developing a \\"Plan for the Development of Municipal Authority for the Arab Bedouin of the Unrecognized Villages in the Negev\\", as an alternative to the Israeli government's standard approach to relocation of residents of the unrecognized villages against their will. According to Human Rights Watch, when the Israeli Southern District Outline Plan (Tamam 4/14/2001) was first formulated, it completely ignored the existence and needs of the Bedouin in the unrecognized villages. After the Association for Civil Rights in Israel petitioned the Israeli Supreme Court in cooperation with the RCUV and the villagers it seeks to represent, the planning authorities acknowledged that Tamam had discriminated against the Bedouin. In July 2001 government planners agreed to meet with community representatives. However, Human Rights Watch says this process dragged on for over seven years, and despite some improvements, in 2008 the Plan still ignored the needs of most of the unrecognized villages.\\"Off the Map: Land and Housing Rights Violations in Israel's Unrecognized Bedouin Villages\\"; Human Rights Watch, March 2008 Establishment of Abu Basma Regional Council al-Sayyid Answering the housing need of the Negev Bedouin and as a part of the policy of step-by-step recognition of the unrecognized communities where it is possible, the State of Israel went on and initiated a creation of a new regional council whose sole purpose was to unite all the Bedouin communities that previously did not belong to other municipalities in order to solve their problems in a more organized way. On September 29, 2003 Israeli government has adapted a new \\"Abu Basma Plan\\" (Resolution 881), according to which a new Abu Basma Regional Council was formed, unifying a number of unrecognized Bedouin settlements.Beduin in Limbo The Jerusalem Post, 24 December 2007 This resolution also regarded the need to establish seven new Bedouin settlements in the Negev,Government resolutions passed in recent years regarding the Arab population of Israel Abraham Fund Initiative literally meaning the official recognition of unrecognized settlements, providing them with a municipal status and consequently with all the basic services and infrastructure. The council was established by the Interior Ministry on 28 January 2004.The Bedouin Population in Transition: Site Visit to Abu Basma Regional Council Myers-JDC-Brookdale Institute, 28 June 2005 Moreover, Israel is currently building or enlarging some 13 towns and cities in the Negev. According to the general planning, all of them will be fully equipped with the relevant infrastructure: schools, medical clinics, postal offices, etc. and they also will have electricity, running water and waste control, but it takes time. Several new industrial zones are planned, some are already being constructed, like Idan haNegev on the suburbs of Rahat.Idan Hanegev Industrial Park It will have a hospital and a new campus inside.Itamar Eichner, Harvard University makes aliyah, ynet, April 1, 2012 Prawer plan In September 2011, the Israeli government approved a five-year economic development plan called the Prawer plan.Cabinet Approves Plan to Provide for the Status of Communities in, and the Economic Development of, the Bedouin Sector in the Negev, PMO official site, September 11, 2012 One of its implications is a relocation of some 30.000-40.000 Negev Bedouin from areas not recognized by the government to government-approved townships. This will require Bedouins to leave ancestral villages, cemeteries and communal life as they know it.Al Jazeera, 13 September 2011, Bedouin transfer plan shows Israel's racismGuardian, 3 November 2011, Bedouin's plight: \\"We want to maintain our traditions. But it's a dream here\\"http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2013/06/28/a-snapshot-of-the- lives-of-the-bedouin-tribe-of-%E2%80%9Cal-araqib%E2%80%9D/ According to the PMO official press release, the plan is based on four main principles: # Providing for the status of Bedouin communities in the Negev; # Economic development for the Negev's Bedouin population; # Resolving claims over land ownership; and # Establishing a mechanism for binding, implementation and enforcement, as well as timetables. Tirabin al-Sana's mosque (its dome taken from mosque in the previous Tarabin tribe residence place next to Omer) When the cabinet approved it, simultaneously it also approved a NIS 1.2 billion economic development program for Bedouin Negev whose main purpose is to support the Bedouin women and youth in the fields of employment since the Israeli government claims they will contribute to the increased economic growth of the entire Bedouin community. Much of the approved funds will be allocated for the development of industrial zones, establishment of employment centers and professional training. This claim has been resisted by Bedouin people. According to the Prawer plan, the present Bedouin communities will undergo a comprehensive planning process. The existing communities will be expanded, some unrecognized communities will be recognized and start to receive public services, while their infrastructure will be renewed. All these changes will be done in the framework of the Beer Sheva District masterplan. Most residents will be absorbed into the Abu Basma Regional Council. While the government claims that the nature of these future communities, whether agricultural, rural, suburban or urban will be decided in full cooperation with the local Bedouin and that relocated people will receive new residences, many Bedouin people have found new homes unsustainable, destructive of their communities‚Äîand have been forced out of their homes. The Prawer plan seeks to give an answer to numerous land claims filed by the Bedouin. It will offers significant compensation in land and funds - 50% of the claim (currently it's only 20% offered), while each claim will be dealt in a unified and transparent way provided by law. It is feared by many that implementation of this plan will lead to forced relocation of the Bedouin from the unrecognized communities in spite of promises that the relocation is done in full coordination with the Bedouin and is voluntary. Other Bedouin have also been removed with less popular criticism. Good examples in this matter are Tirabin al-Sana and Segev Shalom. After a number of complicated agreements with the state all of the Bedouin of Tarabin clan moved into a township built for them - Tirabin al-Sana. Following negotiations, the Bedouin of al-'Azazme clan will take part in the planning of a new quarter that will be erected for them to west of Segev Shalom township, cooperating with The Authority for the Regulation of Bedouin Settlement in the Negev.Yanir Yagna, For the first time: Bedouin to take part in planning of their new neighborhood (Hebrew), Haaretz, July 1, 2012 Current role According to Maha Qupty (2004), a RCUV coordinator,Palestinian Grassroots Organizations: Contact information and descriptions the council builds community solidarity and mobilizes outside supporters to empower unrecognized villagers \\"to defend themselves against the onslaught of the State against their lands and livelihoods.\\" The RCUV seeks to address: # The government's treatment of 45 Bedouin villages as illegal \\"squats,\\" and its residents as \\"trespassers\\"; # The failure to extend municipal services afforded all other Israeli citizens; # The lack of community representation of the unrecognized villages in local councils, municipalities, planning and administrative bodies; # Protection from home demolitions, uprooting, land confiscation, and transfer; and # The Israeli national development plan and regional plans that ignore the existence of the villages.

Since its establishment in 1930, the hospital has grown from a small regional hospital to a world-renowned academic medical center. Duke University Hospital is the flagship teaching hospital for the Duke University Health System, a network of physicians and hospitals serving Durham County and Wake County, North Carolina, and surrounding areas, as well as one of three Level I referral centers for the Research Triangle of North Carolina (the other two are UNC Hospitals in nearby Chapel Hill and WakeMed Raleigh in Raleigh).  History = 1924‚Äì1935: early years  The institution traces its roots back to 1924, six years before the opening of the hospital, when James Buchanan Duke established the Duke Endowment to transform Duke University (then known as Trinity College) into the research university it is today. In 1925, Duke bequeathed $4 million to establish the medical school, nursing school, and hospital. Two years later, in 1927, construction began on the original hospital (now known as Duke South), which opened on July 21, 1930, with 400 beds. In 1931, the hospital and medical school were officially dedicated on April 20 and the Private Diagnostic Clinic (Duke's in-house physician system) was organized on September 16. In 1935, less than five years after the hospital opened, the American Medical Association ranked Duke among the top 20 of medical schools in the country.  1936‚Äì1969: a number of firsts  In 1936, a team of physicians led by Dr. Julian Deryl Hart introduced ultraviolet light to kill germs in the operating room as a way to combat post-operative staph infections, greatly reducing the number of infections and related deaths. In the same year, the hospital established the nation's first brain tumor program, launching what would become one of the world's most renowned programs in the field of cancer treatment. In 1937, Joseph Beard developed a vaccine against equine encephalomyelitis, one of the first known vaccines to combat the mosquito-carried disease. In 1940, the hospital made its first expansion, adding a new wing to the original building. In 1946, the Division of Thoracic Surgery, today the Duke Division of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, was organized by Josiah Charles Trent. In 1947, the Bell Research Building became the first freestanding building on the hospital campus. In 1954, the Duke Poison Control Center was organized, becoming one of the first two organized in the country. In 1955, psychiatrist Ewald W. Busse established the Duke University Center for Aging, the first research center of its kind in the nation. Currently the oldest continuously operating facility in the United States, this center has pioneered long-term studies of health problems among seniors. In 1956, Duke surgeons performed the first cardiac surgery using systemic hypothermia to bring a patient's body temperature down to less than 50 degrees Fahrenheit in an effort to minimize tissue damage during lengthy surgeries. With the success of this experiment, systemic hypothermia has become standard procedure in all hospitals worldwide. In 1957, the hospital and medical school were renamed Duke University Medical Center. In 1958, Thelma Ingles, a professor and chair of the Department of Medical-Surgical Nursing, developed the clinical nursing specialist program, becoming the first master's program of its kind in the United States. The establishment of the nursing specialist program paved the way for advanced clinical knowledge in the delivery and teaching of the nursing field. The 1960s brought extraordinary firsts to Duke. In 1963, the first African-American student was accepted to the prestigious medical school. Two years later, in 1965, the hospital established the first physician assistant program in the country. In 1966, Duke became the first medical center in the world to offer radio consultation with physicians in developing countries. This program, called Med-Aid (short for Medical Assistance for Isolated Doctors), met the critical needs of the physicians who lacked proper treatment. That same year, the Medical Scientist Training Program, a joint program leading to simultaneous M.D. and Ph.D degrees, was established, becoming one of the first three in the nation. In 1969, the first recorded studies of human's abilities to function and work at pressures equal to a 1,000-foot (300 m) deep sea dive were conducted in the hyperbaric chamber.  1970‚Äì1989: a period of growth and expansion  With the dawn of the 1970s, Duke underwent a period of expansion that continued well into the 1980s. In December 1971, the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center was established under the National Cancer Act. Duke's cancer center, one of the first in the nation under this groundbreaking legislation, was officially designated as a \\"comprehensive\\" cancer center by the National Cancer Institute in 1973. That same year, the Duke Eye Center was dedicated and opened on November 8. In 1978, the Morris Cancer Research Building opened, giving researchers a place to study and find cures for the disease. During the 1970s, the hospital also faced two distinct unionization drives aimed at uniting the unskilled service workers of Duke Hospital. The 1974 and 1978 drives both ultimately failed, and the 1980s ushered in a twenty-year low in organizing and activism at the hospital. In 1980, Duke moved into its present $94.5 million facility (Duke North) on Erwin Road, located just north of its original location. In 1985, with the emergence of AIDS bringing alarm to the medical community, Duke became one of the first two hospitals to conduct human clinical trials on AZT, the first drug to offer an improved quality of life in patients battling AIDS.  1990‚Äìpresent: accelerated growth, expansion, and a glance towards the future  In the 1990s, the medical research at Duke reached the forefront for detection of ailments that can be treated with a larger success rate. In 1990, Duke geneticists invented a three-minute test to screen newborns for over 30 metabolic diseases at one time. This practice has since become standard worldwide. In 1992, Duke's cancer center became the first hospital to develop an outpatient bone marrow transplant program. That same year, the hospital performed its first lung and heart/lung transplants. The year 1994 marked the beginning of accelerated expansion for Duke. That year, the Levine Science Research Center and the Medical Sciences Research Center were opened. In addition, there were extensive renovations of the Duke Clinic (Duke South), additions to the Morris Cancer Research Building, a new Children's Health Center, a freestanding Ambulatory Care Center, and expanded parking options for visitors. In 1998, the Duke University Health System was created with newly established partnerships with Durham Regional Hospital and Raleigh Community Hospital. That same year, the National Institutes of Health partnered with Duke to offer the first joint master's of health science in clinical research degree. With this extraordinary partnership, the NIH became the first organization to offer a joint graduate degree program with a major university. In 2001, the hospital was the first to establish a center dedicated exclusively to Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging. In 2019, a team at the hospital became the first in the United States to transplant an adult heart into a recipient through a process known as donation after circulatory death. Duke University Hospital is still seeking life-changing breakthroughs to improve the quality of life for everyone in the world. In 2019, the hospital began a major expansion project in 2019 that will increase expand the emergency department.

Despite the fact that the novel was written later, it is considered to be an indirect prequel to the novel Genome. It takes place in the same fictional universe as Genome, about one hundred years prior to the novel's time frame. Unlike Genome, Dances on the Snow hardly deals with the issue of genetic engineering but does touch on the issue of cloning. However, the biggest focus is the problems of free choice and mind control.  Plot  Tikkirey \\"Tiki\\" Frost lives on the planet Quarry, poorly adapted for human life and stricken with poverty. Due to the planet's high radioactivity, the inhabitants of Quarry are forced to live in a protective dome and pay for food and air, or \\"social support\\". Unemployment is a major problem on Quarry. In fact, one's ability to obtain a job depends on the quality of his or her neuroshunt implant, allowing direct mind-to-machine connection. Tikkirey's parents' neuroshunts have become obsolete and they have no money for an upgrade. His father has been unemployed for years, and his mother makes a pittance. Incapable of paying for their social support, Tikkirey's parents are forced to invoke their \\"constitutional right to commit suicide.\\" For that, Tikkirey's social support is extended by 7 years, during which he can get education and find a job, as his neuroshunt is above the local standard. If his parents forgo their \\"constitutional right\\", the entire family will be evicted from the Dome. The life expectancy outside the Dome is 1‚Äì2 years. After losing his parents, Tikkirey decides to leave Quarry by any means necessary. As such, he signs up on an interstellar ore transport as a \\"calculation module\\" ‚Äî a wetware computer used for complex calculations at faster-than-light speeds, as normal computers fail to work. A calculation module remains in suspended animation, most of the time, while a stream of data is shunted through his brain. While this is a highly paid position, continuous misuse of the brain atrophies the frontal lobe, causing the person to lose his free will. After the expiration of the standard five-year contract, 97% of calculation modules are incapable of making their own decisions and continue flying for the rest of their lives. The other 3% manage to muster enough willpower to leave the ship (2%) or cancel the contract before time is up (1%); however, even they have to spend years relearning to make even the simplest decisions (e.g. a simple choice of soft drink is an extremely difficult process for them). After regaining consciousness on the beautiful and wealthy planet of New Kuwait, Tikkirey demands to cancel his contract and leave the ship. He immediately finds out that a clause in the contract prevents him from doing just that, as he must pay off his 150,000 credit insurance policy, which will require Tikkirey to serve another 1.5 years on the ship. The contract is specifically written to prevent calculation modules from using ships as free rides. Fortunately, Tikkirey finds out that the crew took pity on the boy and broke the law by not getting him an insurance policy. He receives his earned credits and leaves the ship. He then takes a taxi and gets a room at a cheap hotel. He then hits another snag: his money will only last him about a week. New Kuwait's laws require local permanent residency for employment, but the process of obtaining it takes at least six months. At the hotel, Tikkirey meets Lion, a boy his age, who was born and grew up on a space station. The next day, Tikkirey encounters and befriends a mysterious man named Captain Stas, who turns out to be a phage from the planet Avalon. Phages are knight-like members of an organization whose goal is to rid the Empire of its enemies. Unlike the rational humans around them, phages are encouraged to listen with their hearts. A phage is genetically engineered to be stronger and faster than any normal human. He is capable of using something called an \\"imperative voice\\", causing most humans to follow his instructions without question (similar to the Voice from Frank Herbert's novel Dune). A phage's weapon of choice is a multi-functional semi- intelligent plasma whip, chosen not for its deadliness but for its psychological effect. The phages' mission, abilities, and moral code have earned them the nickname \\"jedi\\", which they tend to dislike, as it trivializes the phages' purpose. Stas is on a mission to investigate the suspicious activity on New Kuwait of agents from the planet Iney (\\"frost\\" in Russian). Iney has already \\"peacefully\\" allied with several other Imperial worlds and is gaining in strength, threatening the stability of the Empire. Before Stas or Tikkirey can do anything, most of the population of New Kuwait suddenly falls asleep. Tikkirey and Stas are one of the few still awake. Stas takes the boy and, at Tikkirey's request, the unconscious Lion with him on his ship. They are able to launch before the population awakes and announces its allegiance with Iney. With some quick thinking, Tikkirey connects Lion's brain to the datastream of the ship, temporarily turning him into a calculation module. The plan works, and Lion awakes shortly after. However, his free will is gone. Stas takes the boys to his home planet of Avalon, where the phages' headquarters are located. Tikkirey is hired by the phages to work in support role, while he takes care of Lion. Basically, Tikkirey is forced to tell Lion to do almost everything, hoping that he may one day get better. He also makes friends with his neighbors, a brother and a sister of a slightly younger age. One day, Tikkirey is asked by his supervisor to destroy a faulty plasma whip, which refuses to bond with any phage. To Tikkirey's surprise, the whip bonds to him, and he refuses to destroy the semi-living device. That same day, his neighbors invite him and Lion to go camping at a nearby lake. Since it is wintertime in that part of Avalon, the lake is frozen over. The teenagers (except for Lion) begin to ice skate, but ice cracks under Tikkirey, and he falls into the water. He attempts to get out by using the whip but to no avail. Surprisingly, Lion snaps out of his daze and saves Tikkirey. Stas arrives with paramedics and explains that the whip was a test of loyalty, which Tikkirey has failed. Tikkirey shows that the whip bonded to him, which surprises the phage, as this has never happened before. Tikkirey and Lion are taken to the phage headquarters, where Lion is given a clean bill of health by a psychiatrist. Lion explains that, during the time he was asleep, he has lived an entire lifetime as a citizen of Iney. The boys find out that the phages are planning on sending them back to New Kuwait to conduct an investigation as to how Iney is controlling the population. Tikkirey and Lion are dropped in a pod made of a special form of ice, which melts on landing, leaving no trace. However, the boys are quickly captured by a team of girls armed with crossbows. They are escorted to their base camp, where Tikkirey encounters a disabled old man he met while escaping from New Kuwait. The girls are members of a former hip hop dancing troupe who have become guerrilla fighters. They help the boys sneak into the city, where Lion is reunited with his family, who all behave like a stereotypical perfect TV family. Tikkirey and Lion are sent to a boarding school \\"to learn to serve the society better.\\" Everything appears to be going well, except that the boys know they are under surveillance. One night, the old man's daughter Natasha sneaks into their room and informs them that Iney counter-intelligence is following their every move. They decide to escape and hide in a school located in a poor district. They are able, for a time, to remain undetected by the Iney. Once, however, Natasha introduces Tikkirey to another girl, who claims to also be an agent for the phages. She informs Tikkirey that a wealthy Imperial industrialist has arrived on New Kuwait and that he is secretly working with Iney against the Empire. The girl orders Tikkirey to execute the industrialist and his teenage daughter. While morally disagreeing with the girl, Tikkirey decides to go through with it. Tikkirey, Lion, and Natasha sneak into the villa where the industrialist is being treated as an honored guest. However, upon attempting to ambush the man and his daughter, Tikkirey is surprised to learn that the industrialist is, in fact, Stas in disguise. His \\"daughter\\" is a young phage- in-training dressed as a girl. The real industrialist has been detained by the Imperial forces, and the phages have been sent in their stead. Stas immediately realizes that the girl who gave the execution order is an Iney agent, which means that their cover is blown. He decides to attempt to smuggle Tikkirey, Lion, and Natasha from New Kuwait in suitcases. There is one problem, however ‚Äî due to a quirk of nature, FTL travel is lethal to human females (the reasoning behind this is not explained, although it is mentioned that a Y-chromosome is necessary to survive an FTL jump). As such, Natasha must be placed into a cryogenic pod. Due to the shortage of space on the luxury transport, the dock workers decide to leave Tikkirey's suitcase in storage to be sent with the next ship. An old female dockworker decides to look inside and finds the boy. Instead of reporting him, however, the old lady feeds him and asks him to tell her what is happening. After hearing his story, Tikkirey asks her to contact Stas and tell him to freeze Natasha. When she comes back, the lady begins to explain certain unknown facts to Tikkirey. She explains that the president of Iney, a woman by the name of Inna Snow, is, in fact, a clone. At one point in time, a genetic genius named Edward Garlitsky has decided to fundamentally alter humanity for the better. For this purpose, he cloned himself into a woman named Ada Snezhinskaya, but their views on the means of achieving the change were radically different: Edward wanted to act behind-the-scenes (according to the novel Genome, he became the father of specification), while Ada wanted to directly alter the current social and political structure of the Empire. For that purpose, Ada created thousands of clones of herself and of Edward and spread them throughout the Empire (at that time, it was common practice for parents to buy fetuses). The first names of the female clones were always four letters long with a double consonant in the middle, while the last name was in some way related to snow (e.g. Inna Snow, Anna Neige). Sooner or later, most of the clones were tracked down and offered to have the collective memory of the clones imprinted on them. Most agreed. They all began to set themselves up in certain key political positions. Eventually, Inna Snow discovered a way of using neuroshunts to slowly download a dormant program into people's brains. A certain signal would then trigger the program, which would allow the affected people to live out entire lifetimes in their heads. While each person's \\"dream life\\" was different, several constants remained the same: Inna Snow and Iney are good, the Empire and the Emperor are bad. The medium for implanting the program was chosen to be the many TV series produced on Iney and watched throughout the Empire. After hearing this, Tikkirey realizes that the old lady is Ada Snezhinskaya, who reveals that Tikkirey Frost is himself a clone of Edward Garlitsky. Despite this realization, Tikkirey attempts to kill Ada with a whip, but he only wounds her and gets captured by Iney forces. Finding himself in a prison cell with Stas, the phage-in-training, Lion, Natasha, and her grandfather, Tikkirey questions Stas and finds out that Stas knew about him being a clone. The group is then taken to a factory to meet Ada and Inna, where, after a verbal joust, Stas reveals that the Empire has begun a massive invasion of all Iney-occupied worlds, using a modified version of Inna Snow's program to remove Iney's propaganda from the affected people's minds. In a last-ditch effort to save herself and her plan, Ada uses the imperative voice to order Tikkirey and Natasha to jump off the catwalk into a pool of strong solvent. Natasha's grandfather sacrifices himself to save his granddaughter and push both Ada and Inna off the catwalk. Stas uses his own imperative voice to override Ada's order and frees the teenagers. With the threat of Iney gone and the clones in custody, Stas offers to take Tikkirey back to Avalon. However, Tikkirey first makes a stop at Quarry to get two of his friends off that rock. As a side note, he mentions that a genetic cure has been found to allow women to safely traverse FTL hyperchannels without the use of cryogenics.

Leonard and starring Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas. The screenplay concerns a woman who pretends to be married to fend off would-be suitors and jealous wives, then regrets her deception when she meets an artist. Plot New York magazine editor Margot Sherwood \\"Merrick\\" (Myrna Loy) invents a husband (who is conveniently away in remote corners of the world) mainly to safeguard her job; the magazine publisher's jealous wife has had the last two women in her position fired after mere months. It also comes in handy keeping aggressive men at bay, as Margot is determined to succeed in her career. Magazine photographer August Winkel (Felix Bressart) helps by writing letters supposedly from \\"Tony Merrick\\". One day, she goes to meet a friend arriving on a passenger ship. However, when she enters her friend's cabin, she finds some paintings, but no friend. Soon after, art dealer Mr. Flandrin (Donald Meek) shows up to examine the works. Irritated by Flandrin's brusk attitude and certain that she can get a better deal for her friend, Margot orders him to leave. However, Margot's friend had gotten off at a prior stop, and the paintings actually belong to Jeff Thompson (Melvyn Douglas). Jeff runs into Flandrin on deck, only to learn that the insulted dealer is no longer interested in selling his artwork. When Jeff confronts Margot, she promises to straighten things out. Masquerading as an enthusiastic rival dealer, she manipulates Flandrin into offering Jeff a much better deal than he had ever expected. Mollified, Jeff offers to take her out to dinner to celebrate. She declines, but when her lawyer boyfriend Philip Booth (Lee Bowman) has to cancel their date, she changes her mind. At the nightclub, a drunken acquaintance spots Margot and mentions her husband, forcing Margot to improvise and tell Jeff that it was merely a passing infatuation in Rio de Janeiro. He believes her at first, but then some inconsistencies in her story cause him to check up on her; he concludes that there is no Tony Merrick. To teach her a lesson, he shows up at her family mansion and announces to her father (Raymond Walburn), younger sister (Bonita Granville), and butler (Halliwell Hobbes) that he is Tony. He is welcomed with open arms. Margot has no choice but to go along with the deception. The next morning, she confesses all to Philip in order to get some legal advice. Philip tells her she cannot \\"divorce\\" a man to whom she is not even married. He suggests she first marry him discreetly, then divorce him publicly. Philip convinces a reluctant Jeff to go along. The couple head off to Niagara Falls to get married. At the falls, Jeff runs into some friends from his Ohio hometown, Wapakoneta. Margot takes the opportunity to exact some revenge, pretending to be a very uncouth wife, complete with an exaggerated New York accent. Margot, Jeff, and Philip then board a train to drop Jeff off in Ohio. Margot and Philip plan to go on to Reno to secure the divorce, then get married themselves. However, Jeff starts having second thoughts. To buy time, he hires African-American train porter Sam (who has been studying law by correspondence) to draw out the property settlement negotiations. It works. When Jeff gets off the train, Margot goes with him.

In health care facilities, isolation represents one of several measures that can be taken to implement infection control: the prevention of communicable diseases from being transmitted from a patient to other patients, health care workers, and visitors, or from outsiders to a particular patient (reverse isolation). Various forms of isolation exist, in some of which contact procedures are modified, and others in which the patient is kept away from all other people. In a system devised, and periodically revised, by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), various levels of patient isolation comprise application of one or more formally described \\"precaution\\". Isolation is most commonly used when a patient is known to have a contagious (transmissible from person-to- person) viral or bacterial illness. Special equipment is used in the management of patients in the various forms of isolation. These most commonly include items of personal protective equipment (gowns, masks, and gloves) and engineering controls (positive pressure rooms, negative pressure rooms, laminar air flow equipment, and various mechanical and structural barriers). Dedicated isolation wards may be pre-built into hospitals, or isolation units may be temporarily designated in facilities in the midst of an epidemic emergency. Isolation should not be mistaken as the same as quarantine or biocontainment. Quarantine is the compulsory separation and confinement, with restriction of movement, of healthy individuals or groups who have potentially been exposed to an agent to prevent further infections should infection occur. Biocontainment refers to laboratory biosafety in microbiology laboratories in which the physical containment (BSL-3, BSL-4) of highly pathogenic organisms is accomplished through built-in engineering controls.  Importance  Contagious diseases can spread to others through various forms. Four types of infectious disease transmission can occur: (1) contact transmission, which can be through direct physical contact, indirect contact through fomites, or droplet contact in which airborne infections spread short distances, (2) vehicular transmission, which involves contaminated objects, (3) airborne transmission, which involves spread of infectious particles through air, and (4) vector transmission, which is spread through insects or animals. Depending on the contagious disease, transmission can occur within a person's home, school, worksite, health care facility, and other shared spaces within the community. Even if a person takes all necessary precautions to protect oneself from disease, such as being up-to-date with vaccines and practicing good hygiene, he or she can still get sick. Some people may not be able to protect themselves from diseases and may develop serious complications if they contract the disease. Therefore, disease isolation is an important infection prevention and control practice used to protect others from disease. Disease isolation can prevent healthcare-acquired infections of hospital-acquired infections (HCAIs), reduce threats of antibiotic resistance infections, and respond to new and emerging infectious disease threats globally.  Types of precautions  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) created various levels of disease isolation (also described \\"precaution\\"). These precautions are also reviewed and revised by the CDC.  Universal/standard  Universal precautions refer to the practice, in medicine, of avoiding contact with patients' bodily fluids, by means of the wearing of nonporous articles such as medical gloves, goggles, and face shields. The practice was widely introduced in 1985‚Äì88. In 1987, the practice of universal precautions was adjusted by a set of rules known as body substance isolation. In 1996, both practices were replaced by the latest approach known as standard precautions. Use of personal protective equipment is now recommended in all health settings.  Transmission-based  Transmission-based precautions are additional infection control precautions ‚Äì over and above universal/standard precautions ‚Äì and the latest routine infection prevention and control practices applied for patients who are known or suspected to be infected or colonized with infectious agents, including certain epidemiologically important pathogens. The latter require additional control measures to effectively prevent transmission.There are three types of transmission-based precaution: *Contact precautions are intended to prevent transmission of infectious agents, including epidemiologically important microorganisms, which are spread by direct or indirect contact with the patient or the patient's environment. *Droplet precautions are intended to prevent transmission of pathogens spread through close respiratory or mucous membrane contact with respiratory secretions. *Airborne precautions prevent transmission of infectious agents that remain infectious over long distances when suspended in the air (e.g., rubeola virus [measles], varicella virus [chickenpox], M. tuberculosis, and possibly SARS-CoV).  Isolation  According to the CDC, isolation is the act of separating a sick individual with a contagious disease from healthy individuals without that contagious disease in order to protect the general public from exposure of a contagious disease. Special equipment is used in the management of patients in the various forms of isolation. These most commonly include items of personal protective equipment (gowns, masks, and gloves) and engineering controls (positive pressure rooms, negative pressure rooms, laminar air flow equipment, and various mechanical and structural barriers). Dedicated isolation wards may be pre-built into hospitals, or isolation units may be temporarily designated in facilities in the midst of an epidemic emergency. Many forms of isolation exist. Contact isolation is used to prevent the spread of diseases that can be spread through contact with open wounds. Health care workers making contact with a patient on contact isolation are required to wear gloves, and in some cases, a gown. Respiratory isolation is used for diseases that are spread through particles that are exhaled. Those having contact with or exposure to such a patient are required to wear a mask. The Aeromedical Biological Containment System (ABCS) is an air-transportable high isolation module for movement of highly contagious patients. Reverse isolation is a way to prevent a patient in a compromised health situation from being contaminated by other people or objects. It often involves the use of laminar air flow and mechanical barriers (to avoid physical contact with others) to isolate the patient from any harmful pathogens present in the external environment. High isolation is used to prevent the spread of unusually highly contagious, or high consequence, infectious diseases (e.g., smallpox, Ebola virus). It stipulates mandatory use of: (1) gloves (or double gloves if appropriate), (2) protective eyewear (goggles or face shield), (3) a waterproof gown (or total body Tyvek suit, if appropriate), and (4) a respirator (at least FFP2 or N95 NIOSH equivalent), not simply a surgical mask. Sometimes negative pressure rooms or powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) are also used. Strict isolation is used for diseases spread through the air and in some cases by contact. Patients must be placed in isolation to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Those who are kept in strict isolation are often kept in a special room at the facility designed for that purpose. Such rooms are equipped with a special lavatory and caregiving equipment, and a sink and waste disposal are provided for workers upon leaving the area. =Self- isolation= Traffic sign in South Carolina encouraging people to 'stay home' during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-isolation, seclusion or home isolation is the act of quarantining oneself to prevent infection of oneself or others, either voluntarily or to comply with relevant regulations or guidance. The practice became notable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Key features are: :* staying at home :* separating oneself from other peoplefor example, trying not to be in the same room as other people at the same time :* asking friends, family members or delivery services to carry out errands, such as getting groceries, medicines or other shopping :* asking delivery drivers to leave items outside for collection. The Irish Health Service Executive recommends regularly monitoring symptoms and not disposing of rubbish until the self- isolation ends, warning also that \\"self-isolation can be boring or frustrating. It may affect your mood and feelings. You may feel low, worried or have problems sleeping. You may find it helps to stay in touch with friends or relatives by phone or on social media.\\" The UK Government states that anyone who is self-isolating should \\"not go to work, school, or public areas, and do not use public transport or taxis. Nobody should go out even to buy food or other essentials, and any exercise must be taken within your home\\".Public Health England, Stay at home: guidance for households with possible or confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) infection, updated 18 June 2020, accessed 5 July 2020 As of March 2020 UK employers may provide sick pay to support self-isolation. Citizens Advice says that people on zero-hours contracts can also receive sick pay. For the purposes of people who have traveled to the UK, \\"self-isolate\\" and \\"self-isolation\\" are legally defined terms whose meaning is set out in the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) Regulations 2020.UK Legislation, Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) Regulations 2020, SI 2020/568, Regulation 4(2), made 2 June 2020, accessed 5 July 2020  Isolation of health care workers  Isolation wards may need to be hastily improvised during epidemics such as in this image of WHO workers in Lagos, Nigeria managing Ebola patients in 2014. Disease isolation is relevant to the work and safety of health care workers. Health care workers may be regularly exposed to various types of illnesses and are at risk of getting sick. Disease spread can occur between a patient and a health care worker, even if the health care workers take all necessary precautions to minimize transmission, including proper hygiene and being up-to-date with vaccines. If a health care worker gets sick with a communicable disease, the possible spread may occur to other health care workers or susceptible patients within the health care facility. This can include patients with a weakened immune system and may be at risk for serious complications. Health care workers who become infected with certain contagious agents may not be permitted to work with patients for a period of time. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has implemented several standards and directives applicable to protecting health care workers from the spread of infectious agents. These include bloodborne pathogens, personal protective equipment, and respiratory protections. The CDC has also released resource for health care facilities to assist in assessing and reducing risk for occupational exposure to infectious diseases. The purpose of these standards and guidelines is to prevent the spread of disease to others in a health care facility.  Consequences  Disease isolation is rarely disputed for its importance in protecting others from disease. However, it is important to consider the consequences disease isolation may have on an individual. For instance, patients may not be able to receive visitors, and in turn, become lonely. Patients may experience depression, anxiety, and anger. Small children may feel their isolation is a punishment. Staff may need to spend more time with patients. Patients may not be able to receive certain types of care due to the risk that other patients may become contaminated. This includes forms of care that involve use of equipment common to all patients at the facility, or that involve transporting the patient to an area of the facility common to all patients. Given the impact of isolation on patients, social and emotional support may be needed. Although a majority of health care professionals advocate for disease isolation as an effective means of reducing disease transmission, some health care professionals are concerned with implementing such control protocols given the possible negative consequences on patients. Patients isolated with Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) can also be negatively impacted by having less documented care/bedside visits from attending and residents.  Ethics  The new Ebola isolation ward in Lagos, Nigeria provides more space and better treatment. Disease isolation serves as an important method to protect the general community from disease, especially in a hospital or community-wide outbreak. However, this intervention poses an ethical question on rights of the individual versus rights of the general community. Infectious diseases, including isolation precaution measures, are generally not considered a primary topic of importance in the field of bioethics in comparison to other topics such as euthanasia, assisted reproduction, and genetics. Possible reasons as to why infectious diseases are not viewed as a primary topic in medical ethics include the following: bias for topics that are more high-tech, wealthy-world topics such as euthanasia and assisted reproduction, blinding optimism that infectious diseases are no longer a threat because of the success of antibiotics and vaccines, and the labeling of \\"other\\" among certain infectious diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, Ebola, etc. In cases of disease outbreaks, isolation can be argued as an ethical and necessary precaution for protecting the community from further disease transmission. This can be seen during the 2014 Disneyland measles outbreak and 2014 Ebola outbreak. This can be justified using felicific calculus to predict the outcomes (consequences) of moral action between the individual rights versus the rights of the general public during disease isolation. This justifies that disease isolation is most likely to result in the greatest amount of positive outcomes for the largest number of people. Disease isolation can also be justified as a morally legitimate ethical practice in public health based on the reciprocal relationship between the individual and the state. The individual is obligated to protect others by preventing further spread of disease, respect the instructions from public health authorities and sequester themselves in their homes and not attend public gatherings, and act as a first responder (if a healthcare professional) by providing services to protect and restore public health. The state, on the other hand, is obligated to provide support to individuals burdened as a result of restrictive measures (e.g. compensation for missed work, providing access to food and other necessities for those quarantined and isolated, assistance for first responders to balance personal/professional obligations), ensure several legal protections are in place for those subjected to restrictive measures and communicate all relevant information regarding the necessity of restriction.

Stocks are typically traded in increments of 100 shares, a quantity known as a round lot or board lot. The cost of 100 shares of a security may be beyond the means of an individual investor, or may represent a larger investment than the investor wishes to make. Thus, the investor purchases an odd lot.Investopedia definition of odd lotterInvestopedia definition of round lotInvestopedia definition of odd lot  Odd lot theory  Odd lotters were central to a historical theory of technical analysis known as odd lot theory. Odd lot theory was predicated on the belief that one could outperform the stock market by identifying the least-informed investors and making investments opposite to them. (If the least-informed investors were selling, it was generally a good time to buy, and vice versa.) Assuming that odd lotters were generally smaller investors with little market knowledge, practitioners of odd lot theory identified the actions of odd lotters and did the opposite. The actions of odd lotters were interpreted as contrary signals.Investopedia definition of Odd lot theory The theory is no longer popularBloomberg.com glossary entry for Odd lot theory as analysis of data shows little evidence that the method works. According to Princeton University economist Burton Malkiel: \\"It turns out that the odd- lotter isn't such a stupendous dodo after all. A little stupid? Maybe. There is some indication that the performance of odd-lotters might be slightly worse than the stock averages.

Plot Bitter war widow Janet Ames (Rosalind Russell) seeks out the five soldiers for whom her husband gave his life by falling on a hand grenade during the Battle of the Bulge. While crossing a city street to find the first, she is struck and knocked unconscious by an automobile. The police find no identification on her, only a list of names. One recognizes the last name on her list, Smithfield \\"Smitty\\" Cobb (Melvyn Douglas), a reporter recently fired for alcoholism, and contacts Smitty. When Smitty sees the list, he realizes who she must be. He goes to see her at the hospital, and finds her in a wheelchair, unable to walk. As the doctor can find no physical reason for the paralysis, he schedules an appointment with a psychiatrist. Smitty decides to treat her himself. He introduces himself as a friend of her husband David (though not as one of the men he saved), and wheels her into a private room. She explains her mission: to see if any of the men were worth David's sacrifice, making it perfectly clear that she has already made up her mind. After a nurse gives her a sedative, Smitty accuses her of wallowing in self- pity, then tries to get Janet to change her mind by describing each of the men. He is so vivid that Janet can see and talk to them. The first man she interacts with is nightclub bouncer Joe Burton (Richard Benedict). He and his singer girlfriend Katie (Betsy Blair) dream of building a house. Joe constructs a model of it from a deck of cards. Exasperated by their unrealistic aspirations, Janet blows the cards down. Next, Smitty takes her to the desert, where Ed Pierson is doing scientific research and living in a shack with his wife Susie (Nina Foch). Janet does not meet Ed at all; instead, she talks with Susie and her very wealthy father, who strongly disapproves of what the couple are doing. He wants Ed to come work for him, but Susie replies that Ed is happy where he is and would be miserable in the business world. Janet states that her husband would never do what Ed has done. The third man is Frank Merino (played by an uncredited Hugh Beaumont). Janet first meets his young daughter Emmy. During their conversation, Janet states that she and David were too sensible to have children before they were ready and that children are a lot of trouble. A bewildered Emmy seeks comfort from her father. Sammy Weaver (Sid Caesar), the fourth man, is a promising, up-and- coming comedian. After entertaining Janet and Smitty with his routine, he thanks her for the opportunity to lift the spirits of his audience. By this point, Janet has guessed Smitty's identity. He describes himself as a crusading journalist and newspaper editor. Janet then admits that she feels overwhelming guilt in not loving her husband and making his civilian life so miserable, he had little to lose when he sacrificed himself. David wanted to build a house and have a child right away, but she put them off until it was too late. She also made him decline a research position and keep working at a job he hated for her own security. Smitty persuades her to forgive herself, and the paralysis in her legs goes away. However, when she tells him that she has fallen in love with him, he brushes her off and retreats to his favorite bar to drown his own troubles. Janet then learns from a policeman that Smitty is not exactly what he claimed. She tracks him down and extracts from him the reason for his alcoholism. It turns out Smitty, as David's commanding officer, ordered him to throw himself on the grenade, when Smitty was just as close to it. Janet tells him that David would have done so without being ordered, and that he probably never even heard the command. She then turns the tables on her healer, describing their happy future life together.

John Wallace Dickenson (born 22 January 1934) is an Australian inventor, who developed some liquid flow measuring devices and designed a successful hang glider configuration, for which he was awarded with the Gold Air Medal, the highest award given by the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale, the world governing body for air sports, aeronautics and astronautics world records. Ski kite NASA's Paresev glider in flight with tow cable (1962). In 1963, after seeing an image of a Rogallo wing airfoil on a magazine, Dickenson set to build a water skiing kite that could be released at altitude for a glide to a safe drop in the water, thus designed and built a water skiing kite wing he called the Ski Kite. His ski kite format incorporated an airframe with a triangle control frame as used in hang gliding in Breslau 1908, having a basebar tow-point and was integrated on an all-ready publicized four-boom stiffened Rogallo wing airfoil, where the pilot sat on a swinging seat while the control frame and wire bracing distributed the load to the wing as well as giving a frame to brace for weight-shift control. Dickenson's Ski Wing turned out to be stable and controllable, unlike the flat manned kites used at water ski shows.Stability and weight-shift control are inherent flex-wing characteristics previously established and described by its inventor Francis Rogallo and by NASA engineers in the Paresev and Fleep programs. The Ski Wing was first flown in public at the 'Grafton Jacaranda Festival', New South Wales, Australia, in September 1963 by Rod Fuller while towed behind a motorboat. The ski kite he now called Ski Wing, was light and portable, so Dickenson decided to file for a mechanical patent, but lacking on economic resources, the patent process of formal review of claims could not be entered to determine which, if any, of the claims could hold, so the patent was not awarded.On October/11/1963, Dickenson filed for a patent, and a provisional protection was awarded for his application number 36189/63 but the patent was not awarded: Glider versions= Half scale prototype Produced in 1963 Mark I Produced on 8 September 1963.

Australia.Footage: , Interview: Legacy A basic hang glider flying over the Alps (2006) Dickenson's hang glider format was further developed by other builders and directly helped to build the popularity of hang gliding around the world in the 1970s and 1980s. It is certain that many people from many countries, made contributions to the development of the flexible wing hang glider to the extent that any global mechanical claim for invention would be untenable. In the aviation context of 'first flights' and recreational vs. commercial developments, new and old inventions often complement in synergy; it is in this evolutionary and social context that the crucial developments put together John Dickenson, were the ones that were most successful and influential on the evolution of hang gliders. John Dickenson was a ski-kite pilot; he never foot-launched a hang glider.

It was manned principally by Royal Canadian Artillery (RCA) and Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) personnel, with select British artillery pilots briefly seconded to assist in squadron formation. Numbers 651 to 663 Squadrons of the RAF were Air Observation Post units working closely with Army units in artillery spotting and liaison. A further three of these squadrons ‚Äì Nos. 664, 665 and 666 ‚Äì were RCAF AOP squadrons manned by Canadian and British personnel. History=Formation A postwar Auster Mk.V, restored in wartime colours The squadron was formed on 22 January 1945 at RAF Andover as an RCAF unit ‚Äì albeit not in the 'Article XI' sequence of squadron numbers, but in a 'normal' British sequence ‚Äì its principal role being to direct artillery fire from the air. The pilots were officers recruited from the Royal Canadian Artillery and trained to fly at 22 E.F.T.S. (Elementary Flying Training School) Cambridge, further developing advanced flying skills at 43 Operational Training Unit RAF (43 OTU), RAF Andover. The first commanding officer was Major Dave Ely, RCA. The operational commanding officer selected to take the squadron to war was Captain G.A. 'Tony' Eaton, MC, RCA; Eaton was killed in a flying mishap near RAF Middle Wallop on the night of 1 March 1945. Major Norbert Reilander, RCA, from No. 664 Squadron RCAF, was chosen to take command of 665 Squadron in the first week of March 1945. The squadron operated in England under the overall control of No. 70 Group, RAF Fighter Command; prior to deployment to the European continent the squadron was transferred to No. 84 Group, RAF Second Tactical Air Force (2 TAF). On operations The squadron began deploying to the Netherlands on 19 April, arriving at B-77 Gilze-Rijen airport on 21 April 1945. The principal aircraft flown in action was the Taylorcraft Auster Mk.V. 'B' Flight of 665 (AOP) Squadron, RCAF, was credited with firing the last Canadian shot of the war in Europe at Dunkirk, France, on 7 May 1945. After V-E Day on 8 May 1945, the squadron was tasked with flying mail and passengers for First Canadian Army, while one section and its aircraft was seconded to Allied Headquarters at Frankfurt, Germany, for U.S. Intelligence duties. No. 665 (AOP) Squadron, RCAF, was disbanded at 'JOE' airfield, Apeldoorn, the Netherlands, on 10 July 1945. The squadron had no official motto or heraldic badge assigned to it. Aircrew or not? Formation of the three Canadian war-time A.O.P. squadrons was historically the first example of 'unification of services,' a generation before the Canadian Forces experienced total unification. These, however, were not 'co-operation squadrons.' Although 665 squadron's trained aircrew observers acquitted themselves admirably in aerial action against the enemy, aircrew associations across Canada did not grant membership to AOP observers, as those aircrew were not officially issued with cloth wings during the war.

Early life  Paris was born Richard Lee on November 11, 1971 in Winnipeg, Manitoba and was raised in a strict, middle-class household. His family is mixed-race; his mother was from Singapore and his father from Trinidad & Tobago. After his father's business failed, his parents moved to British Columbia, leaving Paris and his brother to live with their grandmother while they finished high school in Winnipeg. During high school, Paris began struggling with depression, a condition he attributed to early- childhood sexual abuse by a neighbor. However, he excelled at art and music and, by age 13, he had attained his black belt in Taekwondo.  1989‚Äì1993: Young entrepreneur  After graduating from high school in 1989, Paris studied Criminology with the intent of becoming a police officer but dropped out of college to start a T-shirt company called \\"Express Clothing\\". He started selling T-shirts out of the trunk of his car and the business flourished, to the point where the line was carried by some of Canada's largest clothing companies, however Paris was unable to keep up with production requirements and the company folded in its third year. This, combined with a break-up with a long-time girlfriend, led to a suicide attempt; when he recovered, he decided to join his parents in British Columbia.  1994‚Äì1998: Multimedia career & depression  Paris' father had formed a multimedia company in Surrey and Brandon joined the company, spending the next seven years as a digital video editor and animator. As the company grew, the effects of over-work, anxiety and the onset of Type 2 diabetes caused him to turn to medication and illicit drugs. By 1998, he had become addicted to Methamphetamine and MDMA. This led to a deep depression, but depression helped him re-discover his love for music, and find his voice. He started writing songs and singing at parties, and the encouragement received from his audiences helped him beat his addiction. Also at this time, the Fitness World chain used Paris in its advertisements as a 'success story'. In 1998, he legally changed his name, choosing 'Brandon' because his idol, martial artist Bruce Lee, had named his son Brandon, and 'Paris' because it was more marketable than 'Lee'.  1999‚Äì2006: Music career & debut album  In 1999 Paris moved to Long Beach, California, with $7,000 cash and hopes of putting together a band. He took vocal lessons and educated himself on the music industry but was not successful at establishing himself. He ran out of money and illegally obtained a green card, but he was caught and deported back to Canada. While working at a Vancouver nightclub, he learned how to play the guitar, wrote songs, and took vocal lessons with Patricia Dahlquist. He started writing and performing his own songs and spent two years producing a self-financed album. This album did not meet with success but, in 2002, Paris was approached by bass player Dave Devindisch, who asked if he would be interested in recording a demo. Paris and Devindisch formed a two-man band and spent a year playing at local venues. In 2003, they met the Jamaican singer-songwriter DaGriff, who joined the band; he was followed by guitarist Greg Ellis and former Doug and the Slugs members, drummer Chris Murray Driver and keyboardist Marc Gladstone. In 2005, Paris approached Vancouver record producers Troy Samson of Hipjoint Productions (Moka Only, Kreesha Turner, Snoop Dogg), and Jeff Dawson (State of Shock, Kelly Rowland, Daniel Powter, Marcy Playground), to rework six of the original recordings. The newly-named Brandon Paris Band was ready to shop its debut album \\"On My Own\\". In January 2006, Brandon Paris Band signed a deal with Koch Entertainment just days after sending out the album to record labels across Canada, with many offers following. The album's first single, \\"Rewind and Start Again\\", was released on March 13, 2006 and was a huge success on commercial radio, climbing to the top 20 on the Canadian CHR charts (tracked by Radio & Records (Billboard Information Group)). The album's second single, \\"Somebody to Hold\\", peaked at No. 53 on CHR (tracked by Radio & Records(Billboard Information Group)). A month later, in an attempt to get better results, Koch Entertainment released a third single, \\"Give Me a Reason\\", but it was not enough to push the album further. However, in 2007, the band was nominated for Best New Group or Solo Artist (CHR) by the Canadian Radio Music Awards.

In 2007, Ellis and Devindisch were replaced by Bryan Jasper on guitar and Brian Sanheim on bass, and Paris starting writing songs for the band's second album, \\"Pocket Full of Holes\\".

A prominent businessman, he helped lay out the towns of Bellevue and Decatur, Nebraska. Nebraska's legislature named Sarpy County after him in honor of his service to the state.  Biography  Peter A. Sarpy was likely born in St. Louis, Missouri on November 3, 1805. He was christened Pierre Sylvester Gr√©goire Sarpy, but he later anglicized his name. He also took his mother's maiden name, L'Abadie, using \\"A\\" for his middle initial. Peter's father was Gr√©goire Sarpy, who died in 1824. Peter had two brothers. The family was French Creole from Louisiana. They joined other ethnic French in migrating to the growing town of St. Louis after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 by the United States. The lucrative fur trade and much of the economy of St. Louis was originally dominated by ethnic French families. They established trading posts along the upper Missouri River and also to the Southwest in Spanish territory.  Nebraska Territory  In 1824 at the age of 19, Sarpy went to the upper Missouri River, in the Nebraska Territory, to work at the American Fur Company's trading post at Council Bluff, north of present-day Bellevue, Nebraska. He was based at Fort Bellevue until 1831. That company was owned by renowned American fur baron John Jacob Astor, who established a monopoly in the industry. Sarpy next worked for his brother's father-in-law, John Pierre Cabann√©, who ran Cabanne's Trading Post.Federal Writers Project. (1939) Nebraska: A Guide to the Cornhusker State, Nebraska State Historical Society, p. 267 Cabann√©'s Post and Pilcher's Post, the latter established at Bellevue by the Missouri Fur Company, competed for the fur trade of area Indian tribes: the Siouan-speaking Omaha, Ponca, Otoe, and Pawnee. The Missouri Fur Company was founded by French Creole families of St. Louis. Some of their ancestors had migrated to the new settlement of St. Louis in the late eighteenth century from farms in western Illinois. They left when the latter area was transferred from French to British control following Great Britain's victory over France in the Seven Years' War. More migrated after the American Revolution, as they wanted to evade US Protestant rule in Illinois. The fur trade in the region yielded such profits that for decades it was the most important driver of the St. Louis economy. In 1821 it represented $600,000 of the town's annual commerce of $2 million.James Neal Primm, Lion of the Valley: St. Louis, Missouri, 1764-1980, St. Louis: St. Louis Historical Society Press, 3rd edition, 1998, p. 124 Sarpy later established a trading post and supply point for white settlers and pioneers on the Iowa side of the upper Missouri River. It went by various names, including Sarpy's Point and the \\"Trader's Post\\".\\"History of Sarpy County\\", Nebraska Association of County Officials. Retrieved 8/8/08.\\"The Early Ferries\\" . Retrieved 8/8/08. In 1832 Cabann√© ordered Sarpy to head a group of American Fur Company employees to take over a keelboat and goods which belonged to a competing company. Because of its profits, the fur trade business had cutthroat competition. After they were caught, US authorities ordered Cabann√© and Sarpy to leave the Indian Territory for a year. The company replaced Cabann√© with Joshua Pilcher at Cabann√©'s Trading Post in North Omaha.\\"Nebraska National Register Sites in Sarpy County\\", Nebraska State Historical Society, Retrieved 8/8/08. Sarpy operated the Council Bluff trading post during 1835.  Colorado  Sarpy moved westward the next year, and in 1837 he established Fort Jackson on the upper South Platte River in present- day Colorado. Financed by Pratt, Chouteau, and Company, Sarpy established the fort with the help of Henry Fraeb, an experienced trapper and former Rocky Mountain Fur Company man. At Fort Jackson, the two traded tin ware, traps, clothes, blankets, powder, lead, and whiskey for pelts. Sarpy did well at this trading post, maintaining an inventory of $12,000 and paying his employees $200 a year. Bent, St. Vrain & Company bought out Fort Jackson to avoid competing with the Sarpy operation. After the sale, Sarpy cut ties with Fraeb. Fraeb was killed in 1850 by Sioux Indians (Lakota) along the Snake River.  Missouri  thumbIn this cause We agree that a Judgment of Guilty be entered in this entitled cause against Deft Peter Sarpy, and the Plaintiff Andrew, Feb. 2. 1841. At some point, Sarpy returned to St. Louis, where he owned at least one slave, known as Andrew. Andrew's mother, Celeste, helped her son to sue Sarpy for his freedom in 1839. In this process, she filed as his \\"next friend\\", as authorized under the state's slave law. Andrew alleged trespass and false imprisonment. Apparently members of Andrew's family had earlier been pronounced free by a verdict of the circuit court of St. Louis and St Charles county. Andrew said that Sarpy had beat and mistreated him and, most importantly, held him as a slave although he was a free person. The suit asked for damages of $200 and Andrew's freedom. Sarpy pleaded not guilty to these charges, but he was convicted in court on February 2, 1841.  Returning to Nebraska  In 1838, Sarpy returned to the Bellevue area and built another trading post. He lived primarily at Fort Bellevue for the next twenty-six years. After Sarpy returned, he became influential in community affairs. About 1846 he started a ferry business across the Missouri, between Bellevue and the Iowa side. Through the next year, he ferried migrating Mormons across the river and also sold them supplies for the rest of their westward trip. During the ensuing gold rush years, Sarpy's ferry boats hauled many would-be gold miners across the Missouri River.\\"Peter Sarpy\\" , NebraskaStudies.org. Retrieved 8/8/08. Sarpy expanded his ferry business in two other locations: to cross the Elkhorn River at Elkhorn City, later called Elk City, and also at a fork of the Loup River near present-day Columbus. By the 1850s, his fleet included a steam-powered ferry.\\"Peter A. Sarpy\\" , Retrieved 8/8/08 Through his efforts, in 1849 a United States post office, mark of a rising town, was established in Bellevue. Following the United States' negotiation in 1854 of a treaty by which the Omaha people ceded their land in Nebraska, that year Sarpy was among the group that laid out the town of Bellevue. In 1857 Sarpy joined Stephen Decatur and others in founding Decatur along the Missouri in northeastern Burt County.\\"Peter Abadie Sarpy\\", Nebraska Social Studies Association, Retrieved 8/8/08.\\"Bellevue - Sarpy County\\", University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Retrieved 8/8/08. Sarpy and his family moved to Plattsmouth in 1862. He died there on January 4, 1865. He is buried in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri. Marriage and family Sarpy married Ni-co-mi (also spelled Ni-co-ma), an Iowa woman. She brought her mixed-race daughter Mary Gale to the marriage. Ni-co-mi had been the consort of the American surgeon John Gale, who had been stationed at Fort Atkinson in Nebraska. When it was closed in 1827 and Gale was reassigned, he left Ni-co-mi and Mary behind.Erin Pedigo, The Gifted Pen: the Journalism Career of Susette \\"Bright Eyes\\" La Flesche Tibbles, Master's Thesis, University of Nebraska Lincoln, April 2011, accessed 23 August 2011 Sarpy and Ni-co-mi also had children together. As an adult, Mary Gale (also known as Hinnuaganun, or One Woman) married Joseph LaFlesche, a M√©tis fur trader of Ponca and French descent. Adopted as a son by the Omaha chief Big Elk and designated his successor, LaFlesche became the last recognized principal chief of the Omaha and the only one to have had any European ancestry. He led the people in their transition to living on a reservation.\\"Joseph La Flesche: Sketch of the Life of the Head Chief of the Omaha\\", first published in the (Bancroft, Nebraska) Journal; reprinted in The Friend, 1889, accessed 23 August 2011 Honors and legacy * Sarpy County was named in his honor.\\"Peter Abadie Sarpy\\", Nebraska Social Studies Association.

In the words of Eddie Chambers: \\"In her work as an artist, academic, art historian, writer and curator, Archer-Straw consistently challenged the prevailing orthodoxies that treat Caribbean artists and cultural practice in geographical, racial and artistic isolation.

Dieter Noll (31 December 1927 ‚Äì 6 February 2008) was a German writer. His best known work is the two volume novel Die Abenteuer des Werner Holt from the early 1960s which had sold over two million copies by his death. Life Dieter Noll was born in Riesa, Saxony to a pharmacist. His mother, who was half Jewish, suffered from repression after the Nuremberg Laws were enacted in Nazi Germany. Noll attended an Oberschule before being drafted as a Luftwaffenhelfer, or assistant in the Nazi air force. Noll served as Luftwaffe support personnel in the Schweren Heimatflakbatterie 210 in Borna district of Chemnitz, though at the end of 1944 he became a soldier in the Wehrmacht. Towards the end of the war, he was captured as prisoner of war by the Americans. After his release, he took his Abitur, or school-leaving certificate, in Chemnitz. He began a study of art history, philosophy and German at the University of Jena in 1948. After 1950 he lived in Berlin as a contributing editor of the Bodo Uhse published newspaper Aufbau and an employee of the socialist Neues Deutschland. From 1956 onwards, he worked as an author. Noll lived in K√∂nigs Wusterhausen, where he also retired. Noll belonged to the Communist Party of Germany after 1946. From 1964 to 1967, he was a member of the SED Bezirk (district) of the party's Berlin leadership. Because of his faithfulness to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Noll resisted the protest with which numerous East German authors had reacted to the naturalization of Wolf Biermann after 1976. In May 1979 Noll described in an open letter to Erich Honecker the authors Stefan Heym, Joachim Seyppel and Rolf Schneider as \\"kaputte Typen\\" (broken types) who, allegedly, were turning their craving for admiration into no lesser an evil than an actual class enemy might have been. These questionable letters helped bring about exclusion of new authors from the Schriftstellerverband of East Germany in June 1979. He worked as an informer for the Stasi. Noll reported in the early 1950s about the building phase of East Germany. His main work is the two-volume autobiographically shaped novel Die Abenteuer des Werner Holt. In the first volume, Holt's development, through Nazism, shaped candidates for the Luftwaffenhelfer and Wehrmacht to the military prison. The reader can follow Holt's beginning doubts by the end of the Third Reich. The second volume portrays the difficult development of a Wehrmacht soldier during the beginnings of Socialism. The work has sold two million copies. The first volume was filmed and integrated into the East German school curriculum. Dieter Noll was a member of the Schriftstellerverband (Writer's League) of East Germany beginning in 1954, and from 1963 to 1966 was acting chairman of the organization's Berlin chapter. He belonged to the Akademie der K√ºnste in East Berlin after 1969. He received the following awards: the 1955 Literature Prize of the Free German Trade Union Federation (FDGB), the 1961 Heinrich Mann Prize, the 1963 and 1979 National Prize of East Germany, Second Class, the 1964 Johannes R. Becher Medal in Gold as well as the 1979 Art Prize of the FDGB. His son Hans, born in 1954, goes by Chaim Noll and lives as an Israeli writer.

Since he already belonged to the SED's Bezirk of Potsdam leadership since 1964, he was a member of the SED's Central Committee from 1967. Between 1953 and 1972, he was an unofficial informer of the East German Stasi. Bernhard Seeger wrote reportages, narratives, novels and poems though best known for his radio and televised dramas. Seeger's party politic works dealt with the prominent problems of the building phase of the East German society, that of the East German critic highly praised work\\"Herbstrauch\\" about the collective farming of the East German agriculture in 1959/60 had strong influence of Sholokhov's \\"New Land under the Plough\\". Bernhard Seeger belonged to the Schriftstellerverband of East Germany since 1952 and the Academy of Arts, Berlin between 1969 and 1991. He won the following awards: the 1956 Theodor Fontane Prize of the Bezirk Potsdam, the 1960 Erich Weinert Medal, the 1962 Heinrich Mann Prize and Literature Prize of the Free German Trade Union Federation (FDGB), the 1963 and 1967 National Prize of East Germany, the 1968 Johannes R.

During World War I, she was known as USS El Oriente (ID-4504) in service with the United States Navy. At the end of war, she reverted to her original name of SS El Oriente. During World War II she was chartered by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) as SS Henri Dunant (sometimes also spelled Henry Dunant), but reverted to her original name of SS El Oriente at the end of the charter. SS El Oriente was one of four sister ships that carried cargo and a limited number of passengers for the Morgan Line. She was acquired by the U.S. Navy in July 1918, and converted to carry horses and mules to France, and after the Armistice, was converted again to carry American troops home from Europe. El Oriente returned to the Morgan Line in 1919 and sailed with them until June 1941, when the entire Morgan Line fleet was purchased by the United States Maritime Commission. El Oriente served as a civilian-crewed cargo ship during World War II, sailing primarily between the United States and the United Kingdom. In September 1944, she was chartered by the ICRC and sailed under the Swiss flag carrying food parcels to American prisoners of war held in German camps. Henri Dunant continued to sail under Swiss charter until October 1945, when she was returned to the United States and reverted to her former name. El Oriente was placed in the James River Reserve Fleet in November 1945, and was sold for scrapping in July 1946.  Early career  SS El Oriente was a cargo and passenger steamship launched on 11 May 1910 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. of Newport News, Virginia (yard no. 132), and delivered to the Atlantic division of the Morgan Line on 24 October 1910. She was the third of four sister ships; the other three being , El Mundo, and . El Oriente was , was long by abeam, and made . The vessel sailed for the Morgan Line, the brand name of the Southern Pacific Steamship Company (a subsidiary of the Southern Pacific Railroad), which employed her to carry cargo and a limited number of passengers between New York; New Orleans, the eastern terminus of the Southern Pacific line; and Galveston, Texas.  World War I  After the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, it's unclear what role, if any, El Oriente played early on in the war. Her sister ships and were both requisitioned by the United States Shipping Board (USSB) on behalf of the United States Army,See: Also: and both were designated as animal transport ships.Krenzelok If El Oriente were used by the Army as an animal transport ship, she would have needed a refit which typically meant that any second- or third-class passenger accommodations had to be ripped out and replaced with ramps and stalls for the horses and mules carried.Crowell and Wilson, pp. 313‚Äì14. It is known that El Oriente sailed in an American convoy to France on 16 April 1918 with U.S. Navy transports , , , and , British transports Czar and Czaritza, and U.S. cruiser , and reached France on 28 April.Crowell and Wilson, p. 607.The convoy was joined by , which had sailed from Hoboken, New Jersey, on 19 April. See: Crowell and Wilson, p. 607. The next recorded activity of El Oriente was on 29 July, when she was acquired by the U.S. Navy and commissioned the same day with Lieutenant Commander William Delahanty, USNRF, in command. El Oriente was assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) and carried animals and supplies for the U.S. Army, joining her two sister ships, and in that duty. El Oriente's first Navy voyage to France began when she sailed from Newport News with 500 animals on 11 August. Unlike earlier animal transport crossings for the Army, where there was as much as a 4% mortality rate, the voyages in August 1918 and after carried a transport veterinarian and a permanent veterinary detachment to care for the animals while on board the ship. As part of this new program, El Oriente delivered her full load of horses and mules‚Äî suffering no losses‚Äîat Bordeaux on 2 September. El Oriente made an additional roundtrip with 500 more animals in October, losing only three of her equine cargo during the voyage. El Oriente continued sailing for the NOTS through April 1919, sometimes carrying a small number of troops on return voyages to the United States. At that time El Oriente was converted to carry troops, and assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force to help return larger numbers American servicemen from Europe. She sailed on 11 June for Bordeaux and returned with officers and men of the 6th Cavalry Regiment on 4 July. She made additional voyages in July and August, returning 978 members of the 3rd Infantry Division to Philadelphia on the latter voyage. In all, El Oriente returned 2,986 healthy and wounded American servicemen from France in three voyages.Gleaves, pp. 254‚Äì55 On 15 September at Philadelphia, El Orente was decommissioned, and returned to the Morgan Line soon after.Gleaves (p. 255) reports that El Oriente was given to the Ward Line in August 1919, which contradicts the entry in the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, and the information in the Miramar Ship Index, a database of historical ship information (See: .)  Interwar civilian service  El Oriente resumed cargo service with the Morgan Line, and enjoyed a quiet career, typically sailing between New York and Galveston.See, for example: One event of note occurred in February 1922 when El Oriente came upon the wreck of the schooner, Caldwell H. Colt, which had run aground on a reef near the Tortugas Light during a gale. When El Oriente came upon the hulk, only her captain remained alive, surviving without food or water for several days before his rescue. El Oriente continued on to Galveston and landed the man there.  World War II  In June 1941, the United States Maritime Commission (USMC) announced that it had requisitioned the entire Morgan Line fleet of ten ships, including El Oriente and her remaining sister ships, El Occidente and El Mundo.The fourth sister, , had been involved in a collision in 1927 and had been scrapped afterwards. See: Colton, Newport News Shipbuilding . The ships were to finish previously scheduled cargo runs and be handed over to the USMC over the following six weeks. The USMC had been charged with assembling a U.S. fleet to \\"aid the democracies\\" fighting Germany in World War II, and paid $4.7 million for the ships and a further $2.6 million for repairs and refits. El Oriente was handed over to the USMC and assigned to United States Lines, Inc., for operation. The cargo ship was placed under Panamanian registry by U.S. Lines. Little is known of El Oriente's movements over the next eight months, but on 17 February El Oriente sailed from Houston, Texas, to Philadelphia and on to Reykjav√≠k. From Reykjav√≠k, she sailed to the Clyde, arriving there at the end of July. Over the next 5 months, El Oriente sailed around the British Isles, calling at Kirkwall, Belfast Lough, Barrow-in-Furness, and Liverpool, and back to Clyde in late December. From there, she sailed on one trip to Murmansk where she arrived on 27 January 1943. Murmansk had limited port facilities and slow unloading of cargo (often performed by Soviet women and political prisoners), which, coupled with inclement weather and long waits for convoy escorts, often required lengthy stays by Allied cargo ships. El Oriente was no exception, staying in Murmansk for nearly five weeks. To compound the lengthy wait (and, often, accompanying boredom) faced by cargo ships waiting to unload, the nearest German airfield was away‚Äîabout 7 to 10 minutes flying time‚Äîwhich gave almost no advance warning of air raids. German dive bombers would silently glide in below Soviet anti-aircraft fire, drop their payloads, and fly away. El Oriente was caught in one such attack on 27 February, with four of the ship's Naval Armed Guards men killed in the attack.Morison, pp. 370‚Äì72. El Oriente departed Kola Inlet on 1 March and returned to Liverpool, from which she sailed in a convoy for New York on 6 April,El Oriente's sister ship El Mundo sailed in the same convoy, Convoy ON 177. See: The two sailed together in three more convoys‚ÄîHX 251, HX 286/WN 573, and EN 381/ON 236‚Äîthroughout the rest of the war. See: and returned to Belfast Lough in late June. After calling at Barry and Milford Haven, El Oriente began two roundtrips to New York at the end of June. In October the ship visited Loch Ewe, Methil, and Immingham before returning to New York again in November. After another transatlantic crossing and circuit amongst British ports, El Oriente returned to New York in May 1944. In June, the cargo vessel sailed to Cuba, calling at Havana and Puerto Tarafa before returning to New York. She next sailed to La Guaira, Venezuela; Maracaibo, Venezuela; and J√∫caro, Cuba, before returning to New York in mid August. El Oriente sailed to Philadelphia in mid September in preparation for a charter.  Red Cross ship  On 28 September 1944, El Oriente was chartered by the International Committee of the Red Cross, reflagged as a Swiss ship, and renamed SS Henry Dunant (sometimes erroneously spelled as Henri Dunant), after Red Cross movement founder Henry Dunant. She was last of 14 ships chartered by Swiss interests to sail under the Swiss flag during World War II. On 5 October, Henry Dunant departed Philadelphia with a cargo of mail and 900,000 food parcels intended for Allied prisoners of war interned in German camps. Henry Dunant continued sailing for the ICRC through 24 October 1945. The ship returned to Norfolk, resumed her former name of El Oriente, and entered the James River Reserve Fleet on 7 November 1945. On 3 July 1946, El Oriente was sold for scrapping to the Patapsco Scrap Co., of Baltimore, Maryland, for $12,175.

A 2016 inductee into the Cable Television Industry's Hall of Fame, Evans is perhaps best known for his role in co-founding the public affairs cable network C-SPAN, which put cameras in the halls and legislature of the US Congress to document the legislative work of America's elected officials for the first time. The network came about through a conversation he had with a former navy buddy of his Brian Lamb, who shared his idea of an all-Congress television station with Evans in July 1977. Evans then helped Lamb found and develop the network. Evans' chief occupation at the time was President of Arlington TeleCommunications Corp, as he helped to expand the idea for a more locally oriented network to one that had major access to the halls of Congress. In the 1980s, Evans also became President of Hauser Communications when it acquired Arlington TeleCommunications Corp and changed its name to Arlington Cable Partners, and continued to served on the board of C-SPAN. After being named Chairman of C-SPAN's Executive Committee (1992-1994), he helped draft a new plan named \\"C-SPAN 2000\\" to provide new strategic direction, implemented as Evans was Chairman of the board for C-SPAN itself in the early 1990s. During his tenure as Chairman, C-SPAN was the winner of several Golden Cable ACE awards, a Peabody Award, and a Golden Beacon Award. By the mid-1980s Evans was serving as chairman and CEO of Evans Telecommunications. He also served on the boards of the National Cable Television Association, the Washington Metropolitan Cable Club, and Falcon Cable Holdings. Since helping to found C-SPAN, Evans has appeared on the network more than 100 times. Today he continues to serve as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Evans Telecommunications Co, The John D. Evans Foundation, as Founding Director of the National Cable Satellite Corporation and Director of National Cable & Telecommunications Association. He is also on the board of Internet2, a consortium of 221 US Universities operating an 8.8 Terabit capacity research and education network. From 2013-2017, Evans was Industry representative to the board of Trustees of the Digital Preservation Network. In 2009 Evans was named Entrepreneur of the Year by Washington & Jefferson College. In 2005 Evans was invited by Emory University to consult with Emory committees and serve on a Futurist Forum Panel to help Emory develop its strategic plan. Other Business Activities In 1992, Evans bought Waterford Farm in Middleburg, Virginia and began breeding cattle. He is also an investor and serves on the board of Accelerator Technology Holdings headquartered in Amman, Jordan. John also served as co-chair of Dr. Robert Gallo‚Äôs Advisory Board at the Institute of Human Virology. Honors and awards In 2009 Evans received the Courage in Business award from the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce. In 2018 University of Maryland School of Medicine awarded him a lifetime-achievement award for public service. In 2019, He was honored with 2019 Distinguished Alumnus Award from University Liggett School. Personal life Evans is the son of Edward S. Evans, Jr, former CEO of Evans Products Company, nephew of Robert Beverley Evans, and grandson of Edward S. Evans Sr, who, in 1926, flew around the world in 28 days setting the world's record with pilot Linton Wells. John Evans is a graduate of the University of Michigan, and has homes in Sag Harbor, New York and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.

The dance is characterized by sensual hip and body movements. Partners hold each other in a closed position where the female's inside right thigh is in contact with the inside of the male's right thigh, while using the hand placements of typical Latin style dances. Origin With the popularization of bachata music, dancers worldwide tapped into the romantic side of bachata finding new ways of expressing their passion. In 2002, as bachata began to be played on radio worldwide, dancers learned the basic four-steps to the dance and began to elaborate as they felt would express their passion. Although, the dance style utilizes bachata music it is rarely danced socially amongst bachata dancers or in the Dominican Republic, nor is it danced amongst Argentine tango dancers. With the quick progression of this style, it is now being danced to both bachata and tango and it is seen in bachata competitions worldwide. Many Latin dance studios and festivals offer bachatango workshops. These classes are often seen in festivals that also teach salsa, bachata an kizomba. In the southeast US, the Atlanta Bachata Festival and the Unity of Dance Festival in Orlando, Florida, offer bachatango workshops.

The species is distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian and west Pacific Oceans from South Africa to New Zealand and Japan, inhabiting coastal waters, especially reefs, to a depth of 90 m. The longnose trevally is distinguished from similar species by a combination of a scaleless breast and the number of gill rakers and fin rays. It is a moderately large fish, growing to a maximum known length of 72 cm and 4.35 kg. The longnose trevally is a predatory fish, consuming small fish, crustaceans and molluscs. The species is of minor commercial importance throughout its range, and is considered to be a good table fish. Taxonomy and naming The longnose trevally is classified within the genus Carangoides, a group of fish commonly called jacks and trevallies. Carangoides falls into the jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, the Carangidae are part of the order Carangiformes. The species was first scientifically described by the French taxonomist Georges Cuvier in 1833, based on the holotype specimen collected from the waters of the Seychelles. He named the new species Caranx chrysophrys, with the specific name meaning 'golden eyebrow' in Greek. The generic position of the species was revised twice, being placed in Citula by William Ogilby and finally into Carangoides by Ian Munro, where it has remained. The species has been independently described on a number of occasions, the first when Pieter Bleeker identified a fish he believed was similar, but not the same as Carangoides chrysophrys, and named it Carangoides chrysophryoides. Other synonyms include Caranx nigrescens, Caranx jayakari and Caranx typus. These are all considered to be junior synonyms under the ICZN rules and are no longer used. The species has a number of common names, with the most often used names, 'longnose trevally' (or 'longnose kingfish') and 'club-nosed trevally' in reference to the snout profile of the fish. The names 'dusky trevally' and 'grunting trevally' are used for the fish in the United States. Description left240pxThe longnose trevally is similar to other jacks in its overall body profile, having a strongly compressed, ovate shape as a juvenile, gradually becoming more oblong with age. It is a moderately large fish, recorded up to 72 cm in length and 4.35 kg in weight. The dorsal profile is more convex than the ventral profile. One of the species major diagnostic characters is its snout shape, having a gently sloped dorsal profile from the nape to near the snout, but becoming abruptly vertical just before the mouth cleft. Both of the jaws contain anteriorly widening bands of small villiform teeth, with larger individuals also having a number of conical outer teeth. There are two separate dorsal fins, the first consisting of 8 spines and the second of 1 spine and 18 to 20 soft rays. The anal fin comprises two detached anterior spines, followed by 1 spine and 14 to 17 soft rays. The lobes of both the soft anal and dorsal fin are falcate, with juveniles having the anteriormost rays extended into filaments. These are lost in adults, with the lobes becoming shorter than the head. The pectoral fins are long and falcate, not quite reaching the intersection of the arched and straight sections of the lateral line. The lateral line is moderately curved anteriorly, with this section up to twice as long as the straight section, which has between 20 and 37 weak scutes present. The breast of the longnose trevally is scaleless, extending up to behind the pelvic fin origin and laterally to the pectoral fin base. Five to 9 gill rakers occur on the first arch and 15 to 18 on the second arch, and the species has 24 vertebrae. The longnose trevally is generally silver in colour, with the body and head greenish-blue above, becoming silvery with yellow-green reflections below. The operculum has a small black blotch on the upper margin. The dorsal and anal fins range in colour from whitish to pale yellow to dusky, with the membranes of soft anal fin rays often having a white spot at the base. The caudal and pectoral fins are pale to dusky yellow. Large adults often exhibit very dark head and fin colouration, nearing black. These fish are perhaps exhibiting mating or spawning colouration. Distribution and habitat The longnose trevally inhabits tropical to subtropical waters in the Indian and west Pacific Oceans, ranging from South Africa and Madagascar, north to the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, east to India, South East Asia, Indonesia, Japan and to Fiji. The longnose trevally has been reported from many west Pacific islands, indicating that it is widespread in this region. The species ranges as far north as the Okinawa, Japan and as far south as northern Australia and New Zealand. The longnose trevally is an inshore fish, normally found on coastal reefs and occasionally in large protected bays. It appears to be more tolerant of dirty, turbid waters than most of it relatives, but is not seen in estuaries. Juveniles reportedly inhabit shallow bays close to the coast, and are occasionally seen near beaches. Adults live in much deeper water, normally between 30 and 60 m, although have been recorded at depths of around 90 m. Biology and fishery The longnose trevally is an epibenthic predator, taking prey from the seafloor or just above it, with only one study ever to thoroughly record its diet, which was carried out in the Gulf of Carpentaria of Australia. Here it was found its main prey were small fish, with considerable quantities of molluscs, brachyurans, and other crustaceans also taken. In South Africa, the species is thought to prefer prawns as its major dietary component, with crabs and small fish also taken. The longnose trevally has a fairly soft mouth, which may partly determine its diet. Very little is known of reproduction in the species, although juveniles have been recorded from shallow coastal bays. The longnose trevally is of minor importance to fisheries throughout its range, taken by hook and line, bottom trawls, gill nets and various types of trap. It is usually sold fresh, and is often not distinguished from other species of carangid. The species is occasionally caught by boat anglers, as well as beach fishermen on the South African coast. They take small baits and are considered good for eating.

Criticism  Their programs are widely used in the Korean internet environment; and depend on ActiveX and Microsoft Windows. Internet banks in the Korea need these programs by law, so users using Linux, Mac OS X, or other browsers or operating systems besides Internet Explorer and Microsoft Windows can not access these online banks.Simply go to Internet banking page of the Post office of Korea, http://www.epostbank.go.kr/?dp_id=D_001 and try to run the banking menu. Using MSIE, you can see many Security Alerts. Using other browsers, you will be unable to proceed. That page means 'If you see alert message, must allow all(Message for only MSIE). Most of the functions run at kernel level of an OS, so versions of Windows that use UAC or User Account Control (Windows Vista, Windows 7 and higher.) are unable to run smoothly. Moreover, this program can crash kernel of x64 windows system and some input devices especially USB Keyboard, in conjunction with nProtect caused by same reason. nProtect Netizen, nProtect Personal and nProtect Keycrypt are programs used mostly for internet banking in Korea. They are programmed to terminate processes that are not associated with banking, but processes are terminated indiscriminately if they are deemed a threat and thus may compromise a system's stability. These programs also inject themselves into all existing processes from startup, and sometimes collide with other anti-viruses. More problematically, Korean banks do not update their program every time INCA releases an update.

The first stage of the battle was fought when the US 3rd Infantry Division fought to surround the town. The second stage was fought when soldiers from the U.S. 101st Airborne Division fought to clear and secure the city. Background The city of Najaf sits astride important highways leading north to Karbala and Baghdad. Rather than simply bypassing the town as had been done with Nasiriyah and Samawah, the 3rd ID decided to isolate the town to prevent it from being used to stage attacks on American supply lines. The plan was to seize the major bridges in Al Kifl, a town north of Najaf, and Abu Sukhayr, a town south of Najaf. The northern bridge at Al Kifl was codenamed Objective Jenkins and the southern bridge in Abu Sukhayr was codenamed Objective Floyd. Before the attack started, heavy sand storms in the area grounded all the Army's helicopters, denying air support to the American forces. ODA 544 of Bravo Company, 2nd Battalion 5th SFG was infiltrated by onto the Wadi al Khirr Airfield by MC-130 and drove 80 km to Najaf, on arrival it began setting up vehicle checkpoints to gather local intelligence. Previously ODA 572 had driven into the city after being given the wrong grid reference, but quickly withdrew under Iraqi mortar fire.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.116-117 Apache attack on 24 March On 24 March 32 AH-64D Longbow Apache attack helicopters of the 11th Aviation Regiment were tasked with carrying out a long range penetration mission against armored forces belonging to the Iraqi Republican Guard's Medina Division which was positioned outside Najaf. Rather than provide close air support near the front lines, the helicopters were going to be used in a manner similar to strike aircraft. It is believed that Iraqi observers had the 11th AvR's forward assembly areas under observation. Regardless, when the helicopter forces of 1-227 AVN and 6-6 CAV approached Najaf that night, the city's power grid was shut down for several seconds as a signal that the helicopters were approaching. Heavy antiaircraft and small arms fire targeted the helicopters. Every single helicopter on the mission was hit and one even survived a direct hit from a rocket-propelled grenade. The flight turned back towards base, with some of the helicopters on fire and others running on one engine or shot full of holes. One Apache was brought down and crash-landed in a marsh. Combat search-and-rescue aircraft were unable to reach the crash site due to the heavy antiaircraft fire. The two crew, CWO Ronald Young Jr. and CWO David Williams, attempted to evade Iraqi forces by swimming down a canal. After swimming a quarter mile, they left the canal and tried to make a break across open ground towards a treeline. However, they were spotted in the bright moonlight by armed civilians and surrendered after being fired upon. They were handed over to Iraqi forces and would eventually be rescued in mid- April near Tikrit.http://www.sfgate.com/cgi- bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/04/14/MN252903.DTL The Iraqi government would show the helicopter on TV and claim that the helicopter had been shot down by a farmer with a bolt-action rifle, however due to the high volume of anti- aircraft fire and the armor of the Apache it is unlike that a single rifle could bring down an Apache.https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/25/1048354604384.html The downed helicopter was later destroyed by firing two MGM-140 ATACMS surface-to- surface missiles at it from long range to prevent its equipment being used by the Iraqis.https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/25/world/a-nation-at-war-military- analysis-the-goal-is-baghdad-but-at-what-cost.html?pagewanted=all The failed attack would cause much controversy, with some arguing that the mission showed the Apache was ineffective at long range strikes due to lack of stealth and high vulnerability to ground fire due to lack of adequate armor, and that it should be limited to close air support missions. Others argued that the failure of the 24 March mission was due to poor planning and breaches of operational security rather than any defect in the Apache itself. On 26 March, the AH-64A Apache attack helicopters of 2-6 CAV attempted another long range strike, however this strike was co-ordinated with a pre-mission artillery barrage as well as co-operation with F/A-18 Hornet strike aircraft. Also, Apaches never stopped to hover and instead fired on the move. These tactics led to the destruction of 7 anti-aircraft guns, 5 radars, 3 artillery pieces and 25 other vehicles versus no Apaches lost.http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2003/030325-apache01.htm Objective Jenkins The job of capturing Objective Jenkins in Al Kifl was given to the 1st Brigade Combat Team headed by Col. Will Grimsley. However, at the time of the order 1st BCT was strung out between Nasiriyah and Najaf. The only available unit to attack Objective Jenkins was the brigade's air defense battery, equipped with M6 Bradley Linebacker armored vehicles, along with a reconnaissance unit and forward air controllers. At 1:00 AM on 25 March, the air defense unit attacked towards the bridge and ran into heavy fighting against entrenched Iraqi paramilitary forces. Fighting throughout the night, the men made slow progress, calling in artillery strikes on the entrenched Iraqis. Before dawn, the air defense troops called for reinforcements and Col. Grimsley called LTC Rock Marcone to send in Bravo Company 3rd battalion 7th Infantry Regiment. Upon linking up at 8:30 AM, the air defense troops were sent to guard the flanks while B co. 3/7 Inf continued the attack towards the bridge, fighting against Iraqi foot soldiers and using infantry to clear buildings along the road. At 11:00 AM, B Co. 3/7 Inf attacked the bridge. After 3 tanks had driven on to the bridge, Iraqi sappers detonated explosives that had been wired onto the bridge. The bridge failed to collapse, but it was damaged, trapping three M1 Abrams tanks on the far side of the bridge. After inspecting the bridge and deciding it could hold a tank, LTC Rock Marcone the Battalion Commander of Task Force 3/69 AR ground guided his personal tank across the bridge. The bridge held and in an act of individual heroism, he walked across the center of the bridge in plain view of the enemy and under direct small arms and mortar fire. He linked up with the cut off tanks and then sent the rest of the American armored force across the bridge, engaging Iraqi troops on the other side in vicious close quarters fighting. The troops came under fire from Iraqi mortars and were under near-suicidal attack from Iraqi forces who would charge their positions in pickup trucks, cars, dump trucks. 3 Bradley Fighting vehicles were hit by RPGs. These attacks continued all day on 26 March, but they failed to dislodge the American forces from the bridge. Bravo Company 3/7 INF stayed at Object Jenkins until relieved by 3/7 cav on the afternoon of 27 March. Bravo Company 3/7 Infantry was engaged in ground combat with Iraqi forces from a total of 36 hours and faced up to 1200 Iraqi paramilitary forces. The capture of Objective Jenkins isolated Najaf from the north. Objective Floyd At 6:00 AM on 25 March, the 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment attacked Objective Floyd. Fighting took place in a sandstorm which reduced visibility to 25 meters, causing the Americans to rely on thermal imaging to target Iraqi troops. At 10:43 AM the bridge was reached and was found to not be wired for detonation. After crossing the bridge, the 7th Cavalry sent Troops A and B north to secure a dam and bridge and set up blocking positions to further isolate Najaf. This group came under attack by hundreds of Iraqi paramilitaries who snuck up at close quarters during the sandstorm. At the same time, Troop C securing the bridge around Objective Floyd came under heavy attack by Iraqi forces charging their positions in civilian vehicles, even going so far as to ram an M3 Bradley with a city bus and crashing a loaded fuel tanker through the American lines. Although helicopters were still grounded due to the sand storm, aircraft could fly above the sand and deliver GPS-guided munitions. Several airstrikes by B-1B Lancer bombers destroyed two Iraqi T-72 tanks. While Troop B was moving northwards it was ambushed by Iraqi forces at close range. During this engagement, two M1 Abrams tanks and one M3 Bradley AFV were knocked out and their ammunition ignited. However the blast panels worked as they were designed and no crewmen were killed. Initial reports indicated that the tanks had been hit by Russian-made 9M133 Kornet antitank missiles, however, no evidence that the Iraqis possessed Kornets was ever found, and it is now thought that the tanks were disabled by hits from a RPG-18.http://www.janes.com/defence/land_forces/news/jdw/jdw030620_1_n.shtml Troop B abandoned the tanks and reached their blocking positions as nightfall put an end to the Iraqi attacks. Surrounding Najaf After nightfall on 26 March, 1st Battalion, 64th Armored Regiment attacked south from Objective Jenkins in an attempt to link up with the 7th Cavalry Regiment at Objective Floyd and thereby complete the encirclement of Najaf. That night they successfully linked up with the 7th Cavalry. On 27 March, 7th Cavalry withdrew after 120 hours of continuous combat. Inside Najaf, the situation was becoming increasingly desperate. Civilians who had made their way to American lines reported that the Saddam Fedayeen militia were forcing members of the Al-Quds Militia to fight by threatening to kill their entire families. They also reported that the local Ba'ath Party leader had been executing civilians before being killed in an airstrike. An Iraqi Army colonel reported that of the 1,200 men under his command, only 200 were left.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1004595,00.html?promoid=googlep \\"We Are Slaughtering Them\\" - Time Magazine On 29 March, four American soldiers from the Alpha Company 2nd Battalion7th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division were killed when a suicide bomber attacked their checkpoint northwest of Najaf.http://www.defenselink.mil/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID=3703https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/30/world/nation- war-overview-march-29-2003-car-bomb-buried-bodies-us-air-attacks-hands.html Taking Najaf Due to continued attacks on supply lines by Iraqi forces operating out of bypassed cities, American forces slowed their advance for several days in order to secure their supply areas for the final push on Baghdad. During this time, the 82nd Airborne Division was attacking Samawah. On 28 March, the 101st Airborne Division, supported by 2nd Battalion, 70th Armored from the 1st Armored Division relieved the 3rd ID units around Najaf. On 29 March, the 101st attacked Iraqi forces positioned in an agricultural college in the southern part of the city. They also captured Najaf's airfield. On March 30, ODA 544 linked up with the 101st Airborne and entered the city.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.117 On 31 March, the 101st launched a reconnaissance-in-force into Najaf, in the area of the Imam Ali Mosque. The men came under attack by infantry, RPGs and howitzers being fired at point- blank range. In a four-hour fight, heavy air support was used against the Iraqi forces, however the mosque was spared damage.http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2004/onpoint/ch-5.htm On 1 April, the 101st commanders deliberately did not attack a single road leading out of Najaf towards Hillah. When Iraqi forces tried to flee along this road, they were ambushed by OH-58 Kiowa helicopter gunships and were targeted by snipers. Also on 1 April, elements of the 70th Armored Regiment launched a \\"Thunder Run\\", an armored thrust through Najaf's city center. M1 Abrams tanks were used and the attack met heavy resistance but was successful. On 2 April, the 101st launched several coordinated attacks into Najaf, seizing Saddam Fedayeen strong points and capturing much equipment. By 4 April, the entire city was in American hands.

It was built specifically for the world heavyweight championship bout between Jack Dempsey of the United States and Georges Carpentier of France on July 2, 1921. It held approximately 80,000 fans and was built at a cost of $250,000. It was situated around Montgomery Street and Cornelison Avenue, on a plot of marshland owned by John F. Boyle.  Background  Tex Rickard, the promoter of the bout, initially wanted the fight to take place at the Polo Grounds in New York City. However, Nathan Lewis Miller, the governor of New York, opposed prizefighting and indicated that he did not want a Dempsey-Carpentier bout to be held in New York State. After a number of offers from other promoters, Rickard settled on a proposal from Frank Hague, the mayor of Jersey City. Hague obtained a parcel of land owned by John P. Boyle, a paper box manufacturer. The site was once the home of the Jersey City baseball team. The actual size of Boyle's land was . The octagonal structure was built using of lumber. The arena covered and during construction had the services of 500 carpenters and 400 laborers. C.S. and J.W. Edwards were the contractors. Construction started on April 28, 1921 and was completed a few days before the fight. The arena was initially due to hold 50,000 fans. However, the demand for the international extravaganza was so enormous that Rickard had to expand the arena to hold a capacity of around 80,000 to 90,000 fans. It had the greatest seating capacity of any amphitheatre ever built. In the contest between Dempsey and Carpentier, the strength and power of Dempsey was too much for the Frenchman, who was knocked out in the fourth round, with a broken thumb.  Other notable boxing cards  Boyle's Thirty Acres was used for a number of boxing cards after the Dempsey‚ÄìCarpentier bout. On Labor Day, 1921, Rickard promoted a card headlined by four champions - Johnny Wilson, Mike McTigue, Joe Gans, and Johnny Buff. On July 27, 1922, the lightweight champion Benny Leonard recorded a newspaper decision win over Lew Tendler. Luis √Ångel Firpo earned a title shot at Dempsey by knocking out ex-champion Jess Willard in the eighth round before a paid attendance of 75,712 on July 12, 1923. Firpo had less luck in 1924 when he was defeated by Harry Wills before 70,000 fans. Other notable fighters to have fought in Boyle's Thirty Acres were Tiger Flowers, Paul Berlenbach, and James J Braddock  Demise  By 1927, most major title bouts in the New York area were being held either at Yankee Stadium or the Polo Grounds. Rickard announced that the wooden arena would be demolished and in June 1927 the wrecking ball brought the short history of Boyle's Thirty Acres to an end.  Site By 1952, the site of Boyle's Thirty Acres had become a Jersey City housing project named Montgomery Gardens. After over 50 years of use, the project began to be emptied and the Jersey City Housing Authority planned to demolish the buildings in order to build mixed- use housing. Three of the six buildings were imploded in August 2015, and one was rehabilitated and converted to senior housing.

He states that he is inspired by the \\"Yeah criterion\\" ‚Äì intuitive explanations that seem to fit. He also discusses the influence of mathematics on economics and his career. He says that he is not an \\"ultramathematician\\", and is comfortable taking an intuitive approach to economic ideas. Thus he did not favor what he called \\"the MIT approach\\" of formalism. He believes that the MIT approach limits one's intuition and recollects encountering colleagues who refused to discuss economic ideas without formal models. Despite Colander's aversion to simplified formal models, he began his career working on a mathematical project. He got his break, however, when he collaborated with Abba P. Lerner on a book. After that, he was able to publish in certain journals. He began to write textbooks, and since then his recognition has grown to the point where he turns down invitations to speak, and tries to focus his publications in areas where his ideas are less well-known.

Marie Railroad (MStP&SSM;) was a Class I railroad subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the Midwestern United States. Commonly known since its opening in 1884 as the Soo Line after the phonetic spelling of Sault, it was merged with several other major CP subsidiaries on January 1, 1961 to form the Soo Line Railroad. In 1970, it reported 8249 million net ton-miles of revenue freight (and no passengers) on 4693 route-miles and 6104 track-miles operated at the end of the year.  Passenger service  A well-used Soo Line ore car, built in 1916. Hauling iron ore was an important part of the Soo Line's business. The Soo Line was never a major carrier of passenger traffic since its route between Chicago and Minneapolis was much longer than the competing Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road), Chicago and North Western Railway, and Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad routes. It also had no direct access to Milwaukee. The primary trains operated by the Soo Line were: * The Laker which operated an overnight service from Chicago's Grand Central Station to Duluth‚ÄìSuperior with a portion to Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul. An additional portion served Ashland, Wisconsin until January 1959. The Laker was discontinued completely on January 15, 1965. * The Winnipeger which operated overnight between Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul and Winnipeg. It was discontinued in March 1967. * A Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul to Western Canada service. During the 1920s and 1930s, the Soo Line operated the Soo-Pacific, a summer-only Chicago to Vancouver service with the Canadian Pacific Railway. This later became The Mountaineer, which was then reduced to Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul to Vancouver, before being discontinued in early August 1960. The Mountaineer was a summer- season-only train that carried exclusively sleeping cars but no coaches. During the non-summer months, the train ran as the Soo-Dominion from Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul to Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, where it was combined into Canadian Pacific's The Dominion transcontinental passenger train. It was cut back to a St. Paul to Portal, North Dakota run after CP discontinued passenger service to Portal at the end of 1960, before being discontinued entirely in December 1963. * A Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan overnight train, which was discontinued in March 1959. Additionally, local trains served Chicago to Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul, Duluth‚ÄìSuperior to Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul, Duluth to Thief River Falls, Minnesota, and some summer- only services which relieved The Mountaineer of the local work along its route.

The two coincide on compacta dominated homotopically by finite polyhedra. Shape theory associates with the ƒåech homology theory while homotopy theory associates with the singular homology theory. Background Shape theory was reinvented, further developed and promoted by the Polish mathematician Karol Borsuk in 1968. Actually, the name shape theory was coined by Borsuk. Warsaw Circle The Warsaw circle Borsuk lived and worked in Warsaw, hence the name of one of the fundamental examples of the area, the Warsaw circle. It is a compact subset of the plane produced by \\"closing up\\" a topologist's sine curve with an arc. The homotopy groups of the Warsaw circle are all trivial, just like those of a point, and so any map between them induces a weak homotopy equivalence. However the two spaces are not homotopy equivalent. So by the Whitehead theorem, the Warsaw circle does not have the homotopy type of a CW complex. Development Borsuk's shape theory was generalized onto arbitrary (non-metric) compact spaces, and even onto general categories, by W≈Çodzimierz Holszty≈Ñski in year 1968/1969, and published in Fund. Math. 70 , 157-168, y.1971 (see Jean-Marc Cordier, Tim Porter, (1989) below). This was done in a continuous style, characteristic for the ƒåech homology rendered by Samuel Eilenberg and Norman Steenrod in their monograph Foundations of Algebraic Topology. Due to the circumstance, Holszty≈Ñski's paper was hardly noticed, and instead a great popularity in the field was gained by a later paper by Sibe Marde≈°iƒá and Jack Segal, Fund. Math. 72, 61-68, y.1971. Further developments are reflected by the references below, and by their contents. For some purposes, like dynamical systems, more sophisticated invariants were developed under the name strong shape. Generalizations to noncommutative geometry, e.g. the shape theory for operator algebras have been found.

It is one of many Gonu games. The game has a relatively small board (4√ó4 square board), and yet offers a challenge at different levels. The game could be played on a larger board, however, it tends to be tiresome. Jul means \\"lines\\", and the lines of the board are often drawn on the ground. The game is also referred to as \\"Ne-Jul-Gonu\\" (ÎÑ§ Ï§Ñ Í≥†ÎàÑ), i.e. \\"Four Lines Gonu\\", referring to the four lines in each direction. The game bears resemblance to Hasami shogi, Dai hasami shogi, Mak-yek, Apit-sodok, Rek (Game), Ming Mang, Gundru, Seega, Ludus latrunculorum, and Petteia., and Firdawsi's Nard. It also bears resemblance to the Tafl games, and to a lesser extent to Agon, Awithlaknakwe, Bizingo, Watermelon Chess, Reversi, Othello, Wei-chi, Baduk, and Go as all of these games exhibit custodian capture or some form of it (as in the case of Wei-chi, Baduk, and Go).  Setup  A 4√ó4 square board (or grid) is used. Each player has four pieces. One plays as the black pieces, and the other plays as the white pieces. If one has a piecepack, the board is made from four face-down tiles, and players use coins, suit side up, as playing pieces. Players decide what colors to play, and who starts first. Each player's four pieces are initially set up on the first rank of their respective side of the board and which is opposite of one another.  Rules  * Players alternate their turns. Each player moves only one piece per turn. * A piece moves orthogonally (following the lines) one space onto a vacant space per turn. However, a move that repeats the previous position is not allowed. * Capture of an enemy piece or a line of (two) enemy pieces is done by the custodian method, and this must be created by the player performing the capture on his or her turn. The player's piece moves adjacently next to an enemy piece or line of (two) enemy pieces that are already flanked on the other side by a friendly piece. All these pieces must be in the same row or column with no vacant space between any of them. * A piece that moves in between two enemy pieces on a row or column (with no vacant space between any of them) is not captured by the enemy player. As mentioned earlier, custodian capture must be created on the turn of the player performing the capture, and in this case the enemy player did not create the custodian capture on his or her turn. One of the enemy pieces must move away, and then return to the same position to capture the sandwiched piece if the opportunity is still available. ** Similarly, if a piece moves next to a friendly piece and both these pieces are sandwiched between two enemy pieces on the same row or column (with no vacant space between any two of them), then neither of the two sandwiched pieces are captured. One of the enemy pieces must move away, and then return to the same position to capture the sandwiched pieces if the opportunity is still available. * The captured pieces are removed from the board at the end of each turn. * Two custodian captures can be performed in one turn. Only one such general case exist, and it involves a row and a column: ** A piece that moves between two enemy pieces in such a way that one of the enemy pieces is on the same row, and the other enemy piece is on the same column, and that each enemy piece is flanked on the other side by a friendly piece of the same row or column respectively (with no vacant space between any of them), this is cause for the capture of the two enemy pieces. This case can be extended to cover a line of two adjacent enemy pieces either on a row or column. * A player wins if he or she reduces the other player's pieces to one, or stalemates opposing pieces by not allowing them to move on their turn. An opponent with only one piece left is not a threat as it can no longer perform a custodian capture or initiate a stalemate.

Valiamma also known as Meme Veronique or Veronica married at a very early age to a young man by the name of Matrizan and adapted to the French society. They had a daughter together Anise. Problems arose between Valiamma and Matrizan's family, and Valiamma left Martinique with her daughter Anise who was 3 at the time, her mother Peruammal, and sister Alice around 1888 to arrive in Trinidad, where she worked with the De Boissiere family who owned the Champs Elysee Estate in Maraval, Trinidad and Tobago. Tamil, being her mother tongue she spoke French, English, and the lingua franca of Indo-Trinidadians, Hindustani fluently. Valiamma mastered in French culinary and was taught by her mother the art of massage. Her abilities were so high in demand Valiamma built a great relationship with her clients and hosted parties and massage sessions. Shortly after her arrival to Trinidad Valiamma was around twenty when she was approached by a young Tamil Indian immigrant who settled in Trinidad and Tobago by the name of Narain The two made an excellent match and Peruammal Valiamma's mother had arranged for them to marry and settle at her home on cotton hill. Narain had adopted Anise Valiamma's daughter from her first marriage and they together had several children of whom seven survived. In order was: Julia, Victorine Known as Coopai or Sonny Ma, Mayotte, Edmund Known as Big Mammay, Emelda Known as Chuparee or Chennai Pati, John Known as Chinna Dada or Chinna Thamby, and Marie Louise (known as Susi). They all had Western and French names due to Valiamma being Roman Catholic. Alice Valiama's younger sister met a young man by the name of Gosine and settled in Todd's Road, Rio Claro, Trinidad and Tobago. Around 1900 Anise was a 15 years of age, she married a young man just 18 by the name of Tamby Pillai. Tamby's father Shiva Subromaniam Pillai who had emigrated to Trinidad and Tobago from the city of Coimbatore in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu on the John Allen Ship in 1873. They had eight children in order, Pulleh, Babe, Armogam known as (Edward Joseph), Christo, Rita known as (Little Ma), Lucile, Elsie, and Sylvan born 1925. Valiamma's mother grew old and they had to care for her. Some time after 1914 Peruammal died and was given a traditional Tamil Hindu funeral, a horse- drawn hearse proceeded by drummers and pennies thrown in front of the moving hearse and collected by mourners with sacred prayers by the Pujari (Priest), She wasn't cremated as per Hindu customs, but buried at Lapeyrouse Cemetery, due to the ban of cremation in the British Empire. Suddenly after the birth of Valiamma's last child Susi, Narain died leaving her with their seven children and none were adults yet. Times were tough, but as usual Valiamma supported her family with her profession of Culinary and Masseuse and she also bought cows to generate dairy for sale. As Valiamma's children got older they all married Julia to Lutchman and they had 8 children Gabriel, Nashug, Anthony, Prince, Edward, Kami, Mary, And Rita. Victorine to Chubbiah, and they had three children, Patricia known as Batee,William known as Sonny, and David Paul Known as Boyin.

It is a single-seat, single-engine, all-metal airplane typically powered by a 1/2 VW engine in the 32 hp-45 hp range although other engines have been used successfully. It is built from plans, but many of the components are available pre-made from Hummel Aviation. Examples have been built for less than $4,000 with extensive \\"scrounging\\", but with all new material and a pre-built engine, a more likely figure would be $8,000‚Äì$10,000.  Development  Hummel Bird with half-VW engine Hummel Bird with custom AeroMorph engine and round cowl 1/2 Volkswagen engine mounted in a Hummel Bird The Hummel Bird is a derivative of an earlier design known as the Parker Teenie Two. Originally designed by Calvin Parker, the design was featured in Popular Mechanics May 1971. Plans for the Teenie Two were originally offered for sale in 1969 and are still offered today with more than 12,000 sets sold.http://roweaviation.com/documents/airplanes.html The next generation of the design was called the Watson GW-1 Windwagon. Designed by Gary Watson, the windwagon shares a great deal of the design elements of the Teenie Two and debuted at the Experimental Aircraft Association fly-in in Oshkosh, Wisconsin in 1978. The most obvious variation from the Teenie Two is in the fuselage. The Windwagon fuselage is smaller and is essentially a union of two cones. One that starts at the seat back and tapers to the back bulkhead and another that tapers forward of the seat back to the firewall. This design element would carry on to the Hummel Bird. In the fall of 1979, Morry Hummel, who worked in the Curtis Wright experimental department during World War II, purchased the plans for Gary Watson's Windwagon and the development of the \\"Hummel Bird\\" began. Because of the weather in Hummel's state of Ohio, a canopy was needed. The horizontal stabilizer attach construction was redesigned. The seat back was raised 5 inches so a shoulder harness could be added, and the instrument panel was raised 2 inches, increasing fuel capacity and leg room. The wing was completely re-engineered. The dihedral break on the Windwagon was in the middle; Morry made the center wing section straight and put the dihedral break at the point where the outer wing panels bolt to the center section. The Hummel Bird spar is built up of 1/8 6061-t6 aluminum angle spar caps, with a .040, 2024-t3 spar web. The spar cap angles are doubled in the center section, and tapered in the outer panels. The number of ribs was increased, the thickness of the skin was reduced, and the skins get even thinner toward the tips. The ribs are now a two piece design with one in front of the spar(nose rib) and one between the spars(main rib). The skins are riveted to the spars leaving no bump where the one piece ribs previously pushed the skin up where it crossed the spar. Both the Teenie Two and the Windwagon had tricycle landing gear, however, Morry preferred conventional landing gear so taildragger gear became a popular option. There were other changes as well, compromising a significant improvement over the wind wagon. He finished his project in July 1980. In July 1982, the plane was featured in an article written by Jack Cox, of Sport Aviation. Jack dubbed Morry's new creation the ‚ÄúHummel Bird‚Äù and the name stuck. Originally builders had to buy Windwagon plans as well as Hummel's modifications and try to incorporate the two. This proved very difficult. One of those builders was Bill Spring. An engineer by profession, Spring took a great many photos and consulted with Morry Hummel until he had the complete design. He then created CAD drawings and a builders manual which now comprise the plans package available from Hummel Aviation. Despite the misconception, the Hummel Bird is not an ultralight aircraft in the US. Its empty weight exceeds the specified 254 pounds, it carries more than 5 gallons of fuel, it stalls at a speed above 24 knots, and its top speed is well beyond the ultralight limit of 55 knots. In Canada it does meet the requirements for a Basic Ultralight Aeroplane.  Variations  Some notable variations of the aircraft include: Fuel: The standard location of the fuel tank is forward of the instrument panel. Some builders have moved it to the leading edges of the wings. By creating a sealed leading edge tank, the fuel is moved away from the pilot for better crash survivability with the added benefit of more than doubling the fuel capacity. Fuselage: The plans state that a builder can increase the width and/or height of the bulkheads in an effort to make the fuselage more hospitable for larger pilots. Engines: The standard engine for the design is the four-stroke, 1/2 VW engine, an engine literally made by cutting the block of a standard four-cylinder VW engine in half. After machining and welding, the remaining two-cylinder engine is light and powerful. Alternative engines include the more powerful but heavier four- cylinder VW engine, the two-stroke Rotax 447, and even the McCulloch 0-100-1 drone engine popular with the early gyrocopter builders.

Family chronicle The first recorded individual bearing the name was Conradus de Gorsne who was recorded as a ‚Äúwitness‚Äù on 22 June 1186. The first recorded ancestor of the living von G√∂rschen descendants was Petris de G√∂rsene (first mentioned on 12 June 1271) and the family distributed across Prussia in the course of the next few generations. Due to the marriage of Eva von G√∂rschen, daughter of Lorenz von G√∂rschen (1575‚Äì1630), Lord of Gro√ü-G√∂rschen, with Erasmus von Bothfeld, Lord of Burgwerben, the family von G√∂rschen belong to the ancestors of some European royal and noble houses. stately home Auligk, domain of the family between 1650 and 1914 Captain Georg Christoph von G√∂rschen From Captain Georg Christoph von G√∂rschen (1707‚Äì1748) there was the development of three main lines; a line in the area around Auligk/Groitzsch and F√ºrstenwalde still exists to this day, while a second line originating on the German-Dutch border near Aachen, and a third line in the Neuruppin area were also recorded. From the second line originated a number of family members in especially important administrative posts. After the middle of the 19th century some of them settled down in London and were successful business people there. As Protestants, many of the members of this line also were honorary knights or members of the Order of St. John, which is the German Protestant branch of the Knights Hospitaller. The third line held several generations of high-ranking officers who achieved honours for their military merits. In today's society the name has all but vanished; less than fifteen bearers of the name survive to this day.

It is endemic to eastern Australia. It has become an environmental weed in some countries. Description Hakea sericea is a large spreading, bushy shrub and may grow to and does not form a lignotuber. The branchlets are densely covered in grey-whitish short, soft, woolly hairs. The inflorescence appear in umbels of 1-6 flowers in leaf axils, pinkish in bud and maturing to white. The inflorescence rachis is long and thickly covered in woolly, short, matted white hairs toward the end and rusty coloured at the base. The pedicels are long, slight to densely covered with long white hairs. The smooth perianth is long and the pistil long. The needle-shaped leaves are grooved on the undersurface and up to long and wide and ending in a sharp point long. The leaves are moderately covered with flattened silky hairs, quickly becoming smooth. The fruit are rough and coarsely wrinkled with a network of veins on the surface, long and wide ending with a short, broad beak to long. Taxonomy and naming Hakea sericea was first formally described by Heinrich Adolph Schrader and Johann Christoph Wendland in 1797 and published the description in Sertum Hannoveranum. The genus Hakea is named after Baron von Hake, patron of botany in the 18th century. Sericea meaning silky, referring to the tiny hairs on young growth. Distribution and habitat Silky hakea is found from the coast and adjacent ranges of south-eastern Queensland to south-eastern New South Wales. A frost tolerant species, grows in well-drained soil and full sun. A good habitat plant due to its prickly habit and winter flowering. It is also naturalised in Victoria and possibly South Australia.

It was subsequently published in a book along with nos 1 and 2, Soldiers Three (1888) and The Story of the Gadsbys, as Soldiers Three (1899). The characters about whom the stories are concerned are native Indians, rather than the British for writing about whom Kipling may be better known; four of the stories are narrated by the Indians, and four by an observant wise English journalist (the persona that Kipling likes to adopt). The stories are: *\\"Dray Wara Yow Dee\\" - told by an Afghan (Pathan) narrator *\\"The Judgement of Dungara\\" - told by an English narrator *\\"At Howli Thana\\" - told by an Indian narrator *\\"Gemini\\" - told by an Indian narrator *\\"At Twenty-Two\\" - told by an English narrator *\\"In Flood Time\\" - told by an Indian narrator *\\"The Sending of Dana Dee\\" - told by an English narrator *\\"On the City Wall\\" - told by an English narrator  \\"Dray Wara Yow Dee\\"  This story details a Pathan man who runs across paths with his unnamed, English friend whom he calls ‚ÄúSahib‚Äù throughout the story. The narrator tells the Sahib a story about his wife who was of the Abazai tribe, whom he married to bring peace amongst the Pathan and Abazai. One day, he tells his wife he will be gone fifteen days, but is only gone twelve. Upon returning one night, he hears a man singing: ‚ÄúDray wara yow dee‚Äù or ‚Äúall three are one.‚Äù The narrator tries to sneak up on the pair, but a rock slides under his foot, and the man, an Abazai man named Daoud Shah, runs away, fearing for his life. The Pathan man confronts his wife who confirms she loved the other man and laughs in his face. The narrator decapitates her and throws her into the Kabul River. The narrator then explains to the Sahib his trip so far in chasing Daoud Shah, and how close he has gotten. He explains hearing the devil tell him where to go, and ignores the Sahib when he reminds him of the laws. Frequently the narrator will return to the saying ‚ÄúDray wara yow dee‚Äù in what comes off as madness. The story ends with the storyteller claiming that his running into the Sahib was a good omen; that he shall find Daoud Shah soon.  \\"The Judgement of Dungara\\"  German missionary Justus Krenk and his wife come to the world of Buria Kol to spread the ways of Christianity and proper western societal traditions. High Priest Athon Daz√©, of the Temple of Dungara, resents their efforts to change the ways of the people. After converting forty members of Buria Kol, the Krenk's plan a ceremony to celebrate. With plans to make white clothes for the new converts, Athon Daz√© suggests a plant that grows all around the Buria Kol for the fibers of the cloth. Grateful, Justus Krenk crafts the outfits accordingly. When the day of the ceremony arrives, the new members start to complain of a burning pain and run for the river, wishing to return to the shield of the God Dungara. Daz√© has tricked the Krenks into using poisonous plants to make the cloth, thus making it seem like the God Dungara's revenge. The Krenk's return to Europe in defeat.  \\"At Howli Thana\\"  Another story told solely through direct dialogue, ‚ÄúAt Howli Thana‚Äù is about a Pathan man named Afzal Khan, who is seeking a job from an Englishman‚Äîin doing so he describes his previous job as a policeman at the Howli Thana, where many dishonest officers worked‚Äîuntil discovered by an English officer called Yunkum Sahib. In his retelling, Afzal Khan claims that one night, while the men slept at their post, an unknown individual came in and robbed the station of their weaponry and record book. To cover the mistake, they stage an elaborate story by destroying the post‚Äîonly to find that the thief was Yunkum Sahib himself.  \\"Gemini\\"  ‚ÄúGemini‚Äù is a plea to the English justice system from a man named Durga Dass, against his twin brother (whom is younger by ‚Äúfull three breaths‚Äù) Ram Dass. Both bunnia or money lenders, the brothers begin working on the street of Isser Jang. Durga Dass, works honestly and makes little money, whereas Ram Dass is sneaky, and tricks a man only known to the reader as ‚Äúlandholder,‚Äù into a debt that can only be paid by giving Ram Dass all his land. Infuriated, the landholder sends men to attack Ram Dass, but instead mistakes Durga Dass for him. Beating him close to death, Durga Dass is left helpless, until his brother promises him to take care of him and seek revenge. Taking Durga Dass to their aunt for care, Ram Dass also inquires about any possessions he should recover from Durga Dass's home and asserts that he will press on for revenge from the justice system for his brother, Durga Dass thanks him and falls into a sickly sleep for several days. Upon awakening, Durga Dass realizes all of his possessions are gone, as are his brother and aunt. The townspeople are surprised to see Durga Dass, and shame him for having been tricked.  \\"At Twenty-Two\\"  An old, coal mining, blind man named Janki Meah has recently taken a new young, beautiful wife named Unda, as a result of selling the oil given to him by the mining company. Unfortunately, Unda is in love with Kundoo, a man who works with her husband. One day there is a flood in the mines, and it traps both Janki Meah and Kundoo, along with other members of their ‚Äúgang‚Äù and ten basket women are trapped inside their galleries. Luckily, Janki Meah, in his blindness, has familiarized himself with the mines and leads the group to an alternative route to freedom. As a result, Janki Meah gets his pension, but his wife Unda still leaves him for Kundoo in the end.  \\"In Flood Time\\"  An Englishman is angrily held up on his journey by a flood, and takes refuge with a man living by the ford, who frequently helps people cross the river. During the Englishman's stay, the man tells him of when he was young and strong, and in love with a Hindi girl from across the river. Although they could not marry, they would frequently meet in a field‚Äîand one day when they planned to meet, this man swam through a flood like no other to meet her. By the end of the story, the flood waters have resided, and the man tells the Englishman to hurry so that he can cross the river before the levels rise again.  \\"The Sending of Dana Da\\"  Dana Da is supposedly a man who has abilities beyond any religious comprehension‚Äîbut is best when aided with opium and whiskey. Having heard this, an Englishman pays the man ten rupees, and Dana Da promises to send a Sending to a man whom he hates, Lone Sahib. Knowing that the Lone Sahib hates cats, Dana Da has kittens mysteriously appear over a span of several days, in random places in the Lone Sahib's path. The Englishman hears of this and asks how he does it‚Äîthe Dana Da on his deathbed explains the elaborate trick, in which a man he knows who works with the Lone Sahib places kittens from his village in the Lone Sahib's way.  \\"On The City Wall\\"  Lalun, a beautiful and talented woman, lives and entertains along the city way of Lahore. Visited by many men, one named Wali Dad is especially friendly. Wali Dad has had an English education and feel uncomfortably places between the European and English worlds. As the story continues, the reader gets an introduction to a leader Khem Singh, someone who may disrupt British rule in India. Khem Singh has been imprisoned though, but escapes. A riot breaks out and Lalun helps an old man out of the riot through her window. She asks the narrator to assistance getting him through the city safely, and he agrees, only to later realize it is Khem Singh. He returns the man to captivity and the rebellion ceases.  Common Themes Seen in \\"In Black and White\\" = Revenge  In several of Kipling's stories within his collection of In Black and White, revenge is the basis of the plotline. Within ‚ÄúDray Wara Yow Dee,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Judgement of Dungara,‚Äù and ‚ÄúGemini,‚Äùactions of the primary characters are greatly fueled by the act of revenge. Each character motivated by revenge is an Indian character‚Äîbut whether or not that was intended by Kipling is unknown.  European Ignorance  In two stories within this collection, Kipling criticizes the ignorance of European colonizers of Indian life. This can be seen with the missionaries in ‚ÄúThe Judgement of Dungara‚Äù and the acts of the British in ‚ÄúOn the City Wall.‚Äù  Narrative Styles  Within In Black and White, Kipling utilizes two recurring ways of telling his stories depending on the race of the narrator. For example, in the stories in which the narrator is not white, the reader gets only words from that speaker's mouth, with little to no dialogue. The narrator is also always speaking to an Englishman, from whom we never get a direct quotation. This can be seen in \\"Dray Wara Yow Dee,\\" \\"At Howli Thana,\\" \\"Gemini,\\" and \\"In Flood Time.\\" Other stories are instead told from the perspective of a third person speaker, there is a more traditional layout of the story, with dialogue, characters, clear storyline, etcetera. This is seen in \\"The Judgement of Dungara,\\" \\"At Twenty- Two,\\" \\"The Sending of Dana Da,\\" and \\"On the City Wall.\\" References Category:1888 short story collections Category:Short story collections by Rudyard Kipling Category:Rudyard Kipling stories about India Category:A H Wheeler & Co books ","title":"In Black and White (short story collection)"},{"id":"18767894","text":"Sweet Water Canal, also known as Fresh Water Canal and currently known as Isma√Ølia Canal, is a canal which was dug by thousands of Egyptian fellahin to facilitate the construction of the Suez Canal.

The canal facilitated the growth of agriculture settlements along the Suez Canal, and it is particularly important for supplying water to the city of Port Said.

Construction In February 1862, after thousands of workers excavated 1.1 million cubic meters, the canal reached Lake Timsah. As soon as the fresh water reached the area, more labourers were hired for the Suez Canal construction project. The canal also allowed for the easy transportation of materials and food with ferries traveling along its narrow ways. Battle of Kassassin Lock The Battle of Kassassin Lock was fought near Sweet Water Canal, on August 28, 1882. Anglo-Egyptian War Less than 100 years later, the canal no longer provided clean, fresh water but was disturbingly polluted. During the 1950s when British soldiers were stationed in the area, some referred to the canal as an open sewer. Royal Air Force personnel were advised to avoid contact with the water and were warned that the canal was where deserters would end up. When the war became especially bloody, between national, Egyptian, resistance movements and British soldiers, from October 1951 to January 1952, the remains of some of the British soldiers who were tortured and killed, ended up in the canal.

He received his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Utah, and his Juris Doctor degree from the university's law school, earning his law school tuition by working in the mines in Bingham, Utah. He started his career as a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation spending 12 years with that agency, in Washington, D.C.; El Paso, Texas; Kansas City, Missouri; and Los Angeles. He rose to head the criminal investigative section of the Bureau's Los Angeles field office, resigning in 1952. He spent a year in the private sector, taking a position as chief of security for the Richfield Oil Company, before becoming Under-Sheriff reporting to sheriff Eugene Biscailuz. He was elected Sheriff in 1958 upon Biscailuz's retirement. During his 23 years as sheriff, he eliminated the county's informal posse comitatus, introduced the use of helicopters for car chases and crowd control, and set up the Special Enforcement Detail, one of the first SWAT teams in the United States. He linked the geographically separated offices and jails with Teletype machines for faster communication, and computerized the offices records in the 1960s. He also put in place a program allowing smaller communities to contract with the sheriff's department as an alternative to establishing their own police departments. Upon his retirement, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors designated him as \\"sheriff emeritus for the rest of his life.\\" In addition to his law enforcement work, Pitchess served on the Los Angeles County Civil Defense and Disaster Commission during the nuclear crisis in the early 1960s. The position was important because it was at the time of the peak of the cold war nuclear scare. Death and legacy Pitchess died at his home in Newport Beach on April 4, 1999 at the age of 87, from heart failure. He is buried in Pacific View Memorial Park in Corona del Mar, California. His name is well known as a party in a famous California legal case entitled Pitchess v. Superior Court,Pitchess v. Superior Court, 11 Cal.3d 531 (1974) which entitles a defendant to obtain records of public complaints, using what is now known as a Pitchess motion, about the use of excessive force by police officers. Pitchess' office had claimed that such records were proprietary, and had refused to provide them following a subpoena duces tecum. His petition was ultimately denied by the California Supreme Court in a 7-0 decision. The Peter J. Pitchess Detention Center in Los Angeles County is named after him.

It contains collections and artefacts related to the maritime history of South Africa and the South African Navy. History The South African Naval Museum at the South African Navy's base in Simon's Town dates back to 1966 when a naval historical collection was displayed at the Castle of Good Hope Military Museum in Cape Town. In the mid 1970s this collection was transferred to the Martello Tower in Simon's Town and, thereafter, to Fort Wynyard where it was enlarged to include a much wider display of naval associated artifacts. With the decentralisation of Museums from the former South African Defence Forces Director Military Museums to the various Arms of Service in June 1987, the South African Navy Museum (Martello Tower) was transferred to the functional control of the South African Navy, while Fort Wynyard was transferred to Western Province Command (Army). Investigations into the establishment of a museum for the South African Navy in Simon's Town were launched during 1988 and it was eventually decided that the most appropriate location for the new museum would be the former Royal Navy Mast House that dates back to 1815 and the adjacent Dutch Store House that dates back to 1743. Both buildings are located in the historic West Yard of Naval Base Simon's Town. The new South African Naval Museum was opened by Chief of the Navy, Vice Admiral Robert Simpson-Anderson, on 1 April 1993. The first phase of the new display comprised exhibitions of the historic clock tower and part of the sail loft. The second phase of the development included the utilisation of two display areas on ground level with the history and functioning of the Submarine, Divers and Weapons branch suitably displayed. The South African Navy (SAN) themselves were involved in the conversion of the building to that of a museum.Steyn, L., 'Military Museums in the Department of Defence' (Thesis, University of Pretoria, 2009) Displays=Chiefs of the Navy display Chiefs of the Navy display The museum's collections include portraits of all nine of the previous Chiefs of the South African Navy, ranging from Admiral Hugo Biermann to Vice Admiral Johan Retief. Gunnery display Mk 6M Gun Director A Mk 6M Gun Director is shown, originally fitted to the President-class Type 12 frigates that were in service with the South African Navy between 1959 and 1985. The two radar oval shaped nacelles contained the Type 275 radar; one nacelle for transmitting and the other for receiving. The returned signal provided the range and distance of the target. The analogue computers in the transmitting station would calculate the aim-off and pass on to the selected guns (normally the 4.5 inch gun) for the correct bearing and elevation. Torpedo and Anti-Submarine display This exhibit includes a Westland Wasp helicopter. In October 1963, the first of sixteen Wasp helicopters were delivered to the South African Air Force. Wasp 85 on display was taken on charge on 25 May 1964 and was issued to 22 Flight (later re-designated 22 Squadron SAAF) at AFS Ysterplaat. Two South African Navy destroyers, the and were converted to carry helicopter in 1964 and 1966 respectively and fitted with a flight-deck and hangar. Similarly the President (Modified Type 12) class frigates , and were also converted to carry a single Wasp helicopter to be used in an anti-submarine or survey role. The hydrographic survey vessel and fleet replenishment vessel carried the Wasp helicopter in similar fashion. Of the sixteen helicopters delivered, six were lost in service. One particular Wasp that ditched at sea off Milnerton was salvaged and rebuilt to fly again. The Wasps were eventually withdrawn from SAAF service in 1990. Wasp 85 on display, was donated to the South African Naval Museum in Simon's Town in 2003 from the South African Air Force Museum at Ysterplaat. General Botha display Model of the TS General Botha at the naval museum This exhibit focuses on the South African Training Ship General Botha (ex ) and its successors, the South African Nautical College GENERAL BOTHA and the South African Merchant Navy Academy GENERAL BOTHA. As a training establishment, GENERAL BOTHA functioned for 67 years to educate and prepare young men as officers for South Africa's Merchant Service and Navy and until 1961, for the British Navy too. GENERAL BOTHA was unquestionably the ‚Äúcradle‚Äù of both the South African Navy and the South African Merchant Service. Transformation display The Transformation display at the museum The Transformation Display at the SA Naval Museum was officially opened by Flag Officer Fleet, Rear Admiral Bubele Mhlana on Wednesday 11 March 2015. The project was initiated by Vice Admiral Refiloe Johannes Mudimu shortly after his appointment as Chief of the Navy in 2005. The task was given to the Naval Museum to provide a new display that will tell the story of the transformation of race and gender in the South African Navy through the years. Its purpose was to provide a much needed balance of our history that would make the SA Naval Museum more representative of the entire Navy and its people, as we see it today. The Transformation Display focuses on important landmark events that saw the transformation of the South African Navy, through the years: *The first non-Europeans serving in the naval forces during the Second World War *The involvement of African dockyard workers in Simon's Town through the years *The first appointment of Coloured people into the South African Navy during the 1960s *The inclusion of women in uniform during the early 1970s *The formation of the Indian Training Battalion and SAS Jalsena during the 1970s *The integration of Non Statutory Forces, Umkhonto we Sizwe and the Azanian People's Liberation Army into the South African Navy after 1994 Interwoven with these historic events are the stories of many individuals that lived and died ... *The tragic story of *The valour of Job Maseko during the Second World War *The sad loss of Cape Corps members off Kalkbay in 1965 *The achievements of women in the South African Navy *Umkhonto we Sizwe training in Russia *The South African Navy's integration success story at and the South African Naval College Museum of Submarine Technology A major exhibit of the museum's is the SAS Assegaai, a Daphn√© class submarine. It is the first and thus far only South African Navy submarine to have been converted into a museum ship. The submarine is currently closed to the public, pending plans for her placement ashore. Opening Hours The museum is open seven days a week, daily opening times 09:30-15:30 except Good Friday, Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Entry is free of charge, but a voluntary donation towards the SA Naval Museum Fund can be made at the reception.

It was released on November 11, 2008, by Hollywood Records. The 12-track album consists of eight of Duff's previous singles, as well as two new recordings: \\"Reach Out\\" and \\"Holiday\\", and two remixes to the songs. Only one single was released from the album, the Ryan \\"Alias\\" Tedder- produced \\"Reach Out\\", which became her third single to chart at number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play. Despite being a greatest hits album, her singles \\"Someone's Watching Over Me\\", \\"Our Lips Are Sealed\\" and \\"Beat of My Heart\\" aren't included in the standard edition of the album. Background Duff confirmed that she had collaborated with a rapper called Prophet on a previously unheard song on the Dignity tour's set list, \\"Reach Out\\" in September 2007. In an interview with remix producer Joe Bermudez in November 2007, she said that Dignity would be re-released in a CDVU+ edition featuring remixes of the original songs alongside two new tracks: \\"Reach Out\\" and \\"Holiday\\". Duff said she hoped to write a third new song for the re-release, and to have \\"Holiday\\" released as its first or second single; However, Hollywood Records scrapped the plans, adding to their large list of cancelations, which in turn led Duff to make the decision to leave the label and develop Best of Hilary Duff to quickly end her contract, which had expected one more album. Unlike Duff's first compilation album Most Wanted (2005), which was advertised as strictly a compilation, Best of was strictly advertised as a greatest hits, making it her first. Critical reception Best of Hilary Duff received mostly mixed reviews from critics. Allmusic gave the album a positive review stating that Best of Hilary Duff \\"is a flipside of her 2005's Most Wanted\\", which was \\"pitched squarely at bright, happy tweens\\". They also went on to say the album \\"is not a look back at the past but a blueprint for the future\\". Allmusic gave the album a 3.5/5 star rating. Commonsensemedia said that \\"parents need to know that Miss Duff has turned up the heat with sexually provocative lyrics that may be too hot to handle for younger fans. Hilary Duff isn't for tweens anymore. The hit single \\"Reach Out\\" features more aggressive sexual lyrics than on previous albums. While Dignity was OK for 11-year-olds, the Best Of compilation pushes the target age higher. The funky remixes and danceable electronic beats are fun and catchy, but the sexed-up lyrics and themes aren't intended for younger fans.\\" Rachel Devitt of Rhapsody said the collection \\"is largely pleasant, nicely polished and, rather surprisingly, sleek and even a little edgy. Turns out Lizzie McGuire is a dancefloor diva, and even with that feathery little voice, she manages to work it on tracks like the dark \\"Stranger,\\" saucy new tune \\"Reach Out\\" and a clubby remix of \\"Dignity.\\" Commercial performance On November 29th 2008, Best of Hilary Duff debuted at number 125 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 5,500 copies in its first week of release in the US, making it her least successful album to date. Many people believe this was due to a lack of promotion from her record label at the time Hollywood Records and her change in sound of music which many believe resulted in Duff losing some of her younger fans. This is her first album not to receive any RIAA certifications. As of September 2012, the album has sold over 35,000 copies in the United States alone. Singles \\"Reach Out\\" was released as the only single from the album. The music video is directed by Philip Andelman and five official versions were released (though some have leaked first).

Military career and merits  Much like his father lieutenant colonel August Friedrich von G√∂rschen (1794‚àí1866), Otto Friedrich Ferdinand von G√∂rschen firstly took up a career as a commissioned officer in the 24th regiment in the German infantry from the 6th Division, and was promoted there in 1864 to the position of Captain and Chief of the 6th Company. On 16 January 1866 he was promoted to become a Major, and at the same time he was posted to the 8th Brandenburg infantry Regiment of Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia (1828-1885) from the same Division. Otto von G√∂rschen was instrumental in the Second Schleswig War in 1864 Battle of Dybb√∏l during the transition to Alsen Battle of Als and the assault to the D√ºppeler Schanzen (rempal of Dybb√∏l). For his previous merits, inter alia, he was decorated as follows: * House Order of Hohenzollern with swords * Order of the Red Eagle with swords * Prussian Order of the Crown with swords * Order of the Iron Crown of Austria According to rankings of 1868, Otto von G√∂rschen and Alfred von Lewinski (1831-1906) were the only officers in the Prussian Army with the above three swords. As commander of the Second Battalion of the Brandenburg Infantry Regiment, he later was a recipient of the Iron Cross first class. After two injuries in 1864 and 1870, and incipient disease from 1872, he was exempted from military service. He was married to Emma Clara Helene Riedel (1845‚àí1924), daughter of the archivist, historian and politician Adolph Friedrich Johann Riedel (1809-1872). From this marriage three children were born.

In the service of Aachen and Munich insurance company  After his law studies, von G√∂rschen planned to pursue a career as a judge. He was already an assistant lawyer in the regional court when he decided, in 1861 to enter in the Aachen and Munich Fire Insurance Company, a predecessor organization of today's Aachen M√ºnchener Versicherungs-AG (a subsidiary company of the AMB Generali). First, he took over for two years as head of the Subdirektion Berlin before he finally (in 1863) was appointed as a legal officer in the Aachen headquarters. He held this post for seventeen years and was already a consultative member of the Board of directors. On 9 April 1881, he was appointed as a full member and from 1887 until his death he served as Chairman of the Board of Directors. He was the representative of the insurance company both internally and externally, and under his leadership, the company developed a towering reputation. During this time, Robert von G√∂rschen (thanks to his extraordinary gift of giving speeches, and numerous contacts) was instrumental in instigating a spate of tremendous achievements in the German and international businesses, this insurance company acquired. He was playing a key role in building until 1900, with over 56 new foreign representatives of his company, but also in the planning and implementation of projects for funding of social and cultural institutions in the region. In these early years of the industrial age, he worked vigorously for the social component of support from the Insurance Company. He ensured that each half of the annual profit should be reserved for social and cultural purposes, as the founder of the company, David Hansemann (1790-1864), had decreed in 1824. Due to Robert von G√∂rschen's co-operation with General Director Friedrich Adolph Br√ºggemann, it was also possible that the Friedrich-Wilhelm Foundation of the University of Aachen (today RWTH Aachen), could be founded (in 1866) and that a secure financial footing was guaranteed. The Friedrich-Wilhelm Foundation continues until the present day, awarding scholarships and prizes for research. In 1870, the university also received a guarantee fund in the amount of 1.3 million Mark (Prussian vereinsthaler) and a construction fund of a further one million Mark annually, and 10,000 Mark as earmarked grants. This enabled von G√∂rschen and Friedrich Adolph Br√ºggemann (on 10 October 1870) to found the organization \\"Association for the advancement of capacity of work\\", a kind of labour office of that time. In addition, both also supported the fire insurance companies in many towns and cities throughout the Rhineland in 1870, in the acquisition of one free fire syringe engine for each (of the company Josef Beduwe, Feuerspritzen, Gelb- und Glockengie√üerei (fire engine, brass and bell foundry) from Aachen, which resulted in a sell of this equipment for over 5000 Marks. Robert von Gorschen and the subsequent directors of the insurance company, Richard Trostorff and Adolf Br√ºggemann, were significantly responsible for ensuring that the Aachen Einhard-Gymnasium (on 1 May 1886) and the Aachen David Hansemann Monument, together with the area surrounding the monument (on 29 August 1888) and the Aachen Bismarck Tower (on 22 August) could all be inaugurated.  The services of the Eschweiler Coal Mining Company (EBV)  Robert von G√∂rschen, at the recommendation of his father (privy councillor Karl Heinrich von G√∂rschen, (1784-1860)), became the chairman of the supervisory board of Eschweiler coal mining company (EBV), and he also became a member of the Executive Council of the EBV. On 26 October 1897 he was chosen to be a member of the Supervisory Board, and from 1907 to 1909 he became deputy chairman, and until his death in 1914 he filled the position of chairman of this body. At that time the various mines around Aachen and in neighbouring countries were individual companies and no longer competitive in the growing market. Due to Robert von G√∂rschen, in 1907 a merger between the Associations for Mineral Coal Company (Vereinigungsgesellschaft f√ºr Steinkohlenbau im Wurmrevier), further individual mines and the Eschweiler Coal Mining Company (EBV) the EBV became one of the biggest mine companies of Western Germany. He was also honoured in 1903 by the City W√ºrselen, by having the main shaft of the mine Gouley and according to Council Decision of 21 November 1953 an adjacent street named after him.  Further activities and honours  Robert von G√∂rschen was, between 1884 and 1909 Municipal city councillor of Aachen. In addition, from 31 January 1864 he joined the Aachener Casino association and was (initially in 1886 and most recently from 1902 to 1909) its president. For his achievements, he was decorated as follows: * Order of the Red Eagle 3rd class with swords * Order of the Crown of Prussia, 2nd class * Merit Order of the St Michael of Bavaria, 2nd class * House Order of Henry the Lion of Brunswick, 2nd class * House Order of Vigilance or the White Falcon, 2nd, class  Family  Robert Oskar Julius von G√∂rschen was born to the old German noble family Von G√∂rschen. He originated from the estate Gut Klau in Aachen, and was married to Elise Helene Friederike Br√ºggemann (1833-1917) and had with her four sons and two daughters. His son Robert Walter Richard Ernst von G√∂rschen became Vice-President in Aachen and another son, Bruno Hans Otto Friedrich von G√∂rschen (1865-1939) became a Judicial and Legal councillor of justice, in 1914 a legal advisor in the ‚ÄúAachen and Munich Insurance Company‚Äù, and in 1924 chairman of the Supervisory Board of Aachen Reinsurance Company.

He served as the President of the Chamber of Deputies of Chile from March 13, 2008 until his death on August 7, 2008. He was known as an ardent opponent of the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship and the human rights abuses committed by the regime. Bustos lived in exile for 14 years while Chile was ruled by the Pinochet military junta from 1973 until 1990. After his return he played a major role in uncovering cases of human rights abuses. Bustons, a top Chilean law professor and human rights lawyer, represented many of the families of people killed by the Pinochet government. During the Pinochet regime, nearly 3,000 people disappeared, while tens of thousands were arrested and tortured. Bustos represented the family of former Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier, an opponent of Pinochet who was killed by a car bomb in Washington D.C. in 1976. Letelier's assassination was linked to Pinochet military intelligence officials. Bustos was first elected as a legislator in 1998 as a member of the Socialist Party of Chile. He served as President of the Chamber of Deputies of Chile on March 13, 2008, a position he held until his death in August 2008. He died before gaining congressional approval for the creation of a new institute to be tasked with investigating the disappearance of thousands of opponents of the Pinochet regime. Bustos died of liver cancer in Santiago, Chile, on August 7, 2008, at the age of 72. He was survived by his wife and seven children.

It is based on the novel of the same name by \\"Marco Page\\" (Harry Kurnitz). It was followed by two 1939 films featuring the fictional couple, Fast and Loose and Fast and Furious, though they were played by different actors in each. Apparently, cinema distributors were complaining about the time lag between The Thin Man movies, so Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer started this trilogy featuring married amateur sleuths. To avoid confusion with a 1953 MGM film of the same title, Fast Company was rechristened Rare Book Murder for television. Plot Joel and Garda Sloane run a rare book business in New York City. To supplement their meager income, Joel recovers stolen books. Insurance man Steve Langner drops off a check for his latest success. The couple also tries to help Ned Morgan, recently released from prison, find a job; they do not believe he was guilty of the theft of books from dealer Otto Brockler. Ned is in love with Brockler's daughter Leah. Eli Bannerman barges into Otto's office, despite the best efforts of secretary Julia Thorne. Otto is not pleased to see his business associate. He warns Eli that Joel is snooping around, but reluctantly agrees to take another shipment of fake first editions created by Sid Wheeler for $5000. Eli tells Sid that Otto only paid $2000. Incensed, Sid insists on going to see Otto to complain. That night, Otto is struck with a bust sitting on his desk and killed. Ned is the main suspect, especially since he was seen entering the office around the time of the murder. When Sid suggests that Eli might have killed Otto, Eli slugs him. Sid produces a gun, ends their partnership and takes Eli's wallet, full of cash. Joel begins seeing Julia, pretending to be attracted to her in order to try to obtain information. Julia eventually tells him about a secret compartment in the office which holds the books Ned supposedly stole, but Ned is arrested before Joel can notify the police. Meanwhile, Eli convinces Sid that Joel is after him, sure that he is the murderer. Sid shoots at Joel on the sidewalk, but Joel is only hit in the buttocks. Later, Eli kills Sid and takes back his money. Then he hires Danny Scolado and Paul Terison to murder Joel. The two knock Joel out, but do not kill him right away; instead, they tie him up and stash him at a hideout. Having seen how concerned Eli was, Danny talks him into paying more money. In the meantime, Joel frees himself and knocks Paul out. When Danny and Eli return, they spot Garda following them and take her prisoner. Joel is forced to give up his gun, but Garda manages to disconnect the lamp. In the confusion, Eli gets away, while the police arrive and take Danny and Paul into custody. Joel then goes to confront Julia. He has figured out that she killed her boss. Eli shows up with a pistol, but Joel manages to wrestle it away from him and hands him and Julia over to the police.

It is specifically from the Queah tribe. The game is played on a slanted or diagonal square board with only 13 spaces. Pieces move \\"orthogonally\\" along these slanted or diagonal square boards. Another unique feature is that each player must have four (and only four) pieces on the board. Each player's captured piece is resupplied at the beginning of their next turn with a piece from their reserve (unless of course the player has no more pieces to resupply with). The game is somewhat related to draughts, Alquerque, Yote, and Choko. Pieces are captured by the short leap. It is specifically related to Yote and Choko in that pieces are dropped on the board. However, there is no removal of an additional enemy piece when a player captures an enemy piece. Liberian Queah could be considered a \\"game isolate\\". It cannot truly be classified with any other game. The game is also known as Queah. It is uncertain if an official name from the Queah tribe or Liberia exist.  Goal  A player wins when they capture all of their opponent's pieces.  Equipment  A 13 space slanted or diagonal square board is used. Each player has 10 pieces each. One plays the black pieces, and the other plays the white pieces.  Game Play and Rules  1\\\\. Players decide what colors to play, and who starts first. 2\\\\. Players initially place four of their pieces on the four squares nearest them and to their right. Each player's remaining six pieces are set aside next to the board. 3\\\\. Players alternate their turns. Only one piece may be moved or used to capture an enemy piece per turn. 4\\\\. A piece moves one space per turn orthogonally along the slanted or diagonal square board onto a vacant space. 5\\\\. A player's piece can capture an enemy piece by the short leap. The player's piece must be adjacent to the enemy piece, and land on a vacant space on the other side. The capture must be done in an orthogonal direction following the slanted or diagonal design of the board. Only one enemy piece can be captured per turn. A captured piece is removed from the board. 6\\\\. If a player's piece has been captured, then the player at the beginning of his or her next turn must take one piece from their reserve, and drop it on any vacant space. A player's number of pieces on the board must always be restored to four, unless of course the player has exhausted their reserve. Please note though, that a player can only drop a piece from their reserve, if one of their pieces was captured on the opponent's last turn.

It has similar effects to benzodiazepine drugs, but is structurally distinct and so is classed as a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic. It is a subtype-selective, mixed agonist-antagonist at GABAA receptors, which acts as a partial agonist at the Œ±2 and Œ±3 subtypes, but as a silent antagonist at Œ±1 and Œ±5 subtypes. It has primarily anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects in animal tests, but with no sedative effects even at 50 times the effective anxiolytic dose. In human trials on healthy volunteers, TPA-023 was comparable to lorazepam, but had much less side effects on cognition, memory, alertness or coordination. In Phase II trials, the compound was significantly superior to placebo without inducing sedation. The clinical development was halted due to preclinical toxicity (cataract) in long term dosing studies. TPA-023 is well absorbed following oral administration and extensively metabolised by the liver, with a half-life of 6.7 hours. The main enzyme involved in its metabolism is CYP3A4, with some contribution by CYP3A5.

He held various offices in different institutions of the Government of Sri Lanka. At present he is the leader of Sinhalaye Mahasammatha Bhoomiputra Party. During the presidential elections of 1994 and 1999, he was the candidate of that party for this high office. He is the compiler of the Practical Sinhala Dictionary (1982) and Gunasena Great Sinhala Dictionary, which are considered as the most comprehensive Sinhala-Sinhala dictionaries to date. Besides compiling these voluminous works of over 2000 pages, he also proposed scientific ideas to standardise Sinhala script. His political philosophy Mahasammatavada ('Great Consensus' or comprehensive consultation) envisages consulting all people which he described \\"as going beyond democracy\\". He has also appeared for the rights of Sinhalese Buddhists on various fora.  Early life  Harischandra Wijayatunga was born in 1931 at Madamulla in Minuwangoda, Sri Lanka. His father, Wijayatunga Mudalige Don Bastian Wijayatunga, was an Ayurvedic eye physician, landed proprietor and a planter (coconut and paddy) and his mother was Amarawathie Jayasinghe. Wijayatunga was the fourth in a family of eight siblings. Wijayatunga received his elementary education at the Government Bilingual School in Minuwangoda. When the Nalanda College Colombo was relocated to Minuwangoda during the World War II, as a security measure, his parents took the opportunity to shift him to that school. After the War Nalanda College Colombo was taken back to Colombo, and Wijayatnga continued his studies at Nalanda College Colombo. Some of Wijayatunga's notable classmates at Nalanda College were Karunaratne Abeysekera, Dr Hudson Silva, Hon. Dr Dharmasena Attygalle, Hon. Rupa Karunathilake, Ravindra Rupasena and Stanley Jayasinghe. In 1952 he entered the University of Ceylon and in 1955 graduated with a bachelor's degree in science. For his thesis \\"Legal Philosophy in Medieval Sinhale\\" he was awarded the PhD degree by the University of Kelaniya in 1990.  Career  Immediately after his University education, Wijayatunga joined the staff of Dharmaraja College, Kandy as a science teacher. In addition, he also taught Chemistry at the Mahamaya Girls' College, Kandy. It was during this time that he wrote his first book Miridiya Jivihu (Freshwater Life). In 1956 he was appointed as the Editor of the Science Section of the Sinhala Encyclopaedia, established at the University of Peradeniya. After some years of service there, he assumed the post of vice-Principal of his former work place, Dharmaraja College. In 1965 he was appointed to the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) which started work in the same year. He was the first and the only member appointed to the staff, functioning as its Secretary. Under his supervision Divisional Committees on Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Agriculture and Chemicals, and Metrication of Sri Lanka were appointed. The next step he took was to join the Sri Lanka Law College as a student. He took his oaths as an Attorney-at-Law in 1973. He appeared for the accused in the 1971 insurrection before the Criminal Justice Commission. It is also noteworthy that he represented several parties at the Presidential Commission headed by the former Chief Justice Mr. M. C. Sansoni. Throughout the 1980s he held various offices such as Chief Editor of the tabloid Sinhala Bauddhya (The Sinhalese Buddhist), director, Sri Lanka Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation and member of the Directorate of the Siddhayurveda College, Gampaha. During the years 1984‚Äì1990, he was the Editor-in-Chief of the Sinhalese Encyclopaedia as well as the Officer-in-Charge, Sinhala version of the Legislative Enactments of Sri Lanka.  Political career  Wijayatunga's political career goes back to his university days. He joined in the popular movement in 1950s to make Sinhala the Official Language of Sri Lanka, calling into life the \\"Sinhala Union of the University of Ceylon\\". During his stay in Kandy he associated himself with the work of Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Realising that none of the two major parties in Sri Lanka would espouse the rights of Sinhalese Buddhists, which was uppermost in his mind, he established the Sinhalaye Mahasammatha Bhoomiputra Pakshaya in 1990 with a group of intellectuals. He became the leader of this party and holds this position to this date. In the third 1994 Sri Lankan presidential election, he was the candidate of his Party and polled 32,651 votes. Six years later, he contested again in the presidential elections of 1999, polling 35,854 votes. He also contested in the parliamentary elections of 2000, 2001 and 2004.  Personal life  Wijayatunga was married to Kalukapuge Karuna Perera (B.A., Dip. Ed., Attorney-at-Law, Notary Public and Commissioner of Oaths) of Kiribathgoda, who died in 2000. Karuna's father, a Kalukapuge Bandaranaike, adopted the surname Perera during British colonial time. One of the descendant of the male lineage of the Kalukapuge Bandaranaike family is the fourth Prime Minister of Ceylon, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. Karuna's both parents were school principals.

Career  After his graduation in autumn 1884 in Kleve, Robert von G√∂rschen studied law and Political Sciences in Munich, Marburg, Heidelberg and Berlin. Here he passed his first examination in law on 13 May 1888. From 9 June 1888, Robert von G√∂rschen served as a trainee barrister in the District Court of Eschweiler, and was sworn in on 22 June 1888. He completed his internship in Eschweiler at the Country Court in Aachen. On 9 September 1890, he began his career as a junior barrister with the Government of Aachen. Three years after his second examination in law he was appointed as assessor of the government in Aachen, working later with the Government in Kassel, with the district office in Stormarn and probably still with the district office in Wandsbek, before (on 4 November 1895) going back to the government in Kassel. Finally, on 1 August 1902 he was promoted as a governmental councillor. A month later, he worked first as acting and, from 23 February 1903 as a definitive district administrator in Altenkirchen. On 10 October, 1912, he was finally appointed as a chief councillor of government of Cologne. At the last stop of his career, he was promoted, on 1 June 1919, to vice president of government of Aachen. In 1923, he was, together with the President of Aachen, William Rombach (1884-1973), and the Police President Fritz von Korff (1891-1987) captured, due to passive resistance against the supreme authority at that time by Frenchmen and Belgians in the occupied Rhenish Republic. On 23 January 1923, they were released, but with the stipulation that they should not enter certain areas. The ‚ÄúInter-Allied Rhineland Commission‚Äù initially deported them into the unoccupied area around Wuppertal-Elberfeld and were placed, several days later in K√∂nigswinter and Altenkirchen /Westerwald. After constantly travelling back and forth, Aachen President Rombach and his vice president von G√∂rschen finally ended up, in February 1923 in the town hall of Wuppertal- Barmen a branch office of the Government of Aachen and both could now resume their governmental duties. After intensive discussions with the occupying authority, after the end of the struggle under the occupation of the Ruhr, the banishment was withdrawn a year later and von G√∂rschen was, on 12 March 1924 (together with Wolfgang Rombach) again returned to Aachen. Here, Robert von G√∂rschen, now exhausted and frustrated, applied for retirement. This claim was initiated on 1 July 1924.  Additional activities  In addition to his professional career as a high administrative officer, Robert von G√∂rschen was also instrumental in a number of other areas in Aachen, mostly in management positions in various active associations and institutions. These were as follows: * 22 November 1919: member of the Club Casino of Aachen * 1920: member of the ‚Äò‚Äôrecreation society Aachen‚Äô‚Äô * 16 February 1898: Knight of Honor of the Order of St. John, the German branch of the Knights Hospitaller ** 1906: Foreman of the ‚ÄúRhine Cooperative‚Äù of the Knights Hospitaller and Convention member ** 24 June 1908: Knight of Justice of Saint John ** From 1924: also a master at the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Foundation Bonn, today ‚ÄúJohanniter-Hospital‚Äù Bonn * 26 June 1920: to 14 October 1934 Chairman of ‚ÄúLuisen-Hospital‚Äù in Aachen * 9 May 1924: to 4 January 1925: Chairman of the Supervisory Board Aachener und M√ºnchener Fire Insurance Company (predecessor organisation of the AachenM√ºnchener Versicherungs AG, today AMB Generali) and Chairman of the Supervisory Board of AM numerous related companies. * 1927 to 1934: Chairman of the Museum Association of Aachen * 1932 to 1933: President of the Rotary Clubs of Aachen * 1935: appointed councillor of the city of Aachen  Awards  * For his merits in the passive resistance, he was presented, on 22 May 1925, with an honorary citizen certificate. * \\"On the occasion of the return of his seventieth birthday and in grateful appreciation of his great contributions to the design and development of the university\\" von G√∂rschen was, on 27 March 1934, created an honorary senator of the RWTH Aachen. * He was also honoured on 28 March 1934 by the police president in Aachen, by having a street named after him.  Family Robert von G√∂rschen originated from the old German and Thuringia noble family Von G√∂rschen of Protestant-style. He was the son of Robert Oskar Julius von G√∂rschen (1829‚àí1914) and Elise Br√ºggemann (1833‚àí1917). Von G√∂rschen was married to Emy Rosalie Marie Honigmann (1871‚àí1944) and they had one son and one daughter. The son Hans-Wolf von G√∂rschen (1894‚àí1944) was an honorary senator of the University of Greifswald, banker and businessman in Cologne and Rotterdam and a resistance fighter in the ‚ÄúKreisau Circle‚Äù, so he was arrested in December 1944 and in April 1945 was executed by the Gestapo.

Thonissen, Cleef, Jean van in: Biographie nationale de Belgique, Volume 4, p. 141-142 Life Van Cleve was born in Venlo in the duchy of Guelders. Displaying from an early age an interest and facility in art, he went to Brussels where he joined the workshop of the Flemish artist Luigi Primo who had worked for a long period of time in Italy. He is believed to have moved later to the workshop of Gaspard de Crayer. While there is no documentary evidence for such apprenticeship, the stylistic closeness of van Cleve to de Crayer supports this fact. Van Cleve also completed and copied a number of works of de Crayer. When de Crayer left Brussels for Gent around 1664, van Cleve followed his master and established himself in Gent where he resided for the rest of his life. Saint Nicholas of Tolentino After de Crayer died, van Cleve was commissioned to complete his master de Crayer's unfinished works in various churches and to finish the cartoons for the tapestries ordered by the French king Louis XIV from the Antwerp tapestry workshops. He travelled to France to show his cartoons to the king in person. He remained for three months in Paris. He worked in Gent until his death at the age of 70. Works Jan van Cleve painted altarpieces, allegorical pictures and mythological scenes. He was a prolific painter who was commissioned to produce many religious works for the churches and convents in Flanders and Brabant. His style was close to that of his master de Crayer. His best works are in the convent of the Black Nuns in Gent and the town hall of Gent.

It was directed by Ralph Thomas and stars Leslie Phillips as a doctor who gets accidentally trapped on an outgoing cruise ship while it begins a round the world trip. The cast was rounded out by a number of British comedy actors including James Robertson Justice, Harry Secombe and Angela Scoular. It was based on the story Doctor on Toast by Richard Gordon. Plot Renowned surgeon Sir Lancelot Spratt (James Robertson Justice) arranges a cruise for his patient, the famous television star Basil Beauchamp (Simon Dee). The captain of the ship is Lancelot Spratt's brother George Spratt (Robert Morley). Doctor Burke (Leslie Phillips) becomes a stowaway by mistake when chasing his girlfriend (Angela Scoular) onto the ship to propose to her. She is one of a group of models doing a fashion shoot with camp photographer (Graham Chapman). Other passengers aboard ship include pools winner Llewellyn Wendover (Harry Secombe) and Mrs. Dailey (Irene Handl), a socially ambitious lady hoping to find a wealthy match for her daughter Dawn (Janet Mahoney). Burke is pursued by the Master-at-Arms (Freddie Jones) who correctly suspects that he does not have a ticket. Burke tries various ruses to try to escape him, including dressing up as a doctor. Eventually he is caught and exposed as a stowaway. Captain Spratt orders him to serve as an orderly, scrubbing the ship. When the ship's doctor falls ill from a tropical disease, Burke takes over his duties. He is called into action when a Soviet cargo ship sends a request for help due to a patient with acute appendicitis. Burke is transferred to that ship to perform an operation. By the time he has finished his own ship has departed, and he is forced to stay on board the Soviet vessel until it reaches Grimsby. When the cruise ship finally returns to port, Burke learns his girlfriend has married the ship's doctor, now recovered from his illness. Meanwhile, Dawn Dailey, having failed to snare Captain Spratt, decides to marry Wendover. She learns after the wedding that he is not as wealthy as she had imagined.

The plot of the book focused on Dr Grymsdyke and was different from the final film. The original intention was for James Robertson Justice to play two roles, Sir Lancelot Spratt and his twin Captain George Spratt (a variation of the part of Captain Hogg that he had played in Doctor at Sea) ‚Äì \\"the best part of any we'd done together\\" according to producer Betty Box.Box p 272 Shortly before filming however Justice had a cerebral stroke and was rushed from his home near Inverness to Aberdeen for brain surgery. Justice recovered and wanted to play both roles as planned but the filmmakers knew he would be unable to do so, in part because he now had an uncontrollable tremor in his right arm. The part of Captain Spratt was offered to Robert Morley (who had been considered for the role of Lancelot Spratt in Doctor in the House but had wanted too much money). James Robertson Justice still played the smaller role of Lancelot. \\"It must have taken every ounce of energy he possessed to do it\\", said Box. \\"We knew he needed the money and paid him for both parts ‚Äì he certainly deserved it for long and loyal service.\\"Box p 273 Producer Betty Box said the film \\"wasn't a happy time for\\" her and director Ralph Thomas as they knew it \\"was the last movie we'd be able to make\\" with Justice.Box p 272 She felt Robert Morley's casting undermined the picture. \\"Situations which would have been hilarious with James were just mildly amusing with Morley, and the whole point of the piece was lost\\", she said. Despite good performances from other members of the cast she thought \\"the entire project was doomed... from the day a real life surgeon said the world 'Scalpel' over dear James's unconscious bulk.\\"Box p 273 It was Leslie Phillip's third appearance in a \\"doctor\\" film. He played Dr Tony Burke, the same character he played in Doctor in Love. In Doctor in Clover he played Dr Gaston Grimsdkye. It was the first time Angela Scoular acted opposite Leslie Phillips; the two would later fall in love and marry.Angela Scoular obituary at The Independent Reception Ralph Thomas did not like the film saying \\"the unit was getting desperate, of course, and the title says it all; but it still, fortunately, continued making money, but I couldn't bear to make any more films in the series. And so Rank said \\"Well, right. Would you allow us to dispose of your interest in a television series. And I said \\"yes I've love to\\" and so they did.\\"Collected Interviews: Voices from Twentieth- century Cinema by Wheeler W. Dixon, SIU Press, 2001 p113 Box thought the Doctor series \\"died\\" when James Robertson Justice did.Box p 273 Penelope Mortimer of The Observer wrote \\"why all this talent, of various kinds, gets absolutely nowhere must be the fault of the screenplay... For it is a dreadful story, a terrible script, inadequately seasoned with worn out laughs. In all fairness I must say that a large section of the audience was hooting with laughter. It is on occasionals like this that one feels one has dropped from Mars.\\" The film receives two stars out of five in the Radio Times Guide to Films, which describes it as \\"innocently smutty\\" and feeling like it has been made up of \\"leftovers from Doctor at Sea\\".Radio Times Guide to Films p.382 References *Box, Bett, Lifting the Lid, 2000 External links * Category:1970 films Category:1970 comedy films Category:British comedy films Category:British films Category:Doctor in the House Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Ralph Thomas Category:Medical-themed films Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios Category:Films produced by Betty Box ","title":"Doctor in Trouble"},{"id":"18768286","text":"Gregory Smith (born 21 May 1963)http://www.discogs.com/artist/851526-Greg- Smith-6 is an American bassist and vocalist.

Directed by Ken Annakin, it starred Leslie Phillips and Stanley Baxter and was notable for the feature film debut of Julie Christie. Plot Captain \\"Dandy Forsdyke\\" (Leslie Phillips) is a habitual criminal who can't resist a tempting robbery. His gifts are for pickpocketing and safecracking and even does not use his real name. However, he is engaged to Babette (Julie Christie), a stripper who wants him to go straight before they marry. In love with Babette, he desperately wants to quit, but is always lured back into another crime by his associates. Babette comes across a society known as Crooks Anonymous who help hardened thieves go straight. Founded by Mr Montague (Wilfrid Hyde-White), and funded by a generous legacy, they have an excellent track record. Babette agrees to help them cure Forsdyke. Forsdyke is picked up during a robbery by a Crooks Anonymous man, Brother Widdowes (Stanley Baxter), who is disguised as a policeman, and taken to the Crooks Anonymous headquarters. Confronted by Montague, Forsdyke admits that he wants to give up crime and marry Babette. They begin to interrogate him, and discover that he is a habitual liar, whose real name is Cox, who has never seen military service, despite his claim to be a decorated veteran. Widdowes and Montague embark Forsdyke on a dose of punishment therapy and rehabilitation. They begin by locking him in a room filled with safes, which contain cigarettes, food, drink and a number of booby traps which make opening them a hazardous business. After a week of this torture, Forsdyke is beginning to crack. Nonetheless, he fails a test to see how much progress he has made, reverting to his old ways as soon as he is outside. After a month of correctional therapy and reinforcement training, Forsdyke finally passes the test and is released into society. He moves into a house with Babette, gets a job working as Father Christmas in a department store and refuses an offer by one of his old pals to go back into criminality. However, after consuming large amounts of alcohol at a Christmas party he passes out and finds himself alone in the department store, with ¬£250,000 of takings near him in the safe. Forsdyke breaks in intending to steal the money, and then panicking at his relapse, calls Crooks Anonymous for help. They send their two top men, including Brother Widdowes, who also cave at the sight of the money. They in turn call for the Chairman who arrives with his Secretary. Confronted with this unique opportunity, the five of them decide to steal the money and split it among themselves. They make good their escape, past the drunken night watchmen and head through the streets. They go to Forsdyke's house, only to be confronted by an outraged Babette, who demands they put the money back. Grudgingly they agree, as she threatens to call Scotland Yard and inform them of the burglary. They successfully manage to return the money, unfortunately triggering an alarm which brings the night watchmen out. Just making good their escape, they breathe a sigh of relief. Forsdyke marries Babette and as a sign of appreciation they make her a Sister of Crooks Anonymous for keeping them all honest.

Its name is derived from the Spanish for \\"little beak\\".  Preparation  Typically, the peppers are hand-picked during two harvests between September and December. They are roasted over embers, which gives them a distinct sweet, spicy flavour, more akin to bell peppers than chilli peppers, despite their small size. They are then peeled and again grilled in grill bar for extra flavour and texture then marinated with salt, pepper and olive oil and then de-seeded by hand, before being packed into jars or tins for sale. Piquillo peppers are often stuffed with meat, seafood, or cheese, and served as tapas.  Nutrition  Piquillo peppers are high in fiber, and vitamins C, E, A, and B. In particular, their vitamin C content is very high, comparable to a citrus fruit.

Ardabil has a long and illustrious history of Persian carpet weaving. The reign of the Safavid Dynasty in the 16th and 17th centuries represented the peak of Persian carpet making in the region. The name Ardabil comes from the Avesta (The sacred book of Zoroastrians) and has the literal meaning of a tall holy place. The weavers in Ardabil ply their craft using Azerbaijani knots. Two of the most famous carpets in existence today are a pair of Persian carpets from Ardabil. One of the carpets, measuring 34' x 17', is on display in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, England. Ardabil rugs feature motifs that are very similar to Caucasian rugs, but with more motifs and objects woven into the borders. The colors are also lighter. The patterns are predominantly geometric and the most common layouts on Ardabil rugs are medallions, multiple connected diamond-shaped medallions, and all-over octagonal shapes. The most recognized design found on Ardabil rugs is the famous Mahi (Herati) design - a diamond medallion and small fish throughout. Some modern weavers have begun to favor bold geometric patterns over the traditional Mahi (Herati) design, and have added colors such as turquoise and purple to the more traditional red, pink, ivory, green, and blue. The warp on Ardabil rugs is mostly cotton, while the weft is either cotton or wool, although silk is also used as weft on fine Ardabil rugs. The weavers may also incorporate silk into the woolen pile in order to accentuate highlights in the pattern. Ardabil rugs include some widely known carpets: \\" Ardabil\\", \\"Sheikh Safi\\", \\"Sarabi\\", \\"Shah Abbasi\\" and \\"Mir\\". Sheikh-Safi The Sheikh-Safi or Ardabil Carpets are a pair of carpets presented as a gift to the complex of Sheikh Safi-ad-din in Ardabil in 1539 CE. They are considered by many the finest carpets in the world. For Azerbaijani and Iranian Shiites, the ‚ÄúSheikh Safi‚Äù mausoleum ranked second among the places of pilgrimage (the first being the Imam Reza mausoleum in Mashad). This type of rug is noted for its sophisticated construction, original compositional elements and decorative completeness of the 16-point turunj located in the middle of the center field. The sketch was created by a talented artist, while the carpet itself was woven by artful craftsmen of Tabriz, or perhaps even those from Ardabil. In 1539, the carpet was bought by Kashani pilgrim and presented as a charity gift to the ‚ÄúSheikh Safi‚Äù mosque. However, before handing it over to the mosque, Maghsud Kashanitold the makers to weave his name on the rug along with the following stanza: ‚ÄúI have no other shelter but yours, except for your doors there is no other roof but for this home where I can lay my head‚Äù (The couplet from the 65th gazelle by the 14th century lyric poet hafez (1300‚Äì1389). And beneath it: ‚ÄúThe work by a servant of this home, Maghsud Kashani‚Äù and the figure 946 (1539). This addition is perceived as a patch. The original ‚ÄúSheikh Safi‚Äù, repaired from the other of the pair, is displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, with the second carpet, reduced in size, in Los Angeles. Sarabi These carpets derived their names from the town of Sarab situated between Tabriz and Ardabil, There are the following versions of the Sarabi carpet: The center field covered with the vertical lines, which are decorated by blooming branches arranged one after another in am asymmetrical way. The center field with one gel. The carpets are beautiful and harmonious in color. The vegetal ornamental elements are woven almost in dotted lines, which to some extent resembles Karabakh carpets. Shah Abbasi The name of these carpets is associated with Shah Abbas I (1587‚Äì1629), the fifth ruler of the Safavids empire. Shah Abbas moved the capital of the Safavids to the internal regions of Iran, namely to the town of Isfahan. As a result, many of the prominent craftsmen moved to Isfahan. The ‚ÄúGum-Shah Abbasi‚Äù carpet is noted for the elements of an unusual form named ‚Äú≈ûah Abbasi g√ºll…ôri‚Äù (in Azerbaijani ‚ÄúFlowers of Shakh Abbas‚Äù). They largely consist of fantastical flowers as well as fig leaves. The asymmetrical arrangement of the elements along the horizontal line is viewed as the characteristic feature of this carpet. Mir The name of the carpet, which belongs to the Ardabil group of the Tabriz school, is associated with the names of the villages of Mir and Mirshi to the south of Ardabil. The composition of the center field is formed by butteh ( bush). The forms of these buteh as well as their vertical and horizontal arrangement remind of the carpets of the Shirvan type ‚ÄúMaraza‚Äù and ‚ÄúKhila-buta‚Äù. Yet the individual butteh on the ‚ÄúMir‚Äù carpet have a much simpler composition. This type of butteh can be also found on the fabric manufactured in Tabriz, and Kerman. The border and the center edge of the carpet are unusual: they used to consist of vegetal curve-linear elements but as the weaving technique improved they acquired new forms.

Cutting across the city from South to North, it has been described as the \\"true structuring axis\\" of the city.  History and description  The street was formerly a thalweg partially along which the Arroyo de la Castellana flowed towards its emptying in the Abro√±igal. The Fuente Castellana, which was the main source of the Arroyo de la Castellana and, according to Cervantes, a spring with \\"extremely cold waters\\", was located near the current day plaza de Emilio Castelar. The waterstream, formerly used as dump, was channeled in 1807. The first stretch of the street (from the Gate of Recoletos to the Fuente Castellana) was built following the western (right) bank of the stream; the works started in early 1833, and inaugurated in October 1833, it was named Paseo de las Delicias de la Princesa and Paseo de las Delicias de Isabel II after Princess/Queen Isabella, although it was popularly known as Paseo de la Fuente Castellana. The tree planting ensued for some years. In the 1930s, during the Second Republic, the Minister Indalecio Prieto and Architect Secundino Zuazo gave the necessary boost for the expansion of the street towards the North, linked to the project of Nuevos Ministerios. Following the Civil War, the Francoist regime resumed the works. During the dictatorship, the stretch north of the crossroads with Raimundo Fern√°ndez Villaverde and Joaqu√≠n Costa was named \\"Avenida del General√≠simo\\". In 1980, following the return of democracy, the Madrid City Council voted to rename streets throughout the capital, reinstating those had prior to the Second Republic; these measures, passed with the votes of the PSOE and PCE municipal councillors, were opposed by the UCD councillors. The Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium (Estadium the Chamart√≠n) in the early 1950s La Castellana is prolongation of the Paseo de Recoletos and the Paseo del Prado, and these three avenues vertebrate the north-south axis of the city. The street starts at Plaza de Col√≥n, ending at its junction with the M-30 ring road, the so- called Nudo Norte. It passes through the Plaza de Lima, Plaza de Cuzco and the Plaza de Castilla. The districts of Chamber√≠ (Almagro and R√≠os Rosas neighborhoods), Tetu√°n (Cuatro Caminos, Castillejos and Almenara neighborhoods) and Fuencarral-El Pardo (La Paz neighborhood) lie to the West of La Castellana, while the districts of Salamanca (Recoletos and Castellana neighborhoods) and Chamart√≠n (El Viso, Hispanoam√©rica, Nueva Espa√±a and Castilla neighborhoods) lie to the East. The financial center of Madrid is located along La Castellana or its immediate proximity, comprising locations such as AZCA, Puerta de Europa, and the CTBA. The street also features several embassies and hotels. Other landmarks found along this street include the Palacio de Congresos, the headquarters of the Ministry of Defence, and the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium.

It was first published in the first Indian edition of Plain Tales from the Hills in 1888, and in subsequent editions of that collection. The story is set on an unnamed 'station', or one of the posts where the British lived during the Raj. It is something of a backwater, \\"nearly a day's journey\\" from Lahore; and at the time of the story, \\"just before the final exodus of the Hill-goers\\", i.e. at the beginning of the hot season, there are under 20 British in residence. The story concerns Saumarez, a well-paid member of the Indian Civil Service who is \\"popular with women\\". He decides to propose marriage to one of a pair of sisters, Maud (the elder) and Edith Copleigh, who do everything together: the gossip of the station is that it will be to Maud, which would be an excellent match. She is prettier than her sister, though they are very alike in figure, look and voice. Saumarez arranges a moonlight picnic for six couples to provide a romantic setting. After midnight, the supper is interrupted by a terrible dust storm, and confusion reigns. In a lull in the storm, the narrator (the usual persona of 'Kipling') hears Edith crying \\"O my God!\\". and asking to be taken home. He refuses till daylight, they separate - and then Saumarez says he's proposed to the wrong one. The narrator sees on Maud's face \\"that look on her face which only comes once or twice in a lifetime - when a woman is perfectly happy and the air is full of trumpets and gorgeously- coloured fire, and the Earth turns into cloud because she loves and is loved.\\" It is Saumarez's duty to wipe that look off her face. 'Kipling' leaves him to it, galloping off to tell Edith: \\"You have got to come back with me, Miss Copleigh. Saumarez has something to tell you.\\" They return home in the dawn, Maud riding with 'Kipling': \\"Maud Copleigh did not talk to me at any length.\\" :All quotations in this article have been taken from the Uniform Edition of Plain Tales from the Hills published by Macmillan & Co., Limited in London in 1899.

The story, which is set in Simla, the Hill Station where the British used to spend their leaves during the hot weather, tells of Miss Gaurey, whom \\"her parents made ... marry Colonel Schreiderling ... not much more than 35 years her senior\\", who is a good match, if not particularly well off, and has lung-complaints which she nurses \\"seventeen days in each month\\".

The airport is also the venue for the annual GTR Challenge and Drag Battle motorsport event. History With the implementation of an airmail service between Australia and Britain, owing to its location on the Main Southern railway line midway between Sydney and Melbourne and proximity to Canberra, Cootamundra was chosen as the southern terminus. The airfield became the initial base for Butler Air Transport, established as an airmail contractor in 1934 to operate a section of the route between Cootamundra and Charleville, providing connection to Qantas services between Brisbane and Darwin. The company relocated its base to Sydney in 1938 following the withdrawal of the airmail contract. RAAF Station Cootamundra Cootamundra was chosen as a station for No. 1 Air Observers School and No. 2 Recruit Depot during World War II. Numbers 60 and 73 Squadrons also operated from the base. Following the cessation of hostilities the airfield reverted to civilian use. Accidents and incidents * On 25 June 2001, an Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante operated by Airtex Aviation on a charter flight from Sydney to Griffith suffered an engine fire en route. Believing the fire to be extinguished after taking initial action, the pilot elected to land at Young Airport. On finding Young under fog, the pilot diverted to Cootamundra. Between the towns, the aircraft cabin filled with smoke from the fire which had flared up again in the engine nacelle. During the emergency landing, only the aircraft's right main landing gear extended and the aircraft skidded to a stop on grass next to the runway. The pilot and all 8 passengers evacuated safely, however the investigation revealed delays in the emergency response to the accident, including an Ambulance that was initially unable to access the airfield as the emergency gate was locked.

In the 1950s he founded and managed the Armenian Information Service, which made a number of publications. His expos√© writing has been the subject of lawsuits. Sanctuary v.

Derounian is also notable for editing the manifesto of Armenia's first Prime Minister, Hovhannes Kajaznuni.* (Book cover), Full text online  Personal life  He was born to Boghos Derounian and Eliza Aprahamian in Dedeagach, Adrianople Vilayet, Ottoman Empire (today Alexandroupoli, Greece). The Balkan Wars and First World War had an unsettling effect on the entire region, and his hometown repeatedly changed hands. The family moved several times, spending time in Turkey and Sofia, Bulgaria, where his brother Steven Derounian (who later became a Republican Representative) was born. Eventually the family emigrated to the United States, settling in Mineola, New York. He went on to study at New York University's School of Journalism. Later, he married Marie Nazarian and had a daughter named Elyse and a son named Robert. He died of a heart attack on April 23, 1991, while researching at the library of the American Jewish Committee on East 56th Street.  Undercover work  In 1933, Archbishop Leon Tourian was assassinated at the altar of his New York church. The assassins were members of the Dashnaks, a radical Armenian group who accused the Archbishop of treason to the Armenian national cause. Deeply shocked, Derounian spent the rest of his life opposing the Dashnaks as well as other violent radicals - in particular, fighting fascism and all forms of racism. During the 1948 Israeli-Arab War, Derounian also infiltrated among the Arabs fighting the newborn Israel, travelling extensively in the Arab parts of the expiring Mandatory Palestine as well as in Egypt and Syria. His position on the Israeli-Arab Conflict, at the conclusion of his book \\"Cairo to Damascus\\", was that \\"In the simplest of terms, Israel, as I saw it, represented Good; the Arab world represented Evil\\".\\"Cairo to Damascus\\" Ch. 24 \\"The Plotters\\" \\"Under Cover\\" \\"Under Cover: My Four Years in the Nazi Underworld of America - The Amazing Revelation of How Axis Agents and Our Enemies Within Are Now Plotting To Destroy the United States\\" became a best seller when published in 1943. Derounian was a tireless investigator of subversive activity, and infiltrated numerous \\"patriotic\\" groups, some of which he listed in the opening of his book Under Cover: German American Bund, Christian Front, American Nationalist Party, American Women Against Communism, The Gray Shirts, America First Committee, Christian Mobilizers, The American Defense Society, Anglo-Saxon Federation of America, National Workers League, Yankee Freemen, Flanders Hall, American Patriots among many others. Among the groups he also helped expose was the international Nazi propaganda news agency World-Service. He was also the chief investigator of the anti-fascist organization, Friends of Democracy. In a speech Representative Arthur G. Klein attempted to give in the US House in 1944 and which was printed in The Nation, Klein praises Derounian's book Under Cover: =Lawsuits related to Under Cover = This expose made him enemies, and several parties instituted actions against him for alleged libelous material. Three of the four cases failed the consolidated case before the jury, leaving a verdict in favor only of lawyer Jeremiah Stokes, which was later overturned. The lawsuit claimed that Derounian had held Stokes up for ridicule. Stokes is first mentioned on page 365 of Under Cover, and his patriotism questioned in the next chapter, which begins: > I was in the room alone with two men. The one who had pumped both my hands > in welcome was a small round man with a bald dome and rotund face. He had > small, beady eyes and he peered at you from behind rimmed glasses. He was > definitely of the single-track, uncompromising zealot type. Jeremiah Stokes > had let his law practice slide and was devoting the major portion of his > time to the writing of \\"patriotic\\" tracts. Derounian appealed; the appellate court reversed the district court and remanded the matter, stating in the overview:Derounian v. Stokes, No. 3526, UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS, TENTH CIRCUIT, 168 F.2d 305; 1948 U.S. App. LEXIS 3253, May 11, 1948. > The court found error in the submission to the jury of a physical > description of the individual as small and rotund in stature, bald, round of > face, and having small and beady eyes.

He decided to travel to Palestine in 1947 via England and Egypt, to chronicle the war. Traveling with his camera, he documented what he saw and the material for this adventure became his book Cairo to Damascus, published in 1951. During his investigation, Carlson covered, not just the original subject, but many other aspects of the war. Throughout the war, Carlson didn't travel with the Western journalists. He traveled with Arabs, posing as an anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi, pro- Arab sympathizer in order to win their confidences. In general, everywhere he visited in the Arab world, Carlson presented extreme anti-Jewish views, whereby he could hear from his conversation partners, be it Arab civilians and military men, Nazi-German mercenaries or the Grand Mufti's Bosnian volunteers, their extreme views and their aspiration to put an end to Jewish existence in Palestine. He travelled between the two sides, crossing the hot zone in the midst of armed conflict, while in the Jewish side of Jerusalem, he identified himself with his true identity, as the writer of Under Cover. In January 1948, Carlson arrived in London, where he presented himself as Charles L. Morey, \\"sales manager of the Homestead Farm Appliance Corporation, with offices and plant in St. John, Indiana\\" - an identity he had used already in 1945, in his correspondence with \\"every British hate-monger and anti-democrat\\" he read or heard about.John Roy Carlson, Cairo to Damascus, pp. 19‚Äì20. In London he met with British Fascists who supported Oswald Mosley as well as mercenaries that were about to join the Arabs and fight alongside with them. Carlson left London and reached Cairo on March 2, 1948. When he tried to take photographs in the city, he was detained by the police under the suspicion of being a Jewish spy. On their way to the police station, Carlson and the two policemen were followed by a crowd yelling \\"Jew!\\". When Carlson turned around and shouted \\"I am an American!\\", he was yelled back: \\"Then you are worse than a Jew!\\".John Roy Carlson, Cairo to Damascus, pp. 48‚Äì49. In Cairo he met with members of the Muslim Brotherhood and got them to talk about their hatred towards Jews. On April 1, 1948, Carlson left Cairo accompanying the Egyptian \\"Green Shirts\\" volunteers as a photographer. They entered Palestine through Rafah. Not far from Be'er Sheba, Carlson saw for the first time a Jewish communal settlement ‚Äì Kibbutz Beit Eshel - \\"contrasted sharply with the squalor of Arab villages\\".John Roy Carlson, Cairo to Damascus, p. 164. Through Hebron, the men reached Jerusalem. Carlson accompanied the Arab fighters, moving between different points of conflict. On April 13, 1948, the Hadassah medical convoy massacre took place, after which Carlson says the Arabs claimed \\"they had been falsely informed of large concentrations of Jewish bands gathering near the Hospital and University.\\" When asked who had informed them, the Arabs of Aboutor answered: \\"The English!\\".John Roy Carlson, Cairo to Damascus, p. 182. Carlson went with his friends back to Egypt in order to purchase more weapons. On their way they passed very near Kfar Etzion, where he witnessed a battle between the Arab Legion and the Jewish Kibbutz.John Roy Carlson, Cairo to Damascus, p. 185. On their way back from Egypt to Palestine, the volunteer fighters' truck drove near the ruins of Kibbutz Kfar Darom, towards Gaza City. On the beach, a member of the city council said to Carlson: \\"See that water? One month from now it will be black as far as the horizon with the nude bodies of floating Jews.\\"John Roy Carlson, Cairo to Damascus, p. 209. Carlson and his friends proceeded to Jerusalem, during a wave of Arab defeats all over the country. In his book, Carlson is referring to the Arab exodus that followed those defeats: \\"This flight-psychosis, which prevailed among the Arabs ... is a difficult phenomenon to explain. It was a mass hysteria induced by poor morale and by fear of revenge and retribution for the Arab massacres and lootings from 1920 on.\\"John Roy Carlson, Cairo to Damascus, p. 234. Carlson claims the Arab Legion was seen in Gaza, Hebron and Jerusalem, while the British formally stated that \\"all units of the Arab Legion had left Palestine for Trans-Jordan prior to the end of the Mandate\\". On the night of the May 14 - the night before the Israeli declaration of independence, Carlson saw Gush Etzion burning down. His good friend Moustafa told him that night: \\"Every Arab knows that we will be in Tel Aviv one month from tomorrow. We will sit in the cafes by the sea, drink coffee...eat baklawa and enjoy the Jewish girls!\\"John Roy Carlson, Cairo to Damascus, pp. 239‚Äì240. Carlson decided to cross to the Jewish part of Jerusalem, so he could \\"be with the Jews on the first day of the new Jewish State\\". Holding a small American flag he crossed just in time to cover the departure of Alan Cunningham, the High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan.John Roy Carlson, Cairo to Damascus, pp. 245‚Äì246. He experienced the siege of the Jewish part of Jerusalem from within, and depicted the inhabitants' hardships, shortage, hunger, continuous bombardment and grief over the dead. Carlson went back and forth between the Jewish and the Arab sides.

Life Statue of Jean-Baptiste Girard (detail) at Fribourg. He was the fifth child in a family of fourteen, and his gift for teaching was early shown at home in helping his mother with the younger children. At sixteen he entered the novitiate of the Franciscans at Lucerne; after spending some time teaching in the colleges of the order, he went to W√ºrzburg for his philosophical and theological studies, and was there ordained to the priesthood. Returning to Fribourg in 1789, he spent ten years in missionary work and in teaching philosophy to the young men of his order. Upon the invitation of Stapfer, minister of arts and sciences, in 1798 he published an essay outlining a scheme of national Swiss education. His orthodoxy came under some suspicion, caused by his admiration for Kantian ideas, which was evident in his essay. Girard was called to Verne where he remained four years. In 1804 he was recalled to Fribourg, and took up work in the primary schools. As director of the schools in Fribourg (1807‚Äì1823), Girard made education compulsory, organized the school administration, insisted on the adoption of good textbooks and methods, and introduced the monitorial system, avoiding the abuse of mere memory exercise and making every study converge to the child's complete education. In 1809 Girard was sent to Yverdon-les-Bains to make a report to the Government on Pestalozzi's institution. He had met the latter in Bern and professed admiration for his ability as an educator, while differing from him on several important points, especially on the value of the monitorial system. Girard's successful reforms at Fribourg were the occasion for bitter opposition. Girard's application of the monitorial system was opposed by the bishop and the civil authorities of Fribourg in 1823. Jesuit hostility resulted in him being driven away from his position, and he then went to work in the gymnasium at Lucerne as professor of philosophy. In 1834 he returned to Fribourg, where he remained till his death, engaged in educational pursuits and in the publication of some of his works. Reputation Girard had a great reputation in France, being a Knight of the Legion of Honour, and a corresponding member of the Acad√©mie des Sciences morales et politiques. In Switzerland, he was hailed as a second Pestalozzi. He had a genius for teaching, his method of stimulating the intelligence of the children at Fribourg and interesting them actively in learning, and not merely cramming them with rules and facts, being warmly praised by the Swiss educationalist Fran√ßois Naville (1784‚Äì1846) in his treatise on public education (1832). Girard's undogmatic method and his Liberal Christianity brought him into conflict with the Jesuits, but his aim was, in all his teaching, to introduce the moral idea into the minds of his pupils by familiarizing them with the right or wrong working of the facts he brought to their attention, and thus to elevate character all through the educational curriculum. Works Besides many reports and memoirs, his principal writings are: * (1829‚Äì31) * (1834, 9th ed. 1894; Eng. trans. by Lord Ebrington, The Mother Tongue, 1847) * (1835) * (1840) * (Paris, 1840‚Äì48) These works banish abstractions that are above the child's understanding, principles and rules being taught chiefly by means of concrete examples, and difficulties being introduced gradually.

J. Raffles stories by E. W. Hornung. The stories were adapted by Philip Mackie. Set in Victorian era London, the series features the criminal adventures of gentleman thief A. J. Raffles, a renowned cricketer, and his friend, the eager but naive Bunny Manders, as they test their skills in relieving the wealthy of their valuables whilst avoiding detection, especially from Inspector Mackenzie. The episodes were largely faithful adaptations of the stories in the books, though occasionally two stories would be merged to create one episode, such as \\"The Gold Cup\\", which featured elements from two short stories, \\"A Jubilee Present\\" and \\"The Criminologist's Club\\". The series has been released on DVD. Regular cast *Anthony Valentine as A. J.

The executive producer of the series was David Cunliffe and the theme music was by Anthony Isaac. The production company was Yorkshire Television. Screenwriter Philip Mackie adapted the episodes from the A. J. Raffles stories of author E. W. Hornung. The Albany refused to give Yorkshire Television permission to film on their grounds, so the production team instead built their own exterior. The television series took six months to film and was shot on a mixture of video and film. Some episodes were released on VHS. The series was later released on DVD. Episodes { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"background: #FFFFFF;\\" style=\\"width:98%;\\" - ! width=\\"15%\\"Episode # !! Title !! Original airdate } Reception In his book Raffles and His Creator, Peter Rowland praised the television series for its fidelity to Hornung's stories, stating that the adapter Philip Mackie kept as close as he could to the spirit and dialogue of the original stories. Rowland noted that, while the series simplified the Raffles saga by keeping A. J. Raffles a well-known cricketer living at the Albany (unlike in the original stories, in which Raffles's situation changes in the short story \\"The Gift of the Emperor\\"), the basic characters of Raffles and Bunny were brought more accurately to life than in any previous adaptation. Rowland also stated that Raffles had previously been portrayed with non-canonical features (for example, both David Niven and Ronald Colman portrayed Raffles with a moustache). Compared to previous actors, Anthony Valentine portrayed Raffles with an appearance closer to the slim, dark-haired, clean-shaven description of the original character, with Bunny Manders (Christopher Strauli) being fair-haired and appearing a few years younger than Raffles, as in the stories. According to Rowland, the series was positively received by viewers and critics. David Pryce-Jones wrote in The Listener (3 March 1977): \\"Raffles has become a serial. In Anthony Valentine, what is more, Raffles has been splendidly personified, a lean, dark figure with a smile at once engaging and slightly saturnine. The eye is cold, the manner debonair. He looks as if he could well play cricket for England and would steal any tiara without compunction.\\" The series was nominated in 1978 for the BAFTA TV Awards for Best Costume Design (Brian Castle), Make-up (Phillippa Haigh), and VTR Editor (the Yorkshire TV Team).

History  The Christianization of the Davao area in Mindanao is attributed to the arrival in the area of the Augustinian Missionaries in 1848. This was followed by the Jesuits and the P.M.E Fathers of Quebec. But it was the Maryknoll Fathers who finally arrived in the area in 1958 and settled down to the arduous task of evangelizing the inhabitants. Early Spanish exploration of the Davao area can be traced back to 1528 when Saavedra visited the Sarangani Islands on the southwestern entrance to the Davao Gulf. He coasted along the shores of Davao Oriental where he established the first settlement, that of Caraga. The early missionaries later settled in places like Caraga, Baganga, Cateel and the nearby areas, baptizing, giving the sacraments, building churches and convents. Some of these old structures can still be found today, and some of them are still serving their Christian communities. The entire Davao Province was politically subdivided into three in 1967. From this subdivision emerged the provinces of Davao del Norte with Tagum as its capital, Davao del Sur with Digos as capital, and Davao Oriental with Mati as capital. Ecclesiastically, the entire Mindanao area was under the Diocese of Cebu since 1595, until some parts were placed under the jurisdiction of Jaro in 1865. In 1910 the Diocese of Zamboanga was created and took all ecclesiastical territories in Mindanao away from Cebu. Other dioceses were established over the years, including the then Prelature of Davao which eventually became a diocese. In 1962 the Prelature of Tagum was created, taking its territory mostly from the then Prelature of Davao. On February 16, 1984, Pope John Paul II created the new Diocese of Mati, taking part of its territory from that of the Diocese of Tagum. In November of the same year, the Most Rev. Patricio Alo, until then the Auxiliary Bishop of Davao, was appointed as the first Bishop of Mati. Meanwhile, the Diocese of Davao had become an archdiocese, and Tagum and Mati were made its suffragans. The diocese has experienced no jurisdictional changes, and is currently a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Davao. The first bishop was Most Rev. Patricio Hacbang Alo, DD. He was born on December 2, 1939, in Cebu City. He was ordained a priest on March 14, 1964 of the Archdiocese of Cebu and was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Davao on April 14, 1981. His episcopal ordination was on June 7, 1981. Pope John Paul II appointed him as the first bishop of the Diocese of Mati on November 9, 1984 and has resigned on October 19, 2014 serving for almost 30 years. For more than 3 years, the diocese was sede vacante until Pope Francis has appointed Most Rev. Abel C. Apigo, DD as its new bishop on February 10, 2018.

Flatkaka is soft, round, thin and dark with a characteristic pattern from the pan. Traditionally, flatkaka was baked on hot stones or straight on the embers of the fire, later on small but heavy cast iron frying pans, and today, when making flatkaka at home, people sometimes bake them directly on an electric hot plate to get the desired result. There usually is a difference between home-made flatkaka and the varieties sold in stores, the latter being somewhat thicker and dryer because of added wheat flour. It is assumed that the Icelandic tradition of baking flatbread goes back to the settlement of Iceland in the 9th century. Historically, Iceland moss (Cetraria islandica) was sometimes used as a supplement because of a lack of grain on the island. Flatkaka is usually served cut into halves or quarters, with a topping of butter or mutton p√¢t√©, with hangikj√∂t, smoked salmon or even pickled herring.

Its cathedral is in Kidapawan, Cotabato. History The origin of the Diocese of Kidapawan goes back to the first Jesuit missionaries who introduced Christianity to Mindanao in the late 17th century. The Prelature of Kidapawan was erected on June 12, 1976. Bishop Federico O. Escaler, SJ, was elected first prelate ordinary and took over the prelature on Sept. 6, 1976. In 1980, Bishop Orlando B. Quevedo, OMI, was elected bishop-prelate, and ordained on Oct. 28, 1980 at the Cathedral of Kidapawan, North Cotabato. On Nov. 15, 1982 the Prelature of Kidapawan was elevated to a diocese. Bishop Juan de Dios Pueblos was appointed diocesan bishop on Feb. 3, 1987. Mindanao conflict Mindanao was generally peaceful at the time the first settlers from Visayas and Luzon arrived. Natives and Muslims were friendly to the settlers then. Forests, rivers and wild animals were as yet undisturbed. When the logging companies and the settlers later cleared many areas to open up the rice lands, a few rich settlers began the rubber plantations around Kidapawan. Then land grabbing became a big issue. In the early 1970s, the Muslim-Christian conflict erupted. This was branded a religious conflict when in fact it was not. It was actually caused by incidents connected to land- grabbing and to unscrupulous politicians organizing armed groups. Many atrocities were committed and many communities destroyed. When martial law was declared in 1972, the National Democratic Front - NPA again made Mindanao a land of conflict. It was against the background of conflict that the Prelature of Kidapawan was born. This was the term of Bishop Federico Escaler, and he lost no time in convening the First Prelature General Assembly of Kidapawan in 1977. This assembly articulated the prelature's thrust then as Education for Justice. In 1980, Bishop Escaler was transferred to Ipil and Bishop Orlando Quevedo took over the prelature. This was a period of intense growth of the basic ecclesial communities (BECs) with an orientation for justice. Most lay leaders became targets and some were killed. Included in this carnage was Father Tullio Favali, PIME. Every year Favali's death anniversary is celebrated as a Day of the Martyrs in the diocese. Diocesan ministry The Formation Programs of the diocese cover the areas of Christian formation, lay leadership, family life, youth, vocational school ministry, and mass media. Service programs focus on tribal Filipinos, justice and peace, community-based health programs and social action. The Social Action Center of the Diocese of Kidapawan has been institutionalized under the name of GKK-Kidapawan Foundation, Inc. It is the vision of the foundation to contribute to the total development of the people in the diocese, so that they may respond to the people's socio-economic needs, based on limited resources. People's cooperatives are now being established, skills and capabilities developed. Missionary efforts In 1992, during the Fourth General Assembly of the Diocese of Kidapawan, the following diocesan goals and thrusts have been approved by the participants: The building and strengthening of BEC's in the diocese; *The increase of Christian involvement in social action; *The improvement of witnessing and living out of the faith; *The deepening of education; *Support of the liberating initiatives of the indigenous people; *The protection of the richness of nature; *Support for women's organizations in the diocese; *The support of lay organizations to serve the BEC's; *The strengthening of the organization of the youth; and *The strengthening of the campaign for native religious vocations.

Of this total, around 70% exported and the rest were consumed domestically. Of the exports, 25% are Coffea arabica and the balance is Coffea canephora. The specialty coffee market is the best opportunity for growth in Indonesia's coffee industry. In the U.S., specialty coffee has increased its market share from 1% to 20% in the last 25 years.Lingle, T: The State of the Specialty Coffee Industry, Tea and Coffee Trade Journal, July, 2007 Retrieved 2008-08-08 Also, because of the uniqueness of the taste of Indonesian Robusta (Coffea Canephora), popularity of Indonesian Fine Robusta is rising among coffee aficionados.

Members are encouraged to participate in regular trainings (collaborates with international institutions), events (global ad domestic) and initiatives. 2017 marks the beginning of \\"Coffee for Earth\\" initiatives, whereby indigenous people around forest area are trained to plant coffee without damaging the environment. This is a collaboration of SCAI with government institutions (agriculture, forestry, land management, rural developments), research agencies and private sectors. Arabica coffee from Indonesia has been an integral part of many coffee blends for hundreds of years. Mocha Java, which is a blend of Yemeni and Indonesian coffee, was developed in the 18th century. However, unscrupulous dealers are blending Indonesian coffee with lower priced coffee from other origins, confusing the marketplace. SCAI is part of the joint effort to end this practice by supporting the creation of geographical indications for Indonesia‚Äôs Arabica coffee origins with other institutions. As of 2020 there are more than 30 Geographical Indication of Indonesian Coffee, additional areas will follow soon. Efforts to create Digital Teaceability are also underway. Combined with Blockchain technology, this will improve transparency and give more assurance to consumer of Kopi Indonesia. SCAI is also working with institutions from other countries to improve the quality of Indonesia‚Äôs specialty coffee. In July, 2008, SCAI hosted the Director of the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI), who provided training on quality certification of coffee.

Erected in 1968, the diocese was erected from the Archdiocese of Palo. At present, the diocese has experienced no jurisdictional changes, and is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Cebu. The current bishop is Most Reverend Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, appointed in 1998. The diocese comprises the entire province of Southern Leyte, and the towns of Matalom, Bato, Hilongos, Hindang, Inopacan and Baybay in the province of Leyte, with the Maasin Parish Cathedral as the seat of the diocese. Distributed within its 2,505 square kilometers of land are 42 parishes, 1 quasi-parish and one chaplaincy. To facilitate administration these parishes have been grouped under seven vicariates. History The province of Southern Leyte is located in the southeastern portion of the island of Leyte. And the small island of Limasawa off its southern coast is historically significant as the place where Magellan landed, after having sailed from the island of Homonhon in Samar, to celebrate the first Catholic Mass in the Philippines. The chieftain of Limasawa, Kolambu and his men, with Magellan and his men, attended that first Mass celebrated by Father Pedro Valderrama. Until 1960, the island of Limasawa belonged to the island province of Leyte. From 1595 to 1910, the area which now comprises the Diocese of Maasin belonged to the diocese of Cebu. From 1910 to 1937 it belonged to the Diocese of Calbayog. From 1937 to 1968, it came under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Palo in Leyte. On August 14, 1968, the Diocese of Maasin was canonically erected through an apostolic constitution with the incipit Dei Filium adorandum issued March 23, 1968 by Pope Paul VI.Pope Paul VI, Apostolic Constitution creating the Diocese of Maasin Dei Filium adorandum (23 March 1968), Acta Apostolicae Sedis 61 (1969), pp. 5-7.

Congregationum (1968), Acta Apostolicae Sedis 60 (1968), 762. S. Congregatio Consistorialis - Provisio Ecclesiarum He was consecrated on August 8, 1968, and installed as the First Bishop of Maasin on August 14 at Our Lady of Assumption Parish Church in Maasin, the capital of Southern Leyte. Today it is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Cebu. The population of Southern Leyte is made up mostly of Cebuano-speaking people because of its closeness, geographically, to Cebu and Bohol. This population has now reached a total of 558,804, of which 90 per cent are Catholics. In recent years, awareness of their potent role in the local church has been perceived among the lay faithful ‚Äì a result of diocesan programs designed to awaken the \\"sleeping giant\\" in the church. There has been a marked increase in the number of lay ministers to assist priests in every parish, as there has been in the number of volunteer catechists. The Diocese of Maasin today has started to focus on the vision of the Second Plenary Council of the Philippines. Apart from the usual ministerial and sacramental functions, the clergy has succeeded to penetrate the people's conscience with concern for other issues, such as reforestation, among others. The Social Action Center has generously offered help in livelihood projects to those who do not have the necessary capital. This has been successful in the abaca business enterprise. The Center is now in the process of opening up more opportunities for more livelihood projects. The Commission on Youth is helping in the formation of the youth in all the parishes of the diocese through youth encounters and leadership training. It has organized nine diocesan summer youth camps between 1993 and 2015, attended by more than a thousand delegates. In 1993 the Diocese of Maasin marked its 25th anniversary as a diocese. The theme of the celebration set the direction which the diocese will follow in the next decade: \\"RENEWAL: the challenge of the faithful in the Diocese of Maasin.\\" Thus the vision that was planted and took root when Father Pedro Valderrama celebrated the first Mass in the Philippines on March 21, 1521, has borne new fruit. Aside from the prospects of renewal for the entire diocese, the Chaplaincy of Limasawa was raised to that of a parish ‚Äì the Holy Cross and First Mass of Limasawa Parish, on March 29, 1994, more than four centuries later.

The gene encoding HYLS1 is responsible for proper cilial development within the human body. Cilia are microscopic projections that allow sensory input and signalling output within cells, as well as cell motility. Dysfunction results in a range of abnormalities that are often the result of improper cell signalling. A variant form, HLS2, with additional mutations to the KIF7 gene, is less common. KIF7 also ensures correct cilia formation and function, specifically cilia stability and length. Hydrolethalus syndrome (HLS) was first mistakenly identified in Finland, during a study on Meckel syndrome. Like HLS, Meckel syndrome presents with severe physiological abnormalities, namely disruptions to the central nervous system and the presence of extra fingers or toes (polydactyly). HLS can be distinguished from Meckel syndrome by analysing kidney function, which is dysfunctional in Meckel syndrome as a result of cyst formation.  Signs and symptoms  HLS presents itself as various, lethal developmental abnormalities, which often result in either premature stillbirth or death shortly after birth. Rare cases of children born with HLS surviving for several months have been noted. A characteristic abnormality of HLS is an absence of brain tissue and midline structures, with the presence of excess brain fluid (hydrocephalus) as a result of abnormal development of the central nervous system. Other common defects include incomplete lung development, heart defects, a cleft lip or palate, polydactyly, and an abnormally small jaw. Stillbirth and an excess of amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) are common during pregnancy with a HLS- affected foetus, with cases of up to 8 litres cited compared to the normal 1 litre. Less common symptoms such as abnormally small eyes and a broad nose are also possible. Cause=Genetic HLS is caused by a genetic missense mutation of the HYLS1 gene, encoding for Hydrolethalus syndrome protein 1, on chromosome 11; a single base change to the amino acid sequence for HYLS1 in exon 6 involves the replacement of aspartic acid 211 with glycine (D211G) in the polypeptide chain. Exon 6 is the only protein coding exon in HYLS1; proper functioning of exons 1-5 ensures regulation and expression of the entire protein. HLS is an autosomal recessive syndrome; development is only possible if both parents carry the defective gene, and in that instance, the risk of the foetus developing the syndrome is 25%. HLS is a member of the Finnish disease heritage, with incidences more common in Finland than the rest of the world; roughly 1 in 20,000 developing foetuses are affected in Finland. Rare cases in other regions have also been documented, often with less severe phenotypes as a result of allele variability across countries, allowing survival of affected offspring for up to several months. Individuals of Finnish descent are advised to undergo genetic testing before attempting to conceive. Prior to the discovery of HLS, the HYLS1 gene was unknown, and similar genes within humans have not been identified. Orthologs, genes in other species with common ancestral heritage, have been examined to explain the pathophysiology of HLS; a similar gene within the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, is responsible for the formation of cilia. Current hypotheses place a dysfunction of cilia as the main cause of HLS defects arising from the HYLS1 mutation in humans. Differences between wild type and mutant HYLS1 have been clearly observed; the wild type form is localised to the cytoplasm, while the mutant form is localised to the nucleus and forms small clusters, suggesting that the mutant gene disrupts cellular localisation. The protein encoded by the HYLS1 mutant form is unable to carry out essential targeting of centrioles to the plasma membrane, disrupting ciliary function, which results in ciliopathy. As cilia are located in almost all cells throughout the body, cilial dysfunction causes developmental defects in a range of organs and thus the phenotype of HLS can vary greatly, though brain malformation and polydactyly are most commonly observed. Environmental Currently, no environmental factors are known to increase the likelihood of HLS development or progression; HLS is caused only by genetic abnormalities. Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of HLS is abnormal cilia development arising from the inability of the mutated HYLS1 gene to correctly target centrioles to the plasma membrane. Specifically, transition fibres within the transition zone, at the base of the axoneme and adjoining to the plasma membrane, lack proper development. As these structures form the cilial gate, improper development results in a loss of selectivity for protein entry into the ciliary compartment. Variations and related pathologies Mutations in KIF7 have also been noted in patients that present a similar phenotype to HLS and the characteristic HYLS1 A to G transformation; homozygous deletion of the KIF7 gene causes a variant form of HLS, HLS2. KIF7 encodes a structural factor vital to cilial transport, and is also implicated in other developmental disorders, such as Joubert syndrome (JS). Additionally, mutations in HYLS1 are no longer explicitly connected to HLS in humans. Homozygous mutations removing the stop codon in exon 4 of HYLS1 result in a different genomic sequence disruption to the missense mutation of HLS, and phenotypically present as JS. The ‚Äòmolar tooth sign‚Äô of the brain, an anomaly in which cerebellar volume is reduced but cerebellar shape is retained, resembles the molar tooth and is used to identify JS. JS presents with mutations in more than 30 genes, whilst the HYLS1 mutation is the sole cause of HLS, but is also present in the HLS2 variant form with the mutated KIF7 gene. Diagnosis HLS can be readily diagnosed during pregnancy through the use of ultrasound, which will often reveal hydrocephaly and an abnormal structure of the brain. Precise examination via ultrasound or at birth is necessary to rule out Meckel syndrome, Trisomy 13, or Smith‚ÄìLemli‚ÄìOpitz syndrome, which present with similar physiological defects. HLS can be detected at the end of the first trimester, approximately 13 weeks gestation. Treatment No cure or treatment option for individuals with HLS currently exist. Due to the severity of the foetal defects and the poor prognosis for those with HLS, the pregnancy is often terminated. Certain prevention can only be achieved by avoiding conception if genetic testing indicates both prospective parents as carriers of the defective HYLS1 gene.

Life Benkert was born at Nordheim, near the mountain district of Rh√∂n, Germany. After finishing his studies at the gymnasium in M√ºnnerstadt he studied theology at W√ºrzburg and was ordained priest in 1816. He was first a curate at Gaurettersheim and in 1821, was made vice-principal of the theological seminary at W√ºrzburg. While holding these positions Benkert continued his studies. In 1823 he received a doctorate, having offered the dissertation: \\"De Duplici Miss√¢ Catechumenorum et Fidelium\\". From 1823 to 1838 he had the position of principal and in 1838 he was made a cathedral canon and cathedral dean. He opposed the contemporary Josephinism, and sought to reawaken in the younger clergy an interest in the old theological schools. In 1822 he founded a periodical, to increase the influence of his efforts and also to win over the older ecclesiastics. A self- righteous campaigner, he made many enemies, especially among the older clergy. He therefore severed his connection with his periodicals in 1840, and devoted himself to the study of the history of his native district. He died at Coburg. Works The periodical \\"Der Religionsfreund f√ºr Katholiken mit Beitr√§gen religi√∂s gesinnter Manner\\" appeared in six volumes, 1822-26. It attracted much attention and was copied in France in the \\"Ami de la Religion\\". In connection with G. J. Saffenrevter he issued, 1828‚Äì40, a continuation of this, his first, periodical, entitled: \\"Allgemeiner Religions- und Kirchenfreund und Kirchenkorrespondent, eine theologische und kirchenhistorische Zeitschrift\\". At the same time he published, 1828‚Äì34, a periodical entitled \\"Athanasia, eine theologische Zeitschrift, besonders f√ºr die gesamte Pastoral, f√ºr Kirchengeschichte, auch f√ºr P√§dagogik\\".

William Graily Hewit or Graily Hewitt (1864‚Äì1952) was a British novelist and calligrapher, second only to Edward Johnston in importance to the revival of calligraphy in the country at the turn of the twentieth century. Hewitt was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge. First training as a lawyer, he interrupted his career to write a novel and a volume of short stories. He later attended Edward Johnston's evening classes at the Central School of Arts and Crafts and quickly became a teacher there, and at the Camberwell School of Art, taking up Johnston's previous work. Hewitt remained at the Central School until the 1920s and 1930s, publishing together with Johnston throughout the early part of the century and working with a series of other illuminators over the decades. Hewitt was central to the revival of gilding in calligraphy, and his prolific output on type design also appeared between 1915 and 1943 . His contributions to Writing, illuminating and LetteringJohnston, Edward \\"Writing & illuminating, & lettering\\", 8th Edition and his guide Lettering for Students & Craftsmen (1930) are considered particularly crucial to the revival of gilding. He is attributed with the revival of gilding with gesso and gold leaf on vellum. Elements of Hewitt's work are included in a variety of manuscript books. He was one of the initiators of the Society of Scribes and Illuminators, in 1921. Hewitt sought to link calligraphy and type design, arguing that type should represent creations of pen. The Treyford Type, employed for The Pen and Type Design, was a design of Hewitt's. He also created a series of initials for St. John Hornby's Ashendene Press, during the long period 1902 to 1935. He continued calligraphy up to his death on 22 December 1952 aged 88. His work is kept in the Victoria and Albert Museum's collection.

(Official English translation ) Grammatical gender in the Bible The first words of the Old Testament are B'reshit bara Elohim‚Äî\\"In the beginning God created.\\"Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia, (Stuttgart: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 1990), p. 1. The verb bara (created) agrees with a masculine singular subject. Elohim is used to refer to both genders and is plural; it has been used to refer to both Goddess (in 1 Kings 11:33), and God (1 Kings 11:31;https://sites.google.com/site/yahwehelohiym/yahweh/yahweh-the- elohim-of-israel). The masculine gender in Hebrew can be used for objects with no inherent gender, as well as objects with masculine natural gender, and so it is widely used, attributing the masculine gender to most things. However, the noun used for the Spirit of God in Genesis‚Äî\\"Ruach\\"‚Äîis distinctly feminine, as is the verb used to describe the Spirit's activity during creation‚Äî\\"rachaph\\"‚Äîtranslated as \\"fluttereth\\". This verb is used only one other place in the Bible (Deuteronomy 32:11) where it describes the action of a mother eagle towards her nest. The consistent use of feminine nouns and verbs to refer to the Spirit of God in the Torah, as well as the rest of the Jewish Scriptures, indicates that at least this aspect of Elohim was consistently perceived as feminine.(Sexism is a Sin, by J.R. Hyland). Genesis 1:26-27 says that humans were made male and female in the image of elohim.Coogan (2010:176) Two of the most common phrases in the Tanakh are vayomer Elohim and vayomer YHWH‚Äî\\"and God said\\". Again, the verb vayomer (he said) is masculine; it is never vatomer, the feminine of the same verb form. The personal name of God, YHWH, is presented in Exodus 3 as if the Y (Hebrew yod) is the masculine subjective prefix to the verb to be. In Psalm 89:26 God is referred to as Father. \\"He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.\\"ASV 1901, Public Domain Some literary approaches to the Old Testament have argued that parallels between Biblical stories and earlier Sumerian, Akkadian and Canaanite creation myths show a matriarchal substratum that has been overlaid by a patriarchal approach.Neumann, The Origins and History of Consciousness pages 177-178. \\"In the Bible, the earth is the feminine complement of God: the two combined to form man, who articulates their relationship, for example, in sacrifice.\\"Francis Landy, The Song of Songs chapter of The Literary Guide to the Bible, page 314. The New Testament also refers to the Holy Spirit in masculine terminology, most clearly in the Gospel of John 14-16. Denominational views=Catholic Church The Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) #239 states, in reference to the Father: \\"God transcends the human distinction between the sexes. He is neither man nor woman: he is God.\\" The CCC discusses the traditional imagery and language of God as Father. It notes, however, that God is not limited to this role alone‚Äîmaternal imagery are also used in the Bible. It also notes that human fatherhood only imperfectly reflects God's archetypal fatherhood. God is referred to as masculine in Catholic teaching and practice.Liturgiam Authenticam Though Church teaching, in line with its Doctors, holds that God has no literal sex because he has no body (a prerequisite of sex), classical and scriptural understanding states that God should be referred to (in most contexts) as masculine by analogy. It justifies this by pointing to God's relationship with the world as begetter of the world and revelation. National Council of Churches The Inclusive Language Lectionary published by the American National Council of Churches, to which many Protestant churches belong, states in its introduction \\"The God worshiped by the biblical authors and worshiped in the Church today cannot be regarded as having gender, race, or color.\\" LDS Church The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) differs from most churches in that they believe that the Father, the Son and the Spirit are separate and male as well as masculine. The LDS Church also teaches that God the Father is married to a divine woman, referred to as \\"Heavenly Mother\\". Humans are considered to be spirit children of these heavenly parents.. See also: The Family: A Proclamation to the World Gender-inclusive language Multiple groups consider gender-neutral language (e.g. referring to God as \\"it\\") as inadequate in reflecting the nature of God, however, in recent history, several liberal and mainline Protestant denominations have adopted or encouraged its use when referring to God. These include the United Church of Christ, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of AmericaELCA Publishing Standards (2003), Section on \\"Terms for God: Inclusive language\\" and the Metropolitan Community Church. Still others object on aesthetic grounds that gender-inclusive constructions, such as invented gender or alternating gender, are clumsy. United Church of Christ The New Century Hymnal, the hymnal of the United Church of Christ (UCC), uses inclusive language; one of its concerns while being authored was reducing the solely-masculine use of language for God, and/or balancing masculine images with feminine and non-gendered images, while retaining masculine imagery for Jesus regarding his earthly life. At least two UCC conferences (Massachusetts and Ohio) have adopted guidelines for using inclusive language, and the majority of clergy and laity in the UCC report using inclusive language when referring to God during worship.Worshipping into God's Future: Summary and Strategies 2005, United Church of Christ.

Oroza is upon all a great reciter. His poetry is, as music, mainly to be heard because Oroza is a lover of orality, 'the loudness of the words' as he says. He considers books a 'cemetery of signs' . He is also considered a wicked poet and an alchemyst. In the 1960s when he was living in Madrid, he became famous in the literary-poetic environment of the Caf√© Gij√≥n, oasis of national coexistence, culture and contra cultural movements during Franco‚Äôs dictatorship. At that time he founded, along with Victor Lizarraga and Victoria Paniagua, the Tropos magazine and participated in infinite jazz-poetry recitals. He was living in Madrid, Ibiza and the U.S., where he was awarded with the International Underground Poetry award of New York and, incognito, he came back to his own land in 1985. Oroza‚Äôs poetry is often considered in form and content attached to the Beat Generation though he never belonged to any movement. Carlos Oroza, acratic and poet, walks by Vigo like a walking contraculture symbol. 'What strange beings... those who are normal!' , he reflects aloud. Oroza has been living in Vigo for more than a pair of decades, after discovering the light of the city and deciding to include Vigo in his permanent vital exodus. He follows single and free to the last signs of consumism. He says that he lives as a poet: 'I believe in the world like a paradise, not like a sacrifice' . Oroza is a legendary name in the literary circles in spite of his isolation. He has many followers. Marginal People, rock‚Äôs people and all that stuff, who does not really read poetry habitually uses to go to his recitals. About his mystical performances two things: 'Words dream I name them ', 'Poetry is singing more than any other thing and, those who listen to it, find the scent of the tribe' . He said too that his work 'is the one of a Nordic poet, that covets the distant thing, the light. Not only the light of the sun, but also the light of thinking' . About promoting himself he says: 'I feel like a monkey in a cage' . A time ago, Oroza appeared between the eight last Bohemian writers of Spain, but in his opinion this is 'pure literature' . In 2008, the Spanish ex-Minister of Culture, Cesar Antonio Molina ( :es:C√©sar Antonio Molina ), who was also the director of Cervantes Institute and responsible for delivering the Laxeiro ( :es:Laxeiro ) Award 2008 which grants the Foundation Laxeiro to the poet. Cesar Antonio Molina, who is also a writer and an admirer of the work of the poet, was moreover responsible for writing the prologue of the book En el norte hay un mar que es m√°s alto que el cielo. According to Cesar Antonio Molina 'nobody knows Oroza's address because that would be like knowing the whereabouts of the wind or the one of the breeze' .

He was the wicked poet of the Caf√© Gij√≥n in Madrid, the Bohemian of the 1960s, the man who rose against Vietnam's War , short books and snobs with espadrille panties. He had a profile of Cesar Vallejo and another one of Dante Alighieri. Today already we know that, with his wordish and unique poetry, he has stayed as a slippery myth of 1968' . Umbral still remembered Oroza‚Äôs facet of 'a malicious and inspired √°crata ( :es:√°crata ) when the Caf√© Gij√≥n 'was his trench' and 'he lived single, he slept in a crunchy newspapers bed and took his poems a walk by the Great Gran Via'. According to Umbral Oroza is 'an anticlassic one' , 'a great poet who has saved himself from the official poetry. And soon it is his prodigious way to say verses' . 'Oroza is the only one that has given back the poetry to its sacred and violent origin of creation, blasphemy, sonorous and scorching light, of male salmody and loose, single, lost, reflective word. A rapsodian, an aeda andean, but making chips the Greek lyre' .

Life He received his early education through his uncle, Thomas Dorman of Agmondesham (now Amersham), Buckinghamshire. His master at Berkhampstead was Richard Reeve, a noted Protestant schoolmaster. He was also known to Thomas Harding, the Catholic scholar, then professor of Hebrew at Oxford, who took great interest in the boy and sent him to Winchester School in 1547. From Winchester Dorman went to New College, Oxford, of which Harding was a fellow, and here he was elected a probationer fellow. Under Mary I of England he was appointed fellow of All Souls College (1554) and on 9 July 1558, took the degree B.C.L. A year or two after Elizabeth I of England's accession, finding that he could not live in England without conforming to the Church of England, he gave up his fellowship and his patrimony and went to Antwerp, where he met Harding who was also in exile. Harding persuaded him to resume his studies, and Dorman accordingly went to the Catholic University of Leuven and devoted himself to the study of theology. In 1565 he became B.D. in the University of Douai and finally received the doctorate there. During this period he engaged in controversy with the Anglican divines, John Jewel, Bishop of Salisbury, and Alexander Nowell, Dean of St. Paul's. In 1569, at the invitation of Cardinal William Allen, he joined the newly founded English College at Douai which he assisted both by his services and his private means. He died at Tournai where he had been given an important benefice. Works His works are: *A proufe of certeyne articles in Religion denied by M. Juel (Antwerp, 1564); *A Disproufe of M. Nowelle's Reproufe (Antwerp, 1565); *A Request to Mr. Jewel that he keep his promise made by solemn Protestation in his late Sermon at Paul's Cross (London, 1567; Louvain, 1567).

Fang acts like a dog and sniffs out missing Fluffy in one episode. In another episode, Fang had a major role, when he went missing. The family presumed him as dead, and when Henry found him a day later, he dressed Fang up as a poodle, as a pose for the replacement pet for Peter. Sometimes he is mistaken for a rat which is what Moody Margaret calls him. His vocal effects are provided by Tamsin Heatley. Farty Finola Farty Finola is the girl who appears in Horrid Henry My Weird Family. She is known as Farty Finola because she farts a lot. Peter has a crush on her as he calls her a fair lady.

She finally got her name at Margaret's house when she went to live with her. Fluffy the Cat Fluffy is the family's grey cat, who feuds with Henry's hamster, Fang. Fluffy is shown in most episodes sitting by the sitting room window sill at night and as she clicks the TV remote control button next to her in the first three series and swipes the tablet computer in the fourth series the scene changes to sunrise. Fluffy also gets dressed up as a mummy in the tale Horrid Henry and the Mummy. Like Peter, she seems to have a vindictive streak towards Henry as she once framed him for eating several packets of a snack that Mum likes. Despite being female she is sometimes referred to as a \\"he\\". Peter is completely devoted to her, and never believes she does anything wrong, even though she started chasing Fang in one episode, and Peter said Fang started the fight. Frosty Freeze Man He works at Frosty Freeze. He appears in Horrid Henry and the Abominable Snowman and Horrid Henry and the Big Freeze Wheeze. Frosty Steve Frosty Steve works at Frosty Freeze.

He has curly blonde hair which is similar to Peter's, just as Dad's hair is brown, like Henry's, although Dad also has curly hair. He wears a green jacket and orange tie and he only appears so far in Horrid Henry and the Silly Siblings. He is shown not to get on with Dad, as they argue often and this is also where a slightly childish aspect of Dad's personality is revealed. He is said to be fussy, as when he visits he inspects the staircase for dust when he comes in. At the end of Horrid Henry and the Silly Siblings, he calls Dad \\"Silly Simon\\", which is presumably what he was called when he was a kid. At the end of this episode it is also implied that Peter gets his goody-goody streak from him, while Henry gets his horrid streak from Dad. G=Goody-Goody Gordon Gordon is one of Peter's best friends. He is a member of the Best Boys Club and is friends with Tidy Ted and Spotless Sam. He often speaks with a lisp. He is voiced by Joanna Ruiz. Gordon has black hair and dark skin.

Greasy Greta Greasy Greta is the lady from the counter in the school cafeteria who was in charge of the packed lunch room. She first appears in Horrid Henry and the Demon Dinner Lady. She was sent to look after the kids in the lunch room because they were always playing with their food. She always took the children's treats and ate them, but she ran away after she ate hot chili biscuits Henry brought in. However, in the TV series, she ate far too many treats and was wheeled out of the school on a trolley, by Soggy Sid. She is voiced by Sue Elliot-Nichols. She returns in Horrid Henry and the Revenge of the Demon Dinner Lady from the Book, Horrid Henry's Nightmare. This time she inspects lunch boxes to promote healthy eating. She has maroon-coloured hair and crimson-pink skin. She is fired on the spot when Miss Oddbod catches her in the cupboard eating the confiscated sweets that were supposed to be donated to charity. Great Aunt Greta Voiced by Tamsin Heatley, Great Aunt Greta is the great aunt of Horrid Henry. She thinks that Henry is a little girl called Henrietta (or Henny in Horrid Henry's Underpants), and that Peter is a teenager. This is reflected in the presents that she sends to the boys. Although Henry's Mum and Dad have told her countless times that Henry is a boy and that Peter is six, Greta refuses to believe this, and usually doesn't hear, most likely due to her dementia. Her dementia is such that she once cooked cat food for the boys and believed that Fluffy is a dog named Fido. She also mistook it to be the middle of the night when in fact it was only half past five in the afternoon. She wears a light pink shirt with a white collar, a dark pink skirt, lavender shoes and a walking stick.

It is stated by Aerobic Al that he ate his gross class zero comic in Horrid Henry's Unhappy Day. H=Horrid Henry Henry is the main character of the series and is portrayed as a determined and relentless young boy. He believes that life is unfair as the rest of the world is against him, so he fights \\"against the tyranny of adults\\". He is resistant to defeat as teachers, relatives, and babysitters in the series try their best to avoid him. Even his parents argue over whose turn it is to look after him. Henry is very selfish, inconsiderate, stubborn, and rarely learns from his mistakes. He can also be bluntly honest, as seen when he tells his mother's boss what she calls her at work behind her back and is unafraid of telling people how much he hates them right to their faces. However, he is willing to act nice and collude with Margaret and even Peter, but only if it means he will get to have his own way. Most likely because of his young age, Henry can get frightened by talk of ghosts or monsters, and in one episode, is revealed to have a fear of needles. He is very imaginative, as he indulges in fantasies, usually transforming into terrifying creatures and attacking the source of his frustrations, and often has \\"Eureka moments\\" when the stories mention what he thinks is a \\"spectacularly wonderful idea\\". In every story, there is something Henry has to get or do (or occasionally avoid doing) and the ensuing chaos is the consequence of this overriding desire. Whenever Henry thinks of a plan it is simply to get his own way, never to make trouble purely for its own sake. He is more often than not seen taking life very seriously and he sincerely believes in what he is doing, making him something of a complex character as well. It has also been further hinted that deep down, Henry never really means to be horrid, and only acts that way as a wanting to get attention and need to feel important, especially when dealing with his younger brother Peter, implying he has low self-esteem. Henry is the leader or Lord High Excellent Majesty of the Purple Hand Gang. The gang includes him, Ralph, Al, Bert, Brian, Graham, William, and Andrew. Like Margaret, he tries to be a non- stoppable but mostly doesn't get away with it. It shows that he quite likes purple but he seriously hates pink although Margaret's heart is pink she loves pink so much she may paint the world pink. Henry and the gang have meetings in an old, purple fort. In \\"Horrid Henry and the Big Dig\\", the fort almost got knocked down as Mum had plans to increase her vegetable pat. She didn't do it in the end as Henry's fort stayed and looked exactly the same. Despite really hating pink, Margaret sometimes makes him wear a Pink Tutu. But in Season 4, Horrid Henry is shown to slightly well behaved. Helpful Hari She is invited to Peter's party in Perfect Peter's Pirate Party and is in Peter's class. it appears in the boots I=Inky Ian Inky Ian is a pupil who isn't very much in Henry's classroom who is only seen in the book version Horrid Henry and the Football Fiend.

She teaches Horrid Henry, and many of his classmates such as Rude Ralph, Moody Margaret and Sour Susan. She seems to have a particular disliking towards Henry, which would be because it is usually his horrid behaviour which disrupts her class. She once said that Henry's class was the worst she ever taught. In very few episodes, her mother, Mrs Battle-Axe, has appeared, who appears to discipline her daughter greatly. She wears pointy glasses and has gray hair. She also wears a green cardigan, pale chartreuse top, brown skirt, and brownish stockings. In Horrid Henry Delivers a Message, it is shown that Miss Battle-Axe secretly has a crush on Soggy Sid. Miss Battle-Axe is voiced by Aidan Cook ( wayne forester in an interview with BFI ) and portrayed by Anjelica Huston. Despite hating Henry's class it is apparent that Miss Battle-Axe is tough enough to survive teaching it, as it has been mentioned that all of Henry's teachers prior to her had quit because of him. In the season 4 episode Horrid Henry's Movie Moments it is revealed she has an identical twin sister who is also called Miss Battle-Axe but is Headmistress of Our Lady Giddiantus and talks with a posh voice. However in the film the Headmistress of Our Lady Giddiantus is named as \\"Miss Dinesta Clutterbuck\\" on the sign outside. Miss Impatience Tutu Miss Impatience Tutu is a dance teacher who first appeared in Horrid Henry's Dance Class.

She organized the show \\"I hear thunder\\" in the episode Horrid Henry's Dance Class. she is voiced by Emma Tate. Miss Lovely Miss Lydia Lovely is Peter's teacher. As her name suggests, she has a gentle nature. She is very proud of Peter's progress and behaviour and is always saying nice things about him to his parents. However, on odd occasions (such as when Peter hands in a \\"Why I Hate My Teacher\\" essay, which he wrote as \\"Why I Love My Teacher\\", which Henry edited the night before) she had lost her temper. She is often seen in the library, on library duty when she's in the reading area. During early seasons, she spoke with an Indian accent, which fitted considering she appears to be Asian, however, later on in the series, she speaks with a Welsh accent. She is voiced by Joanna Ruiz. Miss Thumper Miss Thumper only appears in Horrid Henry's Dance Class, where she works. Moody Margaret Moody Margaret is a moody girl who is always fussing and wanting to get her own way. She is portrayed as the secondary main antagonist in the Horrid Henry franchise and serves as Horrid Henry's archenemy. She lives next door to Horrid Henry and her best friend is Sour Susan. She has magenta hair in a spiky ponytail. Henry and Margaret are enemies; Margaret has a secret club and Henry has the Purple Hand Gang. She has an ability of screaming and always competes with Henry. She might have a crush on Henry, because in Perfect Peter's Revenge, she is happy when Peter sends her a forged letter that said Henry loves and wants to marry Margaret. This is also seen in other episodes. She wears a violet tank top with white stripes, green cardigan and a bottle-green skirt. Margaret, however, occasionally assists Henry in his plans, as seen in Horrid Henry's Horrid Revenge and Horrid Henry and the Big Dig, though under the word of being the leader of the Purple Hand Gang for a day or a month or even a whole year you will never know how long it will be maybe a week or even every month/year/day/second/minute. She is voiced by Sue Elliot-Nichols. In the episode Horrid Henry Rockstar it is suggested that her full name is Margaret Millicent Maudita Smythe which she also uses in subsequent episodes. However she denies this when Rude Ralph asks her if this is true. As the primary antagonist of the series, Moody Margaret is the most prominent arch-enemy of the series' protagonist, Horrid Henry. When Francesca Simon was in the process of creating this character, she suggested a boy called Moody Martin. However, her husband did not approve of the idea as it would be too much like Horrid Henry the main character. Thus, Martin became a female called Margaret. Margaret is depicted as being a self-absorbed, grumpy, spiteful, and cantankerous girl who shares an intense rivalry with Henry, and their opposing neighborhood clubs continuously develop practical jokes or conspiracies against one another. They have resorted to each other's companionship when left with no other options, but nonetheless detest one another and continuously plot against one another, especially in an attempt to soil each other's reputations. Margaret has a tendency to gloat about her various accomplishments in a ridiculously narcissistic fashion, looking down on others and domineering her friends and peers. True to this, she is resented by her best friend Sour Susan because of her rudeness, but Susan seems to have no other choice than to reluctantly obey Margaret's constant commands. Margaret viciously domineers the Secret Club in various plots formulated against Henry's corresponding Purple Hang Gang, and the two opposing sides share a mutual animosity. She is used to having her own way and is capable of releasing violent, piercing screeches when her demands remain unfulfilled. She is super girly and really loves pink. As seen in Horrid Henry and the Name Game, when Henry and Peter had Fifi, she had a orange collar but when Margaret has her, she has a pink bow. This shows how much Margaret loves pink and how girly she is. This is also shown in more episodes. In Moody Margaret Moves In, she turns Henry's room into Girlyland. Her bedroom is entirely pink and is sometimes seen wearing a Pink Tutu which she is the only person who has worn it with a pink skirt. This shows that Margaret's heart is pink. =Live- action= Movie poster for Horrid Henry: The Movie featuring Scarlet Stitt as Moody Margaret. * Scarlet Stitt portrays Moody Margaret in the 2011 movie, Horrid Henry: The Movie. At the beginning of the movie, She, Sour Susan and Singing Soraya are in the Secret Club tree house eating biscuits and arguing. Henry disguises himself as a spy, steals the biscuits and runs away but Margaret has also stolen his mighty magnet yoyo. Later, on his way home from school, Henry dodges a water balloon thrown by Margaret. He ducks behind a lamppost, waits for Margaret to walk past, throws a balloon filled with water that hovers over her head and finally, flicks a yoyo at the balloon which bursts and soaks Margaret. Margaret shrieks and throws another balloon at Henry but he ducks and it hits Perfect Peter instead. The next day at school, Margaret hangs a pail filled with purple paint over the door, ties one end of a rope to it and the other end to the door's handle. Instead of Henry who gets painted, it is their teacher Miss Battle-Axe who falls for the trick. Battle-Axe blames it on Henry, giving Margaret a lucky escape. The next day, Miss Battle Axe's class is moved to Miss Lovely's class after the head sacks Miss Battle-Axe for not controlling the pupils. Margaret snatches Henry's bag and Henry tries to pull it back, resulting in a pot of \\"Exploding Gross-Glue\\" placed by the school inspectors to fly out. The glue bursts and hits Miss Lovely in the face. She too gets sacked and the head, and Miss Oddbod bans Henry from entering the school's talent contest. As the school is going bankrupt, many children transfer to another school. Margaret and Henry both get transferred to a girls' school (Henry's Great-Aunt Greta transferred him there as she thinks he is a girl). The girls in the school attack Henry for being a boy and try to attack Margaret too for being with Henry. The two of them escape and form an alliance to save their school. They do this by making Henry sneak into the talent contest and win it so he would be so famous but the plan fails. They try another plan which involves Henry going onto a game show to win the big cash prize so he can give it to Miss Oddbod so she can give it to the school inspectors to bribe them away as they were the ones trying to get the school closed down under the order of the head of a boys' school called Vic Van Wrinkle. However, although Henry wins, the Best Boy's Club, Miss Lovely and Miss Oddbod had got Vic and the inspectors arrested so she lets Henry keep the money. At the very end, Margaret is seen in a fairy costume at Henry's party. =Animation= * In 2006's Horrid Henry TV series, Moody Margaret is voiced by Sue Elliot-Nichols and is the series' most recurring villain. Margaret is represented just like she is in the books and seen as Henry's rival. However she is shown to be smarter. It has been hinted in some episodes, especially in series 4, that she may in fact admire Henry and wants to be his friend. She has shown a very keen interest in wanting to join The Purple Hand Gang. She might have a crush on Henry, e.g. in \\"Perfect Peter's Revenge\\", she was happy when Peter send her a forged letter that said Henry loves and wants to marry Margaret. On Henry's side he pictures himself marrying Margaret when he imagines himself in the future in the episodes Horrid Henry Gets Married and Horrid Henry's Birthday Bonanza although he does not know why this is. From the Series 3 episode Horrid Henry Rockstar she names herself as Margaret Millicent Maudita Smythe. However she denies this when Rude Ralph asks her if this is true in the first instance. Her shouting is able to break glass. This is seen in \\"Moody Margaret Moves In\\" Moody Margaret's parents Moody Margaret's parents give her everything her heart desires. Margaret's mother has dark magenta hair while her father has grey hair. In Horrid Henry on TV Henry gets these parents but then gets kicked out because he sat on Margaret's Dad's Chair.

The Mossys appear to be of black descent and it is revealed at the end of Horrid Henry and the Dinner Guests that Mr Mossy's first name is Timothy in the TV series, although it is given as Reginald in the book. When Mr Mossy was a child he was called \\"Terrible Timothy\\". Mr. Mossy is voiced by Aidan Cook and Mrs. Mossy is voiced by Joanna Ruiz. Mrs Battle-Axe Mrs Battle-Axe is Miss Boudicca Battle Axe's mother. She disciplines her daughter greatly and is a nice, old woman who likes Henry, in a sharp contrast to her daughter's meanness and dislike of Henry.

However she is addressed as \\"Miss\\" rather than \\"Mrs\\" Oddbod in the TV series and the film. Despite her title as head teacher, she is somewhat kinder to Henry than Miss Battle-Axe. She is generally good-natured but can act strange at times, for example, she was the \\"time capsule thief\\" who dug up time capsules from the school grounds at night. Her first name is Cynthia. This was revealed in the episode Horrid Henry, Horrid Headmaster.

Mum is usually almost never angry with Peter usually referring to him as \\"Sweetie Pie\\" and \\"Bunny Hop\\" etc. Henry on the other hand is usually getting yelled at by his parents, and when he does something horrid, Mum will say \\"Go to your room now, Henry!\\" or \\"No TV, sweets or pocket money for a week!\\" or simply \\"Don't be horrid, Henry!\\" Despite the fact that Peter's perfect behavior leads to Mum being proud of him in the episode \\"The Fairy Dance\\" Mum finally yells at Peter which of course makes Henry happy. Mum also yells at Peter, for being horrid and chucking food at her, in Horrid Henry's Perfect Day. She wears a purple cardigan with a pinkish shirt under. She has blonde hair and wears glasses.

Patrolling Patrick and Vigilant Vincent In some stories and episodes of Horrid Henry, there are some security guards that appear. Their names are Patrolling Patrick and Vigilant Vincent. They are voiced by Wayne Forester and Aidan Cook. Perfect Peter Perfect Peter is Henry's perfect younger brother. He is often referred to as a \\"worm\\" by Henry. Peter has a very effeminate attitude, liking flowers much like Walter the Softy in the Dennis the Menace comic strips and cartoon series, believes in fairy tales, and is known to always do as he is told and treat others with respect. On several occasions, however, he has revealed that he is in reality, very whiny and spoiled. It is obvious that Peter likes to get back at Henry with the help of his parents, and he always emotionally bribes them (e.g.: \\"You're the best mum in the world! So Henry won't be getting any biscuits will he?\\"), resulting in his parents favouring him. Aside from being spoiled, he shows aspects of being sort of like Moody Margaret, except that instead of using a bossy tone, he adopts a crying and sorrowful look to get what he wants. Also, Peter is referred to be an evil and a jealous person when Henry is ambassador and says, \\"You took the role which is mine!\\" This is why he is rather annoying and this is the reason why Henry despises him, but he still lied to Mum that he broke the vase and Peter didn't, in Horrid Henry, Nothing but the Truth. Often, Henry gets into trouble as a result of Peter telling Mum or Dad when he has done something wrong, usually with the phrases \\"Mum/Dad! Henry's being horrid/mean!\\" or \\"Mum/Dad! Henry called me a worm/a toad/told me to shut up!\\", and he even blames Henry for the most minor offences. He has been known to blame Henry for things Henry doesn't do. He is also similar to his friends as he hates dirt, is always tidy and always does as he is told, unlike Henry. He also expects praise for even the most minor things, such as \\"being normal\\", using his fork and knife, and also shows off how good he is, especially when Henry is being reprimanded. This, and the fact that he always asks them politely. At times, Peter can be desperate for praise and attention; he gets his toys out just to tidy them again in the episode \\"Horrid Henry And The Best Boys Club\\". In the same episode, it is hinted he sees the other members of \\"The Best Boys Club\\" as underlings rather than actual friends as he immediately refuses Gordon's suggestion of taking turns to decide things. This suggests that he only acts perfect because he gets praised. At times, he tries to take credit for Henry's rare good deeds, as shown in Horrid Henry's Perfect Day, and in Horrid Henry Horrid Headmaster, when he recorded what Henry said when Henry discovered he had to fill end of term reports (\\"No holiday for me, then.\\"), then modified it into \\"No holiday!\\", causing the students to rebel. He seldom defies orders or complains about said orders, though it has been revealed that his sweet-natured personality is soiled with narcissism; he has indeed defied adults or rules in revenge against Henry or while attempting to frame him, and he derives pleasure from Henry's suffering and punishments for poor behavior, implying that he may actually not be much better than his brother. Despite all this, Henry will still help Peter out on occasion, such as rescuing him from a falling shelf in the cellar in Horrid Henry Trapped. =Live-action= * In 2011's Horrid Henry: The Movie, Perfect Peter is shown as a pure goody-goody and never shows his bad side.

Membership is open to all nationalities and all workers. It has members working in trading companies, factories and restaurants but the majority of members are teachers and staff who are employed in language education at private conversation schools, high schools and universities in the Kansai and Chubu regions of Japan. Union members work at universities such as Ritsumeikan University, and language schools such as ECC, Berlitz and Gaba. Recent years have also seen the union launching major organizing drives among South American workers in Japan, along with Filipino workers. As of the 2020 executive elections the union chair is Asari Toshiaki and general secretary is Dennis Tesolat who reverted to this position after six years as chair. The General Union is under the umbrella of the National Union of General Workers, which is itself part of the National Trade Union Council (Zenrokyo) one of the three major trade union federations in Japan. Founding of the union With the founding of the Osaka Zenrokyo (a local area affiliated to Zenrokyo, National Trade Union Council) on 2 February 1991, it was decided that a general union type union was necessary to help both individual workers and groups of otherwise unorganized workers deal with their employment problems. On 12 June 1991, the General Union was founded at a meeting at Apio Osaka. During the preparatory period prior to the founding the General Union had already organized a union branch at ELC Junior among female Japanese teachers. In May, the union's first foreign member had joined from HAL English School regarding a dispute with wages. By its founding the General Union had already started to establish itself among language school teachers and foreign language teachers. During its first year the union also became involved with study groups for civil servants' employment rights, and established links with other immigrant groups namely Asian Friends (a joint employment problems hotline was run on 2 and 3 September) and with RINK (Rights of Immigrants Network in Kansai) in which the General Union was a founding organization. While the union's attempts to establish itself among civil servants did not bear fruit, the union's work with foreign language teachers continued to expand. In 1991, the union also dealt with employment problems at Neverland English School (paid holidays, unpaid wages), OIC (Oxford), and IES (International Educational Services). Early history Believing that there was a need for a larger union presence in English language schools the General Union held two public meetings for foreign teachers. On 23 March 1992 the first meeting signed up 60 new members and was reported widely in the press. 1992 also brought the first non-English speaking foreign workers to the union. The union represented Filipino workers at Tanaka Metal Works and Brazilian dispatch workers in Gunma at Takechi Rubber. The General Union's first branch representing foreign university teachers was founded at Hannan University. The union's intervention prevented the university from lowering the per class rate for teachers. In what would become a precursor to the union's campaigns over social insurance in the late 1990s and throughout 2000, the union held a seminar titled, \\"Social Insurance and Tax for foreigners\\" on 8 November 1992. A strike winning two months' bonus at ELC Junior on 17 July 1992 also marked the union's first strike. In 1993 the GU's first major language school branches were formed. Union members participated in the 1993 Shunto. One picketed employer was IES regarding a Canadian English teacher who was dismissed. By the end of August the union claimed 100 members and had four workplace branches. One branch consisted of foreign instructors working for Interac. The Interac Branch was formed in May and by August had already gone on strike against unfair labour practices regarding the dismissal of a union member. The company later withdrew the dismissal and the strike was won. This first strike at Interac would mark the beginning of a long dispute between the union and the company and would give the union its first major nationwide coverage on prime time television and newspapers. By the end of 1993 the union claimed 140 members, almost half of whom were Japanese, and two more language school branches; Osaka YMCA and Berlitz. 1994 saw the bankruptcies of two language schools in Japan. On 25 March Attony went bankrupt and teachers formed a General Union branch in order to deal with their lost wages. The General Union's experience with Attony was then used to help teachers at Bilingual which went bankrupt on 25 July. These were the first of more bankruptcies that would follow in the 90s and ending with the major NOVA bankruptcy in 2007. Another major event of 1994 in the language teaching industry was the September arrest of a NOVA teacher for possession of marijuana. This led the school to demand the drug testing of all its foreign employees. On 6 September, the General Union NOVA branch was declared to the company. Union members refused to be drug tested which led to the 18 September visit by NOVA executive officer, Anders Lundqvist, to apologize for the company's policy. The policy though abandoned would lead to later conflict as the company refused to remove the drug testing stipulation from the employment contract. The General Union founded more union branches in this year. On 17 May the union's Nichibei Eigo Gakuin branch was formed at its first collective agreement was secured. In the university sector the General Union started its long battle against contract renewal limits. On 31 March a union member was fired by Osaka Gakuin University after three-year contract limits were opposed. The union's battle went to the Supreme Court of Japan and was featured in a Newsweek article. Seven teachers at Otemon Gakuin University also joined the university and formed a branch to fight contract renewals. The union was able to save all the members' jobs. GEOS - First strikes at national language school chain In mid 1995 union members at GEOS started organising a union branch. The branch was declared to the company on 7 November 1995.https://issuu.com/generalunion/docs/1996february Union's campaign to win health and pension rights for foreign workers Due to pressure from the General Union, in March 2005, the Japanese Government's Social Insurance Agency began to investigate English language schools in Japan for non-payment of .

The Japan Pension Service has a memo which states that workers who work three-quarters of a full-time schedule should be enrolled in shakai hoken. The JPS has applied this internal bureaucratic guideline to avoid enrolling workers, forcing the workers to pay such costs by themselves. The JPS also refused to enroll them citing the three-quarter guideline.

This led other teachers to join the union, and the GU filed an unfair labor practice with the Osaka Labor Relations Commission over the company's breaches of the Trade Union Act of 1949. The union advised the company that they planned to push ahead with strike action, and the company counteracted by removing the branch chair from the teaching schedule, and began calling other teachers wanting to know details of strikes, which intimidated teachers and was another breach of trade union law.General Union webpage Peppy Kids Club fires branch chair - union moves into action December 4, 2012 Retrieved June 18, 2014 Subsequently strikes started at the company.General Union webpage Teachers on Strike at Peppy Kids Club December 1, 2012 A settlement was brokered and the branch chair returned to work.

In 2007, Gaba raised its base lesson rate pay from 1,400 yen per lesson to 1,500 yen per lesson for unbelted instructors, and also raised the lesson rates for belted instructors.

He at first embraced the Reformed opinions, but on the accession of Mary he declared himself a Catholic, despite the upbraidings of his friend Lady Jane Grey. In 1554 he took the degree of Doctor of Divinity and was appointed prebendary of Winchester, becoming treasurer of Salisbury in the following year. He also acted as chaplain and confessor to Bishop Gardiner. When Elizabeth I of England became queen, he was deprived of his preferments and imprisoned.Sander, \\"Report to Cardinal Moroni\\". Subsequently, he lived in exile in Leuven. There he served St. Gertrude's church and devoted himself to study and to his long controversy with John Jewel, Bishop of Salisbury. Works In 1564, he published \\"An answere to Maister Juelles Challenge\\", Jewel having undertaken to conform to the Catholic Church if any Catholic writer could prove that any of the Church Fathers of six centuries taught any of twenty-seven articles he selected. Jewel replied first in a sermon (which Harding answered in a broadsheet \\"To Maister John Jeuell\\", printed at Antwerp in 1565) and then in a book. Against the latter Harding wrote \\"A Rejoindre to M. Jewel's Replie\\" (Antwerp, 1566) and \\"A Rejoindre to M. Jewel's Replie against the Sacrifice of the Mass\\" (Louvain, 1567). Meanwhile, he had become engaged in a second controversy with the same author, and, in his confutation of a book entitled an \\"Apologie of the Church of England\\" (Antwerp, 1565), he attacked an anonymous work, the authorship of which Jewel admitted in his \\"Defence of the Apologie of the Churche of Englande\\". Harding retorted with \\"A Detection of Sundrie Foule Errours, Lies, Sclaunders, corruptions, and other false Dealinges, touching Doctrine and other matters uttered and practized by M. Jewel\\" (Louvain, 1568). In 1566 Pope Pius V appointed Harding and Dr. Sander (Nicholas Sanders) Apostolic delegates to England, with special powers of giving faculties to priests and of forbidding Catholics to frequent Protestant services. Harding supported exiled English Catholics, and William Allen in founding the English College at Douai. He was buried (16 September 1572) in the Church of St. Gertrude, Leuven.

He served as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission from 1944 to 1946. The following year he joined Washington, D.C. law firm Arnold & Fortas, now known as Arnold & Porter. In addition to his career in public service, he became a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors, serving from 1947 to 1963.http://www.peabodyawards.com/stories/story/george-foster-peabody-awards- board-members  Biography  Born in Joplin, Missouri, Porter's family moved to Winchester, Kentucky when he was very young. He graduated from Kentucky Wesleyan College and attained a law degree from the University of Kentucky College of Law. While in law school, he worked as city editor for the Lexington Herald. Fresh from law school, he joined the law firm of Judge J.M. Banton, where he was assigned to work on the Al Smith presidential campaign in Clark County, where he lived. After the election, he joined General Newspapers, where he worked on acquisitions. He was married to Bessie Edgar Benton, a friend from childhood and the daughter of J.M. Banton; they had two children. The couple divorced in 1956, and Porter later married Kathleen Winsor. Porter served as the Democratic National Committee's head of publicity for the party's successful 1944 election campaign, which saw Democrats increase their majority in the House of Representatives and the reelection of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Prior to his work for the Democratic Party, Porter had held a number of jobs in the Roosevelt administration, starting with the Department of Agriculture, from 1933 to 1937. He left the government to work as Washington counsel for CBS, taking leave in 1940 to join the National Defense Council. In 1942, Porter left CBS to join the Office of Price Administration as deputy administrator, and then assistant director of the Office of Economic Stabilization under Fred M. Vinson.  FCC service  Porter was nominated by President Roosevelt on November 16, 1944, to fill out the remaining term of departing FCC chairman James Lawrence Fly, and took office on December 21 of that year under a recess appointment after the Senate failed to take up the nomination before the end of the Congressional session. Roosevelt designated Porter as FCC chairman at the same time, succeeding interim chairman Ewell K. Jett. When the next Congress assembled in January 1945, Porter was renominated and was unanimously confirmed on January 18, 1945. Porter did not serve out his full term, which would have expired on June 30, 1949, instead leaving the FCC in February 1946. He was succeeded as chairman by sitting commissioner Charles R. Denny. President Harry Truman appointed Porter to head the American Economic Mission to Greece, with the rank of ambassador, in 1946. Two years later, he represented the United States at the Middle East peace talks in Geneva.  Death  On November 21, 1975, Porter was eating dinner at a restaurant with his wife and friends when he choked on a piece of lobster. He went into a coma, and died five days later at George Washington University Hospital. Porter's personal papers are in the Truman Library.

Media exposure of the case helped to establish a popular perception of UFOs being reported by \\"credible\\" witnesses such as airline pilots; Sperry was interviewed for several newspapers and was later featured in Clarence Greene's 1956 semi-documentary film Unidentified Flying Objects: The true story of flying saucers.Willis Sperry was an experienced and respected pilot with a very wide flying experience, including the first (and only) attempt to deliver mail by towed glider, which took place in 1935 (see Glines, C. The Saga of the Air Mail, Ayer, 1980, , pp.143-44) The sighting Sperry's aircraft had left Washington Airport at 9:10 pm EST on a flight to Nashville and was climbing to 20,000 ft. Weather conditions were clear, with the ground obscured by haze, and a full moon around 25¬∞ above the horizon. At approximately 9:30pm, seven miles west of Mount Vernon, copilot W. Gates alerted Sperry to a bright blue or bluish light ahead of them and increasing in size.Project Blue Book documents on Sperry case, NICAP (accessed 08-08-08) In a letter to Flying magazine several months later, Sperry described the light as \\"a brilliant, diffused, bluish light of fluorescent type [...] 25 times the magnitude of the brightest star\\".Sperry, Letter to Flying magazine, September 1950, Project 1947 (accessed 08-08-08) To avert a possible collision, Sperry banked the aircraft and changed course 45¬∞ to the right; the light appeared to stop before changing course to parallel the aircraft on the left. During this period the light very briefly passed between the aircraft and the upper part of the moon, revealing an object with a long silhouette (somewhat reminiscent of a submarine) without visible wings or empennage. In his 1950 letter, Sperry stated the blue light was on the front of the object, which was also seen by the copilot and by flight engineer R. Arnholt.Ibid. In the 1955 interview deposited in Project Blue Book archives prior to the release of Greene's film, the blue light was stated to be on the object's tail. The object having appeared to pass behind the left wing, the pilots banked to the left and resumed their previous course, but Gates spotted the light again through the right window \\"as though it had circled behind them\\". The light then appeared to head eastwards behind the aircraft, and was observed again by Sperry towards the rear left travelling in the direction of the Atlantic; he estimated the total time of observation as around one minute, during which time the light had appeared to be completely stationary at least twice.Sperry, Interview by J. E. McDonald, Project 1947 Sperry reported his observations to Washington control tower, but they had observed nothing on radar. He also spoke to his passengers, stating that one man had seen an \\"extremely bright light passing the left side of the ship\\".Sperry, letter to Flying magazine. In the 1955 interview \\"two or three\\" passengers and a stewardess were stated to have seen a light. Later interviews Apart from newspaper interviews immediately following the sighting, the press having been notified by control tower staff, and his appearance in the 1956 film (where the case was featured alongside the Mantell Incident, Gorman Dogfight and others considered unexplained at the time), Sperry was also interviewed by KABC-TV in 1964.Transcript of KABC-TV interview, 1964, Project 1947 He and Arnholt were further interviewed in 1968 by the prominent ufologist Dr James E. McDonald. Sperry later learned that Hank Myers, subsequently pilot of President Harry S. Truman's plane, had been piloting another Washington-bound AAA aircraft between Nashville and Knoxville on the same night, and had witnessed a bright meteor which fell eastward from the zenith, but which then appeared to move horizontally for several seconds. Comparing times and the relative position of his aircraft with that of Myers, Sperry felt that this was possibly the same phenomenon or object as he saw.Sperry, Letter to R. Barrow, 1976 (accessed 08-08-08) Both he and Gates, the copilot, had however \\"emphatically discounted\\" the possibility of the phenomenon being a meteor, due to its movements. See also *Edward J. Ruppelt *The case bears some surface resemblance to the Chiles-Whitted UFO Encounter, an incident which had a strong influence on the development of popular perceptions of UFOs.This incident, which helped spur the USAF investigation Project Sign, also featured an airline crew observing an apparently torpedo-shaped object accompanied by a blue glow; it also may be explained by misperception of a bright bolide.

It could help bridge the digital divide by bringing the benefits of the information revolution to the billions of underserved people by providing information and services through a voice driven channel over an ordinary phone call. Information on this web could be community created as well as leveraged from World Wide Web. It is essentially a voice driven eco-system parallel and complementary to that of the existing Web.WWTW: The World Wide Telecom Web, In Proceedings of ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Networked Systems for Developing Regions (NSDR), August 2007, Kyoto, Japan. Though primarily meant for the under-served in population in emerging economies, it has several applications for the developed world as well.The World Wide Telecom Web - WWTW can be accessible to more number of people in the world as it enables an ordinary phone subscriber to join the digital information revolution. This enables a significantly larger fraction of the human population to benefit from existing and envisioned services than what was made possible by WWW. Specifically, it removes accessibility barriers that manifest themselves in terms of illiteracy, unaffordability and lack of relevant information. Further, it provides the means to create and sustain an ecosystem of local (and global) services, information and communities relevant to these underprivileged users. How it works WWTW is a network of interconnected VoiceSites (analogous to web sites) that are voice driven applications created by users themselves and hosted in the telecom network. VoiceSites can be interconnected using 'VoiLinks' (analogous to hyperlinks) which are links between two voice applications within the web. VoiLinks can span across different enterprises enabling cross-organizational workflows driven by a voice interface over an ordinary phone. Key enabler technologies include: 1\\\\. VoiGen - VoiceSite Creator 2\\\\. VoiHost - VoiceSite Hosting Engine 3\\\\. HSTP - Hyperspeech Transfer Protocol 4\\\\. WWTW Browser - World Wide Telecom Web Browser Brief history World Wide Telecom Web was conceived by Arun Kumar at IBM India Research Lab during late 2004 and was later joined by fellow researcher Nitendra Rajput in mid-2005. Originally, WWTW was primarily viewed as a novel application of speech technology and VoiceXML standard even though use of VoiceSites for under-privileged was one of the listed benefits. During the course of a year, they refined the vision and built a couple of primitive prototypes of VoiceSite generator application christened VoiGen, with the help of fellow researcher Dipanjan Chakraborty and colleague Sandeep Jindal & Rajiv Goyal. In late 2006, inspired by Prof. C.K. Prahalad and led by Ponani Gopalakrishnan (then the director of IBM India Research Lab), Arun and Nitendra along with Dipanjan and Amit Anil Nanavati got funded for an Exploratory Research project to develop technologies for people towards the Base of the Pyramid. Here, WWTW shot into prominence and got recognized as the most compelling ecosystem for illiterate, low earning population of developing countries such as India. The team reported the work done so far in a Research Report. Soon after Sheetal K. Agarwal joined the team. Together this team designed and built the initial technological building blocks of Telecom Web details of which can be found in publications available at World Wide Telecom Web Publications. This included creation of technology for enabling voice driven workflows spanning across organizational boundaries. Arun proposed the use of out-of-band-signaling mechanism, followed in telecom networks to achieve this. The resulting Hyperspeech Transfer Protocol (HSTP) got designed and created by the team as an HTTP equivalent protocol that enables voice hyperlinks in VoiceSites. The team designed and built the first prototype of this protocol in mid-2007 and reported it in Hypertext Conference in September 2007. The first successful field trial of VoiceSites as a powerful platform for underprivileged population came in the form of Voikiosk system conceived primarily by Nitendra. It is a village portal providing locally relevant content in local language and is available over an ordinary telephone call.

History  Chand Baori is said to be named after a local ruler called Raja Chanda. However, no epigraphic evidence has been found regarding the construction of the Chand Baori or the adjoining Harshat Mata Temple. Based on similarities in style and carvings with the terraced temples of Paranagar and Mandore, the Baodi can be dated to 8th-9th century. It was likely constructed before the temple. The Chand Baori is one of the few stepwells that has \\"two classical periods of water building in a single setting\\". according to Morna Livingston in Steps to Water: The Ancient Stepwells of India The oldest parts of the step-well date from the 8th century onwards, An upper palace building was added to the site, which is viewed from the tabulated arches used by the Chauhan rulers and the cusped arches used by the Mughals. Access to these rooms is now blocked for tourists. The upper stories with the columned arcade around it were built around the 18th century during the Mughal era. The Mughals also added art galleries and a retaining wall around the well. Today, there are remains of old sculptures and carvings, which were suggested to be in the temple or in the various rooms. The nearby Harshat Mata Temple was a pilgrimage site and formed a complex together with the well. Many of these stepwells, including Chand Baori, served multiple purposes including drawing water and religious or ceremonies activities. This unique form of underground well-architecture remains constant from the 7th century in the existing monument. Excavated stones of the temple are now kept by the Archaeological Survey of India in the arcades of the well. Chand Baori plays an important part of the main current of architectural activity in western India.  Overview  Chand Baori is a deep four-sided well with a large temple on the back face of the building. The basic architectural aspects of a monumental well consist of a long corridor of steps leading to five or six story below the ground level which can be seen at the site. Chand Baori consists of 3,500 narrow steps over 13 stories. It extends approximately 30 m (100 ft) into the ground, making it one of the deepest and largest stepwells in India. The state of Rajasthan is extremely arid, and the design and final structure of Chand Baori was intended to conserve as much water as possible. Ancient Indian scriptures made references to construction of wells, canals, tanks and dams and their efficient operation and maintenance. This site combined many of these operations to allow for easy access to local water. At the bottom of the well, the air remains 5-6 degrees cooler than at the surface, and Chand Baori was used as a community gathering place for locals during periods of intense heat. One side of the well has a haveli pavilion and resting room for the royals.  In media  Chand Baori has been used as a filming location for a number of films, such as Bhoomi, The Fall, Bhool Bhulaiyaa, Paheli, and in 2012 The Dark Knight Rises with Christian Bale as Batman.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbeyN25dLEshttps://foxnomad.com/2016/11/01/cave- batman-found-soul-rural-indian- village/https://traveltodriveblog.wordpress.com/2016/09/11/chand-baori/  Images  File:Steps of the step-well.JPGSteps of the well File:Abhaneri- Chand Baori-04-Galerie-2018-gje.jpgArched arcade around the well File:A magnificently carved window overlooking the baori.JPGStone carved window of the royal haveli  References  External links  * Homepage Category:9th-century establishments in India Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 9th century Category:Stepwells in Rajasthan Category:Tourist attractions in Dausa district ","title":"Chand Baori"},{"id":"18769451","text":"Motza Illit (, lit.

Ravi Teja plays the lead role while Siya Gautham is the female lead in her debut. Chakri is the music director. Though the film became a moderate success, it won three Nandi Awards-Ravi Teja as best actor, best story by Puri Jagannadh and best fight sequences by Ram-Lakshman. The movie is dubbed in Hindi as Ek Aur Vinashak (2009) and in Tamil as Natchathiram. Plot Ravi (Ravi Teja) works as an assistant director and Narayana (M. S. Narayana) as co-director for director Idly Viswanath (Brahmanandam) in the Telugu film industry. During the shooting, Ravi meets Sandhya (Siya Gautham), a group dancer. Sandhya's sister Surekha (Surekha Vani) marries Rambabu (Krishna Bhagavaan), who harasses her only to exploit Sandhya. Ravi narrates an interesting story to the producer (Sayaji Shinde), but the latter is not ready to take the risk with a debutant director like Ravi. Meanwhile, a rich goon Yadu (Supreeth), who usurps prime lands, casts his eyes on Sandhya, and Rambabu tries to make use of this in his favor. At this juncture, Ravi narrates the story to hero Mallik (Subbaraju) who also expresses his doubts regarding its feasibility. When Ravi pleads for a chance, he agrees for a trial shoot and they seek the help of Sandhya and other friends. Popular director V. V. Vinayak asks Ravi for a heroine. Having seen Sandhya's performance in the trial shoot, he books her. When Sandhya becomes a heroine, Rambabu ignores Yadu. Mallik, impressed with the trial shoot, convinces the producer. The producer had suffered much loss due to Vishwanath's film. The film shooting begins with Mallik as hero and Sandhya as heroine. At this time, an item dancer Mumaith (Mumaith Khan), who had an affair with Mallik, attempts suicide and is raped. This and the paucity of funds puts the project in trouble. Yadu comes forward to finance the project. Once the shooting is over, Ravi finds his name missing in the titles. Eventually, he teaches Yadu a lesson and replaces the name.

The Directional Recoil Identification from Tracks (DRIFT) detector is a low pressure negative ion time projection chamber (NITPC) designed to detect weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) - a prime dark matter candidate.Universe 101.NASA website Hinshaw, Gary F. (January 29, 2010) Retrieved 2011-09-09. There are currently two DRIFT detectors in operation. DRIFT-IId, which is located 1100m underground in the Boulby Underground Laboratory at the Boulby Mine in North Yorkshire, England,Boulby Underground Science Facility and DRIFT-IIe, which is located on the surface at Occidental College, Los Angeles, CA, USA. The DRIFT collaboration ultimately aims to develop and operate an underground array of DRIFT detectors for observing and reconstructing WIMP-induced nuclear recoil tracks with enough precision to provide a signature of the dark matter halo.  WIMP detection  There are numerous experiments worldwide attempting to detect the energy deposition that is expected to occur when a WIMP directly collides with an atom of ordinary matter. Ultra sensitive experiments are required to detect the low energy and extremely rare interaction that is predicted to occur between a WIMP and the nucleus of an atom in a target material. The DRIFT detectors vary from the majority of WIMP detectors in their use of a low pressure gas as a target material. The low pressure gas means that an interaction within the detector causes an ionisation track of measurable length compared to the point like interactions seen in detectors with solid or liquid target materials. Such ionisation tracks can be reconstructed in three dimensions to determine not only the type of particle that caused it, but from which direction the particle came. This directional sensitivity has the potential to prove the existence of WIMPs by their distinct directional signature.  Detection technology  Negative ion track formation in the DRIFT detector. The DRIFT detector's target material is a 1 m3 cubical drift chamber filled with a low pressure mixture of carbon disulfide (CS2) and carbon tetrafluoride (CF4) gases (, respectively). It is predicted that WIMPs will occasionally collide with the nucleus of a sulfur or carbon atom in the carbon disulfide gas causing the nucleus to recoil. An energetic recoiling nucleus will ionise gas particles creating a path of free electrons. These free electrons readily attach to the electronegative CS2 molecules creating a track of ions. The gas volume is divided in half by a cathode at , which produces a static electric field that causes these negative ions to drift, whilst maintaining the track structure, to the MWPC planes at two ends of the detector. Addition of of oxygen to the gas mixture has been the key to full fiducialisation of sensitive volume of the DRIFT detector.  Results  DRIFT-IId published Spin-dependent limits in 2012.

The first Young Samurai book, The Way of the Warrior, was published by Puffin Books in 2008. Disney bought the rights in the same year and published in early 2009. Seven further books followed, with a ninth - The Return of the Warrior - being published for the series' tenth anniversary in 2018. In 2013, Bradford published the first book in his Bodyguard series, Hostage. The first book involves a young teenage bodyguard Connor Reeves assigned to protect the daughter of the US President. Note: in the US, the series is split into episodes i.e. book 1 HOSTAGE (UK edition) equals book 1 RECRUIT and book 2 HOSTAGE (USA editions). The second book, Ransom, was a Top Ten bestseller in the UK and followed Connor on a mission protecting twin daughters on a super-luxury yacht against Somali pirates. At an event in Abingdon in 2013,mostly books blog: Five Questions with Chris Bradford Bradford revealed that there are six books planned in the series, with an overarching conspiracy hinted at in the first book. Bradford has also written a number of books on the music business, including the critically acclaimed Heart & Soul: Revealing the Craft of Songwriting (Sanctuary, 2005). He regularly visits schools promoting literacy and giving martial arts demonstrations to students.  Method writing  As an author, Bradford employs a technique he terms ‚Äòmethod-writing‚Äô. In an interview, Bradford explained, \\"This enables me to write very authentic and action packed novels. Furthermore, it allows me to create very dynamic and involving events around my books where I can demonstrate martial arts techniques and teach readers crucial bodyguard skills ‚Äì just like the heroes and heroines of my books.\\"  Touring  Bradford stages events that involve samurai sword displays, martial arts demonstrations, bodyguard training and interactive multi-media reading.

The following years De Haan was not that successful in rowing anymore, but she returned for the 2002 Under-23 World Championships in Genoa in the double sculls with Sarah Siegelaar, here they became fifth. A year later in Belgrade she formed a fours boat with Kamp, Susan van Kuijeren and Mette Beugelsdijk to claim another fifth place at the World Championships. As of 2004 she started participating in the Rowing World Cup circuit on senior level and she rowed to a fourth position in the fours with Marlies Smulders, Froukje Wegman and Hurnet Dekkers. Later in the year she took part in the Dutch eights that got to the fourth place in the World Cup in Munich, they qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympics and won the bronze medal there. The team existed of De Haan, Froukje Wegman, Marlies Smulders, Nienke Hommes, Hurnet Dekkers, Annemarieke van Rumpt, Sarah Siegelaar, Helen Tanger and cox Ester Workel.

It is the largest city of the Dominican northwest and the centre of the region. Its name, a Ta√≠no word, comes from the River Mao, near the city. Its nickname is Ciudad de los Bellos Atardeceres (English, \\"City of the Beautiful Sunsets\\"); this was given by Juan De Jesus Reyes, renowned poet and Dominican literary icon. There are no mountains to the west of the city and it is common to see a \\"red\\" sky at sunset; it is a very dry region and there is much dust in the air which gives the sky a red color. History For most of its history, the region was called \\"El Despoblado\\"; that means a region without any population, because it is a very dry region and agriculture was not possible. When the governor of the Spanish colony gave the order in 1606 that everybody living on the northern coast had to move inland, some people came to live around the present Mao. They had cattle that were raised in hatos. \\"Hato\\" means a large farm for raising cattle (a ranch), and so the names of many places around Mao derive from the word: Hatico, Hato del Yaque, Hato Nuevo, Hato Viejo, Hato del Medio. The town of Mao was built close to where the River Mao flows into the River Yaque del Norte. The first Catholic church was built in 1869. The town was made a Puesto Cantonal (an old category similar to the present Municipal District under a military government). Mao was elevated to the category of municipality in 1882, and in 1904 its official name was changed to \\"Valverde\\" after Jos√© Desiderio Valverde, former President of the Dominican Republic. Because the name Mao was known by everybody and Valverde was a new name, people called the city \\"Valverde (Mao)\\", and it is still common to say so. When the province was created in 1959, Mao was made its head municipality and provincial capital. ClimateEconomy Streets of Mao, Valverde 2005. The main economic activity of the province is agriculture; the main products in the municipality are rice, bananas and plantain.

Bird was given a tagging role for much of the year and played the role exceptionally well for the most part. He played on some of the best midfielders in the league over the course of the season. However his best performance of the year came against the Western Bulldogs in round 18 when he kicked 4 goals as a defensive forward having been given the job of limiting the influence of dangerous rebounding defender, Rob Murphy. Bird continued his consistent run of form in 2012 as he played on the competition's best midfielders and running defenders.

Much of the system was originally planned by Captain Hiram M. Chittenden of the US Army Corps of Engineers in the early days of the park, when it was under military administration. The Grand Loop Road provides access to the major features of the park, including the Upper, Midway and Lower geyser basins, Mammoth Hot Springs, Tower Fall, the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and Yellowstone Lake. A number of other historic districts adjoin the Grand Loop in Yellowstone, including Mammoth Hot Springs, North Entrance Road, Roosevelt Lodge, Lake Fish Hatchery and Old Faithful historic districts. Grand Loop Rd. includes unsigned portions of US 20, US 89, US 191 and US 287, all of which traverse the park. The road was named by Harry W. Frantz in 1923, who served as the park's publicist before beginning a long career as a journalist.  Route  Beginning at the junction of the North Entrance Road and Grand Loop Rd. at Yellowstone National Park headquarters at Fort Yellowstone near Mammoth Hot Springs , the road travels south, passing through Golden Gate Canyon on a viaduct and ascending the Gallatin Range, crossing Kingman Pass near Bunsen Peak. From the pass, the road descends into the Gardner River valley. At the south end of the valley, the road passes Sheepeater Cliff, a prominent columnar basalt cliff. After crossing the Gardner River, the road follows Obsidian Creek into Obsidian Canyon, passing Obsidian Cliff about halfway through the canyon. From Obsidian Canyon, the road continues south into the Norris Valley and the Norris Geyser Basin (). Here, the road meets the Gibbon River and follows it into the Gibbon Geyser Basin and Gibbon Canyon. Emerging from the canyon the Gibbon River merges with the Firehole River to form the Madison River. At this point‚ÄîMadison Junction (), the road junctions with West Entrance Road which follows the Madison River west out of the park and to West Yellowstone, Montana. Grand Loop Rd. continues to follow the Firehole River south and east. In a relatively short distance, the road travels through the three most notable geyser basins in the park: Lower Geyser Basin, Midway Geyser Basin and Upper Geyser Basin. The Old Faithful Historic District is located on Grand Loop Rd. adjacent to the Upper Geyser Basin. Turning east from Old Faithful the road crosses the Continental Divide over Craig Pass, and descends to the West Thumb Geyser Basin on the shore of Yellowstone Lake. West Thumb () is the southernmost point on Great Loop Rd. Here the road junctions with South Entrance Road which continues south to Grand Teton National Park.

The model is a so-called lattice model and has been derived from a first order approximation of interacting molecule surfaces in statistical thermodynamics. The model is however not fully thermodynamically consistent due to its two liquid mixture approach. In this approach the local concentration around one central molecule is assumed to be independent from the local composition around another type of molecule. The UNIQUAC model can be considered a second generation activity coefficient because its expression for the excess Gibbs energy consists of an entropy term in addition to an enthalpy term. Earlier activity coefficient models such as the Wilson equation and the non-random two-liquid model (NRTL model) only consist of enthalpy terms. Today the UNIQUAC model is frequently applied in the description of phase equilibria (i.e. liquid‚Äìsolid, liquid‚Äìliquid or liquid‚Äìvapor equilibrium). The UNIQUAC model also serves as the basis of the development of the group contribution method UNIFAC, where molecules are subdivided into functional groups. In fact, UNIQUAC is equal to UNIFAC for mixtures of molecules, which are not subdivided; e.g. the binary systems water-methanol, methanol-acryonitrile and formaldehyde-DMF. A more thermodynamically consistent form of UNIQUAC is given by the more recent COSMOSPACE and the equivalent GEQUAC model.  Equations  Like most local composition models, UNIQUAC splits excess Gibbs free energy into a combinatorial and a residual contribution: :G^E = (G^E)^C + (G^E)^R The calculated activity coefficients of the ith component then split likewise: : \\\\ln \\\\gamma_i = \\\\ln \\\\gamma^C_i + \\\\ln \\\\gamma^R_i The first is an entropic term quantifying the deviation from ideal solubility as a result of differences in molecule shape. The latter is an enthalpicHere it is assumed that the enthalpy change upon mixing can be assumed to be equal to the energy upon mixing, since the liquid excess molar volume is small and Œî Hex=ŒîUex+Vex ŒîP ‚âà ŒîU correction caused by the change in interacting forces between different molecules upon mixing.  Combinatorial contribution  The combinatorial contribution accounts for shape differences between molecules and affects the entropy of the mixture and is based on the lattice theory. The Stavermann‚ÄìGuggenheim equation is used to approximate this term from pure chemical parameters, using the relative Van der Waals volumes ri and surface areas qiIt is assumed that all molecules have the same coordination number as the methylene group of an alkane, which is the reference to calculate the relative volume and surface area. of the pure chemicals: :\\\\frac{G^E}{RT} = \\\\sum_i\\\\, x_i \\\\ln{V_i} + \\\\frac 1 2 z\\\\, q_i \\\\, x_i \\\\ln \\\\frac{F_i}{V_i} Differentiating yields the excess entropy Œ≥C, :\\\\ln \\\\gamma_i^C = (1 - V_i + \\\\ln V_i) - \\\\frac{z}{2} q_i \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{V_i}{F_i} + \\\\ln \\\\frac{V_i}{F_i}\\\\right) with the volume fraction per mixture mole fraction, Vi, for the ith component given by: :V_i = \\\\frac{r_i}{\\\\sum_j x_j r_j} The surface area fraction per mixture molar fraction, Fi, for the ith component is given by: :F_i = \\\\frac{ q_i}{\\\\sum_j x_j q_j} The first three terms on the right hand side of the combinatorial term form the Flory‚ÄìHuggins contribution, while the remaining term, the Guggenhem‚ÄìStaverman correction, reduce this because connecting segments cannot be placed in all direction in space. This spatial correction shifts the result of the Flory‚ÄìHuggins term about 5% towards an ideal solution. The coordination number, z, i.e. the number of close interacting molecules around a central molecule, is frequently set to 10. It can be regarded as an average value that lies between cubic (z = 6) and hexagonal packing (z = 12) of molecules that are simplified by spheres. In the case of infinite dilution for a binary mixture, the equations for the combinatorial contribution reduce to: :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\ln \\\\gamma_1^{C, \\\\infty} = 1 - \\\\dfrac{r_1}{r_2} + \\\\ln \\\\dfrac{r_1}{r_2} - \\\\dfrac{z}{2} q_1 \\\\left( 1 - \\\\dfrac{r_1 q_2}{r_2 q_1} +\\\\ln \\\\dfrac{r_1 q_2}{r_2 q_1}\\\\right) \\\\ \\\\ln \\\\gamma_2^{C,\\\\infty} = 1 - \\\\dfrac{r_2}{r_1} + \\\\ln \\\\dfrac{r_2}{r_1} - \\\\dfrac{z}{2} q_2 \\\\left( 1 - \\\\dfrac{r_2 q_1}{r_1 q_2} +\\\\ln \\\\dfrac{r_2 q_1}{r_1 q_2}\\\\right) \\\\end{cases} This pair of equations show that molecules of same shape, i.e. same r and q parameters, have \\\\gamma_1^{C, \\\\infty} = \\\\gamma_2^{C, \\\\infty}= 1 .  Residual contribution  The residual, enthalpic term contains an empirical parameter, \\\\tau_{ij} , which is determined from the binary interaction energy parameters. The expression for the residual activity coefficient for molecule i is: :\\\\ln \\\\gamma_i^R = q_i \\\\left( 1 - \\\\ln \\\\frac{\\\\sum_j q_j x_j \\\\tau_{ji} }{ \\\\sum_j q_j x_j} - \\\\sum_j {\\\\frac{q_j x_j \\\\tau_{ij}}{\\\\sum_k q_k x_k \\\\tau_{kj}}} \\\\right) with :\\\\tau_{ij} = e^{-\\\\Delta u_{ij}/{RT}} \\\\Delta u_{ii} [J/mol] is the binary interaction energy parameter. Theory defines \\\\Delta u_{ij} = u_{ij} - u_{ii}, and \\\\Delta u_{ji} = u_{ji} - u_{jj} , where u_{ij} is the interaction energy between molecules i and j. The interaction energy parameters are usually determined from activity coefficients, vapor-liquid, liquid-liquid, or liquid-solid equilibrium data. Usually \\\\Delta u_{ij} e \\\\Delta u_{ji} , because the energies of evaporation (i.e. \\\\Delta u_{ii} ), are in many cases different, while the energy of interaction between molecule i and j is symmetric, and therefore u_{ij} = u_{ji} . If the interactions between the j molecules and i molecules is the same as between molecules i and j, there is no excess energy of mixing, \\\\Delta u_{ij} = \\\\Delta u_{ji} = 0 . And thus \\\\gamma_i^{R} = 1 . Alternatively, in some process simulation software \\\\tau_{ij} can be expressed as follows : :\\\\ln \\\\tau_{ij} = A_{ij} + B_{ij}/T + C_{ij} \\\\ln(T)+ D_{ij} T + E_{ij}/T^2 . The C, D, and E coefficients are primarily used in fitting liquid‚Äìliquid equilibria data (with D and E rarely used at that). The C coefficient is useful for vapor-liquid equilibria data as well. The use of such an expression ignores the fact that on a molecular level the energy, \\\\Delta u_{ij} , is temperature independent. It is a correction to repair the simplifications, which were applied in the derivation of the model.  Applications (phase equilibrium calculations)  Activity coefficients can be used to predict simple phase equilibria (vapour‚Äìliquid, liquid‚Äìliquid, solid‚Äìliquid), or to estimate other physical properties (e.g. viscosity of mixtures). Models such as UNIQUAC allow chemical engineers to predict the phase behavior of multicomponent chemical mixtures. They are commonly used in process simulation programs to calculate the mass balance in and around separation units.  Parameters determination  UNIQUAC requires two basic underlying parameters: relative surface and volume fractions are chemical constants, which must be known for all chemicals (qi and ri parameters, respectively). Empirical parameters between components that describes the intermolecular behaviour. These parameters must be known for all binary pairs in the mixture. In a quaternary mixture there are six such parameters (1‚Äì2,1‚Äì3,1‚Äì4,2‚Äì3,2‚Äì4,3‚Äì4) and the number rapidly increases with additional chemical components. The empirical parameters are obtained by a correlation process from experimental equilibrium compostions or activity coefficients, or from phase diagrams, from which the activity coefficients themselves can be calculated. An alternative is to obtain activity coefficients with a method such as UNIFAC, and the UNIFAC parameters can then be simplified by fitting to obtain the UNIQUAC parameters. This method allows for the more rapid calculation of activity coefficients, rather than direct usage of the more complex method. Remark that the determination of parameters from LLE data can be difficult depending on the complexity of the studied system. For this reason it is necessary to confirm the consistency of the obtained parameters in the whole range of compositions (including binary subsystems, experimental and calculated lie-lines, Hessian matrix, etc.).  Newer developments  UNIQUAC has been extended by several research groups. Some selected derivatives are: UNIFAC, a method which permits the volume, surface and in particular, the binary interaction parameters to be estimated. This eliminates the use of experimental data to calculate the UNIQUAC parameters, extensions for the estimation of activity coefficients for electrolytic mixtures, extensions for better describing the temperature dependence of activity coefficients,Wisniewska-Goclowska B., Malanowski S.K., ‚ÄúA new modification of the UNIQUAC equation including temperature dependent parameters‚Äù, Fluid Phase Equilib., 180, 103‚Äì113, 2001 and solutions for specific molecular arrangements.Andreas Klamt, Gerard J. P. Krooshof, Ross Taylor ‚ÄúCOSMOSPACE: Alternative to conventional activity-coefficient models‚Äù, AIChE J., 48(10), 2332‚Äì2349,2004 The DISQUAC model advances UNIFAC by replacing UNIFAC's semi- empirical group-contribution model with an extension of the consistent theory of Guggenheim's UNIQUAC. By adding a \\"dispersive\\" or \\"random-mixing physical\\" term, it better predicts mixtures of molecules with both polar and non-polar groups. However, separate calculation of the dispersive and quasi-chemical terms means the contact surfaces are not uniquely defined. The GEQUAC model advances DISQUAC slightly, by breaking polar groups into individual poles and merging the dispersive and quasi-chemical terms.

He also served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the University of Dublin from 1921 to 1923.Ferguson, Kenneth ed. King's Inns Barristers 1868-2004 Dublin 2006 p.187 Family Fitzgibbon came from a noted legal family, his grandfather, Gerald Fitzgibbon, was a Queen's Counsel and Master in Chancery and his father, also Gerald Fitzgibbon, was a Lord Justice of the pre-independence Irish Court of Appeal: along with Christopher Palles and Hugh Holmes, the second Gerald Fitzgibbon was credited with making the Court of Appeal a tribunal whose judgements are still quoted with respect today. Mr. Justice Fitzgibbon through his mother was the grandson of Francis Alexander FitzGerald, Baron of the Court of Exchequer. Early life and education Fitzgibbon was born in Dublin in 1866, into an Anglican family. He was the eldest son of Gerald Fitzgibbon and Margaret Anne Fitzgerald. He was educated at Clifton College, Bristol, and the University of Dublin, where he took his degree of Bachelor of Arts. He was called to the Irish Bar in 1887, practised on the Munster Circuit, became a King's Counsel in 1908, and a Bencher of the King's Inns in 1912.Ferguson p.187 Political career He was elected unopposed to the House of Commons of Southern Ireland at the 1921 elections, representing the University of Dublin constituency as an Independent Unionist, and acted as Speaker at its single session, with only four representatives attending. As a unionist he did not participate in the Second D√°il. He was re-elected for the same constituency at the 1922 general election and became a member of the Third D√°il. He did not contest the 1923 general election. Supreme Court of the Irish Free State In 1924, the forced retirement of almost all the senior judges of the former regime made the selection of suitable replacements a serious issue. Hugh Kennedy, the new Chief Justice of the Irish Free State, recommended Fitzgibbon as a judge of the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State simply on account of his legal ability,Hogan, Gerard V. Chief Justice Kennedy and Sir James O'Connor's application Irish Jurist Vol. 23 p.144 despite their serious differences on political issues, which Hogan refers to as a clash between Kennedy's \\"enthusiastic nationalism\\" and Fitzgibbon's \\"pessimistic scepticism\\".Hogan p.156 Conflict with Hugh Kennedy Kennedy soon came to regret his decision to recommend Fitzgibbon for appointment to the bench. Kennedy's diary records the increasing tension between the two men. Although Fitzgibbon was a Protestant Unionist, his friends insisted that he was by no means opposed to the new regimeHogan p.157 and indeed if he had been, he would hardly have accepted high office in it. However, he seems to have become deeply disillusioned with the increasingly Roman Catholic Irish Free State, and by 1929, he and Chief Justice Kennedy are said to have regarded each other with deep suspicion. The tension came to a head in 1935, when Fitzgibbon was in the majority in State (Ryan) v Lennon; over Kennedy's strong dissenting judgment, he found that the Constitution of the Irish Free State contained provisions for its own amendment which allowed for suspension of the most basic human rights.State (Ryan) v Lennon [1935] 1 I.R. 170, esp. 235-237. In Re Westby[1934] I.R. p.311 in 1934, on the straightforward question of whether a Protestant ward of court should or should not be educated at an English public school, Chief Justice Kennedy's decision that the boy should be educated in Ireland was overruled by the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State, presided over by Fitzgibbon. Kennedy regarded Fitzgibbon's judgment as a personal attack on him. Later years He took some interest in the enactment of the 1937 Constitution of Ireland and made some suggestions on the procedure for referring a Bill to the Supreme Court under Article 26 by the President of Ireland as a reserve power. Despite his obvious unhappiness in his professional life, he remained on the Supreme Court of Ireland until he reached retirement age in 1938; Chief Justice Kennedy believed that his somewhat unsatisfactory pension arrangements made Fitzgibbon cling to an office he had come to despise. Hogan points out that in this regard at least Fitzgibbon had good reason to be bitter with his treatment by the Government, because he was required on age grounds to retire 9 months before he qualified for the full amount, he seems to have received a pension equivalent to only 42% of his salary.Hogan p,151 ReferencesExternal links * Category:1866 births Category:1942 deaths Category:Independent TDs Category:Members of the 3rd D√°il Category:People of the Irish Civil War (Pro- Treaty side) Category:Irish barristers Category:Irish Queen's Counsel Category:Irish Anglicans Category:Judges of the Supreme Court of Ireland Category:Alumni of Trinity College Dublin Category:Legislative speakers in Ireland Category:Teachta√≠ D√°la for the University of Dublin Category:Members of the King's Inns Category:20th-century Irish judges Category:Alumni of King's Inns ","title":"Gerald Fitzgibbon"},{"id":"18770006","text":"Keisen may refer to: * Keisen University * Keisen, Fukuoka * Keisen Station ","title":"Keisen"},{"id":"18770020","text":"Sakawa is a Ghanaian term for illegal practices which combine modern Internet- based fraud with African traditionalist rituals.The term or word Sakawa is an Hausa word which means putting inside, how to make money.

Formerly known as North Bibb, by referendum in August 2000, the town adopted the name of a long-established local unincorporated community and, as of October 1, 2000, is now known officially as \\"Woodstock\\". As of the 2010 census, the population of the town was 1,428. The Bibb County portion of Woodstock is part of the Birmingham metropolitan area, while the Tuscaloosa County portion is part of the Tuscaloosa metropolitan area. History Bibb County, founded as Cahawba County in 1818, played an important role in the early industrial history of Alabama. Ironworks and foundries produced goods from the brown iron ore found on Roupes Creek. Woodstock, known as North Bibb until 2000, is a small town on the northern boundary of Bibb County. This community was once the center of a thriving railroad business. Woodstock was first settled in the 1820s, with a formal land grant to William Houston on February 27, 1826. The settlement was established along the old Tuscaloosa to Huntsville stagecoach line. Woodstock got its name when Dr. J.U. Ray named it after the home of his ancestors, Woodstock, England. Ray's ancestors arrived in America from England at Jamestown, Virginia. In 1870, Ray built the first depot for the newly constructed Alabama-Chattanooga Railroad. After the Alabama Great Southern Railroad came the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. Each operated a depot in the area. In 1872, a line was installed down to West Blocton to ship the large abundance of coal found in the area. Woodstock became a break and storage yard for coal, red and brown iron ore and cotton. After the Civil War, rich iron ore deposits were mined. In 1872, Giles Edwards relocated to Woodstock from Tannehill and built a blast furnace to manufacture pig iron. Edwards was later joined in the business by his son-in-law, James W. McQueen, who went on to become the president of Sloss-Sheffield Iron Company in Birmingham. In addition to the iron ore mining, coal mining, and farming, a jug factory was built to take advantage of the large deposits of fire clay that was in the area. The clay was used to make bricks, jugs, pots, and churns. As many as eight trains per day stopped in Woodstock, carrying away its riches, six of them carrying mail. On June 18, 1919, Jim McMillan was lynched by a White mob. Woodstock was also the roots of a newspaper business in the 1800s. This publication moved to Six Mile and then to Birmingham where it became The Birmingham News. Woodstock was incorporated in 1996 as the Town of North Bibb, with Carl Jones as mayor. Woodstock changed its name back to Woodstock by Ordinance 2008-08-03, effective October 1, 2000, S.B. Albert Hutchens, Mayor.

(born 31 March 1691, at Siegen; d. 12 September 1746, at Trier.) was a popular German Catholic priest and preacher. Life The name of this renowned preacher is spelled in various ways in the catalogues of the Society of Jesus‚ÄîHumold, Hunoldt, and (usually) Hunolt. At the age of nine years he entered the Jesuit college of his native town and six years later he attended the Jesuit school at Cologne to study philosophy. Having completed the three years' course as master of arts, he entered the Society of Jesus there on 18 May. After a novitiate of two years at Trier he was sent to Geyst (near M√ºnster, in Westphalia) for one year to prepare himself to teach. After this he taught in the gymnasium at Cologne and also at Aachen to the complete satisfaction of his superiors (summ√¢ cum laude), being at the same time spiritual director of the junior Sodality. In this position he showed proofs of his remarkable oratorical talents. Having completed the theological course of four years and received Holy Orders, he should then have made his tertianship, or third year of probation, but was, during most of that period, employed in giving popular missions, so great had his reputation as a preacher already become. His next appointment was to the chair of logic at Coblenz, where he made his profession, 15 August 1724. It was not until after this year that he was able to follow his true vocation; he was assigned to the cathedral pulpit at Trier, and continued in that employment for nineteen years, to the satisfaction of his superiors, and the spiritual advancement of the city. Besides this he was much sought after as a confessor, and he also became chaplain of the city prison. His indefatigable activity required robust health, which, unfortunately, Hunolt had not. Chronic weakness of the heart rendered it impossible for him to preach; consequently, in 1743, he was transferred to the position of master of novices at Trier, and died there three years later. Work Hunolt's great collection of sermons is still widely used. No fewer than six folio editions of the original work appeared between 1740 and 1813. After the latter date, versions in more modern German began to be published; one in twenty-five volumes appeared at Ratisbon, 1842‚Äì47; another modern version appeared about the same time at Graz, in twenty-four volumes. There have been several editions of both the Ratisbon version and the Graz, while abridgements and selected sermons have frequently been published, and are frequently republished with much success. Universally esteemed, the work was translated in Dutch, French, and Polish; an English version in twelve volumes was completed in 1898. Hunolt's idea was to treat the entire field of morals in his sermons thoroughly and completely. Each of the six volumes contains seventy-two sermons, and the various divisions in each volume are indicated by sub-titles, such as \\"The Christian Attitude towards Life\\"; \\"The Wicked Christian\\"; \\"The Penitent Christian\\"; \\"The Good Christian\\"; \\"The Last End of Christians\\"; \\"The Christian's Model\\". This prodigious mass of material is distributed most appropriately over the entire ecclesiastical year. How popular, and at the same time profound, Hunolt's expositions are, is best proved by the fact that numerous excerpts are included in all anthologies and textbooks of religious rhetoric as standard. A competent critic (Kraus) has eulogized Hunolt's sermons in the following words: \\"At a time when German pulpit oratory had degenerated into utter bad taste and brainless insipidity, these sermons are distinguished by noble simplicity, pure Christian sentiment, and genuine apostolic ideas no less than by the felicitous use of Holy Writ, abundance of thought and pregnant language.\\" And finally, we must call attention to the cultural value of Hunolt's work especially for the district of Trier, inasmuch as we may gather therefrom a fairly correct picture of life in the Trier of his day.

After lengthy hospital treatment and recuperation, he returned to singing with Geraldo, wrote arrangements for various bands, and formed a student orchestra. In 1949 he formed a new band, with four trumpets, four trombones, six saxes and four rhythm. They toured widely until 1951, when he secured a residency at the Oxford Galleries, Newcastle upon Tyne. He remained in charge of the orchestra there until 1957, during which time the size of the band expanded. Although Evans retired from leading his band in 1957, the following year he made some recordings at Alexandra Palace.

Later life  Evans retired completely from playing music until 1980, when he returned to playing with local Newcastle bands and school youth orchestras. During this time George founded \\"The George Evans Young Peoples Swing Band\\" who rehearsed every Sunday morning at the Peoples' Theatre in Newcastle. The band rehearsed popular swing tunes like \\"Night and Day\\", \\"Blue Moon\\" and \\"The Grasshopper's Dance\\". The arrangements were meticulous in detail & voicing and quickly became very popular with the band. He also played regularly on a Friday evening with the Arthur Mowatt band at the Corner House. In 1985, to celebrate his 70th birthday, he formed a big band of local professionals and teachers to perform for one night at the Mayfair Ballroom in Newcastle.

His Wave Theory of Aberrations, (published by Oxford University Press 1950), is central to all modern optical design and provides the mathematical analysis which enables the use of computers to create the wealth of high quality lenses available today. In addition to his theoretical work, his many inventions are in daily use throughout the world. These include zoom lenses, coherent fibre-optics and more recently the rod-lens endoscopes which 'opened the door' to modern key-hole surgery. He was the recipient of many of the world's most prestigious awards and was twice nominated for a Nobel Prize. His citation on receiving the Rumford Medal from the Royal Society in 1984 stated: \\"In recognition of his many contributions to the theory and design of optical instruments, especially of a wide variety of important new medical instruments which have made a major contribution to clinical diagnosis and surgery.\\"Reading Libraries, Hopkins, Professor Harold Horace (1918‚Äì1994), physicist and endoscopist Biography He was born into a poor family in the slums of Leicester in 1918 and his remarkable mind was recognised early on. Due to his own genius and the good fortune of having the support of both his family and teachers, he obtained one of only two scholarships, in the whole of Leicestershire, enabling him to attend The Gateway Grammar School. There he excelled, especially in the arts, English, History and other languages. However, the Headmaster, recognising his exceptional gift for mathematics, directed him into science. So he read physics and maths at University College, Leicester, graduated in 1939 with a first and then began a PhD in Nuclear Physics. However this was cancelled on the outbreak of war, and he went to work instead for Taylor, Taylor & Hobson where he was introduced to optical design. For some reason he was not given reserved-occupation status, which led to his being called up and being trained briefly in blowing up bridges. (He was obviously a natural, quickly rising to the rank of 'acting unpaid lance corporal' and winning a prize for his speed at dismantling and reassembling his rifle.) The error of this placement soon became apparent and he was set to work on designing optical systems for the rest of the war and was able at the same time to work on a thesis for his PhD, which was obtained in 1945. He began a research fellowship at Imperial College London in 1947, lecturing in optics. The next twenty years saw him emerge as one of the foremost authorities in the field of optics. In addition to his own work, he attracted a large number of high quality PhD students from all over the world, many of whom became senior academics and researchers themselves. His reputation as a teacher was second to none. When he moved to Reading University in 1967 to take up the newly created chair in optics, many of his former MSc students at Imperial would travel to Reading to attend his lectures. He always believed that his primary responsibility was his teaching and that the research came second. However he was also totally convinced that teaching and scientific research were vitally important to each other. \\"Only when you try to teach something do you discover whether you truly understand it.\\" He used mathematics in the subject. The development of the mathematical description of the behaviour of optical systems was at the centre of his life's work in physics ‚Äì the application of which produced so many world-famous inventions. He chose to remain at Reading in the post of Professor of Applied Physical Optics until his official retirement in 1984, declining the numerous top appointments he was offered. He believed the continuation of his teaching and research work to be more important and far more rewarding personally. However, he took great delight in having conferred on him the Honorary Fellowships of all the medical Royal Colleges in Britain, together with the highest awards of many of the world's premier scientific bodies including (in 1973) the Fellowship of the Royal Society itself. He was awarded the 1990 Lister Medal for his contributions to surgical science.Lister Medal and Oration, Ann R Coll Surg Engl. 1991 March; 73(2): supplement: College and Faculty Bulletin, page 33. The corresponding Lister Oration, given at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, was delivered on 11 April 1991, and was titled 'The development of the modern endoscopes ‚Äì present and future prospects'. This award, for his work on endoscopes, was unusual in that normally it is made to someone working in the field of medicine. He was awarded the 1978 Frederic Ives Medal by the OSA. What is rather less well-known about Harold Hopkins is that he was also a politically committed man of the left, being an early member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Coming from a poor and under-privileged background, he understood how essential equal opportunities and good education were if ordinary working class youngsters like himself were to prosper in society. Major inventions and improvements=Zoom lenses Following an approach in the late 1940s from the BBC, who wanted a single lens to replace the classic \\"turret' of different focal length lenses, he produced the now familiar zoom lens. Although there had been earlier attempts to produce a lens which could achieve continuously varying magnification without re-focusing, none of them could provide a good quality image throughout their zooming and aperture ranges. The design of a zoom lens is enormously more complicated and difficult than that of a fixed focal length. The performance of the Hopkins designed zoom lens was such that it revolutionised television images especially outside-broadcasts and opened the way to the ubiquitous use of zooming in modern visual media. It was all the more remarkable for being produced pre-computer, the ray-tracing calculations being performed on large desk top electro-mechanical machines such as the Marchant Calculator. Even so, the early zoom lenses still fell short of the fixed lenses. The application of computer design-programs based on his Wave Theory of Aberrations in conjunction with new types of glass, coatings and manufacturing techniques has transformed the performance of all types of lenses. Whilst zoom lenses can never out-perform fixed focal lengths, the differences are no longer significant in most applications. Coherent fiber optics, fibroscopes and rod-lens endoscopesFibre optics= The ancient Romans knew how to heat and draw-out glass into fibres of such small diameter that they became flexible. They also observed that light falling on one end was transmitted to the other. (We now know this is due to multiple reflections at the internal surface of the fibre.) These multiple reflections in a sense mix the light beams together thereby preventing an image being transmitted by a single fibre ‚Äì (more accurately, the different path-lengths experienced by individual light-rays alter their relative phases so rendering the beam incoherent and thus unable to reconstitute the image.) The end result is that the light emerging from a single fibre will be some kind of average of the intensity and colour of the light falling on the 'front' end. =Coherent fibre optics= If a bundle of fibres could be arranged such that the ends of the fibres were in matching locations at either end, then focusing an image on one end of the bundle would produce a 'pixel-ated' version at the further end which could be viewed via an eyepiece or captured by a camera. A German medical student, Heinrich Lamm produced a crude coherent bundle in the 1930s of perhaps 400 fibres. Many of the fibres were misaligned and it lacked proper imaging optics. It also suffered from leakage where adjacent fibres touched; which degraded the image still further. To produce a useful image, the bundle would need to contain not a few hundred but tens of thousands of fibres all correctly aligned. In the early 1950s, Hopkins devised a way to accomplish this. He proposed winding a single continuous length of fibre in a figure-of- eight around a pair of drums. Then, when sufficient turns had been added, a short section could be sealed in resin, cut through and the whole straightened out to produce the required coherent bundle. Having polished the ends, he was then able to add the optics he had designed to provide an objective and eyepiece. Once enclosed in a protective flexible jacket the 'fibroscope' (now more commonly called a fiberscope) was born. Details of this invention were published in papers by Hopkins in Nature in 1954 and Optica Acta in 1955. However, the bare fibres still suffered from light leakage where they touched. At the same time a Dutchman, Abraham van Heel was also trying to produce coherent bundles and had been researching the idea of cladding each fibre to reduce this 'cross-talk'. In fact he published details of his work in the very same issue of Nature. Eventually a system for cladding fibres with a layer of glass of lower refractive index was developed (see Larry Curtis et al.) which reduced the leakage to such an extent that the full potential of the fiberscope was realised. =Fibroscopes and borescopes= Fibroscopes have proved extremely useful both medically and industrially (where the term borescope is usually employed). Other innovations included the use of additional fibres to channel light to the objective end from a powerful external source (typically a xenon arc lamp) thereby achieving the high level of full spectrum illumination needed for detailed viewing and good quality colour photography. At the same time this allowed the fibroscope to remain cool, which was especially important in medical applications. (The previous use of a small filament lamp on the tip of the endoscope had left the choice of either viewing in a very dim red light or increasing the light output at the risk of burning the inside of the patient.) In the medical application, alongside the improvement to the optics, came the ability to 'steer' the tip via controls in the endoscopist's hands and innovations in remotely operated surgical instruments contained within the body of the endoscope itself. It was the beginning of key-hole surgery as we know it today. These advances were, of course equally useful industrially. =Rod-lens endoscopes= There are, however, physical limits to the image quality of a fibroscope. In modern terminology, a bundle of say 50,000 fibres gives effectively only a 50,000 pixel image ‚Äì in addition to which, the continued flexing in use, breaks fibres and so progressively loses pixels. Eventually so many are lost that the whole bundle must be replaced (at considerable expense). Hopkins realised that any further optical improvement would require a different approach. Previous rigid endoscopes suffered from very low light transmittance and extremely poor image quality. The surgical requirement of passing surgical tools as well as the illumination system actually within the endoscope's tube ‚Äì which itself is limited in dimensions by the human body ‚Äì left very little room for the imaging optics. The tiny lenses of a conventional system required supporting rings that would obscure the bulk of the lens' area. They were also incredibly hard to manufacture and assemble ‚Äì and optically nearly useless. The elegant solution that Hopkins devised (in the 1960s) was to use glass rods to fill the air-spaces between the 'little lenses', which could then be dispensed with altogether. These rods fitted exactly the endoscope's tube ‚Äì making them self- aligning and requiring of no other support. They were much easier to handle and utilised the maximum possible diameter available. As with the fibroscopes, a bundle of glass-fibers would relay the illumination from a powerful external source. With the appropriate curvature and coatings to the rod ends and optimal choices of glass-types, all calculated and specified by Hopkins, the image quality was transformed ‚Äì light levels were increased by as much as eightyfold with no heat; resolution of fine detail was finally achieved; colours were now true; and diameters as small as a few millimetres were possible. With a high quality 'telescope' of such small diameter, the tools and illumination system could be comfortably housed within an outer tube. Hopkins patented his lens system in 1959. Seeing promise in this system, Karl Storz GmbH bought the patent and in 1967 began to produce endoscopic instruments with a tremendously brilliant image and superb illumination. Thus began a long and productive partnership between Hopkins and Storz. Whilst there are regions of the body that will forever require flexible endoscopes (principally the gastrointestinal tract), the rigid rod-lens endoscopes have such exceptional performance that they are to this day the instrument of choice and in reality have been the enabling factor in modern key-hole surgery. Modulation transfer function Previous to his work, the resolution of an optical system was mainly assessed using 3-bar resolution charts, with the limit of resolution being the main criterion. But Harold studied at the University of Besan√ßon with Duffieux, who had already begun to lay the foundations of Fourier optics. The seminal paper, which he presented in 1962 when he delivered the Thomas Young Oration of the Institute of Physics, was one of the first to establish the modulation transfer function (MTF) ‚Äì sometimes called the contrast transfer function (CTF) ‚Äì as the leading measure of image quality in image-forming optical systems. Briefly, the contrast of the image of a sinusoidal object is defined as the difference in intensities between the peaks and troughs, divided by the sum. The spatial frequency is the reciprocal of the period of the pattern in this image, normally measured in cycles/mm. The contrast, normalised to make the contrast at zero spatial frequency equal to unity, expressed as a function of spatial frequency, is the definition of the modulation transfer function. MTF is still used by optical designers as the principal criterion of image quality, although its measurement in production is less widespread than it used to be. Today it is calculated from the lens data using software such as OSLO, Zemax and Code V. 'Laserdisc and CD' optics Originally an analogue video play- back system, the Philips laserdisc format was adapted to digital in the late 1970s and was the forerunner of the CD and DVD. The digital data is encoded as a series of depressions in a reflective disc. They are arranged along a spiral path such that a laser can read them in sequence (in similar fashion to a stylus following the groove on a vinyl record). The laser must be focused onto and track this path and in addition, the reflected beam must be collected, diverted and measured. The prototype optics to achieve this was an expensive glass-lens arrangement. Hopkins was able to show, through a complete mathematical analysis of the system, that with a carefully calculated geometry, it was possible to use a single piece of transparent moulded-plastic instead. This continues to be a major factor in the low cost of laser disc- readers (such as CD players). The Hopkins Building, University of Reading On 12 June 2009 the Hopkins Building was officially opened by his son Kelvin Hopkins, the Labour MP for Luton North. This brought together under one roof, the biomedical and pharmaceutical research interests of the University. Whilst not directly involved in the applications of optics, this new facility, in its pursuance of the highest standards of teaching and research, provided an opportunity to honour one of the University's most illustrious academics.

Background Pope Victor III died on 16 September 1087 at Montecassino. Shortly before his death he recommended the election of Cardinal Odon de Lagery as his successor. Rome at that time was under control of Antipope Clement III, who was supported by the Emperor Henry IV of Germany, and there was no hope for its quick recovery.

Pietro e Cesareo there were present also the representatives of the two lower orders of cardinals, over 40 bishops and abbots, as well as Benedetto, prefect of Rome and Countess Matilda of Tuscany. The usual three days of fasting and prayer were proclaimed, and the meeting adjourned until Sunday 12 March. On that day the cardinals and the rest of the present churchmen and laymen reassembled in the same church. The Cardinal-Bishops of Albano, Tusculum and Porto together proposed the election of Odon de Lagery, Cardinal- Bishop of Ostia, who had been designated by Victor III. He accepted his election and took the name Urban II. The election was publicly announced by Cardinal Peter Igneus of Albano.

The historic district encompasses 67 buildings on across downtown Lockhart. One building included in the historic district, the Emmanuel Episcopal Church, was previously listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The historic district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 3, 1978. Courthouse The current Caldwell County Courthouse was built in 1893‚Äì1894. There is debate as to whether the design was by San Antonio architect Alfred Giles or Henri E. M. Guindon, who worked for Giles but not during the time the plans were sold to Caldwell County. The design is Second Empire-style architecture. The cornerstone was laid on August 15, 1893 and the county commissioners received the building on March 19, 1894. The walls are built of rusticated masonry and cream colored limestone and trimmed with red sandstone specified to be from Muldoon, Texas. In 1969 the building received air conditioning and had an elevator installed. Major restoration in 2000 brought the courthouse back to its historic appearance. The courthouse was rededicated in April 2000.
