A log cabin was built as the headquarters of the town company and this became known as the Washington Company House. The logs of this building were set up perpendicular, so the outside of the building resembled a stockade. One of its uses was to serve as a place of refuge when problems arose with area Indians opposed to white settlement of the area.Historical Plat Book of Washington County, Kansas (Chicago: J. S, Bird, 1882), pp. 30, 90. E. Woolbert, Sr., one of the founders of Washington, constructed a second stockade building, Woolbert's Stockade Hotel, in September 1860. It was also to be used as a place of refuge during hostilities with some area Indians. This building was Washington's first hotel and it served as the town's post office. It had walls built in stockade fashion that were six inches thick.\\"Washington County History,\\" Washington County Register, July 12, 1935, Sec. 2, p. 6.\\"The Five Court Houses Described by H. C. Robinson for Cornerstone Box,\\" Washington County Register, April 7, 1933, p. 1. If these two buildings were used, it would have occurred in 1864 or 1865. In the summer of 1864 the area between Washington and Clay Center, Kansas, was abandoned by settlers who took refuge in a stockade made of encircled wagons in Clay Center. At that time, Indians hostile to settlers were active in the area.Helen Hennon, The History of Washington (N.p.: n.d.), p. 2. Washington was not abandoned during this disturbance. The residents of Washington County and two other counties requested aid from the military, but no troops were sent. Instead, some guns and ammunition were provided by the military.Maj. Gen. James G. Blunt, report, The War of the Rebellion (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1893), Series I, Vol. XLI, Part II, p. 642.Hennon, p. 8. The use of the Stockade Hotel may have ceased when Woolbert sold the building in 1865. It also ceased at that time to be the town post office. In 1868 the building was sold to the county for use as the Washington County Courthouse. It was then called the Old Stockade Courthouse.Hennon, p. 8. Its tenure as the courthouse was short lived. On March 31, 1870, the building and all the county records burned. The origin of the fire was suspicious and the outgoing county treasurer was charged with embezzlement and arson.

While he has written extensively on such subjects as Puritanism, Herman Melville, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, he is perhaps best known for his scholarship on the work of Nathaniel Hawthorne. ;The Province of Piety In The Province of Piety, Colacurcio argues against symbolist or psychologizing interpretations and maintains that Hawthorne's fiction ought to be understood primarily as historical literature, that is, as it reflects on the moral history of his native New England. Hawthorne \\"possessed the mind of a modern intellectual historian,\\" according to Colacurcio, who compares his subject to the American historian Perry Miller: \\"For like Miller, it may be suggested, Hawthorne carried on a life-long dialectic with the historical 'thesis' of American Puritanism; it was his 'flood subject,' exercising a tyranny that bent the mind and baffled choice.\\"The Province of Piety, p. 1 And as a writer of fiction, \\"Hawthorne had a nearly flawless sense of the way some text always comes between the observer and the origins he would observe, making the historian's own tale twice-told at its very most original.\\" ;Critical reception Historian David Levin says, \\"Mr. Colacurcio's massive study, more powerfully than any other single work I know, advances our understanding of Hawthorne's development and practice as a historical writer,\\" adding: \\"Whether or not we can read Hawthorne intelligently or profitably without knowing the history of colonial New England, Mr. Colacurcio proves that we will read Hawthorne more intelligently if we take the trouble to see the range and depth of his historical judgment.\\"David Levin, \\"The Province of Historical Criticism: Historical Fact in Hawthorne and Colacurcio,\\" Early American Literature Vol. 20, No. 2 (Fall, 1985), pp. 164-172 https://www.jstor.org/stable/25056596 Literary critic Merton Sealts, Jr. notes that \\"The Province of Piety has significant interdisciplinary implications,\\" and that, \\"future critics of Hawthorne cannot ignore the impressive argument of this book.\\"Merton M.

The Dr. V.B. Gandhi Marg in Mumbai (Bombay) was named in his honour. Early life V.B. Gandhi was born on 11 November 1896 to the family of a vegetable vendor. The Gandhi family belonged to a community called \\"Konkanastha Sangameshwari Vaishya Wani Samaj\\", a group of traders from the Konkan. Vithal's father Balkrishna Gandhi was a humble vegetable vendor from Ratnagiri. V.B. Gandhi was nicknamed \\"American Gandhi\\" because he returned to India to serve the masses after receiving education abroad. Education V.B.Gandhi received his early education at Nago School based in Ratnagiri, while his family shifted to Pimpalwadi. V.B. Gandhi arrived in Mumbai in 1910 after being unable to continue his education at Nago Public school due to lack of funds. Later, he got admission to Wilson High School with sponsorship from philanthropic community elders. In 1913, Vithal completed his matriculation and secured a seat in Wilson College located on Marine Drive. Since the sponsorship did not cover college expenses, Vithal funded his college fees by tutoring other students. Later, V.B. Gandhi enrolled himself in Columbia University in 1919 for a master's degree in Economics, and completed his course in 1921. During his student days V.B.Gandhi undertook and editorial role for Young India, a journal founded by Lajpat Rai. He also wrote for \\"The Willsonian\\" his college magazine. Personal life Vithal was married to Dr. Susheela, who was his friend Dada Korgaonkar's sister. The two were introduced to each other by Dada Korgaonkar himself, and though Vithal was rejected by Susheela at first; they subsequently decided to marry each other in December 1929. Vithal and Susheela were parents to two children, son Arvind who was born in 1930 and daughter Leela who was born in 1933. Arvind Gandhi married Dr. Pamila and were parents of three daughters Leena Tewari, Sheela and Sunita. Leela Gandhi, Vithal's daughter married Vijay Gad, and they had a daughter, Beena. In subsequent years, the Gandhi family's grandchildren married into different families; Leena Gandhi married Prashant Tewari, Sheela Gandhi married Keshav Rao and Sunita married Kartik Mani. The only daughter of Leela Gandhi and her husband Vijay Gad, Beena tied the knot with Ulhas Yargop. V.B. Gandhi was a huge admirer of the pipe and was well versed on the subject. Vithal developed a great liking for the pipe as he saw it as a symbol of \\"democracy\\". He opined that the pipe was not only for the affluent but for all, as the pipe would pass from hand to hand without discriminating on any basis. V.B. Gandhi had a very liberal view regarding the education of his children however; he was strictly in favour of his children being schooled in their mother tongue. He was highly supportive of his wife's career and encouraged her to pursue a career as a doctor. Vithal was known for his honesty and fair dealings. He was sent a watch, by his American creditors, as a mark of appreciation for his ethical conduct when he repaid each and every penny in spite of the Great Depression and misappropriation of funds within his own company. The watch had the names of each and every presenter etched on it, and was worn by Vithal all through his life like a badge. Vithal's work with the mill workers and other slum dwellers made him realise the importance of medicine and he made every effort through his business, to bring as many possible drugs to India in order to reduce rampant disease. During the late 1960s V.B. Gandhi's health began to deteriorate and was troubled by High Blood pressure with sporadic attacks of Angina. In June 1967, Vithal was to undergo a prostate gland operation but picked up an infection before the slated surgery. He also developed a rare skin condition, pemphigus, which gradually spread to his lungs developing pneumonia. V.B. Gandhi died on 3 November 1969 at the age of 73. Association with Amrit Rai and Lala Lajpat Rai Chowpatty Beach became a hub of revolutionary meetings and ideas. Vithal Balkrishna Gandhi and his friends attended many such meetings. Vithal was affected by the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi, Lalalajpat Rai and other leaders. He had observed Lala Lajpat Rai from close quarters during his education years in the US when he served as a waiter at a restaurant which was frequented by Lala Lajpat Rai. Later when his son, Amrit Rai enrolled himself for a course in the U.S.A. he shared the apartment with Vithal and was readily accepted Lajpat Rai. Since then, V.B. Gandhi and Amrit Rai were nicknamed \\"The Inseparables\\" by other students as they often spent a lot of time together exploring the new campus. Career V.B. Gandhi's initial business venture was an investment he made along with his friend, Shantilal Parekh, in the business of cashew imports which wiped out his entire savings and forced him to return to India. On his return, he began working as a professor at Wilson College. During the same time he continued his association with his friend Shantilal Parekh, and together they managed to secure contracts for trade in medical products and radio accessories. Due to expanding business the need to source more funds forced Vithal to travel overseas and raise necessary capital. Vithal and Parekh got their venture incorporated and named it \\"American Products Company Ltd.\\". This was one of the first corporations of India. Vithal travelled to the US for sourcing business for a period of one year and on his return he found misappropriation of company funds by Parekh. Parekh was made to exit the company and Vithal took the reins of the corporation into his own hands and paid of American creditors in the years to come. The company continued to grow and in 1932 acquired the agency for Atomidine from Dr. Sunker Bhisey. In 1933 many more agencies were acquired. Vithal began to connect with other corporations to add to the list of agencies to his company. USV&P; Inc. welcomed his queries and registered in India considerable number of patents including special medications for diabetes which were imported by American Products Company Ltd. With this V.B. Gandhi became the pioneer in India in field of unique pharmaceutical products. In 1942, V.B. Gandhi became a member of the Indian Merchants Chamber. Soon after India achieved independence and V.B. Gandhi had helped in setting up a sound state transport system, his business began to focus on pharmaceuticals. In 1947, due to import restrictions and tight currency conversion norms, V.B. Gandhi requested USV&P; Inc. to permit the manufacture of some of their products in India, which was however rejected at the time. The focus on pharmaceuticals had begun to emerge shaping the future of the company. Vithal's son Arvind joined his father in business in 1952. USV&P; Inc. had proposed to send bulk containers of their medications to India, which would be packed into smaller packs by American Products Company Ltd. Later after much persuasion USV&P; agreed to transfer technology for manufacturing to India. Gradually, Vithal and Arvind Gandhi established a manufacturing unit to manufacture USV&P; Inc.‚Äôs products in India. On 1960, U.S. Vitamins & Pharmaceutical Corporation (India) Ltd. was incorporated with equal share holding between USV&P; and the Gandhi family. V.B. Gandhi handed over the reins of the business to Arvind Gandhi in the year 1960. Political career and contribution V.B. Gandhi had been an admirer of Lala Lajpat Rai and Mahatma Gandhi, but he found his loyalties divided when Rai decided to break away from the Congress Party. During the same time, the mill worker‚Äôs condition had grabbed his attention and he continued his social work in this direction. In recognition of his social involvement with the workers, V.B. Gandhi was given and honorary title in the Congress Party of \\"Dr. V.B. Gandhi\\" by S.K. Patil, the chairperson of Bombay Provincial Congress Committee. He was an integral part of all the major nationalist movements by the Congress party during this time. Vithal was praised by Mahatma Gandhi for his active involvement with the mill workers association. In 1938, V.B. Gandhi was offered a ticket for the BMC elections which he accepted. Vithal won the BMC elections in 1939. For the next 12 years, he managed his corporation and his political roles. Vithal served three terms at the BMC and of these three; twice he also chaired the committees. Outside the BMC, V.B. Gandhi chaired the committee for Public Transportation, was a member on the BEST and was the chairman of the Sewri Cotton Kamgar Union. Vithal became extremely active in the Indian freedom struggle and continued to remain absent from the BMC meetings citing medical reasons as he was completely involved in the freedom movement and the secret meetings. Vithal helped communicate Mahatma Gandhi's message among the masses and opposed Jinnah's theory of a separate nation for the Muslim population. Vithal was an advocate of encouraging foreign capital in India. Later, V.B. Gandhi aligned with Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti against the Congress party which demanded retaining Bombay in the state of Maharashtra. Vithal always upheld the fact that he was not against the Congress party, it was only that he had a different view on the matter of state reorganisation. Later during the second Lok Sabha elections, V.B. Gandhi, though an extremely strong candidate, politely turned down the ticket. On completing his assignment with the Public Accounts Committee, Vithal became a member of the Central Pay Commission. Vithal was offered a ticket to the elections to the third Parliament, which he accepted. He was joined by is nephew Vasant Todkari. Vithal was representing the Congress party and emerged victorious. The third Parliament witnessed landmark events such as the demise of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the rise of his daughter Indira Gandhi to the post of party president, war with Pakistan, Taskent agreement and the sudden demise of Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. Vithal was often referred to as the \\"Gandhi from Ratnagiri\\" and was promised a seat in the Rajya Sabha by Pandit Jawahrlal Nehru. The promise was later honoured by Mrs Indira Gandhi. However, Vithal refused the seat due to deteriorating health. He had completed is term in the Lok Sabha and strongly disapproved of the growing infighting within the Congress party. Contribution to Mumbai (Bombay) In the subsequent years of the BMC, V.B. Gandhi was actively involved in many projects as a municipal corporator. His major contributions were towards Vaitarna Dam, the takeover of BEST from the British and the execution of the State Transport networks. Vithal realised the importance of good transport for the common man and was instrumental in the take-over of BEST from the British in 1948. A statutory body of nine persons was appointed, of which Vithal was one, to manage the affairs of the BEST. Analysing the problems of Sewri, Vithals‚Äô own constituency, where workers had no mode of transport to return to their villages, he proposed a well-researched and detailed network for state transportation. The recommendations were eventually incorporated and the State Transport buses were launched. Vithal was appointed Chairman of the Regional Transport Authority. His contribution to the transport system received praise from the state and central leaders. In 1951, V.B. Gandhi became the unanimous choice for the Bombay mayor and was to succeed S.K. Patil who had held the office for the past two terms and was keen on a third. He requested Vithal to relinquish the offer which he gracefully accepted and turned down the offer to become Bombay's‚Äô new Mayor. In lieu of this S.K. Patil had promised Vithal a ticket to contest the Lok Sabha election in 1952. Vithal was to contest elections from Bombay city, North. The region was a strong communist foothold and Vithal's victory came as a pleasant surprise to the entire party. V.B. Gandhi was a senior member of the Indian delegation for E.C.A.F.E. (Economic Conference for Asia and the Far East). It was Vithal who suggested that the Indian Taxi's should sport the colours of black and yellow so that people could easily identify them, the idea appealed to Jawaharlal Nehru and was put into effect. V.B. Gandhi was a respected Parliamentarian and was a regular invitee to Jawaharlal Nehru's birthday hosted at Teen Murti. Biographical Works V.B Gandhi's 2013 biography was written by his granddaughter, Leena Gandhi Tewari, and titled Beyond Pipes and Dreams.

According to a 2009 survey conducted under the auspices of the Philippines' Department of Health, Philippine Statistics Authority, the World Health Organization, and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 28.3 percent of the population are \\"current tobacco smokers\\". This figures represents 17.3 million of 61.3 million adult Filipinos. The Philippines was the 15th largest consumer of tobacco in the world in 2002 and currently has one of the highest smoking rates in Asia, as well as some of the lowest cigarette prices. It is home to several major cigarette and cigar manufacturers, including one owned by Philip Morris International. The Philippines ranks second in number of smokers, and has the highest number of female smokers in the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The World Health Organization estimates that 10 Filipinos die every hour due to cancer, stroke, lung and heart diseases brought on by cigarette smoking. The Philippines is a party to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. This caused concern for the World Health Organization when the Philippines hosted one of the world's largest tobacco trade shows, ProTobEx Asia, in 2012 and 2013. History In this illustration from the 1734 Carta Hydrographica y Chorographica de las Yslas Filipinas, an Armenian is seen smoking from a hookah as two Indian men look on Smoking the family cigar, Northern Luzon, 1912 Tobacco was introduced in the Philippines in the late 16th century during the era of Spanish colonization when the Augustinians brought cigar tobacco seeds to the colony for cultivation. In 1686, William Dampier visited Mindanao and observed that smoking was a widespread custom. It had also become an article of foreign trade with the Dutch from Tidore and Ternate buying rice, beeswax and tobacco from the Spanish colony. =Tobacco monopoly= The tobacco monopoly in the Philippine islands during the Spanish era was established by Governor-General Jos√© Basco y Vargas on March 1, 1782 with the aim of increasing government revenue. Spearheaded by the Sociedad Econ√≥mica de los Amigos del Pa√≠s (Economic Societies of Friends of the Country), tobacco was cultivated under strict government control confined to the Cagayan Valley, the Ilocos provinces, Nueva Ecija and Marinduque. The tobacco farmers were given quotas each year and the entire crop was then bought by the government. The tobacco leaves were then brought to Manila and made into cigars and cigarettes in government-owned factories, later to be shipped out for export. Tobacco became a major commodity in the galleon trade. The tobacco monopoly made the colony self-sustaining and profit-earning. In 1808, the government realized a net profit of P500,000.00. These profits increased in subsequent years, reaching $3,000,000 in 1881. As a consequence of the monopoly, the Philippines became the biggest tobacco-producing country in Asia. However, it led to abuses by government officials who wanted to enrich themselves. The farmers abhorred the crop as they were at the mercy of government agents who cheated on its price, and they did not have the liberty to raise other crops for themselves and their families. The monopoly also encouraged bribery and smuggling due to the desire to evade strict government regulations. The tobacco monopoly was abolished in 1882. Legislation Tobacco packaging warning messages on cigarette packs sold in the Philippines prior to March 2016 Graphic tobacco packaging warning messages prior to 2018 revision Republic Act No. 9211, otherwise known as the \\"Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003\\", makes it unlawful for any person under the age of 18 years to purchase, sell or smoke tobacco products. Yet a survey conducted by the Department of Health revealed that children as young as five years old are already starting to smoke. The Tobacco Regulation Act also implements certain restrictions and bans on tobacco- related advertisements, endorsements, sponsorships and packaging. The Tobacco Regulation Act only requires text health warnings, despite the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control treaty which was adopted in May 2003 and of which the Philippines is a signatory. In 2010, the Department of Health issued an administrative order requiring the inclusion of graphic warning labels on packs and prohibiting the use of misleading descriptors such as \\"mild\\" and \\"light\\" on tobacco product packaging and labels pursuant to Article 11 of the WHO FCTC. In response, the tobacco companies filed five cases against the Department of Health questioning its authority. In June 2014, a legislative committee composed of senators and congressmen passed a bill, called \\"The Graphic Health Warnings Law\\", compelling cigarette manufacturers to print pictures and illustrations that warn about the dangers of smoking on cigarette packs. The images would occupy the lower half of the front and rear panels of a cigarette pack and could include pictures of cancerous lungs and throats. Due to persistent instances of tobacco industry interference, it took more than a year before the law's implementing rules and regulations were finalized by the Inter-Agency Committee on Tobacco (IAC-T), of which the Philippine Tobacco Institute was a member. In March 2016, implementation of the Graphic Health Warning Law came into effect requiring tobacco companies to print twelve graphic health warning templates on cigarette packages being sold in the country. The law's implementing rules and regulations call for all cigarette packages being sold in the market to have graphic warnings that cover the lower half of the pack by November 2016. Smoking ban The Tobacco Regulation Act bans smoking in public places such as schools and recreational facilities, elevators and stairwells, hospitals, nursing homes, laboratories, public conveyances and public facilities such as airports and ship terminals, train and bus stations, restaurants and conference halls, with the exception of separate smoking rooms. On May 16, 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte issued Executive Order 26 reinforcing the tobacco regulation law. Statistics The Filipinos' preferred tobacco product is the cigarette, the most popular brand being Marlboro. It is estimated that each adult smoker consumes 838 cigarettes, equating to about 42 cigarette packs, per year. There are 17.3 million Filipino adult smokers (15 years or older), 48 percent (14.6 million) of which are males and 9 percent (2.8 million) are females. In addition, 23 percent of Filipino adults are daily tobacco smokers; 38.2 percent for males, who on the average smoked 11 cigarettes a day, and 6.9 percent for females, who on average smoked 7 cigarettes per day. Nearly half (48 percent) of the adult smokers had made an attempt to quit, however, only 5 percent were successful. Second-hand tobacco smoke is also a concern. More than half (55 percent) of adults who use public transportation are exposed to it; in workplaces with no anti-smoking policy, more than 75 percent of workers are exposed. A survey conducted by the Department of Health in 2007 determined that 1 in 5 Filipino students is a cigarette smoker. Exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke was also high, with 7 in 10 exposed to second-hand smoke around other people outside the home. In addition, more than half of the students had a parent who was a smoker. According to a 2016 report, 200 Filipinos die every day due to smoking-related diseases.

The term is used almost exclusively when referring to strains of corn, and especially refers to the crossing of genetically modified crops with those that are not. For example, farmers who grow specialty crops may wish to preserve their genetic traits, such as an especially high oil content, without compromising the gene pool of the variety. Or, farmers may wish to avoid crossing a particular GMO crop that has been approved for export to a certain country, with non-GMO crops or other varieties of GMO crops that may not have the same approval. Farmers who produce non-GMO crops and farmers who produce GMO crops for export are the most likely to be affected. Farmers whose non-GMO crops have been contaminated with GMO genes may lose their contracts or the rights to certain labeling. GMO exporters must meet the requirements of other countries, many of whom have stringent import controls regarding GMOs. Pollen drift can be avoided by careful examination of the geography of the area where the crop is to be grown combined with the study of the nature of the crop's pollen, the distance it can travel and via what methods, and how to plant their fields to avoid unwanted cross-pollination. Corn Corn pollen is particularly prone to pollen drift. Corn plants release their pollen for around a week, and an entire field may take up to two weeks to completely release its pollen; pollen release usually shows a spike two to three days after half the plants have released their pollen. Each individual plant can produce 4 to 5 million individual pollen grains. Its pollen is among the largest particles that can be found in the air, and is spherical in its shape. It can drift up to half a mile and remain viable for several days in optimal conditions. These factors all create a considerable possibility for one corn field to cross-pollinate another, even if just a small percentage of the pollen shed by a given field drifts into a different field. Corn producers can reduce the chance of cross-contamination via pollen drift by separating fields by at least ; however, many identity preserved corn programs require that non- GMO fields be separated from GMO corn by a distance of at least . They may also utilize a technique called 'flooding' by surrounding their fields with a border of non-GMO corn, the theory being that these 'border rows' of corn will dilute any outside pollen, thus reducing the risk of cross-contamination. Producers can also alternate planting dates to prevent crops from releasing their pollen at similar times.

The first hurricane was first observed over the northwestern Caribbean Sea on June 12\\\\. The sixth and final storm was last noted on October 26\\\\. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. Three tropical cyclones during the season existed simultaneously. Two of the cyclones have only a single known point in its track due to a sparsity of data. Operationally, another tropical cyclone was believed to have existed over the eastern Atlantic between September 17 and September 18, but HURDAT - the official Atlantic hurricane database - excludes this system. However, in the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only cyclones that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea are currently known, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to four tropical cyclones per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated. Of the six known 1858 Atlantic cyclones, five were first documented in 1995 by Jose Fernandez- Partagas and Henry Diaz. The first system was spotted over the western Caribbean Sea on June 12\\\\. It had a single-point track. Another tropical cyclone was first observed over the northern Atlantic Ocean on August 5 and also had a single-point track. On September 14, the next system was observed over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Several hours later, the storm struck Florida, causing severe damage to crops. Strong winds and rough seas were reported by ships and on land, particularly in Maine. The storm dissipated on September 17\\\\. That same day, another tropical cyclone developed over the central Atlantic. The storm capsized the bark Phantom, though no one drowned. The next hurricane developed over the Bahamas on September 22, but caused little damage, despite its proximity to land. On October 21, the sixth and final system of the season was first observed over the Bahamas. The storm brought coastal flooding to Nassau and Bermuda later in its duration, before dissipating on October 26\\\\.

H. Sampson encountered a hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. The vessel suffered some damage. The storm was a Category 1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale, based on winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) observed by the L. H. Sampson. =Hurricane Two= A Category 1 hurricane was first observed about 585 mi (940 km) west-northwest of Corvo Island in the Azores on August 5, based on reports from two ships, the Shelter and the A.Z.Greenland. Another ship that encountered the storm, the Magistrate, was abandoned. =Hurricane Three= The bark Cavallo encountered experienced severe weather in the eastern Gulf of Mexico between September 13 and September 15\\\\. It is believed that a tropical storm developed on September 14. Moving northeastward, the storm made landfall near modern-day Palmetto, Florida at 15:00 UTC, with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). While crossing the state, the storm brought severe damage. Ships remained in port at river ports in the state and at St. Marys, Georgia. After emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near Oak Hill, Florida early on September 15, the system reached hurricane status several hours later. Shortly thereafter, the storm intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, peaking with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). On September 16, the hurricane passed offshore North Carolina and then weakened to a Category 1 hurricane while east of the Mid-Atlantic states. At 17:00 UTC on September 16, the storm made landfall near East Hampton, New York with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). About an hour later, it struck again just west of Groton, Connecticut with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). Early on September 17, the system weakened to a tropical storm and dissipated over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence several hours later. Parts of this storm were first described by David M. Ludlum, who called it The New England Tropical Storm of 1858. However, barometer readings taken at Sag Harbor, New York and Providence, Rhode Island, along with ship reports and wind speeds recorded at Bangor, Maine and Nantucket, Massachusetts, conclude that the system reached hurricane intensity. In Maine, strong gales occurred, with Bangor reported having \\"one of the heaviest in years.\\" Trees and chimneys toppled throughout the southeastern portions of the state. There was also minor damage to shipping in Belfast. =Hurricane Four= On September 17, a hurricane was observed in the mid-Atlantic by the bark Phantom. Later that day, the Phantom sank, though all of the crew survived. They described the system as a 'perfect hurricane' with a lull around midnight on September 17 before the wind changed direction and blew with even greater force than before. The hurricane continued travelling on a northwest track and between September 22 and the night of September 23 it was encountered by the Hudson, the City of Washington and the bark Lanark. The system weakened to a tropical storm early on September 24 and dissipated later that day about 610 mi (980 km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Until reanalysis, this storm was considered two separate systems, including in the 1995 study by Partagas and Diaz. However, they stated that further information could indicate a single storm. =Hurricane Five= Based on reports from the bark Wh H. Chandler, a tropical storm developed in the Bahamas near Acklins on September 22. Moving northward, the storm strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane by 12:00 UTC the next day. Later on September 23, the Harkaway noted a \\"severe hurricane\\" at Bermuda, though the report was considered \\"doubtful\\" due to the storm's distance from the island. The hurricane continued northward and was last noted about east of Virginia on September 25, after the Priscilla observed sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). =Hurricane Six= The final known tropical cyclone of the season was first observed by the brig Sea Lark on October 21, while located just north of Inagua in the Bahamas. Throughout the Bahamas, storm surge impacted some islands. At Nassau, several ships were driven ashore, parts of the town were flooded and buildings along the shoreline suffered damage. The storm moved northeastward and strengthened into a hurricane at 12:00 UTC on October 22\\\\. About 24 hours later, the hurricane deepened into a Category 2 hurricane. Later on October 23, it passed just west of Bermuda. Gale force winds and rough seas were observed on the island, causing damage to several vessels. Peaking with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), the storm began to weaken, falling to Category 1 intensity on October 25\\\\. It weakened to a tropical storm early the following day and dissipated hours later, while located about 195 mi (315 km) east-southeast of Sable Island.

This was Ghosh's last full-length film as a director. Indian film director Sujoy Ghosh portrayed the character Byomkesh Bakshi in this film.  Plot  Maharaja Arunangshu, the ruler of a princely state named Balabantpur, had made a wish list on his death bed in the presence of Dewan Chandrashekhar, the family physician Kaligati and the High Priest. It laid down certain conditions under which his son Himangshu could inherit the kingdom. The first condition forbade Himangshu to marry a non-Hindu girl, and the second demanded a legitimate heir within three years of his marriage. Bound by his father's conditions of succession, Himangshu is compelled to marry Alaka, an aspiring actress. A year and half into the marriage, Harinath, the young palace librarian, who is friendly with Alaka, disappears without any trace. This mystery occasions the arrival of the sleuth Byomkesh and his author friend Ajit to Balabantpur. The visit, however, is under the pretext of an invitation to take part in a hunting expedition. In the course of their stay, they unravel many secrets involving the residents of the palace and also about the topography of Balabantpur. Byomkesh is particularly intrigued by the character of Kaligati, the royal physician, and uncovers several clues which connect Kaligati with the disappearance of Harinath. It is discovered that Alaka is sexually frigid. But she was anxious to continue the bloodline of Himangshu. Not getting any sexual pleasure from his wife, Himangshu was attracted towards Leela, the daughter of Kaligati. On a previous hunting expedition Alaka had sent Leela with Himanghshu instead of herself accompanying him. Thus Leela became pregnant with his child. But Harinath the librarian loved Leela and wanted to marry her despite knowing she was carrying Himangshu's child. Kaligati found this inconvenient as Leela's son would then be officially known as Harinath's son and not Himangshu's. Kaligati wanted to be the grandfather of the royal offspring. Thus he orchestrated Harinath's drowning in quicksand on the night when he discovered Harinath had married Leela. The ensuing story revolves around the detective's unveiling of Kaligati as the culprit behind the mystery of Balabantpur.

Business As a youth, the younger Dreyfus made frequent trips to nearby Basel, Switzerland, delivering grain for sale from the family farm. In 1851, he began trading wheat from neighbouring farms. He founded a company under his father's name, as he was too young to use his own.Louis Dreyfus Commodities website: \\"Key eras in our history\\" retrieved 16 August 2013 The younger Dreyfus later changed his surname to Louis-Dreyfus, but kept the company name without the hyphen. In 1858, after rapid growth, he moved the company to Berne, Switzerland, where it expanded its operations throughout Europe by purchasing grain from the \\"breadbaskets\\" of Eastern Europe and transporting it to the hungry markets in Western Europe. In 1864, the company moved to Zurich, Switzerland and in 1872, after the Franco-Prussian War when France ceded Alsace to Germany, Louis Dreyfus chose French citizenship. He moved to the shipping port of Marseille and by 1875 had moved his company's headquarters to Paris. The development of a transcontinental railroad in Europe combined with a more reliable shipping network and better access to market information ‚Äì after the development of the telegraph and telephone ‚Äì enabled the Louis Dreyfus Group to grow rapidly via arbitrage: the taking advantage of price differentials between locations. In 1883, the Louis Dreyfus Group was one of the first companies to engage in futures trading at the Liverpool Corn Trade Association, allowing it to both buy and sell commodities simultaneously. By 1900, the Louis Dreyfus Group was the world's largest grain trader. In 1905, the Banque Louis-Dreyfus was founded to help finance the company's operations in grain markets.Swiss Center.

In gratitude, Theodore vowed to become a novice at the Kiev Lavra. This he fulfilled in 1894. When Bishop Nicholas (Ziorov) of the North American diocese visited the Lavra to recruit workers for his mission, Theodore was invited to America. He was assigned as the secretary of the mission administration after arriving in San Francisco in late 1894. Soon after he met and married Ella Dabovich from the Serbian community. She was the niece of Fr. Sebastian Dabovich. Then, on December 4, 1897, he was ordained a priest following his earlier ordination as deacon. On June 20, 1900, his wife delivered him a son, Boris, who would be remembered during World War II as Colonel Boris Pash, the leader of the Alsos Mission in Europe under the Manhattan Project and as the Foreign Liaison Officer under General Douglas MacArthur during negotiations on the future of the Japanese Orthodox Church in 1945‚Äì1947. When Archbishop Tikhon (Bellavin) returned to Russia in 1906, Fr. Theodore accompanied him with his family and worked in the administration of the Warsaw-Vilna Diocese. During World War I, Fr. Theodore worked in the Famine Relief Program of the YMCA on the Volga River. In 1917 his wife died. As the chaos of the Bolshevik regime settled over the Church, he met often with and was advised and instructed by Patriarch Tikhon on the future of the North American diocese. During these meetings Patriarch Tikhon also expressed the desire that Fr. Theodore become a bishop. Fr. Theodore returned to the United States in 1922 and was soon tonsured a monk with the name of Theophilus. Then, under direction of the Holy Synod Hieromonk Theophilius was consecrated on December 3, 1922, as Bishop of Chicago. He oversaw the restart of theological education in the diocese that had ended with the closing, in 1924, of the seminary at Tenafly, New Jersey. Bp. Theophilius remained in Chicago until he was transferred in 1931, to become Bishop of San Francisco. After death of Metropolitan Platon (Rozhdestvensky) in 1934, Bishop Theophilius was elected jointly by the council of assembled bishops and the full Council as the new metropolitan by the Fifth All-American Sobor that convened in Cleveland, Ohio, on November 20, 1934. Under Metr. Theophilius American Church continued to journey into a state of stability. Episcopal relationships improved as the threat of the Living Church subsided, although new challenges arose. He took a course to unity of Russian church diaspora: in 1935, he signed the \\"Provisional Regulations on the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad\\" (–í—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ü–æ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ –†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–π –ü—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–π –¶–µ—Ä–∫–≤–∏ –∑–∞–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–µ–π), which led the Northern-American Metropolia came under the authority of the Synod of Bishops in Sremski Karlovci, but for all that metropolia, headed by Metropolitan Theophilus retained considerable autonomy. Attention was given to improving church education programs, including establishing Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary. A metropolitan cathedral, the Holy Virgin Protection Cathedral, in New York City, was acquired. However, the unity with the Russian Orthodox Church was fragile. On 26‚Äì29 November 1946, Cleveland Council adopted a resolution to quit over the Synod of Russian Orthodox Church Abroad. In the words of Archbishop Vitaly (Maksimenko), Metropolitan Theophilus did not sympathize the decision to sever ties with the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, but submit to the decision of the Council.–ê—Ä—Ö—ñ–µ–ø–∏—Å–∫–æ–ø—ä –í–∏—Ç–∞–ª—ñ–π (–ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º–µ–Ω–∫–æ). –ü–∞–º—è—Ç–∏ –ú–∏—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∞ —≤–µ–æ—Ñ–∏–ª–∞.

The main finding of the investigation was that there was no evidence the schools had received unauthorised prior warning. There was a secondary finding that the trust's Chief Executive, Dame Rachel de Souza, had mistakenly seen a planned inspection date for one of the schools during her own training as an inspector; however, this date had been changed as a result. There was further concern about Ofsted's judgements of one of the trust's schools in 2018. In 2015 a local Member of Parliament, Clive Lewis, questioned the Trust's fitness to run schools. In 2018 there was concern about Sir Theodore's continuing role in the trust given that he had become Academies Minister, although he was no longer \\"a person of significant control\\". He resigned from the trust the same year. In the same year there was criticism of Dame Rachel de Souza's salary. In 2019 there was publicity about the amount the trust was deducting from schools' budgets to fund development of the curriculum. In summer 2020, de Souza took a high profile decision to reopen her schools in mid August in response to the educational time lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic. > ‚ÄúEvery hour makes a difference!

Early history The plot of land where the temple is situated was once part of a forest, a tranquil area surrounded by a thick growth of trees, plants and creepers. On the northwest corner of the plot there existed a small deep pond known as Bhoothakulam. People living in the area believed it was a shelter for poisonous snakes. On the eastern side there was a huge extensive deep pond. During days of rain, a stream originated from there making the surrounding area fertile and cultivable. As this place was full of grass and pure water, the cow-herders from the neighbouring area would congregate there with their cattle. =Legend= According to the legend, a group of cow-herders got a coconut from this place. They found a stone on the southern part of Bhoothakulam. When they hit the coconut on the stone (intending to remove the husk), they found drops of blood dripping from the stone. They explained the phenomena to the elders. The astrologer suggested that the stone contained supernatural powers and poojas should be started immediately after constructing a temple. The elders and cow-herders constructed a temporary temple using poles, leaves and tender leaves of coconut palm. It was a custom in ancient days that balikas used to prepare flower garlands, lit the pooja lamps in ancient Kudumba temples. Accepting this tradition, the cow-herders wearing female attire, offered poojas in the temple. The milky liquid prepared from coconut kernel was boiled, the medicinal oil (Urukku Velichenna) extracted and solid substance taken (Kottan) was offered to the goddess as Naivedyam. Festivals =Chamayavilakku= The Kottankulangara Festival (or Kottankulangara Chamayavilakku) is held annually at the temple in which men from across the state and now even outside it dress in female attire. The cross-dressing is part of traditional ritual festivities and at night they hold traditional lamps and walk in procession to the temple to the accompaniment of a traditional orchestra. Devotees visit the temple to seek the blessings of the goddess. =Kuruthola Pandal= To commemorate the legend and origin of the temple, the model of the ancient temple is being constructed every year. The devotees stand long lines from Kunjalummoodu to Arattukadavu at the time of the Devi's journey from Kunjalummoodu. =Jeevatha Ezhunnallathu= Jeevatha Ezunnallathu is mostly performed in Devi temples. Wearing the traditional dress (\\"Thattudukkal\\") and with towels firmly tied at the waist and on the head, they carry the Jeevatha on their shoulders and perform the step-dance.

It was enlarged three times, the final time being in 1857.St. Mary's, Lowe House Diamond Jubilee Commemorative Brochure 1989 p.3 =Foundation= To accommodate the growing Catholic population in the town, a new church was built in 1924 by the side of the original church (which was eventually demolished in 1930). The foundation stone was laid by the Archbishop of Liverpool, Frederick Keating on 11 May 1924. The scale was decided on by Fr Reginald Riley SJ, who wanted a larger size church for the local Catholic community. He was parish priest at the church from 1912 to 1946. The church was opened three years later, in 1929, and was designed by Charles B. Powell, an Irish architect who did other architectural work for the Jesuits in Dublin. It is colloquially referred to as 'The Basilica of St Helens' and 'The Poor Man's Cathedral' by people in St Helens, because construction of the church was funded by donations from the local population during a time of economic struggle. The dome, designed in a Romanesque crossed with Gothic style, is on the point where the nave, sanctuary and transepts meet, sitting on a castellated octagonal tower. There is a copper cross on the dome that is 16 feet high. It was given to the church by the family of a local builder, James Yearsley whose company helped lay the foundations. The clock face on the 130 ft tall tower is set in gold mosaic. =Carillon= A major feature of the clock tower is the historic Carillon (bells playable in musical notation by a keyboard, rather than in sequences by ropes). Cast and built by renowned bellfounders John Taylor & Co. of Loughborough, it is the largest in the North West of England housing 47 bells. The Carillon is regularly played and there are also occasional recitals by visiting Carillonneurs. Parish Every week, the church has two Masses every Sunday, one at 11:00 am and the other at 4:30 pm. Also, there are Masses at 9:15 am on Tuesdays and Thursdays. On 27 July 1980, the head of the Jesuits in Britain announced to the congregation that, as of Easter 1981, the church would no longer be staffed by Jesuits and would be handed over to the Archdiocese of Liverpool. In 2010, the parish was merged with the nearby Holy Cross and St Helen parish in the centre of St Helens to become the parish of Holy Cross and St Mary. However in 2014, following changes in the archdiocese, St Mary's Lowe House was paired with the parish of St Thomas of Canterbury, Dentons Green. The church of Holy Cross & St. Helen reverted to a single parish under a new parish priest.

Credited with developing an early machine gun, he disappeared from his home in Southampton in the 1880s. While trying to find Cantelo, his two sons saw a photograph of American-born inventor Hiram Maxim (born 1840), creator of the Maxim gun; his superficial similarity to their father led them to believe that he had re- emerged under a new name. Background Arundel Tower in Southampton, against which used to be Cantelo's home, Old Tower Inn Cantelo was born in 1839 at Newport on the Isle of Wight. He was an engineer who, in the 1870s, owned a shop on French Street in Southampton and a yard in Northam, employing up to 40 people. He was also the landlord of the Old Tower Inn at the end of Bargate Street which derived its name from the Arundel Tower against which it was built. Beneath the pub was a tunnel where Cantelo spent much of his time, turning it into an underground workshop. Cantelo was married with three children ‚Äì a daughter and two sons. He was a keen musician and the bandmaster of the old 2nd Hampshires. Invention The development of new, rapid-firing guns was becoming a hotly contested area for inventors. The military of countries across the world were looking to secure the most powerful weapons, and there was great potential for an inventor to secure a highly profitable government contract. Machine guns were first used during the American Civil War, and the Gatling gun, Nordenfelt gun, and Gardner gun had all started gaining popularity. Cantelo wanted his own stake in the revolution. Cantelo used the tunnel underneath the Old Tower Inn for his experiments and was later joined by his two sons, both engineers themselves. Locals reported hearing noises coming from the vicinity, but the family kept their work a closely guarded secret. In the early 1880s Cantelo announced the gun's completion to his family. Disappearance Accounts differ regarding the nature of Cantelo's disappearance. Some reports say that he went for an extended holiday as a reward for his hard work or might have gone off to sell his finished invention. It is also claimed that a large sum of Cantelo's money had been transferred out of his bank account after his disappearance. Cantelo's family tried to find William, but with no real success. They employed a private investigator, who traced him to America but could not find out anything more.  Subsequent rumours and speculations  An 1895 Maxim gun. Photo: Max Smith An American inventor, Hiram Maxim, had moved to London and perfected a rapid- fire machine gun. Cantelo's two sons happened across a photograph of Maxim, whose similarity to their father led them to believe that he was still alive and had assumed a new identity. Descriptions of the gun sounded similar to the one they had worked on. The sons tried to challenge Maxim, but he wanted nothing to do with them. He sold the Maxim gun to the British government. The name \\"Maxim\\", the family claimed, was evidence that Cantelo had assumed this new identity. Fond of maxims, Cantelo often carried a book of such phrases in his pocket. Two witnesses also claim that Cantelo referred to his invention as \\"my maxim gun\\". The family's belief that Cantelo re-emerged under a new identity is inconsistent with accounts of Maxim's early life. Born in 1840, Maxim became a carriage maker's apprentice at the age of 14. He developed an interest in inventions and obtained 271 patents, the first of which came in 1866. An episode of Punt PI, a BBC Radio 4 series, covered the Cantelo story with Steve Punt investigating Cantelo's disappearance. He discovered that Maxim had complained about a man who was impersonating him in the United States. He also showed a photograph of Cantelo next to his machine gun to the Royal Armouries, who stated that the weapon appeared to be the same as the Maxim gun. A facial expert who compared the images of Cantelo and Maxim highlighted that there were visible differences between the two men. Punt cast doubt on the idea that Cantelo and Maxim were the same person but noted the coincidences.

Background Bai Fangli was born in Hebei and lived with his wife, and his daughter, Bai Jinfeng. Charity work In 1986‚Äì1987, at the age of 74, Bai retired from his pedicab driving job and returned to his hometown in Hebei Province where he decided to live the rest of his life. On his way back, he witnessed many children working in the field. Upon learning that they had to drop out of school due to financial difficulties he decided to go back to his job of driving a pedicab in Tianjin to support the children in receiving education. However, before returning to work he first donated 5,000 yuan (US$785 in 2015) for the cause of their fees. Hitherto 2001, he often worked for long shifts, sometimes 24 hours at a stretch so that he could make the money to pay the installment for the school fee. He got an accommodation close to the railway and would wait 24 hours a day, eat simple food and wore second hand discarded clothes. He also lived in a shabby house in the outskirts of Tianjin and ate humble food, according to local media. In 1996, he opened a small store near Tianjin's railway station to make more money. Most of his income was donated to local schools and universities such as to the Nankai University where he donated 35,000 yuan (US$5,498 in 2015) for the first time in 1996. His entire contribution summed up to 350,000 yuan. In 2001, at the age of nearly 90, he paid his last installment to the Yaohua High School and retired from his job. Illness and death In May 2005, Bai was sent to a hospital, where he was found to have lung cancer. He had been in a deep coma for about 20 days prior. His health eventually worsened and he died in that same year at the age of 92. Legacy Due to his tremendous amount of contribution to society, Bai has since been held in high-esteem and respected by many. In 2004, he was chosen by China Central Television (CCTV) as one of the 20 candidates for the \\"10 people who touched China's heart\\" selection. After hearing that Bai was seriously ill, Nankai University students folded 99 paper cranes in early September 2005 to pray for him.

The oldest parts of the church date from the last quarter of the 12th century, and the last major addition was the disproportionately large chancel, built during the second quarter of the 14th century by a workshop known by its notname as Egypticus. The workshop was also responsible for constructing the largest of the church portals, which is also decorated with Gothic stone sculpture. The tower portal contains sculptures attributed to the Romanesque sculptor Sigraf. The church has been little altered since the end of the Middle Ages. Lye Church contains the largest preserved set of medieval stained glass windows in the Nordic countries, and its interior is also decorated by medieval wall paintings, uncovered in the 1950s. The altarpiece is from 1496, and the church also contains a triumphal cross from the same period. Location and surroundings Lye Church is located south of the main road between Hemse and Ljugarn, on south-eastern Gotland. The church lies surrounded by its old cemetery. A low () stone wall, built sometime between 1765 and 1793 to replace an earlier wooden fence, limit the cemetery to the south, east and west. The northern part of the wall is partially demolished and opens up to a newer section of the cemetery, established north of the old one in 1944. The cemetery has four entrances. The formerly northern limit of the old cemetery is marked by a row of European ash and the younger part is bordered on all sides by small-leaved limes. A small storage building, constructed sometime before 1846, lies in the northwestern part of the old part of the cemetery. History Lye Church was built and to a large extent acquired its current appearance during the Middle Ages. No major alterations have been made since the 14th century. =Construction= The oldest part of the church, probably constructed during the last quarter of the 12th century, is the nave, built in a Romanesque style. The tower was erected during the first half of the 13th century. When the tower was built, the western wall of the nave was demolished so that the tower could be incorporated with the church building. The difference between the bases of the tower and the northern nave wall still indicate where the break was made. The Gothic chancel and sacristy are from the second quarter of the 14th century and replaced an earlier chancel, constructed at the same time as the nave. They were built by a workshop operating on Gotland which has been assigned the notname . The portal of the former chancel was removed and reinstated in its present position as north entrance to the nave. The intention was probably to also rebuild the nave, but this was never done. The walls connecting the chancel and nave are still the provisional, thin walls without a marked base which were put in place in anticipation of further changes. =Later changes= The decorated wooden ceiling dates from the 18th century. The three windows of the nave probably all date from the 1850s and replaced earlier, much smaller windows. A major renovation of the interior of the church was carried out in 1891. The floors of the chancel and nave were renewed, and the pews replaced with new ones. The altar rail was replaced, as was the organ facade. Central heating was installed in 1932. In 1939, the presently visible roof of the tower was installed, modeled after an earlier roof possibly designed by architect Olof Tempelman and dating from 1779. Tempelman's designs were probably executed by builder Hans Hesselby, who also constructed the roof of the tower at Ala Church in 1780. The earlier roof may have resembled those at Garde or Burs churches. Another large-scale renovation was done in 1954‚Äì55 under the guidance of architects and . The main structural change was that the walls of the nave were heightened with the dual purpose of exposing the top part of the arch connecting the chancel with the nave, and installing a modern, fire-proof ceiling above the wooden ceiling. The walls of the nave and chancel were at the same time cleaned, and the medieval paintings found under layers of whitewash restored. Wall paintings from the 18th century were removed, and some of the furnishings renovated. The exterior was renovated and the presently visible roofs were put in place in 1968. Architecture =Exterior= One of the Romanesque galleries of the tower from the outside The walls of Lye Church are constructed of mainly grey, tufted limestone, whitewashed on the outside. A few details are made of brick and of limestone of a different colour. The portals, bases and skirtings around some of the windows are of dressed limestone, as are the corners of the chancel and tower. In broad outlines, the nave and tower are Romanesque in style while the chancel is Gothic. The disproportionate aspect of the church is derived from the fact that the rebuilding of the church during the Middle Ages was never finished, hence the later and larger chancel dominates the east end of the church. The shape, not uncommon among churches on Gotland, has been compared to that of a pack saddle. The tower is the most well-preserved Romanesque part of the church. On the north and south side of the first storey there are galleries accessible from inside the tower, each with two openings in the form of round arches separated by a small column. The outer archivolts of these openings are made of alternating limestone and brick, an unusual construction material on Gotland during the Middle Ages. The upper level contains the church bell, which dates from 1650 and was made in Stockholm. There are three openings for the bell on each side of the square tower. All of them with have round arches and each opening is divided in two by a central, wooden column. Portals Stone container with a Romanesque frieze immured in the tower portal The western capitals of the chancel portal, depicting the Adoration of the Magi (left) and the Massacre of the Innocents The church has four entrance portals. Three of these are Romanesque: the western entrance in the base of the tower, the northern entrance to the nave and the southern entrance to the nave. The chancel portal is larger and more profusely decorated. The tower portal has a round outer arch which consists of alternating red and grey limestone; the inner arch is made of grey, roughly hewn limestone. Immured as part of the southern post is a decorated stone container, which may originally have been intended as a sarcophagus or a reliquary but later used as building material. It has been roughly adjusted to fit into the church wall. The exposed sides are decorated with figures in low relief. The short side facing the door depicts the Madonna enthroned while the long side, facing the exterior, depicts scenes which have been interpreted as (from left to right) two legendary creatures fighting, two dragons or possible one dragon with two heads, a warrior with armour and weapons, and a horse. It has been suggested that the subject matter depicted is the story of Sigurd slaying the dragon Fafnir. The reliefs date from the 12th century and have been attributed to the Romanesque artist or workshop Sigraf (floruit 1175‚Äì1210). The northern portal of the nave is the smallest entrance to the church. Its round arched opening is constructed of alternating blocks of limestone and sandstone. It appears to not be original to its position and may have been removed from the earlier, demolished chancel to its present location during the Middle Ages. The southern portal of the nave is constructed of alternating red and grey limestone. Its inner section consists of two pillars of convex cubic form supporting a round arch. The chancel portal is the largest of the entrances, and Gothic in style. It is a comparatively richly decorated, pointed arch crowned by a wimperg made of grey and red limestone. The tympanum is decorated with sculpted flowers, and the capitals of the nested columns each contain a set of sculptures with the overarching theme being the childhood of Christ. The sculpted eastern capitals show, from left to right, the Annunciation, the Visitation, the birth of Christ, and the annunciation to the shepherds. The western capitals contain scenes showing, from left to right, the Adoration of the Magi and the Massacre of the Innocents. The wimperg above the portal depicts Christ enthroned, with one hand raised in a blessing and the other resting on a book. The sculptures are unusually well preserved, and a few of the figures still contain faint traces of original colour (black, red, and green). The sculptures show several similarities with those at Norrlanda Church and have been described as some of the best examples of the art of Egypticus. =Interior= The interior is divided into three main rooms, and the sacristy. The westernmost room is the ground floor of the tower. It is a broad, vaulted room that opens toward the nave with a wide arch. The nave is rectangular, with a flat, wooden ceiling. The chancel is relatively large and high, lacks an apse, and has a vaulted ceiling. The nave and chancel are connected by a pointed limestone arch. The sacristy ceiling is supported by a groin vault. There are three niches in the walls of the chancel. Of the two in the northern wall, one is most probably a medieval tabernacle with still original doors and flanked by two immured limestone capitals, probably also made by Egypticus. The other niche on the same wall consists of three compartments and its doors probably date from the 1891 renovation. On the same wall is the entrance to the sacristy, between a simple trefoil-shaped portal of limestone. In the church floor there are also several medieval gravestones, including one made for a local man called Jakob, who according to the inscription was killed by a cannonball while participating in a siege of Eric of Pomerania at Visborg castle in the outskirts of Visby in 1449. The walls of the church also contain a number of carvings in the surface of the wall, made in historic times. These include some pictorial, depicting among the subjects a Troy Town and 15th-century ships, as well as around 40 runic inscriptions. As late as 2018, an earlier unknown runic inscription was discovered in the church; although its meaning remains unclear, it may be a profanity. Wall paintings The interior of Lye Church is decorated with medieval wall paintings from three separate periods. The paintings were covered with layers of whitewash during the 18th century and exposed and restored during the church renovation in the 1950s. The oldest set of paintings date from 1350 and decorate the chancel vault and its northern wall with large-scale figures. The paintings on the northern wall have been supplemented with other paintings from the 15th century. The second set of paintings date from around 1450 and adorn the walls of both the nave and the chancel. They depict the Passion of Christ as well as scenes from legends of saints and individual saints within frames imitating architecture. These were made by the Passion Master or that workshop. The third set of paintings date from the second quarter of the 16th century and encompass two scenes on the southern wall of the nave. Only a few wall paintings of such late date are known from Gotland. Windows View of the chancel with the stained glass windows and the altarpiece Lye Church contains the largest preserved set of medieval stained glass in the Nordic countries. They are also among the best preserved, and of the highest artisanal quality. Stained glass panes are preserved in the eastern and southern windows of the chancel. In total, there are 15 window panes with figurative depicitons, four panes with architectural details and 15 with decorative foliage, all dating from the construction period of the chancel. The subject matter of the middle of the eastern chancel windows are the life of Christ. The northern half of the window contains scenes from the childhood of Christ until the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, and the southern half scenes from the Passion until the Ascension. The two windows on each side of the middle window, as well as the window in the southern wall of the chancel, contains depictions of individual saints and purely ornamental window panes. The windows are in a High Gothic style, the figures depicted as slim and delicate, with loose clothes and rhythmically curly hair and beards. The overall composition is airy, with few overlaps between the different elements. The colours are dominated by the blue of the background and the red bands that separate the figures; the windows are comparatively paler and cooler in colour than earlier stained glass windows on Gotland. The overall impression has been described by art historian Johnny Roosval as \\"incense for the eye\\". It has been suggested that the glass windows were made by a workshop active in Visby. Roosval argued that the main stylistic influences for the windows in Lye came from English Gothic, while instead argued that the main influences came from northern Germany. Furnishings View towards the chancel. To the right is the pulpit, in the chancel arch hangs the triumphal cross, and inside the chancel the altarpiece, stained glass windows and the medieval tabernacle in the wall are all discernible The altarpiece carries an inscription in Latin which relates that it was donated to the church in 1496 by a farmer named Jon who lived in the parish. It is made of painted and gilded oak, and consists of a centrepiece, flanked by pinnacles, and two wings. The middle section contains a sculpted representation of God the Father with the dead Christ in his arms, surrounded by angels. It is flanked by twelve statuettes of the apostles. The outsides of the wings are decorated with rather severely damaged paintings, depicting the saints Olaf, Lawrence, John the Baptist and Stephen. The predella is painted with a depiction of the Veil of Veronica. The triumphal cross hanging under the chancel arch is a work from the late 15th century, possibly made by the same artist who made the altarpiece. It depicts Christ on the cross with black hair and beard and a green crown of thorns. Its overall height is . The limestone baptismal font lacks decoration and dates from the middle of the 13th century. The pulpit is marked with the date 1705 and the monogram of King Charles XII of Sweden. It was painted in 1726 with depictions of the Four Evangelists and the apostles James and Peter. Four medieval items from Lye Church are today in the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm. Two are former altarpieces, both damaged, one of which depicts the revelations of Saint Bridget of Sweden. The other two items are a 13th-century Limoges enamel processional cross, and a gilded Limoges enamel and copper figure of Christ. Current use and heritage status Lye Church belongs to within , itself part of the Diocese of Visby within the Church of Sweden. Lye Church is an ecclesiastical monument, number 21300000002810 (sub-number: 21400000444058) in the buildings database of the Swedish National Heritage Board. In 2019, Lye Church was one of the first 56 cultural heritage monuments on Gotland and in Sweden to be explicitly marked with the blue and white shield of the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.

Protection of film heritage The European Commission directly supports efforts to protect Europe's film heritage. The legal basis for action is Article 167 of the TFEU (Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union), which encourages member states to support the conservation and safeguard of the cultural heritage, including film heritage.

The Lower Hutt suburb of Stokes Valley in New Zealand commemorates his name.  Origins  Stokes was born in Jamaica on 16 January 1809,\\"Jamaica Church of England Parish Register Transcripts, 1664-1880,\\" index and images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/VHDC-6S3 : accessed 20 Aug 2013), Robert Stokes, 1809.Stated on grave at Kensal Green Cemetery, London the son of Robert Stokes (then chief clerk in the Post Office in Jamaica) and of Martha Frances Stokes.

Admitted to full studentship in June 1830, he was awarded a silver medal that year. He appears not to have completed the usual number of years as a student, because by 1831, he had moved to Cheltenham, where the Pittville estate was under active development by its eponymous promoter, Joseph Pitt. There is some indication that Chantrey knew Pitt,Chantrey letter to C H Turner, dated 5 Nov. 1831 and this possibly accounts for Stokes taking up work in Cheltenham. In 1832, while resident in Cheltenham, he married Margaret Pughe, daughter of the late Rev Lewis Pughe of Liverpool.Worcester Journal of 23 Feb 1832, and similar in Oxford Journal of 18 February 1832 Stokes worked for Pitt for a number of years, designing the Tudor Gothic-style Female Orphan Asylum in Winchcombe Street and the ornamental Pittville Gates, both of 1833, which formed part of Pitt's plan to make Winchcombe Street a 'grand entrance' route to his new estate;Cheltenham Chronicle, 28 Nov. 1833 Stokes also worked on several of the larger private houses in Pittville.S Blake, Pittville, 1824-1860 (1988) He parted company with Pitt in 1835, apparently in financial difficulties, but resided in Cheltenham a little longer. His only other recorded architectural works in England are the Gothic churches at Amberley (1836) and Oakridge (1835-1837), both in Gloucestershire. After his migration to New Zealand, he produced the design for a Wesleyan Chapel (fronted in the classical style) and mission house, built 1844 in Manners Street, Wellington.S C Brees, Pictorial Illustrations of New Zealand, (1847) The chapel did not survive the 1848 earthquake.  Career in public life in New Zealand  On 10 April 1839 he approached the New Zealand Company for a position, and was attached to Mein Smith's survey staff. He sailed for New Zealand on the Cuba, arriving at Port Nicholson on 3 January 1840. During the next few months he carried out surveys in the Wellington-Hutt Valley district, where he gave his name to Stokes Valley. Early in 1842 he resigned from the Company to enter business on his own account.A H McLintock, Encyclopaedia of New Zealand He was never afraid of voicing his opinion on public affairs, and his first 'letters to the editor' appeared in 1840‚Äì41, on the subject of better ways of preventing cattle straying onto cultivated land - in particular his acre near the harbour in Wellington.New Zealand Gazette and Wellington Spectator, 30 Jan. 1841, p. 3 He was one of the co-founders of the New Zealand Spectator and Cook's Straits Guardian, and was active as a publisher of newspapers and books until at least 1865. He was appointed as a Justice of the Peace in 1861, and continued in this office until at least 1866.Page 7 Advertisements Column 1 (Wellington Independent, 13 August 1861). Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand. http://natlib.govt.nz/records/20310271 Stokes represented Wellington City in the Provincial Council from 1857 to 1865 and Wairarapa East from then until 1867. In 1858 he carried a Bill through the Council to establish municipal government for Wellington and, in the same year, advocated the construction of a railway across the Rimutaka Range. Although his scheme was derided at first (the line required some challenging inclines), Stokes continued his agitation. In 1863 he induced the Council to agree to accept Robert Mudge Marchant's tender to build the first 18 miles of the line for ¬£150,000, but the deal fell through. Four years later Stokes endeavoured to revive the project, but nothing was done until Vogel incorporated it in his public works scheme of the early 1870s. Stokes was summoned to the New Zealand Legislative Council in 1862, serving from 12 July 1862 to 24 September 1879 when he was disqualified for absence (he had returned to England in poor health). From 1871 to 1878 he was a member of the Senate of the University of New Zealand.Appointed Feb 1871: The Evening Post. SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1871. (Evening Post, 17 February 1871). Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand. http://natlib.govt.nz/records/17134674 In the Legislative Council he became well known for his forthright opinions on the major political issues of the day. Notwithstanding his extensive interests in Hawke's Bay, Stokes continued to reside in Wellington. He was one of the Commissioners for the Wellington City Reserves in 1862. He was also active in church affairs, serving for a time as a lay member of the Synod of the Diocese of Wellington.See e.g. http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi- bin/paperspast?a=d&d;=WI18650930.2.14 Throughout his life he gave much encouragement to agriculture and by 1842The Gardener's Magazine, Vol XIX, 1843, page 325 and for some years after, was treasurer of the Wellington Horticultural and Botanical Society.McLintock, op. cit.

Throughout its history, it fought various adversaries including the Durrani Empire of Afghanistan and the British East India Company. The Sikhs very commonly fought battles in which they had much less force than their foes. However, they had an impressive success rate. Background The Sikhs first raised their weapons against the Mughal Empire under Guru Hargobind. Guru Hargobind was son of the 5th Guru Arjan who was executed by the Mughal ruler Jahangir. After his father's death, Guru Hargobind added the martial element to Sikhism which was until then a religion mainly focused on Spirituality. But at this point the need for self defence was felt. Hence Guru Hargobind started recruiting an army which he called \\"Risaldari\\", after training his men in cavalry and Sikh Martial Arts. He adopted Royal symbols like wearing \\"kalgidhari turban\\" and keeping bodyguards. Along with that he asked his followers to gift him horses and weaponry instead of anything else. So the 6th Guru at one point maanaged to command 700 cavalry and with this might his Risaldari fought several small scale battles in 1620s and 1630s against Shahjahan's forces and some other warlords in Poadh and Majha. The tenth and the last Guru, Guru Gobind Singh organized Sikhs into a military sect called Khalsa (means \\"pure\\"), in 1699, against the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. Before his death in 1708, he sent Banda Bahadur to lead the Sikhs of Punjab. Banda Bahadur through his outstanding leadership skills weakened the Mughal grasp over India. But he was later captured and beheaded in Delhi in 1716, during the reign of Farrukhsiyar. Thereafter, Sikhs became leaderless and were divided into Misls. Although their martial skills were enormous, their political disunity made them vulnerable to foreign attacks. In 1738, Nadir Shah of Iran, attacked India , looted Delhi and Mughals were never able to recover their power in Punjab. Later, Punjab was subject to constant invasions of Ahmad Shah Durrani of Afghanistan, who upon hearing of the persecution of Muslims of Punjab by the invading Sikhs, took it as his duty to protect the Muslims. During every invasion of Abdali, defeated the Sikhs. According to some the scene outside the holy shrine of Harmandir Sahib was the scene of one of these battles. Abdali tried many times to recover Lahore but ultimately had to return to Pashtun territories. After his final invasion of Punjab in 1767, he left Lahore which was when it was re-captured by the Sikhs. For more than three decades, Sikhs consolidated their power in areas of Punjab. But the decisive moment came in 1790, when Ranjit Singh of Sukerchakia misl became misldar. He started uniting misls and finally took Lahore in 1799. His coronation on 12 April 1801 marked the beginning of the Sikh Empire, which went on to conquer the whole Punjab, Kangra, parts of Kashmir and briefly, the city of Peshawar.

He won several juvenile and junior championships before beginning to compete for prize money at the age of 15, which in Australian at that time deemed him a professional. In 1967 Gilmore was awarded both Australian Professional Road & Track Cyclist of the Year from \\"Road & Track\\" magazine readers, and became an inaugural member of the Tasmanian Sporting Hall of Fame.

The government was made up of members of the Liberal‚ÄìNational Coalition. The Leader of The Nationals, Warren Truss, served as Deputy Prime Minister. Following the 2013 Australian federal election held on 7 September, the Coalition defeated the second Rudd Government, ending six years of Labor Government. The Abbott Government was sworn into office on 18 September 2013. Less than two years later on 14 September 2015, Malcolm Turnbull defeated Abbott in a leadership ballot, 54 votes to 44 and the Turnbull Government became the executive government of Australia. In economic policy, the Abbott Government aimed to rein in a budget deficit that reached A$48.5 billion by June 2014. It concluded free trade agreements with China, Japan and South Korea. It removed the Rudd-Gillard era Resource Super Profits Tax and carbon pricing.Promise check: Abolish the carbon tax, ABC Fact checkerPromise Check: Abolish the Mining Tax; ABC Fact Checker It established the National Commission of Audit to advise on restoring the Budget to surplus; instituted the Royal Commission into trade union governance and corruption; founded the Medical Research Future Fund; and produced White Papers on Developing Northern Australia and the Agricultural Competitiveness. Treasurer Joe Hockey delivered two Budgets, the first focused on expenditure reduction measures, but faced a hostile reception in the Senate and media. Partial deregulation of universities, and a $7 contribution to doctor visits were proposed, but blocked by the Senate. The second Budget emphasised stimulus for the small business sector. Abbott campaigned in opposition and in office to halt the people smuggling trade, and unauthorised maritime arrivals ceased during his term of office under Operation Sovereign Borders. In foreign policy, Australia continued its military engagement in the Mid-East, amid the worsening Syrian conflict. In 2015, The Abbott Government agreed to resettle an additional 12,000 refugees from the region. Abbott and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop challenged Russia at the United Nations over the shooting down of Malaysian Flight MH17 in Ukraine. The Government launched the New Colombo Plan to encourage educational exchange with the Indo-Pacific region. Domestically, Abbott campaigned for recognition of Indigenous Australians in the Australian Constitution, flagging a referendum for 2017, and promised a plebiscite on the issue of same-sex marriage. Air and road infrastructure was prioritised. Abbott had to negotiate a hostile Senate. The Palmer United Party had emerged at the 2013 election, but fractured soon after. The Liberal Party faced Cabinet leaks and early leadership instability, after a poorly received first Budget and amid media criticism. Abbott became the shortest-serving Australian Prime Minister since William McMahon, when his government was succeeded by the Turnbull Government. Turnbull cited Newspoll results and \\"economic leadership\\" as reasons for mounting his challenge against Abbott. Background Senior members of the government following their swearing-in ceremony: Warren Truss, Tony Abbott, Julie Bishop, and Eric Abetz. The Liberal‚ÄìNational coalition, led by Abbott, won the 2013 Australian federal election, returning their Coalition to power after six years in opposition. Abbott, a Rhodes Scholar, and former trainee Catholic priest, journalist and political advisor, had entered Parliament in 1994 as the Member for Warringah and served as a senior minister in the Howard Government, which lost office at the 2007 election to the Australian Labor Party, led by Kevin Rudd. Abbott served as Shadow Minister for Indigenous Affairs under Liberal leaders Brendan Nelson and Malcolm Turnbull and then became Leader of the Opposition following a 2009 leadership spill in which he defeated the incumbent leader, Turnbull, by one vote. Rudd did not complete his first term in office, having been replaced by Julia Gillard following an internal Labor party leadership vote in June 2010. Abbott led the Coalition to the 2010 federal election, which saw the Gillard Government narrowly retain office by forming a minority government with the support of four crossbench MPs after the election produced a hung parliament. Leadership instability in the Labor Party continued, and Gillard was replaced by Rudd following a Labor ballot conducted shortly before the 2013 election. As Opposition Leader, Abbott opposed the Rudd‚ÄìGillard government's introduction of a mining profits tax, and emissions trading scheme and carbon tax, and criticised the handling of asylum seeker policy. He offered support to the Gillard government's National Disability Insurance Scheme, and matched the government on its first four years funding for the Gonski restructuring of education funding. He took a proposal for an expanded paid parental leave scheme, part funded by a levy on big business, to the 2010 and 2013 elections. If elected, he promised to instigate a referendum to give recognition to Indigenous Australians in the Australian Constitution, and to prioritise indigenous affairs by placing it within the department of prime minister and cabinet, saying: \\"There will be, in effect, a prime minister for Aboriginal affairs\\". In his 2013 election campaign, Abbott told the media that the Coalition wanted to \\"build a stronger economy so that everyone can get ahead. We'll scrap the carbon tax, end the waste, stop the boats and build the infrastructure and the roads of the 21st century.\\" 2013 election The Liberal Party under Abbott, together with the National Party, led by Warren Truss, achieved a 3.65-point two-party-preferred swing at the 2013 election, winning 90 of the Australian House of Representatives seats compared with the Labor Party's 55. The Greens retained their one seat in the chamber, with Bob Katter of Katter's Australian Party also returned. Two independents won seats in the House, and the seat of Fairfax fell from the Nationals to Clive Palmer, leader of the newly formed Palmer United Party. The emergence of the fledgling Palmer United Party was a notable feature of the election. The new party secured a House of Representatives seat and three senators (although two senators subsequently split from the party). The Greens, which had been in alliance with Labor for the preceding three years, lost one senator and a third of their vote under new leader Christine Milne. The party had campaigned heavily against Abbott and promised to block his key election commitment to abolish the carbon tax it had jointly introduced with the Gillard government. The Australian Electoral Commission successfully petitioned the High Court for the West Australian Senate election to be declared void, on account of 1,375 ballot papers lost during a recount after the election. The initial count had declared the Liberals and Labor winners of four of six seats, with remaining two going to Zhenya Wang of the Palmer United Party, and Labor's Senator Louise Pratt. The faulty recount narrowly gave the final two seats to Wayne Dropulich of the Australian Sports Party, and to the Greens' Senator Scott Ludlam. In February 2014, the High Court ordered a new Senate election for Western Australia. Appointments Tony Abbott is sworn in by Governor-General Quentin Bryce The Abbott government after being commissioned by Quentin Bryce on 18 September 2013. Governor-General Quentin Bryce officially commissioned the Abbott Ministry on 18 September 2013. Fifteen of Abbott's ministers had served in the Howard Government. The Leader of the National Party, Warren Truss, became Deputy Prime Minister, Joe Hockey assumed the post of Treasurer and Deputy Liberal Leader Julie Bishop became the first woman appointed Foreign Minister of Australia. Senator Mathias Cormann was promoted to the position of Minister for Finance. Of the three female members of the Abbott Shadow Cabinet, Julie Bishop retained her position in Foreign Affairs following the 2013 election, while Bronwyn Bishop became Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives, and the Shadow Industry Minister Sophie Mirabella lost her seat at the election. Bronwyn Bishop resigned as Speaker in 2015. Julie Bishop remained the only woman in Cabinet until Sussan Ley was appointed to Cabinet to replace Peter Dutton as Health and Sport Minister in 2014 when Dutton was made Immigration Minister in Abbott's Cabinet revision. Five other women were appointed to posts in the outer ministry, and one of the twelve parliamentary secretaries is female. Philip Ruddock, the longest serving member in the Parliament, was appointed Chief Government Whip. Eric Abetz retained the portfolio of Employment, George Brandis was appointed Attorney-General, Christopher Pyne as Education Minister, and Abbott's former leadership rival Malcolm Turnbull took Communications. In his speech following his swearing-in ceremony, Abbott said his government would \\"strive to govern for all Australians\\": \\"We won't forget those who are often marginalised; people with disabilities, Indigenous people and women struggling to combine career and family. We will do our best not to leave anyone behind. We hope to be judged by what we have done rather than by what we have said we will do.\\" The Abbott ministry was not announced for an unusually long period and the Agence France Presse reported that Abbott had set out to stamp a \\"markedly different style on government\\" standing \\"in stark contrast to the 'chaos' he liked to accuse his Labor predecessors of fomenting as almost hourly soundbites, lengthy press conferences and briefings were cranked out in an effort to control the 24-hour news cycle\\". Responsibility for women's policies and programs was moved from the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs into the Prime Minister's Office, with Michaelia Cash appointed Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women. The ministry also divided responsibilities for science between the portfolios of Education, under Christopher Pyne, and Industry, under Ian McFarlane. The December 2014 Cabinet reshuffle saw Ian McFarlane become the Minister for Industry and Science. Term of government =Foreign affairs= Minister for Foreign Affairs and Deputy Liberal Leader, Julie Bishop. Julie Bishop became the first woman to represent Australia as Minister for Foreign Affairs. In Opposition, Abbott and Bishop pledged that a Coalition government would shift Australia's foreign policy focus to be \\"less Geneva, more Jakarta\\". Abbott chose the Indonesian capital as his first overseas destination, and travelled to Jakarta on 30 September 2013, to meet with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on 30 September 2013. In October, Abbott returned to Indonesia to attend his first APEC leaders' summit, to discuss trade and economic relations and meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, US Secretary of State John Kerry and other world leaders. Following the summit, Abbott travelled to Bali, where he laid a wreath at the memorial of the 2002 Bali bombing. He also announced a commitment to extend compensation to Australian victims of terrorist attacks, allowing payments of up to A$75,000 to those who suffered in attacks on New York, London, Egypt, Mumbai, Jakarta, Bali and Nairobi since 2001. In Brunei, Abbott also attended his first East Asia Summit with world leaders, including India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. In 2013, prior to the election of the Abbott government, US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden had been granted asylum by Russia after handing over large amounts of confidential information from US government databases to world media. Australian‚ÄìIndonesian diplomatic relations began to suffer in the early months of the government, as The Guardian and ABC News began to publish material, which had been made public due to Snowden's leaking, suggesting that Australian spy agencies during the term of the previous government had spied on the Indonesian President and his wife. The alleged spying had taken place soon after the July 2009 bombing of Jakarta's Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels. Indonesia recalled its ambassador over the affair.  Shooting down of MH17  During the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down in a missile attack. Julie Bishop and Australia's UN Ambassador Gary Quinlan led negotiations at the United Nations Security Council to adopt a unanimous resolution, demanding that the armed groups in control of the crash site refrain from interfering with it and allow for the repatriation of victims and an international investigation into the attack. Bishop was honoured by The Netherlands for her role in securing the resolution and investigation. The downing of the flight had resulted in 298 deaths, including 38 Australian citizens and residents. In the lead up to the 2014 G20 meeting in Brisbane, Tony Abbott focused world attention on Russia's role in the shooting down of the civilian plane. In a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the APEC meeting in Beijing, Abbott reportedly told the president that Australia had information that the missile that destroyed the plane had Russian origin and that Russia should consider apologising and offering appropriate restitution to the victims of the shooting. Russia continued to deny involvement. = Trade = Trade Minister Andrew Robb. Andrew Robb served as Minister for Trade and Investment. In April 2014, Abbott led a trade delegation to Japan, South Korea and China. The three economies accounted for more than half of all of Australia's two-way trade. By the close of his tenure, Abbott's government had struck free trade agreements with the three nations. The Abbott Government also established the Germany-Australia Advisory Group, to advise on improving trade relations, and pursued trade agreements with Indonesia and India.Malcolm Turnbull embarks on five-nation tour, meeting 20 world leaders; Australian Broadcasting Corporation; 13 November 2015Trade deal with India on track: minister; sbs.com.au; 29 October 2015 Free trade agreements ; Japan‚ÄìAustralia Economic Partnership Agreement On the Japanese leg of the 2014 trade mission, Abbott agreed the key elements of a free trade agreement with the government of Shinzo Abe. A number of concessions were secured for Australian agricultural exporters, while Australian tariffs on electronics, whitegoods and cars were to be lowered. Negotiations for the agreement began under the Howard Government in 2007. Abbott said, \\"This is the first time that Japan has negotiated a comprehensive economic partnership agreement or free trade agreement with a major economy, particularly a major economy with a strong agricultural sector.\\" Abe travelled to Australia in July to sign the Japan‚ÄìAustralia Economic Partnership Agreement, and address the Australian Parliament. ; Australia Korea Free Trade Agreement On the South Korean leg of the mission, Abbott signed the Australia Korea Free Trade Agreement (KAFTA) with the government of Park Geun-hye in Seoul. The agreement reduced tariffs on primary products and reset the foreign investment review threshold to more than $1 billion. ;China‚ÄìAustralia Free Trade Agreement The Abbott trade mission continued on to China, where he met with Premier Li Keqiang and President Xi Jinping. In an address to the Boao Forum, Abbott said \\"Team Australia\\" is in China to \\"help build the Asian century\\". He was accompanied by Foreign Minister Bishop, Trade Minister Robb, five of Australia's state premiers, and 30 of the country's senior business executives. Abbott also discussed the search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, being led by Australia. Abbott announced military co-operation between the China and Australia would be developed to include high-level meetings, staff exchanges and joint exercises. He also announced that President Xi would address the Australian Parliament in 2015. The China‚ÄìAustralia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA) was signed in Canberra on 17 June 2015, by Andrew Robb, and the Chinese Commerce Minister, Gao Hucheng. Abbott hailed the agreement, saying that, along with the Korean and Japan agreements, it would underpin Australia's prosperity in coming years. Labor campaigned against the agreement during the Canning by-election, but subsequently agreed to support the Turnbull Government in ratifying the FTA. =Defence= The Abbott Government period saw the continued wind down of Australia's involvement in the Afghanistan conflict and moves to enhance co- operation with China, Japan and the United States in regional defence operations, but also saw the deterioration of the Syrian Civil War and rise of the threat of Islamic State, along with an ongoing Islamist terrorism threat to Australia and its allies. Abbott committed to increasing Defence spending to two per cent of GDP within a decade.Minister for Defence Budget 2015: Defence Budget Overview ; www.ministerdefence.gov.au; 12 May 2015 David Johnston served as Minister for Defence until December 2014, when he was replaced by Kevin Andrews. At the end of October 2013, Abbott travelled to Afghanistan with opposition leader Bill Shorten for a special ceremony at the Australian base in Tarin Kowt in Uruzgan, saying that \\"Australia's longest war is ending. Not with victory, not with defeat, but with, we hope, an Afghanistan that is better for our presence here.\\" Afghan forces were scheduled to take over running of the camp in mid-December. Tony Abbott with US Secretary of State John Kerry in June 2014. Abbott met with US President Barack Obama in June 2014, in Washington, and approved a legal agreement for the deployment of around 1,300 US Marines to the Northern Territory, first proposed under the Gillard Government. Abbott also moved to strengthen economic and defence ties with Japan, signing the Japan‚ÄìAustralia Economic Partnership Agreement and inviting Shinz≈ç Abe to address Parliament and announcing a transfer of defence technology and equipment would be included in it. In 2014, the government announced the investment of $12 billion in F-35 joint strike fighters. ; Submarine construction Fairfax Political Editor Mark Kenny attributed the anti-Liberal swing in the 2014 Fisher state by-election in South Australia to Federal factors associated with the Defence Portfolio, writing: \\"People on both sides of the aisle in Adelaide say the dominant factor was the Abbott government's perceived intention to buy submarines 'off the shelf' from Japan rather than build the high-tech vessels in South Australia as had been promised.\\" Days prior to the by-election, the Defence Minister David Johnston had denounced the capabilities of the Australian Submarine Corporation which wanted to construct Australia's new submarine fleet at Adelaide, saying the company was at least $350 million over budget in building three air warfare destroyer ships: \\"You wonder why I'm worried about ASC and what they're delivering to the Australian taxpayer, you wonder why I wouldn't trust them to build a canoe?\\" the Minister told Parliament. Labor campaigned at the by-election on the issue, and linked Abbott to the state vote. Labor won the traditionally Liberal seat by just five votes from a 7.27 percent two-party swing to go from minority to majority government. ; MH370 search On 8 March 2014 Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 disappeared and presumably crashed somewhere in the Indian Ocean, within Australia's search and rescue zone. Consequently, the Chinese and Australian militaries co- operated in the search for the missing plane, and in April 2014 the People's Liberation Army asked to operate under Australian command in the largest international exercises in which it had ever participated. The Fairfax press reported: \\"It is believed to be the first time the PLA would operate under Western command in a military exercise\\". ; Islamic State deployment Following the Arab Spring uprisings, and withdrawal of the bulk of US troops from Iraq, the threat of Islamic State/ISIL/ISIS emerged, amid the deteriorating Syrian Civil War. The extremist Sunni Islamist group was battling government forces in Syria and Iraq, with the objective of establishing of an Islamic caliphate across the region. Domestic terrorist attacks by ISIS supporters occurred in Australia in 2014, with knife and gun attacks in Melbourne and Sydney against police and civilians. In October 2014, the Federal cabinet approved the decision to launch air strikes in Iraq in response to concerns over ISIL militant groups. Abbott announced that the Australian mission was to \\"disrupt and degrade\\" Islamic State \\"at home and abroad\\". According to Defence analyst and Abbott confidant Catherine McGregor, Abbott was frustrated at the lack of a serious effort to destroy ISIS and wanted to approach the British and the French to join him in lobbying the Obama Administration to escalate its campaign against the Islamic State, and to deploy Australian Special Forces to find and kill ISIS leaders.Opinion: Catherine McGregor says it's time to take the fight to ISIS; Catherine McGregor; The Courier-Mail; 5 April 2016 In September 2015, the Abbott Government expanded Australia's military mission, by joining US-led airstrikes against IS targets in Syria, and announced that 12,000 additional refugees from the region would be accepted. Shortly after losing office, Abbott gave this appraisal of the battle against Islamic State:  Terrorism  Prime Minister Tony Abbott addressing the United Nations General Assembly in 2014. The government was concerned as early as August 2014 that the Indonesian militant Islamist terror group Jemaah Islamiah has aligned itself to ISIL (ISIS), and formed a potential threat. On 23 September, the government raised Australia's terror alert level from medium to high. In September 2014, an Islamic State supporter was shot dead after stabbing two policemen in Melbourne, and in December, an Islamic State supporter was shot dead after taking hostages and holding up a caf√© in Martin Place, Sydney, in an attack in which two hostages died. A month later, Abbott condemned the Charlie Hebdo terror attacks in France as an \\"unspeakable atrocity\\". When 60 people were killed in attacks in France, Tunisia and Kuwait on one day on 27 June, Abbott said: \\"This illustrates yet again that as far as the Daesh death cult is concerned, it's coming after us.\\" In July, Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull told the Sydney Institute that ISIL is not \\"Hitler's Germany, Tojo's Japan or Stalin's Russia\\" and that government should not amplify its significance. At the opening of a regional summit against terrorism in Sydney in June 2015, Abbott praised the leadership against Islamist terrorism shown by Muslim statesmen such as Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib ‚Äì who had described ISIS as \\"against God, against Islam and against our common humanity\\" ‚Äì and of Egypt's president el-Sissi ‚Äì who told Egyptian imams that Islam needed a \\"religious revolution\\". After losing office, Abbott said on Paul Murray Live on 8 December 2015: \\"We've got to work closely with live-and-let- live Muslims because there needs to be, as President (Abdel Fattah) Al-Sisi of Egypt has said, a religious revolution inside Islam... All of those things that Islam has never had ‚Äì a Reformation, an Enlightenment, a well-developed concept of the separation of church and state ‚Äì that needs to happen, but we can't do it; Muslims have got to do this for themselves.\\" =Citizenship= In 2015, the cabinet debated giving the immigration minister new powers to strip dual nationals of their citizenship if they are supporters of terrorist organisations. =Indigenous affairs= Abbott, a former Indigenous Affairs Minister, reformed the portfolio and brought it within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, saying: \\"There will be, in effect, a prime minister for Aboriginal affairs\\". Northern Territory Senator Nigel Scullion was appointed the Minister for Indigenous Affairs in the Abbott Ministry. Scullion, also served as Leader of the Nationals in the Senate. In 2013, Andrew Forrest was chosen to lead a review into Indigenous employment and training programs, which was to report to the Australian government. The review was delivered on 1 August 2014, with 27 recommendations. This was the genesis of the Healthy Welfare Card initiative. In his February 2014 \\"Closing the Gap\\" report to Parliament, Abbott said that Australia was failing to meet the \\"more important and the more meaningful targets\\" of reducing Indigenous disadvantage, and proposed to add a new target to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous school attendance within five years. ; Constitutional recognition Speaking at the Welcome to Country ceremony to mark the opening of the 44th Parliament, Abbott committed to pursuing recognition of Indigenous Australians in the Australian Constitution, and noted that the 44th parliament would have two indigenous members. Liberal MP Ken Wyatt chaired an all-party Parliamentary Committee examining the issue, and released a report in June 2015 ahead of a bi-partisan summit. In NAIDOC Week 2015, Abbott and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten jointly hosted a summit with around 40 indigenous leaders at Kirribilli House to discuss the process for achieving Constitutional recognition. Abbott said he hoped the wording for a referendum could be concluded in 2016, for a referendum vote in 2017.Indigenous referendum: Australians invited to join community conferences on recognition vote; Australian Broadcasting Corporation; 6 July 2015 ; Indigenous Advisory Council Abbott's announced an Indigenous Advisory Council in November 2013. The council was to meet three times a year with the Prime Minister and senior ministers to advise the government on policy implementation. Aimed at sparking \\"new engagement\\" with indigenous Australians, the 12 member council was headed by Warren Mundine. In December 2013 the government announced that was unlikely to provide further funding for the elected National Congress of Australia's First Peoples, which had been established in 2010 as the national representative body for Indigenous Australians. ; Remote community visits In Opposition, Abbott promised to spend a week a year in remote indigenous communities. In September 2014, Abbott and a number of Cabinet Ministers and Departmental Heads set up camp in an Aboriginal Community in Arnhem Land, near Nhulunbuy, 600 km East of Darwin. The Prime Minister discussed land tenure, welfare and Constitutional Recognition.Tony Abbott in Arnhem Land for talks with Aboriginal leaders; news.com.au; 14 September 2014 On his August 2015 week in remote indigenous communities, Abbott again discussed constitutional recognition and became the first Prime Minister to visit the grave of land rights champion Eddie Mabo.Tony Abbott visits Eddie Mabo's grave on Murray Island; Australian Broadcasting Corporation; 24 August 2015 ; Funding for indigenous affairs The government also reduced funding to the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services and associated policy officer positions in state governments, but not by as much as it had committed to during the election campaign. In June 2014, the ABC reported that the government planned to find a further $600 million in savings from Indigenous programs, in addition to the $534 million cuts in the 2014 budget. =Economic policy= Abbott Government Treasurer Joe Hockey. ; 2013 Election Launching his campaign for the 2013 Election, Tony Abbott outlined the economic priorities of the Coalition, promising to tackle government debt, eliminate \\"waste\\" in government expenditure, and decrease taxes which place a burden on industry and business: Abbott promised to \\"cut red tape\\" and reduce the company tax rate. He committed to abolishing the carbon tax, to bring down power and gas prices, and to abolishing the mining tax to increase investment and employment. On industrial relations, he promised to \\"move the workplace relations pendulum back to the sensible centre, restore a strong cop-on-the- beat in the construction industry, and hit dodgy union officials with the same penalties as corporate crooks.\\" ; Appointments Joe Hockey, a former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in the Howard government, became Treasurer of Australia, and Senator Mathias Cormann became Finance Minister in the Abbott government. Hockey had himself been a contender for the leadership of the Liberal Party in the ballot that saw Abbott win the role in 2009. Cormann had served as Shadow Assistant Treasurer and Shadow Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation. At a 27 September media conference Hockey said the government faced a challenge to sustain growth as the mining investment boom deflates, and indicated that the government was considering ways to stimulate infrastructure spending. Within the first year of their economic stewardship there were 790,000 people unemployed, with an unemployment rate of 6.4% ‚Äì a 12-year high and an increase of 0.7 points from the time the government came to office. Youth unemployment rose to a 17-year high. Hockey, eleven months after coming to office, blamed the steep rise in unemployment during his stewardship on the former government. The 2014 federal budget was released on 13 May. In 2015, the Department of Treasury released an intergenerational report, assessing the long-term sustainability of government policies based on demographic projections of Australia's population. In April, Peter Costello published an opinion piece in the Daily Telegraph describing proposed tax changes as a \\"morbid joke\\". National Commission of Audit The National Commission of Audit was announced by Treasurer Hockey, and the Minister for Finance, Senator Mathias Cormann, on 22 October 2013. It was established as an independent body to \\"review and report on the performance, functions and roles of the Commonwealth government\\" and to advise on eliminating wasteful spending and government inefficiency and make recommendations to achieve savings sufficient to deliver a surplus of 1 per cent of GDP prior to 2023‚Äì24.National Commission of Audit ‚Äì Terms of Reference ; ncoa.gov.au The government appointed Tony Shepherd AO to chair the commission. The other commissioners were: Dr Peter Boxall, Tony Cole, Robert Fisher and Amanda Vanstone.National Commission of Audit ‚Äì The Commissioners ; ncoa.gov.au Taxation In the 2013 Election campaign, Tony Abbott promised a \\"comprehensive tax white paper\\" to look at tax reform.Tony Abbott accepts 'we have a savings challenge'; 7.30; Australian Broadcasting Corporation; 15 August 2013 In June 2014, Abbott launched the Reform of the Federation white paper, with an eye to clarifying \\"roles and responsibilities for states and territories so that they are as far as possible, sovereign in their own sphere\\".Abbott launches white paper to reduce federal-state balance of power; Mark Kenny; The Sydney Morning Herald; 28 June 2014 In March 2015, Joe Hockey launched the Abbot Government's Tax White Paper titled \\"Re:think\\". In 2015 Abbott made calls for increasing the GST to 15%.https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/20/tony-abbott-backs- mike-bairds-call-to-raise-gst- to-15http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-03/advocates-of-gst-hike-making-very- powerful-point-abbott-says/6746500 Privatisation and efficiency The Abbott Government sought to cut spending and sell assets to rein in a budget deficit that reached A$48.5 billion by June 2014. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) chairman recommended the selling of assets to increase productivity. The National Commission of Audit report released in May 2014 recommended sale of the postal service, along with the Royal Australian Mint and other state assets. The Government raised $5.68 billion selling shares of Medibank Private, Australia's biggest health insurer (the sale was Australia's second-largest initial public offering). The 2014 Budget announced scoping studies for the privatisation of the Mint, Australian Hearing, the ASIC share registry and Defence Housing Australia, with its $10 billion real estate portfolio. In the 2015 Budget, the government opted to sell the Australian Securities and Investment Commission's share registry, but not the Mint or Defence Housing Australia. Industrial Relations In February 2014, Abbott announced the Royal Commission into trade union governance and corruption to inquire into financial irregularities associated with the affairs of trade unions. The Australian Workers Union, Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, Electrical Trades Union, Health Services Union and the Transport Workers Union were named in the terms of reference. The Royal Commission inquired into the activities relating to slush funds and other similar funds and entities established by, or related to, the affairs of these organisations. The Commissioner handed down his report in December 2015, finding \\"widespread and deep-seated\\" misconduct by union officials in Australia, and referring than 40 people and organisations to authorities, including police, Directors of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Fair Work Commission. The Final Report made a recommendation for the establishment of an independent body to investigate union records and finances was made, and was received by the Turnbull Government Northern Australia White Paper The Abbott Government sought to attract investment in northern Australia. In June 2015, it released the first ever White Paper on Developing Northern Australia. The Paper contained policy proposals for the development of the north as an \\"economic powerhous\\" over the next two decades, and examined new roads, studies of dam sites, changes to land-use laws as part of a development blueprint. Elements of the push for northern development included boosting links with the Asia-Pacific economies; a $600 million roads package; money to upgrade airstrips and explore rail freight options; a $100 million beef roads fund and a $5 billion concessional loans facility; a $200 million water infrastructure fund and a plan to study river systems for dams viability; support for native title bodies and new surveys to start simplifying land arrangements for economic investment; and a $75 million Cooperative Research Centre. Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper The Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper, released on 4 July 2015, outlined a $4 billion investment in Australian farmers and the competitiveness and profitability of the agriculture sector:http://agwhitepaper.agriculture.gov.au/about The Paper announced tax changes to assist farmers and encourage investment in water infrastructure and fencing, to mitigate droughts. It also includes money for roads and dam development, to assist in production and transport to markets; and five new agricultural trade counsellors help open up overseas markets. The Paper contained an $11.4 million boost to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), and the engagement of a new Agriculture Commissioner at the ACCC, to encourage fair-trading and strengthen competition in supply chains. The Paper added $300 million to the National Water Infrastructure Fund, established by the Northern Australia White Paper. 2014 Budget In May 2014, Joe Hockey delivered his first Federal Budget. Hockey told Parliament: \\"On the back of five budget deficits in a row we have inherited a further $123 billion of deficits and debt rising to $667 billion. This challenge is not of our making, but we, the women and men behind me, accept responsibility to fix it.\\"Federal budget 2014 ‚Äì Full speech; The Sydney Morning Herald Hockey outlined a number of proposed expenditure reductions, the abolition of the carbon and mining taxes, a Temporary Budget Repair Levy on high income earners, structural reforms to welfare and university education expenditure, the reintroduction of the fuel excise levy, and the establishment of a $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund, funded by the introduction of a $7 Medicare co-contribution. Hockey predicted, that if the measures were implemented, the budget deficit would fall from $49.9 billion to $29.8 billion over the next year. On Budget night, economist Chris Richardson told the ABC 7.30 programme that the Budget was \\"a solid start towards the planned surplus while it promises some political tussles ahead.\\"Budget 2014 represents 'genuinely solid start'; 7.30; 13 May 2015 Prior to the 2013 Election, Tony Abbott told SBS Television that there would be: \\"No cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS.\\" The Fairfax Press reported May that a number of Budget measures broke pre-election commitments and promises made by the Liberals in opposition. On 19 May, New Limited reported that \\"According to Newspoll, nearly half of voters said the measures will be lousy for the economy, and more than 60 per cent told a separate Nielsen survey the Budget was unfair.\\" A number of savings and revenue measures in the Budget were opposed by Labor, the Greens and cross benches in the Senate. In his Budget in reply speech, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said that Labor would oppose around $13 billion worth of cuts and tax hikes, including the changes to university funding.Budget 2014: Opposition Leader Bill Shorten says Labor will oppose around $13 billion worth of cuts; Australian Broadcasting Corporation Initially Labor joined the Greens in opposing the reintroduction of a fuel excise levy, delaying passage of the measure until June 2015.Petrol tax: Labor strikes deal with Government to revive twice-yearly hike in fuel excise; Australian Broadcasting Corporation; 23 June 2015 Labor and the Greens opposed the Coalition's promised abolition of carbon pricing, and the introduction of \\"direct action\\" carbon-reduction policies, but the Government secured cross bench support for the repeal of the tax in July 2014. Labor and the Greens opposed abolition of the Rudd-Gillard mining tax, but it was repealed with the support of the Palmer United Party in September. The Government was unable to secure passage of its expanded Paid Parental Leave Scheme, or medicare co-contribution and the measures were scrapped. Education Minister Christopher Pyne continues to negotiate for passage of university funding reforms, but the measures are not supported by the Opposition and minor parties. This budget has been described as \\"the beginning of the end\\" for the Abbott Government. 2015 Budget In his 2015 Budget Speech, Hockey said: \\"On the economic front, iron ore prices have fallen dramatically and the recovery in the global economy has been weaker than expected. But I say to you, the economic plan laid down by this government more than a year ago, is in place and it is helping us to deal with these challenges.\\" Hockey proposed significant new small business tax concessions, and said the government would increase funding for development of Australia's north, drought assistance, jobseeker assistance, national security and medical research. The GST was to be revised to include digital purchases The ABC reported that Hockey's second budget would see a $35 billion deficit for 2015‚Äì16, with a fall to $7 billion by 2018‚Äì19. The ABC noted that Hockey had pledged $5.5 billion for small businesses and that small business would receive a 100% tax write off for assets costing less than $20,000. A crackdown on welfare fraud would bring in $1.7 billion over forward estimates, and the fight against ISIS would receive better funding. =Financial services policy= The Abbott government refused calls for a royal commission into financial planner misconduct at the Commonwealth Bank (one of the largest financial service providers in Australia) after a senate committee review into the matter found gross exploitation of bank customers. The government, which favours deregulation, intends to remove customer protections in the sector; allow advisers to earn sales commission and other so-called \\"conflicted remuneration\\" from providing general financial advice; and remove the requirement for financial advisers to tell customers how much they are receiving in commissions every year and give them the chance to opt out of the arrangements every second year. This was in addition to removing the laws that require financial advisers to act in the best interest of their clients, and the requirement that they provide clients with a statement of the fees they'll be charged each year. =Social policy= Adoption In December 2013, Abbott launched a taskforce to help make it easier for Australians to permanently adopt children. He made the announcement flanked by NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell and actors Hugh Jackman and Deborra-Lee Furness, who supported the process.Tony Abbott announces adoption taskforce, backed by Furness, Jackman; The Australian, 19 December 2013. Parental leave scheme At the 2013 election, Abbott proposed a plan for $5.5 billion paid parental leave scheme to provide parents with 26 weeks' paid leave, at full replacement wage up to an annual salary of $150,000 (or a maximum of $75,000) ‚Äì or the minimum wage if greater. The wage replacement strategy was designed to be an economic driver and boost female workforce participation rates and was intended to replace the Gillard government's $1.8 billion scheme, introduced in January 2011. Same sex marriage In opposition, Abbott's Coalition had voted against a same-sex marriage bill put to the Parliament, but in office Abbott indicated that, while he personally opposed redefinition of marriage, if a bill were to come before the new parliament, the Coalition party room would discuss its stance on the issue. In Government, Abbott reaffirmed that he did not support changing the law to recognise same-sex marriages. Attorney General George Brandis challenged the ACT Legislative Assembly's unilateral recognition of same-sex marriage as being inconsistent with the Federal Marriage Act and therefore unconstitutional, a view which was upheld by the High Court on 12 December 2013. Abbott permitted Coalition members to advocate for change if they felt strongly on the issue, and indicated that if a bill were to come before the new parliament, the Coalition party room would discuss its stance on the issue. Opinion polls suggested growing support for change, and on 11 August 2015, Abbott called a Coalition Party room vote and MPs voted against allowing a free vote on the issue 66 to 33. Abbott was criticised by some pro-gay marriage Liberal MPs for holding the vote in the Coalition party room, rather than the Liberal party room. To settle the issue, Abbott proposed a plebiscite following the next election. Disaster recovery assistance One day after the 2013 New South Wales bushfires destroyed 200 homes in the Blue Mountains to the west of Sydney, the government eased the criteria for receipt of the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment, removing financial assistance for evacuees. =Immigration= Scott Morrison was appointed Minister for Immigration and Border Protection in the Abbott Ministry. In opposition, the Coalition had been highly critical of the Labor government's Asylum Seeker policies. Campaigning for office, Morrison said that the Coalition \\"has always believed in immigration as one of the great nation building planks of policy\\" and that it would undertake measures to restore confidence in Australia's immigration program. The Abbott-led opposition had opposed the Labor government's tightening of restrictions on 457 \\"skilled migrant\\" visas, and pledged that in government, it would repeal the law and issue more 457 visas, to stimulate economic growth. Refugees In 2014, Australia took in 11,570 refugees from offshore, mostly through the UNHCR program, which was 11% of the global figure within the Third country resettlement category. For Third country resettlement refugees, this ranked Australia as the recipient of the third highest figure overall, and first on a per-capita basis. For total refugees, this ranked Australia 22nd overall and 28th on a per-capita basis. In 2015, the Abbott Government had been pursuing a policy of increasing its refugee intake from 13,750 people to 18,750 by 2018, but the worsening Syrian Civil War refugee crisis, led Abbott to announce an additional intake of 12,000 places for people escaping that conflict. The Government also committed to $44 million in financial aid to prepare camps for the northern winter. Abbott lost office in September, and the Turnbull Government inherited the plan. Asylum seekers Immigration detention population to December 2014 In Opposition, Tony Abbott promised that his government would \\"stop the boats\\" within his first term of Government. Abbott had been highly critical of Labor's handling of Asylum Seeker policy, and the re-emergence of the people smuggling trade which followed the dismantling of Howard Government policies. Scott Morrison was tasked with managing the government's efforts at stemming the flow of deaths at sea, and unauthorised boat arrivals. In April 2015, ABC Fact Check reported that Abbott's promise to stop the boats had been delivered: \\"The Government launched Operation Sovereign Borders on 18 September 2013, when it took office. Boats continued to arrive for the remainder of 2013, at a rate of five to seven per month. The picture changed in January 2014. Since then only one boat, carrying 157 asylum seekers, has arrived.\\" Labor had abandoned offshore processing in 2008, but reintroduced the policy shortly before losing office. An analysis by former Immigration Department chief John Menadue and Australian National University migration expert Peter Hughes regards the downturn in boat arrivals to have begun after the Second Rudd Government announcement that asylum seekers would not be settled in Australia, and other measures undertaken by the Rudd Government to resettle refugees elsewhere. In July 2015, the Labor Opposition voted to abandon its opposition to the Abbott government's \\"turn-back-the-boats\\" policy. Immigration spokesman said the Party also needed the \\"full suite of measures to stop deaths at sea and end people smuggling.\\" ; Operation Sovereign Borders On the day it was sworn in, the Abbott Government launched Operation Sovereign Borders, a joint agency task force designed to combat people smuggling. Deputy Chief of Army, Angus Campbell was appointed to lead the effort. The government instituted a policy of turning-back-boats where it was safe to do so, and sent arrivals to offshore processing centres. From January 2014, until the demise of the Abbott Government in September 2015, only one asylum vessel was reported to have reached Australia. In December 2014 the Abbott government passed the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014 (Cth) giving the immigration minister unprecedented powers to control the lives of asylum seekers. The Immigration Minister told a Senate inquiry in January 2014 that sharing of information about \\"on-water\\" tactics and intelligence should be limited in the interest of national security. That month, no new boat arrivals were recorded for the first time since the election of the Abbott Government. On 14 January 2014, Morrison announced the closure of four mainland detention centres. On 4 February 2014, he said that no asylum seeker boats had reached Australia for 36 days, which was the longest stretch in almost five years. \\"This is the longest period of no illegal boat arrivals since March of 2009, when arrivals first started to significantly escalate as a consequence of the former Labor Government's decision to abolish the strong border protection regime they inherited from the Howard Government\\", Morrison told reporters. The government apologised to Indonesia after Australian Navy ships performing border protection tasks entered the country's waters on six occasions during December 2013 and January 2014. The incidents led to a deterioration in the relationship between the Australian Defence Force and the Indonesian National Armed Forces. ; Detention Centres On 17 February 2014 there was a riot in the Manus Island detention centre. The riot occurred amid concerns by asylum seekers in detention that their claims were not being processed. The Australian reported that asylum claims were being processed in the lead up to the Manus Island riots. It has since been reported that no such processing was occurring. The BBC reported in December 2014 that \\"Rights group say conditions in the PNG and Nauru camps are totally inadequate, citing poor hygiene, cramped conditions, unrelenting heat and a lack of facilities. They say these conditions are causing physical and mental health issues among detainees\\" and that \\"Two young Iranian men have died as a direct result of their detention in PNG.\\" In response to a February 2015 Human Rights Commission report critical of conditions for children in detention, Abbott said \\"The most compassionate thing you can do is stop the boats. We have stopped the boats\\" and criticised the Commissioner for not investigating the issue under Labor, when hundreds of people were dying at sea and 2000 children were in detention. The detention figure had reduced to 211 under the Abbott Government. ; Sri Lankan and Indian vessels In June/July 2014, reports emerged that two boats, carrying presumed Sri Lankan asylum seekers, had been intercepted in the waters between Sri Lanka and Australia. On 7 July, the Immigration Minister confirmed to the High Court that 41 asylum seekers on a boat intercepted west of the Cocos Islands had been returned to Sri Lanka, following an \\"enhanced screening process\\" at sea. Plaintiffs sought an injunction on the transfer of a further 153 asylum seekers from. The Government told the High Court there remained 157 asylum seekers, who were on an Indian flagged vessel that had departed from Pondicherry, India. These asylum seekers were transferred from Cocos Islands to Western Australia to be granted access to Indian consular officials. The Government said that when these asylum seekers \\"refused to meet Indian consular officials, who were to establish their identities and residency status\\", they were transferred to Nauru. The return of Tamil asylum seekers to Sri Lanka was controversial, as the Australian government had previously described Sri Lanka as \\"responsible for government-sponsored torture, abuse and mistreatment by police and security forces\\". In the government's first year they spent $120,000 on domestic media monitoring on immigration and asylum seekers in the face of criticism for being an overtly secretive area of government. =Infrastructure= In the 2013 election campaign, Abbott said he wanted to be known as an \\"infrastructure prime minister\\". In his first Budget, Joe Hockey announced \\"Over the next six years, the government will help build new roads, rail, ports and airports\\" and outlined spending commitments to the East West Link in Melbourne, the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing; the Perth Freight Link; the Midlands Highway upgrade in Tasmania and the North South Road Corridor project in Adelaide and said: \\"our $1 billion National Stronger Regions Fund, together with $200 million of new Black Spot funding, and $350 million extra for Roads to Recovery will deliver jobs and better roads across regional and rural Australia.\\"Federal budget 2014 ‚Äì Full speech; Joe Hockey; The Sydney Morning Herald; 13 May 2014 In May 2015, the Abbott Government released the Australian Infrastructure Audit. In his 2015 Budget speech, Hockey announced the reintroduction of Fuel Indexation to assist with funding of road-building and said: \\"We are rolling out the biggest infrastructure program in Australia's history, with new road and freight corridors being built right across the country\\".Federal budget 2015 ‚Äì Full speech; Joe Hockey; The Sydney Morning Herald; 13 May 2014 ; Transport investment In opposition, Abbott had called for less investment in \\"inefficient, over-manned, union- dominated, government-run train and bus systems\\", because \\"cars facilitated a sense of personal mastery public transport never would\\", saying \\"The humblest person is king in his own car.\\" In office, Abbott withdrew some funding for planned public transport projects. On 19 September 2013, Abbott joined NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell to jointly launch the WestConnex motorway for Sydney. In Victoria, Abbott supported construction of the East West Link in Melbourne. The Age reported that the timing of the provision of funds for the East West Link, the last day of the 2013‚Äì14 financial year, was criticised by federal Auditor-General Grant Hehir as a strategy to artificially blow out the deficit of the outgoing government. ; Second Sydney airport On 15 April 2014, the Abbott government announced approval for a second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek, west of Sydney's CBD, and to develop accompanying integrated infrastructure. The announcement of the A$2.5 billion project ended years of uncertainty over the site, which had been purchased by the Hawke Government. Abbott predicted that the project would create 60,000 new jobs for Western Sydney by the time the airport was fully operational. =Science= The first Abbott ministry divided responsilbilities for science between the portfolios of Education, under Christopher Pyne, and Industry, under Ian McFarlane. This was reported as the first ministry since 1931 to be without a dedicated Minister for Science. This drew criticism from scientific organisations including the Australian Academy of Science. The December 2014 Cabinet reshuffle saw the title Science restored, under Ian McFarlane's Ministry of Industry and Science. In the 2014 Budget, Joe Hockey announced a commitment to build the $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund, to boost funding for medical research.Medical Research Future Fund finally gets Senate approval; The Australian; 13 August 2015 However, the Budget was criticised for its $450 million reduction in funding for science agencies. =Media and Communications= Malcolm Turnbull took up the role of Minister for Communications following the election of the Abbott Government. On 14 September 2015, Turnbull resigned the position to challenge Abbott's leadership of the Liberal Party. National Broadband Network Tony Abbott, as Leader of the Opposition, and Malcolm Turnbull, as Shadow Minister for Communications and Broadband, stated in 2010 that in government they would 'demolish' the NBN.Emma Rodgers, (14 September 2010), Abbott orders Turnbull to demolish NBN, ABC News. Retrieved 12 February 2017AAP, (14 September 2010), Turnbull back to 'demolish' NBN, Sydney Morning Herald. Retrieved 29 July 2010 In opposition, the Abbott-led Coalition was critical of the Labor government's National Broadband Network policy, and proposed to deliver \\"a cheaper version, more efficiently\\", by funding a technologically inferior fibre to the node network, rather than Labor's primarily fibre to the premises network. In opposition, the Coalition promised their alternative would deliver a minimum 25 Mbit/s to 100% of premises by 2016 and a minimum 50 Mbit/s to 100% of premises by 2019, requiring peak funding of $29.5bn. This compared to the previous government's NBN target of 100Mbit/s to 93% of premises by 2021 and 25Mbit/s to the remaining 7% of premises by 2016, with peak funding of $44bn. Social media activists attacked the Coalition's plan, describing it as \\"fraudband\\". Following the 2013 election, Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull assumed responsibility for management of the network, and invited the Labor appointed board of NBN Co to offer their resignations and announced a strategic review of the project. The review found that the Coalition's NBN would require funding of $41bn (up from $29.5bn) and that 44% of premises would receive 25Mbit/s by 2016 (down from 100%). Turnbull, a former Rhodes Scholar and successful businessman, had previously worked in the field of internet communications, being a co-founder of OzEmail. On 15 December 2014, the government announced that it had struck a deal with the nation's largest telecommunications provider, Telstra, to gradually acquire Telstra's copper fixed-line network for a total cost of A$11 billion. The government was able to effectively re-negotiate the former government's NBN deal with Telstra, at no additional cost to taxpayers. Media relations ; Fairfax Press and Abbott Government On 1 September 2015, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said Fairfax Media were conducting \\"a bit of a jihad\\" against the Government, and that there was a \\"huge move by Fairfax at the moment to try and bring the Government down...[and Fairfax is] being helped by the ABC\\".Fairfax leading jihad to bring down Abbott Government, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton says; ABC; 1 September 2015 In May 2015, Fairfax political correspondent Peter Hartcher had made allegations against Tony Abbott, claiming falsely that he had snubbed the gay partner of an ambassador in Paris.

In the 7 months following his taking of the Liberal leadership, Turnbull conducted 17 interviews at the ABC, and boycotted 2GB Radio.PM MIA on 2GB; Media Watch; ABC; 10 April 2016 =Environment= Greg Hunt was appointed Minister for the Environment. Hunt, a former Fulbright scholar, and human rights and development activist with the United Nations, had held the Shadow portfolio under successive Liberal leaders. The portfolio of Climate Change was abolished. The Abbottled Opposition campaigned on a promise of replacing the Rudd-Gillard Government's carbon pricing system with a \\"direct action against climate change\\" policy. In July 2014, the Abbott Government followed through with this commitment, becoming the first developed nation to repeal a carbon price and foregoing government revenue of $24 billion from polluters through to 2020. Prior to becoming Opposition Leader, Abbott initially supported proposals by Liberal leaders Howard and Turnbull to introduce floating prices to reduce carbon emissions, but also expressed some doubts as to the science and economics underlying such initiatives. On the eve of the 2013 election, Abbott stated during an interview on the ABC TV Insiders that: On 19 September, Hunt abolished the advisory Climate Commission, stating that this move formed \\"part of the Coalition's plans to streamline government processes and avoid duplication of services\\" and that the Department of the Environment would take on its role. Hunt has also stated that the government will abolish the Climate Change Authority and Clean Energy Finance Corporation. In October Abbott and Hunt disputed statements from Christiana Figueres, the head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, that the 2013 New South Wales bushfires were probably linked to climate change and that the government's Direct Action policy would be harmful, with Abbott stating that Figueres was \\"talking through her hat\\". In November 2013, the Abbott government made a decision not to send a ministerial delegate to the 2013 Warsaw climate summit. Days later the Abbott government abandoned its longstanding policy to cut emissions by between 5% and 25% of 2000 levels by 2020, stating that the Coalition would only commit to a 5% emissions reduction target. In December 2013 Environment Minister Greg Hunt controversially approved the dumping of three million cubic metres of dredge spoil in the Great Barrier Marine Park. In the same month the Abbott government defunded Environment Defenders Offices across Australia. In January 2014, Environment Minister Greg Hunt cleared the way for a controversial shark cull in Western Australia by exempting it from federal legislation designed to protect threatened species, while Tony Abbott announced plans to again study the supposed health impacts of wind farms, before the public release of a survey of scientific literature on the issue. The 2014 Budget proposed to scrap the Australian Renewable Energy Agency which the Coalition repeatedly promised to retain in the lead up to the 2013 Federal Election, dumped the election promise for Million Solar Roofs, cut $484 million from Landcare and the Caring for Our Country programs, provided $1.5 billion for the East-West Link freeway and axed the National Water Commission. Following on from its decision to fund the Environment Defenders Office, in June 2014 the federal Liberal Party unanimously endorsed a proposal to strip charity status from environmental groups including the Wilderness Society, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Bob Brown Foundation. The same month the Abbott government lost a bid to have part of Tasmania's World Heritage forest de-listed from UNESCO's World Heritage programme, after declaring Australia had too much 'locked up' forest and that loggers were the 'ultimate conservationists'. Legislation to implement the Emissions Reduction Fund came into effect on 13 December 2014 In 2015, the Abbott government: * Attempted to bring climate contrarian Bjorn Lomborg to the University of Western Australia with a $4 million grant * Moved to prevent the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation from backing wind energy and household solar projects. * Cut the Howard government's Renewable Energy Target and included a provision to include native wood waste as a renewable fuel source Documents obtained with a Freedom of Information request show that the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet proposed an investigation into the Bureau of Meteorology to address claims in The Australian that the BoM was exaggerating global warming. Environment Minister Greg Hunt argued against the investigation, instead setting up a review forum which found that the Bureau of Meteorology data were accurate. =Biosecurity= The Biosecurity Bill 2014 passed through parliament on 14 May 2015 with bipartisan support, as possibly \\"one of the most substantial and significant pieces of legislation to pass through Parliament during the term of the [Abbott] Government\\", seven years from its instigation following the 2008 Beale Review. It had been introduced by Labor's Gillard government government in 2012. The Biosecurity Act 2015 was a major reform of the Quarantine Act, in particular in its strengthening and modernising the existing framework of regulations governing biosecurity in Australia. =Health= Sussan Ley took over as Minister for Health from Peter Dutton in December 2014 Following the election of the Abbott Government, Peter Dutton became Minister for Health and Sport, the latter portfolio being elevated to Cabinet for the first time. In December 2014, Sussan Ley took over as Minister for Health and Sport. The Abbott Government was elected in the early stages of implementation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which had been introduced by Julia Gillard, and for which the Coalition had offered bi-partisan support. The Government proposed the introduction of a $7 co-payment for GP visits to permanently augment funding of Medicare and establish a medical research fund to work towards curing cancer and dementia. The funding proposal failed to pass the Senate, but the Medical Research Future Fund was established in 2015. In its first term, the Abbott Government ceased a $5 million annual grant to the Australian Red Cross established under the Howard Government. When Scott Morrison became Social Services Minister, he proposed a crackdown on Disability Support Pensions to fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme. 61 Medicare Locals were replaced with 31 Primary Health Networks. The 2014 Budget reduced the Commonwealth's share of hospital funding by A$15 billion by 2024, with the majority of the cuts beginning in 2017, despite a pre-election commitment of no cuts to health. The Government raised $5.68 billion selling shares of Medibank Private. Co-payment and Medical Research Future Fund In his 2014 Budget Speech, Joe Hockey announced a commitment to build the $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund, in addition to existing funding through the National Health and Medical Research Council. Hockey predicted that the fund would, \\"within six years, be the biggest medical research endowment fund in the world\\" and announced that \\"all the savings from the introduction of a $7 Medicare co-contribution, modest changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and other responsible changes in this Health Budget\\" would be directed to the fund until it reaches $20 billion. The $7 co-payment was to be for general practitioner (GP) visits and clinical pathology. Proceeds from the co-payment were to go towards a medical research fund. Since the announcement there has been a collapse in private medical research donations for medical research. It later emerged that the government had failed to model the impacts of the new GP fee including the impacts on hospital emergency room waiting times and medical research. The Senate blocked passage of the medical co-payment, but approved the establishment of the Medical Research Future Fund in August 2015, with funding to be found through reduced health spending and the Health and Hospitals Fund, until a balance of $20bn is reached in 2020. The Fund is managed by the Future Fund, with interest generated going to medical research, beginning with $10 million in 2015, growing to $390m over the following three years. Vaccination campaign In April 2015, the Government announced the \\"no- jab, no pay\\" welfare reform to improve vaccination rates among minors for preventable diseases.Australia to stop welfare cash of anti-vaccine parents; BBC News; 12 April 2015 The Abbott government initiative, which denies childcare rebate and family tax benefit A to parents who refuse to vaccinate their children resulted in \\"conscientious objector\\" numbers falling from 39,523 in December 2014 to 30,092 in December 2015, ahead of the commencement of the law.Claire Harvey: Saving babies is one legacy of Tony Abbott that nobody can jab at; Claire Harvey; The Daily Telegraph; 20 March 2016 =Education= Christopher Pyne was appointed as Minister for Education. He assumed the education portfolio during the early stages of implementation of the school funding reforms inspired by the Gonski review, and introduced by the Gillard-Rudd Governments, for which the Abbott led Opposition had pledged to match the Labor government's proposed funding for the next four years in August 2013 after initially opposing the measures. On 24 November 2013 Pyne announced that the Government was reviewing all aspects of the Gonski funding agreements on the grounds that they were \\"a shambles and quite unimplementable\\", and inferior to the model in place under the Howard Government. Following protests from the state governments that had signed funding agreements, Abbott announced on 2 December that the government would still provide the funding that the Labor government had committed to over a four-year period, but the states would no longer be required to raise their funding or make other reforms, on the grounds that the government did not want to \\"try to run public schools out of Canberra\\". In the 2014 budget, the Abbott government set aside $245 million for religious chaplains in schools. Secular schools were stripped of the option of hiring a secular equivalent, as they had been allowed to do under previous funding arrangements. Furthermore, taxpayers would subsidise the training of priests and other religious workers at private colleges for the first time under the Abbott government's proposed higher education reforms. In 2014 it was announced that religious teaching, training and vocational institutes would be eligible for a share of $820 million in new Commonwealth funding over three years. New Colombo Plan The New Colombo Plan was launched as a signature initiative of the Abbott government's foreign policy, and was aimed at enhancing the knowledge of the Indo-Pacific in Australia, by supporting Australian undergraduates studying and undertaking internships in the region.Tony Abbott launches 'New Colombo Plan' for Australian students to study in India; The Economic Times; 4 September 2014 In 2014, the pilot scheme supported 40 scholars and more than 1300 mobility students to study and undertake work placements. In 2015 the Scheme expanded further across the Indo-Pacific, awarding 69 scholarships and supporting more than 3,100 mobility students. The scheme was continued by the Turnbull Government.About the New Colombo Plan; dfat.gov.au 50px This content is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia license. University and TAFE deregulation The Abbott government proposed in the 2014 budget the deregulation of universities and TAFEs. Furthermore, the amount of public funding for university courses will be reduced by 20% and expose students to big increases in their student debts with the removal of all caps on the fees universities can charge. Student debts will be compounded at the 10-year bond rate with a cap at 6% (it has historically been typically above 6%) instead of the consumer price index. Total government higher education funding is projected to be $9.5 billion by 2017‚Äì18. While this is a nominal increase of $750 million compared with 2012‚Äì13, analysis by The Guardian Australia shows it represents a cut of about $1.5 billion in real terms when population growth and inflation are taken into account. The government then claimed that removing the upper limit on university fees will cause fees to decrease. This contradicts the designer of the HECS system, Bruce Chapman, who has warned student debts will triple. =Freedom of information= The government moved to abolish the role of Freedom of Information Commissioner, abolish the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and charge $800 for reviews of \\"freedom of information\\" request denials.  2015 Abbott leadership loss  =Leaks against Abbott= The Abbott government was afflicted by leaks publicising policy divisions over national security and social policy.http://www.themercury.com.au/news/politics/federal-employment-minister- eric-abetz-attacks-loose-lipped-colleagues-over-cabinet-leaks/news- story/8c86f2dc23d4f49b8172fe4014984d96 In 2014, leaked discussions about the Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 disaster in Ukraine had claimed Abbott wanted to send 1000 Australian soldiers to secure the site, but cabinet colleagues, including Foreign Minister Bishop talked him out of it. In January, a leak claimed Abbott ignored the advice of Treasurer Hockey and Health Minister Dutton to cut the Medicare rebate by $20, and in February a leak from the expenditure review committee claimed Abbott and his Chief of Staff were at odds with Ministers over the \\"earn or learn\\" welfare reform.http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/war-in-pm-tony-abbotts- cabinet-over-six-month-wait-for-the-dole/news- story/6e7b4d5cae504d60713ada6ec5334be9 =First leadership challenge= In February 2015, Liberal MPs Don Randall and Luke Simpkins called a February 2015 spill motion to spill the leadership positions of the party, though with no contender.

The ABC reported that in the lead up to the motion, the Abbott Government had been facing \\"leaks and growing media criticism\\", when Abbott earned the \\"ire of his colleagues and the derision of many Australians by appointing Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, as a Knight of the Order of Australia\\", and that the defeat of the Liberal National Party government of Campbell Newman had also disheartened the Coalition. On 5 February, Fairfax had reported that leadership speculation was at \\"fever pitch\\" after backbench Senator Arthur Sinodinos questioned Abbott's judgement on Sky News and refused to confirm if the Prime Minister would still hold his job in a week's time.Leadership speculation at fever pitch as Arthur Sinodinos calls PM's judgment into question; 5 February 2015 The following day, the ABC's 7.30 reported that \\"The tensions between the Prime Minister and the colleagues campaigning to oust him are heading to a showdown.\\"Two WA backbenchers call for a spill against Prime Minister Tony Abbott; ABC; 7.30, Transcript 6 February 2015 In the months after the failed spill motion, leaking and backgrounding against Abbott continued, but polling for the Coalition initially improved.http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/politics- news/newspoll-tony-abbott-rallies-coalition-at-four-month-high/story- fn59nqld-1227236213786?sv=fa1178e8bb0e42addf4c83dee6420914 Following the Second Hockey Budget in May 2015, Newspoll placed Abbott's approval rating at an eight-month high, and in front of Bill Shorten as better prime minister for the first time in six months.http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national- affairs/newspoll-budget-win-for-voters-economy-and-tony-abbott/story- fn59niix-1227358285115?sv=6f9ce0f2860459dd969853b9c6cc94f =Further leaks= ; National security leaks In February 2015, Abbott was hit by leaks criticising his interventions to attempt to save Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan from the death penalty in Indonesia, and claiming that he had come up with a plan to \\"unilaterally invade Iraq\\" with a force of more than 3000 Australian troops to take on Islamic State forces.

Hartcher wrote: \\"As a member of the Abbott cabinet, Malcolm Turnbull is obliged to keep any criticisms of the government's performance to himself. Unless, of course, it's in the confidentiality of the cabinet room itself\\", before quoting Turnbull and other Ministers at length in their criticisms of a national security policy proposal. ; Cabinet cohesion Following the citizenship leak, a leak emerged that Abbott had warned his cabinet against leaks. Julie Bishop and Malcolm Turnbull denied being the source of the leaks, and Joe Hockey was not in the room. Later, an internal four-page briefing document from the Prime Minister's office was leaked, revealing a strategy to attack the opposition as indecisive over anti-terror legislation. Bret Walker suggested the proposed changes would be unconstitutional. In August, \\"talking points\\" briefing papers from the PMO advising Ministers to tell the media that \\"our cabinet is functioning exceptionally well,\\" were leaked to Fairfax. The Herald reported: \\"Thursday's breach of confidentiality is the latest in a rolling series of leaks that have hit the government this week, including Monday night's threadbare cabinet agenda to the Seven Network and the Guardian Australia, details of Tuesday's party room meeting and Wednesday's morning note\\" =Second leadership challenge= Successful Liberal leadership challenger Malcolm Turnbull defeated the incumbent with 54 votes to 44. On 14 September 2015, Turnbull announced that he would be challenging Abbott. Turnbull cited Newspoll results and a need for a new style of \\"economic leadership\\" as reasons for mounting his challenge: \\"We have lost 30 Newspolls in a row. It is clear that the people have made up their mind about Mr Abbott's leadership,\\" he said. In response, Abbott said that he was \\"dismayed by the destabilisation that's been taking place now for many, many months\\" and that Australia needed \\"strong and stable Government and that means avoiding, at all costs, Labor's revolving-door prime ministership.\\"; Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 14 September 2015 A September 2015 leadership spill was called, with Turnbull challenging Abbott, and winning by 54 votes to 44, and Abbott supporter Kevin Andrews challenging Julie Bishop and losing 70‚Äì30. Aftermath Turnbull dropped Abbott, Hockey, Eric Abetz, Ian Macfarlane, Kevin Andrews, Michael Ronaldson and Bruce Billson from his ministry, but increased the number of cabinet ministers from 19 to 21. Abbott returned to the backbench, while Julie Bishop remained Deputy Liberal leader and Foreign Minister in the Turnbull Government. Scott Morrison became Turnbull's Treasurer, and Immigration Minister Dutton, an Abbott supporter, retained his post. Polling was initially favourable to Turnbull following the leadership change, but the Coalition faced internal tensions as a result of the change. In a final address to the media as Prime Minister, Abbott expressed pride in the record of his government, but warned against a \\"poll-driven\\" political culture and unnamed media figures and politicians who would \\"connive at dishonour\\" by spreading anonymous, self-serving claims: \\"A febrile media culture has developed that rewards treachery\\" he said. In early December 2015, Abbott said he would not make a decision on his political future until April 2016. Immigration Minister Dutton was excluded from the National Security Committee of Cabinet, reportedly over tensions between himself and Turnbull. In November, Fairfax reported: \\"Simmering tensions over the September leadership coup have flared up amid revelations Julie Bishop's chief of staff attended the meeting of Liberal MPs plotting against Tony Abbott on the night before the spill\\" as Abetz and Dutton called on Bishop to explain. Former ministers Abetz and Andrews expressed some discontent at government direction, while Bruce Billson announced his retirement and Ian McFarlane ‚Äì with the support of Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss ‚Äì attempted to switch to the National Party, but the move was blocked by the Liberals. Hockey's seat of North Sydney went to a by-election, which saw a 12.84% swing against the Liberal Party. From the back bench, Abbott continued his commentary on the record of his government and on world affairs, particularly in relation to national security and the challenge posed by Islamist terrorism. Media critics accused Abbott of \\"sniping\\". Amid the deteriorating Syrian Civil War and following Germany's decision to open its borders to large numbers of asylum seekers, Abbott delivered the Margaret Thatcher Lecture in London on 28 October, and urged Europe to look to the Australian example of border management, and for the international community to do more to resolve the Syrian conflict.Transcript: Tony Abbott's controversial speech at the Margaret Thatcher Lecture; The Sydney Morning Herald; 28 October 2015 Turnbull did not endorse Abbott's view.http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national- affairs/opinion/turnbull-has-no-desire-to-give-advice-to-merkel-on- refugees/story-e6frgd0x-1227608670036?sv=d5009f348ec9c393ff82f1920f1098f2 Following the subsequent November 2015 Paris attacks by IS sympathisers, Turnbull said a political solution, not a military invasion was needed for Syria.

The work revolves around two main characters: Elaine Lim, a Science physics teacher, and her father Lim Chong Boon, a former professor ridden with health problems (stroke). Originally developed at the Playwrights' Cove at The Necessary Stage in 2001, Everything but the Brain was first performed in 2005. The play won Best Original Script (for Tay) and Best Actor (for Gerald Chew as the father) at The Straits Times Life! Theatre Awards 2006 and was published in book form by Epigram Books in 2010. In 2014, the play was selected by the Ministry of Education (Singapore) as a recommended 'O' and 'N' level literature text. Characters * Elaine Lim: An unmarried, 36-year-old teacher specialising in Physics. * Lim Chong Boon: A 66-year-old former professor in Physics and Elaine's father. * Dr. Samuel Chen: A neurologist in his late twenties. * Chorus A: A nameless bear who primarily narrates most of the play's events. * Chorus B: A nameless bear and Chorus A's partner. * Chorus C: A nameless bear and Chorus A's partner. Plot 36-year-old Physics teacher Elaine Lim attempts to reverse time using the Theory of Relativity in order to save her dying father, 66-year-old Lim Chong Boon, regarded as a genius in Physics and now a retired professor. Recalling a childhood moment told to her by her father, Elaine theorises that she can stop the effects of his recent transient ischemic attack by taking him on a train travelling close to light's speed. At the hospital during her father's check-up, she gets attracted to the neurologist in charge, 27-year-old Dr. Samuel Chen, and their relationship strengthens over a few more visits. Elaine takes a year-long leave from school. Chong Boon suffers a more serious stroke while recovering from his first mild attack, and becomes more paralysed. Elaine reminisces her childhood years, when her obsessive-compulsive Malaysian mother was still alive. With not much time left to spare, Elaine decides to treasure every moment with her father, becoming his personal, round-the-clock nurse. Just as Samuel and Elaine's relationship become romantic, she finds out that he was actually her former student. Samuel awkwardly leaves and shortly after, Chong Boon suffers his third and final stroke. Per her father's wishes, Elaine lays his body to rest, but retains his brain as a sentimental item. Performance history Everything but the Brain was first performed in 2005 under the helm of Krishen Jit. In 2010, Samantha Scott-Blackhall revisited the play and in 2013, Derrick Chew directed the third remake of the play.

Opened in 1896 as the Grand Hotel Royal, a hub for the elite of 19th century society, the hotel has undergone extensive modification throughout the 20th century, and has in the 21st century been restored and reopened as the Corinthia.  Historical background  The course of the Grand Boulevard (Nagyk√∂r√∫t) was marked out during the 1870s together with Andr√°ssy Avenue, Budapest's most impressive avenue. The road went through a thinly populated part of suburban Budapest, so its development was rather slow, and only a few buildings were constructed in the 1870s. The real development of the Grand Boulevard began once Andr√°ssy Street was completed in 1884.  Grand Hotel Royal  The Grand Hotel Royal was originally opened for visitors of the Millennium Exhibition in 1896. A joint-stock company, established by the hotel owners, including the chairman Mr. Frigyes Gl√ºck and the planner architect Mr. Rezs≈ë Ray, had succeeded in purchasing the largest piece of real estate on the developing Grand Boulevard. By this time the Grand Boulevard had become the main artery of the capital city and the hotel rooms enjoyed superb views of this most attractive part of Budapest. The official opening ceremony was on 30 April 1896. The hotel comprised 350 guest rooms, including the adjacent building and attic rooms for the staff. The architectural style was French renaissance and the latest technology was used throughout. Besides the facilities (post office, bank, hairdresser, ticket office) guests and the public had access to two restaurants, a caf√©, a Gerbeaud confectionery and private dining rooms. In the cellar could be found not only a grocery store but also a bar. In the western cour d'honneur, a palm garden made the court more attractive. After its opening, the Royal became popular, a regular haunt of contemporary Hungarian writers and journalists, including Jen≈ë Heltay, S√°ndor Hunyadi, Lajos Nagy and Gyula Kr√∫dy. The first screening in Budapest of a motion picture by the Lumi√©re brothers also took place at the hotel and later became highly successful as a regular exhibition. Several classical concerts were held in the Royal Ballroom, and B√©la Bart√≥k, the Hungarian composer, frequently conducted music there. The Royal soon became a topic of journalists. In 1909, the first Hungarian airplane was exhibited in one of the hotel's cours d'honneur. With the growing popularity of the motion picture, the Ballroom ceased to exist as a part of the hotel and was reconstructed as the Royal Apollo cinema. After the Second World War, it reopened its doors in 1959 as the Red Star cinema with its entrance on H√°rsfa Street.  Decline, fall and rise  From the Second World War until 1953 the Royal served not as a hotel but as an office building. In 1953 the building was restored to become a hotel, but three years later the roof was destroyed by fire. This unfortunate event forced the architects to reconstruct the whole building. The Royal was intended to be a hotel representative of the age, since none of today's hotels on the Danube bank had been established yet. Istv√°n Jan√°ky, architect of the reconstruction, reconsidered the building's interior with the 'space idealism' of his age. Today, no remaining fragments of the original interior can be found. The demolition and reconstruction in 1956 destroyed every trace. In 1961 the Royal was re-opened as a hotel, with 367 guest rooms. Over the years the hotel became obsolete and finally, it was closed in the autumn of 1991, although the cinema continued working until the autumn of 1997. The original visitor's book contains the signatures of some of the most important people from Europe and the rest of the world. Just a few examples are Max Reinhardt, Asta Nilsen, Saljapin, Valdemar Psylander, Professor Barnard, Roberto Benzi, Mario del Monaco, Anna Moffo, Renata Scotto, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Amerigo Tot, Valentina Tereskova.  Royal Spa  The spa was planned and built by the architect Vilmos Freund in 1886‚Äì88. At that time it contained steam baths, wave and shower baths, electric baths, pneumatic chamber and a medical room with cold water. Contemporary journalists were fascinated by the spa's appearance. In 1903 direct access was created for hotel guests. After the First World War, Freund was declared bankrupt and his heirs sold the spa in 1923 to the Royal Nagysz√°ll√≥ Rt. The spa operated until 1944 but from that time it has been closed. The abandoned, obsolete spa was rediscovered in 1983 and, according to the original documents, there were plans to use the spa area for parking facilities. J√°nos Dian√≥czki, who was in charge of planning the multi-storey car park, turned down the proposal. The media and the public supported him and his decision made it possible for the current owners to restore the spa today.  Corinthia era  The Royal owes its revival to the Corinthia Group. The Maltese-based investment group operates four and five-star hotels in a number of countries, including Malta, The UK, Portugal, The Gambia, Tunisia, Turkey, the Czech Republic, Russia and Hungary. The Corinthia Grand Hotel Royal was restored as a result of a ‚Ç¨100 million investment, the largest scale hotel refurbishment project in Hungarian history.

This gene is a member of the Ras superfamily and is expressed in normal ovarian and breast epithelial cells but not in ovarian and breast cancers. It is a maternally imprinted gene, with monoallelic expression of the paternal allele, which is associated with growth suppression. Thus, this gene appears to be a putative tumor suppressor gene whose function is abrogated in ovarian and breast cancers. DIRAS3 is linked to breast cancer as well as ovarian cancer. The DIRAS3 gene includes one promoter, two exons and one intron with a 687 bp protein-coding region that encodes a 26-kDa protein. The DIRAS3 protein is a GTPase belonging to the Ras superfamily and shares 50‚Äì60% homology with Ras and Rap, two other small GTP binding proteins. Reduced expression of DIRAS3 has been reported in 70% of invasive breast cancers.  Structure and function  While ARHI is structurally similar to other GTPase proteins, its function is remarkably different from Ras. Ras is an oncogenic protein involved in cellular proliferation and signal transduction, and while the Ras superfamily generally consists of positive growth regulators, ARHI is a tumor-suppressor gene. In contrast to Ras, ARHI works as an inhibitor for cell growth, thus functioning as a negative growth regulator. ARHI has also been shown to have less GTPase activity than most Ras proteins even though the proteins share a very similar structure. The underlying cause for these dramatic differences in function is thought to be structural variations between ARHI and the Ras superfamily. The negative growth regulation exhibited by ARHI is most likely due to a unique 34-amino-acid N-terminus extension. This sequence is not generally found in the Ras superfamily, most of which show no inhibitory activity towards cell growth and even act as positive growth regulators. Deletion of this tail results in a significant drop in ARHI's ability to inhibit cell growth. This change in structure has no effect on protein expression levels or its GTP-binding ability, suggesting the extension's primary function is giving rise to this protein's negative growth regulation. The reduced GTPase activity observed in ARHI is thought to arise from critical differences in three specific amino acid residues in the effector domain. These residues are highly conserved in other Ras proteins, and are critical for the GTPase activity. In Ras, they are specifically G12, A59, and Q61. ARHI has three different amino acids in the effector domain: A46, K93, and G95. While ARHI still binds GTP with high affinity, its hydrolysis of GTP to GDP is relatively low because of these differences.  Role in cancer  While ARHI is constitutively expressed in normal ovarian and breast epithelial cells, it is absent in cancers found in these tissues where no expression of ARHI has been detected. In non-cancerous cells growth factor signals associate ARHI N- and C-terminally to the plasma membrane, where it can interact with C-RAF. This interaction inhibits the activation of MEK and ERK and even cell migration. In cancer tissues, where ARHI is not expressed, cells will thus migrate; this possibly is a cause for metastasis especially in breast cancer. ARHI influences also the cell cycle, specifically ARHI's strong inhibition of the cyclin D1 promoter. Cyclin D1 is an essential protein in the cell's progression from G1 to S phase, and its regulation by ARHI is critical in maintaining healthy cells. This is the mechanism by which ARHI inhibits cell growth and acts as a negative growth regulator. A loss of ARHI function could result in out-of-control cell growth and, in fact, cyclin D1 is often up- regulated in ovarian cancers and invasive breast carcinomas when ARHI is found to be down-regulated. When ARHI is introduced into cancer cells lacking this gene, many responses occur in addition to cyclin D1 down-regulation. These include induction of p21, activation of JNK, and reduced signaling through the Ras/MAP pathway. Thus, loss of any of these processes (arising from loss of ARHI) can lead to cancer. The \\"ARHI\\" gene is maternally imprinted (expressed monoallelically) and mapped specifically to 1p31, which is a common site for loss of heterozygosity (LOH). This locus on chromosome 1 is the most frequent deletion in breast and ovarian cancers. Because this gene is maternally imprinted, LOH of the nonimprinted allele (the paternal copy) confers a loss of ARHI expression. Although LOH has been reported in 40% of ovarian and breast cancers, another typical mechanism of gene silencing is through methylation. Since ARHI expression is decreased in 70% of invasive breast cancer, aberrant methylation is almost certainly the other common mechanism through which the gene is silenced. Found in \\"ARHI\\" are three CpG islands, which are common sites of epigenetic regulation, and hypermethylation of these regions in other tumor suppressor genes have been observed in various cancers. For example, decreased expression of BRCA1 in cancerous tissue has been linked with hypermethylation of the \\"BRCA1\\" promoter. Indeed, hypermethylation of certain CpG islands were associated with decreased expression of ARHI, and the protein showed a corresponding re-expression after demethylation of the regions. Because the gene is imprinted, the two-hit tumorigenesis model proposed by Knudson is reduced to a more susceptible situation. The nonexpression of the maternal allele leaves the gene only one ‚Äústrike‚Äù in terms of any number of mutational mechanisms, the two most common being LOH and hypermethylation of the gene promoter. In this way, the imprinted \\"ARHI\\" gene has a high risk of conferring cancers due to its susceptibility to mutations and epigenetic modifications.

In an interview, Hirsch claims that Grunkle Stan is loosely based on his grandfather, also named Stan. Stan is an older man, and the great-uncle (or \\"grunkle\\") of the show's main two protagonists, Dipper and Mabel; the show takes place as they stay at his house/tourist trap during the summertime. He is the owner of the Mystery Shack, a tourist trap presenting creatures and objects of supposedly supernatural origin. He often wears a black suit with a red fez, white shirt and red bolo tie, along with a cane topped by a billiard 8-ball, although at home he generally wears slippers, blue and green-striped boxer shorts, a white sleeveless shirt and a gold necklace. At the beginning of the show, Stan, known to all as Stanford Pines, is portrayed as a relatively simple character, whose shady past is mostly used as a joke regarding his many past crimes. However, as the series goes on, he is gradually revealed to hold deeper secrets; in \\"Not What He Seems\\", it is revealed that for the past thirty years, Stan had secretly been trying to bring his twin brother and the house's actual owner, the real Stanford Pines, into their world, and that he is in truth named Stanley. The character made an appearance in the 2018 graphic novel, Gravity Falls Lost Legends: 4 All-New Adventures. Fictional character biography = Early life = According to the Season 2 episode \\"A Tale of Two Stans\\", Stanley and his six-fingered twin brother Stanford were born in Glass Shard Beach, New Jersey to Filbrick Pines and his wife Caryn.https://partners.disney.com/shmeb- you-unlocked/book-8 The twins were raised Jewish but became atheists later in life, according to a secret web-page found in the aforementioned \\"Lost Legends\\" book.https://mobile.twitter.com/_alexhirsch/status/758547032554344448?lang=en Filbrick was a stern pawn shop owner, while Caryn, a pathological liar, worked as a phone psychic. The last name \\"Pines\\" was reportedly introduced in Ellis Island, but records of the family's original surname have been lost. In their earlier adolescent days, Stan and Ford often scoured the beach and go treasure hunting. One time, they claimed an abandoned ship for themselves, dubbing it the \\"Stan-O-War\\". The twins worked on repairing this boat over time, hoping to sail it around the world one day. As hinted in the Season 1 episode \\"Dreamscaperers\\", the boys were frequent targets of bullies, so Filbrick signed them up for boxing classes. Stan later used his boxing skills to save a woman named Carla McCorkle, nicknamed \\"Hotpants\\", from a robber. However, Carla eventually left him for a music-playing hippie. In school, Ford was a straight-A student and a favorite of his teachers, while Stan was a prank- loving slacker who often copied his brother's test answers. On one fateful night, Stan wandered into a science fair hall and accidentally broke his brother's prize-winning perpetual motion machine, ruining Ford's chances of being accepted into the prestigious university West Coast Tech and straining their relationship. Filbrick disowned Stan, refusing to allow him back home until he could make real money. Stan first took an interest in sales after seeing a billboard which glamorized the practice. Using various fake names over time, he started countless companies promoting \\"revolutionary\\" products that all turned out to be dysfunctional and poorly made. He was ultimately chased away by angry mobs each time the flaws in his products were discovered and banned in a majority of American states. He was also once arrested in Colombia and placed on the United States No Fly List, both for reasons unknown. = Arrival in Gravity Falls = Stan came to Gravity Falls upon receiving a postcard from Ford, now a Ph.D. graduate of the lackluster Backupsmore University, who used his research grants to build a house there and investigate the world's largest concentration of supernatural anomalies. In a dream, the demon Bill Cipher persuaded Ford into building an interdimensional portal with the aid of fellow Backupsmore alumnus Fiddleford McGucket (known in the present as local hillbilly \\"Old Man\\" McGucket) underneath Ford's house. In a test, Fiddleford survived an incident involving a gravity anomaly, leading him to quit the project, construct a ray gun to erase specified memories, and found the Society of the Blind Eye: an underground secret society dedicated the erasure of memories of townsfolk in Gravity Falls to keep the status quo. When Ford demanded answers, Bill revealed his true intentions, prompting Ford to contact Stan for help. After Stan arrived, he learned that Ford had hid two of his three journals documenting his supernatural findings and explaining how to operate the portal, entrusting the first to Stan in hopes he would agree to bury it \\"as far away as possible\\". Outraged that Ford did not call him to reconcile, Stan wanted to burn the journal. In a brawl, Stan threw Ford into the accidentally activated portal, which then ran out of fuel and deactivated. Stan learned to his dismay that he could not reactivate the portal without all three journals. With money running low, Stan went into town to buy some supplies to run away again, but locals mistook him for Ford and requested for a tour of the house, offering money. Stan agreed, adopting the name \\"Stanford\\" as his own. He tried to impress them with some of Ford's inventions but failed, then won over the tourists with his first fake attraction. Stan subsequently converted the house into a tourist trap of fake attractions, dubbing it initially \\"The Murder Hut\\", but later renaming it \\"The Mystery Shack\\". He even faked his death as Stanley in another state to avoid further pursuit from the police. For the last 30 years prior to the start of the series, Stan has continued to sneak into the lab at night to try reactivating the portal so he can rescue Ford. = Main Series = For most of Gravity Falls, Stan is shown to be a simple, miserly character who devises mischievous, comical plans to earn money from Mystery Shack tourism. Despite his greed, he is genuinely protective of his great-nephew Dipper and great-niece Mabel, whose parents have asked him to watch the twins for the summer. He also pretends to be unaware of Gravity Falls' supernatural oddities and engages in a bitter rivalry with Gideon Gleeful: the malevolent 10-year-old proprietor of another tourist trap dubbed the \\"Tent of Telepathy\\" who is bent on claiming the Mystery Shack for himself. Unbeknownst to Dipper and Mabel, Stan has the first of Ford's journals. By the end of the first season, following Gideon's arrest for causing mass destruction and fooling his tourists in the episode \\"Gideon Rises\\", Stan obtains all three journals and tries using them to reactivate the portal. He finally succeeds in reactivating the portal and bringing Ford back to his home dimension near the end of the second season episode \\"Not What He Seems\\". The brothers then tell their story to Dipper and Mabel and struggle to reconnect over subsequent episodes because of the different paths their lives have taken. In the last few episodes, the prophesied apocalypse dubbed \\"Weirdmageddon\\" begins, Bill Cipher captures Ford, and Stan takes refuge in the Shack, enchanted by Stanford's unicorn spell. McGucket finds him and invites into the Shack an army of the series' supporting characters. Stan is jealous of Dipper, Mabel, and his employees Soos and Wendy wanting to save him even though he feels responsible for the apocalypse. After a battle with Bill's demons using the \\"Shacktron\\", a fighting robot built from the Shack itself, the heroes unfreeze the rest of the townsfolk in Bill's fortress, the \\"Fearamid\\". To stop Bill, Ford draws on the floor a prophetic diagram bearing ten symbols around a wheel. Each symbol represents something related to one of the major characters of the series. Each individual stands on their symbol except Stan, who demands that Ford thank him. Ford gives him his request, but Ford corrects his grammar shortly after. The brothers fight until Bill finds them, captures the Pines family, and turns everyone else into tapestries. Dipper and Mabel distract Bill and escape their cell while Stan and Ford are locked in another cell, where they finally reconcile. Ford reveals that Bill needs a secret equation stored in his mind to spread the Weirdmageddon effect all over the world and that luring Bill into his mind, then erasing it with McGucket's memory gun, would erase the demon from existence. However, this is seemingly impossible, as Ford has a metal plate in his skull to stop Bill from accessing his thoughts. Stan volunteers to have his mind erased, and the brothers switch clothes. When Bill returns, the disguised Stan agrees to his plan, tricking Bill into entering the wrong mindscape. As Ford erases Stan's memory, Bill is punched into non-existence by Stan's mindscape self, who realizes that his purpose in life was to protect his family before he burns in silence. After Gravity Falls returns to normal, Stan awakens without any memories until his family and friends revive them. On the last day of the summer, Stan and Ford make plans to live out their dream of sailing around the world, this time to find more anomalies. Stan promotes an enthusiastic Soos to manager of the Shack and is last seen in a flash-forward at sea with Ford as they deal with an anomaly aboard a ship dubbed the \\"Stan-O-War II\\". Production =Character and concept= Stan is based on Alex Hirsch's own grandfather, also named Stan. Both share the characteristics of being big, barrel-chested guys whose clothes have popped-undone buttons; both also wear a gold chain and gold rings. Stan originally looked considerably different than he does in the show. In conceptual art, Stan was shorter, did not have his shoulder pads, and had a pointy pink nose instead of a big orange one. His face also more resembled a puppet than a grizzled old conman. This version of the character was seen in an unaired unofficial pilot of the show, which was low budget and a pre-production test version based around the aired pilot episode \\"Tourist Trapped.\\" Along with Dipper and Mabel, Stan has appeared in almost every episode of the series. He was featured in the Gravity Falls series of shorts entitled \\"Dipper's Guide to the Unexplained\\", as well as a short (\\"Stan's Tattoo\\") in which the twins investigate the mysterious tattoo on Stan's shoulder. In \\"A Tale of Two Stans\\", it's revealed that it was not a tattoo but a burn scar.

Olgiati is known for his work with Alfred Werner Maurer on the French Riviera, and has had some of his more notable work exhibited in the 1977 ETH Z√ºrich. Biography Olgiatis father was Oreste Olgiati; a lawyer and citizen of Poschiavo and Chur. In 1927, Olgiati graduated from the Grisons Canton School in Chur. He then studied at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, where he graduated in 1934, with Josef Zemp, in art history. Rudolf Olgiati worked as an architect, first in Z√ºrich and starting in 1944 in Flims, where he had purchased a house back in 1930 and then proceeded to renovate it making it the family home. Union List of Artist Names His son Valerio Olgiati is also active as an architect and lives in Flims in his father's house. Basic features of his work Rudolf Olgiati was a representative of the New Objectivity movement and one of the first architects in the mid-1950s to discover the importance and effectiveness of historical design principles for the architecture of modernity. Olgiati mainly built family houses in the mountainous region of Grisons, Switzerland, and restored old farmhouses and patrician houses, later also designed buildings in southern France and Germany together with Alfred Werner Maurer.Projekte bei www.detail.360.de vgl.Institut Architecture Nice vgl.Institut Architecture Nice Olgiati's cubical use of forms moved between the priorities of Grison's local architectural tradition, the ancient Greek style, and modernism mainly oriented on Le Corbusier. Thus, Olgiati was striving for a universal, timeless, and radically modern architecture, equally documenting the influence of international architecture as well as the indigenous Swiss architecture; thereby always remaining aware of its ideological and formal context. With Olgiati, who never considered the use of traditional elements as restorative, architecture is combined with local traditions and with the place as such, which he claimed to remodel by creating an intimate relationship between the architecture and the local residents. Olgiati's work has been exhibited in 1977 at ETH Z√ºrich, in 1986 at the Free Academy of the Arts in Hamburg, in 1986 at the Technical University of Berlin, and in 1988 at the Art University Linz, Austria.

The screenplay was written by Winston Graham based upon his eponymous 1950 novel. The film was directed by Anthony Pelissier and produced by Hugh Stewart. It was shot at Pinewood Studios with sets designed by the art director Alex Vetchinsky. Plot The film begins in the spring of 1947 on the south coast of France on the French Riviera. English lawyer Giles Gordon (David Farrar), has been partially blinded during service in World War II, and fears his eyesight is worsening. After stumbling in a shoe shop, the shop girl Alix Delaisse (Nadia Gray), recognises him later in the day and joins him at a cafe. She explains she is the widow of a French Resistance fighter hanged in Nice. Restaurateur Pierre Chava (G√©rard Landry) approaches Giles and warns him off with the claim that Alix is already promised to him. He tells Giles that Alix is involved with black marketers, blackmailers and murderers from the war years and demands that Giles forget her and return to England. Giles and Alix spend more and more time together. After a day of water sports in Monaco he stumbles into a room of Alix's black market contacts. She tells him to go home to England. Pierre also pressures him to leave. He goes to Pierre's flat and finds a dead body which, due to his poor eyesight he presumes to be Pierre, but he is persuaded by a marketeer that it was not Pierre. Giles goes back to England and goes to his doctor who says he can restore his sight. He has this operation and is shown a press cutting saying that Pierre has been killed in a car crash, but with his body unrecognisable. Giles returns to France and wears dark glasses to disguise his restored sight. He tracks down Alix and reveals that he can now see. Armand invites him to dinner with Alix and explains the whole situation: Pierre had betrayed the Resistance group to the Nazis, bringing the death of Alix's husband, and they had sought revenge. Malinay (Alix's brother) had killed Pierre in his flat. He later returned to collect the body and stage an alternate death. The marketeers decide Giles knows too much and try to stage another death: pushing him over a cliff in a car. However they fail to see him fall out and presume he is killed when the car explodes at the bottom. Giles struggles to ascend the steep cliff back to the road. He returns to confront Malinay and declare is ongoing love for Alix.

Electricity consumption in 2010 was 64.52 TWh, of which almost two-thirds came from fossil fuels, 21% from hydroelectric plants, and 13% from other renewable sources. The total generating capacity was 16.36 GW. The population of the Philippines is over 101 million people, and as a rapidly developing nation, has seen a rapid increase in GDP, averaging 6.1% from 2011 to 2015. Energy- intensive manufacturing and retail industries are the driving factors of the Philippines' economic growth. Given its large population and rapidly growing economy, the country's energy needs are significant and growing rapidly. According to the Philippines Department of Energy, the Philippines consumed 75,266 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity in 2013. Of this, 27.39% went to powering residential areas, 24.31% to commercial establishments and 27.46% to the industrial sector. With 72.84% of electrical energy being consumed by Luzon, 14.75% by Visayas, and 12.41% by Mindanao in 2013. Electricity The Philippines‚Äô demand for electrical energy in 2013 represents a 42.17% increase from 2012, when the demand for energy was at 52,941 GWh. It is expected that the country‚Äôs demand for power will increase as the Philippines‚Äô population and economy continue to grow. The Philippines‚Äô current energy mix highly favors fossil fuels, with coal, natural gas, and oil, accounting for 73.56% of the country's total electrical energy needs, primarily due to their low cost. The Philippines's most heavily used energy source is coal. Of the country‚Äôs 75,266 GWh electrical energy demand in 2013, 32,081 GWh or approximately 42.62% was sourced from coal. This heavy dependence on coal is further apparent by the high number of coal-fired power plants in the country. As of March 2016, there were 32 coal-fired power generation facilities connected to the energy grid. These facilities are spread throughout the country, although most of them are in Luzon and Visayas. The number of coal-fired power plants in the country is set to increase by 25 by the year 2030 to keep up with the Philippines‚Äô growing energy demands. Besides coal, the Philippines is also heavily dependent on natural gas. The Philippines produced 18,791 GWh of electricity from natural gas in 2013. This corresponded to 24.97% of the Philippines‚Äô electrical energy needs during this period. As of March 2016, there were a total of 13 natural gas generation facilities connected to the energy grid, 12 of which are in Luzon and one of which is in Cebu on Visayas. The Philippines also generates a significant amount of electrical energy from oil, albeit to a lesser degree than compared to coal and natural gas. In 2013, the Philippines sourced 5.97% of its energy from oil-based sources. As of March 2016, there were a total of 212 gas and diesel-powered facilities in the Philippines. The large number of oil-powered power plants is a result of a lower per plant output compared to coal and natural gas. Oil-powered power plants can be found dispersed across several provinces in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.  Renewable energy  Palinpinon Geothermal power plant in Negros Oriental The Government of the Philippines has introduced various policies to foster renewable energy. Some of the policies provide an income tax holiday up to seven years, duty-free import of equipment for renewable energy technologies, etc. In 2012, the government launched the new feed-in tariff (FIT).

The company was sold in 1992 to Thomas & Betts Corporation and its facilities were closed. History The company was formed in 1919 by Thomas R. Mullen, William H. Mohr and Les Kift during the height of Allentown's industrial era. Its facilities occupied 55 acres along the Lehigh River, consisting of heavy fabrication buildings, tower fabrication and tower galvanizing. Lehigh Steel was the only major steel manufacturer located in Allentown. Lehigh Steel received coal, iron ore and other requirements, and transported out its manufactured steel products via railroad links with the Lehigh Valley Railroad and the Central Railroad of New Jersey, both of which had spur lines that ran into the plant.Hellerich, Mahlon H, and Pennsylvania) Lehigh County Historical Society Allentown. Allentown, 1762-1987 : a 225-year history. Allentown, Pennsylvania: Lehigh County Historical Society, 1987 The company fabricated steel for everything from bridges and airplane hangars to high-rise office buildings. It fabricated large steel trusses and girders up to 150 feet long, weighing up to 75 tons. It also produced galvanized and chromium steel. It employed more than 500 workers in the 1960s and had annual sales of almost $90 million in the 1980s.End Of A Legend Lehigh Structural Steel Closes Chapter In Lehigh Valley, 1 November 1992 In 1967, the company expanded, purchasing Kaufman Fabricators of Texas and Wolko Engineering of Pottstown, Pennsylvania. It also constructed a second manufacturing plant, Lehigh-Lancaster Inc., in Lancaster, South Carolina. Lehigh Steel began to have labor problems in June 1973 when a wildcat strike over incentive pay for welders temporarily halted production. Additionally, the company had begun facing stiff competition from lower-priced imported steel. In early 1983, the Allentown plant closed and laid off 350 workers shortly after asking union workers to accept wage and benefits concessions. The union agreed to concessions several months later but the plant was closed for more than a year until it reopened in July 1984. Shortly afterwards, Lehigh Steel won a large contract to provide structural steel for two New York City office buildings that guaranteed work into February 1985. At that time, the company employed 260 people and had annual sales of almost $90 million. Its South Carolina plant won a contract to provide 1,100 tons of steel to Mack Truck, for the construction of its new plant in Winnsboro, South Carolina. However, pressure from foreign steel manufacturers led to a loss of orders during the mid-1980s. Canadian steel manufacturers, in particular, were cited for dumping more than 120,000 tons of steel a year to the United States during the late 1980s. While the Canadian market share amounted to about 5 percent at the time, a majority of the Canadian imports were being dumped in the Northeastern United States, which was Lehigh Structural Steel's prime market. In 1989, the company announced the decision to stop fabricating steel in Allentown, citing company losses of about $10 million in five years and the firm was no longer able to secure financing or bonding for future operations. The Lancaster plant, however, would remain open. The company sold its Allentown plant in June 1990 for $3 million to three local investors who renovated the property and begin to lease out space to area companies. The number of employees was reduced in Allentown to a small group of twelve executives. In June 1992, the Lancaster South Carolina plant was sold, and the last assets of Lehigh Steel were purchased by Thomas & Betts Corporation, an electrical equipment manufacturer based in Bridgewater, New Jersey on 25 August 1992. The Waterfront In 2012 The Waterfront Development Company announced plans to develop the 26-acre Lehigh Structural Steel site into a vibrant mixed-use development called ‚ÄúThe Waterfront.‚Äù Twelve Class A buildings will introduce more than 1,250,000 square feet of office, residential, retail and restaurant space along the western banks of the Lehigh River. The development will also include a signature garden-lined River Walk, two outdoor plazas, on-site docks for direct access to the Lehigh River, and a restaurant and retail promenade. The Waterfront is expected to introduce 2,800 new jobs, 750 new residents, and generate more than $4,200,000 annually in additional real estate taxes. The development is expected to take ten years for full build-out, with buildings opening as they are completed. The Waterfront is the first development The Waterfront Development Company is headed by Mark and Zachary Jaindl. The father-son team, founders of Jaindl Enterprises, focus on historical redevelopment and adaptive reuse projects to promote smart urban growth and the prevention of urban sprawl.

White Cap is also a franchisee of Sea Tow, the leading marine assistance services company. The National Park Service employs the firm to remove abandoned craft from the ecologically protected Gerritsen Creek, part of the Gateway National Recreation Area. In 2009 the New York Daily News reported on White Cap's assistance in the salvage of a large, historic brass bell. The 500 pound bell had once been at the top of a tower at Coney Island, and had been lost when the tower collapsed during a storm, 95 years earlier. The typical salvage fees for bringing smaller abandoned recreational craft to where they can be disposed of safely started at $1500. According to NBC News and the Brooklyn Daily, many boaters simply abandoned their recreational boats in 2008, without realizing they could still be identified as the boats' owners and could still be fined to pay for the boats disposal.

Amplang crackers are commonly made of ikan tenggiri (wahoo) or any type of Spanish mackerel, mixed with starch and other materials, and then fried. The shape and size of amplang might vary, from traditional elongated \\"tiger nails\\", to dice, to ping-pong balls. The colour may range from yellow to light brown. History Amplang on a plate In Indonesia, amplang is traditionally associated with Samarinda, the capital city of East Kalimantan, since the amplang cracker home industry has thrived in the city since the 1970s. Traditionally amplang was made from ikan pipih or ikan belida (Notopterus chitala), however since this freshwater fish has become scarce, amplang makers replaced them with ikan tenggiri (wahoo) or gabus (snakehead). From Samarinda, the popularity of this savoury fish cracker spread to other cities in the Borneo island, such as Balikpapan, Banjarmasin, Pontianak, and even to neighbouring Sabah in Malaysia. Amplang is often sought as oleh-oleh (foodstuff gift or souvenir) by those who visited East Kalimantan. Today, amplang made by home industries in Kalimantan has been widely distributed, available in marketplaces and supermarkets in Indonesian cities, such as Jakarta, Bandung, Surabaya, and Medan. Production centres Amplang is commonly produced by home industries in Samarinda, East Kalimantan in Indonesia. Other than Samarinda, amplang production centres also can be found in Balikpapan, Pontianak in West Kalimantan and Banjarmasin in South Kalimantan. In neighbouring Malaysia, amplang is mainly produced on the east coast of Sabah, particularly in the town of Tawau. Variants Today, the makers of amplang in East Kalimantan produce the snack not only with a fish flavor, but in a variety of flavors such as crab and seaweed. Nevertheless, the original amplang kuku macan remains the most popular.

It is located near the Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences. This Fort became the last brick fortification of Kaunas Fortress. The Seventh Fort is close to the central defenses and it is located in the rear of Kaunas Fortress. The first owner of fort was the 11th company of Kaunas Fortress Artillery (Imperial Russian Army). In 1915, German Army occupied the Fort without resistance. The Seventh Fort is one of the best surviving examples of a two-rampart fort, showing the typical design of a 19th-century Russian brick fort. Many authentic elements survive, such as iron window frames, ammunition warehouse gate fragments. During the Fort's restoration, a number of authentic interior details (interior decoration, paving, fittings of ammunition storage doors and gate) were found.  Layout  The fort project was prepared by Military Engineers Board of the Russian Empire in 1882, while modifying a typical design of two- rampart brick fort of 1879. The contract for the construction of the Seventh Fort was signed on 7 July 1883 between the contractor reserve lieutenant colonel Nikolay Shevtsov and Fortress Engineering Board. The Fort construction was completed around 1890. All buildings of the fort are typical fortification buildings of red brickwork with vaulted overlays, resistant to 8-inch projectile hits. The largest buildings are the barracks with the central postern. The Fort had two armories in faces, two armories in flanks and one central armory, four gun shelters, two riflemen galleries in the rear corners of the fort, and a defensive ditch. From all sides, except the rear, the fort was surrounded by a counterscarp wall and glacis behind it.  Artillery  The Seventh Fort was armed with eight 6-inch caliber 1877 model guns, twenty light (87 mm caliber) cannons, four copper 6-inch caliber mortars, and two Maxim machine guns. For the protection of the Fort's defensive ditch, nine lightweight 87 mm caliber cannons on Nasvetevich gun carriages and four 57 mm Nordenfeld cannon systems on the casemate gun carriages were installed on the fort's caponiers and semi-caponier. More than 15,000 different caliber shells and 300,000 rounds were stored in five ammunition warehouses. During World War I, 6-inch 45 caliber Canet gun was installed near the Fort, which successfully fired at the enemy's trenches in Germani≈°kiai village area.  Interwar period  A company of the Lithuanian Army was located in the fort since 1919. The goal of this temporary unit was adoption of military assets left by Germans for needs of the newly established Lithuanian Army. In 1924, newly created Lithuanian Central Archive and Military Archive moved to the fort. The military barracks were re-purposed for civilian archives by a Lithuanian interwar architect Vladimiras Dubeneckis. Interior partitions in the former fort kitchen on the right wing of the barracks were removed to create the office of archive's director. A cellar was excavated to house a boiler room of the central heating system underneath the casemate near central corridor of the barracks. Although the fort was adapted for civilian use, it still maintained a regime of a closed military object: to enter the fort territory one had to obtain authorization from the army.  World War II  The Seventh Fort was the first concentration camp in Nazi-occupied territories after the beginning of the war with the Soviet Union. German orders to concentrate the Jews of Lithuania into a separate camp were received on 29 June 1941. The next day, the decision had been made during the meeting of the Lithuanian Provisional Government to set up a Jewish concentration camp in the Seventh Fort . There had been appointed newly formed Tautinio Darbo Apsaugos Batalionas (known as TDA) for camp protection and murder of its prisoners. SS- Standartenf√ºhrer Karl J√§ger, commander of Einsatzkommando 3, was in charge of the prisoners and their executions. Up to 5,000 victims were killed in the fort's territory from 30 June 1941 until its closure on 10 August 1941. The remaining prisoners were transferred to Kaunas Ghetto. Most of them were Jewish residents of Kaunas. The largest number of victims were killed on 4 July (463 people) and 6 July (2514 people). Murdered bodies were thrown into the hole left from the half-caponier. Later other victims had been buried there too, near the fort wall. Main perpetrators of the bloody massacre were TDA battalion officers, together with their subordinates. The famous people among the victims were rabbi Elchonon Wasserman (1875‚Äì1941) and Lithuanian poet Vytautas Montvila (1902‚Äì1941). Starting September 1941, the Seventh Fort become a concentration camp for prisoners of war known as Stalag 336 or Stalag 336 F. Initially, the camp housed war prisoners of the Ukrainian nationality. There is evidence that about 1,500 Ukrainian prisoners died from the cold, diseases, and malnutrition in the winter of 1941 to 1942. The exact number of war prisoners dead and buried at the Seventh Fort is unknown. The fort was also used to train German auxiliary personnel (Hilfswilliger).  Soviet period  Former barracks, headquarters and warehouses of the fortress were used by Soviet Army regiments. Forts had been turned into storage of the war reserve and soldier deployment places. Pioneer unit engaged in restoration of bridges blown during World War II was based in the Seventh Fort. Later, the fort were transferred to the 29th Voentorg (military supply) of the Baltic Military District. Warehouses and Voentorg administration were located in the fort barracks and powder cellars. During this period, the historic fort suffered much damage: the defensive ditch was filed with trash and dirt, building facades were damaged, drainage system was destroyed, left artillery yard was paved with asphalt, garages for auto vehicles storage were built.  Independent Lithuania After the Russian Army left Lithuania in 1993, the Seventh Fort was transferred to the Lithuanian National Defence Volunteer Forces (KASP). There, three companies of the 22nd KASP Battalion were deployed from 1993 to 2007. The Lithuanian government decided to sell the fort as did not find the use to it after discontinue of this battalion. Fort's reconstruction was started in spring 2009 when Lithuanian non-profit organization Military Heritage Centre became the owner of the Seventh Fort. One of the first projects carried out in the fort was scientific and field research, restoration of casemates, and removal of asphalt paving. Additionally, low-value garages were demolished, drainage system was restored which allowed the rear caponier to become accessible once again. The Seventh Fort opened its gates to the visitors in spring 2011 for the first time in its history. The same year, graves of the genocide victims were found in the right wing of the fort. The site was cleaned of plants and trash and a memorial route was created. Since 2012, the Seventh Fort is a member of the Lithuanian Museum Association. There are created expositions of Kaunas Fortress history and artillery evolution in the barrack casemates. There are organized tours, school educational programs and various topics events intended to remember important events of Lithuanian history in the fort.

Although Islam is the predominant faith in Azerbaijan, religious affiliation is nominal in Azerbaijan and percentages for actual practicing adherents are much lower. It is difficult to quantify the number of atheists or agnostics in Azerbaijan as they are not officially counted in the census of the country. Azerbaijan is the most secular state in the Muslim world.  Research and statistics  According to a study conducted by the Caucasus Research Resource Centers, in 2010, approximately 2,000 people were interviewed, of which 28% answered that religion is \\"an extremely important\\" part of their life. Two years later, the survey was conducted again, but only about 1800 people were interviewed, of which 33% reported that religion is an extremely important part of their life. In addition, another 44% claimed that religion is a \\"fairly important\\" part of their daily lives. The remaining 23% claimed that religion is a relatively important or completely insignificant part of their daily lives. Despite the fact that 77% of respondents noted that religion is an extremely important or rather important part of their life, only 2% of them attend religious services every day, 3% from once a week and more, twenty percent occasionally fast, and about half never follows it. Mirza Fatali Akhundov, 19th century Azeri modernist and father of the atheist movement in Azerbaijan.M. Iovchuk (ed.) et el. [The Philosophical and Sociological Thought of the Peoples of the USSR in the 19th Century http://www.biografia.ru/about/filosofia46.html]. Moscow: Mysl, 1971. According to a recent Gallup Poll, Azerbaijan is one of the most irreligious countries in the Muslim world, with about 53% of respondents indicating the importance of religion in their life as little or none.GALLUP WorldView - data accessed on 16 August 2013 The same poll indicates that only 20% of the respondents has attended on religious services. Gallup International indicated that only 34% of Azerbaijanis adhere to religious practices, and ranked Azerbaijan the 13th least religious country from data compiled in 2005, 2008 and 2015.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/most-religious- countries-in-the-world/ In 2012, as part of the World Value Survey, there was conducted a comparative analysis of countries on the importance of religion in people's lives. The poll was conducted on a scale from zero to one, where the zero mark meant that religion is \\"not at all important\\", and the one mark was \\"extremely important\\". According to the results of this survey, the index of Azerbaijan was 0.52 and took 33rd place out of 80 participating countries. According to the journal named \\"Caucasus & Globalization\\", the number of religious people participating in the survey was 62.7%, and very religious - 6.4%. 10.6% of the respondents found it difficult to answer. The poll also asked about the importance of religion in everyday life, which was answered by the respondents as follows: for 11% it plays a very important role, for 25.7% - an important role, for 41% - moderate, for others it either plays an insignificant role, or does not play any role at all. In 2005 another poll was conducted, which revealed that 87% of the population of 12 regions of Azerbaijan consider themselves religious, while about 10% believe that they are religious rather than atheists, and only 1% say that they are atheists. According to the Pew Research Center, according to the results of the study, 99.4% of the population are Muslims. The same research center reported in 2010 that 96.9% of the population is Muslim, and less than 1% of people do not consider themselves as affiliated to any of the religions. According to Crabtree, Pelham (2009), Azerbaijan is in the list of 11 least religious countries in the world with only 21% people saying that religion is an important part of their life.  20th century  In 1920 the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic disintegrated and in 1922 became part of the USSR. Since in the USSR atheism was an important part of the state ideology, Azerbaijan was also subjected to the influence of the authorities in relation to religion. At that time mosques were being destroyed - thus, by 1933 only 33 mosques were functioning. In 1967 the Museum of the History of Atheism was created, which after the collapse of the USSR was renamed the State Museum of the History of Religion. The population of Azerbaijan due to persecution and the threat of life had to hide its religious views. This \\"prudent concealment of faith\\" is permitted in the Qur'an and is only a temporary and formal denial of faith. However, the period of temporary rejection of faith lasted from 1922 until 1991, when Azerbaijan regained its independence. 70 years of forced abandonment of faith played a role in the further perception of religiosity on the part of the population.

History In the closing stage of the war, nine of the Grossfuss Sturmgewehr prototypes were captured by the advancing Red Army; five of these were found at the Kummersdorf testing site. These guns were given the name \\"Avtomat Horn\\" (Horn assault rifle) in the Soviet documents analyzing them. The Soviets also captured schematics for the gun and the designer himself. (Horn spent most of his time in the USSR at factory Number 74, later known as Izmash, where other famous German weapons designers were held, including Hugo Schmeisser, etc.–ò. –®–∞–π–¥—É—Ä–æ–≤, \\"–•—É–≥–æ –®–º–∞–π—Å—Å–µ—Ä –≤ –ò–∂–µ–≤—Å–∫–µ (–ß–∞—Å—Ç—å 1)\\", –ú–ê–°–¢–ï–†–†–£–ñ–¨–Å, November 2009) Although the total number of Grossfuss Sturmgewehrs manufactured is not known, the numerous differences (noted by the Soviets) in part dimensions between the blueprints and the captured exemplars pointed to the experimental nature of the guns, suggesting that design adjustments were still being made.–Æ—Ä–∏–π –ü–æ–Ω–æ–º–∞—Ä—ë–≤ \\"–ê–≤—Ç–æ–º–∞—Ç –•–æ—Ä–Ω–∞\\", –ö–ê–õ–ê–®–ù–ò–ö–û–í. –û–†–£–ñ–ò–ï, –ë–û–ï–ü–†–ò–ü–ê–°–´, –°–ù–ê–†–Ø–ñ–ï–ù–ò–ï 2006/9, pp. 20‚Äì26 According to the personal notes of Horn, the Heereswaffenamt requirements for this gun were as follows: it had to use the blowback principle of operation, use the ammunition and magazines of the MKb 42(H), have a cyclic rate of fire of 500 rounds per minute, a mass of 4 kg, and have the same barrel and overall length as the MKb 42(H). The requirement to use blowback as principle of operation was interpreted as asking for a gun that was cheap to build, because it translated in a simple design with few parts. The 7.92√ó33mm Kurz cartridge was however considerably more powerful than the pistol rounds used in submachine guns, so it would have normally required a bolt weighing about 1.5 kg, which was difficult to reconcile with the target weight for the gun. Kurt Horn found an innovative solution to this problem, the gas delayed blowback (German: Gasdruckverschluss). The idea was relatively simple: part of the gasses escaping from the chamber were redirected in the direction opposite to the rearward movement of the bolt; their pressure pushed against a piston connected to the bolt itself, thus decelerating the rearward movement of the latter. This method of operation allowed Horn to reduce the weight of the bolt to about 0.8‚Äì0.9 kg. More or less the same idea was employed by Karl Barnitzke in the design of the better known Gustloff VG 1-5 (MP 507). However Barnitzke's design was far less efficient. Whereas Horn's design captured gas escaping from the breech, in Barnitzke's the gas was collected through four small holes near the muzzle, far too late to have much impact on the initial rearward acceleration of the bolt, which in the VG 1-5 weighted 1.4 kg. In Horn's gun, one end of the piston is connected to the bolt by a joint and the other end is connected to the receiver by a small spring. The piston also exhibits an interesting sideways motion. As the bolt moves further backward, the piston moved slightly sideways as well, allowing most of the gas to escape without exercising further pressure. The role of the small spring was to ensure the return of the piston's head into position on the counter-recoil. The gun's sights are fixed to 300 meters. It has a three-way selector between single, automatic fire, and safe position. The bolt has two handles, one on each side and these resemble horns. They were found rather unergonomical by the Soviet testers because they could hit the hand on automatic fire. The length of the draw for the bolt in order to cock the gun was also found to be unpleasantly long, especially from the prone position. The weapon would have been cheap to manufacture en masse. The only milled parts were the barrel and the bolt head. One of captured Grossfuss Sturmgewehrs was tested by the GAU. It fired about 1,900 rounds without stoppages. Its accuracy was basically on par with the MP 43, even though the length of its sighting line was considerably shorter (266 vs. 418 mm). Although the existence of the Grossfuss Sturmgewehr and its basic principle of operation became known in the West in the decade following the end of the war, hardly anything else transpired from behind the Iron Curtain. According to a 1958 book of the US Army Ordnance Corps: > The firm of Grossfuss in Dobelin produced a unique retarded blowback gas- > actuated system, no specimens of which has ever been seen.

He was involved in the design of early railway locomotives, and invented innovative steam-powered \\"grapple boats\\" driven by traction wheels running along the bed of the river or canal. Early years Verpilleux coal mine #1 at Saint- √âtienne, later named after the engineer Claude Verpilleux was born at Rive de Gier in 1798, son of a canal worker. His father died when he was ten. His limited education allowed him to read, calculate, and to write with some difficulty. On 15 August 1810 he began work at a daily salary of one franc at the Montjoint mines in Rive de Gier. One of the mine concessionaires, Fleurdelix, was struck by Verpilleux's activity and intelligence, and had him help install a British steam engine, which was not working satisfactorily. Verpilleux immediately understood how the machine worked, and in 1814 at the age of 16 was placed in charge of it. He examined it carefully and improved it, then built a model of his own which proved satisfactory. When he was aged twenty-two his employer lent him the money to open a workshop for repairing and improving the English machines that were being used in the mines of the district. He opened his workshop in 1820. From 1825 to 1832 he also worked as an expert mechanic for the Terrenoire company in their workshops in the foundry at La Voulte-sur-Rh√¥ne, helping repair or improve their steam engines, while continuing to run his own workshop. From 1832 he devoted all his time to his workshop. He was able to employ his brother and the son of his wife, Fran√ßois Baldeyrou. A Verpilleux locomotive with steam-powered tender The railway line running west from the coalfield at Saint-√âtienne to Andr√©zieux on the Loire was opened in 1827, the first railway in France. From Andr√©zieux the coal was shipped north on flat-bottomed barges. In 1832 Verpilleux helped make a second line between Saint-Etienne and Lyon, to the east, on the Rhone. At this time the railway could not carry a locomotive weighing more than 10 tons, and the slope was too steep for any locomotives of the day. Verpilleux built a locomotive with a tender where steam power was applied to the wheels of both locomotive and tender. It could pull a train of up to 40 empty wagons back up the railway. The S√©guin company realized substantial savings, and entrusted Verpilleux with the wagons between Rive-de-Gier and Saint-Etienne for the next ten years. Inventions Grappin Verpilleux, showing the drive chains and grapple wheel On 23 August 1839 Verpilleux Fr√®res (Verpilleux brothers), mechanical engineers at Rive de Gier, filed a patent application, which was approved a week later. It was for a new system of steam boats specially used for the ascent of travelers and merchandise in rivers and canals. A \\"grapple wheel\\" in diameter rolled along the bottom of the canal or river ahead of the boat. It gained traction from teeth set round its circumference. It was attached to the boat by two loops of chain, one on each side, that transmitted power from the boat's steam engine and pulled the boat forward. The boats could travel against a current with much less energy than conventional paddle wheel designs, and could travel through canals that had been invaded by water weeds. In September 1842 the Verpilleux brothers patented a tender locomotive equipped with two cylinders. Seven of these were in service by 1844. In 1844 the last section of the line from Rive-de-Gier to Saint Etienne was opened using Verpilleux's locomotive tenders, which were more powerful than those of Marc Seguin, totally eliminating horse-drawn railway wagons. Verpilleux began a fertile collaboration with his contemporary, the engineer Fran√ßois Bourdon (1797-1865). By 1848 Verpilleux and Bourdon had put six grappins into service on the Sa√¥ne. On 16 February 1851 Verpilleux demonstrated a three-wheeled steam-driven car, which traveled by road between Rive-de-Gier and Saint- Etienne at a speed of up to . However, the car frightened the horses and was not a commercial success. Other activities During the French Revolution of 1848 both Verpilleux and Bourdon were elected to the constitutional assembly. On the Republican party's list Verpilleux was described as \\"a man who, from a simple workman, has by his work and his genius raised himself to the rank of the most skilled engineers in the country. It is he who supplied the powerful machines for the railway lines of the Loire and the Rhone.\\" Verpilleux was a member of the Saint-Etienne chamber of commerce from 1853 to 1866. On 10 November 1858 his daughter Elizabeth married Pierre de Montgolfier at Rive-de- Gier. Montgolfier was later to become a Senator. Jean-Claude Verpilleux was mayor of Rive-de-Gier in 1869 and 1874. He was made a Knight of the Legion of Honor in 1841, and an Officer of the Legion of Honor in 1874. He died on 13 October 1875. The rue Jean-Claude Verpilleux in Saint-Etienne is named after him.

After working as a tour escort to \\"grow up\\" and save money, Tanonaka graduated from Mesa College (now Colorado Mesa University) in Grand Junction, Colorado, in 1976 with an Associate in Arts degree, and Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Illinois, in 1977 with a Bachelor of Science degree in journalism. Career After TV and newspaper jobs at the ABC and NBC affiliates in Honolulu and the Honolulu Advertiser, Tanonaka was recruited by Japan's public broadcaster NHK in 1990. He helped launch and was the anchor of \\"Japan Business Today\\", an internationally distributed daily program from Tokyo. After the NHK project ended in 1994, Tanonaka joined the launch team of the U.S. business channel CNBC in Asia. From regional headquarters in Chai Wan, Hong Kong, Tanonaka anchored daily news and feature programs including \\"The NBC Asia Evening News\\" and \\"Money, Money, Money\\".

The firm opened its London gallery in 1860, where it soon established itself as one of Mayfair's leading dealerships. Since then Agnew's has held a pre- eminent position in the world of Old Master paintings. It also had a major role in the massive growth of a market for contemporary British art in the late 19th century. In 2013, after nearly two centuries of family ownership, Agnew's was purchased privately and is now run by Lord Anthony Crichton- Stuart, a former head of Christie's Old Master paintings department, New York. Royal Academy of Arts Collections: Persons (Accessed August 2013) Chun, Dongho (2011) \\"Art Dealing in Nineteenth-Century England: The Case of Thomas Agnew\\", Horizons: The Seoul Journal of the Humanities, Vol. 2, No. 2 pp. 255-277 Antiques Trade Gazette, 10 March 2014, New owners for Agnew‚Äôs as National Gallery buy archive (Accessed October 2018) History Agnew's, as it is commonly called, has long held a prominent position in the Bond Street trade in Old Master pictures. The founder's sons, Sir William Agnew, 1st Baronet (1825-1910) and Thomas Agnew (1827-1883), were pivotal in the firm's rise in London, where Agnew's first established itself in 1860. Broadly speaking, Sir William's line produced the in-house connoisseurs (most notably C. Morland Agnew [1855-1931]), while Thomas's son, W. Lockett Agnew (1858-1918), inherited his father's commercial flair. It was William Agnew who shifted the gallery trade to Old Masters. As The Times noted in Sir William's obituary, \\"in 1877 the firm had built rooms in 39 Old Bond Street (later called 43 Old Bond Street), and when the succession of Old Master exhibitions, the example of Sir Richard Wallace and the Rothschilds, and the revived passion for eighteenth-century architecture and furniture had turned the taste of the new rich men back to the older art, William Agnew was ready to find the pictures.\\" Their Majesties King George V and Queen Mary leaving Agnew's after a private view in 1935. Agnew's acted as principal agent and advisor to Edward Cecil Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh (1847-1927). The firm also held a significant part in the collecting activities of Alfred Beit (1853-1906), John G. Johnson (1841-1917), Alfred de Rothschild (1842-1918), Ferdinand de Rothschild (1839-1898), Henry Clay Frick, and George Salting (1835-1909). King George V (1865-1936) visited Agnew's Bond Street galleries on numerous occasions. Additionally, Agnew's often served as agent for the National Gallery in the salerooms. More recently, important clients include Paul Mellon (1907-1999), Norton Simon (1907-1993), and the Samuel Henry Kress Foundation. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the firm was well regarded not only by the era's leading collectors, but also by fellow dealers. Consequently, in Bond Street, Agnew's enjoyed friendly relations with Knoedler, Arthur Joseph Sulley (1853-1930), the Wertheimer brothers, and in Paris, Charles Sedelmeyer (1837-1925). alt= During the remainder of the 20th century and up to today, Agnew's has placed many masterpieces in major museums in Europe, America, and in emerging global markets. The contributions to the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, and the National Gallery, London, are noteworthy. The firm has handled major pictures by, amongst others, Caravaggio, John Constable, Van Dyck, El Greco, Guercino, Frans Hals, Poussin, Rembrandt, Rubens, Vermeer, Titian, Pontormo, J.M.W. Turner, Joseph Wright of Derby, and Vel√°zquez, including the latter's Rokeby Venus in the National Gallery, London. Agnew's also exhibited and sold works of Impressionist and Modern artists such as Paul C√©zanne, Camille Pissarro, Paul Gauguin, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas, and Pablo Picasso. In recent years, the gallery has increasingly promoted the establishment of lesser-known artists of the early twentieth century, namely the German-Swedish painter and portraitist Lotte Laserstein. In 2008, the purpose-built gallery in Old Bond Street (1877), designed by Salomons & Wornum, was sold by Agnew's to Etro, the Italian fashion house. In 2013, after nearly two centuries of family ownership, Agnew's was purchased privately and has relocated its gallery premises to 6 St James's Place, London, under the directorship of art historian Lord Anthony Crichton-Stuart.

Early life Rick McFarland was born in the city of Whittier, 12 miles southeast of Los Angeles. He spent his early years in Southern California and moved to Utah at the age of 10. While still in high school, he obtained his commercial pilot's license. McFarland graduated from Brigham Young University in 1996 with a BA in music. Film career McFarland worked his way through college as a freelance producer, sound designer, and editor, participating on such documentaries as Out of the Ashes, Immortal Fortress: A Look Inside Chechnya's Warrior Culture, and Roots & Wings. During his freelance years he developed a specialty in language replacement pieces for various companies and produced, and also scored Truth and Conviction, a PBS documentary film about a young boy who defied the Nazis during World War II. As a part of that experience, McFarland was able to interview Nobel Prize winner G√ºnter Grass about his thoughts on Helmut Huebner. Truth and Conviction has now inspired additional research, books, and even a feature-length screenplay on his life. In 2003 he came to Cosmic Pictures in Salt Lake City where he produced hundreds of broadcast and noncommercial pieces and Stalking Santa, a feature-length film narrated by William Shatner. He also wrote a number of commercial scripts and feature screenplays. He founded his own company, Fiftyfilms, in 2006 where he has continued his prodigious commercial work with clients such as Intel, Verizon, BAE Systems, Purina, Sabick, and Microsoft. McFarland produced and edited My Girlfriend's Boyfriend starring Alyssa Milano, Christopher Gorham, and Michael Landes in 2009. Because of his love of flying, McFarland has developed a particular expertise in aerial photography. He has also enjoyed traveling everywhere from Germany to Australia and Costa Rica to Guam. For his latest screenplay, McFarland took a research trip to Kathmandu in 2011. He found a country which was both absolutely foreign and strangely similar to his home state of Utah. Once the script was finished, casting and filming began in 2012. Highway to Dhampus was the first independent feature film shot entirely in Nepal by a foreign director and crew. It is also a deeply personal film for McFarland, drawing much from his own experiences and transposing them into a Nepali setting.

The golf course was built in 1968 by golf course architect Bob Simmons. Simmons designed and built golf courses for 30 years before his death in 1986. Dothan National Golf Club was originally named Olympia Spa and under that moniker played host to the 1974 SEC Collegiate Golf Championship. In the 1980s the name of the club changed to Dothan National Golf Club. In 2000, the club hosted the Nike Tour. The golf course has also hosted multiple Emerald Coast Golf Tour events. In 2004, the Emerald Coast Golf Tour Fall Classic Golf Tournament was won by Bubba Watson who eventually went on to the PGA Tour and won a Masters green jacket in 2011. The golf course is 7,425 yards long from the back tees and plays to both par 72 and a par 73 due to the 18th hole which is listed on the card as par four or a par five depending on the tee location. The property was originally developed by the Flower's family which also developed nearby Flower's Hospital. The Flowers were originally drilling for oil on the property and instead of hitting oil, they tapped into a hot mineral water spring. Doctor Flowers sent patients from his hospital to the Olympia Spa for rehabilitation. The golf course and hotel were built around the site of the hot mineral spring. The Flowers family sold the golf club and hotel in 1988. The golf course and hotel went bankrupt and closed its doors in the fall of 2012. New owners reopened the facility in January 2013.

It is used in Software performance testing. It allows evaluation of design options and system sizing based on actual or anticipated business usage. It is therefore much faster and cheaper than performance testing, though it requires thorough understanding of the hardware platforms. The Model The model is fed with measurements of transaction resource demands (CPU, disk I/O, LAN, WAN), weighted by the transaction-mix (business transactions per unit of time). The weighted transaction resource demands are added-up to obtain the resource demands and divided by the resource capacity to obtain the resource loads. Changes in response time can also be predicted by the model. For example, in a simple case with a single resource, the response time formula: R=S/(1-U) where R=response_time, S=service_time, U=utilization, will calculate the response time as the utilization of that resource varies between 0=0% busy to 1=100% busy. This formula is a good approximation of the more complex math of queueing theory and requires adjustment when dealing with multiple resources.

As a result, Speaker of the House Valentine Rausch moved Nelson's seat in the legislature, and the incident was cited as one of the reasons Nelson was removed from the Republican Caucus for a period of time. In removing Nelson from the caucus, House Majority Leader David Lust stated \\"I am not going to condone the conduct he engaged in toward another member of the Legislature very publicly. It's just not acceptable.\\" = Robocall controversy = In 2013 Stace Nelson was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a case where the State of South Dakota prosecuted Dan Willard for political robodialed phone calls that were made without a disclaimer.

He was born to a Tlaxcalteca indigenous father of modest means, but his parents had interest in the arts, history and literature. Meza showed interest in art and music in his youth, studying painting with Santos Balmori. Later, he approached Diego Rivera to look for an apprenticeship, but instead, the painter recommended him to the prestigious Galer√≠a de Arte Mexicana, which helped him develop as an artist as well as promoted his work for twenty years. Meza won various awards for his work during his career and was also granted membership in the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana. Life Meza was the son of Milit√≥n Meza Garc√≠a, a Tlaxcalteca indigenous person and Soledad Alvarez Molina. growing up in the Colonia Peralvillo neighborhood of Mexico City. His father was a tailor and despite their modest means, both he and his wife were interested in culture, buying books and magazines on topics such as painting, music, history and literature. Meza showed interest in drawing and music from an early age, starting with drawing when he was eight. From age twelve to nineteen he studied music on several instruments at the Escuela Popular de M√∫sica Jos√© Austri. His formal schooling went only through the ninth grade because of family finances, then working with his father. However, he also did some work illustrating magazines and in his free time, copied classical figures such as Venus de Milo and Nike of Samothrace, which helped him master depicting the human body and the emotions it can express. In 1933, he entered the Escuela Noctora de Arte para Trabajadores Num 1, studying engraving with Francisco D√≠az de Le√≥n and drawing with Santos Balmori. Balmori invited Meza to work as an assistant on murals he was commissioned to paint in Morelia, Michoac√°n. With the money he earned, Meza attended the Escuela Espa√±a-M√©xico, a school established to house and education 500 Spanish children who had fled the Spanish Civil War . There he met Josefa S√°ndez, better known as Pepita and the couple married in 1947, producing four children Carolina, Federico, Magdalena and Alejandro. Pepita died in 1968 at the couple's home in the Contreras neighborhood of Mexico City, causing Meza to stop painting completely for a time. Meza died at the age of 80 from internal bleeding and heart failure, complications of diabetes. The body was buried at the Pante√≥n Jardin in Mexico City. Career When Meza returned from Morelia to Mexico City he was in financial straits, forcing him to work jobs such as tailor, mechanic and photographic retoucher to get by. Then he went to see Diego Rivera to ask for a kind of apprenticeship. Instead, Rivera asked to see Meza's work, even going to the youth's house to see the entire collection. Impressed, Rivera told him he did not need an apprenticeship and instead wrote a letter of recommendation to In√©s Amor, owner of the prestigious Galer√≠a de Arte Mexicano. From the 1940s to the 1960s, this gallery handled sales of his work and promoted it in various exhibitions both in Mexico and abroad. Amor also recognized Meza's talent and gave the young artist special attention. Upon taking him on as a client, she refused to take her customary thirty percent commission on his sales until Meza was economically stable. She also hired Meza's wife as a secretary. The gallery also helped Meza develop professionally, allowing him to see the works of Rufino Tamayo, and meet people such as Igor Stravinsky, Le√≥n Felipe, Carlos Ch√°vez, Silvestre Revueltas, Xavier Villaurrutia, Jos√© Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Salvador Dal√≠, Max Ernst, Andr√© Breton and Henry Moore among many other notable people. Meza's individual exhibitions during his career included those of the Galer√≠a as well as various museums, including the Museo de Arte Moderno. Collective exhibitions included participation in the Arte Mexicano show in New York in 1940, the same year he presented El cargador at the International Exposition of Surrealism. His works can be found in collections mostly in Mexico and the United States. These include the collections of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes, the Banco Nacional de M√©xico, the Club de Industriales, the Exc√©lsior offices, the Museo de Monterrey, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Art Museum of the University of Michigan, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Art Gallery of the Stanford University, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Thomas Gilcrease Foundation of Oklahoma and of the Ponce Museum of Art at the University of Puerto Rico. While best known for his canvas work, he also did other projects as well. In 1951 he did five mural panels for the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social in 1951 and in 1958, he painted an acrylic mural on wood called Los cuatro elementos for the Club de Industriales. He also did work on the sets and costumes for various theatrical performances and cinema, starting with the play The Adding Machine by Elmer Rice and the Academia Mexicana de Danza in 1947 and the theatre group La Linterna M√°gica directed by Ignacio Retes in 1948. This was followed by more work with the dance academy as well as the 1971 film Mictl√°n by Ra√∫l Kamffer and the 1972 performances of the K.P.H. Ballet of Rossana Filomarino in Mexico and Italy. In 1977, he also did this work for the Ballet Tr√≠o of Alejandro Meza and the Royal Ballet Dens Norske Opera from Oslo. Meza's first recognition for his work was the Shering-Kahlbaum House Award in Berlin for the plot and drawings he created for a film in 1940. In 1949, he won second place at a competition sponsored by the Exc√©lsior newspaper called la ciudad de M√©xico interpretada por sus pintores. In 1953 and 1954 he won first place at ‚Äúwinter salon‚Äù competitions with the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana, which granted him membership. In 1961 he received an honorable mention at the Tokyo Biennial. Artistry Meza began with drawing, exploring that medium completely, before painting in gouache. He did not completely dedicate himself to oils until 1939. Although it has been claimed that Meza was self-taught, it is known that he studied for a significant period under Santos Balmori. During his lifetime, his aesthetic interests varied from expressionism, Dadaism and post-Dadaism and then surrealism . His early works were in an expressionist style, with symbolism of rupture and denouncement against society. He then experimented with Dadaism techniques which gave way to a kind of anarchism searching for ‚Äúpure liberty.‚Äù However, these gave way to surrealism as a less extreme expression as he became an admirer of Andr√© Breton as well as Sigmund Freud, calling himself a ‚Äúapolitical surrealist‚Äù with elements of realism emerging making his work neither literal or oppressively symbolic. The themes of his work focused on fantasy, religion and myth, especially indigenous Mexican thought in his later work. The backgrounds are almost pure fantasy, as in alien worlds, with figures that are generally more meditative than rational. His human figures often have deformation or changes in their extremities, such as extending into foliage or tongues of fire and sometimes in enigmatic concavities that provoke horror. This has led his images to be compared to those of the poetry of William Blake and the paintings of Francisco Goita. However, his work never reached the extremes of deformation like that of Salvador Dal√≠. His fantasy was inclined towards denouncing the evils of society, with reflective topics which could be wounding and painful. His later work is marked by influence from Mexico's indigenous tradition, especially that of his Tlaxcalteca father, leading to a kind of surrealism based on indigenous magic and cosmic vision rather than that of Europe. This shift came not only from his heritage (both his parents were ‚Äúcuranderos‚Äù or shamanistic healers) but also from an identification with the struggles of Mexico's marginalized indigenous.

Life and career Strand was born on February 12, 1894, in Victoria, Texas,Strand, p. 13. to August M. and Christina (Dohl) Strand. His father was born in Sweden about 1855, and his mother in Sweden about 1861. They emigrated to the United States, first taking up residence in Missouri, where their first three children were born: Rose L. in 1885, Ettie C. in 1888, and May F. in 1887. The family moved to Victoria, Texas, where August was born in 1894. His brother Victor D. was born there in 1896. The Strands then moved to Helena, Montana, in 1901\\"Dr. A.L.

Strand graduated from Helena High School in 1913. Strand enrolled at what was the known as Montana State College (now Montana State University) and earned a bachelor of science degree in entomology in 1917.\\"A.L. Strand Will Be Honored at MSC Graduation.\\" Helena Independent Record. May 18, 1957. From 1917 to 1919, he served in the United States Navy as an aviator with the rank of ensign. From 1919 to 1923, he served as Assistant State Entomologist for the state of Montana. He left in 1924 to become Assistant Extension Entomologist at Pennsylvania State College (now Pennsylvania State University) in State College, Pennsylvania. (The Cooperative Extension System is a program of the U.S. federal government administered by land-grant universities and colleges to educate farmers and ranchers about modern agricultural practices.) He enrolled in the doctoral program at the University of Minnesota in 1924, receiving his master of science in entomology in 1925 and his Ph.D. in entomology (with a concentration in agricultural biochemistry) in June 1928. Strand served as a teaching assistant at the University of Minnesota from 1924 to 1928. He was appointed an assistant professor in 1928, and served until 1931. =Montana State College= Strand received an appointment as assistant professor of entomology at Montana State College in 1931. He was later promoted to professor and head of the Department of Entomology. President Alfred Atkinson resigned in 1937 to become president of the University of Arizona. Strand, who had discovered ways of controlling the devastating locust invasions in Montana, was named the new president. He was the first graduate of the college to become its president. On July 6, 1937, Strand was elected President of Montana State College (MSC) by the school's board of regents. Dr. Atkinson called him one of the nation's top three entomologists at the time of his election. An upsurge in campus drinking occurred after the end of Prohibition, and in 1940 the Student Union Building (now Strand Union Building) was built to provide students with a gathering spot on campus that (it was hoped) would keep them away from the saloons downtown. President Strand resigned his office in 1942 to accept the presidency of Oregon State University. (He remained there for 19 years, turning Oregon State into a world-class research and teaching institution.) With Montana still not yet having emerged from the Great Depression, the college struggled to find a new president. Engineering professor William Cobleigh took over as Acting President until from 1942 to 1943 while a replacement for Strand was found. During Cobleigh's year as president, college enrollment plunged as young men entered the armed forces or left to work in war industry plants on the West Coast. Nonetheless, federal funding increased as the United States Department of War sought rapid, significant increases in the number of chemical, engineering, and physics graduates to feed the war effort. =Oregon State College= Strand was elected President of Oregon State College on August 6, 1942. His term of service began on October 15.\\"Dr. A.L. Strand Named President of Oregon State.\\" Montana Standard. August 7, 1942. Strand inherited a college somewhat adrift. President George W. Peavy had retired in July 1940, and was replaced by Dr. Frank Llewellyn Ballard (vice president overseeing the cooperative extension service). Ballard fell ill and turned over his duties to an administrative council. But as it became clear that his illness was going to be a lengthy one followed by an extensive convalescence, Ballard resigned in 1941. Dr. Francois A. Gilfillan, Dean of Science, was named interim president. Gilfillan remained involved in research in synthetic rubber, and the need for rubber for the war drew his attention more and more. After a nationwide search, the state commissioners of higher education awarded the presidency to Strand. Strand was an autocratic leader asked for little input from his administrators or the student body, little appreciated advice, and reacted defensively when challenged. Nonetheless, his governance style fit well with most of the period in which he served as president. Enrollment at OSC fell by half during his first year in office as young men enlisted or were drafted into the armed forces. OSC's key location near the West Coast and relative safety inland from widely anticipated Imperial Japanese attack made it an ideal location for military research and training, and the United States Army seized many campus buildings for the duration of the national emergency. Once the war ended, however, Strand rapidly rebuilt Oregon State. Between 1945 and 1960, enrollment doubled. An firm believer in scientific research, Strand pushed faculty at OSC to engage in research and for faculty and the university to apply for federal research grant funding. To support this effort, he created the Science Research Institute to receive this funding, and added new research laboratories to study transportation and water resources. Much of Strand's focus was on the School of Science, which became the largest school at Oregon State. The School of Science rapidly expanded its curriculum and course offerings, and added departments of natural resources, oceanography, and statistics. His effort was largely successful, as Oregon State became one of the most active research universities in the nation. Strand won legislative approval to expand the School of Education, School of Pharmacy, and School of Science; build a new School of Business and Technology and a new School of Humanities and Social Sciences; and designate the school as a university and rename it Oregon State University. He also created the university's first undergraduate honors program, and constructed a startling 25 new buildings on campus. Among these was the $2.38 million Valley Library and the $5 million engineering-physics building. Also constructed during his tenure was Gill Coliseum and Parker Stadium. A major scandal rocked Oregon State University in 1949. In February, Strand summarily fired untenured professor of chemistry Ralph Spitzer and untenured professor of economics L. R. LaVallee. Neither was given a reason for their dismissal, but Strand believed that both individuals were communists and working with the Soviet Union to undermine not only Oregon State but the United States. (In particular, Strand was outraged that Spitzer supported the environmentally acquired genetic inheritance theories of Soviet scientist Trofim Lysenko.) By the end of February, Strand found himself the target of several scathing attacks, although most of the public, faculty, and student body supported him. Among those critical of the terminations were Sidney Hook and Linus Pauling. Strand's replies to these critics (and he responded to a great many of them) were often rude, condescending, and offensive. Although the \\"Spitzer affair\\" quieted down after a year or two, Pauling refused all invitations to visit Oregon State for decades. Shortly after the incident ended, writer Bernard Malamud visited the campus to conduct research for a novel about the \\"Spitzer affair\\". He used this research for his 1961 novel A New Life. =Death= A.L. Strand died April 27, 1980, in a nursing home in Corvallis, Oregon, after an extended illness.Peterson, Erlene. \\"Class Notes.\\" Minnesota. 80:1 (September 1980), p. 44. Memberships and honors Strand served on the Council of Presidents of the American Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges (now known as the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities), and served for a time as the council's chairman. He also served for a time on the board of directors of the Foundation for American Agriculture. In 1957, Montana State College honored Strand with a Doctor of Laws honorary degree. He was also an active member of the Rotary Club, and president of the Bozeman Rotary in 1942.\\"Rotary to Hold Meet May 10.\\" Montana Standard. May 3, 1942.

The car used a naturally-aspirated 4-litre BMW V8 engine throughout its racing life. The car proved to be uncompetitive, and its fastest race laps were frequently well off the pace of the other runners. Racing history The Argo P made its competitive debut at the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1997, which was the opening round of the IMSA GT Championship; Davin Racing entered Mark Montgomery, Edd Davin and Butch Brickell in the car. It was not a successful debut; the car was still running at the end of the race, but it had only completed 279 laps, which saw the team finish 57th overall, and 11th in the WSC class. Davin and Montgomery were selected to drive the car in the following race, which was the 12 Hours of Sebring, but the team did not actually attend the event. The pair were also entered in the Grand Prix of Atlanta, but finished down in 16th; their fastest lap, a 1:26.699, was nearly six seconds slower than the next-slowest car. The Lime Rock Grand Prix was similarly unsuccessful; Montgomery and Davin finished 14th, and second-to-last, with a fastest lap that was 4.8 seconds slower than any other car. The team persevered with the car for the next event, which was the Six Hours at the Glen; an accident after 46 laps forced them out of the race, and resulted in Davin and Montgomery being classified 37th overall, and 15th in the WSC category. At the Californian Grand Prix, the car lasted for just eleven laps, before differential failure forced the team out, and saw them classified in 18th. Davin drove the Argo P on his own at the Mosport Festival, but steering failure after just one lap forced him to retire the car. After seven unsuccessful races, Davin Racing replaced the Argo P with a Buick-engined Kudzu DLM for the Grand Prix of Las Vegas, and the Argo P was never raced again.

History Though the county unit system had informally been used since 1898, it was formally enacted by the Neill Primary Act of 1917. The system was ostensibly designed to function similarly to the Electoral College, but in practice the large ratio of unit votes for small, rural counties to unit votes for more populous urban areas provided outsized political influence to the smaller counties. For most of the period this system was in effect, the Democratic Party was the single dominant party in state politics. Democratic nominees frequently ran unopposed or with only token opposition in general elections, so the Democratic primary election usually determined the eventual officeholder. This was combined with other devices, such as white primaries, to make sure that only the votes of White rural voters would be reflected in statewide elections. Organization Under the county unit system, the 159 counties in Georgia were divided by population into three categories. The largest eight counties were classified as \\"Urban\\", the next-largest 30 counties were classified as \\"Town\\", and the remaining 121 counties were classified as \\"Rural\\". Urban counties were given 6 unit votes, Town counties were given 4 unit votes, and Rural counties were given 2 unit votes, for a total of 410 available unit votes. Each county's unit votes were awarded on a winner-take-all basis. Candidates were required to obtain a majority of unit votes (not necessarily a majority of the popular vote), or 206 total unit votes, to win the election. If no candidate received a majority in the initial primary, a runoff election was held between the top two candidates to determine a winner. Controversy The county unit system generated great controversy due to the fact that it gave the votes of counties with smaller populations a significantly greater weight than counties with larger populations. For at least the final two decades the system was in use, a majority of statewide unit votes were controlled by counties that, collectively, had less than one-third of the state's total population. Because of this, statewide candidates for office could (and frequently did) win the primary by winning the county unit vote while losing the overall popular vote, sometimes by large margins. This also gave rise to kingmakers such as Roy V. Harris, who were known for their ability to deliver the unit votes of many rural counties. One of the most controversial elections of the county unit system era was the 1946 Democratic gubernatorial primary. By winning a large number of rural counties, Eugene Talmadge garnered a nearly 60% majority of the statewide county unit votes and won the primary, even though he lost the popular vote by 16,144 votes to James V. Carmichael, who himself only won a plurality, not a majority, of the popular vote. Legal challenges and overturning Several lawsuits were filed in the 1940s and 1950s challenging the constitutionality of the system. These lawsuits were rejected by the Supreme Court on the grounds that apportionment issues should be handled by individual states. In 1962, however, the Supreme Court reversed its opinion, ruling in the Tennessee case of Baker v. Carr that redistricting issues present justiciable questions, thus enabling federal courts to intervene in and to decide reapportionment cases. Following the 1962 Baker v. Carr decision, James Sanders, a voter in Fulton County, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for Northern Georgia which challenged the legality of the county unit system. James H. Gray, the chairman of the State Executive Committee of the Democratic Party, was one of the defendants named in the suit. Judge Griffin Bell ruled in Sanders' favor, issuing an injunction against using the system just months before the 1962 gubernatorial primary. Gray appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which on March 8, 1963, rendered a decision by a vote of 8‚Äì1 declaring the county unit system unconstitutional in its current form. In the majority opinion, Justice William O. Douglas wrote, \\"The concept of political equality ... can mean only one thing‚Äîone person, one vote.\\" The Gray v. Sanders case was the first \\"one person, one vote\\" decision handed down by the Supreme Court. Aftermath Due to the court's injunction of the county unit system in 1962, that year's Democratic gubernatorial primary was the first to be decided by popular vote since 1908. It was won by Carl Sanders of Augusta, who would go on to win unopposed in the general election in November. Sanders was the first person from an urban county (Richmond) to be elected governor since the 1920s. Following the 1963 Gray v. Sanders decision, the Georgia Legislature had the option to redesign the county unit system to meet the new \\"one person, one vote\\" standard. The legislature chose, instead, to continue electing statewide offices by popular vote, which continues to the present day. The newly elected Governor Sanders also spearheaded a massive reapportionment of Georgia's General Assembly and 10 U.S. Congressional districts, providing more proportional representation to the state's urban areas.

The company is based in Long Island, New York and was founded in 1954.Lowerson, John (2005). Amateur Operatics: A Social and Cultural History, p. 230. Manchester University PressDelatiner, Barbara (16 November 2003). \\"Big Birthday for Gilbert & Sullivan Troupe\\". New York Times. Retrieved 31 August 2013. History There had been Gilbert & Sullivan performances on Long Island since at least the 1920s, ranging from school shows to community-theater productions. But there had never been an ongoing Gilbert & Sullivan company in the area until the Gilbert & Sullivan Workshop was formed in 1953/1954. It was almost inevitable that, if such a group formed, brothers-in-law Norman ‚ÄúBuddy‚Äù Packer and Martin ‚ÄúMarty‚Äù Waters would be at the heart of it. Waters had been in London in 1939, attending the Royal Academy of Physicians and Surgeons, and when he came home he brought with him a stack of 78-rpm records‚ÄîRuddigore, as recorded by the D‚ÄôOyly Carte Opera Company. He played them for his brother-in-law, and Packer became a lifelong convert. By 1953, when he and his wife, Ruth, moved to Merrick and settled down next door to his brother-in-law, Packer was a confirmed Savoyard. He‚Äôd served as vice president of the New York Gilbert & Sullivan Society, and even produced a televised version of The Mikado in 1949. When Helen Marx, president of the Camp Avenue School PTA, asked him if he could organize a fundraiser, his thoughts turned‚Äîas they so often did‚Äîto Gilbert & Sullivan. Initially the idea was for Packer and Waters to run an adult-education class in G&S; that would culminate in a performance of The Mikado. But when Packer recruited an old friend, Sally Buckstone of Oceanside, to sing, the seeds of a new group were planted. Buckstone was a fine singer but also a talented director, and when The Mikado was presented in Spring 1954, it was so well-received that momentum took over. The Gilbert & Sullivan Workshop of Long Island was born the next year, when the same team presented H.M.S. Pinafore in Merrick, and then The Pirates of Penzance in 1956. The Camp Avenue PTA had benefited so much from The Mikado and its successors that soon other schools were inquiring into the possibility of getting performances of their own. Buckstone, Packer and Waters were eager to expand their season and broaden their performer base, and by the early 1960s the Workshop was a full-fledged touring group, performing throughout Nassau County, and making gradual incursions into Suffolk County and Queens as well. During those same years, the Workshop expanded its repertoire to include Trial by Jury, Patience, Iolanthe and Ruddigore. It would not be until 1975 that it performed The Gondoliers for the first time, however, and not until 1979 that it first staged The Sorcerer. Buckstone, Packer and Waters continued to be mainstays of the group as it moved into the 1970s. In 1977 the Workshop left its longtime home at the Old Mill Road School in Merrick, taking up residence at the Roland Chatterton School in Merrick, which remains its Tuesday-night home to the present day. The 1980s brought major changes to the group, beginning with its name: In 1980, due to a consensus that the group had evolved into something larger in scope and more professional than the word ‚ÄúWorkshop‚Äù suggested, the group‚Äôs name was officially changed to The Gilbert & Sullivan Light Opera Company of Long Island. Two years later the first of the three founding members left the group, as Norman ‚ÄúBuddy‚Äù Packer retired to Coconut Creek, Fla., where he still lives today at 85. Martin ‚ÄúMarty‚Äù Waters performed his final show with the Company in 1984, and a few years later moved south as well; today, at 86, he lives with his wife, Billie, in Baton Rouge, La. Sally Buckstone continued to direct with the Company until the mid-1990s, before relocating to Pembroke Pines, Fla. The most striking aspect of the 1980s was the development of the Yiddish division of the Company in 1984. Initially a novelty fund-raiser, Der Shirtz (a 30-minute Yiddish version of H.M.S. Pinafore) blossomed into a whole new group. Under the leadership of longtime Company stalwarts Al Grand, Bob Tartell and Elaine Lerner, and directed by Sally Buckstone, what eventually became the Gilbert & Sullivan Yiddish Light Opera Company of Long Island developed Der Yiddisher Pinafore, Di Yam Gazlonim (Pirates of Penzance) and Der Yiddisher Mikado, Yiddish versions of the beloved ‚ÄúBig Three‚Äù Savoy operas. The group's critically acclaimed productions melded Victorian satire with Jewish humor, while preserving the lovely music and spirit of the original works. Jewish experiences and idioms were woven into the original plots, which added a rich dimension to the existing humor and wit. Hearing Britishisms coming out as Yiddishisms made people roar with laughter!

Touring nationally and internationally, it marked out a unique corner of the Gilbert & Sullivan universe and made it its own. Two landmarks defined the 1990s for the Company: One was the development of the Gilbert & Sullivan Light Opera Orchestra of Long Island, under the direction first of founding music director Raymond J. Osnato and then several other conductors. The Company had occasionally recruited orchestras for performances in the 1960s and 1970s, but had never had an orchestra of its own. Beginning in 1992, however, the Company made it a priority to develop its own orchestra, beginning with a tiny ensemble of six and slowly growing with the passing years. Many of the orchestra members have returned again and again to the Light Opera Orchestra, which is now in its 12th year. 1992 also saw the launching of ‚ÄúThe Savoy Project: or, Gilbert & Sullivan from A to Z.‚Äù Spurred by a desire to try new projects and convinced that it had been depending too much upon ‚Äúthe Big Three,‚Äù the Company undertook a complete cycle of the works of Gilbert & Sullivan, beginning with Princess Ida in 1992 and concluding in 2004 with The Mikado. The Project, which has been an overwhelming success, has featured the Long Island premieres of four operas‚ÄîPrincess Ida, The Yeomen of the Guard, Utopia, Limited and The Grand Duke, as well as of the Sullivan/Stephenson operetta The Zoo. In 1995 the Company presented the world premiere of Gayden Wren‚Äôs A Gilbert & Sullivan Christmas Carol. The premiere sold out, prompting the Company to revive it as a season fund-raiser for several years thereafter. The show, which tells the Charles Dickens story with new lyrics set to Gilbert & Sullivan songs, went on to score a hit Off-Broadway in 2001, and has now been staged more than 50 times throughout the United States and by groups in Canada, Great Britain and Macedonia.

RFIDs offer longer range and ability to be automated, unlike barcodes that require a human operator for interrogation. The main challenge to their adoption is the cost of RFIDs. The design and fabrication of ASICs needed for RFID are the major component of their cost, so removing ICs altogether can significantly reduce its cost. The major challenges in designing chipless RFID is data encoding and transmission.Radio Frequency Identification and Sensors: From RFID to Chipless RFID, Etienne Perret, Wiley- ISTE, 2014 Development of chipless RFID tags Chipless tag printed with inkjet printing conductive ink. To understand the development of chipless RFID tags, it is important to view it in comparison to classic RFID and barcode. RFID benefits from a very wide spectrum of functionalities, related to the use of radio-frequency (RF) waves for data exchange. The acquisition of the identifier (ID) is made much easier and volumetric readings are possible, all on tags containing modifiable information. These functions are impossible to implement with a barcode, but in reality, 70% of the items manufactured worldwide are equipped with it. The reasons for this enthusiasm are simple: barcode functions very well and is extremely cheap, the label as well as the reader. This is why barcodes remain the uncontested benchmark in terms of identification, with a cost-to-simplicity-of-use ratio that remains unequalled. It is also true that RFID contributes other significant functionalities, and the question is therefore one of imagining a technology based on RF waves as a communication vector that would retain some of the advantages of barcodes. Pragmatically speaking, the question of system cost, and particularly of the tags that must be produced in large numbers, remains the central point. Due to the presence of electronic circuits, these tags have a non-negligible cost that is a very great deal higher than that of barcodes. It is logical therefore that a simple solution consists of producing chipless RF tags. The high cost of RFID tags is actually one of the principal reasons that chipped RFID is rare in the market for tags for widely distributed products, a market that numbers in the tens of thousands of billions of units sold per year. In this market, optic barcodes are very widely used. However, technically speaking, chipped RFID offers significant advantages including increased reading distance and the ability to detect a target outside the field of vision, whatever its position. The concept of chipless RF label has been developed with the idea of competing with barcodes in certain areas of application. RFID has many arguments in its favor in terms of functionality, the only problem remaining being the price. The barcode offers no other feature than the ID recovery; however, the technology is time-tasted, widespread, and extremely low cost. Chipless RFID has also good arguments in terms of functionality. Some functionalities are degraded versions of what RFID can do (read range / reading flexibility are reduced ...), others seem to be even more relevant in chipless (discretion, product integrity of the tag). The main advantage is the cost of chipless tags. As compared to the barcodes, the chipless technology must bring other features that are impossible to implement with the optical approach, while remaining a very low cost approach, that is to say, a potentially printable one. This is why the writing / rewriting and sensor capabilities are crucial features for the large-scale development of such a technology. For instance, the development of very low cost sensor - tags is now eagerly awaited for, for application reasons.La RFID sans puce - Th√©orie, conception, mesures, Arnaud Vena, Etienne Perret, Smail Tedjini, ISTE, 2016 Operating principle Chipless rfid operating principle. A. Vena, E. Perret, and S. Tedjini, 2013. Like various existing RFID technologies, chipless RFID tags are associated with a specific RF reader, which questions the tag and recovers the information contained in it. The operating principle of the reader is based on the emission of a specific electromagnetic (EM) signal toward the tag, and the capture of the signal reflected by the tag. The processing of the signal received‚Äînotably via a decoding stage‚Äîmakes it possible to recover the information contained in the tag.RCS Synthesis for Chipless RFID - Theory and Design, Olivier Rance, Etienne Perret, Romain Siragusa, Pierre Lemaitre-Auger, ISTE-Elsevier Jul. 2017 However, chipless RFID tags are fundamentally different from RFID tags. In the latter, a specific frame is sent by the readerChipless RFID Reader Design for Ultra-Wideband Technology, Marco Garbati, Etienne Perret, Romain Siragusa, ISTE-Elsevier, Fev. 2018. toward the tag according to a classic binary modulation schema. The tag demodulates this signal, processes the request, possibly writes data in its memory, and sends back a response, modulating its load.Chipless RFID based on RF Encoding Particle - Realization, Coding and Reading System, Arnaud Vena, Etienne Perret, Smail Tedjini, ISTE- Elsevier, Aug. 2016. Chipless RFID tags, on the other hand, function without a communication protocol. They employ a grid of dipole antennas that are tuned to different frequencies. The interrogator generates a frequency sweep signal and scans for signal dips. Each dipole antenna can encode one bit. The frequency swept will be determined by the antenna length. They can be viewed as radar targets possessing a specific, stationary temporal or frequential signature. With this technology, the remote reading of an identifier consists of analyzing the radar signature of the tag. Currently, one of main challenges of the chipless technology is the robustness of tag detection in different environments. It is useless to try to increase the quantity of information that a chipless tag can have if the tag ID cannot be read properly in real environments and without complex calibration techniques. The detection of a chipless tag in noisy environments is much more difficult in chipless than in UHF RFID due to the absence of modulation in time, that is, the absence of two different states in the backscattering signal. =Chemical-based= Self- generating ceramic mixtures In 2001, Roke Manor Research centre announced materials that emit characteristic radiation when moved. These may be exploited for storage of a few data bits encoded in the presence or absence of certain chemicals. =Biocompatible ink= Somark employed a dielectric barcode that may be read using microwaves. The dielectric material reflects, transmits and scatters the incident radiation; the different position and orientation of these bars affects the incident radiation differently and thus encodes the spatial arrangement in the reflected wave. The dielectric material may be dispersed in a fluid to create a dielectric ink. They were mainly used as tags for cattle, which were \\"painted\\" using a special needle. The ink may be visible or invisible according to the nature of the dielectric, Operating frequency of the tag may be changed by using different dielectrics. CrossID nanometric ink This system uses varying magnetism. Materials resonate at different frequencies when excited by radiation. The reader analyzes the spectrum of the reflected signal to identify the materials. 70 different materials were found. Each material's presence or absence may be used to encode a bit, enabling encoding up to 270 unique binary strings. They work on frequencies between three and ten gigahertz. =Passive antenna= In 2004 Tapemark announced a chipless RFID that will have only a passive antenna with a diameter as small as 5 ¬µm. The antenna consists of small fibers called nano-resonant structures. Spatial difference in structure encode data. The interrogator sends out a coherent pulse and reads back an interference pattern that it decodes to identify a tag. They work from 24 GHz‚Äì60 GHz. Tapemark later discontinued this technology. =Magnetism-based = Programmable magnetic resonance Sagentia's devices are acousto-magnetic. They exploit the resonance features of magnetically soft magnetostrictive materials and the data retention capability of hard magnetic materials. Data is written to the card using the contact method. The resonance of the magnetostrictive material is altered by the data stored in the hard material. Harmonics may be enabled or disabled corresponding to the state of the hard material, thus encoding the device state as a spectral signature. Tags built by Sagentia for AstraZeneca fall into this category. =Magnetic data tagging= Flying Null technology uses a series of passive magnetic structures, much like the lines used in conventional barcodes. These structures are made of soft magnetic material. The interrogator contains two permanent magnets with like poles. The resulting magnetic field has a null volume in the centre. Additionally, interrogating radiation is used. The magnetic field created by the interrogator is such that it drives the soft material to saturation except when it is at the null volume. When in the null volume the soft magnet interacts with the interrogating radiation thus giving away the position of the soft material. Spatial resolution of more than 50 Œºm may be attained. =Surface acoustic wave= Illustration of a simple SAW RFID encoding 013 in base 4. The first and last reflectors are used for calibration. The second and second last for error detection. The data is encoded in the remaining three groups. Each group contains 4 slots and an empty slot followed by another group. Surface acoustic wave devices consists of a piezoelectric crystal-like lithium niobate on which transducers are made by single-metal-layer photolithographic technology. The transducers usually are Inter-Digital Transducers (IDT), which have a two- toothed comb-like structure. An antenna is attached to the IDT for reception and transmission. The transducers convert the incident radio wave to surface acoustic waves that travel on the crystal surface until it reaches the encoding reflectors that reflect some waves and transmit the rest. The IDT collects the reflected waves and transmits them to the reader. The first and last reflectors are used for calibration as the response may be affected by physical parameters such as temperature. A pair of reflectors may also be used for error correction. The reflections increase in size from nearest to farthest of the IDT to account for losses due to preceding reflectors and wave attenuation. Data is encoded using Pulse Position Modulation (PPM). The crystal is logically divided into groups, such that each group typically has a length equal to the inverse of the bandwidth. Each group is divided into slots of equal width. The reflector may be placed in any slot. The last slot in each group is usually unused, leaving n-1 positions for the reflector, thus encoding n-1 states. The repetition rate of the PPM is equal to the system bandwidth. The reflector's slot position may be used to encode phase. The devices' temperature dependence means they can also act as temperature sensors. =Capacitively tuned split microstrip resonators= They employ a grid of dipole antennas that are tuned to different frequencies. The interrogator generates a frequency sweep signal and scans for signal dips. Each dipole antenna can encode one bit. The frequency swept will be determined by the antenna length. New trends Paper chipless tag printed with flexography technique. Many improvements have been done in the past few years on communication systems, based on electronic devices where an integrated circuit is at the heart of the whole system. The democratization of these chipped based systems like the RFID one have however given rise to environmental issues. Lately, new research projects, such as European Research Council (ERC) funded project ScattererID,ScattererID Analysis and synthesis of wideband scattered signals from finite-size targets ‚Äì aspect-independent RF analog footprint, Etienne Perret, 2018. have introduced the paradigm of RF communication system based on chipless labels, where new useful functionalities can be added. With comparable costs to a barcode, these labels should stand out by providing more functionalities than the optical approach. The objective of ScattererID project is to show that it is possible to associate the chipless label ID with other features like the ability to write and rewrite the information, to associate an ID with a sensor function and to associate an ID with gesture recognition. The possibility of designing reconfigurable and low cost tags involves the development of original approaches at the forefront of progress, like the use of CBRAM from microelectronics, allowing to achieve reconfigurable elements based on Nano- switches.

It originally aired on MTV on May 31, 2006. In the episode, Lauren Conrad and Heidi Montag move into an apartment in Los Angeles. Conrad befriends fellow Teen Vogue intern Whitney Port, while Montag bonds with their neighbor Audrina Patridge. Conrad is later scolded after Montag and her companions arrive uninvited to a corporate event. \\"New City, New Drama\\" was produced by Tony DiSanto, Adam DiVello, Liz Gateley, Colin Nash, and Andrew Perry. The episode received generally favorable reviews from critics, who appreciated its plotline and production. According to Nielsen ratings, it was watched by 2.9 million viewers. The episode was released on DVD on February 13, 2007, packaged with the remainder of the first season. Plot Lauren and her housemate Heidi move into their shared apartment in Los Angeles. Shortly after arriving, Lauren's interview for an internship with Teen Vogue is unexpectedly changed to an earlier time. While Lauren meets with the magazine's West Coast editor Lisa Love, Heidi befriends their neighbor Audrina. That evening, the women, Heidi's boyfriend Jordan Eubanks, and his roommate Brian Drolet eat dinner at the sushi restaurant Geisha House. The following morning, Lauren and Heidi meet with the administrators at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising. While Lauren impresses her superiors, they question if Heidi is prepared for college. Upon returning home, Blaine Zuckerman calls Lauren on behalf of Teen Vogue and offers her an internship with the magazine. On her first day, she befriends another intern Whitney, and the two begin preparing for the launch party of Teen Vogues \\"Hollywood\\" edition. As Lauren and Whitney learn that they will be working during the party, Heidi wants to attend the event, which Lauren is unwilling to risk her internship for. Nonetheless, as Heidi, Audrina, Jordan, and Brian arrive unexpectedly that evening, Lauren and Whitney allow the group in. Blaine and Lisa scold Lauren for an argument between Heidi and Jordan, in addition to allowing the group to sit in a reserved seating area. Lisa tells her that they will \\"discuss this on Monday\\". Production After the first two seasons of Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County enjoyed continued ratings success, MTV approved production of the spin- off series The Hills in 2005. Like its predecessor, the reality television program was filmed in a narrative format more commonly seen in soap operas. Conrad, who served as the parent series' first season narrator, became the focal point of the show as she moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in the fashion industry. The pilot episode introduced three additional primary cast members. Montag, who was previously featured on Laguna Beach in a limited capacity, became Conrad's housemate by the time production had begun on the first season of The Hills. On the series, it was depicted as if Montag had befriended Patridge by her own doing, though Patridge claimed that a producer offered her a position on the series to become friends with Conrad and Montag. Port was introduced to the series as Conrad's co-intern at Teen Vogue. \\"New City, New Drama\\" was produced by Tony DiSanto, Adam DiVello, Liz Gateley, Colin Nash, and Andrew Perry. The latter four individuals had previously served as producers for Laguna Beach. DiVello and Gateley served as the series' executive producers until its conclusion in July 2010. Reception and release \\"New City, New Drama\\" was met with generally favorable reviews from critics, who appreciated its plotline and production. Kelly West from Television Blend noted that The Hills commented that MTV \\"[keeps] things simple\\", noting the similarities it shares with Laguna Beach, but given the network's success with reality programming since the 1990s, opined that the series was \\"sure to be as much of a hit\\" as its predecessor. Writing for The New York Times, Virginia Heffernan enjoyed watching \\"charmed\\" work experiences and the \\"hammy deadbeat\\" Montag, further stating that she saw the program as being more fictional than reality. Kara Medalis of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said that she missed Kristin Cavallari from Laguna Beach, but enjoyed Montag as \\"the new troublemaker in [Conrad's] life\\". In its original broadcast in the United States on May 31, 2006, \\"New City, New Drama\\" was watched by 2.9 million viewers. The remainder of the season maintained a steady viewership of about two million viewers for each weekly episode, and was subsequently picked up for a second season. In the country, the first season was released as a two-disc DVD set on February 13, 2007.

It was screened in the Gala Presentation section at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot Croyden is an upscale college preparatory school in Maine that hires teachers for their advanced courses who are accomplished professionals. Jack Marcus is a writer and poet who teaches the advanced writing class. He's a good teacher who inspires his students. He demonstrates how some carefully chosen words and phrases can stimulate the listener's imagination to produce vivid mental imagery. One particular grievance of his involves the way in which young developing minds have been hijacked by the tedious distractions of modern technical gadgetry. He seems to be afflicted with writer's block and hasn't come out with any original work in several years. He publishes the school's literary magazine, which the school administration is planning to shut down for budgetary reasons. He is a high- functioning alcoholic who chronically arrives late to work and is on the verge of being fired. He is divorced and has an adult son from his first marriage, but they have become estranged because of Jack's drinking and general irresponsibility. Dina Delsanto is an artist who has just been hired to teach the advanced art class, which has the same students as Jack's writing class. Dina was a successful painter in New York City, but she now has difficulty painting or even walking and engaging in daily activities because of severe rheumatoid arthritis. She can no longer fasten buttons, open medicine bottles or hold paint brushes. She moved to Maine, where her sister and her mother live, so that they can help her during the spells when her arthritis worsens. As a teacher, she is a perfectionist with no interest in her students' personal lives. She simply wants them to concentrate on creating the best works of art that they can. She shows them the difference between paintings that merely demonstrate craft and paintings that evoke feeling as well. She struggles to paint again by overcoming her physical limitations as well as her own artistic difficulties. She finally creates a good work of art and sets it aside to dry. She has, incidentally, professed a complete disdain for the spoken and printed word. She insists that artistically rendered images are the only worthwhile media for expressing \\"truth\\". Jack's colleagues and friends perceive him as attention-getting, obnoxious and charming. Once he gets wind of Dina's personal philosophy, he provokes an argument with her over which is more important, words or pictures. Their students are drawn into the conflict with class assignments demonstrating the superiority of words over pictures or pictures over words. Dina agrees to have her students contribute their own works of art to Jack's literary magazine. They decide to have an assembly in which each side will put on a presentation arguing the case for words and for pictures. The school administration becomes impressed enough with all of this activity to retain his services as an instructor. Jack pursues Dina romantically and ultimately succeeds. But, during his first night over, he gets drunk on her vodka and crashes headlong into her newest painting. He further confesses to plagiarizing a poem from his own son, a moral failing for which Dina is even more unforgiving. She throws him out and tells him she doesn't want to have anything more to do with him. He confesses the plagiarism to the school board and hands in his resignation. He asks only to continue for the rest of the year and put on the War on Words and Pictures assembly program. The board grants him his request, and the movie concludes with a satisfying resolution at the aforementioned assembly.

The site's critical consensus reads: \\"While both talented performers in their own right, Juliette Binoche and Clive Owen are decidedly mismatched in Words and Pictures, and they aren't done many favors by the movie's awkwardly constructed screenplay.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 49 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Odie Henderson of RogerEbert.com gave the film only one and a half stars and wrote: \\"Unfortunately, ‚ÄòWords and Pictures‚Äô fails at portraying both titular nouns. The screenplay by Gerald Di Pego (\\"Phenomenon\\") is full of subpar dialogue, one-dimensional characters, scenes that belong in a different movie, other scenes that belong in the trash, multiple rom-com sins of clich√© and a warped, stalkerish notion of what constitutes romance. When the hero's idea of a term of endearment to the heroine is \\"you cold-hearted ice bitch,\\" one wonders what he'd say if he were pissed at her.\\" Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"Schepisi, whose last film was his adaptation The Eye of the Storm, based on an Australian classic, is a general who marshals actors to bring emotional depth to almost any kind of screenplay. Here the human elements take the foreground, and romance comes trailing along forlornly behind. Not that the chemistry isn't there between Owen and Binoche, who has rarely looked so beautiful onscreen, even playing a woman with physical handicaps. But the strange reticence of the scene when the two finally hit the hay feels like a throwback to the 1930s, including a huge cutaway that ends with the protags in bed with the sheets pulled up to their necks, saying how great it all was.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today gave Words and Pictures three and half stars and stated: \\"A thoughtful film about ideas ‚Äî creativity, the power of language and the eloquence of visuals ‚Äî it features two impeccable performances full of vitality. Clive Owen plays Jack Marcus, a voluble prep school English teacher who laments the reductive nature of social media. Juliette Binoche is Dina Delsanto, an Italian-born expressionist painter and art instructor at the same elite New England school. Both are disillusioned with life and education, and neither suffers fools. They are tart-tongued and cantankerous, but engaging. Kyle Smith of New York Post gave the film only one out of four stars and wrote: \\"Predictability ensues in '80s-rom-com style ‚Äî he's words, she's pictures, get it? ‚Äî as everyone pretends the cloddish dialogue is witty.\\" References External links  * * Words and Pictures film trailer at YouTube Category:2013 films Category:2013 drama films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Fred Schepisi Category:Films about educators Category:Films about fictional painters Category:Films about writers Category:Roadside Attractions films Category:Films about alcoholism Category:Films shot in British Columbia ","title":"Words and Pictures (film)"},{"id":"40259613","text":"Qovaq-e Olya or Qavaq-e Olya () may refer to: * Qavaq-e Olya, East Azerbaijan * Qovaq-e Olya, Zanjan ","title":"Qovaq-e Olya"},{"id":"40259617","text":"Words and Pictures can refer to: * Words & Pictures, a British art magazine in the 1990s * Words and Pictures (album), a 1997 album by Bob Snider * Words and Pictures (film), a 2013 American film * Words and Pictures (TV programme), a British children's television series that ran from 1970 onwards on BBC * Words and Pictures, a 2011 album by Nu:Tone ","title":"Words and Pictures"},{"id":"40259618","text":"Qovaq-e Sofla or Qavaq-e Sofla () may refer to: * Qavaq-e Sofla, East Azerbaijan * Qovaq-e Sofla, Zanjan ","title":"Qovaq-e Sofla"},{"id":"40259627","text":"Qovaq or Qavaq (), also known as Qaraq, may refer to: * Qovaq-e Olya (disambiguation) * Qovaq-e Sofla (disambiguation) ","title":"Qovaq"},{"id":"40259642","text":"Quzijaq-e Olya (, also Romanized as Q≈´zƒ´jƒÅq-e ‚ÄòOlyƒÅ) is a village in Anguran Rural District, Anguran District, Mahneshan County, Zanjan Province, Iran.

Chinese architecture Underside of roof overhang of the Imperial Palace reconstuction at the Royal Ontario Museum The bright colors, carvings and terra cotta tiles are all reflective of the Qing Dynasty. The architecture of this time period is also filled with symbolism, as with most eras in Chinese architecture. Traditionally, wooden buildings were a place for the living to use while stone construction was used to house the dead (see ROM's Ming Tomb). The hall was built using the traditional methods and materials of Ancient Chinese wooden architecture. The original palace is 5 bays wide and 4 bays deep. A \\"bay\\" is the space between each large support column. This unique construction allows for the columns to support the weight of the roof without the need for any load bearing walls. Architectural features of note are the dougong, which are the brightly painted bracket clusters supporting the tile roof, which were carved using traditional methods. The glazed roof tiles and dragon figures are representative of temple decoration.

First noted southeast of Guam on July 31, development of this system was initially slow to occur; it was first classified on August 5, and was upgraded into a tropical storm the next day. Intensification was rapid as Abby slowly recurved northward on August 7 and 8. After reaching peak intensity with winds of early on August 9, Abby slowly weakened, though the storm briefly re-intensified on August 11\\\\. By August 14, winds had diminished to . Abby finally weakened back into a tropical storm on August 17 not long after making landfall in Japan. The following day, Abby completed the transition to an extratropical cyclone after moving through central Japan. However, meteorologists continued monitoring the storm for six more days. In the Philippines, heavy rainfall resulted in a landslide that crushed a house in Manila, killing three people. Two others drowned due to rough seas. Typhoon Abby also brought several consecutive days of rain to southern and central Japan, resulting in widespread damage. Commercial traffic by land, sea, and air was also paralyzed by the cyclone, stranding 25,900. Moreover, over 10,000 fishing boats took refuge in harbors. Around 3,400 homes were flooded and 24 homes were either damaged or destroyed. Additionally, 89 roads were also damaged. About a dozen people were injured during a flash flood that destroyed three houses. Three more dwellings were washed away when a river overflowed its banks. Nationwide, 27 people were hurt and two persons were killed. One person was listed as missing. Meteorological history Typhoon Abby originated from an area of enhanced convective activity southeast of Guam on July 31\\\\. While moving south of Guam, the area failed to organized significantly until August 3, when thunderstorm activity increased in coverage. Based on this, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued at 2300 UTC. Initially, the system struggled to develop a closed atmospheric circulation. However, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated the system early on August 5 and was able to locate a closed surface circulation. Based on this, both the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system into a tropical depression. Following an increase in organization, both agencies upgraded the system into a tropical storm. Although forecast by the JTWC to move west, Abby instead veered west-northwest while slowly deepening. At 1800 UTC on August 6, both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded Abby to typhoon status when an eye began to form within the central dense overcast, a large mass of deep convection. On August 7, the storm began to intensify at a much faster rate than expected by the JTWC. Later that day, the JMA estimated 10-minute sustained winds of . After briefly leveling off in intensity, the JTWC reported winds of . Twelve hours later, the JTWC estimated maximum winds of , making Abby a super typhoon. Even though a Hurricane Hunter aircraft measured a pressure of , the JMA estimated peak winds of and a minimum pressure of early on August 9. Typhoon Abby on August 13 After maintaining peak intensity for several hours, Abby began to weaken as its forward speed slowed. Meanwhile, the JTWC forecast the storm to a turn to the northwest around a subtropical ridge. On August 11, JMA reduced the intensity of the storm to , but several hours later, the storm suddenly restrengthened, attaining winds of . However, this trend was short lived and Abby steadily weakened as it made the long anticipated turn to the northeast in the general direction of Japan. On August 12, two tropical cyclones developed in the South China Sea, but due to the massive size of Abby, this had little effect on the typhoon. On August 14, however, the eye of Abby began to become less defined. Based on this, the JTWC decreased the intensity of the storm to while the JMA reported winds of . According to the JMA, the storm maintained its intensity for a day, but on the following day, the storm weakened slightly. By August 16, wind estimates from both agencies were equivalent to Category 1 intensity. Continuing to trek north-northwest, the JTWC downgraded into a tropical storm at 0000 UTC on August 17,. Shortly thereafter, Abby moved ashore Hamamatsu and began to turn northeast, encountering rugged terrain near Tokyo. At noon, the JMA downgraded Abby into a severe tropical storm; simultaneously, the JTWC classified Abby as an extratropical cyclone. However, the JMA did not follow suit until 1800 UTC on August 18\\\\. Despite being extratropical, the JMA kept monitoring the system until August 24. Preparations and impact Prior to affecting Japan, rains partially related to the system affected the Philippines. In Manila, a landslide crushed a house. Three teenagers were killed and two others were injured. Furthermore, two women also drowned due to rough seas. On August 12, although far offshore Japan at that time, high waves were reported along the Pacific coast of Okinawa. Two days later, heavy rains began to drench the nation and continued through August 17. Throughout the storm, three weather stations recorded more than of rain, Amagisan measured a peak total of , Hakone saw , and fell in Lake Yamanaka. Moreover, Amagisan also saw observed 24-hours and hourly totals of and respectively. Typhoon Abby brought widespread damage to Japan, becoming the second storm to strike the country in a week. Ferry services were interrupted to the outer islands of the nation, which stranded 3,900 persons in Yoron. Some local air services were also suspended, stranding 4,000 tourists. Typhoon alerts were necessitated for Shikoku, Kyushu, and Honshu. At least 10,300 fishing boats took refuge in harbors. A swimmer drowned in the lake on the western tip of Honshu; a fisherman was swept away by high waves off Kamogawa. A dozen people were injured during a flash flood that destroyed three houses just west of Tokyo. Three houses were washed away and two people injured when a river west of Tokyo overflowed its banks. Major railway lines halted operations throughout central Japan while many other trains arrived late, leaving 18,000 individuals stranded. Throughout the nation, 24 homes were damaged or destroyed while 3,400 others were flooded, displacing 2,700 persons in eight provinces. In all, 19 bridges and two breakwaters were washed away, which resulted in 83 landslides. Eighty-nine roads were damaged, of which 50 were closed, trapping thousands of travelers. Nationwide, 29 people were hurt. However, only two deaths were attributed from the storm, though one person was missing.

He was also a member of the Parliament of Norway for a total of eight non-consecutive parliamentary terms from 1829 until 1861. Education Jacob von der Lippe was born in Bergen, Norway on 27 September 1797 into a merchant family. After graduating with an Examen artium certificate in 1818, he went on to study theology at the Royal Frederick University in Christiania where he received a Cand.theol. degree in 1819. Career =Priest= His first job after the university was as a curate in Haus, just outside of the city of Bergen in Western Norway. In 1821, he was given the job of parish priest in Sk√•nevik in the far southern part of Hordaland county. He held this job until 1825 when he was transferred to the parish of Avaldsnes on the island of Karm√∏y, just outside of Haugesund. In 1829, he was elected to be the Dean of the Karmsund prosti (deanery) in northern Rogaland county. In 1831, von der Lippe was elected to be the stiftsprost in Kristiansand, one of the highest ranking priests in the Diocese of Christianssand. During this time, he served as the acting Bishop twice. In 1841, the King appointed him to be the Bishop of the diocese. He held that post until his retirement in 1875. He was succeeded by J√∏rgen Moe as bishop. During his time as Bishop, he was characterized as fairly conservative in his beliefs, and he was also thought of as fairly authoritarian. An old story about von der Lippe says that a farmer had met with the bishop, and afterwards exclaimed \\"\\" which means \\"That is the biggest dictator I have ever met!\\". =Politician= He was first elected to the Parliament of Norway in the 1829 Storting election while serving as dean in Avaldsnes. When he moved to Christianssand, he was steadily re-elected to represent that city in the 1832 Storting election, the 1835 Storting election, the 1838 Storting election, and the 1841 Storting election. He declined re-election in 1845, but he did get re-elected in the 1847 Storting election. Again in 1850, he declined to run, but in the 1853 election he was elected again to represent Christianssand. He again decided not to run for re-election in 1857, but two years later in the 1859 Storting election he was elected for his final term in office. When the municipal government law was implemented in 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law), he was elected to the municipal council for the city of Christianssand, a position that he held until 1840. Personal life Jacob von der Lippe was born in Bergen, Norway on 27 September 1797 to parents Gerhard von der Lippe (1776-1830) and Antonette Ulriche Dietrichson (1770-1801). He was married on 5 July 1820 Ingeborg Erichsen (1800-1880). He is the great grandfather to Frits von der Lippe and Jens von der Lippe. He died on 2 October 1878 in the city of Kristiansand, Norway at the age of 81.

It was screened in the Special Presentation section at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival, and in a June 2014 screening at the Greenwich International Film Festival in producer Emily Wachtel's native Stamford, Connecticut. The film received positive reviews from outlets such as Variety, The Hollywood Reporter, ScreenDaily, and The Huffington Post. The film was released theatrically on May 30, 2014, by IFC Films. It was released on DVD on September 20, 2014 and available through Netflix. Plot Ellie Klug is a music critic in her 40s at a dying underground magazine, Stax. Her editor, Giles, (Oliver Platt) assigns Ellie to write a piece on Matthew Smith on the 10th anniversary of his disappearance which most people consider a suicide. Ellie, who was Matthew's childhood sweetheart and who remained with him until his disappearance, is unconvinced that he is dead and decides to track Matthew down. After receiving a tip online as to Matthew Smith's location, Giles gives Ellie a thousand dollars to pay the source. However Ellie is distracted by Lucas Stone, (Ryan Eggold) a struggling musician who is interested in Ellie, and accidentally leaves the money beside him when she leaves to catch her bus. When Ellie ignores his calls, Lucas misinterprets Ellie's actions and uses the money to cut a demo tape, believing that Ellie left him the money as a show of faith. Ellie manages to come up with the money to bribe her source by going to Charlie (Thomas Haden Church), an awkward but wealthy socialite whom she had briefly dated in the past. Charlie agrees to help Ellie if she allows him to film her as part of a documentary on her search for Matthew Smith. Ellie agrees, but the source is a scammer and the documentary quickly falls apart after they run out of leads. Charlie admits he loaned her the money because he was interested in having a relationship with her. Ellie begins dating Lucas, but grows insecure after he begins to experience some success. When he fails to show up for Charlie's wedding Ellie assumes he has left her and sleeps with another man only to have Lucas walk into her room late in the night. He returns the money to her with a note explaining the miscommunication that led to him taking it. After breaking up with Lucas, Ellie spirals into a depression, obsessively watching the video of a man she believes to be Matthew Smith performing a song which she believes is about her. She finally has a breakthrough when she realizes that all of Matthew's old issues of Stax were under his mother's name and discovers while looking through the database at work that the subscription was never cancelled but the delivery address was changed. Ellie and Charlie go to the address listed on the subscription and find it's a bar. When Ellie asks the bartender if she knows Matthew Smith the woman answers in the negative but places a call on a cellphone shortly after. Ellie and Charlie follow her to her home. In the morning she sees a man outside the house and after approaching him she realizes it's Matthew. The two have a short conversation where she realizes that Matthew and the bartender are living together and have a child. When Ellie asks him about the song he was playing he tells her he has no new songs. Ellie and Charlie leave and Charlie gives Ellie all the footage from the documentary. She in turn writes a piece for Giles about Matthew without revealing that he is still alive and leading a quiet and secluded life. The end of the film shows Ellie going out on a date with Charlie.

This network is standard gauge which facilitates compatibility and vehicle interchangeability with other lines built or planned in the Community of Madrid. The main shareholder of the company is Globalviahttps://www.globalvia.com (a Spanish private infrastructure company) with 85%, and then CCM with 15%. The tram is integrated in the Metro Ligero system as ML Line 4.https://www.crtm.es/tu-transporte-publico/metro- ligero.aspx  Project  This is a project promoted by the local administration of Parla. Opened on May 6, 2007 (Phase I), and September 8, 2007 (Phase II), can be the journey between the stations Plaza de Toros to Parla Industrial City until completion of the works of the station North Parla (which is still to be opened and will house a railway interchange with Cercan√≠as Madrid). It consists of a circular line of 15 stations with stops every 500 meters, a total length of 8.3 km (similar to the Montpellier tramway). It connects the city center with new urban developments (Parla Este among them) and points of interest in the city such as the Commissioner of Police, health and cultural centers, shopping centers, etc. There is a connection with the Parla station of Cercan√≠as Madrid located in downtown Parla and in future with a new station in the north of the city. Along with the construction of the tram, there have been \\"park and ride\\" facilities built throughout the city to promote the use of public transport. = Extensions = There were planned to eventually build two more lines, also circular. *\\"Line 2\\" would run to PAU-5, located on the banks of the A-42, to aid in the development of the Parla industrial park. *\\"Line 3\\" would serve the future developments of southern Parla and the hospital and the new commuter train station to be located in the south of the city. However, given the financial crisis facing the city there are many questions about the economic feasibility of extending the system. So far as January 2020, Parla Tram remains with their single line.  Ticketing  10 trip ticket The ticket price is similar to urban bus lines in the city. Madrid regional travel passes are valid (at least B2 zone).  Capacity  Parla Tram uses the Alstom Citadis 302, with a maximum capacity of 220 passengers, being the same amount as three buses. This model is the same used in Trambaix and Trambes√≤s in Barcelona, Tenerife Tram, Murcia Tram and Metro Ligero de Madrid.  Criticism  Parla Tram station. During the first year of operation the tram recorded 2,350,000 passengers and 3,800,000 passengers in the second, coming in 2011 to 5,000,000 passengers, with a weekday average utilization of nearly 20,000 passengers. The satisfaction rate in the survey conducted in 2012 was an 8.64 out of 10. The project has been criticized, because Parla remains a dormitory community of Madrid, and most workers commute to work in neighboring towns due to the small industrial base offered by the city, so improved external connections are critical. Also the current alignment does not connect to key parts of the city such as La Laguna or the South Hospital, these neighborhoods would be connected through future line extensions. Advocates argue that, thanks to the tram, all of Parla is connected to the trains that provide transit to the capital and to allow greater ease in internal displacement that encourages trade, industry and urban tertiary consolidation. Critics assert that Parla does not have the critical mass of citizens to justify a streetcar system, stating that it instead could have solved mobility needs with other means of transport like the bus. Its proponents argue that the huge demand that occurs during rush hour, with figures in the environment of the 2,000 passengers an hour, they need a way to transport larger capacity than the bus but less than that a suburban railway line would have.

Biography  = Early years = Gatewood was born November 8, 1942 in Elgin, Illinois. From ages one to three Gatewood lived with his father, John Jay Gatewood (a traveing salesman) and his mother, Clarene Hall Gatewood (a housewife) near Dallas, Texas. In 1945 the family moved to Rolla, Missouri, where Gatewood's father found work as a traveling salesman. In 1951, the Gatewood family moved to Springfield, Missouri, where Charles attended J.P Study Jr. High and Parkview High School. = Education = From 1960 to 1964, Gatewood attended the University of Missouri, majoring in Anthropology and taking a minor in art history. In 1964, as he was finishing his first year of graduate work, Gatewood met George W. Gardner, a gifted student photographer. Gatewood credited Gardner's work and a Museum of Modern Art photography book, \\"The Family of Man\\" as influences that helped him choose a career in photography. = European studies = From 1964 to 1966, Gatewood lived and worked in Stockholm, Sweden. He enrolled at the University of Stockholm to study sociology and apprenticed with a group of documentary photographers. In 1965, after exploring Europe, Gatewood returned to Sweden and found work as a darkroom technician for AB Text & Bilder, a Stockholm news agency. At night, Gatewood took advantage of his press pass and the agency's sophisticated equipment to photograph jazz concerts and happenings. On April 29, 1966, Gatewood photographed the press conference and concert of musician Bob Dylan. One photograph, \\"Dylan With Sunglasses and Cigarette,\\" was syndicated and received worldwide publication. It was Gatewood's first sale, his first published picture. \\"Taking the Bob Dylan photo gave me faith I could actually be a professional photographer,\\" said Gatewood. Other celebrity photos taken by Gatewood during this time include pictures of Martin Luther King, Jr., Ornette Coleman, Sonny Rollins, Joan Baez, Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald. = The Manhattan years = In June, 1966, Gatewood returned to the United States, rented an apartment on Manhattan's Lower East Side, and found work as second assistant at Jaffe-Smith photography studio in Greenwich Village. Ten months later, after learning studio photography techniques and advanced darkroom skills, Gatewood quit Jaffee-Smith and began his career as a freelance photographer. Rents were cheap, and the photography market was booming. Gatewood rented part of a photography studio at 8 East 12th Street, and sold photos to textbooks, magazines, poster companies, and other editorial markets. From 1970 to 1974 Gatewood worked as staff photographer for the Manhattan Tribune. He also photographed on assignment for The New York Times, Rolling Stone, Harper's, Business Week, Time and other magazines. In 1972 and 1976, Gatewood was awarded CAPS fellowships by the New York State Arts Council. In 1975, Sidetripping, Gatewood's first photography book, was published, with text by William S. Burroughs. The book was widely praised. A.D. Coleman, writing in The New York Times, said, \\"Gatewood's work is freakish, earthy, blunt, erotic--most of all, terribly and beautifully alive.\\" Gatewood's work during this period included shots of Mardi Gras in New Orleans (12 times), Gay Pride celebrations and Manhattan's downtown music and art scene. The notables he photographed in this time span include Andy Warhol, Allen Ginsberg, Sly Stone, Luis Bu√±uel, Bernardo Bertolucci, Ron Wood, Carlos Santana, Abbie Hoffman, Etta James, Gil Evans and Nelson Rockefeller. = The Woodstock years = From 1978 to 1987, Gatewood lived near Woodstock, New York, and worked in Manhattan and elsewhere. His photos from this period include one of social protests, rock festivals, Mardi Gras in New Orleans, body modification, outlaw bikers, and nature. The celebrities he captured images of include Larry Clark, Annie Sprinkle, Michael O'Donoghue, Ira Cohen and Quentin Crisp. In 1984 the New York State Arts Council awarded Gatewood a grant to publish Wall Street photographs, and in 1985 the book Wall Street was awarded the Leica Medal of Excellence for Outstanding Humanistic Photojournalism. In 1985, a feature film about Gatewood, titled \\"Dances Sacred and Profane\\", premiered at the Antwerp Film Festival and was screened in U.S theaters to critical acclaim.https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DEEDF1E31F930A25755C0A961948260 = San Francisco = From 1987, Gatewood lived and worked in San Francisco, California. From 1998 to 2010, he was a photographer for Skin and Ink magazine. During this period, Gatewood produced over thirty documentary videos about body modification, fetish fashion and other alternative interests. His San Francisco period subjects include the Folsom Street Fair (15 times), Dadafest (4 times) and Burning Man (4 times). Gatewood also photographed a number of nude studies during this period. Gatewood's documentation of alternative culture in San Francisco is unmatched. People he photographed include Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Herb Gold, Charles Henri Ford, Carol Queen, Ron Turner and Ruth Bernard. Gatewood's photo books from this period include A Complete Unknown, Burroughs 23, Badlands, True Blood, The Body and Beyond and Primitives.

It was screened in the Special Presentation section at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot After Moroccan entrepreneur Moulay Hassan (Omar Sharif) abruptly dies of a heart attack members of his family come together for a three-day mourning period over his death. Foremost among the mourners are Aicha (Hiam Abbass), his wife, and his three daughters Miriam (Nadine Labaki), Kenza (Lubna Azabal) and Sofia (Morjana Alaoui). Sofia is someone estranged from her family, having left Morocco to act in Hollywood years before. Furthering the rift between her and her family is the fact that her older sister Leyla committed suicide years before, in part because Moulay was controlling towards her and refused to let her marry Zakaria, the son of their maid, who she was in love with. Despite trying to reconnect with her family Sofia finds herself feuding with them when they discover that she is divorcing her American husband and is critical of her sisters decisions to marry Moroccan men whom their father approved of but whom they do not love. Sofia temporarily leaves her mourning family to spend time with Zakaria but fights with him after he leaves her at a club to go have sex with the mother of his child in the bathroom. Fighting with Zakaria, Sofia learns that her sister Leyla was pregnant when she committed suicide. While going through her father's things Sofia finds a picture of Zakaria with her father and the maid looking like a family. She realizes that Zakaria was her father's biological son making him her half-brother. Zakaria also receives a call from the executor of Moulay's estate and learns that he was Moulay's son, and also his heir. At the reading of the will the other sisters discover the truth including the fact that Aicha knew that Zakaria was Moulay's son. Initially horrified, they decide to forgive their mother after she tells them that she kept silent in order to preserve family unity. Furthermore she encourages Zakaria to accept his inheritance, which is greater than that of the sisters as he is the sole male heir. Reconciled, the entire family gathers together to watch old home movies from when the sisters were little girls. They are interrupted by the arrival of Sofia's husband who left the set of his latest film in order to reunite with her.

The character was created by head writer Ron Carlivati and introduced by executive producer Frank Valentini in the summer of 2012 in what was initially supposed to be a bit role. Gati's Dr. Obrecht is the director of the Swiss clinic where the presumed dead Dr. Robin Scorpio (Kimberly McCullough) is being imprisoned by the infamous Cesar Faison (Anders Hove). Impressed by Gati's portrayal of the character, the producers expanded the role and in early 2013 Obrecht was revealed to be the mother of the scheming Dr. Britt Westbourne (Kelly Thiebaud) fathered by the legendary Faison himself. Obrecht schemes to help Britt win the affections of Robin's husband, Dr. Patrick Drake (Jason Thompson) and later Nikolas Cassadine (Tyler Christopher) by impregnating Britt with Dante (Dominic Zamprogna) and Lulu Falconeri (Emme Rylan)'s embryo. Obrecht also develops a rivalry with Faison's longtime obsession and Robin's mother, Anna Devane (Finola Hughes). In 2014, in addition to becoming chief of staff at General Hospital, Obrecht is revealed to be the biological mother of Detective Nathan West (Ryan Paevey), raised by her estranged sister, Madeline Reeves (Donna Mills). Gati took a break from the role in 2020. She last appeared on 13 April 2020. She returned on 28 September 2020.  Development  = Casting and creation = \\"They needed a German doctor to say a few things and then go\\" Gati remarked to Soaps In Depth of how her character came to be. However, the writers were so impressed that they kept bringing Gati back. Gati said her status with the series \\"was always precarious and still is,\\" despite the role being expanded. The role was only meant to last a few days to \\"take Robin (Kimberly McCullough) from Room A to Room B and talk to Tony Geary [Luke] in the hall to help him avoid seeing Robin and Anna Devane (Finola Hughes).\\" It was actually Tony Geary who sang Gati's praises to the executive producer, Frank Valentini after their scenes. Immediately impressed, Valentini sent head writer Ron Carlivati a piece of her scenes knowing Carlivati would be inspired to write more for her. Valentini chose Gati out of five other actresses that were up for the role. Valentini immediately informed Carlivati of how good she was. Though she was finding success in other recurring gigs, Gati insisted that \\"if GH asks me to sign a contract, I'll say yes. I feel like I'm at home here. I've been in Los Angeles for 15 years, and for the first time, I actually feel like I belong to a family.\\" In October 2013, the role was briefly played by Finola Hughes when Dr. Obrecht tries to pass herself off as Anna Devane. = Characterization = Kathleen Gati said Obrecht is a \\"very focused woman, very educated, very serious.\\" Obrecht is a \\"force to be reckoned with,\\" the actress said. Dr. Obrecht is usually very \\"self- sufficient.\\" Mara Levinsky described the character as a \\"sharp-tongued scene- stealer.\\" Gati saw the potential for her character very early on and described Obrecht as \\"delicious and nasty.\\" As the role continued to expand, \\"the writers gave me so many colors I could bring to the role. She was evil, she was kind, she was painful.\\" Gati rejected the notion that Obrecht could be \\"rational\\" and said \\"She basically is evil\\" However, the actress insisted that Obrecht is a \\"person\\" who has \\"emotions\\" and shows \\"sensitivity\\" and a \\"soft side.\\" She is not just \\"the campy, the broad, the evil, and the dark.\\" Gati insisted Obrecht's \\"most redeeming\\" quality is the humor. Gati explained: \\"If Obrecht didn't get bonked on the head here and there when she made a big mistake, or if they didn't throw in an 'oops' every now and then, viewers wouldn't enjoy the character as much.\\" That humor serves as a \\"relief\\" for viewers. When compared to herself, Gati said Obrecht is \\"dark and terrorizing\\" and characterized her as a \\"powerhouse.\\" While the character has traits that humanize her, she was never given an actual redemption story. Soaps In Depth described Obrecht as \\"strong, smart, powerful, and has a humorous way with words.\\" Maria Ciaccia of About.com described the character as \\"cold and domineering.\\" Of the way her character speaks, Gait said \\"She speaks with a certain style, intelligent and harsh.\\" Obrecht is a \\"German character, but Swiss German, bright and sharp.\\" When it comes to her character's dialogue, Gati explained that she tried to be as \\"verbatim as possible\\" because the character is written \\"stylized, broad and it's very detailed.\\" As for the character's accent, the script is written in English and Gati inserts later. Kathleen Gati said she tries to get her scripts early so she can work in the character's accent. Gati described the accent as not being \\"quite Swiss. It's not quite German. It's something in between. In between where and where is virtually indecipherable. The accent is among the worst ever attempted, by anyone, anywhere. I have developed some kind of accent, sort of a neutral something, because she's very educated so she's obviously spent time in England and Britain.\\" Gati then reviews her work and picks out things she thinks went over well and words or phrases she thinks need to be improved on. = Family and children = In March 2013, Obrecht was revealed to be the mother of the scheming doctor Britt Westbourne (Kelly Thiebaud). Ron Carlivati said that once the writers came up with the idea to connect the characters, it just made sense. Britt had been \\"horrible\\" so the reveal makes Britt more \\"sympathetic.\\" Obrecht resents her daughter because Britt could not help her keep her father. In reference to the dynamic between the two, Gati insisted that Obrecht does love Britt, but she does not always show it.\\" According to Gati, Britt needs her mother because of her strength. There are some moments were Obrecht tries to show affection to Britt as a mother but \\"there's an awkwardness about it\\" Gati said. Gati described Obrecht's feelings for Britt as \\"challenging\\" because even though the feelings exist, those feelings are \\"minimal at best.\\" However, the actress continued \\"There is some warmth. She tries.\\" Gati said the \\"writers open the window a tiny bit - I reach through and then bang, so it's very contrived. There's an attempt, but she's not successful.\\" Obrecht takes steps to bond with her daughter after finding out about her engagement to Nikolas Cassadine (Tyler Christopher) and Gati said \\"She's looked in the mirror and seen the mistakes that she's made.\\" Obrecht comes up with a new plan to benefit Britt and Gati said \\"She would go to great, great lengths to protect the child and to protect Britt, and defend her daughter as much as she can. She's trying to make up for lost time.\\" However, the scheme makes things worse. In 2014, Obrecht is revealed to be the estranged younger sister of the wealthy Madeline Reeves, played by Donna Mills, and the biological mother of Madeline's \\"son,\\" Nathan West (Ryan Paevey). Gati said the jail scenes between Obrecht and Madeline give another layer to why the character is the way she is; she had a \\"sister and the parents from hell.\\" Carlivati explained that \\"Obrecht is feeling a lot of emotions about\\" Nathan whom she for some reason gave up. Despite her feelings, Nathan has trouble trusting Obrecht, not only because her reputation precedes her, but also because of his troubled relationship with Madeline who he believed was his mother. Nathan's initial rejection \\"almost makes you feel sorry for Obrecht,\\" Carlivati said. During the 2014 Nurses Ball episodes, the character of Dr. Obrecht was heavily featured in the musical episodes where she performed a rendition \\"Always on My Mind\\" for her children. Ron Carlivati accredited Anna Cascio, one of the members of the writing team for suggesting that Obrecht sing to her children and the song choice. Carlivati described the performance as a \\"confession to her children that she was a bad mother\\" or \\"An apology\\" Gati said. Because the character of Nathan was just becoming familiar to viewers, the performance creates an immediate \\"relationship between the brother and sister\\" and also displays how uncomfortable they are with Obrecht showing \\"real emotion.\\" It helps them to understand that she does feel some kind of affection for them. Obrecht is thinking, \\"Wow. I made a step. There is progress. It's tiny, but it's huge. It's one small gesture, but it spoke volumes.\\" = Relationships = Kathleen Gati revealed that she first learned of the plans of Obrecht's relationship with the infamous Cesar Faison (Anders Hove) in January 2013 and she was immediately \\"ecstatic.\\" Ron Carlivati revealed that Obrecht's expansion started out as her being a \\"talk-to\\" for Faison when he is masquerading as Duke Lavery (Ian Buchanan) between October and December 2013. In March 2013 after Obrecht's connection to Britt was revealed and fans were left to speculate about her paternity, Regan Cellura said that Obrect's \\"unwavering loyalty\\" Faison was a bit \\"telling\\". Gati said that Obrecht idolizes Faison and looks at him as a \\"god.\\" Of their history, the actress said that \\"she idolized from the time they were very young.\\" From her point of view, Faison has done \\"amazing things. Even if they're dark and cruel and horrible characters, she's fascinated by him.\\" Faison and Obrecht are two people who \\"found each other in their evilness.\\" Even though Faison moves on and falls in love again, Obrecht never gets over him. \\"She's a one- man woman who has been focused on him and hasn't taken her eye off him. Even if she wanted to explore other romantic interests, Gati said \\"[Obrecht] needs him.\\" Faison is Obrecht's \\"Achilles' heel.\\" Gati explained, \\"The only time Obrecht is much is when she sees him or hears his name. She becomes like a puppy. It's like Pavlov's dog.\\" According to Kathleen Gati, it is Obrecht's \\"twisted affection\\" for Faison that allows the audience to embrace her. Fans can understand that she is upset because \\"she's been dumped and disrespected and not cared about and put aside.\\" Not only can viewers relate to her pain, but some can also defend the pain she causes. In reference to Obrecht's admiration for Faison, Gati said \\"Faison is her everything.\\" The actress explained in character that \\"I have admired him, loved him.\\" Faison is \\"her god, her genius.\\" Gati said Faison asking Obrecht to wear the \\"Anna\\" mask to have sex with him is the \\"ultimate rejection\\" and \\"beyond humiliating. Then that awkward moment trying to seduce him, and she is not that good at it, and then trying anyway she can, and being totally rejected.\\" Gati said that the scenes are a \\"turning point\\" for her character and she questioned \\"how much [Obrecht] would take from Faison.\\" The character gets another love interest when the writers reintroduce Thaao Penghlis as Victor Cassadine, with whom Obrecht also shares a past. Gati was immediately open to the idea of a potential romance. The actress confirmed that Victor's arrival definitely awakened some kind of \\"unfamiliar\\" feelings in Obrecht. Before Victor, it is assumed that Faison was the only man to ever catch Obrecht's eye. Gati said Obrecht is not accustomed to getting that kind of attention from a man. \\"Don't treat me kindly, because I don't know what to do with that!\\" the actress stated in character. When it comes to Obrecht's attraction to Victor, Gati said \\"He's kind, he's attractive... and they're mental equals. They both have this acute sense of evil. It turns her on.\\" Following the revelation about Nathan being Obrecht's son, there was immediate speculation about Victor being the father. In July 2014, Carlivati said that there was a lot to \\"dig into\\" when it comes to Obrecht and her relationship with Victor. = Feud with Anna and chief of staff = Obrecht immediately despises Anna Devane (Finola Hughes) because of Faison's obsession and love for her. Gati said that Obrecht's disdain for Anna would be \\"on-going for the rest of her life.\\" It all stems from the pain of having lost Faison's affections to Anna at such a young age. They had a relationship and even created a child together and as far as Obrecht is concerned, Faison was \\"tainted\\" by Anna making Liesl look like \\"chopped liver.\\" Gati explained that the hatred would last because Anna is a constant reminder of what she could not give Faison. Obrecht even goes so far as wear a prosthetic \\"Anna\\" mask in an attempt to trick Faison in being intimate with her. Though Obrecht hates Anna, \\"torturing her with Robin is more appealing than killing her\\" because she is helping Faison. Ron Carlivati revealed that when he first pitched the idea of making Obrecht the chief of staff at General Hospital, executive producer Frank Valentini and the network's executives didn't take him seriously thinking it would be \\"impossible.\\" However, Carlivati was willing to take the risk because it \\"galvanizes the entire hospital against a common enemy\\" in Obrecht. It also gives Obrecht a permanent place within the show. The scribe revealed that he had always imagined the $88 million that Jerry Jacks (Sebastian Roch√©) had extorted from Port Charles the town prior to his disappearance in 2012 had been floating around; Obrecht manages to get her hands on some of that money and uses it to invest in General Hospital. Carlivati likened Obrecht becoming chief of staff to Heather Locklear as Amanda Woodward on Melrose Place buying the complex. \\"You put the most hated person in the position of power over everybody else, and that creates story.\\" Because Obrecht is such a \\"polarizing force\\" at the hospital, Carlivati thought it would be appropriate to have her hijack the opening number at the annual Nurses Ball, a celebrated event in the show's history. It was at the suggestion of one of the writers, Chris Van Etten that Obrecht perform \\"Willkommen\\". Carlivati was nervous about even getting invested in the potential performance because he feared that Valentini and the musical director, Paul Glass might not be able to get the rights to the music.  Storylines  Obrecht first appears as the director of the clinic where Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary) is searching for his friend Anna Devane (Finola Hughes) who has come in search of her presumed dead daughter, Robin (Kimberly McCullough). After the two leave, Obrecht is seen speaking with a man who looks identical to Anna's great love, the late Duke Lavery (Ian Buchanan). It is eventually revealed that Duke is actually Cesar Faison (Anders Hove) in disguise, trying to win Anna's affections. Faison returns to Switzerland to reprimand Obrecht when Robin manages to escape briefly and contact her husband, Patrick Drake (Jason Thompson). In December 2012, after Faison is arrested, she stabs Robin's father, Robert Scorpio (Tristan Rogers) with a dose of a lethal drug leaving him comatose before delivering Robin to Jerry Jacks (Sebastian Roch√©). In March 2013, Obrecht comes to Port Charles where she reunites with her daughter, Britt Westbourne (Kelly Thiebaud) who has been dumped by Patrick in favor of Sabrina Santiago (Teresa Castillo). Thinking it will help her daughter get Patrick back, Obrecht has Britt announce that she is pregnant with Patrick's child at the Nurses Ball and it also revealed that Faison is Britt's father. It is eventually revealed that Patrick is not the child's father because Obrecht faked the paternity test. Obrecht resurfaces several months later to warn Britt that her schemes are about to exposed. In addition to helping her daughter, Obrecht also schemes to get revenge Anna for stealing Faison's affections from her. Her attempt to poison Anna ends with Duke falling into a coma just as he points the finger at Obrecht. Fortunately for Obrecht, she is able to avoid being arrested. Obrecht resurfaces to congratulate Britt on the giving birth to her son, Ben only to learn that Britt has given up on Patrick and revealed the truth about the paternity. Obrecht then kidnaps the child and leaves him with Robin on Cassadine Island. Obrecht also manages to sneak Faison out of prison by disguising herself as Anna and introduces him to their grandson. Devastated by Faison's rejection again after he wants her to wear the Anna mask in order to have sex. Obrecht along with Faison, Robin and Jerry Jacks go to Port Charles where they move in with Britt's boyfriend, Nikolas Cassadine (Tyler Christopher) as they wait for Robin to develop a cure for Jerry's plutonium poisoning. Obrecht and Faison later take Duke hostage in the catacombs. Duke tricks Obrecht into letting him go only for Nikolas, Faison and Anna to show up. Obrecht is finally sent to jail where she tries to blackmail Britt into getting her released by threatening to reveal that Ben is the biological child of Lulu (Emme Rylan) and Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna) conceived from their stolen embryo. Afterwards, she meets Robin's longtime best friend Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) across from her cell where he was later released. With the help for her former flame, Victor Cassadine (Thaao Penghlis), Obrecht secures her freedom and is appointed chief of staff at General Hospital after Sonny was released. During Nikolas and Britt's engagement party, it is revealed that Ben is Dante and Lulu's and Obrecht kidnaps him and forces Elizabeth Webber (Rebecca Herbst) to hide them. Obrecht shoots Elizabeth as Ben is rescued and while in lock-up, Obrehct is reunited with her estranged sister, Madeline Reeves (Donna Mills). When Obrecht sees Madeline's son, Detective Nathan West (Ryan Paevey), she immediately realizes that he is the son she gave to Madeline to raise. Obrecht later works out a deal where she agrees to turn over Dante and Lulu's last viable embryo in exchange for immunity for herself and Britt. Nathan immediately rejects the notion of Obrecht being his mother but she tries to reach out to both of her children at the Nurses Ball. After Nathan is kidnapped during a case, Obrecht accuses Anna of killing Faison and trying to take her son away. Obrecht reaches out to Victor for help but he instead questions if Nathan is his son. Obrecht figures out that Victor has Nathan and tips the PCPD off about Victor's whereabouts. Obrecht confronts Victor and confirms his suspicion that Nathan is his son but the DNA test proves she is lying. Victor is about to kill Obrecht until Anna comes to arrest him and Obrecht shoots him. She meets Valentin Cassadine (James Patrick Stuart) who later becomes her nephew-in-law by marriage to her niece Nina Reeves (Michelle Stafford) and gains Charlotte Cassadine (Scarlett Fernandez) as her great-niece. Obrecht reveals that she needs Nathan to believe the lie because the truth is much worse, that Faison is Nathan's biological father after Obrecht's new friend Janice Lomax (Shari Belafonte) resigned from her position as Mayor of Port Charles leaving the city unprotected. She later visits Nelle Benson (Chloe Lanier) in prison.  Reception  In October 2013, ABC Soaps In Depth ranked the character at #5 in the \\"5 Things We're Loving\\" section and said Gati's \\"Obrecht makes being bad look oh so good!\\" Soap Opera Digest gave General Hospital the \\"Best Villains\\" award for 2013 and Obrecht was among the favorites. The magazine raved that \\"Establishing the perverse cronyism of Faison, Helena, Jerry and Dr. Obrecht was a stroke of creative genius, but each character also shined individually.\\" The magazine praised the character saying, \\"Obrecht continued her scene- stealing rise to villainous power by maneuvering daughter Britt like a chess piece, tossing off cruel one-liners with expert precision and rocking the heck out of that Anna [Devane] mask.\\" Rosemary Rossi said \\"Sure, Obrecht is a villainess. But viewers delight in her wickedness rather than just deplore her machinations.\\" Gati shared the title of Performer of the Week with Anders Hove for their portrayal of Obrecht and Faison during scenes in which Obrecht tried to seduce Faison wearing an Anna mask. Editor Stephanie Sloane described the performances as \\"uniquely but equally mesmerizing.\\" While Hove is definitely known for his legendary style, Sloane raved that Gati \\"has quickly become one of the trustiest weapons in GH's arsenal, via her full-bodied embrace of Obrecht's matter-of-fact cruelty.\\" On-Air On-Soaps said Gati gave the \\"Best Overall Performance By a Supporting Actress.\\" Of Obrecht's familial connections, Maria Ciaccia said \\"[she] is now 'connected' nad here to stay. That's a tribute to the actress because this was probably a short-term role.\\" Ciaccia praised the actress and said \\"there's something about Gati as Dr. Obrecht -- we just love having her around.\\" On-Air On-Soaps praised the actress for her portrayal of Obrecht during scenes in which the character schemed to take out her rival Anna Devane, played by Finola Hughes. Soaps In Depth said \\"what makes Obrecht a fan favorite is the contrast between her evil deeds and the delight she takes in them.\\" Michael Fairman praised Gati and head writer, Ron Carlivati for their creation of \\"one the most fascinating characters in Port Charles.\\"In reference to the character being named chief of staff, Fairman responded \\"How on earth will the GH writing team explain\\" the twist? Connie Passalacqua said \\"I literally screamed\\" at the reveal that Britt and Obrecht were mother and daughter. Passalacqua listed Obrecht as one of her favorite characters in soaps during the summer of 2013. In August 2013, The TV Addict said Gati portrayed Obrecht to \\"delightfully campy perfection.\\" Michael Fairman praised Gati \\"who is able to deliver some pretty outrageous dialog, and wonderful one-liners\\" On-Air On-Soaps was shocked that Gati did not make the pre-nominations list for Daytime Emmy Awards Supporting Actress category. Michael Fairman praised the actress for her opening performance of \\"Willkommen\\" at the 2014 Nurses Ball. Fairman described Gati as \\"one of the biggest and most unique standouts on the canvas of the ABC soap opera!\\" Fans voted Gati's rendition of \\"Willkommen\\" as the best performance at the ball on a Daytime Confidential poll. The blog also listed Obrecht at #15 on the list of \\"15 Soap Opera Moms Who Deserve Nothing For Mother's Day.\\" Luke Kerr of Daytime Confidential likened the character of Liesl Obrecht to Olenna Tyrell (Diana Rigg) on Game of Thrones. While Obrecht's fans don't always come off perfectly, \\"like her Westeros counterpart, she has ensured her family is taken care of with one hood move after another.\\"  References  Category:General Hospital characters Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas Category:Fictional scientists Category:Fictional physicians Category:Television characters introduced in 2012 Category:Fictional Swiss people Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional female doctors Category:Female villains ","title":"Liesl Obrecht"},{"id":"40260288","text":"Owrjak (, also Romanized as ≈™rjak) is a village in Oryad Rural District, in the Central District of Mahneshan County, Zanjan Province, Iran.

A subset of a topological space is called a scattered set if it is a scattered space with the subspace topology.  Examples  * Every discrete space is scattered. * Every ordinal number with the order topology is scattered. Indeed, every nonempty subset A contains a minimum element, and that element is isolated in A. * A space X with the particular point topology, in particular the Sierpinski space, is scattered. This is an example of a scattered space that is not a T1 space. * The closure of a scattered set is not necessarily scattered. For example, in the Euclidean plane \\\\Bbb R^2 take a countably infinite discrete set A in the unit disk, with the points getting denser and denser as one approaches the boundary. For example, take the union of the vertices of a series of n-gons centered at the origin, with radius getting closer and closer to 1. Then the closure of A will contain the whole circle of radius 1, which is dense-in-itself.  Properties  * In a topological space X the closure of a dense-in-itself subset is a perfect set. So X is scattered if and only if it does not contain any nonempty perfect set. * Every subset of a scattered space is scattered. Being scattered is a hereditary property. * Every scattered space X is a T0 space. (Proof: Given two distinct points x, y in X, at least one of them, say x, will be isolated in {x,y}. That means there is neighborhood of x in X that does not contain y.) * In a T0 space the union of two scattered sets is scattered.https://doi.org/10.1515/tmmp-2016-0015, proposition 2.8https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3854864 Note that the T0 assumption is necessary here. For example, if X={a,b} with the indiscrete topology, {a} and {b} are both scattered, but their union, X, is not scattered as it has no isolated point. * Every T1 scattered space is totally disconnected. : (Proof: If C is a nonempty connected subset of X, it contains a point x isolated in C. So the singleton {x} is both open in C (because x is isolated) and closed in C (because of the T1 property). Because C is connected, it must be equal to {x}. This shows that every connected component of X has a single point.) * Every second countable scattered space is countable.https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/376116 * Every topological space X can be written in a unique way as the disjoint union of a perfect set and a scattered set.Willard, problem 30E, p. 219https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3856152 * Every second countable space X can be written in a unique way as the disjoint union of a perfect set and a countable scattered open set. : (Proof: Use the perfect + scattered decomposition and the fact above about second countable scattered spaces, together with the fact that a subset of a second countable space is second countable.) : Furthermore, every closed subset of a second countable X can be written uniquely as the disjoint union of a perfect subset of X and a countable scattered subset of X.https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/742025 This holds in particular in any Polish space, which is the contents of the Cantor‚ÄìBendixson theorem.
