It is a historical drama set in the late 18th century during the Russian domination of Polish Lithuania, and elements of the plot are drawn from the story of the chess-playing automaton known as The Turk.  Plot  In 1776, a young Polish patriot, Boleslas Vorowski, is wounded in an abortive uprising against the Russian forces in Vilnius. A reward for his capture is offered but he is sheltered by Baron von Kempelen, an inventor of lifelike automata, who plans to smuggle Vorowski, a skilful chess-player, to Germany concealed inside a chess-playing automaton called The Turk. Major Nicola√Øeff, a Russian rival of Vorowski, challenges The Turk to a game and is defeated, but he realises that the machine is being secretly operated by Vorowski. He arranges for The Turk to be sent to Moscow to entertain the Empress Catherine II. When The Turk refuses to allow Catherine to cheat, the Empress orders that the automaton is to be executed by firing squad at dawn. During a masked ball, von Kempelen replaces Vorowski inside The Turk, to enable him to escape with his lover Sophie. Nicola√Øeff, who has been sent to search von Kempelen's house, is slain by the inventor's sabre-wielding automata.  Cast  * Pierre Blanchar as Boleslas Vorowski * Charles Dullin as Baron von Kempelen; Wolfgang von Kempelen (1734-1804) was a Hungarian-born engineer who became known for many inventions, most famously his chess-playing machine, The Turk, which he created in 1769 to entertain the Empress Maria Theresa. * √âdith J√©hanne as Sophie Novinska * Camille Bert as Major Nicola√Øeff * Pierre Batcheff as Prince Serge Oblonoff * Marcelle Charles-Dullin as Catherine II, Empress of Russia.  Production  The Chess Player was the second film which Raymond Bernard made for the Soci√©t√© des Films Historiques, although on this occasion its subject matter of the Polish struggle for independence from Russia did not correspond with the company's avowed devotion to French history. Some scenes were filmed on location in Poland with the assistance of the Polish army (notably the Vilno insurrection and the large-scale cavalry charge). For many of the other spectacular locations, 35 sets were created at the studios in Joinville by Robert Mallet- Stevens and Jean Perrier; the most spectacular was the facade and courtyard of the Winter Palace, which covered some 5000 square metres of land beside the studio. Additional special effects were provided by the British film designer W. Percy Day. Filming began on 15 March 1926 and was completed on 31 October, leaving Bernard only two months for its post-production before the premiere in January 1927.Lenny Borger. [Programme notes for the Thames Silents screenings of The Chess Player in London, December 1990. p. 6] An orchestral score was written for the film by Henri Rabaud. The gala premiere at the Marivaux cinema in Paris was a huge success and the film went on to have a first run of three months at that cinema before its general release in the summer of 1927. Audiences were particularly impressed by the spectacular cavalry charge imagined by Sophie as she sings the Polish hymn of independence. The press reception in France was generally enthusiastic .

A restoration of the film was undertaken in the 1980s, led by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill. In the absence of any definitive negative or print, it required the collaboration of several European film archives from which material in several variant copies was collated; sources in an East German archive and the Cin√©math√®que Municipale in Luxembourg provided the most complete material. The finished tinted print received its first screenings in London in December 1990, with Henri Rabaud's original score conducted by Carl Davis.Kevin Brownlow.

It received 2 nominations at the 9th Africa Movie Academy Awards. OC Ukeje also won a Best Of Nollywood Awards for his leading role as Alan Poza. The plot follows Alan Poza (Ukeje), music executive label play boy, who schemes his way into the hearts of several women within and outside the media company he works for, in a bid to lure them into his bed. His various emotional escapades eventually lead him to trouble as one of his 'victims' is unable to handle the heartbreak he has caused her. Plot Alan Poza (OC Ukeje) is a rich, young music label executive who is extremely narcissistic and boasts that he can get any lady he wants eating out of his hands in approximately \\"3 seconds\\". He refers to himself as a 'sharp-shooter' and the 'rave' amongst ladies. Alan has a snazzy job in Scorpio Media, a top media company; and is convinced that he will be promoted to 'Vice-President'. His friend and partner-in-crime; 'Kokori Oshare' (Okey Uzoeshi) works in the same media house and is equally as 'notorious' as Alan. They share tales of their 'playboy' escapades and tend to 'help' each other out with conquering their 'victims'; women who are unaware of their riotous acts. Alan and Kokori inadvertently leave behind a trail of 'angry' women who want to see them punished for their sins. In its bid to further penetrate the entertainment industry, Scorpio Media is split into 'Scorpio Movies' and 'Scorpio \`Records', Kokori is made Vice-President of Scorpio Movies while new joiner; Pride (Beverley Naya) is appointed as the Vice- President of Scorpio Records. Alan is advised that her appointment is due to a wealth of experience within the industry and is made Pride's deputy. He is extremely embarrassed by this unexpected turn of events and vows to lure Pride into his bed and break her heart, so that he can become her boss technically and emotionally. He is particularly angry that the Managing Director of the firm has strung him on for weeks. Kokori tells Alan that the reason he was sidetracked was because he had slept with Bunmi (Belinda Effah), who was also the Managing Directors' (Norbert Young) girlfriend. Alan proceeds to charm Pride but she constantly refutes his efforts having heard that his nickname is 'Corporate Casanova' as well as of his 'vile' reputation with women, but Alan remains persistent. Pride eventually agrees to go on a date with Alan after he signs a 'known' artist and ends up sleeping with him after 'one too many' drinks. She claims that their relationship is 'strictly business' and leaves the next morning without saying a word. Alan remains persistent in his pursuit and Pride finally gives in after making Alan sit through a 'torturous' evening 'daddy-sitting' her senile father and an extremely embarrassing counselling forum for sex addiction. At the counselling session Alan admits to being cheated on by his first love, blaming his current attitude to women on that experience. Pride tells him explicitly that she is a 'dangerous woman when in love' pleading with him not to hurt her. Totally unplanned, Alan notices his secretary; Ina (Kemi Lala Akindoju); and falls in love with her. Ina is your typical 'good girl', extremely simple and caring. Pride finds out Alan is cheating on her when she walks into his office and sees him kissing Ina. She is hurt and enraged. Alan starts to receive threatening messages and Pride remains extremely upset with him. One evening after work Alan, Kokori and Ina have plans to go out. Ina goes into the ladies toilet and does not come out, she has been kidnapped. Stood outside the ladies' toilet waiting for her, Alan receives a message from Pride telling him where Ina is being held. On getting there he finds Bunmi, threatening to kill Ina, knife in hand, she wants to see Alan hurt and decides the best way to achieve this is to kill Ina, the love of his life. It turns out that Bunmi was the one sending Alan threatening messages all along. She was one of his 'victims' and the relationship had ended badly. The police, led by Pride, rescue Alan and Ina and arrest Bunmi. Bunmi had stolen Pride's phone and sent Alan the message luring him to where Ina was being held. Alan promises to change his attitude to women completely after this ordeal. Six months later; the movie ends with Kokori marrying singer, Kiki, who Alan and Pride 'discovered' on their first date and signed up to Scorpio Records. Alan becomes a 'reformed casanova', him and Ina are still together and are looking forward to a fantastic future. He may get married some day.

Before the 2003 Rose Revolution, according to Foreign Policy, Georgia was among the most corrupt nations in all Eurasia. The level of corruption abated dramatically, however, after the revolution. In 2010, Transparency International (TI) said that Georgia was \\"the best corruption-buster in the world.\\" Low-level corruption has been virtually eliminated in recent years. Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 46th place out of 180 countries. In January 2012, the World Bank called Georgia a \\"unique success\\" of the world in fighting corruption. Philippe Le Hou√©rou said that \\"Georgia's experience shows that the vicious cycle of endemic corruption can be broken and, with appropriate and decisive reforms, can be turned into a virtuous cycle.\\" Georgia is \\"the only post-Soviet state in the past decade to have made a breakthrough\\" in addressing corruption, according to Foreign Policy. Council of Europe's Group of States Against Corruption in its fourth evaluation round noted that Georgia has largely succeeded in eradicating petty corruption, however it is also argued that corruption has changed shape in Georgia in recent years. For example, a 'clientelistic system' has emerged where the country's leadership 'allocates resources in order to generate the loyalty and support it needs to stay in power Background As recently as 2003, according to the World Bank, corruption was an everyday part of Georgian life, with citizens reporting bribery as a regular occurrence. That changed with the 2003 Rose Revolution, which ousted President Shevardnadze, and which is widely considered a reaction to the corruption and poor governance under Shevardnadze. After Mikheil Saakashvili won 96% of the vote in the 2004 elections, he instituted drastic anti-corruption reforms. This including firing the entire Ministry of Education staff. Georgia adopted the anti- corruption mechanisms of nations with successful anti-corruption efforts, such as Italy's anti-Mafia efforts, and German police training. As part of the post-revolutionary effort to crack down on corruption, films showing the arrests of senior government officials on corruption charges were broadcast to the public in order to make clear the seriousness of the effort. In 2004, Georgia's corruption perception score improved more dramatically than that of any other country. In that year, 60% of respondents expected corruption levels to decrease during the next three years. In 2005, however, that figure dropped to 38%. The government's \\"zero-tolerance\\" policy has dramatically changed the situation, leaving the country tied with most advanced European nations in all governance indicator. The country has routinely seen impressive results in varying governance indicators. While the Saakashvili government's efforts all but eliminated petty corruption in the public sector, however, particularly in the police department, tax collection administration, customs bureau, public services, and education sectors. some critics dispute the claim that corruption was eliminated, maintaining instead that there was a shift from \\"rampant petty bribery to more clientelistic forms of corruption.\\" Indeed, according to some sources, many forms of corruption have remained common in Georgia. For example, executive power, combined with a weak judiciary and media, make abuse of power at every level of government a possibility and allow top officials to operate with near impunity. Moreover, while Transparency International Georgia's 2011 National Integrity System Assessment credited the post-2004 reforms with making the executive branch and law enforcement stronger and more efficient, as well as with strengthening the fight against petty bribery and certain other types of corruption, TI Georgia noted that some executive agencies were insufficiently accountable and transparent, that news media had not devoted enough resources to investigating corruption, and that the country's 2010 anti-corruption policy lacked a coherent framework based on a thorough analysis of the challenges. TI Georgia also charged the Anti-Corruption Council, created in 2008, with poor monitoring and evaluation of the plan's implementation. The World Bank has described Georgia's underground economy as the world's largest relative to the scale of the country's official economic activity. Government Thanks to strong enforcement, low-level civil-service graft has all but disappeared since Saakashvili became president. To be sure, some government funds, such as the president's funds, continue to operate with insufficient accountability. Bonuses are paid by government agencies on an arbitrary basis. A 2011 report indicated that political leaders have used public resources to maintain their party's rule of the political system. Also, strong patronage networks endure, and it is common for public officials to blend their position with private enterprise. Transparency International has identified the government's influence on regulatory bodies as opening up opportunities for corruption. The National Communications Commission has been charged with selectively enforcing regulations, for example in awarding and denying broadcast licenses, and has not enforced the rule against government bodies with broadcast licences or government bodies that sponsor media entities. Furthermore, the oversight of the public budget is weak, and as of 2011 the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and other government bodies had yet to institute internal auditing. TI Georgia has criticized the Ministry of Internal Affairs for excessive surveillance of private electronic communications and for placing its officers illegally in independent government agencies. The legislature and judiciary, as well as the media and civil society, are weak in comparison to the executive. Transparency and accountability are weaker in local Georgian governments than in the national government. Unsalaried city council members are exempt from integrity rules that apply to national officials. Public procurement There is little corruption in the public procurement sector. Despite a highly transparent system procurement, certain exceptions and loopholes make no-bid state contracts possible. As of 2012, indeed, 45% of state contracts were awarded without a bidding process taking place. Moreover, licenses in certain sectors have been awarded under less than fully competitive and transparent conditions. One such sector is mining. Another is media. For example, when the management rights for a TV broadcasting tower in Tbilisi were sold at auction, the winner of the auction, who had no background in telecommunications, was selected beforehand. Also, firms with ties to a former defense minister were granted exclusive rights to outdoor advertising in the capital and a license to run the national lottery. Also, some state-owned assets have been sold without competitive bidding, sometimes for less than market value. Similarly, in 2011, the Tbilisi City Hall awarded management rights to a public park to a firm owned by a City Council member. Taxation There is relatively little corruption in the taxation system. Only rarely are companies asked to pay bribes or extra payments in connection with taxes. Tax officials are, however, subject to a degree of executive interference. Supporters of opposition parties, for instance, have been known to be harassed by the tax police. Customs Corruption is rare in the customs service. A 2014 report noted that Georgia had reduced the number of customs facilities and simplified the procedures for clearance, so that importing and exporting involve fewer documents and less expense than elsewhere in the region. Bribery Before 2003, virtually any government transaction required some amount of bribe for processing. Nearly all bureaucrats and officials were said to abuse their power for personal gain. In 2013, the percentage of respondents to the Global Corruption Survey who said they had a bribe for public services was only 4%. In 2011, two businessmen from Israel, Ron Fuchs and Ze'ev Frenkiel, were imprisoned for offering a bribe to the Prime Minister, but were pardoned later that year, supposedly for humanitarian reasons. On the same day that the pardon was made public, the Ministry of Justice announced a settlement with their firm, Tramex, that involved a $73 million reduction in an arbitration award against Georgia. The timing was viewed as suspicious, but the government insisted it was purely coincidental. Elections Experts say that the government exerts \\"undue influence\\" on the electorate, with state officials inappropriately using official resources to influence voters. Before the 2012 parliamentary elections, campaign contributions by corporations were made illegal, but this move was viewed not as an anti-corruption measure but as a means of maintaining the ruling party's advantage. Indeed, the new rules were used largely to intimidate the opposition. Also, some contributions during the 2012 election cycle that were nominally made by individuals were, in fact, corporate donations in disguise. In addition, there are indications that campaign donations made by persons representing companies with government contracts were essentially kickbacks. Contribution disclosure rules were later introduced to address this issue, but the State Audit Office seems insufficiently able to willing to do its part to ensure compliance with the new rules. The Economist complained in 2012 about new limits on political contributions that sought to curb the influence of Georgia's richest man and an opponent of the government, Bidzina Ivanishvili. Police Police corruption is not a major problem in Georgia. Corruption among traffic police was a major problem before the Rose Revolution; after Saakashvili became president, 16,000 traffic police officers were fired quickly and unceremoniously. Judiciary According to one respected source, corruption is not a major problem in the judicial sector Transparency International has stated that while bribery is, in fact, rare in the Georgian judiciary, judges are widely viewed by the Georgian people as corrupt. In 2013, for example, 51% of respondents said the judiciary was corrupt or extremely corrupt. The Prosecutor's Office no longer has the strong influence over the judiciary that it enjoyed before 2012. Education After the recession of the early 1990s, professors were earning so little that they required bribes to get by. Usually, they supplemented their income by charging \\"fees\\" for admissions exams, as a result of which applicants to Tbilisi State University could pay up to a $30,000 bribe to ensure admission and get the highest grades. This changed in 2002, when the World Bank instituted a National Assessment and Examinations Center that developed rigorous assessment examinations. Consequently, students who have taken the exams over the last decade, reported Foreign Policy in 2015, owe their success to their thorough education and not any patronage systems. Media The media are one sector in which opportunities for corruption have risen under Saakashvili. His regime has been behind the takeover of leading media by loyal business interests, as a result of which criticism of the authorities has \\"gradually disappeared\\" from TV, along with investigative programs. Business The Business Anti-Corruption Portal has stated that corruption constitutes a low risk for companies looking to do business in Georgia and that it is easier to start a business than in almost any other nation, due to the increased transparency and efficiency in receiving licenses and permits. Indeed, the business environment in Georgia has been greatly improved in recent years owing to the introduction of comparatively low income taxes and more liberal regulation. There are, however, several issues that companies have to deal with, such as the lack of judicial independence, the lack of enforcement of intellectual property rights, and selective enforcement of economic law. There continues to be an overlap between government and business interests. Many persons with close government ties have become very rich, many public officials have acquired sizable fortunes shortly after leaving government service, and some wealthy businessmen who have been elected to parliament have been able to use their position to benefit their firms. In addition, according to a 2013 report, the owners of some companies have been forced, on occasion, to make gifts to the government, or even relinquish ownership of the business. Also, the extensive process of privatizing state assets has been lacking in transparency, and has in many cases been conducted under \\"suspicious circumstances.\\" It is believed that some firms have been awarded government contracts in return for campaign donations to the incumbent party, and have been discouraged for contributing to the opposition. As a result of such practices, the ruling party's campaign coffers have been 10 to 20 times larger than those of all other parties combined. Transparency International has identified three \\"problematic\\" issues connection with doing business in Georgia: \\"the significant shadow economy, preferential treatment in contract awarding, and the lack of transparency in the wave of privatisation.\\" In 2008, 52% of companies told the World Bank that they had been obliged to compete with unregistered companies for government contracts. As of 2013, bribery was still a factor in the awarding of government contracts. Timber industry Because of corruption, the rate of deforestation is very high.  Anti-corruption efforts  Economic reform and anti-corruption were placed at the top political agenda of the Georgian government led by former President Saakashvili. Since 2004, Georgia had made tremendous progress in the clampdown on corruption and reinstatement of good governance. The total dissolution of the corrupt traffic police in 2004 and the establishment of the Anti-Corruption Interagency Council in 2008 were successful examples of the reform. Low-level corruption has been virtually eliminated in recent years. Both the OECD and the World Bank praised Georgia's unique success in combating corruption. The World Bank, for example, attributed Georgia's success at fighting corruption to the following factors: \\"exercising strong political will; establishing credibility early; launching a frontal assault; attracting new staff; limiting the state's role; adopting unconventional methods; coordinating closely; tailoring international experience to local conditions; harnessing technology; using communications strategically.\\" The lesson of Georgia's success at fighting corruption, according to The Economist, is that \\"[l]eadership and political will are all important,\\" as is \\"establishing early credibility.\\" Ending corruption in Georgia was part of an almost-libertarian effort to minimize the size of the state, creating fewer opportunities for graft. The young and largely western- educated new staff of the government receives a high enough salary to dissuade the temptation of corruption. The Interagency Council for Combating Corruption, formed in 2008, consists of members of various government agencies, civil-society groups, and business associations, and is responsible for coordinating, strategizing, and monitoring the fight against corruption. The Ministry of Justice's effectiveness is considered questionable because of limited resources. The Internal Affairs Ministry's Anti-Corruption Department, formed in 2012, is responsible for fighting corruption. The State Audit Office (SAO) is responsible for reviewing public spending, but it lacks resources to audit in sufficient depth and has been too closely tied to the political establishment. In 2012, the SAO did not enforce campaign-finance rules objectively. In fact, the SAO's head and deputy head resigned from the SAO to run as ruling-party candidates for parliament in that year. On the other hand, the current SAO head has no links to the new ruling government. The State Procurement and Competition Agency, which coordinates and monitors public contracts, has also been praised for its transparent approach to public procurement. Since 2013, Georgia has published online all public contracts, with a few exempted for national security reasons or because of specific exceptions, such as that applied to Georgian Railways. Critics of proposed procurement contracts can file appeals online. The improvement of law enforcement since 2004 has had a significant impact on anti-corruption efforts. According to the 2011 National Integrity System Assessment, law- enforcement agencies are among Georgia's strongest institutions, although the assessment also criticized these agencies' low transparency and accountability levels. Georgia's strong civil-society organizations, while underfunded and dependent almost totally on foreign aid, have played a role in encouraging anti-corruption reforms, such as promoting improvements in campaign-finance law, and in monitoring fulfillment of the country's international anti- corruption commitments. TI Georgia has praised the Civil Service Bureau (CSB) for improving the system of asset disclosure.

He never attended an academy. He was part of the Kortenhoef School, a sub-movement of the Hague School and is thus in the tradition of Barbizon School.The Hague School in The Hague and its surroundings is the place of counterflow to neoclassical painting of the Netherlands and also the central place of origin of the Dutch movement of impressionism. It is also the dawn of the second golden age of Dutch painting.Art Historically van Beek of the flow of the 2nd Golden Age of Dutch painting attributed.The first Golden Age of Dutch painting in the 17th century was the time of the 7 republics of the Netherlands. From his choice of motifs, there are also influences of the Amsterdam Impressionism. His work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics.  Life and work  He initially worked with his father as a decorative painter. Subsequently, he attended the School of Arts and Crafts. Then he continued his education, especially in the panel painting. Van Beek was active in various places in northern Holland. At first he was in Katwijk aan Zee until 1907, then he had a studio in Amsterdam. From 1911, he went to Kortenhoef (Wijdemeren), where he remained until 1931. Finally, his wandering ended in Vreeland (Stichtse Vecht), where he worked as a painter until his death in the year 1941 at the age of 66 years. In Kortenhoef, he met Paul Gabri√´l, who had the major influence on his early work.Paul Joseph Constantin Gabri√´l (1828-1903) was one of the main representatives of the Hague School of the 1st generation. He became famous for his landscape paintings, namely scenes from the polder landscape with windmills and the rural idyll. He brought him up to new issues such as the water lily landscapes in the polder areaAt that time the water lily was an important theme in landscape painting, which was gladly taken up by many artists. These also include Constant Artz, Harold Gilmer, Claude Monet, Willem Roelofs, Gertrud Staats and Jan Hillebrand Wijsmuller. and the issue of peat. There he met Evert PietersEvert Pieters (1856-1932) belonged to the 2nd generation of the Hague School. He had turned to the landscape painting and the genre around the daily life of the coast and countryside. The latter is in the tradition of the daily life of the farmers of Jan Steen (1625-1679) and the genre of Pieter Neuhys (1652-1679) of the 17th century and of Albert Neuhuys (1844-1914) of the Hague School of the 1st generation. and Jan Hillebrand Wijsmuller.See also Carole Denninger-Schreuder, page 78.Jan Hillebrand Wijsmuller (1855-1925) also was a member of the Hague School of the 2nd generation. Its genre included almost the entire ≈ìuvre of the movement of Dutch Impressionism. These teachers of the Hague School had a significant influence on his painting style and the perfection of his training.Here the ending system of the Barbizon school reflects once again, where the master and his pupil had a direct contact. In this way the education was to be continued. On his palette, he chose consciously always those mediums which produced a strong surface light. This followed the tradition of the Hague School 2nd generation. Even the winter face has not the usual darkness. Its luminosity is expressed with selected colours quality combined with the wet into wet technique with loose, fluid brushwork. This is a result of the surface of the canvas and the pigments with its binder.Here he leans on the tradition of the range of Jacob van Ruisdael, which in particular finds its precursor in the painting \\"Winter Landscape with Two Windmills\\" ‚Äì (currently in private ownership. In the paintings of the city face he orientated almost towards to Jan Vermeer (1632-1675), like \\"The street of Delft\\" and Gerrit Adriaensz. Berckheyde (1638-1698), like \\"Place at the St. Bravo Church in Haarlem\\". His chosen colors are a sensitive modification of the Hague School 2nd generation. Especially the selected, graded shade of blue as a message of the trapped atmosphere is a characteristic of him. The screen layout is corresponding to the former kind of the old Dutch landscape painting - he rises from bottom left to top right.A good example for these lines from bottom left to top right rising horizon behind the peasant coach house is in the painting \\"Landscape with fountain\\" of Nicolaes Berchem (1620-1683) ‚Äì formerly Gallery Lichtenstein. The horizon of his Pictures moves from the lower third, over the middle to upper third.In the Dutch landscape painting of the 17th century usually the line of the lower third of the image horizon was dominating. The best example is \\"Evening landscape with a hamlet on the Maas Island\\" of Aert van der Neer (1603-1677) ‚Äì it is to be seen in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.  Paintings Return of the fishing boats to Kortenhoef (nearly 1910). His chosen genres ranged from genre landscape painting with scenes of summer landscape, polders and the village face to the city face. In still life, he had primarily adopted the flower as an object.The theme of still life has taken up by the Amsterdam Impressionism Quote page 4. He also chooses the classic theme of the windmill of Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch (1824-1903) and Paul Gabriel (1828-1903)‚Äîboth are in the tradition of Jacob van Ruisdael (1630-1681). Very well known are the landscape paintings from the surrounding of Kortenhoef. He is primarily concerned with inland fishing themes, too.It is in contrast to the paintings of Bomschuiten and the coastal fishermen of Noordwijk aan Zee, Katwijk aan Zee, Scheveningen and Egmond aan Zee. He also immortalized the old quarter of the township and followed the Amsterdam Impressionism, but he didn't follow their black period. In the 1920s, he discovered the bright, light village face. In the color palette, he follows Jan Vermeer and Gerrit Adriaensz. Berckheyde. He belonged to the Kortenhoef School and the Hague School. He has been an amateur photographer, too.See also Carole Denninger-Schreuder, page 78.

The groups musicianship was again noticed as Across The Roots Music Universe, stated; \\"and while the vocals are great on the album, for me, it's the talent of the assembled musicians that make the album really stand-out! As you listen to the album, on some tracks it's the organ and guitar that stand out, and on others Johnny's piano playing takes center stage! But let's not forget the trumpet and drums, at times, and I even think I heard a bass solo on one track!!\\" When asked, in an interview conducted by the Greek writer, Michael Limnios of Greek Blues, \\"What is the philosophy of the MoTones?\\" Altenburgh stated; \\"I love exploring all music because there is good in every music genre. So for the MoTones, we have no set course.

In 2014 the first shops appeared in Lake Hayes Estate within Nerin Square which consisted of a restaurant, bar and general store. A large affordable housing development called Nerin Square is next to McBride Park. It was set up by the Queenstown Lakes Community Housing Trust to help locals into their own homes due to the general affordability of housing in the Queenstown region. Nerin Square was the first major development for the trust, which built 27 homes in the centre of Lake Hayes Estate.  McBride Park  McBride Park is one of the central points of the estate and was named after a family of industrious settlers who first lived on the land.

Traditionally, in Sindh, whenever the snake charmer brought snakes, they were given some Dakhshina (alms) and also milk for the snakes. The folklore of Gogro is set from Kutch and Gujarat. Jhulelal.com Origins In Thatta, near Pir Pitho, there was a kingdom of king Gopichand. The King‚Äôs daughter, Vachhalbai saw a flower flowing in the river. She got the flower with her friend‚Äôs help. A saintly person's soul lived in that flower. As Vachhalbai smelled the flower, the soul entered the stomach. After a few months king came to know about pregnancy of his daughter and was also told about the incident. Jhulelal.com However, the King knew no one would believe the story. He therefore, asked four of his soldiers to take Vachhalbai in a chariot and leave her in a deserted jungle. One ox was bitten by a snake and the soldiers could not proceed with one only ox. Jhulelal.com At this point, Vachhalbai heard a voice ementaing from her stomach: \\"Mother chant this mantra and sprinkle water on the dead ox.\\" Vachhalbai and the soldiers were surprised but they did what they were told, and the ox recovered immediately. The soldiers saluted Vachhaalbai with respect and left her in the deserted place. Over a period of time Vachhalbai gave birth to a child who was called 'Gogro'. When it cried in hunger, all the snakes used to collect there to feed him turn with their poison. This poison gave strength to the child, who with his power dug up a ditch and produced a spring of water. 'Gogro' used to play with snakes and drunk their poison. One day a Rajput king's caravan passed by. The Rajput king was dying of thirst. Gogro gave him water on the condition that he must leave seven boys to live in the jungle. In order to save his life king Chawan left seven boys there. Feeding the seven boys proved to be difficult. Gogro started taking more poison from the snakes. This created a discontent among the snakes and a small snake 'Han Khanu' was determined to kill Gogro; but it had a very little poison. The great snake Python 'Ajgar' gave poison to him. The Cobra said that it is a sin to kill our master. Further, he said that if Han Khanu killed Gogro, he would devour the han Khanu. Since that time the biggest of snakes - Python has no poison and the cobra wherever it sees Han Khanu devours it. Gogro had such a power that if he turned his eyes to the place where a snake bit, the whole poison evaporated. That is why the Han Khanu bit Gogro on his jaw where Gogro could not see the place. While dying Gogro said to his friends \\"When I die you cook me and eat me up.\\" His friends cut him in two pieces, cooked him but did not feel like eating. So they threw the full pot in the river. Some thieves got hold of this pot and ate all the pieces. As they realised soul went to their stomach they also become realised souls and their third eye opened up, through which they could see the future. These thieves were called 'Mamooyoon Fakirs'. Many references are made to this by Dr.Gurbaxani in his poems.

Career Her book Respect, Plurality, and Prejudice combined critical theory with psychoanalysis and psychosocial studies, examining the underlying unconscious forces and structures that make up the phenomena of xenophobia, Antisemitism, Islamophobia, homophobia and sexism. It provides an overview of how social prejudices, and the discrimination and violence that often tend to accompany the latter, come into being. Moreover, It argues that in order to fully understand how a complex phenomenon such as prejudice works, we need to alter our traditional Western philosophical understanding of the subject as a supposedly fully rational, autonomous and individual agent. Auestad argues that we need a more situated and relational understanding of subjectivity and the subject, as prejudice and acts of discrimination always take place in a contextualized setting between subjects whose thoughts and actions influence each other.

It served the village of Rowrah, Cumbria, England. Local lines Rowrah was connected by three separate railway companies: * The Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railway curving southwest to north through the station. * \\"Baird's Line\\" - a branch of the Cleator and Workington Junction Railway arriving at Rowrah from the northwest, and * The Rowrah and Kelton Fell Railway which conveyed minerals from mines in the hills to the southeast. Neither of the latter two ran directly through the station, but all were connected and complex interworking took place. Services The Rowrah and Kelton Fell Railway was a mineral railway pure and simple. It never carried passengers or general goods. Baird's Line was also a mineral line, though workmen's trains ran from Rowrah's \\"other\\" station at Arlecdon, which was on the north western edge of the village. Rowrah Station's owning Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont company was taken over by the LNWR and Furness Railway in 1879 as a Joint Line, whereafter the northern section through the station was usually worked by the LNWR. Passenger traffic northwards consisted of three trains a day in each direction, with an extra on Whitehaven market day and none on Sundays. Those few trains were supplemented southwards to Moor Row and Whitehaven, with a further four starting at Rowrah. From opening, northbound passenger trains terminated at Marron Junction station where passengers changed for destinations beyond. In 1897 Marron Junction station closed, with trains running west through to Workington Main thereafter, a much better arrangement for most passengers. Passengers who would otherwise have changed at Marron Junction to head east to Brigham or beyond simply changed at the first stop after Marron Junction - Camerton. In April 1910 six trains a day ran from to Rowrah via , some continuing to via . No Sunday passenger service ever ran over the line. Goods traffic usually consisted of two daily turns Up and Down. Mineral traffic was the dominant flow, typically six loaded and six empty through to Workington, though this was subject to considerable fluctuation with trade cycles. Stations and signalling along the line north of Rowrah were changed during the Joint regime to conform to LNWR standards.W McGowan Gradon's 1942 Furness Railway study, via cumberlandarchives.co.uk Rundown and closure The Rowrah and Kelton Fell Railway closed in stages between 1920 and 1926. Its tracks were lifted in 1934. The Gilgarron Branch which ran westwards from Ullock Junction closed east of Distington with the ironworks there in the late 1920s. Baird's Line closed on 8 August 1938, with its limestone traffic to Workington being switched to the Rowrah to Marron Junction line. By 1954 this had been re-routed again, this time to run via Moor Row, rendering the line to Marron Junction redundant. This limestone traffic continued until 1978, long outlasting all other services to, from or through Rowrah. The station closed on 13 April 1931 when normal passenger traffic ended along the line, though workmen's trains were reinstated in March 1940, only to be withdrawn a month later. Goods trains continued to call until 1954, but mineral traffic was down to the one limestone flow. An enthusiasts' special called on 5 September 1954. After scant occasional use the line northwards from Rowrah was abandoned in 1960 and subsequently lifted. Such was the goods, ad hoc passenger traffic and special services that Rowrah continued to have a staffed station until 1967, 36 years after passenger services officially ceased. Identified railway staff from Rowrah include:- * George Stoddart was the last station master at Rowrah serving from 1947 to May 1967, leaving into retirement. * Samuel Hastings, railway clerk, married Miss Mary Ann Yates both of Rowrah - 18th MARCH 1882 Afterlife In 2009 Rowrah Station was a private residence.

The episode was written by Rebecca Sonnenshine and Holly Brix and directed by Darren Genet. Plot The episode starts with Katherine (Nina Dobrev) writing on her diary of how great her life is now with everyone thinking that she is Elena (Nina Dobrev) and she thinks of how to win Stefan (Paul Wesley) back. Caroline (Candice Accola), Bonnie (Kat Graham) and \\"Elena\\" are back to college and Caroline wants them to celebrate single life by going to the Bitter Ball. Elena agrees while Bonnie notices a girl next to her spinning her pen in a magic way before Caroline and Elena call her to answer if she is also going to the Ball. Stefan finds Aaron's (Shaun Sipos) body in their home driveway and demands from Damon (Ian Somerhalder) to explain what is going on. Damon says that he just wanted to get rid of the Whitemores for good and then Enzo (Michael Malarkey) shows up saying that it was his idea and asks if Stefan knows where Dr. Wes (Rick Cosnett) might be because he is next on the list. Stefan warns Enzo to stay away from his brother later on, when Enzo tries to bury Aaron's body otherwise he will kill him but Enzo does not seem to listen. Wes is at a laboratory continue with his research even though he does not have his sponsor (Aaron) anymore. He has a new man named Joey chained up that he is turned into a vampire. Joey asks what is going on and Wes informs him about his transformation and that he will train him how to feed on other vampires. A woman, Sloane (Caitlin McHugh) gets into the room and offers Wes a new funding for his research. Sloane tells Wes that Aaron is probably dead and he is next and she gives him some blood to analyze. Stefan calls Elena to tell her about Enzo and Damon but Katherine has no idea who Enzo is. Katherine invites Stefan to the Ball to talk about it there and they hang up. Katherine texts Nadia (Olga Fonda) to ask her find out about Enzo from Matt (Zach Roerig). Nadia is at the bar where Matt works and the moment she gets the text from Katherine, Tyler (Michael Trevino) shows up. Tyler is suspicious about Nadia being there but Matt reassures him that she is fine. The three of them start drinking shots and at the moment Tyler leaves, Nadia compels Matt to tell her about Enzo. Tyler hears the conversation from across the bar. Back at the college, Bonnie tells Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) about the Ball when Damon appears to ask for Bonnie's help about a locator spell. Bonnie reminds him that she is not a witch anymore. Damon and Enzo kidnap Jeremy and threatened to kill him to make her find them a witch who can make the spell. Bonnie agrees to help and she tries to find the girl she saw earlier in class spinning the pen. Stefan arrives at the Ball right after Katherine gets a text from Nadia about who is Enzo. Stefan and Katherine dance while he tells her about that Damon is into some bad stuff but she does not seem surprised or caring. Caroline appears as they dance and takes her away with an excuse, something that makes Katherine wonder if Caroline has feelings about Stefan. She calls Nadia to ask her find out from Matt. Tyler tries to warn Matt that Nadia compels him and he only believes him when he notices that he is not wearing his vervain bracelet anymore. Matt drinks some vervain and when Nadia asks him about Caroline and Stefan, he answers pretending he is compelled. When Nadia leaves, Tyler comes to ask Matt what she asked him but the moment Matt is going to tell him, Nadia comes back and snaps Tyler's neck. Damon and Bonnie come to the dance and run into Stefan and Caroline and Damon tells them that Bonnie is helping him find a witch to find Wes. Caroline tells him to let Bonnie go but Bonnie informs Stefan and Caroline that Enzo holds Jeremy as a hostage and he will kill him if she does not help them. She shows them a photo of Jeremy being tied when Katherine approaches. She pretends to be panicked and rushes away looking upset. She later comes back to beg Stefan help her find Jeremy. Bonnie finds Liv (Penelope Mitchell) asking for her help. Liv acts like she does not know what Bonnie is talking about until Bonnie tells her she knows she is a witch. Liv cannot help because she does not know how to do spells and Bonnie says she will help her by showing her how to do the locator spell. At the middle of the spell, Liv says she cannot do it because she cannot control her power and she does not want to hurt anyone. Enzo calls to ask what is taking so long and tells them that he will kill Jeremy soon. Bonnie convinces Liv to try again while in the meantime, Enzo informs Jeremy that Bonnie is failing and he tries to kill him. Stefan and Katherine rush in where Enzo and Jeremy are and while Stefan fights Enzo, Katherine tries to revive Jeremy. Damon shows up saying that the spell worked and he knows where Wes is. Damon and Enzo head out and Stefan tells Damon not to bother coming back. Later, Stefan admits to Katherine that since the first moment she (Elena) and Damon got together he was waiting and hoping for Damon to screw it up so he can have her back but he stopped waiting when he figured out that he loved that Damon and he did not want to lose him. Katherine tells him that she will not go back to Damon but she will help him save him. Tyler wakes up and asks Matt about Nadia. Matt tries to convince him that it was a misunderstanding but Tyler warns him to stay away from her. When Tyler leaves, Matt gets in the car where Nadia is waiting. She tells Matt that if Tyler follows them, she will kill both. Matt figures out what Nadia and Katherine did and that Katherine is now in Elena's body. Damon and Enzo arrive at the place where Wes is and suddenly they are surrounded by travellers who are chanting and cause them pain and Wes injects Damon with something. Damon and Enzo wake up a little later alone and Damon tells Enzo about Wes' plan to have vampires feed on each other. They hear a noise and they try to find out from where it comes. Damon finds Joey and frees him but when he smells his blood he attacks him and kills him. Enzo tells him to stop but when he does not, he realizes that Damon craving vampire blood is going to be a problem.

It had a good plot with a nice pace and great acting.\\" Carrie Raisler of The A.V. Club gave a B rate to the episode saying: \\"The best thing about these past few episodes since Katherine dumped Damon is that the show finally feels like it is about vampires again. A good vampire show needs one vamp that is evil and just a bit off his or her rocker. For a long time on The Vampire Diaries, Klaus took over this role while Stefan and Damon bothered themselves with winning Elena‚Äôs heart. When Klaus left, that left a big evil vampire hole in the middle of the show. With Damon back to his more diabolical ways‚Äîespecially now that he‚Äôs best buddies with the decidedly menacing Enzo and has been altered to feed on other vampires‚Äîthat hole feels like it might finally be filled again.\\" Ashley Dominique from Geeked Out Nation gave a B rate to the episode. \\"\\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\" moved the Augustine Project plot forward in an interesting way, but only Tyler seems to realize something shady is up with Katherine and Nadia.\\" Shannon Vestal of Buzzsugar gave a good review to the episode saying that Katherine wins this week. Crystal Bell from Wetpaint gave a good review to the episode saying that the show got its mojo back. \\"After getting off to a fast and furious start, TVD started to fall into a lull somewhere between doppelgangers and Travelers. But \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\" put TVD back on track.\\" Leigh Raines from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 3/5 saying that recycling storylines might not be good for the show. \\"[Total Eclipse of the Heart] brought us a lot of what we've already seen before.

The original section was built in 1939, and enlarged in 1943, 1954, 1958, and 1960. After the 1954 addition, the facility consisted of: eight standard classrooms, a principal's office, a clinic and teacher's lounge, library, homemaking department, cafeteria kitchen, combination auditorium-gymnasium, and modern (at the time) rest rooms. Total enrollment for the 1955-1956 session was 228 and the value of the school plant was $200,000. Stafford Training School historical plaqueThe 1954 enlargement cost more than $100,000 and was funded with a State School Construction Funds grant and cash appropriated from the County Board of Supervisors. The 1960 enlargement added the two story cafeteria and home economics department and was built by Stafford school bus drivers. It consists of a one-story, three bay, rectangular main block, flanked by one-story brick wings in the Colonial Revival style.

Geography = Location  Situm is located north-east of Lae, on Singaua Road across the Busu river and over the Bupu River causeway. It is above sea level.  Geology  The area around Situm is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and geologic instability has produced numerous faults, resulting in earthquakes. Situm sits between the larger Indo-Australian Plate and the Pacific Plate on the South Bismarck Plate in the Ramu-Markham Fault Zone where the New Guinea Highlands Deforming Zone and South Bismarck tectonic plates are converging at up to /yr and the seismic hazard is significant. The Ramu-Markham Fault Zone, which follows the northern edge of the Markham Valley, is the active plate boundary between the South Bismarck Plate and terranes within the New Guinea Highlands Deforming Zone. The Ramu-Markham Fault Zone has generated large thrust earthquakes (e.g. the 6 April 1999 MW 6.4, north of Lae, near Hobu, and the 22 November 2007 MW 6.8, north of Lae). Geological evidence suggests that major earthquakes in pre-historic times have occurred in this area, and that there is the potential for another large earthquake to occur anytime within the next 100 years.  Tectonic study  Situm is the location of a geodetic monitoring site which aims to monitor the tectonic motion of Papua New Guinea.Australia National University accessed 7 February 2014 The site ID is 'SITU' and is monitored by the Geodynamics group and the University of California.Australia National University accessed 7 February 2014  History = World War II  Situm is located to the north of the beaches where the Australian 7th Division carried out an amphibious landing in September 1943, as part of plans to capture Lae from the Japanese during the Salamaua‚ÄìLae campaign. During that campaign and the subsequent advance into the Finisterre Range, the locals assisted the Allied troops and after the war, the Australian 7th Division AIF Association helped construct a school at Situm in 1964 as a thank you.7th Infantry Division returns to Situm accessed 7 February 2014  Settlements  Before the establishment of the Situm and Gobari settlements, the area was covered in rainforest and patches of Kunai grass. At the beginning of field research in 1968, Situm consisted of 22 blocks. Among the Situm settlers there were 16 block holders Ploeg, A. 1971, The Situm and Gobari ex-servicemen's settlements, New Guinea Research Bulletin, Issue 39, Volumes 35-40, Australian National University involved in cattle and pig production. Settlers also harvest coconuts from plantations.  Climate  Rainfall in Situm has been recorded at 4000mm per year.  Demographics = Community  In October 2013, a Health Foundation team has conducted a three-day workshop in Situm village, which attracted a total of 63 participants (30 females and 33 males) and allowed women and men to learn about sexual health issues and strengthen their relationship. In July 2013, the Rotary Club of Lae delivered a 5KVA generator to Situm School, and four Tuffa Tanks to the Situm Medical Centre and plumbing hardware to the Situm Health Centre. In 2009, the World Health Organization reported cholera cases in the village of Situm. In Morobe Province settlements of East Taraka, Uniblock, Situm, Nawae Block, Salamander Tais, 12 Mile, Bumayong, Tanam, 6 Mile, 1 Mile, Talair Compound and 2nd street were affected. This is the first confirmed cholera outbreak since the 1960s and PNG officials fear it will further burden their struggling health system. The prevalence of enteric diseases remains high in PNG where access to safe drinking water is limited, particularly in rural areas where an estimated 87% of the population lives.  Economy = Banana chips  Situm women are producing dried banana chips for production as a popular snack.  Taro  In the 1940s Taro Leaf Blight caused by Phytophthora colocasiae was estimated to cause up to 50% loss in production. In 1993, a National Taro breeding program, with the focus on breeding Taro varieties resistant varieties, commenced. By 2000 Situm farmers had given up planting Taro (Colocasia esculenta Schott) because of taro beetles from the genera Papuana and Eucopidocaulus.  Recreational fishing  The Situm Primary School has been described as one of the best fishing or outdoors adventure locations in the regions of Asia/Pacific.  Culture  In 2004, three members from Situm formed a bank called Lungstar of Morobe and have had their debut album recorded and released with the A20 Productions Studio of Barakau.  Situm Primary School  In May 2008, Evangelical Lutheran Church of PNG leader, the late Bishop Doctor Wesley Kigasung, was laid to rest at his Aluki village in Bukawa, Morobe province. What was described as one of the most-moving scenes, Situm primary school, children sang a touching tribute to Dr Kigasung which brought tears to the eyes of those in the motorcade.

Fleming had his schooling interrupted by the Second World War when he was evacuated, and attended a boarding school when the war finished. His father left the family home when Fleming was young and he was raised as a teenager by his mother, who funded his early interest in photography by buying him his first camera. Fleming began by photographing various pieces of artwork and water colourings which he would paint. In 1952, when Fleming was 15, he attended Hornsey Art College but was drafted into National Service in 1955 and served in Northern Ireland. He later took up a position in the Royal Air Force which he soon left. He had a series of menial jobs including a telephone operator, a waiter, a chef and a labourer. Still eager to make it as a photographer, Fleming came into contact with Ronnie Scott and socialised at his Jazz club in London. Fleming started to work for Melody Maker magazine and came to prominence for his photography of Eartha Kitt. During his work as a press photographer, Fleming survived a knife attack and gave up press in 1965 soon after he had photographed the funeral of Winston Churchill for The Sunday Times. Pop art Upon leaving press photography, Fleming met an influential public relations officer in London and was recruited as his personal photographer. The engagement brought Fleming into contact with the Rolling Stones and the Dave Clark Five and he became their personal photographer.

The Vugava is often compared to the Viognier and might be its ancestor. It is a very old variety, believed to be over 2,000 years old and to have been cultivated by the ancient Greek colonists when the island was known as Issa, or introduced by the Roman army. There is even a debate on whether Agatharchides was referring to Vugava when he wrote: \\"On the island of Vis is a wine produced that no other wine equals\\". Vugava requires a lot of attention and needs to be harvested at the right time. Although recognized as a high quality grape variety, it is usually used for blending with other varieties such as Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, or Sauvignon Blanc. This is because in its traditional form, Vugava wine has a very high sugar content and overripe aromas. Vugava wines can best be described as having sweet and fruity flavors which may be lacking in terms of acidity levels. Wines produced from Vugava grapes are best paired with savory foods rich in flavor, such as fish and poultry dishes.

Reflecting a feminist perspective, her works have often explored gender roles, sexuality, and political concerns. She has stated that her work is primarily about \\"identity and play\\". Keane studied at Hammersmith College of Art and Sir John Cass School of Art (1967‚Äì70) and received an MA in Independent Film and Video from London College of Printing (1995‚Äì96). She was a founder member of the non-profit women‚Äôs film distribution organization Circles - Women in Distribution. Keane also curated and programmed exhibitions and screenings including The New Pluralism exhibition at the Tate Gallery (with Michael O'Pray), 1985. She has been an important influence on successive generations of artists in the UK as a teacher at Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design, London, where she was Lecturer in Film & Video since 1982 and Research Fellow from 2003 to 2012. According to Malcolm Le Grice, \\"During the 1970s and ‚Äô80s, the teaching of women artists ‚Äì including Tina Keane, Anna Thew, Anne Tallentire, Joanna Greenhill and Pam Skelton ‚Äìwas one of Saint Martins‚Äô major contributions to art education. Their influence helped create a lasting shift in the gender profile in British art, and Saint Martins in general maintained a committed concern for gender, ethnicity and sexual politics throughout the Thatcher years.‚Äù Notable students who were mentored by Keane include Sandra Lahire, Sarah Turner and Isaac Julien. Her 1978 multimedia work, She, presented at the Hayward Gallery, London, in 1978 was an early example of performance that incorporated live video and slide projections. Transparencies of neon signs, poetry and images of shop windows featuring mannequins were projected on a wall before which Keane performed, while video of the performance played on monitors surmounted with neon texts. Keane has said that the work brought into play \\"the actual and the recorded, the shop dummy, and the person, the illusion and the reality\\" Transposition, first presented at the Museum of Modern Art, Vienna, in 1992, used the body as a screen with video projected onto the naked backs of men as they glide sideways standing on a travelator. Keane subsequently re-edited the piece into a double screen video installation for the inaugural Tanks programme at Tate Modern, London, in 2012. Details of her work can be found on the website of England & Co London, and Lux, London. In 2015, Keane was one of the recipients of the 21st annual Paul Hamlyn Foundation Awards for Artists, the largest individual awards made to visual artists and composers in the UK. Her pioneering, poetic film, 'Faded Wallpaper', was acquired by Tate in 2018.

It follows the story of Ine Onoda, the eldest daughter of a poor family of farmers, who raises a colt from birth and comes to love the horse dearly. When the horse is grown, the government orders it auctioned and sold to the army. Ine struggles to prevent the sale. Overview The film is a tale about a young girl and the colt she raises from its birth. It is also about the struggle of farmers existing on the edge of poverty. Akira Kurosawa is credited as the film's production coordinator, which is equivalent to first assistant director. It is the last film Kurosawa was to work on as an assistant before starting his own directing career. The film took three years to plan and a year to film. Kajiro Yamamoto had to commute to the far mountainous location but had to turn his attention to his money-making comedies in Tokyo and so he left production in the hands of his assistant, Kurosawa.  Cast  * Hideko Takamine as Ine * Kamatari Fujiwara as Jinjiro Onoda, Ine's father * Chieko Takehisa as Saku Onoda, Ine's mother Plot A young girl named Ine Onoda from a poor village family wants nothing more than to own a horse. Her family soon takes in a pregnant mare which they have signed on to care for over the winter. Financial troubles push the family towards the edge of ruin and neither they nor the horse is eating much. The horse becomes very ill and the vet determines only grass will save it. Ine walks many miles through the snow to a hot spring where grass grows year-round and saves the horse's life. That spring gives birth to a colt and it looks as if Ine will finally have her horse. But when the colt is grown, the government orders it auctioned and sold to the army, as unpaid bills force the family to sell the colt. Ine takes a job in a mill to save money to buy her horseback. On the day of the auction, she is outbid and cries as the horse have led away for the last time.

Wooded meadows (also named wood-meadows, park meadows, etc.) are ecosystems in temperate forest regions. They are sparse natural stands with a regularly mown herbaceous layer. While frequent throughout Europe during the Medieval period and before, wooded meadows have largely disappeared. Wooded meadows originated from the practices of hunter- gatherer communities. They were important in terms of social organization around a natural resource and determined much of the community's interactions with the natural world. In the early 20th century, wooded meadows were used for fruit cultivation in Sweden, however their prevalence has decreased substantially due to changes in land management and a movement toward more intensive types of agroecosystems. The more typical, calcicolous wooded meadows are common around the Baltic Sea. Wooded meadows have high species richness.

Biography Gossweiler studied horticulture in Zurich, Stuttgart and Dresden, later spending four years in London at the Royal College of Science in South Kensington, and 1897-98 at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. He was inspired by William Turner Thiselton-Dyer while at Kew, and went on to work for the government of Angola in the country's botanical garden in Luanda, where he remained until his death in 1952. Arriving in Angola, Gossweiler found the garden far from complete, and started collecting in the coastal area around Luanda and the Malanje Plateau. In 1905 he studied the indigenous plant sources of rubber of the Ganguela and Bi√© Plateau regions and collected many novel plants along the Okavango River. Phyllanthus cocumbiensis, Jean F. Brunel.

Gossweiler 13937 (BD) The 'Cazengo Colonial Garden', the botanical garden of which Gossweiler would be director, was finally ready by 1907. Located on the site of an abandoned plantation, Gossweiler stocked it with indigenous species and plants from Sri Lanka, Goa, Malaysia and Tropical America. His collection of pressed specimens steadily grew. In 1915/16 he worked in Subliali, Pango Munga, the rainforest region of Mayombe, and near the source of the Zanza River, where he was accompanied by his wife Martha. Following World War I Gossweiler worked for the 'Fomento Geral de Angola' from 1919-1926, during which time he made substantial collections along the southern bank of the Congo River, in the Dembos region and at Qui√ßama. In 1927 Gossweiler rejoined the government service and worked at starting an experimental cotton station in Catete, travelling to Amboim in 1932 to investigate coffee plant diseases. His collections grew with plants from the mist forest south of Cazengo. He then spent some time in Portugal at the University of Coimbra and the Colonial Garden in Lisbon, working on his collections. Gossweiler embarked on two more collecting expeditions in Angola. In 1937-8 he joined a pair of Portuguese botanists, Luis Carrisso and F.A. Mendon√ßa of Coimbra University, and Arthur Wallis Exell of the British Museum, on an extensive expedition covering some 13,000 km. On this expedition Carrisso suffered a fatal heart attack. Despite his death, work carried on, the results adding considerably to the 'Conspectus Florae Angolensis' of which the first volume, consisting of 55 parts, was published between 1937 and 1951. The other expedition was in 1947 when he collected in the forests of Dundo in the far north-east of Angola. Gossweiler's collections amounted to some 14,000 specimens, and are housed at some of the world's important herbaria. \\"J.

He was also an officer in charge of military expeditions in Nubia.  Career  His real name was Pepinakht (ppjj-n·∏´t - \\"[King] Pepi is strong\\"). As officer, he led at least three expeditions. All of these are registered on the fa√ßade of his tomb at Qubbet el-Hawa (near Aswan), after a long list of his titles. In the first expedition, Pepinakht led a surprise attack in the lands of Wawat and Irthet, slaying many warriors and taking many prisoners to the court of the pharaoh. Then, he was sent back to the same places (second expedition) where he captured some chieftains, and also brought back a booty. For his third expedition, Pepinakht was instructed to bring back the corpse of Enenkhet; he was an expedition leader in charge to build a ship to reach the Land of Punt, but he was attacked and killed along with his escort by the \\"sand dwellers\\". Pepinakht's autobiography abruptly ends while he was attacking the \\"sand dwellers\\". However, it's very likely that he was able to accomplish even this mission.¬ß¬ß 355-360 His capabilities and charisma earned him the nickname Heqaib (·∏•q3-·ªâb - \\"He who controls his heart\\") and then, after his death, a quick apotheosis. This fact may be representative of the great power achieved by local authorities in this period, which is a prelude to the forthcoming collapse of the Egyptian state. His son, named Sebni, apparently succeeded him in his charges. In a room in an official building on Elephantine were found several wooden boxes with names of local officials. One box bears the name of Heqaib.Andreas Dorm: Elephantine XXXI, Kisten und Schreine im Festzug, Hinweise auf postume Kulte f√ºr hohe Beamte aus einem Depot von Kult- und anderen Gegenst√§nden des ausgehenden 3. Jahrtauseends v. Chr. (Arch√§ologische Ver√∂ffentlichungen 117), Wiesbaden 2015, , p. 166-175 These boxes were most likely used in rituals around the funerary cult of the people mentioned on them.  Legacy  Shrines dating to the reign of Senusret I in the sanctuary of Heqaib Shortly after Heqaib's death and divinization, a great number of people started to worship this \\"local saint\\" initially in front of his tomb at Qubbet el-Hawa, and later in a purpose-built sanctuary. From the various documents left by those devotees it is known that many of them were named \\"Heqaib\\" in his honour, and even some pharaohs are known to having left dedications in the sanctuary: among the royal statues found here can be mentioned those of Mentuhotep I (although posthumous), Intef II, Senusret III, Sekhemkare Amenemhat V, Neferhotep I, and Sekhemre-Wadjkhaw Sobekemsaf I, while it is known that Intef III ordered a restoration of the sanctuary during the early 11th Dynasty. Heqaib's distant successors during the Middle Kingdom such as Sarenput I, Sarenput II and Heqaib III, expanded the sanctuary by building shrines dedicated to him and to themselves. However, with the advent of the troubled Second Intermediate Period the sanctuary was progressively abandoned and filled with debris, until its rediscovery by Edouard Ghazouli in 1932 and the subsequent excavations by himself and Labib Habachi.

He was a member of the Italian Communist Party and a leading figure in the city government of Reggio Emilia in northern Italy. In this position he promoted links between Reggio Emilia and southern African countries, in particular anti-colonial and anti-apartheid movements. For this work he was posthumously given the Order of the Companions of O. R. Tambo award by the South African presidency.  Early life  He got a diploma as a factory designer; then he began working for the municipality of Reggio Emilia. From 14 June 1944, he took part in the Italian Resistance against Fascism and Nazism; in the same period he joined the Partito Comunista Italiano (PCI). At the end of the Second World War, he began working in the Officine Reggiane factory and, due to his organizational and managerial qualities, he was appointed Deputy Secretary of PCI Section Santa Croce ‚ÄúReggiane-Officine Meccaniche Italiane‚Äù and member of the trade union inside the factory. He led the struggle against the shutdown of the factory but this caused him some periods of detention. Nevertheless, he continued defense of workers‚Äô rights. In fact, along those years he was news editor of the magazine ‚ÄúLa voce operaia‚Äù, an insert of magazine ‚ÄúLa Verit√†‚Äù.  Political activities = The period of PCI  After the shutdown of Officine Reggiane, Soncini went to Rome, where he attended the Istituto di Studi Comunisti (better known as Scuola delle Frattocchie) and passed a test to become journalist. This allowed him to work in the Press and Propaganda Section of the Party. In the late Fifties, he went to the USSR to attend a course about economic and political theories, while Nikita Khrushchev was leading the country. Here Soncini learned Russian language and got in touch with many students, some of them from Asian and African countries. After the Russian experience, by 1960, Giuseppe Soncini managed the \\"Ufficio Studi Provinciale\\" of PCI of Reggio Emilia: during the first half of Sixties, he published some reports and articles on economic, working and social conditions of Reggio Emilia district.  The roles of Chairman of Reggio Emilia‚Äôs Hospital and of Deputy Mayor  In 1964, he served as a city councillor of Scandiano‚Äôs municipality; then in 1967, he served as board member of Hospital Santa Maria Nuova of Reggio Emilia. When the hospital became Ente Ospedaliero Provinciale, Giuseppe Soncini was appointed as Chairman. In 1970, Soncini became Chairman of Emilia Romagna‚Äôs Associazione Regionale Ospedali (AROER): in this period he promoted the important transition from a mutualistic healthcare system to a universal one. Between 1972 and 1977, he was also FIARO‚Äôs vice chairman: during the first two years, he was involved in negotiations for the first National Labour Agreement (ANUL in Italian), that included rules on private practice and on full-time medical practitioners. In 1975, he left as a Chairman and was elected in the Council of Reggio Emilia municipality; then he was appointed Deputy Mayor on Human Resources, Statistics, Planning, Press and Public Relations Departments and kept this commitment also in 1976 whenUgo Benassi became Mayor. The same mayor entrusted him as Deputy Mayor on International Relationships in 1977, and, in 1980 as Deputy Mayor on Finance Department. His presence in the city council was confirmed both in 1980 and 1985, but he decided to leave in 1986. He was politically active until 1990 when he became provincial Secretary of Local Autonomies League.  International relationships  Soncini had an important role in leading Reggio Emilia into a network of international relationships, in particular with southern African countries. =Mozambique= While Soncini was Chairman of AROER, after a visit of a FRELIMO delegation, he proposed a twinning agreement between Reggio Emilia‚Äôs Hospital and the Hospital Central of Cabo Delgado to help liberated zones of Mozambique. In 1970, a pact ratified this twinning agreement and a Committee for Medical aid to Mozambican people was established and Soncini was appointed Chairman. The aid project was developed with physician Silvio Pampiglione and FRELIMO's Direc√ßao de Saude (health care management): it was decided to send medicines, health facilities and Italian practitioners in order to assist injured people and to train local healthcare assistants. In 1972 Soncini visited Tanzania and liberated zones of Mozambique. On that occasion Franco Cigarini filmed a documentary. Soncini returned to Mozambique in 1975 to take part to celebrations of independence from Portugal and to sign a twinning agreement between Reggio Emilia and the city of Pemba, capital of Cabo Delgado, in order to improve technical and institutional collaboration and to reinforce the collaboration and friendship with Mozambican leaders such as Samora Machel, Joaquim Chissano and Marcelino dos Santos. In 1977 the ‚ÄúComitato Unitario per l‚Äôamicizia, la cooperazione e la solidariet√† con i popoli‚Äù was established. =South Africa= In the same year, on 26 June, the \\"Pact of Solidarity between Reggio Emilia and the African National Congress\\" was approved and signed by the mayor Ugo Benassi and Oliver Tambo. The following year, which UN proclaimed ‚ÄúInternational Year against Apartheid‚Äù, the publication of Italian version of ‚ÄúSechaba‚Äù, the official magazine of ANC, started. Soncini was managing editor of it until 1984 when the last issue was published. Sechaba helped to raise awareness of the international struggle against apartheid in Italy. In 1978, Giuseppe Soncini organized in Reggio Emilia the ‚ÄúNational Conference of solidarity for independence and the sovereignty of Southern Africa Peoples against colonialism, racism and apartheid‚Äù, with the participation of delegates from ANC, Sof SWAPO, of Zanu-Zapu, of Mozambique and of other Southern African countries, as well as Italian leaders. On that occasion it was decided to organize a solidarity ship for southern Africa. In April 1979 the National Committee was established, with Soncini as Coordinator, with the purpose to realize initiatives and campaigns to help anti-colonialist movements in Africa. National and International institutions referred to this Committee during those years. The Committee organized both solidarity ships Amanda (in 1980 from Genoa) and Rea Silvia (in 1984 from Livorno), bound for Namibia and South Africa respectively, with aid and facilities. During the Eighties Giuseppe Soncini continued his activity of political and social commitment for African populations. He also promoted the conferring of honorary citizenship of Rome on Nelson Mandela in 1983. In 1987, Soncini was invited by Oliver Tambo, ANC‚Äôs Chairman, to participate at the Arusha International Conference in Tanzania, an important event dealing with democratic transition in South Africa.  The last years  In the last years of his life Soncini, with his wife Bruna Ganapini, organized his personal archive, bearing witness to his role in Reggio Emilia‚Äôs community and his international solidarity work. Giuseppe Soncini died in Parma on 4 April 1991, after a heart surgery operation. Marcelino dos Santos delivered the funeral speech and Benny Nato, as delegate of ANC in Italy, took part in the ceremony.  Awards  In April 2013, Giuseppe Soncini posthumously received the Order of the Companions of O. R. Tambo bronze award, an honour conferred by South Africa to people from other countries people who have been distinguished in the fight against apartheid and solidarity with liberation movements in Southern Africa. The award was delivered to his widow, Bruna Ganapini.

Welch, Proprietor in Chicago. 1899, p. 304  Biography  Benjamin Hafner, who departed this life in the spring of 1899, was at that time the oldest engineer - in point of service - in the United States. \\"Uncle Ben,\\" as he was affectionately and familiarly known on the Erie, was born in Baden, Germany, on March 24, 1821, and came to the United States with his parents in 1832. His father was Valentine Hafner, one of Napoleon's soldiers, serving as a first lieutenant, and was in the march to Moscow. Mr. Hafner began railroading as a fireman in 1839, and in 1840 commenced running as engineer on the old slab-rail road between Baltimore and Cumberland, Maryland. He came to the Erie in 1848, and was one of the pioneer engineers running between Piermont and Port Jervis. Later he ran on the Illinois Central, and in 1857 made a business trip to Europe. On his return he re-entered the employ of the Erie and continued in active service until March, 1892, when he quit running, and was given the position of depot master at Port Jervis, in which capacity he acted until his death. He was married February 14, 1858, to Miss Mary Catherine Goetz of Baltimore, and eleven children were born to them, five of whom are living. Mr. Hafner was an honored member of the B. of L. E., and stood high in the esteem of the Erie's officials, while every railroad man on the two divisions had a tender regard for the aged engineer, who was one of the best in his day.  Work = Railroad engineer  Erie Locomotive, type of 1846 Ben Hafner was an active locomotive engineer for fifty years, who completed his semi centennial as active engineer on August 17, 1890.Locomotive Engineers Journal. Vol. 25 (1891). p. 49 In this period he wrecked several locomotives, and was himself buried under the locomotive five times.Henry B. Comstock (1974) The iron horse. p. 132 Hafner was a man of romance and of glamor,Edward Hungerford (1946) Men of Erie: A Story of Human Effort. p. 102 and known among railroad men in the country as the \\"Flying Dutchman. He came as engineers on the Erie in 1848 while there was still no railroad beyond Port Jervis. Before he had served nine years on the Baltimore and Ohio. His first locomotive on the Erie was the \\"Susquehanna,\\" a Rogers engine.Edward Harold Mott Between the Ocean and the Lakes: The Story of Erie. Collins, 1899. p. 394-95 There were then less than 200 men on the pay-roll of the Company, and a majority of them were freight handlers at Piermont. Ben Hafner left the Erie in 1854, and ran on the Illinois Central Railroad, but returned to the Erie in 1858. He has been buried under his locomotive five times so that it took hours to dig him out, and he never got a scratch. The Locomotive Engineers Journal (1875)Locomotive Engineers Journal. Vol. 9. (1875) p. 193 published the following story about Hafner: :In the years 1843 and 1844 Mr. Hafner was running an engine from the Relay House to Harper's Ferry, and ran the trains that carried President Polk's message between those points, there being no telegraph in those days. :In the year 1845 he ran an engine from Washington to Baltimore, and witnessed the laying of the first telegraph wire. The wire was first put in the ground, in a trench about two feet in depth, but this plan did not work, as the wire was not properly insulated. The plan was then adopted of placing the wire on upright poles, (of about one-half the height of those now in use) which proved a business. He remembers well the excitement incident to the successful transmission of messages from Washington to Baltimore. :During his service of thirty-five years as engineer, one passenger only has been killed on his train. He ran one engine on this road thirteen years, and another six years, and has run miles enough to travel around the world over forty times... Once, at Ramsey's, the train running at fifty miles an hour, he collided with a coal car. The train was behind time, and he had already made up forty minutes between Port Jervis and that place - a run of about fifty-five miles. His engine turned upside down, and some of the cars were wrecked. Mrs. James Gordon Bennett was a passenger on the train. A brakeman was badly hurt. Mrs. Bennett took up a collection for him among the passengers, contributing liberally herself.  The 1854 strike at Erie  First code of the Erie Train Regulations from 1849 issued by James P. Kirkwood, which McCallum updated in 1854. In a way Hafner triggered the 1854 strike at the Erie Railroad. It all started early in 1854, when Daniel McCallum then superintendent of the Susquehanna division, had drafted a renewed code of rules regulating the running of trains, which he submitted to the Directors of the Company. They were pleased with it, and officially adopted it as supplementary to the existing rules. Charles Minot was then the general superintendent. The McCallum rules were adopted March 6, 1854, and Minot was directed to put them in force. He did not approve of some of them. He refused to promulgate the new code, and resigned.Mott (1899). p 431-2 McCallum took charge as general superintendent May 1, 1854, and his new rules were at once put in force. Trouble was not long in following. The engineers objected to the new order of things, particularly to Rule 6 of the McCallum code, which declared that every engineer would be held responsible for running off a switch at a station where he stopped, whether he should run off before or after receiving a signal to go forward from a switchman or any other person. The engineer, under this rule, was expected to see for himself whether the switch was right or not, and take no person's authority for the same at stations where trains stopped. The engineer, however, had a right to run past stations where he did not stop at a rate he was willing to hazard on his own account, the Company reserving the right to decide whether such running was reckless or not. \\" The road must be run safe first and fast afterward,\\" the management declared. The engineers also protested against the alleged \\" posting rule \\" of the Company, under which notices of dismissal of engineers was at once posted with other railroad companies to the injury of the men. An abrogation of the distasteful rules was requested, June 15, by a committee, consisting of John Donohue, William Schrier, and John C. Meginnes. Superintendent McCallum's explanation and reply not being satisfactory, the engineers struck on June 17 - the first strike in the history of the railroad. This strike on the Erie was settled after ten days' paralysis of the business of the railroad, and a loss of many thousands of dollars to the Company. The engineer over whose case the strike resulted was Benjamin Hafner of the Eastern Division. On the evening of June 10 ran off a switch at Turner's. He was dismissed. After he was dismissed Hafner was sent for by Superintendent McCallum to talk about the incident. Hafner refused to go unless he was reinstated first. McCallum declined to reinstate him without a consultation. The matter was taken up by all the leading engineers on the Delaware and Eastern divisions, with the above result.  The \\"Flying Dutchman\\"  Erie Railroad near Port Jervis, around 1860-75. In 1869, while Jay Gould was President of the Erie, he ordered a locomotive made at the Brooks Locomotive Works at Dunkirk, which he named the George G. Barnard, after the famous Judge of that name. It was the handsomest locomotive ever made up to that time. It was decorated by paintings in oil, on every spot where one could be placed, by the late Jasper F. Crapsey, the artist. There were fourteen coats of varnish on the boiler. Gould selected Ben Hafner to be the engineer of the locomotive. The first trip Jay Gould ever took behind this locomotive with Ben at the throttle he was in a special car, bound for Susquehanna, 104 miles from Port Jem's. Gould told Hafner to go pretty fast. He went so fast that before they had gone many miles over the crooked Delaware Division Gould sent his colored porter ahead to tell Ben to go slower, much to the disgust of Ben. Ben Hafner got the name of the \\"Flying Dutchman\\" in this way: One day in the summer of 1871 No. 8 was late when he took that train at Port Jervis. He had orders to make the run to Jersey City in as short a time as he could. The distance was eighty-nine miles. Hafner made the run in just two hours, including seven stops, one of which was fourteen minutes at Turner's for supper. The passengers were badly frightened at the speed of the train. When the train reached Jersey, one of the passengers passed Ben as he was leaning out of his cab, and yelled at him: : \\"Say, I'd rather sail in the 'Flying Dutchman' than ride after you!\\" From that day to this Ben Hafner has been the \\"Flying Dutchman\\" to all railroad men. In 1893 Hafner retired as an engineer after more than half a century on a locomotive, and since then has been depot master at Port Jervis. He was hale and hearty at seventy-six.

He was adviser to Japan's most powerful ruler of the day, the regent of the sh≈çgun (Shikken) H≈çj≈ç Tokimune (as opposed to an Imperial Regent). He founded the Zen temple Engaku-ji in Kamakura, one of Japan's five most important Zen temples. Early Life and Priesthood Mugaku Sogen was born in 1226 in Southern Song (during the Song dynasty; 1127‚Äì1279) and became a priest at age 11. He entered the priesthood at Ching-tz'u-ssu temple when he was just 13 years old, and soon afterward, in 1239, he visited Wu-chun Shih-fan, under whom he studied the Zen teachings. In order to further his studies of Zen, he met with many different teachers. In 1279, he was invited to spread Zen in Japan by Hojo Tokimune, the eighth regent of the Kakamura Shogunate. Once in Japan, he lived at Kench≈ç-ji temple in Kamakura with Tokimune‚Äôs support. In 1282, when H≈çj≈ç Tokimune built Engaku-ji temple in Kamakura, he invited Sogen to be the founding priest. Two years later, Sogen returned to Kench≈ç-ji temple where he died. He exerted great spiritual influence on the leaders and warriors of Kamakura. Yuan Attack In 1275, Yuan soldiers attacked the temple where Sogen stayed. As the attack progressed, the priests present at the temple fled to safety. Sogen, however, chose to stay behind. According to legend, Sogen sat quietly on the floor in front of the temples main Buddha statue. As one of the Yuan soldiers unsheathed his sword to kill Sogen, Sogen recited a Buddhist precept. \\"I did a comprehensive study to seek the real universe, and finally got the answer. That is to say, all is vanity. People are vanity, and even Buddha‚Äôs teachings are vanity. Now, I am spiritually awakened, and so, even if you want to kill me with your huge sword, I don‚Äôt mind. I already know that I am vanity. This means when you swing your sword, you will just cut through a spring wind.\\" The soldier could not bring himself to kill Sogen, and expressed his respect for him, then turned and left Sogen in peace. As advisor to H≈çj≈ç Tokimune Faced with the strong possibility of war with the invasion on the Yuan dynasty, H≈çj≈ç Tokimune seized rule as the main decision maker of the then ruling Kakamura shogunate. He became responsible for leading the resistance to the Mongol invaders. He built an army with the support of other samurai, regulated internal conditions under his military control, and formed stone bulwarks to keep out the enemy. Despite the painstaking preparations Tokimune had in place, he found himself mentally and spiritually unaligned. At that time, he was already under the spiritual guidance of Mugaku Sogen. Tokimune asked Mugaku Sogen, his Zen master also known as Bukko, for advice. Bukko replied he had to sit in meditation to find the source of his cowardice in himself. When Tokimune returned from meditation, Bukko said to him: \\"Finally there is the greatest event of my life.\\" and asked, \\"How do you plan to face it?\\" Tokimune shouted \\"Katsu!\\" (\\"Victory!\\") as if he wanted to scare all the enemies in front of him. Mugaku responded with satisfaction: \\"It is true that the son of a lion roars as a lion!\\" Later before the second Mongol invasion Tokimune invited him to Kencho-ji Temple from across the sea in 1279, and then often visited him at Kencho-ji. One day during their ongoing conversations, Mugaku Shogen took up his pen and wrote one word for Tokimune: Baku-bon-no (Ëé´ÁÖ©ÊÇ©). His meaning and nuance was: \\"After you finish preparing for something (the battle), don't worry too much. Over-thinking will only make you crazy. It won't help you at all. Your agony is produced by your own mind.\\" Receiving these words, Tokimune felt ready to face his enemy. He later went on to lead the Japanese to victory. Founding of Engaku-Ji Temple After Tokimune successfully repelled a Mongolian-Korean invasion from 1274 to 1281, He commissioned a temple to be built. As a strong follower of the teachings of Zen, Tokimune had planned the construction of the temple to serve as a memorial for the dead from both sides of the conflict. It was to become the resting place of their souls. The temple was also intended to serve as a centre from which the influence of Zen could be spread. Tokimune wanted other samurai to learn how to employ the teachings of Zen Buddhism to face their problems, as he had learned through Sogen. And so, he appointed Mugaku Sogen chief priest of Engaku-ji.

Moein is best known for his street magic, large illusions, mentalism and performing close up magic for international and Arabic celebrities.  Early life  Moein Al Bastaki was born and raised in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. He is the eldest of four siblings. His love of magic began at a very young age. His grandfather, a trader, would return from trips overseas with magic tricks that he had learned. The first trick that Moein ever witnessed involved the disappearing and reappearing of a coin, which fascinated Moein and embedded a passion for the art of magic in a six- year-old child. He first performed aged 9 in a magic show that he prepared for his family. The show was not very successful, and his tricks were not well received, but his uncle paid him 5 UAE dirhams as a reward for his performance. A star was born. Moein‚Äôs father, Mohammed Al Bastaki, was the owner of a video rental shop, and as a young child, Moein became fascinated with the David Copperfield Show (1986). As his love for magic grew, he began studying the work of other internationally renowned magicians, and developing his own Arab inspired magic tricks. Moein‚Äôs biggest inspiration is Derren Brown, who triggered a passion for mentalism.  Education  Moein graduated from Al Imam Malik school in 1998. He then attended Dubai University College where he graduated, with a bachelors in Business, in 2004. Having been deprived of an education himself, Moein‚Äôs father disagreed with Moein‚Äôs choice of career, and insisted that his son focus on education instead, so Moein continued with his studies and obtained a master's degree in marketing from the University of Wollongong in Dubai in 2008.  Magic career  Moein began his magic career in 2005 with small performances for friends and relatives. His first professional performance was in 2005 for a New Year's Eve event in Dubai. From 2005 until 2010, Moein performed close up magic and stage shows at a range of events and festivals across the UAE. He finally began performing on TV and radio, with his first appearance on Sama TV in 2010. Since then, Moein has performed publicly and appeared on a number of Arabic TV shows, most recently as a weekly guest on Men El Akher, on DMTV. In 2015 Moein launched a new line of magic tricks products under his own brand that hit most of UAE and GCC toy shops. In 2016 Moein took his performances to the next stage using the power of the mind. He undertook a variety of never before seen tricks with a distinct middle eastern flavor.  Celebrity  Moein has performed tricks for a number of internationally recognized celebrities including John Travolta and Mike Tyson, WWE stars such as The Miz, John Cena, CM Punk and R-Truth, sports personalities such as Diego Maradona and Fabio Cannavaro. He has also performed for a number of famous Arabic celebrities including Sami Yusuf, Abdulhussain Abdulredha, Hayat El Fahad, Saad Al-Faraj, Ibrahim Al Sallal, Jasim El Nabhan, Ahmed El Sakka, Ahmed Bedair and Dawood Hussain.  TV Appearances  Moein has appeared on a number of TV stations including MBC, Al Arabiya, CNN, BBC, Abu Dhabi TV, Dubai One, Dubai Television, Dubai Sports, Rotana, Qatar TV, Orbit TV, DMTV and Future Television, and radio stations including MBC FM, Panorama FM, Saudi Radio and Dubai FM He has appeared on the following shows: * Men El Akher * Ya Halla (Rotana) * Saba Al Kheir Ya‚ÄôArab (MBC) * MBC this week * Inside the Middle East * Al Forsah (Sama Dubai) * Studio One (Dubai One) * BBC World News * Spotlight (OSN)  WWE  In 2017, Moein Al Bastaki became a TV presenter of a new weekly Arabic show WWE Wal3ooha on MBC Action.

Lahire studied Philosophy at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne (BA), Fine Art Film at St Martin's School of Art, London, (1984) and Film & Environmental Media at the Royal College of Art, London (MA 1986). It was at St Martin's that she entered the world of independent film, working with artists including Malcolm Le Grice, Lis Rhodes, Tina Keane, Vera Neubauer and studying alongside the film-maker Isaac Julien. Her poetic short films were made in the context of the London Film-Makers‚Äô Cooperative which ‚Äúdeveloped a new form of mixed-genre film-making [‚Ä¶.] which marked a new stage in experimental film in Britain‚Äù, according to Jacqueline Rose. Of this generation Rose has described Lahire as ‚Äúone of the most gifted, innovative and bold experimental film-makers‚Äù. Her first film, ‚Äò‚ÄôArrows‚Äô‚Äô, 1984, was a meditation on anorexia, a subject that threaded throughout her work. In 1986 she made ‚Äò‚ÄôTerminals‚Äô‚Äô, ‚Äò‚ÄôEdge‚Äô‚Äô, and ‚Äò‚ÄôPlutonium Blonde‚Äô‚Äô. In 1987, working with film-makers Jean Matthee and Anna Thew, Lahire made ‚Äò‚ÄôUranium Hex‚Äô‚Äô. ‚Äò‚ÄôSerpent River‚Äô‚Äô,1989, explored the toxic effects of a uranium mining corporation, owned by Rio Tinto Zinc, on the residents and inhabitants of Serpent River and Elliott Lake in Ontario, Canada. In 1991 she made ‚Äò‚ÄôLady Lazarus‚Äô‚Äô, the first part of a trilogy ‚Äò‚ÄôLiving on Air‚Äô‚Äô, which was inspired by the poetry of Sylvia Plath and which she made across the span of nine years. The film incorporated an interview with Plath given just before she died. The lead of ‚Äò‚ÄôLiving on Air‚Äô‚Äô was played by fellow film-maker Sarah Turner. ‚Äò‚ÄôEerie‚Äô‚Äô followed in 1992. The second part of the Plath trilogy, ‚Äò‚ÄôNight Dances‚Äô‚Äô, 1995, presented Hebrew inscriptions on worn gravestones and allusions to Yom Kippur through which Lahire explored Jewish aspects of her identity. ‚Äò‚ÄôPersephone‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äò‚ÄôKnife Born‚Äô‚Äô were made in 1997-98, with the final of the Plath trilogy, ‚Äò‚ÄôJohnny Panic‚Äô‚Äô, appearing in 1999. Marina Grzinic has noted Lahire's ‚Äúprofound filmic commentary on anorexia. The body, always that body that is coming near the image of a spectre, that is connected solely with 'air and bones' while minimizing the flesh to zero, is also the primal element she uses to establish her relationship with her surroundings, particularly with a landscape destroyed by pollution or nuclear waste.‚Äù Grzinic also underscores the centrality of light and sound in her works, with which ‚Äúshe recreated emotional situations and connections between personal obsession(s) and social structures.‚Äù An essay by Lahire, Lesbians in Media Education, appeared in the anthology Visibly Female: Feminism and Art, edited by Hilary Robinson in 1998. She also wrote an essay for Coil Magazine 'The Fairies Banquet', 1999, on Sarah Pucill's film Swollen Stigma (1998) who was her fellow filmmaker and partner at the time. For Make Magazine Issue 7, which was a special issue on the Miniature 1999, she wrote an essay, 'Little Deaths', on her film Johnny Panic (1999) and Sarah Pucill's film Cast (1999). Reflections on Lahire and her work by film-makers Sarah Pucill (who was her partner in the last 6 years of her life), Lis Rhodes (for whom Lahire wrote a score for her film Just About Now ) and Sarah Turner appeared in Vertigo magazine in Spring 2002.

The FPN - ‚ÄúFedera√ß√£o Portuguesa de Naturismo‚Äù (Portuguese Naturist Federation) - was founded on 1 March 1977, at a meeting in Lisbon. History Naturism in Portugal had its first historical record around 1920, linked to Portuguese Naturist Society, of which the anarcho-syndicalist Jos√© Peralta was a prominent member. Social Nudity was already being practiced on ‚ÄúCosta da Caparica‚Äù beaches. With the development of the dictatorial regime, the naturist movement were limited to vegetarian and alternative medicines, since nudity was banned, and associated with the crime of \\"indecency\\". Only after the end of the dictatorial regime in 1974 (April 25th) the activities linked to the practice of nudity was resumed. The FPN - ‚ÄúFedera√ß√£o Portuguesa de Naturismo‚Äù (Portuguese Naturist Federation) was founded on the 1st of March 1977, at a meeting in Lisbon. After its foundation the FPN applied to join INF/FNI-International Naturist Federation, which was then represented in Portugal by the Portuguese Vegetarian Association, which succeeded ‚ÄúSociedade Portuguesa de Naturalogia‚Äù in this task. The FPN was admitted to the International Federation in October 1977 and attended its World Congress, in the following year, already entitled with a right to vote. FPN immediately started to established contacts at the highest level, focusing in the development of legal practice in Portugal. For this purpose, a meeting was held the day after its founding with the then-Secretary of State for tourism . In its continuous struggle for the recognition of Naturism, in 1988, only a little more than a decade of various contacts, campaigns, advances and setbacks, the FPN managed to see the first Naturist Law in Portugal discussed and approved at the Portuguese Parliament, as it can be read in.the Naturism & the law FPN is the only accredited Federation in Portugal for the issuing of the \\"Naturist Identity card\\", useful and necessary to all who wish to join, with advantages in \\"naturist world\\" and in the diversity of their national and international offer. Facilities The Portuguese Naturist Federation became the coordinating entity of the naturist activity in Portugal since 1998, federating several clubs and associations, maintaining specialty cores and organizing some activities aimed preferably at its federated members, without forgetting the essential role of promoting a naturist practice in order to develop the physical and mental health of the human being, in particular, through natural means, favoring its integration in nature. Over the past 37 years, the FPN has achieved important \\"goals\\" that constitute a reference landmarks for all naturists. Some examples are: the laws 92/88, 29/94 and 53/10, the recognized official beaches of Meco, Bela Vista, Ilha de Tavira (Barril), Salto, Adegas, Alteirinhos and Deserta, the opening of the first naturist activity in a council swimming pool and in a health club, and the support given to the development of infrastructures of tourist accommodation, like the campsites ‚ÄúQuinta dos Carri√ßos‚Äù, ‚ÄúQuinta das Oliveiras‚Äù, ‚ÄúMonte Bar√£o‚Äù and ‚ÄúQuinta do Maral‚Äù .

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1973 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. History In 1853, Leland pioneer Antoine Manseau constructed a dam across the Carp River at this location. Manseau built a sawmill and docks, setting up Leland as a wooding station for steamers. By 1867, 200 people had settled in Leland. The area also began to develop a fishing fleet, with commercial increasing in importance from the 1870s through the 1890s. More development followed, and in 1886 the county seat was moved to Leland. In the early 1900s, fishermen began enclosing their open boats and adding gasoline engines, which increased the scale of fishing operations. By 1937, two breakwaters were constructed in the waters of Lake Michigan, which also facilitated the rise of the local fishing industry. However, in the 1940s, the whitefish and trout populations in the lake were decimated by sea lampreys. Although commercial fishing operations continued, the area relied more heavily on tourism and charter operations. In the 21st century, the harbor area contains a mix of commercial fishing and tourist operations. Beginning in 2019 and intensifying in 2020, many of the historic shanties have become inundated with water on a regular basis due to record high waters in Lake Michigan and increased flow from the Carp river. The owner of the site, Fishtown Preservation, is raising funds to raise, repair, and stabilize the shanties and preserve current and future fishing operations. The first shanty to be moved, on January 10, 2020, was the Village Cheese shanty, with the Morris Shanty scheduled to be raised in the winter of 2020-21. Description The Leland Historic District, containing both commercial and residential structures, is located at the mouth of the Carp River. It encompasses one of Michigan's most scenic villages; the structures in the district are substantially original, with few alterations.

It follows the troubled Eddie Carbone, whose working life becomes harder when he allows two illegal immigrants to stay in his home, which leads to tragedy. Production It was filmed in English and French versions, and its exterior sequences were filmed on location on the waterfront of Brooklyn, New York, where the play and the film take place.Crowther, Bosley, \\"Screen: 'A View From the Bridge' at the Sutton:Adaptation of Drama by Arthur Miller Bows.\\" The New York Times, January 23, 1962. Unlike the play, in which central character Eddie Carbone is stabbed to death with his own knife in a scuffle with his wife Beatrice's cousin Marco toward the end, in the film Eddie commits suicide by plunging a cargo hook into his chest.A View from the Bridge (1962), TCM/Turner Classic Movies website The film was the first time that a kiss between men was shown on screen in America, in the sequence in which an intoxicated Eddie Carbone passionately kisses his wife Beatrice's male cousin Rodolfo in an attempt to demonstrate the latter's alleged homosexuality. However, this overture was intended as an accusation of someone being gay, rather than a romantic expression.

In Film Quarterly, Pauline Kael called the film \\"not so much a drama as a sentence that's been passed on the audience.\\"Abbotson, Susan C.W., Critical Companion to Arthur Miller: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work (New York: Facts on File, Inc., an imprint of Infobase Publishing, 2007), p. 348.

A more favorable review came from The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther, who praised Sidney Lumet's realistic depiction of the Brooklyn waterfront and his choice of actors but believed that principal character Eddie Carbone lacked depth and dimension. \\"The rumbling and gritty quality of the Brooklyn waterfront,\\" he wrote, \\"the lofty and mercantile authority of the freight ships tied up at the docks, the cluttered and crowded oppressiveness of the living rooms of the dockside slums are caught in his camera's comprehension, to pound it into the viewer's head that this is an honest presentation of the sort of personal involvement that one might watch‚Äîmight spy upon‚Äîthrough a telescope set on Brooklyn Bridge.\\" However, \\"The one great obstruction to the drama ‚Äî and a fatal obstruction it becomes‚Äîis the slowly evolving demonstration that the principal character is a boor. As much as his nigh-incestuous passion and his subsequent jealousy may be credible and touching, they are low in the human emotional scale and are obviously seamy and ignoble. They haven't the universal scope of greed or envy or ambition or such obsessions as drive men to ruin.\\"Crowther, Bosley, \\"Screen: 'A View From the Bridge' at the Sutton:Adaptation of Drama by Arthur Miller Bows.\\" The New York Times, January 23, 1962. The film currently has a 67% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, which noted that \\"Director Sidney Lumet shot the film in both English and French, with the English version sounding more recited than acted at times...

The following year, they returned to Sweden. In 1888 the Larssons went to Paris, on the suggestion of Pontus F√ºrstenberg of Gothenburg, who wanted a large painting by Carl to add to his art collection. They left their two children with Karin's parents in Hallsberg, and upon their return a year later, decorated the Berg√∂√∂s' new house. They then moved into Lilla Hyttn√§s, a stuga (cottage) in Sundborn on the outskirts of Falun where her father had been born. They enlarged it to accommodate their growing family and it became known as the Larsson farm. rocking chair designed by Karin Larsson Karin acted as a sounding-board and critic for Carl's work, in addition to being his primary model. With children and a large house to manage, she channelled her own artistic impulses into design. She designed and wove a large amount of the textiles used in the house, embroidered, and designed clothes for herself and the children and furniture which was created by a local carpenter.Paul Greenhalgh, Quotations and Sources on Design and the Decorative Arts, Manchester: Manchester University, 1993, , p. 102. For example, the pinafores worn by her and other women who worked at Sundborn, known as karinf√∂rkl√§de in Swedish, were a practical design by her.

It was introduced as a general-purpose material for use in constructing electronic circuits - differing from purpose-designed printed circuit boards (PCBs) in that a variety of electronics circuits may be constructed using a standard wiring board. The first single-size Veroboard product was the forerunner of the numerous types of prototype wiring board which, with worldwide use over five decades, have become known as stripboard. The generic terms 'veroboard' and 'stripboard' are now taken to be synonymous.  History  Veroboard Patent. By the mid-1950s, the printed circuit board (PCB) had become commonplace in electronics production. In early 1959, the VPE Electronics Department was formed when managing director Geoffrey Verdon-Roe hired two former Saunders-Roe Ltd employees, Peter H Winter (aircraft design department) and Terry Fitzpatrick (electronics division). After the failure of a project to develop machine tool control equipment, the department remained operative as a result of success with the invention and development of the new electronics material - Veroboard. New equipment using PCBs was displayed at the 1959 Radio and Electronics Components Manufacturers Federation (RECMF) Exhibition held in The Dorchester Hotel, Park Lane, London.The Dorchester Hotel has no existing record for 1959 events. The usual configuration for most of the PCBs of that time had components placed in a regular pattern with the circuit formed by maze-like conductive pathways. An interesting alternative, proposed by Fitzpatrick after visiting the RECMF Exhibition on behalf of VPE, envisaged a standard circuit board carrying straight-line conductors on which the components could be suitably dispersed and connected to the conductors to produce the required circuit. A patent application was immediately filed 25 May 1959 and the invention was developed for Vero by associates Winter, Fitzpatrick and machine shop engineers.  Production  Production of the proposed new product, Veroboard, was undertaken by the VPE machine tool department. Bought-in sheets of 1.6 mm (0.06 in) copper-clad SRBP printed circuit material were cut to give 122 mm x 456 mm (4.8 in x 18 in) size boards with the individual boards then being machined to form the final product according to the original Veroboard specification.,Wikimedia Commons A multiple milling cutter tool, which comprised a bank of side-and-face cutters with suitably shaped cutting teeth, was fabricated - to be used in removing part of the bonded copper on each board leaving 21 conductive strips.Google Images For a second operation a special tool with 63 hardened punch bits 1.35 mm (0.052 in) in diameter mounted on a solid base block was constructed to repeat-punch a matrix of holes, on spacing, through the copper strips and the base board. Many dimensional, material quality, and tooling problems were encountered before finished boards of acceptable quality could be produced in quantity. These machining problems were encountered due to the non- availability, in 1960, of advanced printed circuit board milling and drilling techniques or facilities for chemical milling (etching) the copper strips. In 1961, as production rates improved with experience, Vero Electronics Ltd was formed as a separate company to market the increasing sales of Veroboard.  Use  As with other stripboards, in using Veroboard, components are suitably positioned and soldered to the conductors to form the required circuit. Breaks can be made in the tracks, usually around holes, to divide the strips into multiple electrical nodes enabling increased circuit complexity. This type of wiring board may be used for initial electronic circuit development, to construct prototypes for bench testing or in the production of complete electronic units in small quantity. Veroboard was first used for prototype construction within Vero Electronics Department in 1961. The images of a binary decade counter sub-unit clearly show both the assembled components and the copper conductors with the required discontinuities. 1961 Veroboard Display Board. A number of these sub-units were interconnected through connectors mounted on a motherboard similar to that shown in the Veroboard Display image and comprised a very early PCB-based backplane system. Each sub- unit had a digital capacity equivalent to 1/2 byte of data storage - i.e. 2,000,000 would be required to store 1 megabyte. Two forms of Veroboard are produced with hole pitch of 2.54 mm (0.1 in) or 3.5 mm (0.15 in). The larger pitch is and was considered easier to assemble, especially at a time when many constructors were still more familiar with valves and tag strips. The increasingly popular integrated circuits in dual in-line packages would only fit the 0.1 boards. Very soon 0.1 pitch became by far the dominant form. Integrated circuits and the common layout of short parallel strips protruding from the sides of an IC package encouraged the development of specialist boards such as Verostrip. This was a long, thin board with the copper strips arranged transversely, rather than the usual lengthwise. A ready-cut central gap was provided to isolate the sides of the IC. A 1979 Vero Electronics Ltd production drawing shows a special Veroboard product made for RS Components Ltd.,Vero Electronics production drawing The versatility of the veroboard/stripboard type of product is demonstrated by the large number of design examples currently (2013-07) to be found on the Internet.Google Images  Update  The advent of the Arduino integrated development environment, designed to introduce computer programming to newcomers unfamiliar with software development, presents a new opportunity to use Veroboard. Arduino development regularly involves the use of 'shields', which plug into the main Arduino board using standard 0.1 in header connections and carry project- specific I/O hardware. However the Arduino design makes this difficult, as one of the four header sockets is offset from the 0.1 in spacing of the others by 0.05 in. The British company Vero Technologies Ltd currently holds the UK trademark for Veroboard., Intellectual Property Office website In the Americas the Veroboard trademark is now held by the Canadian company Pixel Print Ltd. of Vancouver.

The group believes that a race war or general civil war, sometimes referred to as \\"Uhuru\\" or the \\"Night of the Long Knives,\\" is coming in South Africa as a result of a white genocide. They anticipate an eventual collapse of infrastructure, and advocate and plan for an evacuation of white South Africans from major cities in the event of a race war. Their leader is Gustav M√ºller. The group has claimed significant success in raising global awareness of the alleged threat, following a 2017 tour to the United States by spokesperson Simon Roche, and has also taken credit for an offer by Australian government minister Peter Dutton to preferentially grant refugee visas to white South African farmers.  History and beliefs  The Suidlanders were formed in 2006 by Gustav M√ºller, who still heads the organization. M√ºller is quoted in a video recording of 28 May 2016 as saying \\"My actual calling (vocation) is to bring the Boer people back to God.\\" Which echoes the few minor hand-picked principles of Christian ethos of the organisation. The organization's activity increased after the murder of Eug√®ne Terre'Blanche, an Afrikaner nationalist, which although did not trigger massive social unrest, did lust far-right organizations and some conservative groups in South Africa. The Suidlanders currently claim to be a civil organisation that is close to illegal in their own country. The group explicitly distances itself from neo- Nazi organisations, though they take credit for propagating the white genocide conspiracy theory. The Suidlanders say that they are loosely inspired by the prophecies of Siener van Rensburg, a peasant farmer who served as a spiritual adviser to several Boer military leaders during the Second Boer War who they believe predicted a massive civil insurrection will lead to a alleged race war in South Africa. In the wake of Nelson Mandela's death - (A man that passively protested against racial bias himself. ) The Suidlanders estimated the \\"revolution risk\\" in South Africa as 50 percent, and said it would be a great time to \\"go on holiday,\\" a coded statement involving demonising the prophesied \\"Uhuru\\" or \\"Night of Long Knives,\\" when blacks would allegedly kill whites in South Africa.  Leadership and management  The Suidlanders is led by an executive council composed of Louis de la Gey, Bertus Schwan, Ben van Rensburg, and Hans van der Poel. Their public face is Simon Roche. They have received donations from a variety of far-right and white Nationalists: the neo-confederate League of the South, Identity Evropa founder Nathan Damigo, and American Vanguard. They also received $40,000 on FreeStartr, the defunct alt-right Patreon alternative. The Suidlanders conduct training in all aspects of civil defence throughout the year. The training includes logistics and operations, control of refugees, first aid, firearms training, and communication.  White genocide  The Suidlanders took credit for increasing minimising severity of racially-based hate crimes. They believe anti-white racism to be imminent; also claiming credit for increasing coverage of the issue by figures such as Katie Hopkins, and for an offer by Australian cabinet minister Peter Dutton to resettle white South Africans as refugees. However, the Suidlanders spokesman Simon Roche rejected the idea, as the Afrikaners from South Africa.

In the 21st century, the complex is included within the Cotahuasi Subbasin Landscape Reserve. Description Mawk'allaqta is believed to be an administrative center developed by the Wari culture, which was active about 500CE to 1000CE, prior to the Inca Empire. The large archeological complex is located on a plateau between the Huarcaya and Sumana rivers, which merge downstream to form the Cotahuasi River. Approximately 50 stone structures have been identified on the site, which includes about 25 tombs on the east side of the complex. The complex was strategically located, enabling Inca control of the trading routes between Cusco and the coast. The Capac √ëan network intersected here with the Contisuyo networks and connected the heart of Tahuantinsuyo Cuzco with the coast of Arequipa.

The Detroit Kennel Club is a member club of the American Kennel Club.  History  The Detroit Kennel Club originally had its first show in April 1916. The show was located at the Detroit Naval Armory on East Jefferson Avenue in Detroit. Since then, the shows location has been moved various times. Until the 1920s, the shows location would change between the Naval Armory and the Michigan State Fairgrounds. In the 1920s, the shows location was changed to the Detroit Convention Hall on Canfield Avenues. The show remained at the Detroit Convention Hall until 1949 when it was relocated back to the Michigan State Fairgrounds. The show remained in the Fairgrounds for 15 years until it was moved to the Cobo Convention Center on Jefferson and Washington in downtown Detroit. It has remained at the Cobo Convention Center. The original show catalogs cost twenty-five cents. By the 1920s, the price of the catalogs went up to fifty cents. The show quickly became popular. It started out as a small show with four judges at the original show. Many of the upper-class families of Detroit joined the club and caused the club to have 250 members, just one year after the original show. In the first few years, the show didn‚Äôt have a set time of year. It varied until the 1920s when it became set in March. All of these dogs were inspected for distemper and other diseases before they could enter the show. Up to twenty veterinarians worked at the shows to make sure the dogs were healthy and behaved. All of the dogs at the show had to stay on their benches until 10 PM when the show doors would close. They could only leave their benches at certain times to exercise. All of the Detroit Kennel Club shows are benched shows so that the audience can meet and pet the dogs. Today there are only five other benched shows in the United States including Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Portland and New York. The largest entry at the club was 3798 dogs in 1978. The largest breed entry was 223 Borzoi dogs.  Noteworthy shows  2013 Best in Show Winner, CRISPY LEGACY, Fox Terriers (Wire) The annual show has been cancelled for the year 2014, which breaks a streak of 98 years since it was first held. The primary reason for the cancellation in 2014 was because the club has not been able to find new sponsors ever since their primary sponsor, the pet food maker Purina, ended the sponsorship in 2010. The show costs around $100,000 annually and due to lack of support, it could not reach that target. The Detroit Kennel Club shows have had many famous people attend them. In 1931, Ethel Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge from New Jersey attended the show as the Shepherd Dog Judge. Dodge is the daughter of William Rockefeller, the co-founder of Standard Oil. Erik Bergishagen, the father of the current Detroit Kennel Club president also attended that same show which was showing two Jagersbo Pointers and English Setters.  Future  The club plans to continue fundraising efforts and to revive the show, possibly at a different venue. According to the club's show chairman, Richard Ford, the intention is to pursue sponsors for 2015.

The Sanskrit word cƒÅmara means \\"chowrie\\" or \\"yak-tail,\\" which is an insignia of royalty Summary The standard texts on Hindu astrology have given three versions of CƒÅmara yoga. According to Parashara CƒÅmara yoga arises if Jupiter aspects the exalted lord of the lagna situated in a kendrasthana or if two benefic planets combine in the lagna, in the 7th, in the 10th or in the 9th bhava. The person will be a king, honoured by kings, long lived, scholarly, eloquent and versed in all arts. This Raja yoga is based on the placement of the lord of the lagna in the auspicious bhavas beneficially influenced by the most benefic planet, Jupiter. In this event the lord of the lagna becomes the Raja yoga-karaka. Janardan Harji begins the Raja yoga section of Mansagari stating ‚Äì If at the time of birth the lord of lagna vested with strength is a kendrasthana or in a trikonasthana or in the 11th house from the lagna the person will be blessed with the whole paraphernalia befitting a king; the person if lowly born will live like a king. Parashara himself states that if the yoga-kƒÅraka is in an auspicious bhava, sign or navamsa it makes one blessed with plenty of wealth but if such an auspicious planet is in a kendrasthana the person becomes a ruler; if the rasi or navamsa or drekkena rising in the lagna-bhava, ghati- lagna and hora-lagna or any two are aspected by a strong planet a Raja yoga will arise. Even otherwise, the exalted lord of the lagna occupying a kendrasthana will be causing a Panch Mahapurusha yoga. Vaidyanatha Dikshita has given the Parasari description of CƒÅmara yoga in his Jataka Parijata and states that the person will be either a philosopher, wise, eloquent, and held high in esteem by kings or be a king who being competent by birth to enter on the study of the sacred scriptures has mastered everything connected therewith and live for seventy-one years. Mantreswara gives a different version of CƒÅmara yoga. In Sloka 44 of Chapter VI of his Phaladeepika, he states that ‚Äì if the lagna is either occupied or aspected by a benefic planet, the lord of the lagna is not combust and is in an auspicious bhava in its own sign or own vargas, then CƒÅmara yoga is caused; the person blessed with this yoga will be good-looking, attractive, intelligent, wealthy, respected and a king who will prosper like the bright-half waxing Moon. This yoga highlights the importance of the strength of the lord of the lagna and the benefic influence it happens to receive. According to Jatakadesh Marga, which states:- :‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§™‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•á ‡§¶‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ ‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§≤‡§ó‡•ç‡§®‡•á‡§∂‡•á ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡•ã‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö‡§≠‡§Ç ‡§ó‡§§‡•á  :‡§ß‡§®‡§ï‡•á‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§ó‡§§‡•á ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ‡•á ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§æ‡§Æ‡§∞‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§ï‡§É CƒÅmara yoga will arise for the person born in the day-time on a shukla-paksha (period of brightening of the Moon) tithi who has the lord of the lagna occupying its exaltation sign and Jupiter is either in the 2nd house or in a kendrasthana from the lagna. The basis of this Raja yoga formation is the strength of the lord of the lagna, the lagna-kendra and the 10th house and with the Moon shining brightly in the night-sky and the Sun occupying the 9th, the 10th or the 11th bhava counted from the lagna. Jupiter situated in a kendrasthana, trikonasthana or the 11th house from the lagna cancels the adverse effects of all weak planets if there be any, and makes one lead a grand life.

She served as a spy and courier for the rebels.  Early life = Family Life  Agueda Monasterio de Lattapiat was born into a middle class home in Chile. She was born to Antonia Lemus Silva and Don Ignacio Monasterio. Both families were well known and respected. Don Ignacio Monasterio was a merchant creating a comfortable life for Agueda and her seven siblings. Four of the children were boys and the other four were girls.Amunategui , M. L., & D. B., Arana.

He was a French naval officer whose reputation relied on his defense of the port of Buenos Aires.  Marriage  Jean Lattapiat was employed by the French navy in order to defend the port of Buenos Aires, after the British launched a naval attack. Politician, writer, and journalist Vicente Grez noted about the couple that \\"his sword was known and feared, but her character was also as strong as steel.\\" Together they had five children, Francisco, Bruno, Juan, Manuela and Juana.  Involvement in the Revolution = First Noted Display of Bravery  Royalists wanted to have the Crown remain in power, and to suppress any revolution that might occur. Tension was so high during this time \\"that virtually every man in Santiago carried a weapon in the streets.\\" Often fighting broke out in the middle of the street, this was generally known as \\"Figueroa's mutiny.\\" This time, though her son was caught in the gunfire on April 1, 1811. Her earliest display of bravery and willingness to die for her children, as she ran amidst gunfire to bring her fallen son to safety.  Her Part in the Revolution  During this time a restriction was placed by the Spanish Crown on trading with the French, English, and Americans. Using this anger and oppression she encouraged tradesmen to be politically discontent. This is important because of the vast number of places tradesmen visit and the large number of people they see. If one tradesmen is discontent many more may follow his influence. This spreads the Revolutionary spirit as well as aid for it. Those that felt strongly about the independence of Chile could learn from the tradesmen what like minded people were doing and where they were meeting. Agueda was an essential part of the spying in Chile.√Ågueda Monasterio: una integrante del servicio de informaciones durante la Reconquista en Chile. (n.d.). Retrieved December 04, 2017, Her name was easily known due to her and her husband's prosperous families, making it understandable people would be at her house often. Her house was also in an extremely convenient location, becoming the hub of information.R. Adams, Jerome: Notable Latin American Women: Twenty-nine Leaders, Rebels, Poets, Battlers and spies, 1500-1900 MacFarland (1995) Vicente Grez states,R. Adams, Jerome: Notable Latin American Women: Twenty-nine Leaders, Rebels, Poets, Battlers and spies, 1500-1900 MacFarland (1995) Agueda and her daughter, Juana, sent secret letters between committees that were involved in organizing the revolt in their own home. She became responsible for the incoming and outgoing mail of exiled officials. The messages Agueda Monasterio De Lattapiat sent notified exiled officials of the rebel news of Chile. These notifications would help the exiles plan an attack on the Spaniards in Chile at the perfect time. Jean Lattapiat worked for Chile's independence, thus making him an exile. This added persecution of her husband put an emotional strain of Agueda. Agueda was well known in Chile due to her family history with Spanish Royalty and her husband's military background. While this did help with the goings and coming of rebels it made it difficult for her to send information to the officials. The Spanish government became suspicious of her spying and soon warned her that if she continued she would go to prison.  Time in Jail  After continuing to spy, send letters and being a hub for the revolution, she was thrown into prison. In late 1816 a second revolution was stirring from the patriots and the Royalists wanted her to reveal her contacts. They believed this would prevent another revolution. At the risk of her own life she refused to reveal her allies. The Spanish governor ordered gallows to be built in the city's main plaza, so she could see it from her cell. She was not allowed to speak to her family or any friends. This alone was painful but the interrogations were mentally straining and the lack of food weakened her physical strength. When the display of imminent death did not deter her, the Spanish governor, known to be \\"capable of ferocious cruelty\\" threatened to cut off her daughter's' hand as she watched. Not only would cutting off her hand affect Agueda's emotional state but Juana was very involved in the revolution as well. At this threat from the Spanish King Royalists stepped in to stop this insane plan. They released her from prison, and escorted Agueda and Juana home. This was not because of compassion for Agueda but her strong popularity with the people would most certainly cause an uprising.  Death  Agueda Monasterio De Lattapiat died a few days after her release from prison. The mental and emotional strain had proven to be fatal. She died on February 6, 1817, six days before the patriots Victory at Chacabuco on February 12, 1817.  References  * Amunategui, M. L., & D. B., Arana. (1877). Revista chilena (Vol. 9) (J.

Early life and education A native of Sussex, Ingamells attended Hastings and Eastbourne Grammar Schools, and subsequently graduated from Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge (then Fitzwilliam House) before undergoing National Service in Cyprus. Career Ingamells's career in the arts began in 1959 when he joined York Art Gallery as an art assistant to the curator Hans Hess, and later joined the art department of the National Museum of Wales as assistant keeper in 1963. Ingamells published The Davies Collection of French Art, a catalogue of the National Museum of Wales's French art collection in 1967, and upon its publication returned to York as director of the York Art Gallery. During Ingamells tenure in York he wrote and published articles on the French painter Philippe Mercier, with Robert Raines, and on the Italian portraitist Andrea Soldi for the Walpole Society. Ingamells joined the Wallace Collection in London as assistant to the collection's director, Terence Hodgkinson, in 1977, before succeeding Hodgkinson as director in 1978. The Wallace Collection did not lend artworks or stage exhibitions in Ingamells initial years as director, and so Ingamell worked on improving the interiors of the museum and revising the Wallace Collection's catalogue. Ingamells joined the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art after his retirement in 1992. In 1997 Ingamells published A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy, 1701-1800, a dictionary of more than 6,000 travellers and artists who had embarked on the Grand Tour. The book arose out of material collected by the art historian Sir Brinsley Ford. He co-edited an edition of the letters of Joshua Reynolds with John Edgcumbe that was published in 2000. Personal life Ingamells was married to his second wife, Hazel Wilson, from 1964 to 2012, they had two daughters. Ingamells suffered from cancer at the end of his life.

The bill would change some environmental regulations and stop or delay a project designed to restore a dried up section of the San Joaquin River (a habitat for some salmon). The bill was considered highly partisan and there are disputes over how much it would solve the water problem, or even intended to solve it, as opposed to an election year ploy unlikely to pass Congress. It passed the United States House of Representatives on February 5, 2014 during the 113th United States Congress. Background United States Drought Monitor from February 4, 2014 California‚Äôs interconnected water system serves over 30 million people and irrigates over of farmland. As the world‚Äôs largest, most productive, and most controversial water system, it manages over of water per year. California has had water problems for decades. The state is forced to contend with the different needs and wants of the agriculture industry, environmentalists, and everyday home water consumers. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act has several titles. Title I: Central Valley Project Water Reliability Title I would amend the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) to include among the Act's purposes: (1) to ensure that water dedicated to fish and wildlife purposes is replaced and provided to Central Valley Project (CVP) water contractors by December 31, 2018, at the lowest cost reasonably achievable, and (2) to facilitate and expedite water transfers in accordance with that Act. The bill would redefine \\"anadromous fish\\" for purposes of such Act. It would also define \\"reasonable flows\\" as water flows capable of being maintained taking into account competing consumptive uses of water and economic, environmental, and social factors. It would eliminate existing limitations on the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to enter into any new contracts for water supply from the CVP. It would direct the Secretary to renew any existing long-term repayment or water service contract, upon request of the contractor, that provides for the delivery of water from the CVP for a period of 40 years (the current contractual term is 25 years). It would require new or renewed contracts to include a provision that requires the Secretary to charge only for water actually delivered. It would direct the Secretary to take all necessary actions to facilitate and expedite CVP water transfers in accordance with such Act or any other provision of federal reclamation law and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). It would grant the Secretary discretion to modify CVP operations to provide reasonable water flows of suitable quality, quantity, and timing to protect all life stages of anadromous fish. It would repeal a requirement that not less than 67% of all funds made available to the Restoration Fund under CVPIA be authorized to be appropriated to carry out habitat restoration, improvement, and acquisition provisions of that Act. The bill would require the CVP and the California State Water Project (SWP) to be operated pursuant to the water quality standards and operational constraints described in the \\"Principles for Agreement of the Bay-Delta Standards Between the State of California and the Federal Government,\\" dated December 15, 1994 (Bay-Delta Accord of 1994), without regard to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) or any other law pertaining to the operation of the CVP and the SWP. The bill would prohibit the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce from distinguishing between natural-spawned and hatchery-spawned or otherwise artificially propagated strains of a species in making any determination under ESA that relates to any anadromous fish species that are present in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers or their tributaries and that ascend those rivers and their tributaries to reproduce after maturing in the San Francisco Bay or the Pacific Ocean. The bill would add the Kettleman City Community Services District as an authorized service area of the CVP. The bill would direct the Secretary to enter into a long-term contract for the delivery of up to 900 acre-feet of CVP water for municipal and industrial use. The bill would direct the Secretary to offer to the Oakdale Irrigation District, the South San Joaquin Irrigation District, and the Calaveras County Water District a contract enabling such districts to collectively impound and store a portion of their Stanislaus River water rights in the New Melones Reservoir in accordance with applicable terms of the Warren Act. The bill would establish a pilot program to remove non-native predatory fish from the Stanislaus River. The bill would direct the Secretary, if the San Luis Reservoir does not fill by the last day of February, to permit any entity with an agricultural water service or repayment contract for the delivery of water from the Delta Division or the San Luis Unit to reschedule into the immediately following contract year (i.e., March 1 through the last day of February) any unused CVP water previously allocated for irrigation purposes. Title II: San Joaquin River Restoration - Title II would direct the Secretary of the Interior to cease any action to implement the Stipulation of Settlement dated September 13, 2006, in the litigation entitled Natural Resources Defense Council, et al. v. Kirk Rodgers, et al., U.S. District Court, Eastern District of California. The bill would amend the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act to eliminate references to such Stipulation of Settlement and to direct the Secretary, beginning on March 1, 2015, to modify Friant Dam operations to release restoration flows in a manner that improves the fishery in the San Joaquin River between Friant Dam and Gravelly Ford. The bill would direct the Secretary, prior to October 1, 2015, to: (1) identify the impacts associated with the release of such restoration flows; (2) identify measures necessary to mitigate impacts on adjacent and downstream water users, landowners, and agencies as a result of such restoration flows; and (3) implement all such mitigation measures identified before such restoration flows are commenced. The bill would repeat provisions relating to settlement of litigation regarding restoration of the San Joaquin River reintroduction of the California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon into such River. Title III: Repayment Contracts and Acceleration of Repayment of Construction Costs - Title III would direct the Secretary of the Interior, upon request of the contractor, to convert all existing long-term CVP contracts to contracts that require a contractor to pay the remaining balance of construction at a Treasury rate discount. Title IV: Bay-Delta Watershed Water Rights Preservation and Protection - Title IV would direct the Secretary of the Interior (notwithstanding the provisions of this Act, federal reclamation law, or the ESA), in the operation of CVP, to: (1) strictly adhere to state water rights law governing water rights priorities by honoring water rights senior to those belonging to CVP, regardless of the source of priority; and (2) strictly adhere to and honor water rights and other priorities that are obtained or that exist under the California Water Code. The bill would require any action taken by the Secretary or the Secretary of Commerce to protect any species listed under the ESA that affects the diversion of water or involves the release of water from any CVP water storage facility to be applied in a manner that is consistent with water rights priorities established by state law. The bill would direct the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce, in implementing the ESA in the Bay-Delta and on the Sacramento River, to apply any limitations on the operation of CVP or to formulate any reasonable prudent alternative associated with CVP's operation in a manner that strictly adheres to and applies water rights priorities for project water and base supply provided for in the Sacramento River settlement contracts. The bill would direct the Secretary, subject to the absolute priority of Sacramento River settlement contractors, to allocate water provided for irrigation purposes to existing CVP agricultural water service contractors within the Sacramento River Watershed. The bill would direct the Secretary to ensure that there are no redirected adverse water supply or fiscal impacts to those within the Sacramento River or San Joaquin River watershed or to the SWP arising from the Secretary's operation of CVP to meet legal obligations. Title V: Miscellaneous - Title V declares that: (1) coordinated operations between CVP and SWP, previously requested and consented to by the state of California and the federal government, require assertion of federal supremacy to protect existing water rights throughout the system; (2) these circumstances are unique to California; and (3) nothing in this Act shall serve as precedent in any other state. The bill would declare that this Act shall not affect the Proclamation of State of Emergency and the associated executive order issued on January 17, 2014, by the Governor of California. The bill would amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to: (1) decrease the length of a segment of the Lower Merced River in California designated as a wild and scenic river; and (2) revise provisions concerning the water surface level of Lake McClure in Mariposa County, California. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, a public domain source. H.R. 3964 would amend the Central Valley Project Improvement Act and the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act to change water management plans and environmental restoration goals for the Central Valley region in California. The bill would authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to convert some water service contracts to accelerated repayment contacts, which would increase receipts to the federal government in the first few years after enactment, but reduce receipts in subsequent years. Staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that some of those accelerated payments would be financed with bonds exempt from federal taxation, leading to a revenue loss. The bill also would impose a specified timeline for water transfers among the Central Valley Project contractors and would deem certain water transfers to have met the requirements of some environmental laws. CBO expects that those changes would result in more water transfers, leading to additional offsetting receipts of $1 million annually. Procedural history The Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on January 29, 2014 by Rep. David Valadao (R-CA). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources. The bill was sponsored by the California Republican congressmen - all 15 of them. On February 5, 2014, the House voted in Roll Call Vote #50 to pass the bill 229-191. Debate and discussion The 68 page bill was supported primarily by Republicans. The White House threatened to veto the bill. Republican supporters of the bill argued that the current situation prioritized the well-being of fish over human farmers. They blamed the federal government and environmental legislation for the ongoing water problems. Some Democrats insisted that the problem was not environmental regulation, but a lack of rain. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) said that \\"it would be more productive for this body (Congress) to join in a rain dance on the floor today than to pass this bill.\\" California governor Jerry Brown opposed the bill, saying that it \\"falsely suggests the promise of water relief when that is simply not possible given the scarcity of water supplies.\\" Environmental groups and Democrats opposing the bill have argued that it is a \\"political power play that undermines years of delicate negotiations.\\" Democrats accused Republicans of pursuing the bill not to solve the water problems, but to gain votes in the November 2014 congressional elections from people in districts hit hard by the drought. In that sense, Democratic Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer proposed a 31-page emergency drought legislation of $300 million aid, and to speed up environmental reviews of water projects, so state and federal officials have \\"operational flexibility\\" to move water from the delta to San Joaquin Valley farms.

The church was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on December 11, 1993 as part of the Baroque Churches of the Philippines, a collection of four Baroque Spanish-era churches.Dacumos, Jane (2012-08-03). \\"The Nuestra Se√±ora de la Asuncion ‚Äì Ilocos Sur\\". Vigattin tourism. Retrieved on 2014-01-24. The Santa Maria Church is an attraction to both tourists and Catholics in Ilocos Sur. It is not only a reminiscent of the four centuries of Spanish domination of that area but also a unique structure with a diversified architectural design of bricks and mortar. It was built on top of a hill not only as a lookout and a citadel but as a religious center during the early administration of the region by both the friars and soldiers of Spain. History The parish of Santa Maria started as a chapel-of-ease (visita) of Narvacan, its neighboring town to the north, in 1567. The influx of the settlers after the full conquest of the Ilocos Region by the Spaniards greatly increased the population of Santa Maria. The chapel became an independent ministry in 1769 and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary under the title of Our Lady of the Assumption.National Historical Institute Besides economic progress, evangelical missions were expanded. The mission at Santa Maria, located on a narrow flat plain between the sea and the central mountain range of Luzon, close to the interior settlements, made Santa Maria as the center of both the religious and commercial activities. According to the legend, before the Santa Maria Church was built on its present site, the Virgin Mary was enshrined at a different place called Bulala. The frequent disappearance of the Virgin Mary from her previous place of enthronement only to be found perched on a guava tree that grew where the present church is located, had led the townspeople to move the church to its present location. Father Mariano Dacanay, the Ilocano parish priest from 1 September 1902 to 27 May 1922 has another variation of this legend which he assures, was gathered from reliable sources. He relates that the Blessed Virgin was enthroned in another chapel that was formerly erected below the present church and what is now the East Central Elementary School compound. Father Dacanay adds, that from this chapel, the Virgin Mary made her peregrinations to that guava tree on the knoll. This version of Father Dacanay of the legend gains greater probability if not credence for today, one of the twin structures bearing the features and architectural designs of what could have been a chapel or a church by then obtaining standards remains intact in said school compound and presently used as a classroom for grade school pupils. Numerous and varying legends or stories about the Virgin Mother have long become part of Philippine religious lore. And if any one of them could be accepted as truth, then it is the blessed Virgin herself who manifested in a miraculous way her preference of a site for her permanent home. Construction of the present church was started in 1765.\\"Nuesta Senora de la Asuncion\\". World Monuments Fund. Retrieved on 2014-02-06. In 1810, the bell tower was built during the renovation of the church and furnished with a bell the following year. During the renovation of church complex in 1863, the protective wall around the sides of the hill was constructed. After the bell tower was remodeled the same year, its foundation must have gradually settled down making the imposing structure slightly leaning or tilting as it appears today. The convent was greatly renovated in 1895. Many foreigners who traveled to the north and saw the church were much impressed by its size and setting calling the church as a cathedral. Henry Savage Landor, an English painter, writer and explorer who visited the Philippines in 1900, says: > At Santa Maria a most picturesque church is to be found, reached on an > imposing flight of steps. An enormous convent stands beside the church, upon > a terrace some 80 feet above the plaza. There are a number of brick > buildings, schoolhouses and office, which must have been very handsome but > are tumbling down, the streets being in the absolute possession of sheeps, > goats and hogs. A great expanse of level land was now well-cultivated into > paddy fields and across it is a road fifteen feet wide, well-metalled and > with a sandy surface. Barrios and homes were scattered all around the plain. The massive and imposing structure of the Santa Maria Church is not only an interesting landmark but it is also a memorial to the intrepid Christian missionaries who sacrificed and devoted their lives to spread the Christian faith in this region; the natives and the men of technical knowledge who erected the great structure and others who may in one way or another are credited to the building of the Santa Maria Church. The church was listed as one of the most endangered monuments in the world by World Monuments Fund in the 2010 World Monuments Watch, along with the Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras and San Sebastian Church (Manila). All of the sites were taken off the list in 2011 after the passage of the National Cultural Heritage Act.https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/philippine-daily- inquirer/20091109/284082022674268 Design Unlike other town churches in the Philippines, which conform to the Spanish tradition of sitting them on the central plaza, the Church and Convent of Our Lady of the Assumption in Santa Maria are situated on a hill surrounded by a defensive wall on all sides like a fortress. The church is reached by climbing an 85-step stairway of granite rock. The grand three-flight stairway leads to a courtyard in front of the church doorway where a sweeping view of the lower plains and the town of Santa Maria is beheld. A narrow roadway coming from the back of the church also leads up to the courtyard but only used on special occasions. Facade The church brick fa√ßade has one large portal with three windows. The recessed arched entrance is flanked by a pair of rectangular pilaster dividing the fa√ßade into three well-defined planes. The whole facade is then framed on the sides by heavy circular buttresses topped by urn-like finials. An open pediment in the upper fa√ßade is topped by a small cupola. The curvilinear shape of the pediment serves as a graceful finish to the upward movement of the pilasters and the arch entrance. The blind niche, urn-shaped pinnacles and even proportions-overlooking at the top are decorative devices of the upward movement.\\"Sta. Maria Church, Sta. Maria Ilocos Sur.JPG\\". Wikimedia Commons. Nave The church follows the standard Philippine layout with the facade fronting a long single nave rectangular building. The church measures about long and wide.Measured using Google Earth. The thick outer walls have delicately carved side entrances with few openings. The eastern and western side of the outer walls are reinforced by thirteen huge rectangular buttresses each typical of Earthquake Baroque architecture. The first buttress from the front is adorned by a huge relief retelling how the statue of Our Lady of Assumption was found on top of a tree. The relief is visible as one ascends the front stairway. The middle buttress on the eastern wall (back) is built like a staircase for easy maintenance of the roof back when thatched roof was the norm in Philippine churches, before the advent of corrugated galvanised iron (CGI). The lighter CGI roof is also preferred in earthquake-prone areas than tile roof. Bell tower The bell tower is freestanding, constructed separate from the church and not parallel to the facade but situated about a third of the wall from the front. The octagonal four-story tower was built wide, with each level narrowing till it reaches the top, typical of earthquake baroque church towers. The top floor is covered by a dome that is capped by cupola. A cross above the cupola tops the structure. Blank walls are arranged alternately with open windows. Other decorative devices, like single pilasters, finials and balustrades indicate that this form is of later vintage. A clock on the third level faces the stairway for the churchgoers to see.

The placement of the convent in front of the church and not adjacent is another unusual characteristic of the building, probably dictated by the long narrow hill on which the church is located. It is accessible from the church by an elevated stone walkway. In the early days of the colonization, the convent was the seat of the ecclesiastical administration as well as home of the church clergies. Under the elevated walkway is a gate that leads to the back courtyard with a commanding view of the back countryside. Cemetery Another wide stairway, similar to the front, leads down from the courtyard to a brick walkway that leads to an old abandoned cemetery evergreen with brush and weeds.Imagine.asia.

National Historical Landmark The National Historical Institute (now the National Historical Commission of the Philippines) installed a marker next to the door of Santa Maria Church following Executive Order nos. 260 on August 1, 1973, 375 on January 14, 1974 and 1515 on June 11, 1978 declaring the Santa Maria Church as a National Historical Landmark. National Cultural Treasure With Republic Act No. 10066 - National Cultural Heritage Act of 2009 in place, all structures 50 years or older, structures with historical markers, and all structures designed by National Artists (regardless of age) are now presumed to be declared and cannot be demolished or altered without the permission of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA). This is an attempt to compile all lists of formally declared cultural and historical structures and sites in the Philippines and make it available to the public via the Internet since the National Museum (NM) and National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP), both under the NCCA, maintain their own lists.

The riots were the most violent scenes the country had seen since the end of the Bosnian War in 1995. The rioting largely took place in the entity of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the same level of unrest or activism did not occur in Republika Srpska. Some news sources, such as BBC and The New York Times, used the name Bosnian Spring when describing the riots, a terminology taken from other events such the Arab Spring and the Prague Spring. The Swedish politician Carl Bildt also said that \\"in some places there has been talk about a Bosnian Spring\\". Most of the riots calmed down by 8 February, although protesting continued throughout the days that followed. By April 2014, the protests had faded away due to decreasing participation. A Balkan Insight article said they \\"ran out of steam.\\" Background After World War II, Tuzla developed into a major industrial and cultural centre during the communist period in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. During the first decade of the 21st century, four former state- owned companies, including furniture and washing powder factories, were sold to private owners who were contracted to invest in and make them profitable. Instead, the new owners opted for asset stripping, stopped paying workers and filed for bankruptcy. The closures left hundreds of workers without jobs in a country that already has a high unemployment rate of between 27%‚Äì47%. Although official data show that 27.5 percent of its working population is unemployed, at least another 20 percent of people are estimated to be engaged in the so- called grey economy. An average monthly salary in Bosnia and Herzegovina is 300 euros (about $350), with one in five citizens living below the poverty line. Protests The protests mark the largest outbreak of public anger over high unemployment and two decades of political inertia in the Balkan country of 3.8 million people since the end of the 1992‚Äì95 war. Tuzla ;4‚Äì5 February Protests began on 4 February 2014, peacefully, in the city of Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina, but turned violent the following day when hundreds of demonstrators, mostly former employees of several big companies, such as Dita, Polihem, Guming and Konjuh, clashed with police near the Tuzla local government building demanding compensation and calling on Tuzla officials to intervene instantly. Demonstrators blame local officials for allowing several state firms to collapse between 2000 and 2008 after being privatized, leaving many unemployed. The protests later spread to various cities across Bosnia and Herzegovina, including Bihaƒá, Mostar, Zenica, Kakanj and the capital Sarajevo. Due to the recent closures of factories and firms in Tuzla, at least 600 protesters tried to storm the building of the Tuzla local government, accusing authorities of turning a blind eye to the collapse of a number of state firms after their privatization. Some of the protesters threw eggs, flares and stones at the windows of the building and set tires on fire, blocking traffic in the city center. Police eventually forced demonstrators back and cordoned off the building. One of the hundreds of protesters in the city said: \\"This is the start of the Bosnian Spring,\\" alluding to the ongoing Arab Spring which began in 2010. The protesters gathered in front of the cantonal government building, requesting compensation and repayments of healthcare and pension payments after the privatized companies for which they worked failed. Local media reports said that some protesters scuffled with police after breaking into the cantonal government building, while others set garbage containers and tires on fire. It was reported that, by the end of the day, a total of twenty- two people, including 17 police officers, had been injured, while 24 were arrested for their involvement in the protests. As a result of the police brutality the day before, protesters were outraged. The next day, the number of protesters grew enormously; around 6,000 individuals gathered in front of the cantonal government building. The number of injured individuals also rose enormously. According to local newspapers, around 100 policemen were injured, with most of the injuries due to being hit by stones. 11 cars were destroyed and 27 protesters were arrested. Around 20 civilians sustained minor injuries. ;6 February On Thursday, 6 February, the protests spread into multiple cities in the country, at first by people who wanted to show solidarity with the citizens of Tuzla. In the capital city, Sarajevo, protesters clashed with police who had blocked traffic in the city center. Four officers were hospitalized. Over 200 people blocked traffic in Mostar and about 150 Zenica citizens protested in front of their local government building. One of the protestors in Zenica was quoted: \\"Today we fought for Tuzla, tomorrow we fight for all of us.\\" Protests also broke out in Bihaƒá and Te≈°anj, among others. 27 people who had been arrested the day before were released. That day also marked the first time since the start of the uprising that police used tear gas on the crowds. More than two dozen people were hospitalized with tear-gas- related injuries. Schools throughout Tuzla were closed and residents of buildings yelled insults and threw buckets of water at the officers who passed-by in full riot gear. Elderly neighbors banged on their windows and balconies. ;7 February On 7 February, mass crowds began to gather at the same place and in over 20 major cities across the country. People gathered in their city centers to support the protests in Tuzla. According to the official statements, more than 130 people, including 104 police officers, were injured on the third day of anti-government demonstrations in Tuzla alone. After a long day of waiting, 10,000 outraged protesters broke through the last line of police defense around the cantonal government building. Around 100 younger protesters stormed into the building, throwing furniture and papers out of the windows and burning the building afterwards. Even quick intervention by local fire crews could not prevent the fire from spreading to other floors. The protesters gave them a \\"calm hour,\\" after which the protests continued in front of the cantonal court. Protesters asked workers of the cantonal court to address them about their plans in freeing the remaining protesters arrested that day and the day before, which included the leader and organizer of the demonstrations. Shortly thereafter, a rain of stones started hitting the cantonal court. The group of 10,000 people started moving towards the municipal building, where all workers were evacuated before the angry mob arrived. The attack on the municipal building included a few short fights between the protesters and the special police units. It included the use of tear gas, which outraged the protesters even more. After the police fell back, protesters started throwing bricks and stones at the building, breaking windows that way. Shortly after burning the municipal building, it was announced that the police forces had switched sides and joined the protesters. During the unrest on Friday, 7 February, the mayor of Brƒçko was taken hostage by the crowd for a short while and then released. In the afternoon, a unit of special police of the Tuzla canton, under commanding officer D≈æevad Korman, lowered their shields and took off their helmets, which caused a wave of enthusiasm from the crowd, the members of which then approached and shook hands with the special forces members. Both the regular and the judicial police followed suit in front of the court and the prosecution buildings. ;8 February By 8 February, the riots had stopped and all the people had resumed peaceful protests and began clearing the streets of garbage and debris. Zenica Protests in Zenica on 7 February 2014. On 7 February, protestors in Zenica forced their way through a police cordon and set fire to a local government building and surrounding cars. The entire government of Zenica- Doboj Canton announced that they would resign during their next meeting. On 9 February, late in the night, the government of the Zenica-Doboj Canton analyzed the situation. On 10 February, protesters gathered again in front of the Cantonal building demanding immediate changes in social politics. Protest representatives held a meeting with the government officials to present their demands. During the protests, the main city boulevard was blocked for traffic. Sarajevo ;7 February Burning cars near Presidency palace, 7 February 2014 Tear gas and smoke blanketed downtown Sarajevo, where police opened fire with rubber bullets on several thousand protesters who set fire to the headquarters of the capital's cantonal government. Water cannon was also used to disperse protesters who were trying to enter the presidency building. Dense smoke was caused by the burning of several police cars near the Building of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was also heavily damaged when the demonstrators set fire to sections of the State Archives of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is located there. Demonstrators also torched and stoned the building of the Centar Municipality, Sarajevo, as well as the seat of the regional government of the Sarajevo Canton. ;8‚Äì9 February Peaceful protests with at least 200 people continued at 16:00 on 8 February, protesters demanding release of some young people from prisons that were involved in violent riots days earlier. The protesters called for peaceful protests to continue and demand the change of current government. Spokesperson for the municipal court of Sarajevo, Alem Hamziƒá, stated that 33 protesters have been released‚Äîadding, \\"Criminal proceedings will be launched against some ten demonstrators with court likely imposing prohibitive measures. Prohibitive measures include: ban on meeting and communicating, confiscation of passports and identity documents, and they will need to report twice weekly to the relevant police department.\\" Peaceful demonstrations continued throughout the day of 9 February. ;10 February Some time after 10 o'clock in the evening, an explosion in Skenderija shocked the Sarajevo metropolitan area; reports are that there are no casualties. Bihaƒá Protests began in Bihaƒá as early as 6 February. On 8 February, over 3,000 disgruntled citizens rallied at the Town Square to express dissatisfaction with the government of the Una-Sana Canton, one of Bosnia and Herzegovina's ten post-war cantons, demanding the resignation of the canton's Prime Minister Hamdija Lipovaƒça and the Minister of the Police. In front of the local government building, protesters from all over the country were met by police. Protesters shouted \\"Thieves!\\" and \\"We want resignation!\\" and asked the police to side with them. Police officers confiscated a number of Molotov cocktails. Shops in the city center closed down as a precautionary measure. Hundreds of protesters gathered around Prime Minister Lipovaƒça's home, fighting against the police and demanding resignation. The clash with police injured several people and the crowd later dispersed. On 10 February 2014, after days of protests that involved at least 3,000 people, the Prime Minister of the Una-Sana Canton Hamdija Lipovaƒça officially resigned. UDAR in May On 5 May the anti- governmentwww.udarr.com/Anti government protests organization under the name of \\"UDAR\\", which was already involved in the unrest, announced new protests on 9 May in Sarajevo. The protesters have planned to march from all cities and towns in Bosnia, primarily Tuzla, Zenica and Mostar, as well as other towns. However, any events announced earlier never occurred.http://www.udarr.com/May 9 Protest announced http://www.udarr.com/7 to 9 May march to Sarajevo http://www.udarr.com/Official website of the organization Neighboring countries Protests were held on 12 February in Belgrade, Serbia, and on 13 February in Zagreb, Croatia, in support of the ongoing political struggle in Bosnia. Two women were reported to have been detained by the police in Zagreb. There were reports of anti-government protests coming from neighbouring Montenegro and also Kosovo.

Damages ;Monetary The estimated cost in all the cities across the country has been estimated by the Klix portal [8 February, during the riots] to be around 50 million KM (‚âà ‚Ç¨25 million). ;Cultural Large amounts of historical documents were destroyed when sections of the Archives of Bosnia and Herzegovina, housed in the presidential building, were set on fire. Among the lost archival material were documents and gifts from the Ottoman period, original documents from the 1878‚Äì1918 Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as documentations of the interwar period, the 1941‚Äì1945 rule of the Independent State of Croatia, papers from the following years, and about 15,000 files from the 1996‚Äì2003 Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the repositories that were burnt, about 60 percent of the material was lost, according to estimates by ≈†aban Zahiroviƒá, the head of the Archives. Zahiroviƒá also mentioned issues with water damage from the firefighting, but said that it could be dealt with. Further, he wanted to clarify that there are four different buildings that store material for the Archives, but \\"those who claimed that 99.9% of the material was saved were uninformed and wrong.\\" Numerous organizations and foreign archives have offered to help with the restoration, and the Turkish agency TIKA has taken an initiative to assist with the preservation of the remaining documents. Seven of the rioters in Sarajevo were suspected of having started the fire; two (Salem Hatiboviƒá and Nihad Trnka) were arrested. On 4 April 2014, both were released (although still under suspicion of terrorism), on conditions that they don't leave their places of residence and abstain from having any contact with each other. Both were also mandated to report to the police once every week. Consequences ;Economic Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems is believed to have stopped investment into Tuzla Thermal Power Plant, due to city riots and political situation thereafter.http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/japanci-odustali-od-ulaganja-u- te-tuzla/741570.aspxhttp://www.dnevno.ba/vijesti/rijeci-strucnjaka-ako-kinezi- budu-gradili-blok-7-gradani-u-fbih-placat-ce-struju-skuplju-za-30-posto-60979 Reactions=Domestic *‚ÄîOn 7 February 2014, the Federation Prime Minister Nermin Nik≈°iƒá held a press conference, with prosecutors, and accused hooligans of creating chaos. Bakir Izetbegoviƒá, one of the country's three presidents and leader of the Party of Democratic Action said, \\"I believe that people want a change of power. I believe that within three months we should offer citizens a chance to choose who they trust, because it's obvious that this isn't working anymore.\\" Bosnian minister Zlatko Lagumd≈æija said, \\"Now, it is time for citizens to talk and for politicians to listen in silence. We should create a dialogue environment in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\\" *‚ÄîPresident Milorad Dodik has expressed that he is \\"proud of the citizens in Republika Srpska\\" for not falling for provocations that could make the unrests in the Federation entity of BiH spread further. He has also expressed suspicions that there might be an underlying political project that intends to somehow make the recent unrests expand into Republika Srpska entity of BiH. Supranational *‚ÄîSpokesman for the European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy ≈†tefan F√ºle called for protesters and police to avoid resorting to violence. High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton called for Bosnian politicians to show leadership, stating, \\"The leadership (needs to be) aware of issues raised by people and the opportunity that it needs to take to resolve not just the economic issues of concern, but also the political situation. It's time (Bosnian political leaders) started to really show that leadership.\\" On 18 February, F√ºle, disappointed with the results of talks with the leaders of seven most influential political parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina, decided to end his pursuit in trying to make a deal to put the Sejdiƒá‚ÄìFinci verdict into effect. \\"It is time for the Bosnia and Herzegovina's institutions to take matters into their own hands and solve the issue. The implementation of the verdict is the key of Bosnia and Herzegovina's advancement to EU membership, but also the protection of the rights of its citizens,\\" F√ºle said. International *‚ÄîHigh Representative for Bosnia, Austrian Valentin Inzko, said that Austria will increase its number of troops in Bosnia, and if the situation worsens, he will bring in more EU troops. *‚ÄîCroatia has called for an immediate cessation of violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatian ministry of Foreign and European Affairs stated: 'We are worriedly monitoring the development of events in Bosnia and Herzegovina and calling for urgent cessation of conflicts and violence. We call for all parties to establish a mutual communication because European, stable and prosperous Bosnia and Herzegovina is in the interest of all its citizens. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a perspective of being an EU member state and should resolve its conflicts in the spirit of one.' :Croatian president Ivo Josipoviƒá commented on the riots while away at the Winter Olympics in Sochi. \\"I wish for our neighbours and friends to have the current situation [in the country] calm down as soon as possible. It's paramount that all of the social problems be solved within the democratic institutions and I hope that will be the case with Bosnia and Herzegovina, too,\\" president Josipoviƒá said. :Croatian Foreign and European affairs minister Vesna Pusiƒá said that \\"Bosnia and Herzegovina has, unlike some other difficult cases at this moment, a guaranteed European perspective; it has a confirmed path in front of it towards European integrates. I think that, even with all of the hardships, it is something which has a wide support as a direction of development for Bosnia and Herzegovina among its citizens, and thus I think it would be necessary to find a method of communication as soon as possible.\\" She added she would be speaking about the situation on 10 February, in Brussels at the foreign affairs ministers' meeting. On 10 February, Pusiƒá suggested to open the \\"prenegotiations\\" with Bosnia and Herzegovina to have them join the EU but there is no indication that the consensus has been reached on the matter. The European Commission stated that the implementing of the Sejdiƒá‚ÄìFinci verdict as the immovable condition of the Bosnia and Herzegovina's path towards the EU is \\"not the most productive of the ideas.\\" However, they stated that the implementation of the verdict is very important for progress. On the other hand, in the European parliament, Jelko Kacin, Slovenian MEP openly opposed Pusiƒá's suggestion in front of the EU high representative Catherine Ashton, saying he is \\"against allowing Bosnia and Herzegovina a fast track towards the EU, because it would suit the political elite of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the very act which led its citizens to the edge of the abyss. Furthermore, the Sejdiƒá‚ÄìFinci verdict is about human rights, and your country, Croatia, knows all too well it's not possible to skip over steps towards the EU when we're talking about human rights.\\" Kacin also commented it's hard to speak of opening the negotiations when Bosnia and Herzegovina's politicians can't decide whether or not to export milk, since one of the entities refuses to make the veterinary service state-level. \\"The matter could be resolved in a blink of an eye, but they cannot agree. And if they can't solve even that, how can we even talk about fast tracking?,\\" Kacin said. Upon being asked a question if the EU is thinking about abolishing the Republika Srpska, Pusiƒá said for the press that that isn't the way EU works. \\"EU is not an officer nor someone who can impose the inner arrangement of the country but it can create the conditions which attract people to the country. Not as a police officer, but through a soft power,\\" said Pusiƒá, adding she would be giving the details of the Bosnia and Herzegovina EU negotiation start plan to the diplomats in the EU institutions and afterwards to the public. :European Parliament member Davor Ivo Stier from the Croatian Democratic Union also commented on the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. \\"When people who set things on fire in Mostar are yelling 'This is Bosnia!,' it incredibly reminds me of the Chetniks during the aggression against Croatia yelling 'This is Serbia.'. When Zlatko Lagumd≈æija accuses the European parliament because of a resolution which condemns centralism, it is clear just how much the centralist elites are against the European peace project. Croatia and the EU cannot be passive towards this downward spiral of violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is time to show leadership. End to centralism! End to violence! It's time for a European path of Bosnia and Herzegovina!,\\" he commented the riots in Bosnia and Herzegovina on his Facebook profile. :Prime minister Zoran Milanoviƒá visited Mostar, which was criticised in the capital Sarajevo, due to the expectations of the Croatian prime minister first visiting the capital city. In an interview with Veƒçernji list, Minister of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina Fahrudin Radonƒçiƒá said he would prefer if Milanoviƒá visited Sarajevo first but believed he had his best intentions in mind. :Robert Bubalo, Veƒçernji lists columnist, wrote how it is peculiar that nobody protested the arrival of Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoƒülu, since \\"his own government forcefully repressed protests with violence and bloodshed last year, his government which is corrupt and which hunts down intellectuals such as Orhan Pamuk. No one to even ask him what Erdoƒüan meant by saying 'Sarajevo is ours and Anatolia yours.' Imagine the reactions in Sarajevo if a celebrity, even a singer, said 'Mostar is ours, Lika is yours.'\\" He concluded by saying Milanoviƒá would be of greater help to Bosnia and Herzegovina as a prime minister of an EU member state, unlike the Turkish Foreign Minister. *‚ÄîChristian Schwarz-Schilling who was the high representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina and observed the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords that ended the Bosnian War on 14 December 1995, has said, \\"The politics that they have practiced must be stopped immediately. The privileges they [politicians] have enjoyed for too long from old times now must be curtailed. But this would necessitate involvement from the international community. And I don't see that coming. It's just like with Ukraine. There, the international community woke up only after a critical situation arose. The same thing will happen in Bosnia.\\" *‚ÄîDeputy Prime Minister of Luxembourg Jean Asselborn dramatized the current situation further by stating, \\"We support all those who want stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The citizens have spoken. Bosnia is the biggest problem that European Union has in the Balkan region. We must defend the principle that Bosnia is one nation and never to be partitioned into three or four entities. I hope there are enough of those people in the European Union and Bosnia itself who want Bosnia to take the right path.\\" *‚ÄîSerbia's Deputy Prime Minister and current President Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá said, \\"There is no need to solve political problems by setting buildings on fire, using violence and beating up police. Serbia wants stability in the region, and thinks that is of essential importance.\\" *‚ÄîTurkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoƒülu made his appeal during a visit to Sarajevo, stating, \\"Today is the day to act in Bosnia and we must not wait any longer. Bosnia urgently needs international aid in the form of a new package of political and economic reforms. The Dayton peace agreement was of outmost importance for it helped end the war but it now hampers the functioning of the country.\\" *‚ÄîThe US Embassy in Sarajevo issued a statement stating politicians should listen to the protesters and authorities should end the violence. \\"The use of violence distracts attention from the fundamental message we see the vast majority of protesters trying to make‚Äîthat reform is necessary now,\\" the statement said. *‚ÄîBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague demands stagnation in Bosnian politics and government to come to an end, stating, \\"What happened in Bosnia is a wake-up call. We need to focus more efforts on helping Bosnia towards the EU, towards NATO membership, so that the stagnation in Bosnian politics and government can come to an end, and I think it's probably going to become a more important issue over the coming months.\\" Gallery File:Municipality building in Zenica after 2014 Bosnian social riots.jpgMunicipality building in Zenica after the Bosnian social riots File:Municipality Zenica building the day after the riot in February 2014.jpgMunicipality Zenica building the day after the riot in February 2014 File:Tuzla riots.jpgView at the Government Building of Tuzla Canton day after it was burned down; date: 8 February 2014 File:Zenica-Doboj Canton building the day after the riot in February 2014.jpgZenica-Doboj Canton building the day after the riot in February 2014 File:Sarajevo Kanton building, June 2014.JPGThe building of Kanton Sarajevo in June 2014, still bearing the marks of the February riots File:Sarajevo Kanton building, June 2014 (window).JPGThe building of Kanton Sarajevo in June 2014, still bearing the marks of the February riots File:Sarajevo Kanton building, June 2014 (corner).JPGThe building of Kanton Sarajevo in June 2014, still bearing the marks of the February riots See also *Economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina *History of Bosnia and Herzegovina *Cazin uprising *Husino uprising *Spring Revolutions (disambiguation) *List of protests in the 21st century ReferencesExternal links *Official website of the main anti- government organization (archive) Category:Protests in Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Riots and civil disorder in Bosnia and Herzegovina Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:2014 in Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:2014 protests Category:Rebellions in Bosnia and Herzegovina ","title":"2014 unrest in Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"id":"41872522","title":"List of members of the L√∏gting, 1988‚Äì1990"},{"id":"41872528","text":"East Lincoln is an unincorporated community located in Lincoln County, Mississippi.

It was used as Richmond's first public library from 1925 until 1930, was used as part of a school, and was the main administrative building on the Monroe Park, Virginia campus of VCU for more than 40 years.History by Ray Bonis Office of the Provost, VCU It is now used as administrative offices. The home was built from 1888-1892 for Ginter, a cigarette magnate and philanthropist who developed an area of Richmond's north side and built the Jefferson Hotel (Richmond, Virginia). Harvey L. Page and William Winthrop Kent were brought in from Washington, D.C. to design the home. It is three and one half stories high and includes a polygonal three- story tower. It uses brownstone at its base, pecked brownstone on the first floor, patterned brick, and stone panels. The roof employed Spanish tile. The home has a mahogany library and ironwork done by G. Krug and Sons. Ginter never married and lived in the home with John Pope, his younger business associate and long-time friend, and his niece Grace Arents. When he died on October 2, 1897 the home and his fortune were left to Arents (1848-1926). Richmond Public Library and Richmond School of Social Work and Public Health In 1924, Ginter House became the first site for the newly founded Richmond Public Library. The home's library was used by students of the Richmond School of Social Work and Public Health which was established across the street in 1925 (now Founder's Hall). When the new Richmond library (aka Dooley Library) was opened in 1930, its books were moved to the new location and the Richmond School of Social Work and Public Health purchased Ginter House and property in 1930. It was used for its library, as classroom space and offices. It later became used only for administrative functions. The school became Richmond Professional Institute (RPI). It merged in 1968 with the Medical College of Virginia to become Virginia Commonwealth University.

An example of Richardsonian architecture, it is located on the corner of Shafer Street and West Franklin Street at 901 West Franklin Street. The home features decorative woodwork, ornate fireplaces, stained glass windows, leather wallpaper and wrought iron detailing.Ginter House VCU Summer Residence In the late 19th century, Ginter built a large luxurious, Victorian-style Mansion in Richmond's North Side for his summer home where he lived with John Pope. Westbrook had a tower, the top floor of which was used by the Major as a private barbershop. The home was filled with dark wood paneling in oak, birch, mahogany and cherry. Fireplaces were constructed with imported tile in various designs and colors. It became a psychiatric hospital in 1911. The house was demolished in 1975.

It is marketed by Novo Nordisk. It was approved in the United States, the European Union, and Japan in 2013. Text was copied from this source which is ¬© European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. Medical uses Turoctocog alfa is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in adults and children with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). Turoctocog alfa pegol is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in adulta and children twelve years and above with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). In the safety and efficacy trial for prevention and treatment of bleeds, in hemophilia patients the success rate for treatment of bleeds was 84.5% (excluding bleeds for which there was no outcome reported) and out of a total of nine surgeries in nine patients performed during the trial, haemostasis was successful in all the surgeries and no treatment failures were reported. It is also used for perioperative management and routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes. Turoctocog alfa is not indicated for the treatment of von Willebrand disease. Benefits and risks In a study conducted with 150 patients aged twelve and above, adolescents after using turoctocog alfa as a treatment, had an average of 5.55 bleedings per year while the adults had an average of 6.68 bleeding per year. According to data, turoctocog alfa was considered an 'excellent' treatment for 403 out of 499 bleeding episodes. In another study involving 63 patients aged less than twelve years, children had an average of 5.33 bleedings per year after using turoctocog alfa as hemophilia treatment. In this study too turoctocog alfa was considered as an 'excellent' treatment for 116 out of 126 bleeding episodes. Alongside the benefits, a few of the common turoctocog alfa adverse effects would be injection site reaction, pyrexia and augmented liver enzyme levels. Rare cases of allergic reactions have been reported as well. There is a possibility of patients developing hypersensitivity to the drug since it contains traces of hamster proteins. Activity-neutralising antibodies may be developed whereby expected plasma factor VIII activity levels may not be achieved and thus the bleeding would not be controlled as needed. Preparation As cell culture, Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) are used in order to acquire proper processing of factor VIII protein, that has demonstrated good efficacy in thrombin generation and clot formation in preclinical evaluations in murine (mouse) and canine (dog) models of hemophilia A and in patient-derived whole blood. Difference between NovoSeven and NovoEight Even though both treatments are plasma-derived and recombinant analogues of blood clotting factors, NovoSeven is developed as a congenital FVIIa analogue for hemophilia A and B patients while NovoEight (turoctocog alfa) is for congenital FVIII deficiency. NovoSeven is called a bypassing agent because it skips the need for factor VIII or IX in people with inhibitors and activates factor X directly. Turoctocog alfa pegol In February 2019, the FDA approved antihemophilic factor (recombinant), glycopegylated-exei (turoctocog alfa pegol) (Esperoct) for the treatment of hemophilia A. Turoctocog alfa pegol was approved for medical use in the European Union in June 2019.

The film stars Viola Davis and Jennifer Lopez. It premiered on January 30, 2015, at the Sundance Film Festival. The film was released in North America on July 17, 2015, in a limited release and through video on demand by Samuel Goldwyn Films. This marks the second time Davis and Lopez acted in a film together, the first being the Steven Soderbergh film Out of Sight in 1998.  Plot  Lila, a single mother living in Atlanta, struggles after the murder of her son Stephon in a drive-by shooting. Faced with indifference from the police force and barely able to take care of herself and her younger son Justin, Lila joins a support group for mothers of murdered children. There, she meets Eve, whose daughter died. Eve sits off to the side without participating. Eve seems less interested in moving on with her life than in seeking revenge. Lila chooses Eve to be her sponsor, and one night, while engaging in therapeutic home redecorating, they find a gun in Justin's book bag. This discovery horrifies Lila but inspires Eve to suggest they investigate Stephon's murder themselves. The two women find someone with the information they seek. When he pulls a gun on them, Eve shoots him dead, and they flee. When it seems as if they have gotten away with the shooting, the two women move up the underworld chain of command to discover who ordered the drive-by. With the death of the drug dealer, Alonzo Troys, who actually pulled the trigger, they come to the attention of Ojeda, the hired gun of the kingpin of the criminal organization. As the bodies begin piling up, Lila becomes increasingly unsure of the morality of their actions, while Eve becomes bolder and more daring. Finally, a rift develops between the two women and Eve suddenly disappears. Around this time, their actions pique the interest of Detective Holliston, the cop assigned to Lila's case. It appears to be only a matter of time before he puts two and two together and figures out who is behind the killings. Lila and Justin are on the way to school one morning when, while sitting at a stop sign, a van containing armed men drives up beside them. Before the men can shoot, Lila pulls out into traffic and is involved in a car accident. This saves their lives when witnesses aid, stopping the gunmen from finishing them off. After Lila gets out of the hospital, she and Eve make up. They rig Lila's house with explosives and set up a trap to lure local criminal kingpin, Miguel Alejandro, and his henchmen to come after her by shooting at his home. After he threatens to kill her, and she drops off Eve, Lila visits Ben, her neighbour. When he questions her about Eve, she shows him pictures from her phone, only to be confused when Eve appears in none of them. During the course of the night, Lila realizes that Eve is a figment of her imagination. Lila has done everything herself and is responsible for all the drug dealers' murders. In a late night conversation in the street, \\"Eve\\" talks her into finishing the job so she can move on and keep Justin safe. Ojeda poses as a cable installer and breaks into Lila's house. Finding it empty, he invites Alejandro to wait for her arrival at the house. Lila watches them via a laptop's webcam at Ben's house. When Alejandro and another henchman arrive, Lila asks Ben to take care of Justin while she takes care of things at home. Lila walks across the street with Eve and lights a fuse at Eve's urging. When Eve tells her that she cannot stop it, Lila throws herself into the blast. Lila is blown onto the front yard, and the house burns as Ben arrives to take care of her. Detective Holliston fails to convince his partner, Detective Skaketti, that Lila is responsible. Undeterred, Holliston approaches Lila at a support meeting once she is released from the hospital. When Holliston threatens to take in Ben and Justin if she does not cooperate, the other mothers, who have collected donations to assist Lila, stop her from confessing and volunteer alibis. Holliston recognizes that grieving mothers are a strong alibi and leaves. Ben says goodbye to Justin and Lila as they leave Atlanta for a new life elsewhere. As she is driving down the road, Justin asks his mother if she is okay, and she replies that she will be.

Ethnically Jewish, she was arrested at a Netherlands convent and gassed at Auschwitz, following a protest by Dutch bishops against the abduction of Jews. Several Catholic countries and populations fell under Nazi domination during the period of the Second World War (1939‚Äì1945), and ordinary Catholics fought on both sides of the conflict. Despite efforts to protect its rights within Germany under a 1933 Reichskonkordat treaty, the Church in Germany had faced persecution in the years since Adolf Hitler had seized power, and Pope Pius XI accused the Nazi government of sowing 'fundamental hostility to Christ and his Church'. The concordat has been described by some as giving moral legitimacy to the Nazi regime soon after Hitler had acquired quasi-dictatorial powers through the Enabling Act of 1933, an Act itself facilitated through the support of the Catholic Centre Party. Pius XII became Pope on the eve of war and lobbied world leaders to prevent the outbreak of conflict. His first encyclical, Summi Pontificatus, called the invasion of Poland an \\"hour of darkness\\". He affirmed the policy of Vatican neutrality, but maintained links to the German Resistance. Despite being the only world leader to publicly and specifically denounce Nazi crimes against Jews in his 1942 Christmas Address, controversy surrounding his apparent reluctance to speak frequently and in even more explicit terms about Nazi crimes continues.Ventresca, 2013, p. 207 He used diplomacy to aid war victims, lobbied for peace, shared intelligence with the Allies, and employed Vatican Radio and other media to speak out against atrocities like race murders. In Mystici corporis Christi (1943) he denounced the murder of the handicapped. A denunciation from German bishops of the murder of the \\"innocent and defenceless\\", including \\"people of a foreign race or descent\\", followed.Evans, 2008, pp. 529‚Äì30 Hitler's invasion of Catholic Poland sparked the War. Nazi policy towards the Church was at its most severe in the areas it annexed to the Reich, such as the Czech and Slovene lands, Austria and Poland. In Polish territories it annexed to Greater Germany, the Nazis set about systematically dismantling the Church‚Äîarresting its leaders, exiling its clergymen, closing its churches, monasteries and convents. Many clergymen were murdered. Over 1800 Catholic Polish clergy died in concentration camps; most notably, Saint Maximilian Kolbe. Nazi security chief Reinhard Heydrich soon orchestrated an intensification of restrictions on church activities in Germany. Hitler and his ideologues Goebbels, Himmler, Rosenberg and Bormann hoped to de-Christianize Germany in the long term.\\\\- Sharkey, Word for Word/The Case Against the Nazis; How Hitler's Forces Planned To Destroy German Christianity, New York Times, 13 January 2002 \\\\- Griffin, Roger Fascism's relation to religion in Blamires, Cyprian, World fascism: a historical encyclopedia, Volume 1, p. 10, ABC-CLIO, 2006: \\"There is no doubt that in the long run Nazi leaders such as Hitler and Himmler intended to eradicate Christianity just as ruthlessly as any other rival ideology, even if in the short term they had to be content to make compromises with it.\\" \\\\- Mosse, George Lachmann, Nazi culture: intellectual, cultural and social life in the Third Reich, p. 240, University of Wisconsin Press, 2003: \\"Had the Nazis won the war their ecclesiastical policies would have gone beyond those of the German Christians, to the utter destruction of both the Protestant and the Catholic Church.\\" \\\\- Shirer, William L., Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany, p. 240, Simon and Schuster, 1990: \\"the Nazi regime intended eventually to destroy Christianity in Germany, if it could, and substitute the old paganism of the early tribal Germanic gods and the new paganism of the Nazi extremists.\\" \\\\- Fischel, Jack R., Historical Dictionary of the Holocaust , p. 123, Scarecrow Press, 2010: \\"The objective was to either destroy Christianity and restore the German gods of antiquity or to turn Jesus into an Aryan.\\" \\\\- Dill, Marshall, Germany: a modern history , p. 365, University of Michigan Press, 1970: \\"It seems no exaggeration to insist that the greatest challenge the Nazis had to face was their effort to eradicate Christianity in Germany or at least to subjugate it to their general world outlook.\\" \\\\- Wheaton, Eliot Barculo The Nazi revolution, 1933‚Äì1935: prelude to calamity:with a background survey of the Weimar era, p. 290, 363, Doubleday 1968: The Nazis sought \\"to eradicate Christianity in Germany root and branch.\\"Bendersky, Joseph W., A concise history of Nazi Germany, p. 147, Rowman & Littlefield, 2007: \\"Consequently, it was Hitler's long range goal to eliminate the churches once he had consolidated control over his European empire.\\" With the expansion of the war in the East, expropriation of monasteries, convents and church properties surged from 1941. Clergy were persecuted and sent to concentration camps, religious Orders had their properties seized, some youth were sterilized. The first priest to die was Aloysius Zuzek.Vincent A. Lapomarda; The Jesuits and the Third Reich; 2nd Edn, Edwin Mellen Press; 2005; pp 232, 233 Bishop August von Galen's ensuing 1941 denunciation of Nazi euthanasia and defence of human rights roused rare popular dissent. The German bishops denounced Nazi policy towards the church in pastoral letters, calling it \\"unjust oppression\\".Fest, 1997, p. 377The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942; pp. 74‚Äì80. From 1940, the Nazis gathered priest- dissidents in dedicated clergy barracks at Dachau, where (95%) of its 2,720 inmates were Catholic (mostly Poles, and 411 Germans), 1,034 died there. Mary Fulbrook wrote that when politics encroached on the church, German Catholics were prepared to resist, but the record was otherwise patchy and uneven with notable exceptions, \\"it seems that, for many Germans, adherence to the Christian faith proved compatible with at least passive acquiescence in, if not active support for, the Nazi dictatorship\\".Fulbrook, 1991, pp. 80‚Äì81 Influential members of the German Resistance included Jesuits of the Kreisau Circle and laymen such as July plotters Klaus von Stauffenberg, Jakob Kaiser and Bernhard Letterhaus, whose faith inspired resistance.The German Resistance to Hitler p. 225 Elsewhere, vigorous resistance from bishops such as Johannes de Jong and Jules-G√©raud Sali√®ge, papal diplomats such as Angelo Rotta, and nuns such as Margit Slachta, can be contrasted with the apathy of others and the outright collaboration of Catholic politicians such as Slovakia's Msgr Jozef Tiso and fanatical Croat nationalists. From within the Vatican, Msgr Hugh O'Flaherty coordinated the rescue of thousands of Allied POWs, and civilians, including Jews. While Nazi antisemitism embraced modern pseudo- scientific racial principles rejected by the Catholic Church, ancient antipathies between Christianity and Judaism contributed to European antisemitism; during the Second World War the Catholic Church rescued many thousands of Jews by issuing false documents, lobbying Axis officials, hiding them in monasteries, convents, schools and elsewhere; including the Vatican and Castel Gandolfo. Holocaust By 1941, most Christians in Europe were living under Nazi rule. Generally, the life of their churches could continue, provided they did not attempt to participate in politics. When the Nazi regime undertook the industrialized mass-extermination of the Jews, the Nazis found a great many willing participants.Blainey, 2011, pp. 499‚Äì502 Scholars have undertaken critical examinations of the origins of Nazi antisemitism and while the feelings of European Catholics toward Jews varied considerably, antisemitism was \\"prevalent throughout Europe\\".Phayer, 2000, pp. 1, xii, xiii As Geoffrey Blainey wrote, \\"Christianity could not escape some indirect blame for Holocaust. The Jews and Christians were rivals, sometimes enemies, for a long period of history. Furthermore, it was traditional for Christians to blame Jewish leaders for the crucifixion of Christ... At the same time, Christians showed devotion and respect. They were conscious of their debt to the Jews. Jesus and all the disciples and all the authors of the gospels were of the Jewish race. Christians viewed the Old Testament, the holy book of the synagogues, as equally a holy book for them...\\". Others too have come under scrutiny, wrote Blainey: \\"even Jews living in the United States, might have indirectly and directly given more help, or publicity, to the Jews during their plight in Hitler's Europe\\". Hamerow writes that sympathy for the Jews was common among Catholic churchmen in the Resistance, who saw both Catholics and Jews as religious minorities exposed to bigotry on the part of the majority. This sympathy led some lay and clergy resistors to speak publicly against the persecution of the Jews, as with the priest who wrote in a periodical in 1934 that it was a sacred task of the church to oppose \\"sinful racial pride and blind hatred of the Jews\\". The leadership of the Catholic Church in Germany, whoever, was generally hesitant to speak out specifically on behalf of the Jews.Hamerow, 1997, p. 74 While racists were rare among the Catholic hierarchy in Germany, the bishops feared protests against the anti- Jewish policies of the regime would invite retaliation against Catholics.Hamerow, 1997, p. 138 The considerable energies expended by the German church in opposing government interference in the churches was not matched in public by protests against the anti-Jewish policies of regime. Such protests as were made tended to be private letters to government ministers.Ian Kershaw; The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation; 4th Ed; Oxford University Press; New York; 2000\\"; pp. 210‚Äì11  German Catholics and the Holocaust  Nazi persecution of the Jews grew steadily worse throughout era of the Third Reich. Hamerow wrote that during the prelude to the Holocaust between Kristallnacht in November 1938 and the 1941 invasion of Soviet Russia, the position of the Jews \\"deteriorated steadily from disenfranchisement to segregation, ghettoization and sporadic mass murder\\".Hamerow, 1997, p. 294 The Vatican responded to the Kristallnacht by seeking to find places of refuge for Jews. Pius XII instructed local bishops to help all those in need at the outbreak of the war.Pius XII and the Holocaust; by Jonathan Gorsky; published by Yad Vashem; retrieved 10 September 2013 According to Kershaw, the \\"detestation of Nazism was overwhelming within the Catholic Church\\", yet traditional Christian anti-Judaism offered \\"no bulwark\\" against Nazi biological antisemitism,Ian Kershaw; The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation; 4th Edn; Oxford University Press; New York; 2000\\"; pp. 211‚Äì12 and there was no shortage of antisemitic rhetoric from the clergy: Bishop Buchberger of Regensburg called Nazi racism directed at Jews \\"justified self-defense\\" in the face of \\"overly powerful Jewish capital\\"; Bishop Hilfrich of Limburg said the true Christian religion \\"made its way not from the Jews but in spite of them.\\" Still, while clergymen like Cardinal Adolf Bertram favoured a policy of concessions to the Nazi regime, other, like Bishop Preysing of Berlin, called for more concerted opposition.Lewy, 1964, pp. xix‚Äìxx Bishop Konrad von Preysing of Berlin, in 1935. Of Germany's bishops, along with Joseph Frings, he was among the most public of German church leaders in his statements against genocide.Phayer, 2000, p. 77 When deportations for the Final Solution commenced, at his Cathedral in Berlin, Fr. Bernhard Lichtenberg offered public prayer and sermonised against the deportations of Jews to the East. He was denounced, and later died en route to Dachau. Nazi ideology saw Jewishness as a \\"racial question\\". Among the deported \\"Jews\\" of Germany were practicing Catholics. Martin Gilbert notes that at Christmas 1941, with deportations underway, the Polish ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto for \\"Jews\\", held Christian services, with the Catholic service conducted by Sister Maria Regina Fuhrmann, a theologian from Vienna. Two newly arrived Catholic priests of \\"Jewish origin\\" were among the deportees in attendance.Martin Gilbert; Kristallnacht - Prelude to Disaster; HarperPress; 2006; p. 250‚Äì251 Saint Edith Stein is among the most famous German Jewish-Catholics sent to the death camps by the Nazis. ;Faulhaber 1933 Cardinal Faulhaber gained an early reputation as an opponent of the regime denouncing the Nazi extremists who were calling for the Bible to be purged of the \\"Jewish\\" Old Testament, because, wrote Hamerow, in seeking to adhere to the central anti-Semitic tenets of Nazism, these \\"anti-Semitic zealots\\" were also undermining \\"the basis of Catholicism.\\"Hamerow, 1997, p. 140Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: Michael von Faulhaber; web Apr. 2013. Faulhaber delivered three important Advent sermons in 1933. Entitled Judaism, Christianity, and Germany, the sermons affirmed the Jewish origins of the Christian religion, the continuity of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible, and the importance of the Christian tradition to Germany. The pre-Christian \\"people of Israel were the bearers of the revelation\\" and their books were \\"building stones for God's kingdom\\". Unlike the Nazis, Faulhaber believed Judaism was a religious not a racial concept. In his private correspondence, his sympathy for the Jews of his own time is clear, but Faulhaber feared that going public with these thoughts would make the struggle against the Jews also a \\"struggle against the Catholics\\".Hamerow, 1997, p. 76 Faulhaber's sermons appeared to undermine the central racist tenet of Nazism, but were, in essence, a defence of the church. Similarly, when in 1933, the Nazi school superintendent of Munster issued a decree: religious instruction be combined with discussion of the \\"demoralising power\\" of the \\"people of Israel\\", Bishop von Galen refused, writing such interference in curriculum was a breach of the Concordat. He feared children would be confused as to their \\"obligation to act with charity to all men\\" and the historical mission of the people of Israel.Hamerow, 1997, p. 139 The language of Galen's later 1941 sermons on the \\"right to life, and inviolability\\" of all people, did not mention the Jews by name, but had far reaching resonance. He declared himself speaking to protect the \\"rights of the human personality\\", not the narrow denominational interests of the Catholic Church.Hamerow, 1997, pp. 289-90 ;Kristallnacht 1938 On 11 November 1938, following Kristallnacht, Pius XI joined Western leaders in condemning the pogrom. In response, the Nazis organised mass demonstrations against Catholics and Jews, in Munich. The Bavarian Gauleiter Adolf Wagner declared before 5,000 protesters: \\"Every utterance the Pope makes in Rome is an incitement of the Jews throughout the world to agitate against Germany\\". Cardinal Faulhaber supplied a truck to the rabbi of the Ohel Yaakov synagogue, to rescue sacred objects before the building was torn down on Kristallacht. A Nazi mob attacked his palace, and smashed its windows.Martin Gilbert; Kristallnacht - Prelude to Disaster; HarperPress; 2006; p.143 On 21 November, in an address to the world's Catholics, the Pope rejected the Nazi claim of racial superiority. He insisted there was only a single human race. Robert Ley, the Nazi Minister of Labour declared the following day in Vienna: \\"No compassion will be tolerated for the Jews. We deny the Pope's statement there is but one human race. The Jews are parasites.\\" Catholic leaders including Cardinal Schuster of Milan, Cardinal van Roey in Belgium and Cardinal Verdier in Paris backed the Pope's strong condemnation of Kristallnacht.Martin Gilbert; Kristallnacht - Prelude to Disaster; HarperPress; 2006; p.172 ;Fulda Bishops Conferences During the war, the Fulda Conference of Bishops met annually in Fulda.Phayer, 2000, p. 75 The issue of whether the bishops should speak out against the persecution of the Jews was debated at a 1942 meeting.Phayer, 2000, p. 74 The consensus was to \\"give up heroic action in favor of small successes\\". A draft letter proposed by Margarete Sommer was rejected, because it was viewed as a violation of the Reichskonkordat to speak out on issues not directly related to the church. Bishops von Preysing and Frings were the most public in their statements against genocide. Phayer asserts the German episcopate, as opposed to other bishops, could have done more to save Jews.Phayer, 2000, p. 67 Professor Robert Krieg argues the Church's model of itself \\"as a hierarchical institution intent on preserving itself so God's grace would be immediately available to its members\\" prevailed over other models, such as the model of mystical communion, or moral advocate.Robert A. Krieg, Catholic Theologians in Nazi Germany, p. viii According to Phayer, \\"had the German bishops confronted the Holocaust publicly and nationally, the possibilities of undermining Hitler's death apparatus might have existed. Admittedly, it is speculative to assert this, but it is certain that many more German Catholics would have sought to save Jews by hiding them if their church leaders had spoken out\\". In this regard, Phayer places the responsibility with the Vatican, asserting that \\"a strong papal assertion would have enabled the bishops to overcome their disinclinations\\" and that \\"Bishop Preysing's only hope to spur his colleagues into action lay in Pius XII\\". Yet, Some German bishops are praised for their wartime actions; according to Phayer, \\"several bishops did speak out\\". ;Preysing In 1935, Pius XI appointed Konrad von Preysing as Bishop of Berlin. Preysing assisted in drafting the anti-Nazi encyclical Mit Brennender Sorge. Together with Cologne's Archbishop, Josef Frings, sought to have the German Bishops conference speak out against the Nazi death camps. Preysing even infrequently attended meetings of the Kreisau Circle German resistance movement. Von Preysing was a noted critic of Nazism, but was protected from Nazi retaliation by his position. His cathedral administrator and confidant Bernhard Lichtenberg, was not. Lichtenberg was under the watch of the Gestapo by 1933, for his courageous support of prisoners and Jews.Bernhard Lichtenberg; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013 He ran Preysing's aid unit (the Hilfswerke beim Bisch√∂flichen Ordinariat Berlin) which secretly assisted those who were being persecuted by the regime. From 1938, Lichtenberg conducted prayers for the Jews and other inmates of the concentration camps, including \\"my fellow priests there\\". For preaching against Nazi propaganda and writing a letter of protest concerning Nazi euthanasia, he was arrested in 1941, sentenced to two years' penal servitude, and died en route to Dachau concentration camp in 1943. He was subsequently honoured by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations. ;Frings Josef Frings became Archbishop of Cologne in 1942. In his sermons, he repeatedly spoke in support of persecuted peoples and against state repression. In March 1944, Frings attacked arbitrary arrests, racial persecution and forced divorces. That autumn, he protested to the Gestapo against the deportations of Jews from Cologne and surrounds. Following war's end, Frings succeeded Bertram as chairman of the Fulda Bishops' Conference in July 1945. In 1946, he was appointed a cardinal by Pius XII.Josef Frings; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013 In 1943, the German bishops debated whether to directly confront Hitler collectively over what they knew of the murdering of Jews. Frings wrote a pastoral letter cautioning his diocese not to violate the inherent rights of others to life, even those \\"not of our blood\\"; during the war, he preached in a sermon, \\"no one may take the property or life of an innocent person just because he is a member of a foreign race\\".http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/education/courses/life_lessons/pdfs/lesson8_4.pdf ;Kaller In East Prussia, the Bishop of Ermland, Maximilian Kaller denounced Nazi eugenics and racism, pursued a policy of ethnic equality for his German, Polish and Lithuanian flock, and protected his Polish clergy and laypeople. Threatened by the Nazis, he applied for a transfer to be chaplain to a concentration camp. His request was denied by Cesare Orsenigo, a Papal Nuncio with some Fascist sympathies. ;Laity Among the laity, Gertrud Luckner was among the first to sense the genocidal inclinations of the Hitler regime and to take national action.Phayer, 2000, pp. 116‚Äì117 From 1938 she worked at the head office of \\"Caritas\\". She organized aid circles for Jews, assisted many to escape.Gertrud Luckner; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013 She personally investigated the fate of the Jews being transported to the East and managed to obtain information on prisoners in concentration camps. In 1935, Margarete Sommer took up a position at the Episcopal Diocesan Authority in Berlin, counseling victims of racial persecution for Caritas Emergency Relief. In 1941 she became director of the Welfare Office of the Berlin Diocesan Authority, under Bernhard Lichtenberg.Margarete Sommer; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013 Following Lichtenberg's arrest, Sommer reported to Bishop von Preysing. While working for the Welfare Office, Sommer coordinated Catholic aid for victims of racial persecution‚Äîgiving spiritual comfort, food, clothing, and money. She gathered intelligence on the deportations of the Jews, and living conditions in concentration camps, as well as on SS firing squads, writing several reports on these topics from 1942; including an August 1942 report which reached Rome under the title \\"Report on the Exodus of the Jews\\". ; Knowledge of the Holocaust Unlike the Nazi euthanasia murder of invalids, which the churches led protests against, the Final Solution liquidation of the Jews did not primarily take place on German soil, but rather in Polish territory. Awareness of the murderous campaign was therefore less widespread.Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933‚Äì1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p.24 Susan Zuccotti has written that the Vatican was aware of the creation of the Nazi extermination camps. She believed an \\"open condemnation of racism and the persecutions (of Jews)\\" by the Church, \\"other results could have been achieved.\\" With regard to work done by the Vatican, \\"much more was requested by many\\". Indeed, \\"much more was hoped for by the Jews.\\", wrote Zuccotti.Under His Very Windows The Vatican and the Holocaust in Italy By Susan Zuccotti. Yale University Press pg. 304 According to historians David Bankier and Hans Mommsen a thorough knowledge of the Holocaust was well within the reach of the German bishops. According to historian Michael Phayer, \\"a number of bishops did want to know, and they succeeded very early on in discovering what their government was doing to the Jews in occupied Poland\\".Phayer, 2000, p. 68 , for example, knew about the systematic nature of the Holocaust as early as February 1942, only one month after the Wannsee Conference. Most German Church historians believe that the church leaders knew of the Holocaust by the end of 1942, knowing more than any other church leaders outside the Vatican. US Envoy Myron C. Taylor passed a US Government memorandum to Pius XII on 26 September 1942, outlining intelligence received from the Jewish Agency for Palestine which said that Jews from across the Nazi Empire were being systematically \\"butchered\\". Taylor asked if the Vatican might have any information which might tend to \\"confirm the reports\\", and if so, what the Pope might be able to do to influence public opinion against the \\"barbarities\\".Diplomatic Correspondence: US Envoy Myron C. Taylor to Cardinal Maglione; 26 September 1942. Cardinal Maglione handed Harold Tittman a response to a letter from Taylor regarding the mistreatment of Jews on 10 October. The note thanked Washington for passing on the intelligence, and confirmed that reports of severe measures against the Jews had reached the Vatican from other sources, though it had not been possible to \\"verify their accuracy\\". Nevertheless, \\"every opportunity is being taken by the Holy See, however, to mitigate the suffering of these unfortunate people\\".Diplomatic Correspondence: US Undersecretary of State Summner Wells to Vatican Envoy Myron C. Taylor; 21 October 1942. The Pope raised race murders in his 1942 Christmas Radio Address. However, after the war, some bishops, including Adolf Bertram and Conrad Gr√∂ber claimed that they had not been aware of the extent and details of the Holocaust, and were unsure of the veracity of the information that was brought to their attention.Phayer, 2000, p. 70  Catholic Church in the Nazi Empire = Central Europe  ;Austria The Nazi Gauleiter of Vienna, Odilo Globoƒçnik. Following the Anschluss, he launched a crusade against the Church, and the Nazis confiscated property, closed Catholic organisations and sent many priests to Dachau. The Anschluss saw the annexation of mainly Catholic Austria by Nazi Germany in early 1938. Hitler initially attempted to appeal to Christians in a speech on April 9 in Vienna, when he told the Austrian public that it was \\"God's will\\" he lead his homeland into the Reich and the Lord had \\"smitten\\" his opponents.Shirer, 1990, pp. 349‚Äì350. At the direction of Cardinal Innitzer, the churches of Vienna pealed their bells and flew swastikas for Hitler's arrival in the city on 14 March.Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; W.W. Norton & Co; London; p. 413 However, wrote Mark Mazower, such gestures of accommodation were \\"not enough to assuage the Austrian Nazi radicals, foremost among them the young Gauleiter Globoƒçnik\\".Mark Mazower; Hitler's Empire - Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe; Penguin; 2008; ; pp. 51‚Äì52 Globocnik launched a crusade against the Church, and the Nazis confiscated property, closed Catholic organisations and sent many priests to Dachau, including Jakob Gapp and Otto Neururer. Neururer was tortured and hanged at Buchenwald and Gapp was guillotined in Berlin; both were beatified in 1996. Anger at the treatment of the Church in Austria grew quickly and October 1938, wrote Mazower, saw the \\"very first act of overt mass resistance to the new regime\\", when a rally of thousands left Mass in Vienna chanting \\"Christ is our Fuehrer\\", before being dispersed by police.Mark Mazower; Hitler's Empire - Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe; Penguin; 2008; ; p.52 A Nazi mob ransacked Cardinal Innitzer's residence, after he had denounced Nazi persecution of the Church. L'Osservatore Romano reported on 15 October that Hitler Youth and the SA had gathered at Innitzer's Cathedral during a service for Catholic Youth and started \\"counter-shouts and whistlings: 'Down with Innitzer! Our faith is Germany'\\". The following day, a mob stoned the Cardinal's residence, broke in and ransacked it‚Äîbashing a secretary unconscious, and storming another house of the cathedral curia and throwing its curate out the window.The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942; pp. 29‚Äì30 The American National Catholic Welfare Conference wrote that Pope Pius, \\"again protested against the violence of the Nazis, in language recalling Nero and Judas the Betrayer, comparing Hitler with Julian the Apostate.\\" In a Table Talk of July 1942 discussing his problems with the Church, Hitler singles out Innitzer's early gestures of cordiality as evidence of the extreme caution with which Church diplomats must be treated: \\"there appeared a man who addressed me with such self-assurance and beaming countenance, just as if, throughout the whole of the Austrian Republic he had never even touched a hair of the head of any National Socialist!\\" ;Czech lands Reinhard Heydrich, the Nazi governor of Bohemia and Moravia (Czech region). One of the main architects of the Nazi Holocaust, he believed that Catholicism was a threat to the state.Williams, Max (2001). Reinhard Heydrich: The Biography, Volume 1‚ÄîRoad To War.

Czechoslovakia was created after World War I and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: Czechoslovak History; web 4 June 2013 Shortly before World War II, Czechoslovakia ceased to exist, swallowed by Nazi expansion. Its territory was divided into the mainly Czech Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, and the newly declared Slovak Republic, while a considerable part of Czechoslovakia was directly joined to the Third Reich (Hungary and Poland also annexed areas). Catholicism had had a strong institutional presence in the region under the Habsburg Dynasty, but Bohemian Czechs in particular had a troubled relationship with the Church of their rulers.Encyclopedia Online; Bohemia; web 4 June 2013 Despite this, According to Schnitker, \\"the Church managed to gain a deep-seated appreciation for the role it played in resisting the common Nazi enemy.\\"Catholicism, Nationalism and Nazism amongst the Czechs, Slovaks and Hungarians; by Harry Schnitker; 24 October 2011 Some 487 Czechoslovak priests were arrested and jailed during the occupation.Vincent A.

Seventy- six did not survive the ordeal.Fighter Against Dictatorships - Cardinal Josef Beran; by Chris Johnson for Radio Prague; 23 December 2009 Following its October 1938 annexation, Nazi policy in the Sudetenland saw ethnic Czech priests expelled, or deprived of income and forced to do labour, while their properties were seized. Religious orders were suppressed, private schools closed and religious instruction forbidden in schools.The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942; pp. 31‚Äì32 When the Germans advanced on Prague in March 1939, churches came under gestapo surveillance and hundreds of priests were denounced. Monasteries and convents were requisitioned and Corpus Christi processions curtailed. As elsewhere, the Catholic press was muzzled. Following the outbreak of war, 487 priests were rounded up from occupied Czechoslovakia‚Äîamong them the Canon of Vysehrad, Msgr. Bohumil Sta≈°ek.The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942; pp. 31‚Äì33 On 13 August 1939, Sta≈°ek had given a patriotic address to a 100,000 strong crowd of Czechoslovaks, criticising the Nazis: \\"I believed that truth would triumph over falsehood, law over lawlessness, love and compassion over violence\\". For his resistance efforts, Bohumil spent the remainder of the war in prison and the concentration camps.Democracy and Myth in Russia and Eastern Europe; edited by Alexander Woll and Harald Wydra; Taylor & Francis e-library; 2007; p 118 Msgr. Tenora, Dean of the Brno Cathedral was also among those arrested, while six directors of Catholic charities were also seized including Mgr Otto Lev Stanovsky. Karel Ka≈°par, the Archbishop of Prague and Primate of Bohemia was arrested soon after the occupation of his city, after he refused to obey an order to direct priests to discontinue pilgrimages. Kaspar was repeatedly arrested by the Nazi authorities and died in 1941. In announcing the Archbishop's death on radio, Josef Beran, the director of the Prague diocese main seminary, called on Czechs to remain true to their religion and to their country. Konstantin von Neurath served as Reich Protector (Governor) from March 1939 until he was replaced by Reich Security Central Office chief Reinhard Heydrich. Heydrich was a fanatical Nazi anti-Semite and anti- Catholic. One of the main architects of the Nazi Holocaust, he believed that Catholicism was a threat to the state.Williams, Max (2001). Reinhard Heydrich: The Biography, Volume 1‚ÄîRoad To War. Church Stretton: Ulric Publishing. ; p. 66. He was assassinated by Czech commandos in Prague in 1942.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online - Reinhard Heydrich;; web 23 May 2013 Hitler was angered by the co-operation between the church and the assassins who killed Heydrich.Hitler's Table Talk 1941‚Äì1944: ch A Hungarian Request; Cameron & Stevens; Enigma Books pp. 551‚Äì56 Following the assassination of Heydrich, Josef Beran was among the thousands arrested, for his patriotic stance. Beran was sent to Dachau, where he remained until Liberation, whereafter he was appointed Archbishop of Prague‚Äîwhich had remained vacant since the death of Ka≈°par. Friedrich Hoffman, a Czech priest, testifies at the trial of camp personnel from Dachau, where over a thousand clergy died. 122 Czechoslovak priests were imprisoned there, but Poles constituted the largest proportion of those imprisoned in the dedicated Clergy Barracks. ;Slovakia Slovakia was a rump state formed by Hitler when Germany annexed the western half of Czechoslovakia. Hitler was able to exploit Czechoslovakia's ethnic rivalries‚Äîparticularly presence of the German-speaking Sudetenlanders, and the independent minded Slovaks.Shirer, 1990, pp. 358‚Äì59 The Slovak People's Party (SPP) had been founded in 1913 by a Catholic priest, Andrej Hlinka, and wanted Slovak autonomy.The Churches and the Deportation and Persecution of Jews in Slovakia; by Livia Rothkirchen; Vad Yashem. The extreme-nationalist lawyer Vojtech Tuka headed the party's radical wing, which moved steadily closer to National Socialism, complete with Hlinka Guard paramilitary.Evans, 2008, p. 395 In March 1939, Prague arrested Hlinka's successor, Fr. Jozef Tiso, the Prime Minister of the Slovakian region, for advocating independence. Hitler invited Tiso to Berlin, and offered assistance for Slovak nationhood. Tiso declared independence, and with German warships pointing their guns at the Slovakian Government offices, the Assembly agreed to ask Germany for \\"protection\\".Kershaw, 2008, p. 476 The small and predominantly Catholic and agricultural region became the Fascist Slovak Republic, a nominally independent Nazi puppet state, with Tiso as president and Tuka as Minister- President. Tiso's role was largely ceremonial, while Tuka was the instrument of Nazi policy in the state.Vincent A. Lapomarda; The Jesuits and the Third Reich; 2nd Edn, Edwin Mellen Press; 2005; p. 109 On 28 July 1940, Hitler instructed Tiso and Tuka to impose antisemitic laws. SS Officer Dieter Wisliceny was dispatched to act as an adviser on Jewish issues.Evans, 2008, p. 396 According to Phayer, \\"Hitler demanded a price for Slovak independence, its 90,000 Jews. Pius XII wanted to save them, or at least the 20,000 who had converted to Christianity\\".Phayer, 2000, p. 87 Giuseppe Burzio, the Apostolic Delegate to Bratislava, protested the antisemitism and totalitarianism of the regime. Pius XII extended an apostolic blessing to Tiso. The Vatican was pleased to see a new Catholic state, but disapproved of the Codex Judaicum of September 1941 (based on the Nuremberg Laws) by which the legal rights of Jews were ended. The Holy See reacted with a letter of protest. The Slovakian bishops told Tiso that, through persecution of people on the basis of their race, he acted against the principles of religion and the Vatican demoted Tiso. According to Phayer, the Vatican's main concern was for the rights of Jewish converts.Phayer, 2000, pp. 13‚Äì14 Monsignor Jozef Tiso the priest- president of the Nazi puppet state of Slovakia, meeting Hitler. Slovakia, under Tiso and Tuka (who described himself as a daily communicant), had power over 90,000 Jews. Like the Nazis other main allies, Petain, Mussolini, and Horthy‚ÄîTiso did not share the racist hardline on Jews held by Hitler and radicals within his own government, but held a more traditional, conservative antisemitism.Mark Mazower; Hitler's Empire - Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe; Penguin; 2008; ; pp.393 His regime was nonetheless highly antisemitic.Mark Mazower; Hitler's Empire - Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe; Penguin; 2008; ; pp.394 Phayer wrote that antisemitism existed well before the Nazi time and during the interwar period \\"antisemitism characterised the Catholicism of the Slovak people\\".Phayer, 2000, p. 14 The People's Party, founded and dominated by clergymen, used antisemitism as part of its political presentation. Antisemitic terror was practised by the Hlinka Guard. Tiso promulgated the first antisemitic legislation in 1939 and 1940. In February 1942, Tiso agreed to begin deportations of Jews and Slovakia became the first Nazi ally to agree to deportations under the framework of the Final Solution. The Nazis had asked for 20,000 young able-bodied Jews. Tiso hoped that compliance would aid in the return of 120,000 Slovak workers from Germany.Mark Mazower; Hitler's Empire - Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe; Penguin; 2008; ; p.394 Burzio protested to Prime Minister Vojtech Tuka. Later in 1942, amid Vatican protests as news of the fate of the deportees filtered back, and the German advance into Russia was halted, Slovakia became the first of Hitler's puppet states to shut down the deportations.Mark Mazower; Hitler's Empire - Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe; Penguin; 2008; ; p.395 The Vatican began to receive reports from Slovak army chaplains in October 1941 of mass shootings of Jews on the Eastern Front, but did not take action. When, in early 1942, papal diplomats in Bratislava, Hungary and Switzerland predicted impending deportations and exterminations, the Vatican protested. Burzio advised Rome of deportations to Poland \\"equivalent to condemning a great part of them to death\\" and the Vatican protested to the Slovakian legate. According to Phayer, the protests, not made in public, were ineffectual and 'resettlements' continued in the summer and autumn of 1942‚Äî57,752 by the end of 1942.Phayer, 2000, p. 88 Burzio reported to Rome that some of the Slovakian bishops were indifferent to the plight of the Jews. Others, such as Bishop Pavol Jantausch and Bishop Pavol Gojdiƒç were active in protecting Jews.Phayer, 2000, p. 89 The Vicar of Bratislava and , Bishop of Pre≈°ov, emphatically denounced the deportations. Knowledge of the conditions at Auschwitz began to spread. Mazower wrote: \\"When the Vatican protested, the government responded with defiance: 'There is no foreign intervention which would stop us on the road to the liberation of Slovakia from Jewry', insisted President Tiso\\".Mark Mazower; Hitler's Empire - Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe; Penguin; 2008; ; p.396 Distressing scenes at railway yards of deportees being beaten by Hlinka guards had spurred community protest, including from leading churchmen such as Bishop Pavol Jantausch.Evans, 2008, pp. 396‚Äì397 The Vatican called in the Slovak ambassador twice to enquire what was happening. These interventions, wrote Evans, \\"caused Tiso, who after all was still a priest in holy orders, to have second thoughts about the programme\\".Evans, 2008, pp. 397 Burzio and others reported to Tiso that the Germans were murdering the deported Jews. Tiso hesitated and then refused to deport Slovakia's 24,000 remaining Jews. According to Mazower \\"Church pressure and public anger resulted in perhaps 20,000 Jews being granted exemptions, effectively bringing the deportations there to an end\\". According to Phayer, Raul Hilberg wrote that \\"Catholic Slovakia, wanting to serve its two masters, Berlin and Rome, gave up its Mosaic Jews‚Äîa journey by train to Auschwitz required one hour‚Äîto please Hitler, while holding back its 20,000 Christian Jews to please the Holy See\\". When in 1943 rumours of further deportations emerged, the Papal Nuncio in Istanbul, Msgr. Angelo Roncalli (later Pope John XXIII) and Burzio helped galvanize the Holy See into intervening in vigorous terms. On April 7, 1943, Burzio challenged Tuka, over the extermination of Slovak Jews. The Vatican condemned the renewal of the deportations on 5 May and the Slovakian episcopate issued a pastoral letter condemning totalitarianism and antisemitism on 8 May 1943. \\"Tuka\\", wrote Evans, was \\"forced to backtrack by public protests, especially from the Church, which by this time had been convinced of the fate that awaited the deportees. Pressure from the Germans, including a direct confrontation between Hitler and Tiso on 22 April 1943, remained without effect.\\"Evans, 2008, p. 397 In August 1944, the Slovak National Uprising rose against the People's Party regime. German troops were sent to quell the rebellion and with them came security police charged with rounding up Slovakia's remaining Jews. Burzio begged Tiso directly to at least spare Catholic Jews from transportation and delivered an admonition from the Pope: \\"the injustice wrought by his government is harmful to the prestige of his country and enemies will exploit it to discredit clergy and the Church the world over.\\" Tiso ordered the deportation of the nation's remaining Jews, who were sent to the concentration camps‚Äîmost to Auschwitz.  Eastern Europe  ;Poland a brutal persecution under Nazi Occupation. Kerhsaw wrote that Hitler's scheme for the Germanization of Eastern Europe, \\"There would, he made clear, be no place in this utopia for the Christian Churches\\".Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; W.W. Norton & Co; London p. 661 The invasion of predominantly Catholic Poland by Nazi Germany in 1939 ignited the Second World War. The Nazi plan for Poland entailed the destruction of the Polish nation, which necessarily required attacking the Polish Church, particularly, in those areas annexed to Germany.Jozef Garlinski; Poland and the Second World War; Macmillan Press, 1985; p 60 In Nazi ideological terms, Poland was inhabited by a mixture of Slavs and Jews, both of which were classed as Untermenschen, or subhumans occupying German Lebensraum, living space.Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003 The Nazis instigated a policy of genocide against Poland's Jewish minority and murdering or suppressing the ethnic Polish elites. Historically, the church was a leading force in Polish nationalism against foreign domination, thus the Nazis targeted clergy, monks and nuns in their terror campaigns‚Äîboth for their resistance activity and their cultural importance.Phayer, 2000, p. 22 According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1811 Polish priests died in Nazi concentration camps.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online - Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski; Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc; 2013; web 14 Apr. 2013. Special death squads of SS and police accompanied the invasion and arrested or executed those considered capable of resisting the occupation: including professionals, clergymen and government officials. The following summer, the A-B Aktion round up of several thousand Polish intelligentsia by the SS saw many priests shot in the General Government sector. In September 1939 Security Police Chief Heydrich and General Eduard Wagner agreed upon a \\"cleanup once and for all of Jews, intelligentsia, clergy, nobility\\".Raul Hilberg, The Destruction of the European Jews, I.191 Of the brief period of military control from 1 September 1939 to 25 October 1939, Davies wrote: \\"according to one source, 714 mass executions were carried out, and 6,376 people, mainly Catholics, were shot. Others put the death toll in one town alone at 20,000. It was a taste of things to come.\\"Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; pp. 85‚Äì6 Poland was divided into two parts by the Nazis: the Reich directly annexed Polish territories along Germany's eastern border, while and second part came under the administration of the so-called Generalgouvernement (General Government)‚Äîa \\"police run mini- state\\" under SS control and the rule of Nazi lawyer Hans Frank, which, wrote Davies, \\"became the lawless laboratory of Nazi racial ideology\\" and in due course the base for the main Nazi concentration camps.Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; p.86 Yet here, Nazi policy toward the Church was less severe than in the annexed regions.Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; p.92 The annexed areas were all to be \\"Germanized\\", and the Polish Church within them was to be thoroughly eradicated‚Äîthough German Catholics could remain or settle there. In the annexed regions, the Nazis set about systematically dismantling the Church‚Äîarresting its leaders, exiling its clergymen, closing its churches, monasteries and convents. Many clergymen were murdered.http://www.yadvashem.org/download/about_holocaust/christian_world/libionka.pdf Eighty per cent of the Catholic clergy and five bishops of Warthegau were sent to concentration camps in 1939; 108 of them are regarded as blessed martyrs.Craughwell, Thomas J., The Gentile Holocaust Catholic Culture, Accessed July 18, 2008 In a report to Pius XII regarding the dire situation, the Primate of Poland, Cardinal Hlond wrote that \\"Hitlerism aims at the systematic and total destruction of the Catholic Church in the ... territories of Poland which have been incorporated into the Reich ...\\":The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942; pp. 34‚Äì51 Bishop Sapieha, 1942. The Polish Franciscan St Maximilian Kolbe died at Auschwitz. Following the surrender of Warsaw and Hel Fortified Area, the Polish Underground and the Armia Krajowa (Home Army) resisted the Nazi occupation. The Home Army was conscious of the link between morale and religious practice and the Catholic religion was integral to much Polish resistance, particularly during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; p.402 Adam Sapieha, Archbishop of Krak√≥w became the de facto head of the Polish church following the invasion and openly criticised Nazi terror. A principal figure of the Polish Resistance, Sapieha opened a clandestine seminary in an act of cultural resistance. Among the seminarians was Karol Wojtyla, the future Pope John Paul II. Among the most revered Polish martyrs was the Franciscan, Saint Maximilian Kolbe, who died at Auschwitz-Birkenau, having offered his own life to save a fellow prisoner who had been condemned to death. During the War he provided shelter to refugees, including 2,000 Jews whom he hid in his friary in Niepokalan√≥w. Poland had a large Jewish population, and according to Davies, more Jews were both killed and rescued in Poland, than in any other nation: the rescue figure put at between 100,000 and 150,000‚Äîthe work of the Catholic affiliated Council to Aid Jews was instrumental in much rescue work.Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; p.200 Thousands of Poles have been honoured as Righteous Among the Gentiles‚Äîconstituting the largest national contingentNorman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; p594‚Äîand hundreds of clergymen and nuns were involved in aiding Jews during the war, though precise numbers are difficult to confirm. When AK Home Army Intelligence discovered the true fate of transports leaving the Jewish Ghetto, the Council to Aid Jews‚ÄîRada Pomocy ≈ªydom (codename ≈ªegota) was established in late 1942, in co-operation with church groups. Instigated by the writer Zofia Kossak-Szczucka and Catholic democrat activists, the organisation saved thousands. Emphasis was placed on protecting children, as it was near impossible to intervene directly against the heavily guarded transports. False papers were prepared, and children were distributed among safe houses and church networks.Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; p.200 Jewish children were often placed in church orphanages and convents. Karol Niemira, the Bishop of Pinsk, co-operated with the Underground maintaining ties with the Jewish ghetto and sheltered Jews in the Archbishop's residence. Matylda Getter, mother superior of the Franciscan Sisters of the Family of Mary, hid many children in her Pludy convent and took in many orphans and dispersed them among Family of Mary homes, rescuing more than 750 Jews.Phayer, 2000, p. 117 Oskar Schindler, a German Catholic businessman came to Poland, initially to profit from the German invasion. He went on to save many Jews, as dramatised in the film Schindler's List. Under the Papacy of the Polish-born Pope John Paul II, the Polish Church asked for forgiveness for failings during the war, saying that, while noble efforts had been made to save Jews during World War II, there had also been indifference or enmity among Polish Catholics. According to Norman Davies, the Nazi terror was \\"much fiercer and more protracted in Poland than anywhere in Europe.\\" Phayer wrote of two phases of Nazi policy in Poland‚Äîbefore Stalingrad, when Poles were suppressed, and after the battles of Stalingrad and Kursk, when Germany sought to use the church to bring the Polish people into the war effort against Russia. When Cardinal Hlond was captured in 1943 the Germans promised to free him if he would seek to inspire the Polish people against the common enemy, Bolshevist Russia.Phayer, 2000, p. 29 Hlond refused to negotiate with his captors. He was the only member of the Sacred College of Cardinals to be arrested by the Nazis, and was held by the Gestapo, first at their headquarters in Paris and then confined at a convent at Bar-le-Duc, until the Allied advance forced the Germans to shift him to Wiedenbrtick, in Westphalia, where he remained for seven months, until released by American troops in 1945.August, Cardinal Hlond; The Tablet; Page 4, 30th October 1948 Polish prisoners toast their liberation from Dachau concentration camp. Among the estimated 3,000 members (18%) of the Polish clergy who were killed by the Nazis; of these, 1,992 died in concentration camps. In response to the Nazi/Soviet invasion, Pope Pius XII's first encyclical Summi Pontificatus wrote of an \\"hour of darkness\\" and the deaths of \\"countless human beings, even noncombatants\\". \\"Dear Poland\\", he said, deserved \\"the generous and brotherly sympathy of the whole world, while it awaits ... the hour of a resurrection in harmony with the principles of justice and true peace\\".Summi Pontificatus 106 - Pope Pius XII, Oct. 1939 In April 1940, the Holy See advised the US government that all its efforts to deliver humanitarian aid had been blocked by the Germans, and that it was therefore seeking to channel assistance through indirect routes like the American \\"Commission for Polish Relief\\".FDR Library; Diplomatic Correspondence: Vatican Secretary of State to Myron C Taylor, 26 April 1940 In 1942, the American National Catholic Welfare Conference reported that \\"as Cardinal Hlond's reports poured into the Vatican, Pope Pius XII protested against the enormities they recounted with unrelenting vigor\\". The Conference noted the Pope's 28 October Encyclical and reported that Pius addressed Polish clergy on 30 September 1939 and spoke of \\"a vision of mad horror and gloomy despair\\" and said that he hoped that despite the work of the enemies of God, Catholic life would survive in Poland. In a Christmas Eve address to the College of Cardinals, Pius condemned the atrocities \\"even against non-combatants, refugees, old persons, women and children, and the disregard of human dignity, liberty and human life\\" that had taken place in the Polish war as \\"acts that cry for the vengeance of God\\".The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942; p. 49 According to Phayer, from 1939 to 1941 there was a determined appeal for papal intercession in Poland, but the Holy See argued that intervention would only worsen the situation, though this was not a popular position. When the French urged Pius to condemn Germany's aggression he declined \\"out of consideration for repercussions on Roman Catholics of the Reich.\\"Phayer, 2000, p. 24 August Hlond and the General of the Jesuits Wlodimir Led√≥chowski met with Pius on September 30, 1940 and left disappointed when he did not condemn Russia and Germany for destroying Poland. The Vatican used its press and radio to tell the world in January 1940 of terrorization of the Polish people, a reference to the Warthegau area Poles and the Poles of the Polish Corridor who had been dispossessed and driven into the General Government region. A further broadcast in November lacked the detail of January communications and \\"Thereafter\\", wrote Phayer, \\"Vatican radio fell silent regarding Poland and the decimation of its populace.\\"Phayer, 2000m p. 25 On 16 and 17 November 1940, Vatican Radio said that religious life for Catholics in Poland continued to be brutally restricted and that at least 400 clergy had been deported to Germany in the preceding four months:The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942; pp. 49‚Äì50 In November 1941 Bishop Sapieha requested explicitly that Pius speak out against Nazi atrocities. According to Lucas, the pope's \\"silence\\" led some Polish Catholics to conclude that the Vatican was unconcerned and there was even talk of cutting off allegiance to Rome.Lucas, Forgotten Holocaust, University of Kentucky Press, 1986, p. 16 Pius alluded vaguely to atrocities at Easter 1941 and Cardinal Secretry of State Luigi Maglione explained to the Polish ambassador to the Holy See that Pius spoke in veiled words, but had Poland in mind. The policy was intended to spare Poles from greater atrocities. Word came later from Poland objecting to this, but it would be used again, during the Holocaust itself. Catholic religious fervour was a feature of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. General Antoni Chru≈õciel issued instructions on how front-line troops could continue to continue religious observance. Clergy were involved on many levels‚Äîas chaplains to military units, or tending to the ever-increasing wounded and dying. \\"Nuns of various orders\\", wrote Davies, \\"acted as universal sisters of mercy and won widespread praise. Mortality among them higher than among most categories of civilians. When captured by the SS, they aroused a special fury, which frequently ended in rape or butchery\\".Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; pp. 403‚Äì405 According to Davies, the Catholic religion was an integral component of the struggle.Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; p402 ;Hungary Cardinal Jusztini√°n Gy√∂rgy Ser√©di. As a member of Hungary's Parliament he voted in favour of antisemitic legislation in 1938.Phayer, 2000, p. 13 Later he spoke against Nazi mistreatment of the Jews.Cardinal Appeals for Jews; New York Times, April 27, 1944, p. 5 Hungary joined the Axis Powers in 1940. Its leader, Admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy later wavered in support for the Nazi alliance. The Nazis occupied Hungary in March 1944, soon after Horthy, under significant pressure from the church and diplomatic community, had halted the deportations of Hungarian Jews. In October, they installed a pro-Nazi Arrow Cross Dictatorship. After Germany's 1935 Nuremberg Laws were promulgated, copycat legislation had followed in much of Europe. Catholic priests and bishops in western Europe were not active in parliaments that established antisemitic legislation, but in eastern Europe they were. The Arrow Cross, Hungary's far-right antisemitic political organisation, was supported by individual priests, and bishops, such as J√≥zsef Gr≈ësz, who was promoted in 1943 by Pius XII to the bishopric of Kalocsa. Cardinal Jusztini√°n Gy√∂rgy Ser√©di and Bishop Gyula Glattfelder who served in Hungary's Upper Chamber of Parliament, voted in favour of antisemitic legislation first passed in 1938.Moshe Herczl, Christianity and the Holocaust of Hungarian Jewry, New York, Harper & Row, p. 118 Ser√©di later spoke out against the Nazi persecution of Hungary's Jews. The antisemitic laws placed economic and social restrictions on Jews; during World War II they evolved into initiatives to expel Jews from Hungary. Margit Slachta, a nun and Hungary's first woman Member of Parliament, spoke against the antisemitic laws. Following the October 1944 Arrow Cross takeover, Bishop Vilmos Apor (who had been an active protester against the mistreatment of the Jews), together with other senior clergy including J√≥zsef Mindszenty, drafted a memorandum of protest against the Arrow Cross government. Memorial plaque to Papal Nuncio Angelo Rotta. Honoured as a Righteous Gentile, he was active in saving Hungarian Jews. Margit Slachta sheltered the persecuted, protested forced labour and antisemitism and went to Rome in 1943 to encourage papal action against the Jewish persecutions. Angelo Rotta, Papal Nuncio from 1930, actively protested Hungary's mistreatment of the Jews, and helped persuade Pope Pius XII to lobby the Hungarian leader Admiral Horthy to stop their deportation. Rotta became a leader of diplomatic actions to protect Hungarian Jews. With the help of the Hungarian Holy Cross Association, he issued protective passports for Jews and 15,000 safe conduct passes‚Äîthe nunciature sheltered some 3000 Jews in safe houses. An \\"International Ghetto\\" was established, including more than 40 safe houses marked by the Vatican and other national emblems. 25,000 Jews found refuge in these safe houses. Elsewhere in the city, Catholic institutions hid several thousand more Jewish people.Hitler's Pope? ; by Sir Martin Gilbert, The American Spectator. Other leading church figures involved in the 1944 rescue of Hungarian Jews included Bishops Vilmos Apor, Endre Hamvas and √Åron M√°rton. Primate J√≥zsef Mindszenty issued public and private protests and was arrested on 27 October 1944. By late summer 1944 Pius XII was asked to speak directly to the Hungarian people, ideally through Vatican Radio, now that the diplomatic avenues were exhausted. A direct public appeal it was felt, especially in American circles, might have some effect. This Pius XII would not do however, arguing that a public radio appeal and condemnation of Nazi actions, would necessitate a papal criticism of Soviet behaviour as well.Ventresca, 2013, p. 216 And there was apparently some skepticism still in Vatican circles about the seriousness of the situation. In September 1944 Amleto Cicognani, papal representative in Washington, told Aryeh Leon Kubowitzki (later Aryeh Leon Kubovy) of the World Jewish Congress that, \\"the situation in Hungary is much less acute, since the persons responsible for the previous persecution have been removed from power\\". \\"Contradictory information\\", it was claimed, was arriving about the Hungarian situation. Ultimately, when called upon to condemn publicly Nazi policies against Jews Pius XII chose to exercise restraint, in the name of avoiding a greater evil.Ventresca, 2013, pp. 215‚Äì17 ;Romania Angelo Roncalli (later Pope John XXIII) advised Pope Pius XII of the plight of Jews being kept in concentration camps in Romanian-occupied Transnistria. The Pope interceded with the Romanian government, and authorized for money to be sent to the camps. Andrea Cassulo, the papal nuncio to Bucharest has been honoured as Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem. In 1944, the Chief Rabbi of Bucharest praised the work of Cassulo on behalf of Romania's Jews: \\"the generous assistance of the Holy See ... was decisive and salutary. It is not easy for us to find the right words to express the warmth and consolation we experienced because of the concern of the supreme Pontiff, who offered a large sum to relieve the sufferings of deported Jews‚Äîsufferings which had been pointed out to him by you after your visit to Transnistria. The Jews of Romania will never forget these facts of historic importance.\\"  Southern Europe  ;Croatia After World War I, the desire of Croatian nationalists for independence was not realised. The region found itself in a Serb dominated dictatorship of Yugoslavia. Repression of the Croat minority spurred extremism, and the Usta≈°a (\\"Insurgence\\") was formed in 1929 by Ante Paveliƒá, with the support of Fascist Italy.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: Croatia in Yugoslavia, 1918‚Äì41; from Croatia Article; retrieved 7 October 2013 Germany, Italy, Bulgaria and Hungary dismembered Yugoslavia in April 1941.Hebblethwaite, 1993, p .153 In regions controlled by Italy, the Italian authorities protected Jews from Nazi roundups, as occurred throughout Italian territory. Martin Gilbert wrote that when negotiations began for the deportation of Jews from the Italian zone, General Roatta flatly refused, leading Hitler's envoy, Siegfried Kasche, to report some of Mussolini's subordinates \\"apparently been influenced\\" by opposition in the Vatican to German anti-Semitism.Martin Gilbert; The Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy; Collins; London; 1986; p. 466. Most of Croatia fell to the new Independent State of Croatia, where Pavelic's Ustase were installed in power. Unlike Hitler, Pavelic was pro-Catholic, but their ideologies overlapped sufficiently for easy co-operation. Phayer wrote, Pavelic wanted Vatican recognition for his fascist state and Croatian church leaders favoured an alliance with the Ustase because it seemed to hold out the promise of an anti-Communist, Catholic state.Phayer, 2000, p. 32 According to Hebblethwaite, Pavelic was anxious to get diplomatic relations and a Vatican blessing for the new 'Catholic state' but \\"Neither was forthcoming\\": Giovanni Montini (future Pope Paul VI) advised Pavelic the Holy See could not recognise frontiers changed by force. The Yugoslav royal legation remained at the Vatican. When the Italian King advised that Duke of Spoleto was to be \\"King of Croatia\\", Montini advised the Pope could not hold a private audience with the Duke once any such coronation occurred. Pius subsequently relented, allowing a half hour audience with Pavelic.Hebblethwaite, 1993, p. 153 The Archbishop of Zagreb, Aloysius Stepinac, wanted Croatia's independence from the Serb dominated Yugoslav state (the jail of the Croatian nation).Phayer, 2000, p. 32 Stepinac arranged the audience with Pius XII for Pavelic. Montini's minutes of the meeting noted no recognition of the new state could come before a peace treaty. \\"The Holy See must be impartial; it must think of all; there are Catholics on all sides to whom the [Holy See] must be respectful.\\"Hebblethwaite, 1993, pp. 153‚Äì4 Phayer wrote that Montini kept Pius informed of matters in Croatia and Domenico Tardini interviewed Pavelic's representative to Pius; he let the Croat know the Vatican would be indulgent‚Äî\\"Croatia is a young state‚ÄîYoungsters often err because of their age. It is, therefore, not surprising Croatia has also erred.\\"Phayer, p. 2000, 37 The Vatican refused formal recognition but Pius sent a Benedictine abbot, Giuseppe Ramiro Marcone, as his apostolic visitor. Phayer wrote that this suited Pavelic well enough. Stepinac felt the Vatican de facto recognised the new state. Gilbert wrote, \\"In the Croatian capital of Zagreb, as a result of intervention by [Marcone] on behalf of Jewish partners in mixed marriages, a thousand Croat Jews survived the war\\". While \\"Stepinac, who in 1941 welcomed Croat independence, subsequently condemned Croat atrocities against both Serbs and Jews, and saved a group of Jews in an old age home\\".Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ; p.203 Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac (far right). Initially Stepinac welcomed Croat independence and the Pavelic regime's atrocities against Jews and Serbs In April‚ÄìMay 1941, hundred of thousands of Serbs were murdered and Nazi copycat laws eliminated Jewish citizenship and compelled the wearing of the Star of David. The German army pulled out of Croatia in June 1941. As the terror continued Archbishop Stepinac had begun, May 1941, to distance himself from the Ustase.Phayer, 2000, p. 34 Hebblethwaite wrote, \\"The Vatican's policy was to strengthen the hand of [Spepinac] in his rejection of forcible conversions and brutalities\\".Hebblethwaite, 1993, p.157 Pavelic told Nazi Foreign Minister Ribbentrop while the lower clergy supported the Ustase, the bishops, and particularly Stepinac, were opposed to the movement because of \\"Vatican international policy\\". In July, Stepniac wrote to Pavelic objecting to the condition of deportation of Jews and Serbs. Then, realizing that conversion could save Serbs, he instructed clergy to baptise people upon demand without the usual waiting and instruction. Summer and autumn of 1941 Ustasha murders increased, but Stepinac was not yet prepared to break with the Ustase regime entirely. Some bishops and priests collaborated openly with Pavelic; even served in Pavelic's body guard. Ivan Guberina, the leader of Catholic Action, among them. Notorious examples of collaboration included Archbishop Ivan ≈†ariƒá and the Franciscan Miroslav Filipoviƒá-Majstorovic, 'the devil of the Jasenovac'. For three months,State Commission investigation of crimes of the occupiers and their collaborators in Croatia (1946). Crimes in the Jasenovac Camp. Zagreb; p. 62 Filipoviƒá-Majstorovic headed the notorious Jasenovac concentration camp.Phayer, 2000, p. 86 He was suspended as an army chaplain in 1942, expelled from the Franciscan Order in 1943, and executed as a war criminal after the war.Katoliƒçka crkva i Nezavisna Dr≈æava Hrvatska 1941‚Äì1945 by Jure Kri≈°to, Zagreb: 1998, p. 223Phayer,2000, p. 237 He was not, evidently, excommunicated.Phayer, 2000, p. 237; Frances Hetherington,Catholics, the State and the European Radical Right 1919‚Äì1945, p. 235 Phayer wrote that Archbishop Stepinac himself came to be known as jeudenfreundlich (Jew friendly) to the Nazis and Croat regime. And, suspended a number of priest collaboratos in his diocese. In the Spring of 1942, Stepinac, following a meeting with Pius XII in Rome, declared publicly it was \\"forbidden to exterminate Gypsies and Jews because they are said to belong to an inferior race\\".Michael Phayer; The Catholic Church and the Holocaust 1930‚Äì1965; Indiana University Press; 2000; p.38 When Himmler visited Zagreb a year later, indicating the impending roundup of remaining Jews, Stepinac wrote to Pavelic that if this occurred, he would protest for \\"the Catholic Church is not afraid of any secular power, whatever it may be, when it has to protect basic human values\\". When deportatation began, Stepinac and Marcone protested to Andrija Artukoviƒá.Phayer, p. 86 The Vatican ordered Stepinac to save as many Jews as possible during the upcoming roundup. In July and October 1943, Stepinac condemned race murders in the most explicit terms. And, his condemnation was read from pulpits across Croatia. The Germans took this to be a denunciation of the murder of both Serbs and Jews, and arrested 31 priests. Phayer wrote that despite knowing he would be a target of Communists if the Croat regime fell, \\"no leader of a national church ever spoke as pointedly about genocide as did Stepinac\\".Michael Phayer; The Catholic Church and the Holocaust 1930‚Äì1965; Indiana University Press; 2000; p.47 Though Stepinac personally saved many potential victims, his protests had little effect on Pavelic. The Apostolic delegate to Turkey, Angelo Roncalli, saved a number of Croatian Jews‚Äîas well as Bulgarian and Hungarian Jews‚Äî assisting their migration to Palestine. Roncalli succeeded Pius XII as Pope, always said he was acting on the orders of Pius XII in his actions to rescue Jews. In 1943 after the German military became active once again in Croatia, six to seven thousand Jews were deported to Auschwitz, others murdered in gas vans in Croatia. Rather than jeopardize the Ustase government by diplomatic wrangling, the Vatican chose to help Jews privately. But, the chaos of the country meant this was little. Historian John Morley called the Vatican record particularly shameful in Croatia because it was a state which proudly proclaimed its Catholic tradition. Whose leaders depicted themselves as loyal to the Church and the Pope.Phayer, 2000, p. 39 Diplomatic pressure was preferred to public challenges on the immorality of genocide. Pavelic's diplomatic emissaries to the Holy See were merely scolded by Tardini and Montini. At the war's end, leaders of the Ustasha, including its clericals supporters such as, Saric, fled taking gold looted from massacred Jews and Serbs with them.Phayer, 2000, p. 40 ; Slovenia The Nazi persecution of the Church in annexed Slovenia was akin to that which occurred in Poland. Within six weeks of the Nazi occupation, only 100 of the 831 priests in the Diocese of Maribor and part of the Diocese of Ljubljana remained free. Clergy were persecuted and sent to concentration camps, religious Orders had their properties seized, some youth were sterilized. The first priest to die was Aloysius Zuzek. Following the German invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Slovenia was partitioned, between Italy, Hungary and Germany, which annexed the north. In the Carinthian and Styrian regions, the mainly Austrian rulers commenced a brutal campaign to destroy the Slovene nation.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: Slovenia; web 1 Aug. 2013 The Jesuit John Le Farge reported in the Catholic press in the America that the situation an official report sent to the Vatican following the invasion \\"may be briefly described as hell for Catholics and Catholicism in Slovenia, a 98% Catholic country, a hell deliberately planned by Adolf Hitler out of his diabolical hatred of Christ and His Church\\". As in other occupied territories, the German army confiscated church property, dissolved religious houses and arrested and exiled priests.The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942; pp. 51‚Äì54  Western Europe  ;Low Countries The Nazi Occupation of the Netherlands was particularly protracted. While the Dutch civil service collaborated extensively with the occupying administration, the Dutch Church, and leaders like the Archbishop of Utrecht Johannes de Jong, firmly opposed National Socialist movement, which Dutch Catholics were forbidden to join.http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/pdf/resources/michman_holland.pdf As in other parts of the Nazi Empire, the Catholic press was suppressed. Clergy were arrested and forced out of educational positions. On 2 September 1940, the Nazi Governor of the Netherlands, Arthur Seyss-Inquart ordered a purge of clergy who refused to advocate National Socialism. In November, the office of the Bishop of Roermond and the Hague headquarters of the Jesuits were raided. On 26 January 1941, the Dutch Bishops issued a critical Pastoral Letter. The Nazi press responded with threats. The Nazi press also reported that Archbishop de Jong was fined for refusing to preach the Nazi invasion of Russia was a \\"religious crusade\\" against Bolshevism. When Seyss-Inquart installed a Dutch Nazi at the head of the Catholic Workers' Union, De Jong told Catholics to quit the Union.The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942; p. 57 The occupation of the Netherlands also saw a particularly efficient cruelty towards the Jews, and harsh punishment for their protectors. When Jewish deportations began, many were hidden in Catholic areas. Parish priests created networks hiding Jews. Close knit country parishes were able to hide Jews without being informed upon by neighbours, as occurred in the cities. On July 11, 1942, the Dutch bishops, joined all Christian denominations in sending a letter to the Nazi General Friedrich Christiansen in protest against the treatment of Jews. The letter was read in all Catholic churches against German opposition. It brought attention to mistreatment of Jews and asked all Christians to pray for them: The Nazis responded by revoking the exception of Jews who were baptized, and a round up was ordered. The Gestapo made a special effort to round up every monk, nun and priest who had a drop of Jewish blood. Some 300 victims were deported to Auschwitz and immediately sent to the gas chambers, among them Saint Edith Stein who was killed at Auschwitz. According to John Vidmar writes, \\"The brutality of the retaliation made an enormous impression on Pius XII.\\" Henceforth, he avoided open, confrontational denunciations of the Nazis. \\"It is clear from Maglione's intervention Papa Pacelli cared about and sought to avert the deportation of the Roman Jews but he did not denounce: a denunciation, the Pope believed, would do nothing to help the Jews. It would only extend Nazi persecution to yet more Catholics. It was the Church as well as the Jews in Germany, Poland and the rest of occupied Europe who would pay the price for any papal gesture. Another Dutch victim was Catholic dissident Carmelite priest and philosopher, Titus Brandsma. A journalist and a founder of the Netherlands' Catholic University in Nijmegen, Brandsma publicly campaigned against Nazism from the mid-1930s. Chosen by the Dutch Bishops as spokesmen in the defence of freedom of the press, he was arrested by the authorities in January 1942. He was later transferred to Dachau, where he was the subject of Nazi medical experiments and was issued with a lethal injection on 26 July 1942. The Church played an important role in the defence of Jews in Belgium. The Comit√© de D√©fense des Juifs (CDJ) was formed to work for the defence of Jews in the summer of 1942. Of its eight founding members, Emile Hambresin was Catholic. Some of their rescue operations were overseen by the priests Joseph Andr√© and Dom Bruno. Among other institutions, the CDJ enlisted the help of monasteries and religious schools and hospitals. Yvonne N√®vejean of the Oeuvre Nationale de l'Enfance greatly assisted with the hiding of Jewish children.Jewish Rescue Operations in Belgium and France; by Lucien Steinberg; published by Yad Vashem The Queen Mother Elizabeth and L√©on Platteau of the Interior Ministry also made a stance to protect Jews.http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%205956.pdf The Belgian Superior General of the Jesuits, Jean-Baptiste Janssens was also honoured as a Righteous Gentile by Yad Vashem. Following the Nazi occupation of Belgium, the Primate of Belgium Jozef-Ernst Cardinal van Roey wrote a refutation of Nazi racial doctrines and of the incompatibility of Catholicism and Nazism. In a dialogue, Van Roey wrote that Catholics could never adapt to governments which \\"oppress the rights of conscience and persecute the Catholic Church\\"; asserted the right to freedom of the press; and said Catholics ought not resign themselves to defeat and collaboration with the Nazis, because \\"we are certain that our country will be restored and rise again\\".The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942; pp. 58‚Äì59 ;France Charles de Gaulle's Free French chose the Catholic symbolism of Joan of Arc's standard, the red Cross of Lorraine as the symbol of their cause. Following the capitulation of France, the nation was divided between a military occupation of the north and the nominally independent \\"Vichy regime\\" in the south. Valerio Valeri remained nuncio to the divided nation. Marshal Philippe P√©tain, the leader of the Vichy government had no religious convictions, but courted Catholic support. His great rival, and leader of the Free French, General Charles de Gaulle was a devout Catholic. De Gaulle's Free French chose the Catholic symbolism of Saint Joan of Arc's standard, the Cross of Lorraine, as their emblem. As elsewhere under Nazi occupation, French clergy faced intimidation and interference. In July 1940, the residence of Cardinal Suhard, Archbishop of Paris, along with those of Cardinal Baudrillart and Cardinal Li√©nart and other church offices were searched by the Gestapo for \\"evidence of collusion between the late Cardinal Verdier and the Jews\\".The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942; p. 60 Verdier had described World War II as \\"a crusade ... We are struggling to preserve the freedom of people throughout the world, whether they be great or small peoples, and to preserve their possessions and their very lives. No other war has had aims that are more spiritual, moral, and, in sum, more Christian\\".TIME Magazine. \\"Crusade\\" February 19, 1940 On September 9, the Bishop of Quimper was arrested for opposing Nazi plans for Brittany. The Bishop of Strasbourg was prevented from returning from Vichy France to his dioceses and his Cathedral was closed to the public. The Bishop of Metz was expelled from his diocese‚Äîwhich was itself later dissolved for \\"political reasons\\".

Ida Botti Scifoni Self- portrait Life and marriage Ida Botti was born in Rome on November 7, 1812. She was raised in a middle-class family and excelled at an early age not only in painting portraits, which was socially accepted for a female painter, but also in painting more ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù historical and religious subjects. Ida married Felice Scifoni, a notary, writer, and a member of the Carbonari, a secret revolutionary society committed to the unification of Italy. His political activities led to his arrest and subsequent exile after the Romagna Insurrection in 1831. She died in Florence on June 13, 1844. Art and patronage Scifoni‚Äôs exile brought the family to Florence where Ida became the art teacher and friend of Mathilde Bonaparte. Niece of Napoleon, Mathilde was an established patroness of art and the wife of a Russian magnate, Anatoly Demidoff. The couple resided at the Villa in San Donato in Polverosa, which, under their patronage, became a meeting place for famous artists, intellectuals and scientists. This milieu led Ida Botti Scifoni to collaborate with poet Amelia Caini and with poet and patriot, Giovanni Battista Niccolini.

It became known as Bloemendaal. It is now part of the Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden. Bloemendaal means \\"valley of flowers\\". As a wheel club it was reached by the Missing Link Trail, which ran parallel to the Boulevard and Hermitage Road. Non-riders used the Lakeside Trolley. The clubhouse served \\"freshly made\\" ice cream. Ginter developed Lakeside Park around the clubhouse including a zoo and a public nine-hole golf course. The Richmond Times- Dispatch described in on March 15, 1896 as: \\"Within the enclosure are two large sheets of water, the clubhouse of the Lakeside bicycle club, a casino, cafe, bowling alley, billiard rooms, deer house, park office, and apartments for officers. The lake...specially stocked with fish...[is] supplied with an abundance of rowboats and a speedy two-horse power naptha launch.\\" It is now the Jefferson-Lakeside Country Club. Grace Arents remodeled the building and had a second story added. It was used as a convalescent home for Richmond's sick children. After the founding of the Instructional Visiting Nurses Association, the convalescent home was no longer needed. Arents and Mary Garland Smith moved into the mansion and named it Bloemendaal in homage to the Ginter family's Dutch ancestors (Bloemendaal means \\"valley of flowers\\" and she planted gardens on the property). She died in 1926 and left the property to the City of Richmond with the stipulation that after Smith died it was to be developed in a botanical garden honoring Lewis Ginter. Smith died in 1968 at the age of 100. The city of Richmond took possession of the property and it \\"languished\\". The property and its gardens were rescued by botanists, horticulturists and passionate citizens who formed the Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden, Inc. Lakeside Wheel Club Upon Lewis Ginter's return to Richmond from Australia, the Major began acquiring additional land on Richmond's northside. He created the Lakeside Wheel Club on the land he bought four years earlier. The clubhouse he built was a one-story Victorian structure surrounded on two sides by a covered veranda. The original concrete approach walks with their inlaid leaf patterns, the steps, concrete newel posts and wrought iron lamp standards remain today. The adjacent valley and waterways had long been the site of a millpond and were dammed to create Lakeside Lake. In the Gay Nineties cycling was a popular sport, and cyclists, cheered on by Richmond Belles, pedaled out to the Club on the cinder Missing Link Trail which ran along the Boulevard and Hermitage Road. Spectators of the cycling sport rode out on the Lakeside trolley and were discharged at the end of the line near the dam. After the grueling ride from town, cyclists could sit on the Wheel Club's long gallery and refresh themselves with homemade ice cream, while boaters drifted on the lake below. Earlier, north of the lake, Ginter had established Lakeside Park, with a zoo and Richmond's first professional nine- hole golf course. The granite base of the bear pit and many fine specimens of trees planted in an arboretum setting remain at the present day Jefferson Lakeside Club. When Lewis Ginter died in 1897, a large portion of his estate was inherited by his niece, Grace Arents. Arents devoted her life to philanthropy and gave generously to many causes and institutions. She was especially interested in helping the children of Oregon Hill. In 1913, she conceived the idea of a convalescent home in the country for sick infants who might benefit from the fresh air. To realize her dream, Miss Arents purchased the abandoned Lakeside Wheel Clubhouse and its approximately from the Lewis Ginter Land and Improvement Company. The structure was remodeled in the Dutch colonial style and named Bloemendaal Farm after a small village in the Netherlands which was the Ginter ancestral home. The name translates to \\"flower valley.\\" The roof was raised to provide a second floor of bedrooms, a classroom, a library and a playroom for the sick children. Miss Arents traveled extensively in Europe, and her trip diaries describe the joy she derived from her visits to continental botanical gardens. Her interest in horticulture, already strong, was heightened by her travels and found abundant expression at Bloemendaal Farm. She imported collections of rare trees and shrubs, constructed a series of three ridge and furrow greenhouses and laid out a border of herbaceous perennials along the side of the greenhouse range. Her great love of roses is evident in the photographs of Bloemendaal Farm taken in the 1920s. This garden, adjacent to the Bloemendaal House, exists today as the Grace Arents Garden. The immense ginkgo on the front lawn, the massive American hollies and the southern magnolias were planted by Miss Arents. Over the years, Miss Grace added piecemeal to the original area. Thus, she reunited some of the land that had belonged to the Powhatans, Patrick Henry, the Williamsons, John Robinson and others, and Bloemendaal Farm became widely known as a model for the best agricultural practices of the day. Seventy-eight-year-old Grace Arents died suddenly on June 20, 1926 leaving Bloemendaal Farm to the City of Richmond as a botanical garden and public park in perpetual memory of her Uncle Lewis Ginter to be known as Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden.

Doleman or R. Doleman), and dealing with the succession to Elizabeth I of England. The cover date is 1594, but the real publication date is taken to be around September 1595, in Amsterdam. The author has traditionally been identified with Robert Persons, an English Jesuit exile. It has also been suggested that Doleman is a collective pseudonym. Page from A Conference about the Next Succession, on the future succession to Elizabeth I, discussing Lady Arbella Stuart Impact A Conference was immediately effective in reopening the issue of the succession to Elizabeth, which at the time was difficult to debate in England. It provoked numerous replies, in the succession tract genre. It has also been considered a leading work of political thought of the period, arguing as it does in terms of resistance theory, and against the dynastic tradition of primogeniture. It was widely assumed at the time that the book's intention was to promote the claim to the English throne of Isabella Clara Eugenia. Background The application of the concept of heir presumptive became increasing problematic, and less relevant, as Elizabeth's reign progressed. Until her death in 1568, it fitted quite well the claim of Lady Catherine Grey to the throne, under the terms of the will of Henry VIII. Mary Queen of Scots had a leading dynastic claim to represent the House of Tudor, until her execution in 1587. Her son James VI of Scotland became then the most obvious successor, in terms of practical politics, but it was supposed that there might be legal arguments against his coming to the English throne. Such arguments had previously been developed against the claim of the Catholic Queen Mary; they could be applied to King James. A Conference was intended as an intervention in the debate on the succession. It set out a large number of genealogical facts, suggested that other criteria should be used, and hinted at the risk of a return to the instability of the Wars of the Roses. It hit at King James's claim to the extent that it depended on the House of Lancaster. Reaching back to the end of the 14th century, it traced his descent from an illegitimate son of Katherine Swynford. There had been a \\"succession crisis\\" in France from 1589, and from 1590 the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia had been the Spanish claimant. James VI has been taken as well-informed about the Gallican position on church and state, in his works on monarchy, and the French example remained significant for him to the later allegiance oath controversy. Content The work comprised, in part, analysis of around 14 succession candidates, in terms of five lineages with royal pretensions (including the House of Aviz). It put into play the succession to the English throne, by suggesting that elective monarchy, rather than hereditary monarchy, was a more appropriate way to address the succession issue. That approach was rebutted in most of the subsequent tracts. Genealogical content was supplied by William Allen and Sir Francis Englefield. Political context of the work Catholic political theory developed from the De iusta reipublicae christianae in reges impios et haereticos authoritate of William Rainolds (as Guilielmus Rossaeus, and perhaps writing with William Gifford), which was aimed at the French situation. The same general principles were then applied to England, probably by Persons, with Richard Verstegan and perhaps others.John Bossy, The Character of Elizabethan Catholicism, Past & Present No. 21 (Apr., 1962), pp. 39-59, at pp. 49‚Äì50. Published by: Oxford University Press on behalf of The Past and Present Society Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/649995 The Conference proved divisive for English Catholics, since the invocation of resistance theory appeared treasonous to some. This point arose during the Appellant Controversy. The Jesuit inclusion of a Spanish claimant identified the work as pro-Spanish.Cyndia Susan Clegg, \\"By the Choise and Inuitation of al the Realme\\": Richard II and Elizabethan Press Censorship, Shakespeare Quarterly Vol. 48, No. 4 (Winter, 1997), pp. 432-448, at pp. 438‚Äì9. Published by: Folger Shakespeare Library in association with George Washington University. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2871253 Some lay Catholics and secular priests were strongly opposed to the work, as became manifest during the Controversy; and so the initial issue from about 1598, the appointment of an archpriest in England, became bound up with attitudes to the succession to the English throne. Later editions Persons produced a Latin version of the work, in 1597, with significant changes. It was based on the second half of the English original, with the addition of material on papal authority. A selection reprinted as Severall speeches at a conference concerning the power of parliament, to proceed against their king for misgovernment (1648/9) has been attributed to Henry Walker.

It appeared from 1884 to 1914. History 1892 poster by Jules Ch√©ret Poster by Adolphe Willette Under the direction of Jules Roques, Le Courrier fran√ßais became the most representative satirical organ of the time. Notable writers included Maurice Bouchor, Raoul Ponchon, Georges Montorgueil, Hugues Delorme and Jean Lorrain. Illustrators included Adolphe Willette, David Ossipovitch Widhopff, Jean-Louis Forain, Jules Ch√©ret, Hermann-Paul, Henri Pille and Pierre Jeannot. The magazine included sections on literature, fine arts, theater, medicine and finance. Until 1895 the newspaper represented the light and sarcastic spirit of fin de si√®cle Paris, and welcomed elite illustrators who met every evening at the Rat Mort caf√© in Montmartre. From 1885 Jules Roques welcomed the Incoh√©rents. Raoul Ponchon published his famous \\"rhymed Gazettes\\" there, satirical and light pieces on news items. Henri Pille presented the manners of the time from a middle-aged viewpoint. Adolphe Willette, responsible for illustrating most of the cover pages, was a lover of Montmartre and finely depicted Pierrots and Harlequins. From 1887 Jules Roques, Adolphe Willette and other artists organized the famous masked balls of Le Courrier. These were not designed as venues for showing off amusing costumes, but as meetings of groups of symbolic figures, illustrating a theme that was planned and announced in advance. These balls helped to revive the Paris Carnival, which had been interrupted after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the Siege of Paris and the bloody suppression of the Paris Commune. The preparatory drawings published in the Courier for these balls encouraged female participants to dress very lightly, which explains the success of the events. On 15 June 1888 Le Courrier organized the \\"children's ball\\". The jury included Jean Lorrain disguised as Saint John the Baptist, Henri Pille as a constable and Jean-Louis Forain as a policeman. The characters of the commedia dell'arte were fashionable: Pierrot, Pierrette, Harlequin and Punchinello. Pille was a favorite subject of Willette, another great illustrator of the time and contributor to the Revue illustr√©e and the Courrier. Le Courrier fran√ßais provoked the public with daring prints. The owner Jules Roques was always interested in commercial success, while Louis Legrand tried to give it a rustic and humanitarian aspect. The hopes raised by the Exposition Universelle of 1900 were disappointed. The tone of the journal changed with the arrival of Ren√© Georges Hermann-Paul, who attacked priests, businessmen and some of the customs of the time. Violent and ironic, he was not only the perfect illustrator of Octave Mirbeau, but also a righter of wrongs with his violent and bitter graphics. His pessimistic spirit resulted in a black art that evoked cruel scenes with acerbic captions. Le Courrier organized several sales of drawings by its employees at the H√¥tel Drouot, including one on 25 April 1904 and another on 27 January 1905 under the hammer of Raymond Pujos, auctioneer.

There was a Courrier fran√ßais in the days of the First French Empire edited by Louis Fran√ßois Auguste Cauchois-Lemaire, future editor of Le Nain jaune under the restoration.

His father, Patrick, worked as a laborer. He was educated in a local public school, St. Matthew's School and Treemont Seminary. Kennedy became a teacher at St. Matthew's High School at age 17 and then later became the principal. He entered St. Charles Borromeo Seminary to study for the priesthood and continued his studies in Rome at the Pontifical North American College. Kennedy was ordained a priest in Rome for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia on July 24, 1887 by Cardinal Lucido Parocchi, the Vicar General of Rome. After he returned to Pennsylvania, Kennedy joined the faculty at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary. He was named the Rector of the Pontifical North American College on June 14, 1901.Brann, Henry A., \\"American College, The, in Rome\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia, (Charles George Herbermann, ed.), Encyclopedia Press, 1907 Bishop Pope Pius X appointed him as the Titular Bishop of Hadrianopolis in Honoriade on December 16, 1907. He was consecrated a bishop by Cardinal Girolamo Maria Gotti, O.C.D., the Prefect of the Congregation for Propagation of the Faith, on December 29, 1907. The principal co-consecrators were Archbishop Patrick Riordan of San Francisco and Bishop William Giles, Rector of the English College in Rome. Archbishop Kennedy was given the personal title of Archbishop by Pope Benedict XV on June 17, 1915. At the same time he was changed to the titular see of Seleucia in Isauria. He died in Rome on August 28, 1917 at the age of 59, and was buried in the Cimitero Comunale Monumentale Campo Verano in Rome. Portrait In May 1907, whilst painting his first portrait of Pope Pius X, the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury completed the first of two portraits of Bishop Kennedy whom he had befriended. This bust-length oval portrait, described by the New York Evening Mail as 'warmly tinted and attractive', was exhibited in January and February 1908 at Knoedler's Gallery in New York, The Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., and in Philadelphia, before apparently being sent to Kennedy's two sisters, Theresa and Margaret, who apparently later gave it to the St. Charles Borromeo Seminary, Overbrook, Pennsylvania, where it hangs today outside the Eakins Room. M√ºller-Ury's second much-larger half-length standing portrait of Kennedy was executed in 1911 when he was in Rome painting Pope Pius X again (which he presented to the Catholic University in Washington, D.C.) and remains at the North American College in Rome's Graduate House.

Born in F√≥lya, Temes County (now Folea, Timi»ô County) in 1903 he became a founding member of the Romanian branch of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party, which later became the Social Democratic Party of Transylvania and Banat. A journalist by profession, his political outlook encompassed both a strong patriotism on behalf of Austria-Hungary's Romanians and a commitment to social democracy.Neagoe, p.110 He was elected to the party leadership at three successive congresses: Nagyszeben (Sibiu) (December 1906), Budapest (December 1910) and Arad (October 1913).Neagoe, p.111 Although he viewed the socialist movement mainly in terms of struggle between classes rather than nationalities, Jumanca insisted on separate Romanian structures because he believed the many Romanian workers of Transylvania and Hungary were hesitant to join Hungarian-led political and trade movements for fear of Magyarization. He saw Romanian-led party sections and unions as a way to educate workers about their own language and history while safeguarding against Magyarization.Andrew C. Janos, William B. Slottman, Revolution in Perspective: Essays on the Hungarian Soviet Republic of 1919, p.113. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1971, Near the end of World War I, on October 30, 1918, a Romanian council was created in Budapest with the goal of preparing the union of Transylvania with Romania. This body had six representatives from the Romanian National Party and six social democrats, among whom was Jumanca. Moreover, he was present at the assembly in Alba Iulia that proclaimed the union, delivering a speech to the crowd of over 100,000 in which he emphasized the devotion to the national cause of the workers' movement. The following day, he was elected to the region's provisional parliament and named by the interim government as minister for industry. The subsequent period witnessed negotiations for uniting the socialist movement in Romania's new provinces with that of the Old Kingdom, a process that culminated with a congress held in October 1920 that absorbed the socialists of Transylvania, Banat and Bukovina into the Socialist Party of Romania. Eight individuals from these provinces were included in the party's leadership, Jumanca among them. Meanwhile, Ioan Fluera»ô traveled to Moscow to make contact with the Comintern; his experience there led social democrats to reject any ties with Soviet Russia. Thus, in February 1921, the social democrats of Transylvania, Banat and Bukovina withdrew from the pro-Moscow executive of the Socialist Party and formed a provisional leadership, to which Jumanca was elected. In May 1921, the socialist movement underwent a split at the founding conference of the Romanian Communist Party. The following month, a Federation of Romanian Socialist Parties was created by, among others, Jumanca, Fluera»ô, Gheorghe Grigorovici, Ilie Moscovici and Constantin-Titel Petrescu; this was consolidated at a congress in August 1922. In May 1927, the Federation reorganized into the Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSDR), with Jumanca elected to its leadership. He continued to be elected to executive positions within the party at three subsequent congresses, in 1930, 1933 and 1936.Neagoe, p.112 Jumanca was among the social democrats elected to the Romanian Chamber of Deputies in 1928 and in 1931. Additionally, from 1932 to 1933, he was a member of the Cluj city council. In 1933, he was elected to the Senate, and he served until 1937. Although elected senator for Cluj County on November 29, it was not until the following February 1 that he was sworn in: the assassination of Ion G. Duca by the Iron Guard on December 29 seriously shook the political system. In the event, from the time he was seated until his term expired in November 1937, he was the only social democrat in the Romanian Parliament. In 1938, with the onset of the National Renaissance Front royal dictatorship of King Carol II, Jumanca was among those social democratic leaders who decided to work within the new system, hoping to improve the situation of the workers while aware of internal threats (the rise of the far- right) and external ones (irredentist demands that threatened to break up the country). Working within the country's social insurance department, neither he nor other social democrats practiced politics, but instead focused on helping the workers' guilds achieve their demands. On April 12, 1944, he had a meeting with Iuliu Maniu (the leader of the National Peasants' Party) and other socialists, where they discussed a possible program of collaboration. Unlike Grigorovici, Jumanca had not held a position in Carol's government; neither had he been in the king's parliament, as had Fluera»ô; nor had he even considered cooperating with the Ion Antonescu dictatorship at its onset. These considerations led the individuals who recreated the PSDR after King Michael's Coup of August 23, 1944, to elect Jumanca to the party leadership. In contrast, Grigorovici, Fluera»ô, LazƒÉr MƒÉgla»ôu and Ilie Mirescu were excluded for their past collaboration. Jumanca was a close ally of Titel Petrescu, whom he followed into the Independent Social Democratic Party after a split between pro- and anti-communist social democrats in March 1946. Along with other party leaders, the two were arrested in February 1948 by the authorities of the new Communist Romania. According to witnesses mentioned by historian Stelian Neagoe, Jumanca was killed by torture at Gherla prison, his body then transported to VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti prison in Bucharest, in order to hide the evidence of the crime.

She is known for her portraiture and Tuscan landscapes, most of which reside in the Pitti Palace‚Äôs Gallery of Modern Art collection in Florence. She has two self- portraits in the Vasari Corridor collection. Family influences Chaplin came from a family of painters and sculptors. Her mother was Marguerite de Bavier-Chauffour, a poet and sculptor. Her uncle was Charles Joshua Chaplin, a French painter and engraver. Charles Chaplin conducted art classes specifically for women at his studio. The American artist Mary Cassatt and the English artist Louise Jopling were among Charles Chaplin's students. He died when Elisabeth Chaplin was a baby. Early life In 1900 Elisabeth‚Äôs family moved to Italy, first to Piemonte and afterwards to Savona in Liguria. It was there that she started to teach herself to paint, with no formal training. When the Chaplin family took up residence at the Villa Rossi in Fiesole in 1905, Elisabeth had the chance to visit Francesco Gioli‚Äôs studio and meet painter Giovanni Fattori. Chaplin‚Äôs visits to the Uffizi Museum were decisive. She learned from copying the classics. From 1905-1908, she painted her first large canvases and in 1910 her \\"Ritratto di Famiglia\\" (Family Portrait) won a gold medal from the Florence Society of Fine Arts (displayed in the Gallery of Modern Art, Florence). In 1916 she moved with her family to Rome, where she would live until 1922. There she met Paul-Albert Besnard (1849-1934), a French painter and printmaker, who in 1913, was appointed to be the director of Villa Medici in Rome. He became one of Chaplin's mentors. She participated in the Venice Biennale in 1914 and in the Paris Salon in 1922 and thereafter. She befriended French author Andr√© Gide and followed painter Maurice Denis, founder of the Nabis movement, whom she met in Florence in 1912. Before World War II From 1922 to 1930s, Chaplin lived at Villa Il Treppiede with her mother and life-long companion Ida Capecchi. Her nephew Robert Chaplin, a young and promising artist, lived with them from 1927 until his death from muscular dystrophy at age eleven in 1937. Chaplin produced numerous portraits and frescoes during this time. She socialized with painters Giovanni Fattori and Luigi and Francesco Gioli, and art collector Bernard Bereson. Return to France From the mid 1930s until the early 1950s, Chaplin lived in Paris. She received civil commissions to produce decorative tapestries such as Summer and Autumn for the √âcole Professionelle of Metz, France (1936‚Äì37) and murals for Paris churches Notre-Dame-du Salut and Saint-Esprit. In 1937, she won a gold medal at the International Exhibition in Paris and in 1938, she was awarded the French Legion of Honor. Return to Tuscany She returned to Villa Il Treppiede in Fiesole after the war and moved back permanently in the early 1950s. She continued to paint landscapes and portraits, many of family members and loved ones. In 1946, the Uffizi Gallery acquired three of her paintings and requested a donation from the artist of her young Self-portrait with a Green Umbrella that now hangs in the Vasari Corridor. During her lifetime there a number of major retrospectives in Florence of her work: Palazzo Strozzi (1946), Academy of Arts and Design (1956), and French Institute (1965). Several of her works are on display in the national Gallery of Modern Art in Rome. Chaplin donated her entire body of works (and those of her mother and nephew) to Florence. Fifteen of her paintings are on show at Palazzo Pitti's Modern Art Gallery, while almost 700 (paintings and sketches) are in storage. She died in Fiesole in 1982.

Following her 1975 graduation from Harvard College, she worked briefly as a bilingual (French-English) reporter on the Ottawa Citizen in Ottawa, Ontario. She had a 23-year career with The Wall Street Journal, which included reporting stints in Toronto, Detroit, Washington, D.C. and three years as bureau chief in Atlanta. In 1983, she became the second Wall Street Journal correspondent in China. In 1987, she shared with her Journal colleagues a Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for her work on how public health officials mischaracterized the AIDS epidemic in order to secure more public funding and financial support. In 1998, she left the Journal to become a managing editor at The Oregonian, a regional newspaper owned by the Newhouse chain and headed by the pioneer journalist, Sandra Mims Rowe. At the Oregonian, she headed the creation of investigative projects. Among the projects she led was a year-long investigation of the $1 billion local asset manager, Capital Consultants, that led to the September 2000, suit by the Securities and Exchange Commission against the firm and its principal Jeffrey Grayson. The project was reported by veteran investigative reporters Jeff Manning and Jim Long. Bennett also led the Oregonian in an investigation of the Immigration and Naturalization Service that won the paper the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. In September 2001, she became editor of The Lexington Herald-Leader, a Knight Ridder paper. Twenty months later on June 2, 2003, Knight Ridder appointed her the first female editor in the 174-year history of their flagship paper, The Philadelphia Inquirer. In November 2006, Bennett stepped down as the Inquirer's editor. From November 2006 to June 2013, she was executive editor at Bloomberg News, where she created and ran a global team of investigative reporters and editors. She was also a co-founder, with journalist Lisa Kassenaar, of Bloomberg News' Women's project. Under her direction, a team of Bloomberg journalists for the first time tallied the personal assets of family members of a senior Chinese leader ‚Äì vice president Xi Jinping. The story, which was widely circulated both inside and outside China, won the Polk Award, and also resulted in Bloomberg's business in China being significantly disrupted. She resigned from Bloomberg News in November 2013. Bennett has also been a freelance journalist and public speaker, and she has spoken at TED on journalism and end-of-life care. In 2016, she was named the 29th director of Voice of America. In mid-June 2020, as the Trump administration replaced VOA's parent agency director with conservative filmmaker Michael Pack, Bennett announced her resignation.

It became the forerunning blueprint for the eventual US-USSR Trade and Economic Council which was formally established in October 1973. Origins The Council for American‚ÄìSoviet Trade (CAST) was initially proposed in February 1973 following the highly successful US-Soviet Trade Conference organized by the NAM in Washington at the Shoreham Hotel.U.S.-Soviet Trade Conference Proceedings, NAM (September 1975) pp. 66-72 With over 800 delegates and a high-level Soviet delegation led by Vice Minister of Foreign Trade V.S. Alkhimov, this conference was the largest gathering of its kind. CAST was designed in response to an official protocol which emerged from President Nixon's summit with Soviet premier Leonid Breznev during the Soviet leader's visit to Washington in June 1973. NAM's East-West Task Force had hosted a luncheon for Soviet Foreign Trade Minister N.S. Patolichev at the Washington International Club on June 22 during the Summit which reinforced the prominent role of NAM in the development of a permanent organizational mechanism. Soviet leadership had been impressed by NAM's follow-up including a June 1 meeting in New York City between Nicholas E. Hollis, NAM'-IEA's vice president and members of the East‚ÄìWest Task Force and Soviet deputy foreign trade minister V. Smeljakov where the CAST proposal was initially presented in writing with diagrams and proposed functions, including dual secretariat offices in Moscow and New York.Letter, Nicholas Hollis, NAM to Donald M.Kendall, chairman and chief executive officer, Pepsico (April 26, 1973)Letter, Donald M.Kendall, chairman and chief executive officer, Pepsico to E.D.

NAM's cautionary, qualified endorsement for exploring trade openings with the USSR contrasted with Chase Manhattan Bank's David Rockefeller, who pressed for wider export credit support and broader trade liberalization with the Soviets. NAM mission to USSR: gamesmanship finale V.S. Alkhimov subsequently extended an invitation Letter, V.S. Alkhimov, Vice Minister for Foreign Trade/USSR to Burt F. Raynes, chairman, NAM, (May 22, 1973) to visit the Soviet Union to NAM President E.D. Kenna, vice president N.E. Hollis and honorary chairman Burt F. Raynes (also chairman of Rohr Industries in Chula Vista, California).

It allows instructors to create and manipulate presentations in a wide variety of contexts that can enhance student‚Äôs interest and engagement (Mills & Roblyer, 2006). In addition, it helps instructors clearly identify the main points of a topic or activity while still providing the details through presentation (Loisel & Galer, 2004). Instructors can incorporate multiple types of media formats (e.g., diagram, photo, drawing, sound and video) that cannot be easily integrated together into one single medium. PowerPoint also provides graphical, transactional, aesthetic and interactive features. PowerPoint is for use in the classroom, and needs to be paired with use of an LCD projector and large screen.

It is dated by mainstream scholars to the early or the mid-4th Dynasty (2613-2494 BC) during the Old Kingdom period. The pyramid owner is not known for certain and most Egyptologists, such as Miroslav Verner, think it should be a king known under his hellenized name, Bikheris, perhaps from the Egyptian Baka. On the contrary, Wolfgang Helck and other egyptologists doubt this attribution.  Research history  The first descriptions of the monument were made between 1842 and 1846 by the German egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius. He investigated the main shaft and its surroundings and marked the pyramid in his pioneering list as \\"Pyramid XIII\\".Miroslav Verner: Die Pyramiden. Rowohlt-Taschenbuch-Verlag, Reinbek 1999, , p. 270-272.Karl Richard Lepsius: Denkm√§ler aus √Ñgypten und √Ñthiopien. Nicolaische Buchhandlung, Berlin 1849, p. 29. The pyramid shaft was examined more closely in 1904-1905 by the Italian archaeologist Alessandro Barsanti. Gaston Maspero, then director- general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities of Egypt, visited Barsanti's excavations and was struck by the monumental size of the construction. He writes:Alexandre Barsanti, Gaston Maspero: Fouilles de Zaoui√©t el-Ary√¢n (1904-1905), Annales du service des antiquit√©s de l'√âgypte (ASAE) 7 (1906), pp. 257-286, available online copyright-free Barsanti undertook further work on the site in 1911-1912 but the First World War brought all excavations to a halt and Barsanti died in 1917. As a consequence, nothing happened on the site until 1954 when a set was needed for the epic film Land of the Pharaohs. The landscape of Zawyet El Aryan seemed to be the perfect place and the pyramid of Baka was chosen as a backdrop for the movie. Consequentlty, the shaft and its surroundings were cleared from the sand and rubbles which had covered the area since Barsanti's excavations.Rainer Stadelmann: Die √Ñgyptischen Pyramiden: vom Ziegelbau zum Weltwunder ( = Kulturgeschichte der antiken Welt, vol. 30). von Zabern, Mainz 1985, , p. 77, 140-145. Since 1964 the pyramid of Baka lies within a military restricted area. Consequently, no excavations are allowed, the necropolis surrounding the pyramid is overbuilt with military bungalows and the shaft is misused as a local dump. Thus, the status of the shaft is now uncertain and most likely disastrous.Roman Gundacker: Zur Struktur der Pyramidennamen der 4. Dynastie. In: Sokar, vol. 18, 2009. , p. 26‚Äì30.  Description  Floor plan of the pyramid of Baka. Burial chamber with the oval sarcophagus (1905 photography). ;Location The pyramid of Baka is located in the Northern sector of Zawyet El Aryan, around south-west of Giza, in the North-Eastern corner of the military restricted area. ;Superstructure Next to nothing is known about the superstructure of the pyramid as indeed only the square base, made of natural bedrock, was finished. It measures and shows traces of a surrounding pedestal, preserved for the limestone covering. The exact planned size and slope cannot be evaluated because no covering blocks nor any pyramidion were ever found and pyramid pedestals were always larger than the base of the pyramid itself. Thus, it cannot be excluded that the planned size of the pyramid could have been noticeably smaller. ;Substructure The substructure consists of a T-shaped shaft, the corridor of which is on a South to North axis and the chamber on an East to West axis. The complete shaft has no remaining ceiling and it is possible that it never had any. A steep stairway leads down to the chamber. At half its length the stairway is interrupted by a horizontal surface of unknown purpose. The shaft walls are smooth but were never covered with stones and the chamber was never completed. Only the floor of the chamber was finished and covered with massive granite blocks, each being long and thick and weighing up to 9 tons each. Close to the Western end of the chamber an unusual vat was discovered. It has an oval shape and was embedded into one of the stone blocks constituting the chamber floor. It seems that the vat was brought into the chamber some time during the construction of the foundations since it is too big to fit through the passageway leading to the chamber. The vat is long, broad and deep. The oval lid was found in situ, indicating that the vat was found sealed. According to Barsanti, small traces of a substance were found inside the vat, but unfortunately they were never examined closer and today they are lost. Furthermore, Barsanti claims to have found a damaged dedication tablet with the name of king Djedefre on it. ;Pyramid complex The alignment of the pyramid complex is very similar to that of the pyramid of Djedefre. It consisted of a enclosure wall within which the mortuary temple should have been located. However, since the first layer of the pyramid was never even started, the surrounding complex was also left unfinished and there are no traces of a mortuary temple, a causeway, a valley temple or any other cultic building.

Egyptologists and historians continue to debate the dating of the pyramid of Baka. They point to several graffiti made of black and red ink, which were found in the chamber and in the descending stairway. Alessandro Barsanti recorded at least 67 inscriptions. They record the names of different workmen crews as well as the name of the planned pyramid complex: Seba ?-Ka, meaning \\"The Star of ?-Ka\\". The workmen crew whose name appears most often ‚Äî thus being the leading crew during the building works ‚Äî was Wer-ef-seba ?-Ka, meaning \\"Great Like the Star of (King) ?-Ka\\". Inscription No.35 gives the name Neferka-Nefer (meaning \\"His Beautiful Ka is Flawless\\"), but otherwise lacks any reference to known people from the 4th Dynasty. Graffiti No.15 and No.52 also mention an interesting royal name: Nebkar√¢, meaning \\"Lord of the Ka of R√¢\\". It is unknown if this is actually the name of a yet unknown king or that of a prince. A further inscription, No.55, mentions a possible Gold name: Neb hedjet-nwb, meaning \\"Lord of the Golden Crown\\". Some egyptologists propose that this is either the Horus name of king Huni or the Gold name of king Nebka. This, however, would implicate that the pyramid was built during the late 3rd Dynasty rather than the 4th. ;Name of the king Red-ink inscription with the name of the crews of workmen, 1905 drawing by A. Barsanti. The main problem is the correct reading of the cartouche name found within at least six ink inscriptions. Whilst the lower and therefore second hieroglyphic sign is certainly a Ka-symbol, the first sign is illegible. Unfortunately the excavator, Alessandro Barsanti made no facsimiles of the inscriptions and made rather slipshod hand-drawings instead, so that the first hieroglyph remains indecipherable.Miroslav Verner: Archaeological Remarks on the 4th and 5th Dynasty Chronology. In: Archiv Orient√°ln√≠, vol. 69. Praha 2001, page 363‚Äì418. As a consequence there are several alternative readings of the cartouche name: Kurt Sethe reads Nebka (\\"His Ka is the lord\\"), Jean-Philippe Lauer reads Bik- Ka (\\"his Ka is divine\\"), Peter Kaplony reads Schena-Ka (\\"his Ka is forceful\\") and Gaston Maspero reads Nefer-Ka (\\"his Ka is beautiful/flawless\\").Nabil M.A. Swelim: Some Problems on the History of the Third Dynasty (= Archaeological and historical studies, vol. 7).

G√∂ttinger Miszellen, G√∂ttingen 1989. page 66. J√ºrgen von Beckerath and George Reisner instead think that the pyramid was planned as the tomb for a well attested prince of the 4th Dynasty named Baka, a son of king Djedefre. Baka's name is written with the hieroglyphs of a ram together with the Ka-symbol. Beckerath assumes that Baka changed his name into Bakar√™ (\\"Soul and Ka of R√¢\\") when he ascended the throne but then died unexpectedly, leaving nothing more than an unfinished tomb shaft. Thus, Beckerath and Reisner read the mysterious name at Zawyet El Aryan as Ba-Ka (\\"His Ka is his Ba\\").J√ºrgen von Beckerath: Chronologie des pharaonischen √Ñgypten. Die Zeitbestimmung der √§gyptischen Geschichte von der Vorzeit bis 332 v. Chr.

Aidan Dodson instead sees a sitting Seth-animal and therefore reads the name found in the pyramid as Seth-Ka (\\"Seth is my Ka\\"). He believes that the pyramid was planned as the tomb of prince Setka, another son of king Djedefre. Dodson doubts the reading \\"Baka\\" and wonders why the cartouche name at Zawyet El Aryan contains no sun-hieroglyph when it was meant to be addressed to the sun god.Aidan Dodson: On the date of the unfinished pyramid of Zawyet el-Aryan. In: Discussion in Egyptology (DiE), vol. 3, Oxford 1985, p. 21‚Äì24.Aidan Dodson, Dyan Hilton: The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. The American University in Cairo Press, London 2004, , page 61. Either way, both theories, if correct, would place the pyramid of Baka firmly in the 4th Dynasty. Supporting this datation, von Beckerath, Reisner and Dodson point to the architectural features of the burial shaft, in particular the use of hewn granite blocks for bases in such sizes occurs no earlier than the reign of Khufu. Additionally, according to Barsanti, fragments of a similar oval sarcophagus were found in the ruins of the pyramid of Djedefre. Furthermore, von Beckerath, Reisner and Dodson point to the dedication tablet of Djedefre allegedly found by Barsanti near the stairway of the pyramid of Baka as a proof of its 4th Dynasty date. Kurt Sethe, Nabil M.A. Swelim and Wolfgang Helck contradict the former arguments and date the shaft to the late 3rd Dynasty. They point out that, in general, the use of hewn granite as a floor covering in royal tombs was a tradition since the reign of king Khasekhemwy, the last pharaoh of 2nd Dynasty. Furthermore, the tradition of building shaft- like tombs beneath a pyramid was a tradition of the 3rd Dynasty, not of the 4th Dynasty. The alignment of the pyramid complex on a South to North axis was also a common during the 3rd Dynasty. Additionally, W. Helck and Eberhard Otto point out, that the design similarities between the pyramid of Baka and that of Djedefre might be striking, but the design of Djedefre's pyramid was atypical for the 4th Dynasty anyway. Thus, to use Djedefre's tomb design as a comparison argument cannot confirm a 4th Dynasty datation. Finally, egyptologists doubt the evaluations of Barsanti concerning the size of the pyramid base. They think that the pyramid was not so big as Lepsius and Barsanti evaluated. They also doubt the finding of Djedefre's dedication tablet, because this artifact was never published.Wolfgang Helck, Eberhard Otto: Lexikon der √Ñgyptologie, vol. 5. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1984, , p. 310, 497-498.

The artists are licensed by the San Francisco Arts Commission and are only allowed to sell work that has been \\"predominantly created or significantly altered in form\\" by the street artist. The Arts Commission currently licenses approximately 400 street artists, whose licensing fees cover all program costs.Street Artists Bluebook (2008), pp. 9, 11. The program generates an estimated $4 million annually for the city's economy.\\"World Class Art for A World Class City\\", San Francisco Arts Commission brochure, 2011, p. 6. The program was the result of a hard-fought political battle by street artists who were sometimes harassed and arrested by police for selling their work on the city's sidewalks. In response, street artists strategically organized by forming their own guild, hiring a lawyer, and drafting two ballot initiatives in order to create laws that enabled them to sell their work in public places. Some street artists were willing to be arrested time and again in order to draw media attention to their cause and to push for a change in existing laws.  History  During the 1960s, California was the site of many outdoor art fairs, which nurtured a culture of independent artists and craftspersons. At this time there was an effort to sell crafts on the sidewalks of the liberal Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco. Artists and street performers who illegally set up in public areas were frequently harassed and arrested by the police. In the 700 block of Beach Street adjacent to Victorian Park and near Fisherman's Wharf, between 15 and 25 artists would set up their displays and use lookouts to alert them to the arrival of the police.  1971  Following the February 6, 1971 arrest of several street artists, including William Clark, in the 700 block of Beach Street, a first attempt was made to organize the street artists. Under the direction of Warren Garrick (Nettles), a sculptor-painter who would become the group's \\"chief spokesman\\",\\"A Raucous Hearing on Artists' Bid\\", San Francisco Chronicle (11 August 1972), p. 1, 18. the San Francisco Street Artists Guild was formed.\\"Photographs of San Francisco Street Artist Guild's Stonestown Shopping Center Show\\", \\"Combined Sunday edition of the SF Chronicle and the SF Examiner\\" (3 October 1971) p. ?. The Guild hired a lawyer, Peter Keane, and began to develop a \\"political strategy\\" to manage interactions with the police and with local retail merchants.\\"Street Artists vs. Law ‚Äì It's Not a Pretty Picture\\", San Francisco Chronicle (2 April 1971), p. 3. Keane and street-art activists noted that artists who were arrested for illegally selling their work on San Francisco's sidewalks were being charged with peddling without a license - although the city's laws contained a provision to issue peddlers' permits. However, the police department, which oversaw the granting of peddlers‚Äô permits, was unwilling to issue any new permits, and it was revealed that only two sellers had been granted peddlers‚Äô permits since 1969.\\"Street Artists Attorney Testifies\\", San Francisco Chronicle (3 December 1971), p. 9 Keane and the activists realized that the city had placed itself in a difficult position by arbitrarily denying access to a provision within the city charter, and prepared to legally exploit that vulnerability. In April the street artists staged a couple of protests at city hall and at Mayor Joseph Alioto's office while carrying a coffin, which symbolized the death of their incomes as a result of frequent police arrests.\\"City Hall Protest By Street Artists\\", San Francisco Chronicle (15 April 1971), p. 2. The protests garnered news coverage and Alioto promised to speak to the police chief about a solution for the permits, and afterward schedule talks with the artists' organizers.\\"Alioto, Friend of the Artists\\", San Francisco Chronicle (16 April 1971), p. 26. During those later dialogues with Mayor Alioto, Garrick suggested that the city should consider a separate licensing system for artists who sell their own creations, and provide designated selling areas for those licensed artists.\\"Street Artists Meet the Mayor\\", San Francisco Chronicle (24 April 1971), p. 33. Alioto was not resistant to the proposal, the talks went well, and Garrick left the meetings feeling that there would be a moratorium on the arrests. However, later in May when the talks began to stall, Garrick realized that no real progress was being made with the mayor and the police chief.\\"Street Artists To Dramatize Police Beefs\\", San Francisco Chronicle (8 May 1971), p. 28. The artists then acquired a temporary state park permit allowing them to sell in Victorian Park.\\"S.F. Street Artists Are Arrested\\", San Francisco Chronicle (17 May 1971), p. 2. At the end of the afternoon, when the permit expired, they moved their wares from the park to the nearby sidewalks of Beach Street, the police made arrests, and the moratorium was officially over. When the arrested artists were arraigned before Judge Axelrod, he commented that he \\"thought that the code section was unconstitutional\\" because the law sets no clear standards for licensing and makes no provision for fair hearings on permit applications.\\"Judge's Boost for S.F. Street Artists\\", San Francisco Chronicle (18 May 1971), p. 3.\\"More Peddler Busts\\", San Francisco Chronicle (20 September 1971), p. 2. Recognizing the city's legal jeopardy, the Guild's organizers recruited the ACLU and lawyer Robert Kantor to file suit against the city over the arrests, because the city had given \\"absolute and unguided discretion to the license granting authority which consistently and systematically denies permits to artists and musicians\\".\\"ACLU Move For Street Artists\\", San Francisco Chronicle (29 June 1971), p. 5. The Guild further contended that such works - when sold on public sidewalks - are expressions of art protected under the First Amendment.\\"License Suit Lost By Street Artists\\", San Francisco Chronicle (15 December 1971), p. 7\\"New Artists' Court Plea\\", San Francisco Chronicle (12 April 1974), p. 4. In September, as a result of the ACLU lawsuit, a Superior Court judge issued a restraining order that prohibited the police from arresting artists who sold their work on the sidewalks.\\"Order Halts Arrests of Artists\\", San Francisco Chronicle (25 September 1971), p. 2. However, the police did not halt the ongoing arrests, and in October, Judge Ira Brown issued an injunction and scolded the police for ignoring the restraining order.\\"S.F. Artists Win Case ‚Äì Again\\", San Francisco Chronicle (15 October 1971), p. 1, 24. That injunction meant that any police officer who arrested a street artist could be fined or jailed by Judge Brown. Word quickly spread of the new legal privilege and hundreds of new street artists, as well as opportunists, came to the sidewalks of crowded Union Square to sell their wares during the busy Christmas season.\\"Fair Weather Peddlers\\", San Francisco Chronicle (25 October 1971), p. 4.\\"Peddlers' Ordinance Hearing Ends\\", San Francisco Chronicle (7 December 1971), p. 4. The flood of new street artists and other sellers who could now operate with no regulations or enforcement created an environment of chaos, and fights occasionally broke out over the selection of selling spaces. An Ad Hoc Committee Against Street Vendors, formed by San Francisco businessman Cyril Magnin, branded the sidewalk selling scene as a public safety hazard. The disorder and violence that prevailed in December foreshadowed a continuing and grave liability for this and any other street artists program: Without regulation and an enforcement strategy, any street artists program could easily be infiltrated by opportunists who would make money their sole priority, drastically lower the quality of products, sell commercially manufactured items, and occasionally resort to intimidation or violence during selling-space selection.\\"Alioto Offers Space For Street Artists\\", San Francisco Chronicle (1 January 1972), p. 3. On December 15 another Superior Court judge overruled the injunction, declaring that the peddlers' ordinance was not unconstitutional, and that the police could continue with the arrests. With less than ten days before the end of the Christmas retail season, Mayor Alioto instructed police to stop the arrests and only issue warnings.\\"Street Artist Crackdown Is Canceled\\", San Francisco Chronicle (23 December 1971), p. 1, 18. The arrests and legal efforts of 1971 attracted enough media attention that a member of the San Francisco Arts Commission, Ray Taliaferro, expressed his desire that the Arts Commission should support legislation to license and regulate street artists and street musicians.\\"Peddlers Face Arrest\\", San Francisco Chronicle (22 December 1971), p. 3. In December, Taliaferro declared to the media, \\"I hate to see the street artists and musicians run out of the city. This is a significant artistic revolution we see going on. The city should do what it can to encourage these people\\".  1972  In January 1972 Alioto proposed that artists should be licensed and regulated by some city agency, and he granted the three requested areas where street artists could sell: inside Union Square on weekends, on the 700 block of Beach Street on Sundays, and at Embarcadero Plaza full-time. City Supervisor Quentin Kopp, responding to pressure from downtown merchants, questioned the mayor's authority to initiate such a program.\\"Kopp Queries Decision on Street Artists\\", San Francisco Chronicle (11 January 1972), p. 3. Two other Supervisors, Terry Francois and Robert Mendelson, introduced a resolution that would allow artists to acquire permits, allow the Supervisors to select selling locations, and have the artists' peers judge whether or not their products were of their own creation.\\"New Street Artists Law Introduced\\", San Francisco Chronicle (25 January 1972), p. 3. It was essential to Alioto and the Supervisors that artists would only be \\"selling their own work, not commercial products purchased from wholesalers\\". Alioto and the Supervisors felt that allowing the sale of commercially manufactured items would put the street artists in unfair competition with storeowners, who must also include their rental costs and employee salaries within their prices. Kopp followed by submitting his own resolution to the Board of Supervisors. Under Kopp's plan, the program would be run by a chief administrator, and the Board of Supervisors would determine who should receive a license and where the artists would be allowed to sell. Kopp also suggested that the price of a license should be minimal, being between $48 and $100 a year.\\"Kopp Plan For Vendor Licenses\\", San Francisco Chronicle (1 February 1972), p. 2. In March the Board of Supervisors approved a proposal to have street artists receive their licenses through the San Francisco Arts Commission, which would have a committee evaluate if the work was of the artist's own creation and not a commercially manufactured product.\\"New Rules for Street Artists\\", San Francisco Chronicle (24 March 1972), p. 4. Street artist representatives Garrick and Clark were named as chairman and secretary, respectively, of the screening committee.\\"The Street Artist Hassle Worsens\\", San Francisco Chronicle (16 December 1972), p. 6. The Board of Supervisors reserved the right to choose selling locations for the artists.\\"A Tentative Accord on Sites for Street Artists\\", San Francisco Chronicle (8 March 1972), p. 5. Not all members of the Arts Commission were receptive to the proposal. Commissioner Alec Yuill complained that the new responsibilities would be a \\"demeaning imposition. A matter of public nuisance, not of artistic judgment\\". Commissioners Taliaferro and Ruth Asawa did support the artists and the creation of a street artists' program.\\"Agency Discusses The Street Artists\\", San Francisco Chronicle (4 April 1972), p. 15. From the street artists' point of view, the sole area which the Board of Supervisors approved for selling - Embarcadero Plaza - was the least desirable of the three originally proposed selling areas,\\"Curb Voted on Street Artists\\", San Francisco Chronicle (28 March 1972), p. 6. since there was little foot traffic in the area. The artists' organizers continued to schedule meetings before the Board of Supervisors in an attempt to include the 700 block of Beach Street and downtown selling locations as well. They met stiff resistance from Supervisors Dianne Feinstein, Pete Tamaras, and Terry Francois, who were reluctant to approve any selling areas without the approval of the downtown merchants association. By this time the merchants and retail stores had become very organized and inflexible concerning the issue of additional selling areas.\\"The Street Artist Dispute Exhumed\\", San Francisco Chronicle (17 March 1972), p. 3. At an August Board of Supervisors meeting, Garrick and Clark protested the inflexibility of the Supervisors by refusing to leave the podium, and were arrested for disturbing the peace. Frustrated with the impasse over additional selling areas, the two resigned from the screening committee in December and many newly licensed artists risked arrest and went back to selling illegally on the 700 block of Beach Street and on the downtown sidewalks.  1973  In 1972 and 1973 the Street Artists Guild made nine appeals to the Board of Supervisors for viable selling spaces before deciding to submit a ballot initiative directly to the voters.\\"S.F. Street Artist' New Tactic\\", San Francisco Chronicle (19 April 1973), p. 7. Under the state constitution, laws can be enacted directly by citizens via a ballot initiative process and the approval of a majority of voters during an election. Clark authored a ballot initiative called Proposition J,\\"Street Artists Seeking a Legal Status\\", San Francisco Chronicle (8 July 1973), p. 2. which would require about 12,500 signatures of registered voters in order to qualify for placement on the ballot in an upcoming election.  1974  Clark and other street artists gathered 26,000 signatures for Proposition J, which was included on the ballot in the municipal election of June 1974. The initiative passed by a margin of 53.4% to 46.5%, with 80,991 votes in favor and 70,418 votes against.\\"Tally of S.F. Vote\\", San Francisco Chronicle (6 June 1974), p. 4. Under Proposition J, street artists were allowed to sell their wares virtually anywhere on the city's sidewalks. The new arts program attracted hundreds of new artists to San Francisco‚Äôs sidewalks, and by December 1974, 1,500 street artists would be licensed. In September, a few months after the ballot initiative passed, the downtown merchants association began to complain that the sidewalks had become flooded with street sellers, and that their displays created \\"wall-to-wall street artists\\" who \\"seriously hamper pedestrian traffic\\".\\"The S.F. Street Artist Mess\\", San Francisco Chronicle (20 September 1974), p. 4. In the beginning of December, the police, carrying out new Fire Department rules, began to clear many street artists out of the downtown area. Their explanation was that the artists and their displays were blocking fire hydrants and store exits.\\"Crackdown On Street Artists\\", San Francisco Chronicle (6 December 1974), p. 1. Though the artists left quietly after police warnings, the Street Artists Guild said it would challenge the police crackdown in court. The next day, an appeals court judge issued a writ of mandate that temporarily blocked the enforcement of the new Fire Department rules until a hearing by Judge Ira Brown would be held in Superior Court.\\"Street Artists Gain Time\\", San Francisco Chronicle (7 December 1974), p. 1. At the same time, the Guild's lawyer set up a meeting with the artists to create a system of self- regulation, in an attempt to keep them out of the courts. Without any regulation or enforcement, selling spaces were acquired on a first-come, first-served basis. So many artists decided to sell near the popular downtown areas that some had to show up as early as 3 am in order to get a good selling space for the day. Eventually some sellers began to guard their selling spaces overnight.\\"Artists Meet Supervisors ‚Äì It's Friendly\\", San Francisco Chronicle (22 November 1975), p. 2. Frustrated with the congestion caused by street artists, the Board of Supervisors passed a new ordinance, sponsored by Kopp, which sharply reduced the number of selling locations by specifying that an artist's display must be on a sidewalk that was wide enough to allow a wide pedestrian walkway.\\"New S.F. Limits On Street Artists\\", San Francisco Chronicle (24 December 1974), p. 1. Since many sidewalks were not wide enough to satisfy the width requirement, the ordinance effectively eliminated 98% of selling spaces granted by Proposition J. The street artists' concerns over the restrictions of the Kopp Ordinance were eased by the fact that the ordinance was likely to be challenged in court by the Guild's lawyers, because it conflicted with the provisions of Proposition J.\\"Ordinance on Street Artist Rules Stalled\\", San Francisco Chronicle (31 December 1974), p. 4.\\"Artists Busted as Trumpet Blasts\\", San Francisco Chronicle (29 May 1975), p. 1. 1975 The Kopp Ordinance was approved by the Board of Supervisors in January 1975.\\"Board Approves The Vendor Law\\", San Francisco Chronicle (7 January 1975), p. 5 For the first half of 1975 the artists grudgingly sold within the Kopp Ordinance's restrictions, but by May many artists chose to protest the new ordinance by violating its provisions and selling in \\"undesignated areas\\", choosing to be arrested and jailed rather than simply signing a police citation and going home. In June the Board of Supervisors, sensing the vulnerability of the Kopp Ordinance within the courts, decided to write its own street artists ballot initiative called Proposition L, which would repeal Proposition J.\\"Tougher Law on Vendors Sought\\", San Francisco Chronicle (10 December 1974), p. 5. (By law, a voter-approved ballot initiative cannot be overturned by the Board of Supervisors, only by another ballot initiative.) Proposition L would set up a stricter system of artist regulations, registration, and inspection. It would also give the Board of Supervisors power to regulate selling locations.\\"News Furor Grows On Street Artists\\", San Francisco Chronicle (6 June 1975), p. 2. State Senator George Moscone, at the time a candidate for mayor, sided with the street artists in opposing Proposition L. He stated, \\"The attempts to harass them off the streets of our city and to circumvent the will of the people as expressed through their approval of Proposition J are, to me, terribly wasteful\\". Moscone would later become mayor and demonstrate a very supportive position for the Street Artists Program. In 1976, when the street artists nearly lost all their downtown selling spaces after the Board of Supervisors voted to permanently remove them, Moscone's mayoral veto preserved those selling spaces for decades to come.\\"Moscone Vetoes Move To Limit Street Artists\\", San Francisco Chronicle (17 July 1976), p. 4. The street artists responded to the threat of Proposition L by drafting their own, new ballot initiative for the November 1975 election, called Proposition M.\\"Artists Rebel at City Hall\\", San Francisco Chronicle (15 July 1975), p. 4. Proposition M further limited the power of the Board of Supervisors over selling-space selection while setting forth provisions for fire and safety regulations that would ease sidewalk congestion.\\"Artist' Street Sales Petition\\", San Francisco Chronicle (7 August 1975), p. 3. In an effort to appease the merchant community, Proposition M called for reducing the number of artists around Union Square by 75%, implementing a system to insure that artists make what they sell, and limiting the number of artists in a given region by using a lottery system to equally share designated selling spaces. To the disappointment of the artists, Proposition M failed and Proposition L became law during the November election. To date, the ordinance defined by Proposition L is still the current law which sets forth the procedures and privileges of the Street Artists Program of San Francisco. After the passage of Proposition L, street art activists met with the Board of Supervisors to resolve which selling areas would be designated for them. The Board of Supervisors granted 21 selling regions in the Union Square area, on Market Street, at Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf, and on Beach Street near Ghirardelli Square.\\"Supervisors Allow 21 Artist Locations\\", San Francisco Chronicle (25 November 1975), p. 4. It was also decided that the Public Works Department would mark off and number selling spaces on the sidewalk so the spaces could be equally shared among the artists, with a daily lottery for selling-space selection. Concerning the dangerous problem of artists guarding their selling spaces overnight, street artist Joy McCoskey reiterated the importance that no selling space should be occupied between the hours of midnight and 6 am. The downtown merchants seemed content with the new regulations and selling spaces. In early December the new ordinance went into effect, and 800 street artists bought licenses for a fee of $80 per year.\\"Where Street Artists Can Sell Their Crafts\\", San Francisco Chronicle (8 December 1975), p. 2.  Licensing  Street artists who are licensed by the San Francisco Arts Commission are only allowed to sell items that have been \\"predominately created or significantly altered in form\\" by the artist. The program strictly forbids the sale of commercially manufactured products. Screening committee Before a street artist license is granted, each artist must demonstrate to a screening committee that he or she did indeed create the product that he or she plans to sell.Street Artists Bluebook (2008), p. 23. During the screening of an artist's work, the artist must not only bring finished items which he or she has created, but must also bring raw source materials, show partially completed items, and show receipts for the raw materials of the product.Street Artists Bluebook (2008), pp. 23-24. The members of the screening committee can also ask that an artist create a piece in their presence. If committee members are still not satisfied that the work is of the artist's own creation, they can conduct an onsite visit to the artist‚Äôs workshop to verify the creation process.Street Artists Bluebook (2008), p. 24. The committee licenses street artists in a number of specific categories of arts and crafts, including bead making, bead stringing, button craft jewelry, candles, castings, ceramics, sculpture, coin cutting, computer- generated & new technology art, decoupage, doughcrafting, DVDs/cassette tapes/CDs, enameling, engraving, fabricated and/or cast jewelry, feather art, fiber art, found objects, glass art (blown glass and stained glass), kite making, lapidary, leathercraft (including belts and soft clothing), millinery, miscellaneous items, musical instruments, painting and drawing, paper and papier-m√¢ch√© jewelry, photography, pipes, plants and dried flowers, plastic and metal arts, printmaking, puppets and dolls, sewn items (including some puppets and dolls), shell jewelry, string sculpture, terrarium making, textile arts, toy making, and woodcraft.Street Artists Bluebook (2008), pp. 25-31. Licenses are not granted for street artists who produce or sell \\"food items, incense, perfumes, body oils, soaps, or other cosmetic products\\".Street Artists Bluebook (2008), p. 22. Street musicians and performers are not included in the ordinance. Violations and penalties Since it is not unusual for some street artists to sell items which they did not make, the program's rules have provisions for citing and penalizing artists who violate regulations.Street Artists Bluebook (2008), p. 84. Violations can be issued for selling commercially manufactured items, selling crafts that they were never screened to sell, and for selling handmade items not of their creation but made by another craftsperson - possibly by another street artist.Street Artists Bluebook (2008), p. 92. Violations can be reported not only by the police, but by the staff of the Art Commission, a storeowner, a member of the public, or even another street artist.Street Artists Bluebook (2008), p. 86. At various times, the Street Artists Program has hired individuals to work as Art Inspectors, patrolling the sidewalks looking for street artists whose items violate craft criteria, or who are in violation of other regulations. A subcommittee of the San Francisco Arts Commission, called the Street Artists Program Committee, meets once a month to deal with ongoing issues specific to the program as well as to hold hearings for street artists who have been cited for violating regulations, such as selling commercially manufactured items. If the Program Committee finds that an artist has violated regulations, the committee's members have the option to either suspend or revoke that street artist's license.Street Artists Bluebook (2008), p. 85. The initial formation of the Street Artists Program was dependent on a certain amount of cooperation from the merchant associations, especially in the designation of selling areas. If a street artists program develops a reputation that it is allowing commercially manufactured items, the very organized merchant community of retail stores will urge city government to limit or disable that program.\\"Street Artists Lose Another Sizzling Battle\\", San Francisco Chronicle (14 July 1972), p. 5.  Designated selling locations  Street artists are allowed to sell only in designated areas named within the original ordinance. Occasionally other locations are added by the Board of Supervisors.Street Artists Bluebook (2008), p. 33. The designated selling areas include: Fisherman's Wharf, the downtown financial district, the Cliff House, and Justin Herman Plaza. Unlike other public arts programs, such as Seattle‚Äôs Pike Place Market, San Francisco does not assign selling spaces by seniority. Daily lotteries and a selling-space signup procedure are held every morning to determine an assignment of selling spaces for that day.Street Artists Bluebook (2008), p. 39.

Community farming groups then grow these animals in simple mesh farming pens close to their village. Because sea cucumbers feed off the ocean floor, the growing process requires no food, just pen maintenance. After nine months sea cucumbers reach their full adult size and are sold to exporters for around US $2.50 each. This system links isolated communities to global markets and has been proven to raise income of farmers who make less than one-dollar fifty per day, by US $30 per month, nearly doubling their monthly income. This system combines economic growth with environmental sustainability and supply and demand.

International organizations and foreign investors have dominated this industry with financing, technical support and infrastructure development. Shrimp aquaculture in Madagascar has grown in importance over the years, and is responsible for the direct and indirect employment of over 3 000 people on the island. Shrimp farmed in Madagascar are high quality and sell at relatively high prices. Today, the shrimp export industry has difficulty competing with less costly shrimp from other areas such as Asia. One species of shrimp, from Madagascar, prized by shrimp farmers is Penaeus monodon. It is renowned for its size and quality and sells for up to three times as much as shrimp from other countries. Penaeus monodon is valued by consumers for both its taste and texture but it is too expensive to those whose purchase based on the price. Therefore, on price alone, shrimp products from Madagascar cannot compete in export markets. It is unknown whether they can compete in high-end niche markets, but it could be a marketing opportunity and solution to the crisis the industry now faces.http://www.unep.ch/etb/initiatives/Executive%20Summaries%20and%20briefs/Madagascar%20Ten%20Pager.pdf Integrated Assessment of Trade-related Policies and Biological Diversity in the Agricultural Sector in Madagascar Marine aquaculture in the northwest is dominated by giant tiger prawn farming near the mangrove areas which have been identified by the Madagascar Shrimp Aquaculture Development Master Plan (Sch√©ma d'am√©nagement pour l'aquaculture de crevettes √† Madagascar - SAACM). These farm areas are systems composed of breeding ponds, a hatchery, a processing and packaging factory and storage facilities.  Seaweed  Seaweed farming is practiced in the northeastern region of the island in conjunction with the IBIS Madagascar company. Harvesting is done in a coastal zone, usually by women and children.  Training and research  Training and research on aquaculture started in the 80s with the Marine Station of Toliara and enhanced by the implementation of the Fishery High Training Unit (UFSH: Unit√© de Formation Sup√©rieure Halieutique).RABENEVANANA, M. W. et RALIJAONA, C. LA FORMATION HALIEUTIQUE A MADAGASCAR. http://www.fao.org/docrep/field/003/ab825f/AB825F14.htm The Marine Station, established in 1961 near of the current Harbor of Toliara, has achieved many research mainly on coral reefs in the South West (Bay of Toliara and Bay of Ranobe), especially the Great Reef Toliara (GRT). Since 1972, with the gradual creation of the current University of Toliara, research has diversified and included fisheries. Several researchers and technicians have been trained, but at the time the need was more academic and pedagogical. With the UFSH project funded by FAO, it was extended to aquaculture. 40 fisheries scientists Engineers were trained with several specialties including fishery and aquaculture. Most of these engineers have strengthened the team of the Ministry for Fisheries and Agriculture, other contributed to the creation and development of the first shrimp farms in Madagascar (currently grouped in UNIMA). Two engineers were recruited by the Fishery and Marine Science Institute (IH.SM: Institut Halieutique et des Sciences Marines) to ensure following training of new technicians, managers and aquaculture, and new fisheries scientists Engineers (effective training of 20 new engineers in 2013). Both research and training entities have combined their structure to create in 1993, the current IH.SM. Since 1993, all training and research in fisheries and aquaculture are being provided by this Institute. With the adoption of the LMD system by the Universities of Madagascar, training is now grouped into 3 academic cycles: (1) License of the Sea and Littoral which include Biodiversity-Environment and Fisheries and Aquaculture options; (2) Masters in Applied Oceanography including several specializations and (3) PhD in Applied Oceanography. Research in these field are now welle diversified and performed by more than 30 researchers (PhD) and several PhD research Student. In recent years, skill levels in the Madagascar aquaculture industry have improved considerably. This has been largely due to the improvement efforts of IH.SM and the government created, in yearly 2000s the Ministry of Fishery and Marines resources. The implementation of non-profit NGO‚Äôs, such as MIDEM, which have become an integral part of the islands seafood industry has also enhanced the effectiveness of the development of fishery and aquaculture training in Madagascar. These NGOs especially focus their work on Aquaculture training programs based on prior experience and training for wild fisheries and marine farms. The Independent Mission for Development and Education in Madagascar (MIDEM) is an open, non-profit NGO in Madagascar aiming to provide a sustainable solution to the needs of the Malagasy population stricken by extreme poverty and social injustice on the East coast of Madagascar. MIDEM‚Äôs mission is to improve livelihoods by implementing projects on education, rural development including fish farming, entrepreneurship and social development.Network of Aquaculture Centers in Asia-Pacific. (NACA) (2013) FK Norway South-South Aquaculture Professional Exchange Programme.  Legislation and administration  Marine farmers usually look for sheltered and unpolluted waters rich in nutrients. Often these areas are also desirable for other purposes. In the late 1990s, demand for coastal aquaculture space increased. Aquaculture developed with the regional councils unsure of how marine farms might impact the delicate coastal environments. By early 2000, farmers/fishers and NGO‚Äôs were operating with inadequate regulations for managing the coast in a sustainable way. This lack of regulation lead to the creation of locally managed marine areas (LMMA). Harris A.

His work represents the beginnings of Antwerp Mannerism.Kim W. Woods. \\"Molder, Jan de.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 16 December 2016 Life Very little is known about the life of Jan de Molder. He was active in Antwerp and was brother-in-law of a prior of Averbode Abbey named Adriaen. Works of his hand survive in the Cluny Museum in Paris and in the churches of Botkyrka, Dilln√§s, Lofta and V√§sterl√∂vsta churches, Sweden. Work The artist is known only for the production of two carved altarpieces for the abbey of Averbode. The first one commissioned in 1513 is an altarpiece bearing the Antwerp mark of quality and the arms of the abbey of Averbode now in the Cluny Museum in Paris. The carved scenes are identical with those specified in the Averbode contract. The second altarpiece is lost. The style of the Cluny altarpiece shows the beginnings of Antwerp Mannerism in its elaborate and arched frame and the crowded compositions. The compact and animated figure types, unaffected gestures and angular drapery are regarded as more characteristic of late 15th-century sculpture. Other characteristics are visible in a polyptych in the collection of the National Museum in Warsaw - so-called Saint Reinhold Altar. 10 scenes from the life of Mary arranged in 2 rows with additional 4 sections with figures of Saints were crowned by architectural decorations in the form of curved tracery. The top of the retable in variety of curves and accolades, as well as disproportionality of figures are other features of de Molder's style. Oak wood, used for production, was covered with a coating of gesso (size and chalk) over which gold leaf and colour were laid. The polyptych was commissioned by Brotherhood of Saint Reinhold in Gda≈Ñsk and created before 1516 in cooperation with Joos van Cleve who painted the side wings.

They were discovered in May 2013 in a newly uncovered sediment layer of the Cromer Forest Bed on a beach at Happisburgh in Norfolk, England, and carefully photographed in 3D before being destroyed by the tide shortly afterwards. Results of research on the footprints were announced on 7 February 2014 and identified them as the oldest known hominid footprints outside Africa.Ashton N, Lewis SG, De Groote I, Duffy SM, Bates M, et al. (2014)\\"Hominin Footprints from Early Pleistocene Deposits at Happisburgh, UK\\", PLoS ONE 9(2): e88329. Before the Happisburgh discovery, the oldest known footprints in Britain were at Uskmouth in South Wales, from the Mesolithic and carbon-dated to 4,600 BCE. The oldest known hominin footprints in Europe were the Ciampate del Diavolo tracks found at the Roccamonfina volcano in Italy, dated to around 350,000 years ago. Winning the 2015 'Rescue Dig of the Year' award, the Happisburgh footprint discovery caught the public eye and was featured in an exhibition in London's Natural History Museum. Discovery Plan of the Happisburgh site, showing exposed and recorded foreshore sediments and location of the footprint surface The footprints were discovered in May 2013 by Nicholas Ashton, curator at the British Museum, and Martin Bates, from Trinity St David's University, who were carrying out research as part of the Pathways to Ancient Britain (PAB) project. The footprints were found in sediment, partially covered by beach sand, at low tide on the foreshore at Happisburgh. The sediment had been laid down in the estuary of a long-vanished river and subsequently been covered by sand, preserving its surface. The layer of sediment underlies a cliff on the beach, but after stormy weather the protective layer of sand was washed away and the sediment exposed. The sediments are stratigraphically considered to belong to the Cromer Forest Bed unit. Because of the softness of the sediment, which lay below the high tide mark, tidal action eroded it, and within two weeks the footprints had been destroyed. Although the researchers were unable to preserve the footprints, they worked during periods of low tide, often in pouring rain, to record 3D images of all the footprints by using photogrammetry. The images were analysed by Isabelle De Groote, of Liverpool John Moores University, who was able to confirm that the hollows in the sediment were hominin footprints. Facts concerning the discovery were published by Ashton and other members of the research team in February 2014 in the science journal PLOS ONE. Description Photographs of Area A at Happisburgh, showing: (a) view of footprint surface looking north; and (b) view of footprint surface looking south, also showing underlying horizontally bedded laminated silts Approximately fifty footprints were found in an area measuring nearly . Twelve were largely complete and two showed details of toes. The footprints of approximately five individuals have been identified, including adults and children. The footprints measured between , thought to equate to heights between . It is believed that the individuals who made them were from the species Homo antecessor, known to have lived in the Atapuerca Mountains of Spain around 800,000 years ago. No hominin fossils have been found at Happisburgh. Analysis shows that the group of perhaps five individuals were walking in a southerly direction (upstream) along mudflats in the estuary of an early path of the River Thames that flowed into the sea farther north than it does today when south-east Britain was joined to the European continent. Archaeologists have speculated that the group was searching the mudflats for seafood such as lugworms, shellfish, crabs, and seaweed. It is possible that the group might have lived on an island in the estuary that provided safety from predators and were travelling from their island base to the shore at low tide. Dating The Happisburgh site is too old to date using radiocarbon dating, which is not suitable for sites older than approximately 50,000 years. Dating the site has instead been based upon stratigraphy, palaeomagnetism, and the evidence of fossil flora and fauna in the sediments. Magnetic signatures within the sedimentary deposits indicate they were laid down between the two most recent geomagnetic reversals ‚Äì the Brunhes‚ÄìMatuyama reversal around 780,000 years ago and the Jaramillo reversal around 950,000 to 1 million years ago. The evidence of fossil flora and fauna using indicators such as the fossilized teeth of voles, which provide very accurate dating evidence, pushes the lower limit back to at least 840,000 years ago. On this basis, the range of possible dates for the deposition of the sediments that the footprints were found in stretches from 850,000 to 950,000 years ago, but further research is necessary to narrow the window. Pleistocene geography At the time the Happisburgh hominins lived, a land bridge existed between Britain and France before the formation of the English Channel about 450,000 years ago. The ancestral River Thames flowed further north than it does today before converging with the ancient Bytham River, while the landscape of a large part of modern-day East Anglia consisted of a series of clay ridges and troughs known as the East Anglian Crag Basin. Happisburgh lay about further inland than it does today and was the site of an ancient estuary where the Bytham and Thames rivers converged to flow into what would then have been a maritime bay. When the footprints were made, the estuary occupied a grassy, open valley surrounded by pine forests, with a climate similar to that of modern southern Scandinavia. It would have been inhabited by mammoths, rhinos, hippos, giant deer and bison, which were preyed upon by sabre-toothed cats, lions, wolves and hyenas. As well as an abundant supply of game and edible plants, the river gravels were rich in flint deposits, which early humans would have found an invaluable resource. The Happisburgh finds mark the first time that evidence of early humans from 1,000,000 years ago has been found so far north. Palaeontologists had believed that hominins of the period required a much warmer climate, but the inhabitants of prehistoric Happisburgh had adapted to the cold, suggesting that they had developed advanced methods of hunting, clothing, sheltering and warming much earlier than previously thought. Archaeological context Happisburgh has produced a number of significant archaeological finds over many years. As the shoreline is subject to severe coastal erosion, new material is constantly being exposed along the cliffs and on the beach. Prehistoric discoveries have been noted since 1820, when fishermen trawling oyster beds offshore found their nets had brought up teeth, bones, horns, and antlers from elephants, rhinos, giant deer, and other extinct species. An exceptionally high tide in February 1825 exposed more prehistoric remains when it swept away sediment that had buried an ancient landscape of fossilized tree stumps, animal bones, and fir cones. In January 1877, a great storm swept huge ironstone slabs from the sea bed onto Happisburgh beach. The slabs preserved the impressions of leaves from oaks, elms, beeches, birches, and willows that had lived thousands of years ago. Pleistocene bison bones, found in the 1870s, provided the first evidence of early human activity; a re-examination of the bones in 1999 found that they were scored with tell-tale cut marks, indicating that the animals had been butchered by humans with stone tools. Paleolithic handaxe, from Happisburgh, found on the beach by a man walking his dog in 2000 In 2000, a black flint handaxe, dating to between 600,000 and 800,000 years ago, was found by a man walking on the beach. In 2012, for the television documentary Britain's Secret Treasures, the handaxe was selected by a panel of experts from the British Museum and the Council for British Archaeology as the most important item on a list of fifty archaeological discoveries made by members of the public. Since the axe's discovery, the palaeolithic history of Happisburgh has been the subject of the Ancient Human Occupation of Britain (AHOB) and Pathways to Ancient Britain (PAB) projects, directed by Nick Ashton and Chris Stringer, funded by grants from the Leverhulme Trust and Calleva Foundation. Between 2005 and 2010, eighty palaeolithic flint tools, mostly cores, flakes, and flake tools, were excavated from the foreshore in sediment dating back to up to 950,000 years ago. The tools are believed to have been made by Homo antecessor, the same species thought to have made the footprints, and are the earliest artefacts to have been found in northern Europe. Archaeologists are hoping to reconstruct the environment in which the footprints were made by analysing remains of flora and fauna from the sediments. The remains of 15 species of mammals, 160 species of insects, and more than 100 species of plants have been recovered so far. Exhibition The Happisburgh footprints featured in an exhibition, \\"Britain: One Million Years of the Human Story\\", at the Natural History Museum in London from 13 February 2014.

Following the Bourbon Restoration in 1814, when censorship was lifted the Doctrinaires were the only group without a political organ, since the Archives philosophiques had ceased publication. A group of writers and editors was formed to address the need including Pierre Paul Royer-Collard, de Barante, Jacques Claude Beugnot, Fran√ßois Guizot, Charles de R√©musat, K√©ratry and Narcisse-Achille de Salvandy. They founded Le Courrier on 21 June 1819 from the remains of the Annales politiques, which it immediately replaced. The paper explained its mission in its first issue as being to combat the prejudices of the royalists and of the revolutionaries, to expose intrigues of both these parties, to carry the light of parties that supported the constitution, and to report the activities of politicians. The goal was not practical due to the divisions among the doctrinaires, and the original society was dissolved in the first months of 1820. The paper changed its name to Le Courrier fran√ßais with the issue of 1 February 1820. It merged with the Renomm√©e. Subsequent writers or editors included Chatelain, Benjamin Constant, √âtienne de Jouy, Jean-Pierre Pag√®s, Casimir Pierre P√©rier, Louis Marie de Lahaye de Cormenin, Dominique Dufour de Pradt, Fran√ßois-Adolphe Chambolle, L√©on Faucher, Fr√©deric Bastiat and Xavier Durrieu. The Italian journalist Ferdinando Petruccelli della Gattina was another renowned collaborator. Le Courrier fran√ßais became a leading journal, with a reputation for integrity and conviction.

Founded solely as a dance school in 2000, ADI expanded into a performance venue in 2011 and began presenting contemporary, post modern and dance theater works and providing production residencies for choreographers creating new works. In 2017, ADI had changed its name to Lumberyard Contemporary Performing Arts and had moved its location to Catskill, where it is building a performing arts center as well as producing a season in New York City. History The American Dance Institute was founded in September 2000 by Pamela Booth Bjerknes, a former dancer with American Ballet Theatre, and Michael Bjerknes, a principal dancer with The Joffrey Ballet, with financial support from Solange MacArthur. In 2010, newly hired Executive Director Adrienne Willis created the company's Performance Series and Incubator program.https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/american- dance-institute-dances-to-edge-of- suburbs/2013/02/21/c378b122-7af0-11e2-82e8-61a46c2cde3d_story.html In under a year, ADI began presenting contemporary, post-modern and dance theatre works starting with Doug Elkins‚Äô 'Fraulein Maria' in May 2011.https://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/performing-arts/fraulein- maria,1208337.html#critic-review Later that year, ADI presented its first full season, featuring Jane Comfort & Company, David Dorfman Dance, Sara Rudner and Dana Reitz, among others. Dedicated to meeting the needs of dance artists, in 2012 ADI hired renowned puppeteer and performance artist Dan Hurlin to serve as its artistic advisor. In this capacity, Hurlin helped design ADI's Incubator and in 2013 ADI put together an Artistic Advisory Board made up of some of today's most progressive choreographers. Advisory Board members include, Dan Hurlin serving as the board chair, Brian Brooks, Jane Comfort, David Dorfman, Doug Elkins, Jodi Melnick, David Neumann., and Jawole Willa Jo Zollar from Urban Bush Women. While in Maryland, the company's facility was a former warehouse behind Congressional Plaza in Rockville, MD, It housed the Solange Macarthur Theater, a 150-seat black-box theatre named after ADI's most ardent supporter; four large studios with sprung floors, sounds systems and pianos; and administrative offices. Lumberyard In 2018, Lumberyard will open a new facility in Catskill, New York specially to support late-stage development of new work. Lumberyard will house the Incubator ‚Äì a production residency program that helps new contemporary dance and performance work become premiere-ready by providing extended tech time for artists and their collaborators and presenting public premieres and work-in-progress showings. Since its creation in 2011, the Incubator has helped strengthen premieres of 19 new works and has seen increasing demand from artists seeking vital late- stage support and audiences hungry for new work. Renovations to a former lumberyard on the Catskill Creek will create a black box theater, artist housing, and community courtyard specially designed to serve the development of new work and build new audiences for contemporary dance. ADI/NYC The New York City season is an evolution of ADI's production residency program, which provides significant support to artists as they integrate design elements into new work. Each of the five works in the 2016 ADI/NYC season has received up to two weeks of production support, including: unrestricted use of a theater and ADI's production crew; meals; housing and transportation, as needed; photo and video documentation; and a presenting fee. The program's goal is to provide artists with the resources they need to fully realize the vision for their new work.  Performance Series  ‚ÄúMost of what Lumberyard presents in its performance series is work you might not otherwise see unless you trek to the niches of Lower Manhattan,‚Äù The Washington Post. This statement encapsulates the intention behind ADI's Performance Series. ADI purposely seeks out high-quality experimental dance by artists who may not be as well known to DC-area audiences as more conventional groups. Executive Director Adrienne Willis intentionally chose this type of programming because she firmly believed DC's intellectual audiences would respond positively to edgy, progressive dance. ADI's Performance Series runs from October through May each year, bringing to the DC area a diverse set of artists from across the U.S. and beyond. Current and past Performance Series companies by season include:  Incubator  ADI's Incubator program, begun the same year as its Performance Series, is a late-stage residency program providing artists from outside the Washington, DC region with unrestricted use of ADI‚Äôs theater; unlimited support from ADI‚Äôs full-time production staff; housing; meals; local transportation; and a fee to help companies cover other expenses, such as dancer salaries . The program grew from a need within the dance community for late-stage dance residencies ‚Äì residencies that enable artists to refine new works just before their premieres. Not only does the National Incubator provide area residents with a sneak peek at new works before anyone in the country, but ADI's National Incubator blog also provides insights from the artists about their artistic processes and more.  Future Artists Scholarship  Beginning in 2016, ADI will offer scholarships that support the development of the next generation of artists and address issues of diversity and equitable access to dance training. ADI Future Artists Project is scholarship initiative investing in talented young dancers from diverse backgrounds to increase racial diversity in the dance field. ADI will build a flexible scholarship program that offers targeted scholarships to deal with a broad set of needs, including tuition, transportation stipends, and dance clothing. The project will target racially diverse students from all over the country that want to pursue professional training in dance.  Audience Education/Opportunities  Prior to every Performance Series, National Incubator, ADI holds pre-show talks to provide insight into what audiences will see onstage ‚Äì a unique component that has proven very successful. ADI also offers post-show receptions where patrons can interact with dance artists and each other. Catering to dance students age 16 and up, visiting artists often lead one-hour master dance classes to give DC-area dancers opportunities to learn from some of the most innovative choreographers working today.

The America First Association of Minnesota (AFA) was a patriotic organization established in the state of Minnesota in November 1917 with a view to assisting the efforts of the United States of America in World War I. The organization was based in the city of St. Paul and was constituted on a county-by-county basis throughout the state. The AFA was one of the leading non-partisan political organizations in that state during wartime. History=Background During the summer of 1917 the upper midwestern state of Minnesota was one of the focal points of the American anti-war movement. The city of Minneapolis was governed by a Socialist mayor, Thomas Van Lear, and the heavily ethnic state was home to a vigorous labor movement and a varied radical press. The People's Council of America for Democracy and the Terms of Peace, an anti-militarist organization established in New York City in May 1917 as a center for socialist and pacifist anti-war activity, sought to hold its first national conference in Minneapolis on September 1 of that year. The efforts of this group to organize against the American war effort came as a direct challenge to President Woodrow Wilson and supporters of the national military cause, and a boycott was launched to deny the People's Council use of a meeting hall in Minneapolis. The alternative idea of meeting in a circus tent was advanced,\\"The People's Council of America for Democracy and Peace,\\" The Advocate of Peace [Washington, DC], vol. 59, no. 9 (October 1917), pp. 279-280. only to be rejected by conservative Governor Joseph Burquist, who just one week before the scheduled start of the People's Council conclave unilaterally banned the group from gathering anywhere in the state.H.C. Peterson and Gilbert C. Fite, Opponents of War, 1917-1918. Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press, 1957; pp. 76-77. The organization was thus effectively chased from Minnesota to the city of Chicago, where its national convention was ultimately disbursed by the police.Peterson and Fife, Opponents of War, pg. 77. Despite the victory over the perceived radical and pacifist interlopers, patriotic sentiment throughout Minnesota was aroused, providing a fertile ground for pro-military organization.

It is often referred to as wrought leather.Wrought Leather; as a medium of decoration by Helen Henderso] House & Garden, Volume 4 page 227 It is often gilded, painted and decorated. With the advent of wallpaper use from about 1650-1750, leather was used to cover and decorate sections of walls in the habitations of wealthy persons. Leather is pliable and could be decorated in various ways. Cuir de Cordoue, or cordwain or cordovan (meaning: \\"from C√≥rdoba\\"), sometimes called gold leather (from Dutch \\"goudleer\\"), refers to painted and gilded (and often embossed) leather hangings, manufactured in panels and assembled for covering walls as an alternative to tapestry. These terms are mostly used for historical and antique materials. History Cuir de Cordoue originated from North Africa and was introduced to Spain as early as the ninth century. In Spain such embossed leather hangings were known as guadamec√≠, from the Libyan town of Ghadames, while cordobanes (\\"cordovan\\") signified soft goat leather.John Waterer, Spanish Leather (Faber & Faber, London, 1971), outlines the history of this technique In 1316, a Cuir de Cordoue guild existed in Barcelona. Spanish gold leather was popular until the early seventeenth century. In the fifteenth or sixteenth century, the technique reached the Low Countries, first in Flanders and Brabant, where it was further developed. Though there were craftsmen in several cities (such as Antwerp, Brussels, and Ghent), the major handicraft center for gold leather was Mechelen, where it was mentioned as early as 1504. In the Dutch Republic gold leather-making flourished in the seventeenth century in Amsterdam, The Hague and Middelburg. In Amsterdam, at least eleven gold leather-makers were active. One of them, Hans le Maire, because of the smell, the need for water, wind and light, working at the edge of the city or in Vreeland,Het Goudleerhuis te Vreeland used up to 16,000 hides of calves and some 170,000 leaves of silver annually.http://research.frick.org/montias/browserecord2.php?-action=browse&-recid=1746 [deadlink] Dutch Cuir de Cordoue was exported to Germany, Denmark, Sweden, China and Japan. The last Amsterdam gold leather merchant Willem van den Heuvel closed around 1680, but the trade and production continued in Flanders and Northern France. Embossed wall coverings made to imitate antique embossed leather include Tynecastle, or Modeled Canvas. It was developed and patented in 1874 by designer W. Scott Morton (1840-1903). It was made by hand pressing canvas into carved wooden molds and dry it. It was colored after it was stuck to the wall. Japanese Leather Paper imitates embossed leather. It is crafted from sheets of handmade paper pressed together. It is then embossed and gilded with the field color stenciled on it. A coat of lacquer was added to protect it and create a sheen. During the colonial period in the United States, embossed leather panels were occasionally used as an accent, as a dado, on a screen, or above a chimney. In the last quarter of the 19th century, leather panels were revived and used in select rooms of mansions such as libraries. Introduced in the 1860s as \\"oil leather papers\\", the coverings later became known as \\"leather paper\\" and were offered in catalogs from Paul Balin in Paris' Birge in Buffalo, New York; and Jeffrey & Co. and Woollams & Co.. They included embossing, gild and painted finishes designed to imitate leather wallpaper and were used to line furniture and cabinets. Their use continued in fancy homes of the late 19th and early 20th century decorating Lincrusta and Anaglypta were competing products . Leather papers were often made up of a series of paper laminates which were forced into shape with a mold, while Lincrusta is a patented composite material, and Anaglypta is a simthat were not designed to look like leather wallpaper. Rottman, Strome & Co. became a major producer based in England with manufacturing in Japan. Lutson Goudleder made the imitation leather coverings in southern France and they were also made in Poland.Leather Wallpaper Scholar Technique Cuir de Cordoba was usually made of fine leather; often calf skins were used. The technique consisted of shaping panels of wet leather over wooden moulds, then painting them, then oil-gilding and lacquering them. Sometimes smooth panels of painted Cuir de Cordoue were used. Patterns for these panels followed fashions in silk damask, at some lag in time, since the high-relief wooden moulds were laborious to make. After the second half of the 18th century, this luxurious artisan product was no longer made, its place taken in part by chintz hangings and printed wallpapers. In the eighteenth century Chinoiserie patterns were popular with Cuir de Cordoue.

In Belgium fine examples can be seen in Museum Plantin-Moretus in Antwerp, Museum Hof van Busleyden in Mechelen and Malonne Abbey (near Namur). In Germany examples of Ledertapete can be found in the Town Hall of Bremen and Moritzburg Castle (near Dresden).

Background The South Devon Railway Company commissioned Isambard Kingdom Brunel to develop its route between to . Having physically surveyed all route options, based on the reason of the substantial cost savings against tunnelling through the steep South Devon hills, Brunel proposed a route that followed the coastline created through a combination of dynamite and quarrying, and where necessary through the construction of a suitable seawall. The broad gauge railway of gauge opened on 30 May 1846, designed to be worked as an atmospheric railway. Atmospheric trains only ran from 13 September 1847 until 9 September 1848, and the line was extended to on 31 December 1846. The South Devon Railway was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway (GWR) on 1 February 1876, and the gauge converted to the 4‚Äô 8.5‚Äù (1435mm) standard gauge after 20 May 1892. A station was opened to serve in 1905, all the other stations on the sea wall having opened with the line in 1846. Proposal Due to the substantial high costs of maintenance of the South Devon Railway sea wall \\\\- making it the most expensive piece of the GWR's infrastructure to maintain per mile \\\\- the Dawlish Avoiding Line was first proposed in 1933, to keep the Exeter to Plymouth Line working. Whilst the GWR were still investigating the scheme, in light of the continuing effects of the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression, in 1935 as part of his economic redevelopment plan Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain proposed establishing an independent special purpose vehicle finance company for railway development, backed by a government loan guarantee limited to ¬£26.5 million. This could then be drawn down by any of the big four railway companies, with the GWR allocated \\"eleven fifty-third parts\\" to support the projects it had submitted for inclusion in the agreement, all of which had to be completed by 1 January 1941. Under the 1935 Finance Act, the GWR initially submitted just one proposal in the Treasury agreement (First Schedule, Part 1, Clause 2) which read: \\"Construction of a new deviation line from Dawlish Warren to Newton Abbot\\". The proposed 1933 scheme within the two draft 1936 bills, diverted from the existing line south of . The scheme then went south through Kenton to Dawlish about inland, then heading southwest under Holcombe Down avoiding Teignmouth, before rejoining the existing line to the east of Bishopsteignton. It was costed at ¬£3m, and included three short tunnels and one long tunnel of . Parliament passed the Great Western Railway (Additional Powers) Act 1936, in which the Dawlish Avoiding Line is cited as \\"Railway No 1\\" amongst several projects listed. But, to enable more schemes to be developed, the GWR later proposed a shorter route. Running for , it deviated from the railway bridge over the Hackney Canal near Newton Abbot, and re-joined the main line at a point north of towards Cockwood, alongside the River Exe. However, in 1937 the GWR returned to a scheme closer to the original, called \\"Railway No 2‚Äù. Adding a further , it commenced at the same point south of Dawlish on the initial deviation route (authorised earlier by the 1936 Act), terminating close to at a junction south of a bridge carrying Milbury Lane over the line. Construction The GWR started construction in Spring 1939, with surveyors poles in place along the proposed route by the summer. But after the outbreak of World War II, all work stopped. Work was never restarted, and the GWR was nationalised into British Railways on 1 January 1948. BR subsequently sold the purchased land in the 1950s, and the construction powers of the associated Act of Parliament lapsed in 1999. Present The South Devon Railway sea wall‚Äîestimated to be the most expensive railway infrastructure to maintain per mile in the United Kingdom‚Äîis now owned by Network Rail, and the stations and majority of trains are operated by Great Western Railway. Since the termination of the LSWR Exeter to Plymouth line during the Beeching Axe, and the blocking of the SDR sea wall route in 2012, 2013, and demolition during the storms of Winter 2013‚Äì2014, a number of parties have called for reconsideration of construction of the Dawlish Avoiding Line.

The large Ganerbenburg (jointly inherited castle) is still partly occupied today and not all areas are accessible to the public.  Location  The castle was built about a kilometre east of Bad Neustadt on the western end of the plateau above Neuhaus and is separated from the land in front of it by a roughly 160-metre- long neck ditch. Until the 19th century the whole hillside was cleared and was used as early as the High Middle Ages for viticulture. The present, thickly wooded ridge on which the castle stands is also the site of the extensive Franconian Clinic (Rh√∂n-Klinikum AG), which dominates the landscape.  History = Early Middle Ages  By the Carolingian era, the Salzgau around Neustadt was already very important. An imperial palace (Pfalz) was even built here; it was given to the Bishopric of Wurzburg in 1000 A.D. by Emperor Otto III. This palace was probably on the site of the present village of Salz or in its immediate vicinity. A castle was built on the nearby Veitsberg hill, probably in Ottonian times during the period of the Hungarian invasions, to protect the local populace. A fortified enclosure of unknown date may have been located on the site of the present castle of Salzburg. These fortifications, too, may have been upgraded in the first half of the 10th century into a refuge castle in the face of attacks by the Magyars. The first record of the Salzburg occurs in a copy of a deed by Emperor Louis the Pious dated around 1160. The original document is missing and could have been inadvertently and mistakenly amended by its scribe, Friar Eberhard of Fulda Abbey, to show the place of publication (Actum-Zeile or Ausstellungsort) as the Salzburg or Salzberg: \\"Act(um) in Salzb. Curia regia\\".Hessian State Archives, Marburg (Hessisches Staatsarchiv Marburg), K425. Codex Eberhardi, fol. 82r and v. The copy of this early medieval document clearly suggests that the royal palace of Salz was actually located on the castle hill and older research invariably locates this royal court on the site of the more recent castle. Later on, the Veitsberg near Salz was generally reckoned to be the location of the palace while, today, historians favour the village of Salz or its immediate surroundings as the likely site. Friar Eberhard may have only knew of the new site of the castle and replaced the village name of Salz by the abbreviation \\"Salzb.\\" (Salzburg) throughout his transcript.  High and Late Middle Ages  The bergfried of the \\"Voitscher Ansitz\\" in the south of the site The walled stone castle replaced an older palisaded ditch hewn from the limestone rock. This discovery was only made in 1984 during an official excavation of the foundations. This originally wooden, protective rampart is about a metre behind the stone wall and was probably a provisional enhancement to protect the site. The oldest curtain wall was obviously not fully developed. The elements of the fortified site datable to the first phase of construction are up to four metres high, but there are long stretches where only the foundation seems to have been laid. Whether the Bishop of W√ºrzburg intended to form a major administrative centre or even a fortified village, here, remains speculative.

She belonged to the elite of her trade and became a known figure of her time, mentioned in memoirs, diaries and literature. Life The activity of Lovisa von Plat is first documented in a well known court case of 1747, which centered around Helena Bohman, one of the prostitutes of the stable of Lovisa von Plat.Hallman, Mila, M√•lare och urmakare, flickor och l√∂sdrifvare: historier fr√•n gamla Stockholm, Fr√∂l√©en, Stockholm, 1907 The background and identity of Lovisa von Plat is sketchy, and the information she gave in 1747 may not have been truthful. In the census of 1747, Lovisa von Plat claimed to have been \\"thirty and more\\", and that she was the daughter of an officer by the name von Plat. According to the city census, she was officially registered as poor. In reality, however, this could not have been the case, as she was in parallel listed as employing a maid, wearing a wig and powder and using snus. When she was first questioned in the court case of 1747, she stated that her name was Helena Fahlberg. Later in court, however, she claimed that she had given the name of Fahlberg only because that was the name of her mothers first husband, while she was the daughter of her mothers second marriage with the officer von Plat, hence von Plat was in fact her proper name. Court case of 1747 In 1747, Lovisa von Plat was pointed out as a procurer by the seventeen year old Helena Bohman, the daughter of a wealthy craftsman who had run away from home and had been reported for prostitution. This court case was to attract great attention, last for months and involve numerous people. Helena Bohman claimed that Lovisa von Plat had rented out her sexual services to various men from the upper classes and nobility, whom she met at the home of von Plat, or at various places to which she had been escorted by von Plat. Lovisa von Plat was portrayed as a well known elite procurer who provided prostitutes for upper class clients in Stockholm. When summoned, Lovisa von Plat claimed to be a seamstress; she stated that she had tried to provide Bohman with work as a seamstress or a domestic, and that the men frequenting her home was merely her clients in her capacity of a seamstress. Several other witnesses gave damaging testimonies against von Plat. When she was summoned before the court a next time, however, Lovisa von Plat refused to attend court and left the city. It was noted that she had taken refuge in an unidentified vicarage in the countryside. A Governor testified to her good character, and Baron von Kurck claimed that she and the prostitutes of her stable where all seamstresses and laundresses in his employ. During this epoch, unmarried women who could not prove that she had a legal profession, a fortune or a protector who could vouch for her, risked being placed at the L√•ngholmens spinnhus, and elite prostitutes with contacts where normally protected against this by a wealthy clients who provided them with such an assurance. On 2 October, the case was dismissed on a legal teqnicality; because neither Bohman nor von Plat was residing in the city district in which the court case was conducted, and thus were out of its jurisdiction. The case was thus discontinued without it having led to any verdict, and there are no documentation than either Bohman or von Plat where ever punished by a legal court for these offences. von Plat went free despite evidence being presented that she owned a brothel, and it is seen as likely that she was protected by influential clients. Later life Lovisa von Plat was evidently protected against prosecution by her connections among the upper class clientele to whom she catered. In 1757, she married Carl Otto Kretzmer, a grenadier sergeant of the royal Livgardet. From the 1760s, she owned and operated the brothel Platskans jungfrubur ('The Plat Woman's Maiden Cage'), which was situated at the \\"S:t Olof R√∂da tomt\\" near the Adolf Fredrik Church, and which was the perhaps most famous Stockholm brothel during the reign of Gustav III of Sweden, alongside her main rival, the Ahlstr√∂ms jungfrubur ('The Ahlstr√∂m Maiden cage') of the former sea captain Magnus Ahlstr√∂m. In official documents, her brothel business is not very visible. In the census of 1760, the house in which her brothel was situated is stated to be owned by the married military wife \\"Lowisa Kritzmer\\"; in 1770, the owner was named as the widow \\"Helena Lovisa Kritzmer\\", age 49; and in 1780 by \\"Lena Lisa Krusmer\\", age 52, which was clearly the same person as Lovisa von Plat, with different spellings of her name, who obviously gave wrong information of her age. It appears that she officially categorized her brothel as a tavern. As was the case in 1747, Lovisa von Plat does not appear to have had many prostitutes actually living in the brothel, but rather to have the names of prostitutes whom she arranged to met clients in her house or in other places. In 1770, the people listed to live with her was her two daughters, \\"a pauper of ill health\\", the daughter of a pottery maker named Maja Lena Dahlberg, a soldier and two widows; and in 1780, the household consisted of herself and her two daughters as well as two other women. The death date of Lovisa von Plat has not been found in any public documents. Bellman stated in his death poem over her that she died in October 1785. It is noted, however, that her name is still placed as number one in Petter Wessman's famous list over all procurers of Stockholm from 1786. Legacy Lovisa von Plat is referred to in many diaries, memoirs, letters and chronicles of the time, and was the subject of many so-called \\"Whore Poems\\" from 18th-century Stockholm.Lennartsson, Rebecka, Fr√•n skuggsidan: folk och f√∂rbrytelser ur Stockholms historia, Stockholmia, Stockholm, 2014 Her brothel is portrayed in the famed erotic memoirs of Gustaf Hallenstierna, who named himself, Nils von Rosenstein and Carl Fredrik Fredenheim as her clients.Mina k√§rleks√§ventyr: En dagbok fr√•n sjuttonhundratalet.

After her death, Bellman wrote a poem over her death, \\"Platskans √∂verfart p√• Styx i Oktober 1785\\" ('The passing of The River Styx by the Plat Woman in October 1785').Samlade skrifter: Av Johan Henrik Kellgren.

Education and career Litherland earned a BSc in 1949 and a PhD in 1955 from the University of Liverpool. From 1953 to 1955 he was a National Research Council Fellow and from 1955 to 1966 a career scientist at Chalk River Laboratories with Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. In 1966 he became a professor of physics at the University of Toronto and in 1979 a full professor, retiring as professor emeritus in 1993. In the academic years 1960‚Äì61 and 1972‚Äì73 he was a visiting professor at the University of Oxford.Albert Edward Litherland ‚Äì The Canadian Encyclopedia Litherland and Allan Bromley were, in the words of J. C. D. \\"Doug\\" Milton, \\"two of the key people working on the van de Graaff accelerators, the 3 MV home-made single- ended machine, and beginning in 1958, the world's first tandem accelerator, the EN tandem. The unprecedented precision and flexibility of the EN tandem made Chalk River the envy of physicists around the world and opened up the field of heavy-ion physics. Allan Bromley is sometimes called the father of heavy-ion physics. Litherland was honoured first of all for his work on the 3 MV machine through which, and with his insight and courage, the first proof that the collective model could be applied to a light nucleus, in this case 25Al. It led to a great simplification of our understanding of the spectra of such nuclei and directly to the Unified Model. Litherland went on to make critical contributions to nuclear structure research, primarily through the introduction, with John Ferguson, of new gamma-ray angular correlation techniques. In 1966, Litherland was recruited by the University of Toronto, and in 1967, he, along with Harry Gove and Ken Purser, realized the unique value of a tandem accelerator in measuring exquisitely minute quantities of 14C. Thus was born accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS); for his contribution the University of Toronto made him a university professor. Litherland subsequently became the director of Isotrace, a facility that leads the world in the introduction of new AMS techniques.\\" IsoTrace Laboratory In 1982 Litherland was the director for the establishment of the IsoTrace Laboratory at the University of Toronto. The initiation of the creation of the ISOTRACE (ISOTope and Rare Atom Counting Equipment) Laboratory occurred in April 1979 with Litherland and Rolf P. Beukens as two of the most important scientists involved. While in operation from 1982 to its interim replacement period from 2008 to 2013, the laboratory used nuclear techniques in supersensitive mass spectrometers for archaeological dating, trace element detection, etc. In 2013 the IsoTrace Laboratory ceased operation and was fully replaced by the Andr√© E.

It is native to estuarine waters in Texas and Florida in the United States. It is often referred to in the literature as Mysidopsis bahia and is widely cultured and used in the laboratory for toxicology testing. Description Americamysis bahia grows to a length of about , the females being larger than the males. These shrimps are transparent, often with a yellowish, brownish or blackish tinge. Distribution and habitat Americamysis bahia is native to the east coast of the United States, its range extending from Rhode Island to Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. It is an estuarine species and can tolerate a wide range of salinity levels ranging from 54 to 2 psu (practical salinity units), being most common around 30 psu. It is seldom found at depths greater than and its typical habitat is over sandy or muddy seabeds, often in seagrass meadows. Behaviour Americamysis bahia is found on or just above the seabed, tending to be concentrated in slight depressions and facing towards the current. At night it makes vertical migrations to feed at the surface. Opossum shrimps are omnivores and although the diet of Americamysis bahia in the wild has not been studied, examination of the stomach contents of the closely related Americamysis almyra showed 31% vascular plant debris and 11% copepods and diatoms. In the laboratory it is usually fed on the larvae of the brine shrimp Artemia salina. Opossum shrimps play an important part in the food chain and are consumed in large quantities by such fish as the inland silverside, whiffs and flounders. Life cycle Female Americamysis bahia shrimps become mature between the twelfth and twentieth day, depending on diet and temperature. The eggs are fertilised and the embryos develop in the female‚Äôs brood pouch, underneath her thorax. Batches of five to seven young per brood are usual and are released into the water column in four to six days. The juveniles are planktonic for twenty-four hours before settling on the bottom. Females can produce multiple broods over the course of a few months. Use in research Americamysis bahia is relatively sensitive to toxic pollutants. Because of this and the fact that it is small, has a short life cycle, and is easy to culture, it is extensively used in toxicity testing.

Nevis flag flying in upper right of image. Southeastern Peninsula of the Island of St. Kitts visible in the distance. Captain Roy Arthur Anslyn , formally known as Arthur Anslyn or Captain Anslyn, and informally known as \\"Brother\\" Anslyn, was born 23 December 1944 on the island of Nevis in the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis, Leeward Islands, Lesser Antilles, West Indies. He died on 7 October 2017. Anslyn was a recognized expert in marine knowledge who, from 1999 to his death, served as Marine Consultant to the Premier's Ministry, Nevis Air and Sea Ports Authority, Nevis Island Administration (NIA), and Marine Advisor to the Premier's Ministry, NIA. Over the years, Anslyn received numerous awards, both for his service to the community and for his bravery in saving lives and property in extreme situations. Anslyn was honoured with the insignia of a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1985. He was very active over the years in search and rescue, marine ambulance service, and other marine emergency services on Nevis. Using scuba, he took part in the underwater survey for the official inquiry after the 1970 Christena disaster, a ferry boat shipwreck which involved a great loss of life. Anslyn was captain of the Carib Queen ferryboat for 19 years, and was subsequently the Director of Fisheries at the NIA for many years. Anslyn was also an active member of Nevis Historical and Conservation Society. Brother Anslyn lived in Charlestown, the capital of Nevis. His family name was originally Anslijn, of Dutch extraction: he had family ties to Saba, a Dutch island which lies north of Sint Eustatius. In 1995, a reporter for the St. Kitts and Nevis Observer commented, \\"...he's one of those rare individuals who not only performs a public service...but also touch[es] the lives of so many of us\\" and, \\"We are fortunate to have someone like Brother among us\\".The St. Kitts - Nevis Observer, 23‚Äì29 April 1995, section \\"Spotlight\\", page 16, \\"Brother Anslyn: His Love for the Sea and his Countrymen Shine Through\\" Overview In 2014, Captain Arthur Anslyn standing at the port in Nevis with the stern of MV Carib Queen visible behind him; he was Captain of that ferryboat for 19 years. Anslyn was an expert on marine matters. He was a highly experienced fisher and scuba diver. In 2000, Anslyn became Director of Fisheries at the NIA, a position which he held for many years. Anslyn also helped create and organize a Fishermen's Cooperative on Nevis. For 19 years, from 1980 to 1999, Anslyn was Master of the Carib Queen, one of several St. Kitts and Nevis ferry boats. During this time period, Anslyn was given an award by the St. Kitts-Nevis Chamber of Industry and Commerce for his actions in saving the Carib Queen from being wrecked during the passage of Hurricane Klaus in 1984. The hurricane struck without prior warning while the Carib Queen was at dock in St. Kitts, getting an engine overhauled. As the storm intensified, Anslyn took the boat offshore, anchored it, and went and got one other crew member. They then both swam out to the boat, climbed aboard and rode the hurricane out at sea, with only one engine intact.MV Caribe Queen stopping at the island of Montserrat in 2011 In 1989, Anslyn once again saved the Carib Queen from destruction during the passage of Hurricane Hugo, by taking the ship to a slightly more sheltered area in Sint Maarten. Although he had successfully saved the Carib Queen, he subsequently found out that his own boat back on Nevis had been destroyed by the hurricane, which caused great damage to Nevis. Anslyn piloted and worked on numerous sail boats and motor craft, both freight and passenger vessels, and studied marine topics at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and other marine science centers. History=Family background and influences The paternal grandfather of Arthur Anslyn was Dr. Nicolas Anslijn, who was born in 1823 on the southern Caribbean Dutch colonial island of Cura√ßao, part of the Leeward Antilles. Nicolas Anslijn came north to the small Dutch colonial island of Saba as a government physician. He was a \\"pensioned officer of health of the first class\\" and was also made a Knight of the Order of the Netherlands Lion. His father had been a Dutch schoolteacher, also named Nicolas Anslijn, and his mother had been the daughter of a Venezuelan general who had fought alongside Simon Bolivar. At 54, after his first wife died, Dr. Nicolas Anslijn married 19-year-old Esther Zipporah Benjamin Hassell on Saba; they had two sons, Edward John Arthur Anslyn and William Carl Anslyn. In 1863, when slavery was abolished in the Dutch colonies, Nicolas Anslijn was the official who read the Dutch colonial emancipation proclamation in the settlement of Windwardside on Saba. He died during a visit to Sint Maarten, and was buried there at Little Bay.Saba Herald, 24 June 1993, number 299, page 7, Saba Nicolas Anslijn's son, Edward Anslyn, moved to St. Eustatius, and from there to Nevis.

Roy Arthur Anslyn, Edward's first son, was always informally known as \\"Brother\\" and more formally as Arthur (his second name) rather than Roy. Arthur followed in his father's footsteps by working on the sea and becoming a sea captain, although, as he commented in 1995, \\"My father always told me not to go to sea -- it's a hard life\\".

Arthur Anslyn was off- island in Minnesota, USA, on 1 August 1970, at the beginning of the Emancipation Day holiday weekend, when the ferry boat MV Christina was traveling from Basseterre, St. Kitts to Charlestown, Nevis, on the last run of the day. The boat was greatly overloaded with passengers, with more than twice the recommended number of people on board, and halfway to her destination, she sank. Of the approximately 320 people who were on the Christina, only about 90 survived, nearly all of whom had to be rescued.1985, Whitman T.

As soon as Anslyn was back on-island, he was put in charge of scuba diving the wreck site using shark cages, in order to carry out the official survey of the disaster. In total after the boat sank, 57 bodies were retrieved that could be identified, and 66 bodies were retrieved that were unidentifiable. Some bodies were trapped in the sunken wreckage; as was recounted in 1997: \\" 'A decision was made to leave the boat and [the entrapped] bodies undisturbed' note[d] Arthur Anslyn, Captain of the Caribe Queen, who was hired by the Commission of Inquiry to dive the site after August 1\\".Page 310.

A distress call came in from a woman: \\"Man overboard 20 miles SW of Nevis\\". In retrospect it became clear that, \\"[t]he names of the two people were Edwin Wolfe and Ruth Sarris, both Americans on the way from Antigua to Nevis, when the dinghy being towed broke away. In an effort to retrieve it Mr. Wolfe fell overboard and, fortunately, Miss Sarris threw him a lifeline\\". The weather was already bad and rapidly worsening, with large swells and strong wind. Anslyn went out in the Carib Queen to attempt a rescue. The weather was so bad by that point that another boat responding to the distress call was forced to give up and turn back. Anslyn managed to make radio contact, and the woman told him: \\"Hurry, hurry, please hurry, I am losing him.\\" Anslyn managed to locate the vessel and had no choice but to jump overboard and swim out to the man, who was very weak at that point and physically unable to climb. Anslyn unlocked and unfolded the boarding ladder of the yacht, and managed to lift and hoist the man onto the deck.

Location  The ruins of the old castle lie east of Vollmerz and northeast of Ramholz on the domed crest of a hill spur, the eponymous Steckelberg.  History  The name of the castle goes back to the Middle High German term for \\"steep hill\\" (Stechelnberc). As an imperial castle the fortification was used to guard the transportation routes that ran through the hills. The wine route from Fulda to Franconia ran over the ridge of the Breite First here; this important north-south link, which research on old roads indicates was known as early as the Carolingian period, grazes the area of the castle as it passes from Veitsteinbach and Sterbfritz.Landau, Georg: Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der alten Heer- und Handelstra√üen, B√§renreiter Verlag, Kassel and Basle, Nachdruck, 1958, p. 85 From 1131 to 1391 had their family seat at an earlier castle on a nearby site. This \\"Old Steckelberg Castle\\" (alte Burg Steckelberg) was located to the northeast of the present ruins on a spur of the Breite First which is known today as Alteburgberg or Nickus. The baronial line of Hermann von Steckelberg is mentioned around 1167. Roughly between 1240 and 1276 the castle must have been in the possession of the Bishopric of Wurzburg. In 1274 Bishop Berthold II pledged the castle to Count Reinhard I of Hanau, whom he needed as an ally. In 1276 it was illegally occupied and used as a robber baron castle. It was destroyed by order of King Rudolph I in 1276. He issued a decree on 14 October 1276 which ordered that \\"the Steckelburg is to be demolished and is not to be rebuilt without imperial leave.\\".Arnd, Carl: Geschichte der Provinz Hanau und der unteren Maingegend, Verlag Friedrich K√∂nig, Hanau, 1858, p. 333 The castle was supposedly a threat to the peace or Landfrieden; more probably it served to tidy up the estates of the Landvogt and confidant of the king, the Count of Hanau, in this area. Nevertheless, the lords of Steckelberg retained rights of management and use. There are no more details of the history of the Old Steckelberg Castle. It is, however, certain that this was not the oldest fortification in this location. In 1969 the remains of a large circular rampart, about 0.38 hectares in area and dating to the Early Middle Ages, were discovered in the immediate vicinity. The male line of the Steckelberg family was extinguished in the mid-14th century and both estates and hereditary fiefs went to the daughters and their husbands, among them, Frowin von Hutten (died 1377). He inherited inter alia arable fields and pasture land at Steckelberg. Frowin's son, Ulrich von Hutten, (died 1423) used this starting point to re-fortify the castle hill in 1388 and build Steckelberg Castle in its present location. In order to legally circumvent the royal prohibition, the castle was moved a few hundred metres to a site above the earlier castle destroyed in 1276. This de facto breach of the law went unpunished, because Ulrich transferred ownership of the castle back to the Bishop of W√ºrzburg and thus removed the power of jurisdiction from the actual rulers, i.e. the Count of Hanau. After Ulrich's death the whole family was enfeoffed with Steckelberg Castle. In 1452 Lorenz von Hutten (died 1498) signed a Burgfrieden agreement with the other co-heirs that, in addition to laying down the charges for common facilities, specified how the castle would be supplied in the event of a siege and under which conditions the castle could be used as the base in the event of feuds. In spite of this settlement, a dispute broke out that same year between Hutten-Steckelberg and their Wurzburg liege lord when he wanted to take on 32 external heirs. As a result, in 1458 the castle was besieged and finally conquered by Bishop John. By 1459 he had returned the castle, however, after an agreement had been reached. The partially demolished buildings were rebuilt or renovated and occupied once more. On 21 April 1488, the reforming knight, Ulrich von Hutten, was born here. In a letter to Willibald Pirckheimer dated 1518, he vividly describes - but probably in an overstated way - the conditions at his home castle.Marburg Digital Archive: 1275 extract from the letter of Ulrich von Hutten (1488-1523) to Nuremberg patrician, Willibald Pirckheimer (1470-1530) about life in a castle, 25 October 1518 In 1525, rebel farmers stormed the Steckelberg, but failed to take it. From the mid-16th century, the secondary family seat at the foot of Castle Hill in the parish of Ramholz gained in importance to its owners. Steckelberg Castle maintained its defensive role until the late 17th century, as enfeoffments during the Thirty Years' War make clear. Philipp Daniel von Hutten (died 1687) was the last aristocratic inhabitant of the castle, however. From this period there is also a hand drawing showing the castle in its final phase, having probably remained largely unaltered since 1509. In 1700, the castle was already being used as a quarry. It can be assumed that, in the course of the Thirty Years' War it became uninhabitable. In 1883 Baron Hugo von Stumm purchased the ruins and protected them from further decay. He bought the Hutten estate in Ramholz for himself and built it into a spacious palace complex in the style of historicism. In 2004 the current owner had the east wall of the castle renovated and cleared the moat. In early 2008 the ruins were placed out of bounds because parts of the north wall had collapsed. On 26 May 2013 the newly renovated ruins of Steckelberg Castle were officially re-opened to the public.  Layout  Ground plan of the castle The ruins of the old castle today comprise the remains of a rectangular curtain wall with, in the west, a turret at the entrance (with a modern chimney built in), a three-storey cabinet in the northwest and a cellar. In mid-2007, large parts of the walls collapsed. According to a theory that has been repeated uncritically, Ulrich's father of the same name had the so-called Batterieturm built in 1509 as a mighty powder or battery tower that was to control access to the castle. However, its masonry and embrasures clearly show that the tower was built as part of the 1388/1389 construction. The door with the year 1509 on it was added later. That year marked the conversion of the tower, which had become rather unusable, into additional domestic accommodation, as evinced by the architectural design of the door, chimney and other details.Joachim Dittrich Burg Steckelberg: Die Fehldatierung des \\"Batterieturms\\" , 2006/2009.

It was published by royalist supporters of Henri, Count of Paris (1908‚Äì1999). In successive years it took the names Le Courrier 48, Le Courrier 49 and Le Courrier 50. The monarchist paper Ici France was launched in October 1946. In May 1947 it became a 16-page weekly with abundant illustrations mainly concerning the royal family. It disappeared in November 1947. Le Courrier de la Mesnie decided to replace Ici France with the same formula and many of its staff. Le Courrier fran√ßais was launched in March 1948, and was later renamed Courrier 48. The new monthly supported the Count of Paris but did not depend on him for financing. Courier 49 (No. 15) published a letter from Gabriel Marcel to Pierre Boutang on the detention of Charles Maurras. The chief editor was Maurice Colinon and the main contributors were Jacques Baulmier, Ren√© Chissey, Victor-Henry Debidour, Michel de Saint-Pierre, Maurice d‚ÄôOlziac, Guy Coutant de Saisseval and Fran√ßois Chatel.

Le Courrier fran√ßais was one of several ephemeral royalist publications, others being Force populaire, Le Nouveau R√©gime, Lys Rouge and L'Etandard. The journal never had the stature of Ici France. It had smaller circulation, fewer pages and less distinguished contributors. It ceased to appear in June 1950 after the return of the prince, and was never any help to him.

The NIDIS is \\"charged with providing timely information to prevent drought and extreme weather damage.\\" The bill passed in the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress. A similar bill, the National Integrated Drought Information System Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 2431; 113th Congress), was introduced in the United States House of Representatives and considered around the same time. That bill became on March 6, 2014.

Drought Information Act of 2013 would amend the National Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006 to specify that: (1) the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere shall continue to support the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) Program, and (2) the program's purpose shall be to better inform and provide for more timely decisionmaking to reduce drought related impacts and costs. The bill would revise NIDIS functions to require the NIDIS to, among other things: (1) provide certain information (including concerning water supplies and soil moisture), forecasts, and assessments described in the Act on both national and regional levels; and (2) continue ongoing research and monitoring activities related to drought and the role of extreme weather events and climate variability in drought. The bill would require the Under Secretary to provide a report to Congress concerning the NIDIS Program that includes a list of partners with whom the Under Secretary collaborates on NIDIS implementation and a description of NIDIS outreach activities. The bill would authorize appropriations to carry out the Act through Fiscal Year 2018. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on July 30, 2013. This is a public domain source. S. 376 would amend the National Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006. The bill would authorize the appropriation of $14.5 million annually over the 2014-2018 period for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to maintain a system to provide early warnings of droughts by collecting and disseminating information and coordinating research on drought conditions. In 2013, the agency received $12 million to carry out similar activities. Assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the legislation would cost $65 million over the 2014-2018 period and $8 million after 2018. Enacting S. 376 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. S. 376 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Drought Information Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States Senate on February 25, 2013 by Sen. Mark L. Pryor (D, AR). It was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. On October 28, 2013, it was reported by the committee alongside Committee Report 113-114. On February 3, 2014, the Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent. Debate and discussion Senators Mark Pryor, Jerry Moran, John Thune, Tom Udall, and Mark Udall jointly introduced the bill and were all strong supporters.

Kirkwood, and was succeeded by Daniel McCallum in 1854. After the bankruptcy of the Erie in 1859 he was reinstated as general superintendent of the Erie railroad.  Biography  Minot was born at Haverhill, Massachusetts. His father, Stephen Minot (1776‚Äì1861), was a judge of the Massachusetts Supreme Court. Charles Minot was educated for the law, and graduated at Harvard in 1828.William Thomas Davis (1895) Bench and Bar of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. p. 399 However, Minot's mind was of a more practical bent, and he learned to be an engineer on the Boston and Maine Railroad, of which railroad he subsequently became superintendent. Minot was one of the first to learn telegraph, and his knowledge of that new science stood him well in his career as superintendent of the Erie, as we have seen in the account of his adapting the telegraph to the use of the railroad. He came to the Erie from the Boston and Maine Railroad. The Erie was then in operation as far west as Elmira. On May 1, 1850 he became General Superintendent as successor of James P. Kirkwood.Edward Harold Mott Between the Ocean and the Lakes: The Story of Erie. Collins, 1899. p. 430-31 Charles Minot was a large, fleshy man, very democratic in his manner with his men, always meeting them on an apparent equality. He was a bluff and rude man in his speech, and hasty of temper. A peculiarity of his character was that if he summoned any of the men to his office to \\"blow them up,\\" he would deliver his pent-up feelings on the first person who happened to come in, although that one was in no way concerned in the trouble on hand, and perhaps knew nothing about it. Minot's mind relieved, all would be serene again, and when the man he had summoned came in, he would be dismissed without a word. Superintendent Minot was continually travelling over the road. He had no special car or retainers, such as general superintendents of to-day are sumptuously equipped with. \\"Any car is good enough for me,\\" Minot used to say. He frequently travelled with the pay car, to save expense. Until one day in the summer of 1853, he invariably travelled with his car ahead of the engine. He acknowledged that this was a dangerous thing to do, but he said \\"he could see things better.\\" On the day in question, the car jumped the rails near Almond on the Western Division, at a high embankment there. With him on the car was President Homer Ramsdell and H.G. Brooks. Minot was a powerful man. He was standing on the platform as the car left the track. President Rainsdell and Mr. Brooks rushed for the door to escape, but they never would have got out but for Minot, who seized the president with one hand and Brooks with the other, dragged them through the door, and jumped from the car with them just as it toppled over the bank. That was the last trip Minot ever took over the road with his car in front of the locomotive. The democratic manner of Superintendent Minot had made him objectionable to a number of the Directors long before he declined to enforce the McCallum rules, among them President Ramsdell, so although he had proved himself a capable railroad man, his withdrawal in favor of the strict disciplinarian, McCallum, was agreeable to that element in the Board in more ways than one - but it was costly to the Erie. Minot went from the Erie to the Michigan Southern Railroad, as general manager, a place he held until December 1859. Then he was recalled to the general superintendency of the Erie. He remained at the head of the operative department until December 31, 1864, when he was succeeded by Hugh Riddle. For a time Mr. Minot held an office with the Company known as consulting engineer, but he retired from that and returned to his native place, where he died.  Work = Bringing the telegraph into use for railroading  Erie Railroad yard, showing locomotive, switching yard, and the telegraph along the road, 1869-1880. The Erie, through Charles Minot, and through his successor, D. C. McCallum, attracted the eyes of the whole country to the value of the telegraph as a vital agent in the management of railroads, the running of trains, and the safety of passengers. What was known as the New York and Erie Telegraph Line was begun in August, 1847. It was not a work of the New York and Erie Railroad Company.Edward Harold Mott (1899), p. 415 In 1847, Ezra Cornell of Ithaca, New York worked to expand telegraphic communication through the New York and Lake Erie Railroad right-of-way with the Western Union Telegraph Company, saving a telegraph line he built from New York City to Fredonia. The new telegraph was an instant hit, and was commonly used for gossip and casual chatting. Ezra Cornell was the projector of the line, and while he was constructing it through the southern New York counties, taking the wagon roads for his route, Charles Minot was watching him. Minot early saw the value of the telegraph to railroads, and how it might be employed to direct the movement of trains at every point along the road. He induced the Railroad Company to construct a line of telegraph poles and wires along the margin of the railroad, without reference to patents, and without determining the machinery to be employed. It was constructed by the railroad workmen. Mr. Cornell supplied insulators and also Morse machinery for the offices to be opened. The insulators were of brimstone, enclosed in iron pots, and of but small value. On the completion of the Erie telegraph line, Superintendent Minot offered to purchase for the Erie the Morse patent on fair terms. Mr. Smith, one of the owners of the patent, refused to sell. He invited the New York and Erie Railroad Company to become stockholders in the Telegraph Company, and thus acquire the right to use the Morse instruments. By this time, however, the Cornell line had so shown its unreliable character that Mr. Minot declined the invitation. He wrote, also, very placidly to Mr. Smith that his notion was that, after its completion, \\"our Company would make arrangements with the New York and Erie Telegraph Company to work it for us.\\" After a short struggle against circumstances the wire of the Cornell line was, in 1852 and 1853, transferred from the poles along the turnpikes to those of the Railroad Company, and by gradual processes the line became massed with and faded into the property of that Company. In 1852 the title of the company was changed to The New York and Western Union Telegraph.  The telegraph system at Erie  The novelty and importance of applying the telegraph to the running of its trains by the Erie did not begin to attract general attention until 1855. In his report for that year, John T. Clark, in his function as New York State Engineer and Surveyor, referred to this innovation at length. As his statements describe accurately the system of operation on the Erie that had gradually developed under the telegraphic adjunct, and which, modified and improved by Superintendent Minot and his successor, Daniel McCallum, eventually became the standard system on railroads everywhere, they are reproduced here as interesting and valuable historic data:Edward Harold Mott (1899), p. 421 :The telegraph has been in use on the Erie since 1852 [meaning practically]. By the concurrent testimony of the superintendents of the road, it has saved more than it cost every year. There is an operator at every station on the line, and at the important ones day and night, so placed that they have a fair view of the track. They are required to note the exact time of the arrival, departure, or passage of every train, and to transmit the same by telegraph to the proper officer. On each division there is an officer called train despatcher, whose duty it is to keep constantly before him a memorandum of the position of every train upon his division, as ascertained by the telegraphic reports from the several stations. The trains are run upon this road by printed time-tables and regulations. When they become disarranged, the telegraph is also used to disentangle and move them forward. When trains upon any part of this road are delayed, the fact is immediately communicated to the nearest station, and from there by telegraph to every station on the road. Approaching trains are thus warned of the danger, and accidents from this cause are prevented.John T. Clark (1855) in his annual report as New York State Engineer. Cited in: Edward Harold Mott (1899), p. 421 :When one or more of the trains from any general cause, like that of snow storms, etc., have been retarded and are likely to produce delays on the other trains, the train despatcher is authorized to move them forward by telegraph under certain rules which have been arranged for that purpose. Having before him a schedule of the time of the passage of each train at its last station, he can determine its position at any desired moment with sufficient accuracy for his present purpose, and can adopt the best means of extricating the delayed trains and of regulating the movement of all so as to avoid any danger of collision or further entanglement. He then telegraphs to such stations as are necessary, giving orders to some trains to lay by for a certain period, or until certain trains have passed, and to others to proceed to certain stations and there await further orders. :To prevent any error or misunderstanding between the despatcher and the conductor of the train, he is required to write his order in the telegraph operator's book. The operator who receives the message is required to write it upon his book, and to fill up two printed copies, one of which he hands to the conductor of the train, and one to the engineman. The despatcher then transmits a message to the conductor, asking him the question : \\" How do you understand my message?\\" To which the conductor must make reply in his own words, repeating the substance of the message as he understands it, to detect any error which may be made by the operator, or of his own understanding of it. If this is satisfactory to the despatcher, he telegraphs, \\" All right, go ahead ! \\" and until this final message is received, no trains can be moved on the road by telegraph. Time is saved by using abbreviations for stations and messages, trains, etc. :In this way, if a passenger train is delayed an hour or more, all freight trains which would be held by it at the several stations under the general rules are moved forward to such other passing places as they are certain to reach before the delayed trains could overtake them, and thus it frequently happens that in a single day the trains which would otherwise be delayed, are moved forward by telegraph, the equivalent to the use of two or three engines and trains. The blank orders that were the basis of telegraphic running of trains originated with Superintendent McCallum, in 1854. They became famous as \\" Blank 31,\\" \\" Blank 32,\\" and \\" Blank A.\\" The use of Blank 31 came under Rule 12 of the McCallum code, which was that \\"when a meeting place is to be made for trains moving in contrary directions, the right to run shall be made certain, positive, and defined, without regard to time.\\"  Train dispatching  Time table, Erie Railroad 1851. Charles Minot as Division Superintendent on the Erie Railroad is credited with the first effort to control the movement of a train beyond the rule book and operating timetable, when, in September 1851, he sent a telegram to a railroad employee at another location directing that all trains be held at that point until the train Minot was riding could arrive. On September 22, 1851, Minot was in a parked passenger train at Turner Station. He glanced out the window of the train and saw the new telegraph wires. Departing the train, Minot ran into the station, got on the new telegraph, and wired the next station along the line, Monroe, to see if the eastbound train to Piermont-on-Hudson had gone past. The station agent said no. At that point, Minot ordered the engineer of the train to proceed on their way to Goshen. The engineer refused to take Minot's order, and instead, Minot got into the cab car himself and drove the train himself to Port Jervis, hours ahead of the planned scheduled time of arrival. This was the second of the several \\"firsts\\" the Erie Railroad created in its time, along with the shipment of milk by rail at Chester station in 1842. Minot further developed a system using telegraphs for train dispatches, for use when trains would want to pass one another along the line, such as at stations. Two-letter telegraph codes were designated, and the new modern system was set up. For the ten years of the new railroad's existence, passengers had been disgusted as trains waited for hours as another train had to pass them. This new system would relieve this issue. From that beginning, a system of train dispatching evolved. The operating rule book, later standardized for all railroads, contained the basic rules for the operation of trains, such as the meaning of the all fixed, audible and hand signals; the form, format and meaning of train orders; and the duties and obligations of each class of employee. The operating, or official, timetable established train numbers and schedules; meeting points for those trains; showed the length of passing tracks at each station as well as indicating the locations where train orders might be issued and contained a variety of other information which might be necessary or useful to train crews operating trains over the territory covered. The use of the telegraph and Minot's system remained until 1888, when a new system of block signaling, developed by the competitor Pennsylvania Railroad, helped expand Minot's use of telecommunications to control rail traffic.

TowerMadness 2 has game controller support. Gameplay The objective in TowerMadness 2 is to defend a base filled with a flock of sheep from waves of aliens by destroying the aliens with diverse weapons in the form of towers. UFOs drop invading aliens on landing pads and the waves of enemies make their way to the base to abduct the sheep. Each wave arrives in intervals, or all waves can be sent at once if Invasion Mode is enabled. The goal of each alien is to abduct one sheep. The player destroys the aliens by building towers. Each enemy destroyed provides the player with more in-game coins to build new towers and upgrade existing towers. Once all waves of enemies are destroyed or all sheep have been abducted, the game ends and you earn a certain number of stars and wool. Stars rate how well a player did on each map based on how many sheep were saved, with the highest being four stars for completing a map with no sheep lost and with Invasion Mode enabled. Without Invasion Mode enabled, the highest possible stars earned are three. Wool, the in-game currency, is rewarded for completing or failing each map. This can be used to unlock additional towers and tower levels in Xen‚Äôs Laboratory, the in-game shop. There are four game modes: Normal, Endless, Invasion, and Classic. In Normal Mode, there is a set number of enemy waves to destroy and UFOs arrive in intervals. In Endless Mode, there are an endless number of waves to defeat. A player's score is determined by the number of waves survived. In Invasion Mode, all UFOs are sent as quickly as possible, and the rounds have a bonus of +25% wool. If a player can win without losing any sheep, four stars are rewarded. In Classic Mode, all maps and towers are unlocked. Reception TowerMadness 2 received generally positive reviews. Upon release, Appsgoer proclaims \\"you will be rewarded with an addictive, occasionally challenging strategy-demanding game.\\" Android Central mentions \\"Beyond just the gameplay, this developer is doing all of the right things.\\" Well-known app review site, Pocket Gamer, explains that \\"The game also balances its cheeky humour well with stages that will seriously challenge your forward-planning abilities.\\" TouchArcade praises it as \\"an excellent tower defense game and expands upon the original in every fact\\".
