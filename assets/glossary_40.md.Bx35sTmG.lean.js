Men's and women's were similar. At the beginning of the 17th century, both women and men wore a thin, ribbon-like . By the 1680s, the width of women's had already doubled from its original size. In the 1730s women's were about wide, and at the turn of the 19th century were as wide as . At that time, separate ties and cords were already necessary to hold the in place.

The mode of attaching the sleeve widely to the torso part of the garment would have prevented the use of wider . When the sleeves of the began to grow in width (i.e. in length) at the beginning of the Edo period, the widened as well. There were two reasons for this: firstly, to maintain the aesthetic balance of the outfit, the longer sleeves needed a wider sash to accompany them; secondly, unlike today (where they are customary only for unmarried women) married ladies also wore long- sleeved kimono in the 1770s. The use of long sleeves without leaving the underarm open would have hindered movements greatly. These underarm openings in turn made room for even wider . Originally, all were tied in the front. Later, fashion began to affect the position of the knot, and could be tied to the side or to the back. As grew wider the knots grew bigger, and it became cumbersome to tie the in the front.

At the end of the 18th century it was fashionable for a woman's to have overly long hems that were allowed to trail behind when in house. For moving outside, the excess cloth was tied up beneath the with a wide cloth ribbon called .

Amphiprion ocellaris are found in different colors, depending on where they are located. For example, black Amphiprion ocellaris with white bands can be found near northern Australia, Southeast Asia, and Japan. Orange or red-brown Amphiprion ocellaris also exist with three similar white bands on the body and head. Amphiprion ocellaris can be distinguished from other Amphriphon species based on the number of pectoral rays and dorsal spines. Amphiprion ocellaris are known to grow about 110 mm long. Like many other fish species, females are, however, larger than males. The life cycle of Amphiprion ocellaris varies in whether they reside at the surface or bottom of the ocean. When they initially hatch, they reside near the surface. However, when Amphiprion ocellaris enter into the juvenile stage of life, they travel down to the bottom to find shelter in a host anemone. Once they find their anemone, they form a symbiotic relationship with them. Phylogeny Purple anemone (Heteractis magnifica) and resident anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris) in East Timor. The species Amphiprion ocellaris belongs to the class Actinopterygii which contains bony Teleost fish and other ray-finned fish. A. ocellaris is the most basal species in the genus Amphiprion which is closely related to the genus Premnas. The species' most closely related ancestor is Amphiprion percula, the Orange clownfish. It is thought that A. ocellaris specialized after diverging from the genus Premnas, and scientific evidence confirms that all clownfish belonging to the genus Amphiprion initially could withstand the stings of only one type of anemone; after further speciation the 28 different species of clownfish including A. ocellaris have specialized to be able to resist the poisonous stings of many different anemone species. Description The common clownfish is a small fish which grows up to 11 cm (4.3 inches). Its body has a stocky appearance and oval shape. It is compressed laterally, with a round profile. The coloration of its body is orange to reddish-brown, but it can also be black in some particular areas such as the Northern Territory in Australia.Allen, Marine Fishes of Tropical Australia and South-East Asia,Western Australian Museum,1997, It has three vertical white stripes outlined with a fine black line. The first passes just behind the eye, the second in the middle of the body widens forward to the head centrally and the third one circles the caudal peduncle. All the fins are also outlined with a fine black line. A. ocellaris is often confused with Amphiprion percula, which possesses exactly the same colours and patterns at first sight but distinguishes itself by the thickness of the black outlines. Additionally, A. ocellaris has a taller dorsal fin, and typically possesses 11 dorsal-fin spines vs. 10 spines in Amphiprion percula.Dianne J. Bray, 2011, Western Clown Anemonefish, Amphiprion ocellaris, in Fishes of Australia, accessed 25 Aug 2014, http://www.fishesofaustralia.net.au/Home/species/1275 Distribution and habitat This species is found in the Eastern Indian Ocean and in the western Pacific Ocean. As mentioned earlier, they can also be found in Northern Australia, Southeast Asia and Japan. Amphiprion ocellaris typically lives in small groups on outer reef slopes or in sheltered lagoons at a maximal depth of 15 meters. It inhabits three different species of sea anemones: Heteractis magnifica, Stichodactyla gigantea and Stichodactyla mertensii and have symbiotic relationships with the anemone. Behavior A. ocellaris is a diurnal fish. It is a protandrous hermaphrodite, which means the male can change its sex to female during its life, and lives in a harem in which an established dominance hierarchy manages the group and keeps individuals at a specific social rank. It is aggressively territorial and is completely dependent on its sea anemone. =Shelter= A. ocellaris are reliant on sea anemone for shelter (they have a symbiotic relationship with the sea anemone). Sea anemone are protection for the fish and their nests. This is because when A. ocellaris are in the open waters, they have a higher risk of predation. It is postulated that the fanning behavior of the fish and removal of parasites promotes the health of sea anemones which contain A. ocellaris fish. In addition, the anemone provides protection for the fish with its tentacles, however, the fish's mucus protection prevents it from being stung by the tentacles.Allen, G. 1997. Marine Fishes of Tropical Australia and South-East Asia. Perth: Western Australian Museum.Myers, R. 1999. Miconesian Reef Fish: A Field Guide for Divers and Aquarists. Barrigada: Territory of Guam: Coral Graphics. The presence of the clownfish can be interpreted as a lure to attract potential anemone's preys close to the tentacles. And the clownfish can also defend the anemone against some reef fishes which could eat the tentacles. =Social system= rightthumb Ocellaris clownfish in the National Marine Aquarium, Plymouth Social systems can be defined as society considered as a system organized by a characteristic pattern of relationships.\\"social system.\\" WordNet 3.0, Farlex clipart collection. 2003-2008. Princeton University, Clipart.com, Farlex Inc. 6 Dec. 2013 http://www.thefreedictionary.com/social+system A. ocellaris form specific social hierarchies within their societies. These social hierarchies result in competition to travel between the different levels of society, which is seen between various ages as well. Queue selection Queues is the term for social groups of A. ocellaris. This is because these fish form social hierarchies, or social rank, by ‚Äúoutliving‚Äù the more dominant members of the group. The dominant pair of each queue reproduces more compared to the subordinate fishes. This is the reason for why these individuals should adopt various tactics in which they increase their probability of attaining social dominance. There are two types of A. ocellaris, settlers and switchers. Settlers prefer shorter queues, while switchers will usually move after settlement. However, studies show that there is no difference in the characteristics between switchers and non-switchers, and there is no data demonstrating that A. ocellaris utilize the switching tactic for dominance. Although settlement preferences increase the likelihood of gaining social dominance, switching could have the function of increasing social dominance benefits after social dominance has been acquired.Mitchell, Jeremy. \\"Queue Selection and Switching by False Clown Anemonefish, Amphiprion Ocellaris.\\" Animal Behavior 69 (2005): 643-52. Science Direct. Web. Juvenile Amphiprion ocellaris Juvenile A. ocellaris have difficulty finding a sea anemone to live in (since they need anemone for survival and shelter). The difficulty also arises in the fact that there exists a hierarchy in each anemone. Thus, when a new juvenile enters an anemone, it begins at the bottom of the social ladder where it is often the victim of aggression by other clownfish. This aggression from other A. ocellaris in the anemone can cause the juvenile to be chased out of the anemone, and left to search for another anemoneArvedlund, M., L. Nielsen. 1996.

Reproduction in Reef Fishes. New Jersey: T.F.H. Publications, Inc.. Group size and patch size Studies have shown that there is a correlation between the size of the group and the size of the patch; however this correlation provides no implication that subordinate group members have less resources. More likely, it is the effects of the patch size on the group member that dominates interactions. An experiment was performed to study the mechanism responsible for the positive correlation between the group size and patch size. The scientists argued that the correlation between the group size and patch size is because of the indirect consequence of the positive relationship between the dominant group member's length and the anemone size. The length of the dominant group member limits the group size because the length of the dominant group member prevents the group of the subordinate group members. This data shows that the patch size and group size correlation does not necessarily imply the decrease in resources of group members subordinate to the dominant group member.J.S. Mitchell1,2 and L.M. Dill. Behavioural Ecology Research Group, Department of Biological Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada. =Food habits= A. ocellaris feed on plankton and algae, thus they are considered omnivores. Feeding is also affected by the hierarchy in A. ocellaris groups. Since the smaller, less dominant fish face aggression from the more aggressive fish, they have less energy to forage for food. Thus, they usually do not eat as much as the dominant fish do, because of reduced energy, but also because of the increased danger they face when they leave their anemone since they are smaller. In other words, the larger fish will usually travel farther than the smaller fish. Generally, the A. ocellaris feed on algae, copepods, and zooplankton.Sano, M., M. Shimizu, Y. Nose. 1984. Food habits of teleostean reef fishes in Okinawa Island, Southern Japan. Japan: University of Tokyo Press. =Reproduction and life history= A. ocellaris have reproductive behaviors very similar to that of all anemonefish. They have monogamous mating systems, and in their spawning processes, they also have different levels of aggressiveness between males and females. In addition, there is a reproductive hierarchy that exists between age and sex. Clownfish are initially male; the largest fish in a group becomes female. Spawning There is not much data on the reproduction of A. ocellaris. However, similar behaviors throughout all anemone fishes have been recorded. These fish have monogamous mating systems, and are territorial of their anemone. Males become more aggressive during spawning. Male behavior also changes to attract females: biting, chasing, fin extension. Before spawning, the male prepares the nest near the anemone (so that the tentacles of the anemone can protect the nest). After the male chases the female to the nest, the female begins the spawning process. She lays eggs for about one to two hours, and then leave the nest for the male to fertilize the eggs. The eggs take approximately six to eight days to hatch (this time period can be affected by the temperature of water). Because of the external fertilization, males usually care for the eggs. They also have responsibilities for eating fungi-infected or infertile eggs, and fanning the eggs. Reproductive hierarchy The males can change sex to female during their lives, and live in a harem in which an established dominance hierarchy manages the group and keeps individuals at a specific social rank. All anemonefish are protandrous hermaphrodites, meaning they first develop into males and may become females later in life. Anemonefish exhibit phenotypic plasticity when males, females, and juveniles inhabit the same anemone. In an anemonefish social group, the female is the dominant and largest member, followed by the dominant male, while other anemonefish remain non-reproductive.Fricke, H., S. Fricke. 1977. Monogamy and sex change by aggressive dominance in coral reef fish. Nature, 266: 830-832. One experiment placed three juvenile anemonefish in a tank and observed their behaviors over the course of a month. The researchers drew conclusions about the fish's social hierarchy based on signs of dominance such as aggressive or appeasing behaviors, occupation of territory in the tank, and body mass increase. The dominant fish grew larger compared to lower-ranked fish, suggesting the lower- ranked fish experienced growth suppression. In addition, a difference in the fish's levels of certain steroids suggested that lower-ranked individuals also experienced reproductive suppression.Iwata, Eri, Yukiko Nagai, Mai Hyoudou, and Hideaki Sasaki. \\"Social Environment and Sex Differentiation in the False Clown Anemonefish, Amphiprion ocellaris.\\" Zoological Science 25.2 (2008): 123-28. Print. Another experiment demonstrated that when a female anemonefish is removed from the anemone, then the dominant male becomes the female and the next-highest-ranked male moves up the dominance hierarchy to become the dominant male. Females use aggressive dominance behavior to control the males, preventing the formation of other females, and dominant males prevent juvenile males from mating. In aquaria In nature, the false percula clownfish is hosted by Heteractis magnifica and Stichodactyla gigantea. However, in captivity in a reef aquarium, the false percula is hosted by other species of anemone, including Entacmaea quadricolor. In addition, clownfish may adopt a surrogate host as opposed to an anemone, such as Euphyllia divisa, xenia coral, etc. Human interaction A. ocellaris are utilized as part of the tropical fish aquarium trade. However, only certain colors are in demand. In addition, A. ocellaris are used in research since they can be bred easily.Sadovy, Y., A. Vincent (2002). \\"Ecological Issue and the Trade in Live Reef Fishes\\". pp. 395 in P Sale, ed. Coral Reef Fishes. San Diego, California: Academic Press. This high demand in trade has been dangerous for A. ocellaris population due to overexploitation. In popular culture The protagonists Marlin and his son Nemo from the animated film Finding Nemo, and its sequel Finding Dory, are Ocellaris clownfish.

It originally aired on the WB in the United States on October 5, 2000. The episode was written by series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and directed by Lesli Linka Glatter. The episode introduces the two main characters, Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) and her daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel), as well as Lorelai's parents (Kelly Bishop and Edward Herrmann) and residents of Stars Hollow. After Rory is accepted to the prestigious Chilton Preparatory School, Lorelai is forced to go to her wealthy parents for financial assistance. Her parents happily loan their daughter the money in exchange for an end to the estrangement and a family dinner every Friday night. Unfortunately, things hit a snag when a cute new transfer student flirts with Rory, leading the younger Gilmore to wonder whether leaving Stars Hollow High is really what she wants. Plot The show begins with shots introducing Stars Hollow, Connecticut, home of Lorelai and Rory Gilmore. Lorelai is a 32-year-old single mother who is so close to her 15-year-old daughter, Rory, that many people mistake them for sisters. The show opens at the local diner Luke's, run by Luke Danes (Scott Paterson), where the girls go every morning. Lorelai has a special relationship with the owner and an addiction to caffeine. She squares off with the owner on a daily basis over just how much coffee she's allowed to have. While getting coffee, an unsuspecting male hits on both of the Gilmore girls, separately. This displays some of the quirky problems the Gilmore girls have. Clearly, there are hazards in being a mother and daughter pair so close in age. Next, the scene shifts to Lorelai working at the Independence Inn. There's Michel Gerard (Yanic Truesdale), a rude French man who runs the front desk, an unbelievably sassy harp player, and Sookie St. James (Melissa McCarthy), the chef. Meanwhile, we find out that Rory is the kind of girl who is more interested in academic pursuits and reading Madame Bovary, than worrying about clothes and boys. But unbeknownst to Rory there is a new guy in town, and he has his eyes set on her. Rory and her best friend, Lane Kim (Keiko Agena) hang out after school and discuss an upcoming teen hayride. Rory wouldn't be caught dead at the event, but Lane has strict parents who are trying to set her up with the son of a business colleague. The real story is that Rory hears she has been accepted to the exclusive prep school Chilton, which typically means guaranteed admission to Harvard. Rory is psyched, but Lorelai gets a rude awakening: the school wants a pricey enrollment fee in addition to first semester's tuition. And they want it pronto. Lorelai doesn't have the money, but can't bear the thought of disappointing her daughter. The only thing left for her to do is ask her wealthy parents. But that's not such an easy task since Lorelai's relationship with her parents is beyond strained. As a teenager, Lorelai didn't exactly fulfill her parent's high expectations. Lorelai does indeed end up asking her parents for money, where she receives quite the chilly reception. When she asks for the money, they agree, since it is really for Rory, but have one minor condition. Lorelai's mother, Emily Gilmore (Kelly Bishop), demands that she get to see her daughter and granddaughter once a week. That means dinner every Friday night. Lorelai hesitates, but agrees. At school, Rory is explaining to Lane about Chilton when she bumps into Dean Forester (Jared Padalecki), the new kid from Chicago who has been eyeing Rory. They talk and Rory begins to really like Dean. Just how hard she falls for him isn't revealed until later when she tells her mom that she doesn't want to go to Chilton anymore. Lorelai is confused and astounded, but Rory doesn't back down. When the truth comes out, Lorelai flips out and says she will not allow her daughter to throw her life away for some random guy. Rory is going to Chilton whether she wants to or not. When the Gilmore girls go to the grandparents' house for dinner, the whole night turns into a big disaster. Lorelai's father starts talking about Rory's dad, Christopher, and all the success he has had with his Internet startup in California. This causes Lorelai to have a mini-breakdown. She and Emily end up fighting in the kitchen, and Rory overhears every word... including the part about paying for Chilton. When it's all over, Rory recognizes her mom's bravery and agrees to go to Chilton. The episode ends with the Gilmore Girls sitting in Luke's diner talking. Production =Development= The pilot episode received financial support from the script development fund of the Family Friendly Programming Forum, which includes some of the nation's leading advertisers, making it one of the first network shows to reach the air with such funding. Luke Danes, portrayed by Scott Patterson was initially supposed to be a woman in the pilot's original script. Additionally, several minor characters such as Judy Tolan and Mrs. Langworthy were cut from the original script and multiple scenes were switched around or merged. Featured music included \\"There She Goes\\" by The La's, \\"I Try\\" by Macy Gray, \\"Where the Colors Don't Go\\" by Sam Phillips, \\"My Little Corner Of The World\\" by Yo La Tengo, \\"Wendy\\" by Wesley Yang & Gavin McNett, \\"Ballet Waltz #3\\" by Herman Beeftink, and \\"Heartland\\" by George Strait. =Filming= Unionville's Main Street, where the pilot was filmed The pilot was shot in Unionville, Ontario near Toronto while the rest of the series was filmed in Burbank, California at the Warner Bros. lot. =Unaired pilot= The series was approved though the original pilot never aired, and continued the same story with some changes to the main cast. In the \\"Unaired pilot\\", the character Sookie St. James was played by Alex Borstein and the character of Dean Forester was played by Nathan Wetherington. Alex Borstein's MADtv contract prevented her from continuing in the role, which was recast with Melissa McCarthy. Borstein made recurring appearances on Gilmore Girls throughout the show's run, first as the harpist Drella, then as Miss Celine and Doris. Reception On the original airing of this episode, Gilmore Girls set network records for its time period in women 18-34 (2.9/9), women 18-49 (2.7/8) and households (3.5/6). It also tied the network mark for its timeslot in adults 18-34 (2.2/7). While rewatching the series, David Sims of The A.V. Club called it \\"a pretty strong piece of television\\". He concluded his review, writing: \\"The pilot just gives us the basics, but this heady poultice is already brewing away.\\" References External links * * Category:Gilmore Girls episodes Category:2000 American television episodes Gilmore Girls ","title":"Pilot (Gilmore Girls)"},{"id":"2516362","text":"Norman Collings Fletcher (December 8, 1917 ‚Äì May 31, 2007) was an American architect who was a co-founder and partner of the architectural firm The Architects' Collaborative (TAC), working there from 1945 until the firm's demise in 1995.

The chapel is under the episcopal see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix and its ministry is conducted by St. John Vianney Parish, Sedona.  History  The chapel was inspired and commissioned by local rancher and sculptor Marguerite Brunswig Staude, who had been inspired in 1932 by the newly constructed Empire State Building to build such a church. After an attempt to do so in Budapest, Hungary (with the help of Lloyd Wright, son of architect Frank Lloyd Wright) was abandoned due to the outbreak of World War II, she decided to build the church in her native region. Richard Hein was chosen as project architect, and the design is by architect August K. Strotz, both from the firm of Anshen & Allen. The chapel is built on Coconino National Forest land; the late Senator Barry Goldwater assisted Staude in obtaining a special-use permit. The construction supervisor was Fred Courkos, who built the chapel in 18 months at a cost of US$300,000. The chapel was completed in 1956. The American Institute of Architects gave the Chapel its Award of Honor in 1957. In the sculptor's words, \\"Though Catholic in faith, as a work of art the Chapel has a universal appeal. Its doors will ever be open to one and all, regardless of creed, that God may come to life in the souls of all men and be a living reality.\\"http://www.sedonacentralreservations.com/chapel-of-the-holy- cross.aspx In 2007, Arizonans voted the Chapel to be one of the Seven Man-Made Wonders of Arizona.  Architectural features  Upon arrival, visitors walk up a ramp from the parking area to the chapel. The long, curved ramp is constructed of textured concrete. The main feature of the chapel is a 90 ft (27.4 m) tall iron cross on the southwestern wall, which serves both aesthetic and structural purposes. A sculptress by the name of Marguerite Staude was inspired by the powerful image of the steel framework in the Empire State building and other skyscrapers. Her idea for the cross was carried out by sculptor Keith Monroe, from San Francisco. The cross holds both the altar and Corpus on the interior. The walls and cross are constructed with reinforced coarse-aggregate concrete, 1 foot (0,3 m) in thickness. Inside and out, the walls were sandblasted to unveil the textured aggregate. To reduce glare, smokey-gray colored glass is utilized at the two ends of the chapel. The floor is made of concrete, which is trowel-finished. The front doors are constructed of aluminum with horn-shaped handles. The effect of the materials pallet combined with the simple, angled shapes in the chapel create an impression of grandeur and strength. This is fitting, as it sits at the base of a 1,500 ft (457,2 m) cliff and is surrounded by massive pieces of sandstone. The chapel seats up to 150 people. The confessional, office, two sacristies and services are located in the basement of the building.

These two former sponsors of the FFM/WFF called for proposals for a new film festival and ultimately shifted their funding to the New Montreal FilmFest, which was inaugurated in October 2005. The New Montreal FilmFest, produced by Spectra Entertainment (owners of the Montreal Spectrum theater), was initially headed by Daniel Langlois, founder of SoftImage (subsequently sold to Microsoft) and Ex-Centris. Langlois had previously directed the Montreal Festival of New Cinema and New Media‚ÄîFestival de Nouveau Cinema et Nouveaux Media, which was renamed Festival du Nouveau Cin√©ma in 2004 (Montreal's independent film festival). The involvement of Langlois intended to counter prior criticisms of lack of professionalism in the FFM/WFF (run by Serge Losique) and to merge the FCMM (renamed the FNC in 2004) and the New Montreal FilmFest into one new festival. The FNC would not agree to such a merger, and scheduling conflicts between the New Montreal FilmFest and the FNC led to Langlois' early departure from FilmFest. The 2005 event was eventually directed by Moritz de Hadeln, who had previously headed the Locarno International Film Festival, the Berlin International Film Festival, the Venice International Film Festival--and founded the Visions du R√©el documentary film festival of Nyon, Switzerland.

It is found in moist mid-elevation forests from eastern Panama to northern Bolivia. The golden-headed quetzal is known for its iridescent green colour, which it shares with other quetzals, and its distinctive golden head. The female of the species is less brightly coloured, displaying more brown tones than the male. The golden-headed quetzal's diet consists mainly of fruit, and occasionally insects. It is generally a solitary and quiet bird unless it is breeding season, when the male and female become a monogamous pair and create a cavity nest in an old tree. During breeding season both sexes share brooding and feeding duties for 25‚Äì30 days until the chick is ready to fledge. The golden-headed quetzal is fairly common and considered a species of least concern.

The word quetzal comes from the Nahuatl (the Aztec language) word quetzalli (from the root quetz meaning \\"stand\\"), which translates to \\"long green plume\\" or \\"tail feather of the quetzal\\".Bierhorst, J. 1985. A Nahuatl-English dictionary and concordance to the cantares mexicanos. California: Stanford University Press. Quetzal is usually specifically used to refer to the resplendent quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno) first described by Pablo de la Llave in 1832 but in reality it applies to all members of the genera Pharomachrus and Euptilotis.Quetzal. 1890. In: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica a dictionary of arts, sciences, and general literature. Chicago: R. S. Peale & Co. p. 179-180. Pharomachrus, coined by Pablo de la Llave, stems from Ancient Greek pharos meaning \\"mantle\\" or \\"cloak\\" and makros meaning \\"long\\" in reference to the impressive tail of the resplendent quetzal.Gotch AF. 1981. Birds: their Latin names explained. Blanford Press. Two subspecies are recognized, P. a. auriceps (Gould, 1842) and P. a. hargitti (Oustalet, 1891).Integrated taxonomic information system [Internet]. [cited 2015 Oct 17]. Available from: https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search;_value=554487# The species name, auriceps, comes from Latin aurum meaning \\"gold\\" and ceps meaning \\"crowned\\" or \\"headed\\", in reference to the golden head of Pharomachrus auriceps.Peru birds [Internet]. [cited 2015 Oct 17]. Available from: http://www.peruaves.org/trogonidae/golden-headed-quetzal-pharomachrus- auriceps/  Description  260pxThe golden-headed quetzal weighs between 154-182g. It has a wingspan of 30‚Äì36 cm and a length of 33‚Äì36 cm with tail plumes adding another 8‚Äì10 cm. Like other members of the genus Pharomachrus, the golden-headed quetzal is known for its iridescent golden-green wings and breast, which can appear blue depending on the light. The female's breast is a duller brownish colour; her head is also a duller golden-brown when compared to the male's gold-bronze head, from which the species name is derived. Their bills are short and broad; they appear yellow in males and a brownish greyish in females. The quetzal's uppertail coverts are darker green and extend beyond the tip of the tail, more so in the male than in the female. Both the male and the female have a black undertail, though the female sometimes displays greyish-black tips. The feathers on the lower breast of both sexes are a brilliant red colour. Both sexes, like other trogons, also have heterodactyl feet, with the first and second toes facing backwards and the third and fourth toes facing forward. Their legs and feet are an olive green or a brownish colour. The young golden-headed quetzal is a brownish black colour with a few iridescent green feathers on the neck and breast, and lacking the tail coverts of the adult. The golden-headed male quetzal differs from other quetzals in its lack of a crest of head feathers.Johnsgard PA. 2000. Trogons and quetzals of the world. Washington: Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Press. P. a. hargitti is distinguished from the nominate race by its longer tail and slightly more golden colour.  Habitat and Distribution  Golden-headed quetzals inhabit areas of Central and South America. P. a. auriceps is found in eastern Panama (Cerro Pirre mountain) as well as in the Andes spanning from southern Colombia to eastern Peru and northern Bolivia. P. a. hargitti is only found in the Andes of Venezuela. Their natural habitat is most commonly humid and wet moderate-elevation montane and foothill forests although they have also been seen less frequently on the forest edge and in clearings as well as in temperate cloud forests and elfin forests. They reside at elevations ranging from 1200m to 3100m.  Behaviour  = Vocalizations = The golden- headed quetzal is a quiet bird, often sitting quietly motionless for long periods of time.Ridgely RS, Gwynne JA. 1989. A guide to the birds of Panama. Second edition. Princeton (NJ): Princeton University Press.Hilty SL. 2003. Birds of Venezuela. Princeton (NJ): Princeton University Press. When it does vocalize, its far-carrying call is very distinctive, sounding like mournful, hawk-like whistles, repeated 6-8 times (\\"whe-wheeu, whe-wheuu, whe-wheeu‚Ä¶\\"). Its other calls are a horse-like whinnying (\\"why-dy-dy-dy-dyyrrr\\", \\"hoo- whoooooy\\") and a throaty melancholy \\"ka-kaaaur\\". All birds in the family Trogonidae appear to be very responsive to recordings of their calls, which could indicate that their vocalizations are a territorial behaviour. = Diet = The golden-headed quetzal's diet consists mainly of fruit, though it has also been known to eat insects. Remsen et al. (1993) found that the stomach contents of P. auriceps were \\"fruit only\\" 87.5% of the time and \\"arthropods and fruit\\" 12.5% of the time.Remsen JV, Hyde MA, Chapman A. 1993. The diets of neotropical trogons, motmots, barbets, and toucans. The Condor. 95(1): 178-192. The quetzal's fruit-heavy diet makes it a very important species for the dispersal of the fruits‚Äô seeds. It is also thought that, like other quetzals, the golden-headed quetzal feeds on small vertebrates such as frogs and lizards. However, this has been brought into question by Lohnes and Greeney (2008) who found the diet of P. auriceps was much less varied since they never observed it feeding on any animal matter other than insects while observing the species for 22 days. Their observations also confirmed that the formerly accepted idea that quetzals did not feed their hatchlings fruit until ten days after hatching was untrue.Lohnes RG, Greeney HF. 2008. Brooding behavior and nestling description of Golden-headed Quetzal Pharomachrus auriceps. Cotinga. 30(2008): 47-50. = Reproduction = Golden-headed quetzals are usually solitary birds but, during breeding, they are seasonally monogamous. The male attracts the female by establishing a territory and advertising it by singing. Once a pair is formed they must find a suitable location for their nest and share the work of excavating it. All trogons are cavity-nesters; golden-headed quetzals specifically excavate decaying tree trunks with their beaks or modify existing hollow spots in old trees. Quetzals form shallow, more open, unlined cavities from which part of the bird (head or tail) is usually visible. It can be difficult for the quetzal to find an appropriate site for their nest since the dead tree must be soft enough for them to carve but not too rotten as to be unable to support their nest. For this reason quetzals investigate multiple trees before finding a suitable site. The copulatory behaviour of quetzals is not well known since they appear to be discreet in their mating. The golden-headed quetzal has been observed breeding once a year between the months of February and June. The female lays 1-2 pale blue eggs and then incubates them the majority of the time (18‚Äì19 days of incubation) except for one long daily incubation period undertaken by the male. Golden-headed quetzals remain in the nest for 25‚Äì30 days before fledging. They are born blind and naked, like all trogons, and it is at about 3 days before fledging that the nestling develops its final juvenile plumage appearing mostly brown and black but with visible green plumage, particularly on the nape, upper back, and throat. Brooding duties are shared equally between the male and female golden-headed quetzal. The first 8‚Äì14 days after hatching, adults are present in the nest and brooding 60-90% of each day, after which brooding drops rapidly. There appears to be no clear pattern to when the female or male broods, however, it was observed that the male consistently broods for longer near the start of the brooding period, while the female broods more near the end of that period. It is also believed that it is exclusively the female quetzal that broods at night. Feeding duties are also shared equally between the sexes, with the non-brooding adult arriving with food before changing places with the brooding adult. When changing places, the adults seem to observe a ritual, with the incoming adult perching above the nest and emitting a whinnying call to signal the brooding adult to depart the nest. While brooding, the adults enter the nest to feed the nestling; when brooding ends, the adults initially continue to enter the nest but spend less time inside before leaving; at 8 days before fledging they simply lean in to feed the chick before departing; finally at 4‚Äì6 days before fledging the chick is able to perch on the lip of the nest and is fed from there before the adult departs. The food the adults bring to the nestling is usually insects, but also fruit. On the day of fledging the chick perches at the front of the nest and flies away, remaining near the nest for some time before leaving the area. Unlike other trogons, but like other quetzals, the golden-headed quetzal seems to maintain a clean nest by either removing or more often swallowing all droppings.  Status and Conservation  The golden- headed quetzal is fairly common in its range and is considered a species of least concern.Pharomachrus auriceps. 2012.

An inductive sensor connected to a conditioning electronic circuit constitutes a search coil magnetometer. It is a vector magnetometer which can measure one or more components of the magnetic field. A classical configuration uses three orthogonal inductive sensors. The search-coil magnetometer can measure magnetic field from mHz up to hundreds of MHz.  Principle  The inductive sensor is based on Faraday's law of induction. The temporal variation of the Magnetic Flux \\\\Phi through a N turns circuit will induce a voltage e which follows : e = - N\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm d \\\\Phi}{\\\\mathrm dt} which can be expressed in a simpler way : e = - N\\\\times S\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm dB}{\\\\mathrm dt} by assuming that the induced magnetic field B is homogeneous over a section S (the Magnetic flux will be expressed \\\\Phi = B\\\\times S ). Figure 1: Induction sensor made up of a winding (orange) surrounding a ferromagnetic core (grey) The induced voltage (e) may be increased several ways: * increase the surface (S), * increase the turn number (N), * use a ferromagnetic core.  Search coil using a ferromagnetic core  When a coil is wound around a ferromagnetic core, that increases the sensitivity of the sensor thanks to the apparent permeability of the ferromagnetic core. = Apparent permeability = The magnetic amplification, known as apparent permeability \\\\mu_{app}, is the result of the magnetization of the ferromagnetic core response to an external magnetic field. The magnetization is reduced by the demagnetizing field. : \\\\mu_{app} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm \\\\mu_r}{\\\\mathrm 1+N_z\\\\times(\\\\mu_r-1)} where \\\\mu_r is the relative permeability, N_z is the demagnetizing coefficient in the z direction. The induced voltage will be written : e = - NS\\\\mu_{app}\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm dB}{\\\\mathrm dt} The demagnetizing coefficient can easily be computed in the case of simple shapes (spheres and ellipsoids).  Applications  * Eye tracker A search coil is used to measure eye movement using coils that are embedded into a tightly-fitting contact lens or a rubber ring that adheres to the eye. In animal studies, the search coil may be surgically implanted into the sclera of the eye. Alternating magnetic fields are generated by magnets positioned around the eye. Through electromagnetic induction, electric currents are generated in the search coils. The polarity and amplitude of the current generated varies with the direction and angular displacement of the eye. By measuring these values, the position of the eye can be determined. Search coils can be applied to one or both eyes. In order to detect eye orientation in more than one dimension (e.g. up/down vs. left/right), multiple magnets oriented orthogonally to each other may be used. Each magnet generates a field using a different frequency, allowing the readings from the search coil to be analyzed by computer to determine displacement in multiple dimensions. Additionally, a second search coil can be added to measure torsional rotation. * Education A more crude search coil also called exploring coil is also used in laboratory experiments in schools to measure the magnetic field in a certain region of space. In this case the search coil consists of a simple wire coil or solenoid connected to a sensitive ammeter or galvanometer. The coil is placed in the magnetic field to be measured and quickly withdrawn to a region of space with a negligible magnetic field. As the search coil moves the magnetic flux linked with the coil changes. This induces a current in the coil which can be registered on the galvanometer. Since induced current is directly proportional to rate of change of flux linkage and assuming the coil is removed from the magnetic field very quickly, the maximum current measured by the ammeter is proportional to the magnetic field \\\\ \\\\mathbf{B}. The search coil can be calibrated by repeating this in a known magnetic field. A reference table shows open coil voltage versus magnetic field A/m (or teslas) or short current versus magnetic field. * Non Destructive Testing * Magnetotellurics * Space research Spacecraft with on board search coil magnetometers have been built for many decades to investigate EM waves in space plasma. * Natural electromagnetic waves observations on Earth.

Early life Sykes was born in Wentworth, near Rotherham, Yorkshire, England . As a member of a poor family, he received no formal education, and took on paid work from an early age. In 1851 he was recorded as unmarried and working as a coal-pit trammer. In 1853 Sykes married Myra Wilcock, and over the next ten years they had four children. He was later employed as a puddler. On 10 October 1865, Sykes went poaching with a group of six other men. Evidence suggests that Sykes had often poached in the past, but he had never been caught before. On this night the men were challenged by a group of gamekeepers, and in making their escape Sykes and a number of other men assaulted one of the gamekeepers. The gamekeeper died from his injuries, and a reward was offered for information about the attack. Eventually, the government offered a free pardon to anyone willing to give evidence, whereupon one of the seven men, Robert Woodhouse, gave evidence against the other six. Four of the men, including Sykes, were found guilty of manslaughter, and received life sentences with a minimum of twenty years of penal servitude. Sykes served the first nine months of his sentence in solitary confinement at Wakefield prison. He was then transferred to Portsmouth prison, and on 2 April 1867 boarded the Norwood for transportation to Western Australia. His brief diary of the voyage is extant. Western Australia The Norwood arrived at Fremantle, Western Australia on 13 July. On arrival Sykes was assigned a number, 9589, and recorded as \\"about five feet six and three-quarter inches in height, with light brown hair, grey eyes, an oval visage of light complexion, and in appearance healthy\\"; shortly afterwards he was sent to Bunbury to work on the roads. He worked in the district for seven years. He is then believed to have been sent to Newcastle (now Toodyay) around October 1875. By 1877 he had gained his ticket of leave, and was registered to work in the Toodyay district. He worked for a short time as a servant to the medical officer William Mayhew before working at various labouring jobs in the district, including grubbing, woodcutting, fencing, and well sinking. He apparently worked well until November 1879, but over the following three years his record indicates that he was often fined for drunkenness. A bout of severe illness in 1883 saw him in the Newcastle depot hospital for a month. He never fully recovered his health. In 1885 he received his conditional release. Sykes spent the last few years of his life working on the railway from Clackline to Newcastle. Late in December 1890, he was found lying ill in his hut on the Clackline railway; he was removed to Newcastle Hospital, where he was diagnosed as suffering from a hepatitic ulcer and chronic hepatitis. He died five days later on 4 January 1891 and was buried in a mass grave in the Toodyay cemetery. His few belongings, including an old gun and his dog, were sold to recoup the ¬£2/15/- that it cost the government to provide the coffin. Legacy Sykes may have remained a historically insignificant character, if not for the discovery in 1931 of a collection of letters written to him by his wife. The letters were found in a crevice during the demolition of old police buildings at Toodyay, and handed in to the Royal Western Australian Historical Society, which lodged them with the State Archives of Western Australia. Many years later, the social historian Alexandra Hasluck rediscovered the letters and researched Sykes. The results of her research were published as her 1959 book Unwilling Emigrants.

The park is located where the southernmost tip of the Sierra Nevada converges with the El Paso Mountains. Each tributary canyon is unique, with vivid colors. After wet winters, the park's floral displays are notable. Wildlife includes roadrunners, hawks, lizards, mice and squirrels. Red Rock Canyon is an approximately unit within the Mojave Sector of the Tehachapi District of the California State Park System, located along State Highway 14 in Kern County, about east of Bakersfield and north of Mojave. Red Rock Canyon provides magnificent views of the pristine desert landscape, includes two natural preserves, and offers, among other recreation activities, camping, sightseeing, equestrian activities, hiking, and opportunities for reflection and solitude. Location The park is located on State Route 14, which connects U.S. Route 395 with the communities of Southern California, where 14 is known as the Antelope Valley Freeway. The park is northeast of Mojave on SR 14. SR 14 goes through the center of the park, in the canyon itself. No motorist/tourist facilities are available. It is not far from Cantil, California. Camping, picnic, and restroom facilities are available in several sites immediately off of California Route 14. History The area was once home to the Kawaiisu people. Some petroglyphs and pictographs are found in the El Paso Mountains and represent ritual sites from ancestors of the Coso people were early indigenous inhabitants of this locale. They created extensive carvings in rock within the El Paso and neighboring mountains of Red Rock Canyon.Alan P. Garfinkel. 2004 and conducted considerable trade with other tribes as far as the Chumash on the Pacific coast.C.Michael Hogan. 2008 The colorful rock formations in the park served as landmarks during the early 1870s for 20-mule team freight wagons that stopped for water. The park protects significant paleontology sites and the remains of 1890s-era mining operations. 1933 and 1999 Between these two photographs, 66 years have elapsed. In the 1933 picture Red Rock Canyon was on U.S. Route 6, a well-traveled route from Bishop to Los Angeles along the east side of the Sierra Nevada. The scenery at this point in the road eventually led to the creation of Red Rock Canyon State Park in 1968. A dirt road crosses the center of the view. In the 1999 photo, a total of 17 species are now present in the foreground. No Yuccas, Joshua trees or other plants have persisted over the 66 years between the dates of the photographs. In most of the repeat photography, few Yuccas appear to live longer than about 40 years. Many more plants appear in the 1999 view, partially in response to decreased disturbance as well as increased precipitation in the latter part of the 20th century. For example, the road that previously crossed the foreground is difficult to detect. The foreground of this view is geomorphically active, and small rills and gullies cross parts of the foreground. Young geomorphic surfaces, such as that portrayed in this 1999 view, support young plant assemblages that recover relatively quickly following cessation of disturbance. Filming location Providing several unique, dramatic areas, and close to Los Angeles, since the 1930s Hollywood has frequently filmed at Red Rock Canyon, including motion pictures, television series, advertisements, and music videos. Among the many westerns filmed there were The Big Country and The Outlaw, and such diverse movies as Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970), Buck Rogers (serial), Capricorn One,The Mummy, Zorro Rides Again, Jurassic Park, I'll Be Home for Christmas, Missile to the Moon, The Car, Westworld, Savages, and TV series Airwolf , Galactica 1980, Lost in Space and The Twilight Zone . 40 Guns to Apache Pass, the last film of Audie Murphy, was shot there in 1966. The 2005 music video Cater 2 U by Destiny's Child was filmed at Red Rock Canyon. The 2006 video for British rock band Muse song \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" was shot in the park as well.  Astronomy  Red Rock Canyon is one of the darkest skies within a two hour driving distance of Los Angeles. The dry climate, frequently cloudless skies, and relatively low light pollution enhance nighttime viewing conditions. The park is a Bortle class 2-3 site, ranging from an \\"average dark sky\\" in northern regions to a sky typical of a rural area in southern regions. On a clear night with no moon, visitors with good eyesight and dark adapted vision may see both the Andromeda and Triangulum galaxies with the unaided eye, and the central Milky Way shows complex structure from this site. While the southern sky suffers from light pollution from nearby towns, dark sky conditions in the park are nonetheless exceptional relative to nearby urban areas.

(Zhu Quanzhong had initiated the siege after the powerful eunuchs, led by Han Quanhui, an ally of Li Maozhen's, forcibly seized then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong and took him from the imperial capital Chang'an to Fengxiang after they became apprehensive that Emperor Zhaozong and the chancellor Cui Yin were about to slaughter the eunuchs. Cui, an ally of Zhu Quanzhong's, then summoned Zhu Quanzhong to attack Fengxiang.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. As of fall 902, Zhu Quanzhong had had Fengxiang under siege for about a year, but was unable to capture it, with his siege efforts hampered by rain and his soldiers becoming ill. He thus considered withdrawing to Huguo Circuit (Ë≠∑Âúã, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), which he also possessed. Zhu Jichang and fellow officer Liu Zhijun, however, opposed, pointing out that Li Maozhen was in desperate straits. Zhu Quanzhong, however, was concerned about Li Maozhen's strategy of refusing to engage the Xuanwu troops and putting up a strong defense at Fengxiang. At Zhu Jichang's suggestion, Zhu Quanzhong decided to try trickery ‚Äî and asked for a volunteer soldier to try to trick Li Maozhen into engaging the Xuanwu army. One Ma Jing () volunteered, and pretended to surrender to the Fengxiang army. Ma then informed Li Maozhen that Zhu Quanzhong had already left, leaving only about 10,000 ill soldiers to pretend to be still putting up a siege, and that even they would depart that night. He suggested that Li Maozhen attack the Xuanwu camp. Li Maozhen agreed and attacked ‚Äî and his army immediately fell into a trap set by the Xuanwu army, suffering large losses. From this point on, Li Maozhen, while not surrendering immediately, began to negotiate with Zhu Quanzhong for peace, promising to give the emperor to him (which occurred eventually in spring 903). For Zhu Jichang's contributions to this victory, Zhu Quanzhong made him the military prefect (ÂúòÁ∑¥‰Ωø, Tuanlianshi) of Song Prefecture (ÂÆãÂ∑û, in modern Shangqiu, Henan). Zhu Jichang subsequently participated in the Xuanwu army's campaign against Wang Shifan the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong) and was made the defender (Èò≤Á¶¶‰Ωø, Fangyushi) of Ying Prefecture (ÊΩÅÂ∑û, in modern Fuyang, Anhui). His surname was changed back to Gao. In 905, Zhu Quanzhong had conquered Zhongyi (Âø†Áæ©, headquartered in modern Xiangyang, Hubei) and Jingnan (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei) Circuits, then ruled by brothers Zhao Kuangning and Zhao Kuangming, respectively. Zhu initially made his officer He Gui the acting military governor of Jingnan. However, later in the year, when Lei Yangong the military governor of Wuzhen Circuit (Ê≠¶Ë≤û, headquartered in modern Changde, Hunan) repeatedly made incursions into Jingnan territory and He Gui reacted by merely defending Jingnan's capital Jiangling Municipality without engaging Lei, Zhu believed He to be fearful. He sent Gao to replace He Gui, while sending the officer Ni Kefu () to Jingnan as well to help defend against Lei. Lei then withdrew.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265.  During Later Liang  = During Emperor Taizu's reign = In 907, Zhu Quanzhong had Emperor Zhaozong's son and successor Emperor Ai yield the throne to him, ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu. He commissioned Gao Jichang as the full military governor of Jingnan. By this point, Jingnan, which formerly consisted of eight prefectures (counting Jiangling Municipality as a prefecture), had suffered much through warfare, and most of its prefectures had been taken by warlords ruling other circuits. Even Jiangling itself had its walls and buildings in disrepair, and its population greatly reduced. When Gao arrived at Jiangling, he comforted the people and encouraged them to return, and it was said that the people's lives began to return to normal.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. In fall 907, Lei Yangong, with aid from Ma Yin the Prince of Chu (even though that Ma was formally a Later Liang vassal), attacked Jiangling. Gao stationed troops at Gong'an (ÂÖ¨ÂÆâ, in modern Jingzhou) to cut off Lei's food supply route, and then defeated him. He withdrew, as did Chu troops. Later, Lei attacked Cenyang (Ê∂îÈôΩ, also in modern Jingzhou) and Gong'an, but could not capture them. After these attacks by Lei, Emperor Taizu resolved to destroy him, as he was then often pillaging the nearby circuits, and also was a vassal to one of Later Liang's rival states, Hongnong. Emperor Taizu therefore ordered that his titles be stripped, and ordered Gao and Ma to attack him. In winter 907, Gao sent Ni Kefu to rendezvous with the Chu general Qin Yanhui () to attack Wuzhen's capital Lang Prefecture (). Lei sought aid from Hongnong, and Yang Wo the Prince of Hongnong sent his generals Ling Ye () and Li Rao () to try to aid him. Ling and Li, however, were intercepted by the Chu general Xu Dexun, who captured them; Ma subsequently executed them. Subsequently, Yang, apparently again trying to save Lei, sent troops to attack Later Liang's Zhongyi and Jingnan Circuits, but both attacks were repelled, with Gao defeating the Hongnong general Li Hou (). By summer 908, Lang Prefecture fell to Qin, and Lei fled to Hongnong. Wuzhen was absorbed into Chu territory. Apparently in response, Gao stationed troops at Hankou to cut off the tributary route between Chu and Later Liang's capital Luoyang. Ma subsequently sent Xu to attack the Jingnan troops stationed there, but before Xu could arrive, Gao sued for peace.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. Later that year, Emperor Taizu bestowed the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi on Gao. Also in 908, one Liang Zhen, who had passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi () class in the late Tang years, was returning from Luoyang to his home region, then ruled by Former Shu. When he went through Jiangling, Gao met him and was impressed by him, and so wanted to keep him at Jingnan to be secretary. Because of Gao's low birth, Liang considered it a humiliation to serve on Gao's staff, but did not dare to leave without Gao's permission, as he feared that Gao would kill him if he did. He therefore stated to Gao: Gao agreed. For the rest of Liang's life, he referred himself as \\"former Jinshi\\" and did not accept title positions offered to him by Gao (and later, by Gao's son Gao Conghui). Gao valued Liang's advice greatly and effectively made Liang his chief strategist. In 909, the soldiers at Zhongyi mutinied and killed the acting military governor Wang Ban (), supporting one of their own, Li Hong (), to be acting military governor. Li Hong submitted to and sought aid from Former Shu. He also subsequently attacked Jingnan, but Gao sent Ni to repel him. Emperor Taizu subsequently sent the officer Chen Hui () to rendezvous with Jingnan troops to attack Li Hong. They soon captured Zhongyi's capital Xiang Prefecture (), taking Li Hong captive and sending him to Luoyang to be executed. In 910, Ma sent an army to attack Jingnan, but Gao defeated it and repelled it. By 912, it was said that Gao was beginning to contemplate making Jingnan his own personal possession, and therefore, after receiving approval to do so, added a second layer to Jiangling's city walls to add to its defensive capabilities.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. = After Emperor Taizu's reign = In summer 912, Emperor Taizu was assassinated by his son Zhu Yougui the Prince of Ying, who, after blaming the assassination on his adoptive brother Zhu Youwen the Prince of Kang and killing Zhu Youwen, took the throne. In late 912, Chen Zhang (), a general of Wu ‚Äî i.e., formerly Hongnong but now known as Wu ‚Äî attacked Chu's Yue Prefecture (Â≤≥Â∑û, in modern Yueyang, Hunan) and captured it. Chen then attacked Jingnan, but could not capture it and so withdrew. Jingnan and Chu troops then converged at the mouth of where Han River flowed into the Yangtze River, trying to intercept him, but he went past them during the night and escaped their attempt to stop him. Around the same time, Gao Jixing, announcing that he was joining the campaign of Later Liang forces then fighting against Later Liang's archenemy Jin to the north, took his army and advanced north, but instead was attacking Xiang Prefecture (), the capital of Zhongyi ‚Äî which by this time had reverted to its older name of Shannan East Circuit. Kong Qing () the military governor of Shannan East repelled him. It was said that after this battle, Gao stopped submitting tributes to the Later Liang imperial government. In 913, Zhu Yougui's younger brother Zhu Youzhen the Prince of Jun overthrew Zhu Yougui and took the throne himself (and then changed his name to Zhu Zhen). He tried to placate Gao by creating Gao the Prince of Bohai. However, Gao still began to build a fleet that eventually grew to 500 ships, and further enhanced his defenses and the soldiers' armors and weapons. Further, he began to enter into diplomatic communications with Former Shu and Wu, with the Later Liang imperial government unable to stop him. In 914, Gao launched his fleet and headed west on the Yangtze, trying to capture four prefectures that were previously part of Jingnan but which had become Former Shu territory ‚Äî Kui (), Wan (), Zhong (), and Fu (Ê∂™Â∑û, all in modern Chongqing). However, when he attacked Kui first, he was defeated by the Former Shu prefect of Kui, Wang Chengxian (), and withdrew with heavy losses. In light of Gao's attack, there was suggestions made to the Former Shu emperor Wang Jian that Former Shu destroy a dam on the Three Gorges to let the water destroy Jiangling, but Wang, listening to the advice of his official Mao Wenxi that doing so would kill innocent civilians, did not do so.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. In 917, Gao and Kong repaired their relationship, and he resumed submitting tributes to the Later Liang imperial government. In 919, a Chu army attacked Jingnan. Gao sought aid from Wu. Wu sent the general Liu Xin () to head toward the Chu capital Tan Prefecture (in modern Changsha, Hunan) while the general Li Jian () attacked Fu Prefecture (Âæ©Â∑û, in modern Tianmen, Hubei). With Liu heading toward Tan Prefecture, the Chu army attacking Jingnan withdrew, but Li Jian still was able to capture Fu Prefecture.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. In 921, Gao ordered Ni, whose son Ni Zhijin () had married a daughter of Gao's by this point, to oversee a project to repair Jiangling's outer walls. When Gao himself went to review the project, he blamed Ni Kefu for the project's slow pace and publicly caned him. However, he stated to his daughter, \\"Go back to your home and tell your father-in-law: all I wanted to do was to display my authority in front of the people.\\" He also secretly gave her a large amount of platinum for her to give to Ni Kefu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271.  During Later Tang  = During Emperor Zhuangzong's reign = In 923, Li Cunxu the Prince of Jin declared himself emperor of a new Later Tang (as Emperor Zhuangzong). Shortly after, he made a surprise attack on the Later Liang capital Daliang, catching the city defenseless. Zhu Zhen committed suicide, ending Later Liang. The Later Liang- commissioned military governors, including Gao Jichang subsequently all submitted petitions to him pledging loyalty. Gao further changed his name to Gao Jixing to observe naming taboo (as Emperor Zhuangzong's grandfather was Li Guochang). To show his faithfulness to the new Later Tang emperor, he further wanted to go to Daliang to pay homage to the new emperor. Liang Zhen tried to stop him, stating:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. When Gao arrived at Daliang, Emperor Zhuangzong bestowed the greater honorary chancellor title of acting Zhongshu Ling () on him. On one occasion, the emperor asked him, \\"We would like to attack Wu and Shu. Which one should be first?\\" Gao, not actually wanting Emperor Zhuangzong to succeed and believing that Former Shu would be more difficult to conquer due to the geographical barriers, responded, \\"Wu has infertile lands and poor people; conquering it would do no good. Shu should be attacked first. Its lands are rich; its ruler [(Wang Jian's son and successor Wang Zongyan) is frivolous; and its people are discontented. You will surely be able to conquer it if you attack it. After conquering it, go down the river [(i.e., the Yangtze)], and it would be easy to conquer Wu.\\" Emperor Zhuangzong was pleased with his suggestion. Shortly after, Emperor Zhuangzong set his capital at Luoyang, and Gao followed him there. Gao soon became disenchanted that Emperor Zhuangzong's favorite actors and eunuchs were demanding gifts from him, and wanted to return to Jingnan. Emperor Zhuangzong, however, was considering detaining Gao at Luoyang. The emperor's chief of staff Guo Chongtao urged against it, pointing out that the other military governors, at most, had only sent sons, brothers, or staff members to pay homage, and that only Gao had come himself; Guo believed that detaining Gao would send the wrong message. Emperor Zhuangzong therefore allowed him to leave. When Gao reached Xu Prefecture (Ë®±Â∑û, in modern Xuchang, Henan), he commented, \\"This trip contained two mistake: The first mistake was that I came; the second mistake was that he let me leave.\\" When he went through Xiang Prefecture, Kong Qing held a feast for him, but at night, Gao cut open the lock on the city gate and escaped. When he reached Jiangling, he held Liang Zhen's hands and said, \\"I did not accept your suggestion, and I was almost caught in a tiger's mouth.\\" He further spoke with his staff members and criticized Emperor Zhuangzong: Gao then further built up the city's defenses and food storage, and he welcomed old Later Liang soldiers into his army, preparing for an eventual defensive war. In 924, Emperor Zhuangzong bestowed the even greater honorary chancellor title of Shangshu Ling () on Gao and created him the Prince of Nanping. In fall 925, Emperor Zhuangzong launched a major attack on Former Shu, intending to destroy it. He made his son Li Jiji the Prince of Wei the titular commander of the operations, with Guo as Li Jiji's deputy and the one in actual charge of the military operations. As part of the division of responsibilities among Later Tang vassals, Emperor Zhuangzong gave Gao the title of commander of southeastern operations and ordered him to attack and take Kui, Zhong, and Wan Prefectures to add to his own territory. Gao left his son Gao Conghui in charge of Jiangling and headed west on the Yangtze. He thereafter was hampered by a large iron chain that the Former Shu general Zhang Wu () set up to defend the Three Gorges. He tried to send soldiers to destroy the chain, but Zhang attacked and defeated him, forcing him to retreat back to Jiangling. However, soon thereafter, Zhang heard news that Li Jiji and Guo had crushed the main Former Shu resistance force, and so send messengers to submit to Li Jiji. When, soon thereafter, Gao heard news that Wang Yan surrendered to Li Jiji, he, who was eating at that time, dropped his chopsticks, stating, \\"This is the fault of this old man.\\" Liang Zhen instead stated, \\"You need not worry. The ruler of Tang, after receiving Shu lands, would surely become even more arrogant and soon be destroyed. How do you know that this would not be to our benefit?\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274. Subsequently, after Emperor Zhuangzong, believing in false rumors of their planning to rebel against him, had Guo and another major general, Zhu Youqian, killed, many rebellions started against him. By summer 926, even the army at Luoyang mutinied, and he was killed in the mutiny. When Gao received this news, he became even more respectful of Liang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. = During Emperor Mingzong's reign = In the aftermaths of Emperor Zhuangzong's death, Emperor Zhuangzong's adoptive brother Li Siyuan claimed imperial title (as Emperor Mingzong). Meanwhile, Gao Jixing prepared his fleet and wanted to attack Chu. His official Sun Guangxian, whom Liang Zhen had recommended to him to be his scribe, pointed out that Jingnan had barely recovered from the wars, and if it were engaged in a war with Chu, other states might take advantage and attack Jingnan. Gao agreed and stopped his plans to attack Chu. Meanwhile, he requested that Jingnan be given control of Kui, Zhong, and Wan Prefectures; Emperor Mingzong agreed. However, soon thereafter Gao began a series of actions that provoked Emperor Mingzong's administration. He had requested, after Emperor Mingzong gave him Kui, Zhong, and Wan Prefectures, that the imperial government not commission prefects for those prefectures, but allow him to commission his own family members; Emperor Mingzong refused. Soon thereafter, when Pan Kang (a former Former Shu official) left his post as prefect of Kui, Gao sent an army to Kui, killed the soldiers already stationed there, and took direct control, and when Emperor Mingzong subsequently commissioned the officer Xifang Ye () to be the prefect, Gao refused to allow Xifang to take office. He also launched a surprise attack on Fu Prefecture, but was unable to capture it. Further, when Han Gong (), an officer that Li Jiji (who committed suicide after his own soldiers refused to follow his orders after Emperor Zhuangzong's death) had sent to escort Former Shu treasures down the Yangtze to Luoyang, went through the Three Gorges, Gao sent an army to surprise and kill Han, and he took over the treasures. When Emperor MIngzong sent an emissary to question Gao about what happened to Han, Gao responded: \\"Han Gong and the others took ships down the Gorges and had to go thousands of li. If you want to know why their ships overturned and they drowned, you should question the river god.\\" In anger, Emperor Mingzong stripped Gao of his titles and commissioned Liu Xun () the military governor of Shannan East to attack Gao from the north, with Xia Luqi () the military governor of Zhongwu Circuit (Âø†Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Xuchang) as Liu's deputy; Dong Zhang the military governor of Dongchuan Circuit (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan) to attack him from the west, with Xifang as Dong's deputy; and Ma Yin to attack from the south. Liu quickly put Jiangling under siege, but as Jiangling was humid, and it happened to be rainy season, the siege was hampered, with many of Liu's soldiers and Liu himself becoming ill. Emperor Mingzong sent Kong Xun, who had become his chief of staff, to Jiangling to oversee the siege. Kong, who was also unable to capture Jiangling, sent emissaries into the city to try to persuade Gao to submit. Gao not only refused to do so, but was rude to Kong's emissaries. Meanwhile, despite Emperor Mingzong's sending much gifts to Ma, Ma found excuses not to attack Jiangling. With the siege unsuccessful, Emperor Mingzong ordered Liu to withdraw. However, Xifang was able to defeat Jingnan forces stationed at Kui, Zhong, and Wan, and recapture those three prefectures for the Later Tang imperial government. Emperor Mingzong created a Ningjiang Circuit (), with its headquarters at Kui, and made Xifang its military governor. Despite Xifang's victory, Emperor Mingzong blamed the approval of Gao's petition to take the three prefectures on the former chancellors Doulu Ge and Wei Shuo, and ordered them to commit suicide. Around the same time, Gao intercepted and captured Ma's tributary emissary to Emperor Mingzong, Shi Guangxian (), as well as the awards that Emperor Mingzong was sending Ma via Shi. He thereafter submitted a petition requesting to be a Wu vassal. However, the Wu regent Xu Wen believed that it would be ill-advised for Wu to accept Gao as a vassal, pointing out that Jiangling was much closer to the Later Tang capital Luoyang than to Wu's capital Guangling (Âª£Èôµ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and therefore it would be difficult Wu to aid Jingnan if Later Tang attacked again; he therefore accepted Gao's tributes but refused to accept him as a vassal. In spring 928, Xifang captured Jingnan's Gui Prefecture (Ê≠∏Â∑û, in modern Yichang, Hubei), but soon Jingnan forces recaptured it. Also in spring 928, Ma sent Yuan Quan (), Wang Huan (), and his son Ma Xizhan () to attack Jingnan. Gao himself engaged the Chu forces, but Ma Xizhan was able to lay a trap for him at Liulang Ford (ÂäâÈÉéË¢±, in modern Jingzhou) and defeat him. The Chu forces then approached Jiangling. In fear, Gao sued for peace and returned Shi to Chu. (When Ma Yin subsequently questioned Wang why the Chu army did not go ahead and try to capture Jiangling, Wang pointed out that Jingnan served as a buffer zone between Chu and Later Tang, Wu, and the Shu region. Ma understood Wang's point and did not question him further.) In summer 928, the Wu generals Miao Lin () and Wang Yanzhang () were attacking Chu's Yue Prefecture, and they were set to rendezvous with Jingnan forces. Xu Dexun defeated and captured them, however, and it is not clear whether Jingnan forces actually participated in the battle. Soon thereafter, Gao again requested to be a Wu vassal. With Xu Wen's having died and his adoptive son Xu Zhigao now regent, Wu agreed to accept Gao as a vassal and created him the Prince of Qin. Emperor Mingzong thereafter ordered Ma Yin to attack Gao. Ma sent Xu and his son Ma Xifan to advance to Shatou (Ê≤ôÈ†≠, in modern Jingzhou). When the armies engaged, Gao's nephew Gao Congsi () challenged Ma Xifan to a one-on-one combat, but the Chu officer Liao Kuangqi () instead took the challenge and killed Gao Congsi in the one-on-one combat. Gao Jixing then sued for peace, and Ma Yin agreed, recalling Xu and Ma Xifan. In fall 928, Emperor Mingzong commissioned the general Fang Zhiwen () to attack Jingnan, and he summoned the troops from many circuits to converge at Xiang Prefecture to prepare to attack Jiangling. However, before the Later Tang forces could converge and attack, Gao himself died around the new year 929. The Wu emperor Yang Pu commissioned Gao Conghui as the new military governor of Jingnan. Subsequently, Gao Conghui, who had not been supportive of Gao Jixing's resistance against Later Tang, submitted a petition to Later Tang's Emperor Mingzong, asking to again be a vassal of Later Tang. In spring 929, Emperor Mingzong agreed and ended the campaign against Jingnan. Emperor Mingzong subsequently posthumously created Gao Jixing the Prince of Chu.

It should not be confused with the 17th-century Tron Church, which lies to the south-west on Trongate and was redeveloped in the 1980s as the Tron Theatre. Located right on the busiest shopping street in Scotland (Buchanan Street),Glasgow, 163 Buchanan Street, St George's Tron Parish Church, Canmore the building is a significant presence, and the oldest in the area. It stands as a terminating vista for West George Street. History The church opened in 1808, originally as St. George's Parish Church, with the original congregation originating from the Wynd Church in the Merchant City near to the Trongate. In 1815 Thomas Chalmers, later to be the leader of the evangelical party in the disruption of 1843, became minister of the church. A merger with the Tron St Anne congregation (previously of the Laigh Kirk on Trongate)Old Tron Steeple (Glasgow University Library, Special Collections, Wylie Collection), The Glasgow StoryThe Building, Tron Theatre in 1940 led to the compound St George's Tron name coming into use. A notable minister of the parish was Tom Allan, a key figure in the Scottish evangelical movement of the mid-20th century. Tom Allan died of a heart attack in 1965. His ministry was followed by that of George Baillie Duncan who developed a strong emphasis on Biblical preaching and teaching and who served from 1965 to 1977. Another notable minister, also an evangelical, was Eric Alexander, who served from 1977 to 1997 as was Sinclair Ferguson who served in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 2004 Rev Dr William J. U. Philip became minister of the congregation, following a five-year term as Director of Ministry with the Proclamation Trust. During his ministry he oversaw the establishment of Cornhill Scotland, a training organisation for preachers and teachers of the Bible. =2012 secession= In 2012 Philip and all of the 500 members of the congregation left the Church of Scotland over the ongoing discussions within the Church of whether to permit openly gay clergy, which the congregation saw as the Church of Scotland rejecting the Authority of Scripture.Recent History, The Tron Church There was controversy after messengers-at-arms interrupted the congregational prayer meeting and requested the minister leading the prayer meeting come and meet with them. They then served him with the interim interdict. The following day, messengers-at-arms called at the St George's Tron manse to serve the same writ because there had been a mistake made by the Court in the dating of the court order. This was reported in the national press and on BBC News. The displaced group moved to a nearby building at Bath Street in order to continue as an independent congregation, and later also took on a vacant standalone church in the Sandyford area which had latterly been in use as a base for the Royal Scottish National Orchestra as Henry Wood Hall.The Tron at Kelvingrove, The Tron ChurchFinal curtain as orchestra bows out of historic city church base, Evening Times, 29 May 2012 =Recent history= New interior design The Church of Scotland in June 2012 announced that it would re-build the Church of Scotland congregation based in the Church building where worship continues under a new minister and a new congregation. In March 2013 the Church of Scotland minister, the Rev Alastair Duncan, was inducted at the St George's Tron Church. Under Duncan, the Sunday services were restructured with a cafe church in the middle of the day and a more conventional evening service. In 2015 Iain Campbell took up a temporary post as Artist-in-Residence at St George's. Campbell produced a painting titled \\"the last supper\\" depicting men in difficult personal circumstances dining at a table. This was to commemorate a cafe operated in the church which was a social enterprise project run in conjunction with Glasgow City Mission. In 2017, the Glasgow Street Pastors operated out of St George's Tron. Architecture The building, which was commissioned by the City Fathers was designed by William Stark, was opened in 1808, originally as St. George's Parish Church. =Refurbishment= From 2007-9 the church building was extensively refurbished by CRGP architects and surveyors, at a cost of ¬£3m, the vast majority of it raised by the then congregation. This restored a number of original features which had been concealed by practical alterations over the years as well as revealing and addressing structural weaknesses in the tower which could have been catastrophic if left unaddressed. The new interior is much more open and of contemporary design.

The company places employees at all levels in various sectors including financial services, information technology, and law. Also, its professional services include human resource and management consulting, outsourcing, recruitment, career transition, and vendor management. Kelly Services was founded by William Russell Kelly in 1946 and is headquartered in Troy, Michigan.  History  Founded in 1946 by William Russell Kelly, the company was originally named Russell Kelly Office Service. Services were provided in- house at the Kelly office. However, as customer offices grew and needed more resources, they began to ask for the Kelly employees to perform the work at their own offices. Temporary workers from Russell Kelly Office Service soon became known as ‚ÄòKelly Girls‚Äô. Adelaide Hess Moran, the first Kelly temporary employee to work at a customer‚Äôs office was promptly dubbed the first ‚ÄòKelly Girl‚Äô. The temporary workers, usually female, became known as \\"Kelly girls\\", and the company name was changed to Kelly Girl Service, Inc. in 1957. Eventually \\"Kelly girl\\" became a widely used term for a temporary worker, regardless of company affiliation or gender. By 1966, the company had expanded to include industrial and technical services divisions and was renamed Kelly Services, Inc. In 2015, the company reported 8,100 employees, $5.5 billion in revenue, making it one of the world's largest staffing firms. In 2018, the company reported $5.5 billion in revenue. , the CEO is Peter Quigley.

The mixed use development consists of residential, retail, and entertainment opened in 2018 to replace what was known as the Granite Run Mall, a double- level shopping mall that existed between 1974 and 2015. Two of the original mall tenants, Boscov's and Sears, remained open during the transition. History The property originally opened as the Granite Run Mall in 1974. In 1986, the Gimbels store was converted to Stern's after Allied Stores purchased seven Gimbels locations in the Philadelphia area. In 1989, Stern's closed and was eventually replaced with Boscov's in 1993. In 1998, Simon Property Group and Macerich purchased the mall, with Simon responsible for managing the mall. The Granite Run Mall had a total of 125 stores at its peak. In the 2000s, The Granite Run Mall saw an increase in vacancies and its owners started exploring options for selling the mall. In February 2011, Simon and Macerich were over 30 days delinquent on the mall's $115 million mortgage, leading to the possibility of a sale or forfeiture of the mall. On April 1, 2011, Simon Property Group gave the mall back to its lender and the lender appointed Madison Marquette as the leasing and management agent. Madison Marquette announced plans to improve lighting, the parking lots, and sidewalks as well as to fill vacancies. =Redevelopment and closure= Construction on the Promenade at Granite Run in January 2018 On September 23, 2013, the Granite Run Mall was sold to BET Investments, a real estate development firm owned by Bruce Toll and Michael Markman, at a cost of $24 million. BET Investments intends to convert the mall into a mixed-use development consisting of residential, retail, and entertainment. The initial plans for the redevelopment project would keep the three anchor stores but would demolish the remainder of the mall and replace it with an outdoor shopping and dining area. The plans also included the construction two four-story apartment buildings with a total of 365 units between them. Other features that were planned in the redevelopment included a larger movie theater and standalone restaurants. On August 25, 2014, updated plans were revealed for the redevelopment. The three department stores would remain, with the upper level of JCPenney becoming a movie theater, while the interior of the mall will be demolished and turned into an outdoor shopping and dining area with upscale establishments. One four-story luxury apartment building with 385 units will also be constructed. Work on the redevelopment is expected to begin in 2015 or 2016 with completion expected two years after the project begins. The plans were modified again on October 27, 2014 in which two luxury apartments with a total of 388 units would be constructed, one on the site of the movie theater and the other on the site of a former Chi-Chi's restaurant. The redevelopment will take place in two phases. The first phase will demolish the mall interior and build one of the apartment buildings. The second phase will demolish the current movie theater and construct the other apartment building. In January 2015, it was announced the JCPenney store was closing in April as part of a plan to close 39 stores nationwide. As a result, the mall announced plans to demolish the former JCPenney and replace it with new retail space and a movie theater. The interior of the mall closed on July 1, 2015, with Sears and Boscov's remaining open. On November 9, 2015, the final plans for the mixed- use development were approved by the Middletown Township council, in which the development would be called the Promenade at Granite Run. The demolition of the former mall began in 2016. Construction of the Promenade at Granite Run progressed through 2017, with a formal opening in 2018. In popular culture The Granite Run Mall was originally intended to be the filming location for MallBrats, the sequel to director Kevin Smith's 1995 film Mallrats. However, the plan fell through due to the impending demolition of the mall and Smith's desire to start filming in January 2016; MallBrats was instead planned be filmed at the Exton Square Mall before plans were cancelled in February 2017.

It is a fast-growing species that can live in a wide range of climatic conditions, and forms dense forests. It is cultivated for its timber, and as an ornamental subject. Description It can become a large tree, up to high and in diameter. One tree, felled by a storm in 1954, reportedly measured in diameter at the height of a man's chest and a total volume, including the branches, of 87 m¬≥. The coihue usually has elegant branches which are flattened horizontally. The leaves are evergreen, small (25‚Äì40 mm long and 10‚Äì16 mm wide), thick, coriaceous (leathery) and lustrous, dark green, with toothed borders and an acute apex; they have a very small, rounded and rhomb-shaped petiole. The tree is hermaphroditic; male and female flowers are grouped in the same tree, and pollen is spread by wind action. The flowers, measuring less than 5 mm, are insignificant. The fruit is a triangular nut measuring about 4‚Äì7 mm. Etymology The name of the tree is often spelled coig√ºe (reflecting the common Spanish pronunciation with an epenthetic g). Other related trees named coihue are the Coihue de Magallanes (Nothofagus betuloides), and the Coihue de Chilo√© (Nothofagus nitida). The Latin specific epithet dombeyi honours the French botanist Joseph Dombey (1742-1794). Distribution and habitat Nothofagus dombeyi is found from 35 to 45¬∞ South latitude between above mean sea level. It forms dense forests such as those found in the Los Alerces and Nahuel Huapi national parks. It thrives in low hills with gentle slopes, being very demanding of water and soil; the largest forests are found on south-facing slopes, and the healthier specimens tend to grow on the banks of rivers and lakes. It sometimes forms mixed forests with Araucaria araucana (monkey-puzzle) trees, for example in the Villarrica National Park in Chile. Uses Coihue timber is considered excellent. In Argentina its exploitation is limited by the presence of the best forests within national parks. The wood is bright grayish white; the heartwood is a pale pink-white, which darkens after cut. Its texture is very fine and makes it easy to work with. It has a beautiful engraving, is semi- heavy, hard, durable and decay resistant. It is used in furniture, barrels, floors and building. N. dombeyi has been introduced as an ornamental tree for parks and large gardens in the British IslesTWFS List of Accepted Plants of the British Isles 2007 where it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. It has also been introduced to the North Pacific Coast of the United States. It requires an acid pH soil which is fertile and reliably moist.

This spawned two rock groups, Amon D√º√ºl (sometimes referred to as Amon D√º√ºl I) and the more famous Amon D√º√ºl II. After both groups disbanded in the 1970s, some of the original members reunited in the 1980s under the name Amon D√º√ºl again, though this incarnation is commonly referred to as Amon D√º√ºl (UK) to avoid confusion with the original one.  Origins  Amon D√º√ºl began in 1967 as a radical political art commune of Munich-based artists calling themselves, in part, after the Egyptian Sun God Amon. The word D√º√ºl originally had no intended meaning. Led by Ulrich Leopold, Amon D√º√ºl included Ulrich's brother Peter Leopold (15 August 1945 - 8 November 2006), together with Austrian Rainer Bauer and Chris Karrer on guitars. Karrer has since claimed that, \\"the only original thing from that period which hasn't been released yet is a 1967 recording of the basic Amon D√º√ºl band.\\" Later, the commune would add Bauer's sister Ella, Helge and Angelika Filanda, Uschi Obermeier, Wolfgang Krischke, Falk Rogner and Renate Knaup.Communing With Chaos by Edwin Pouncey - 'The Wire' #144 (February 1996) The commune attained underground popularity for its free-form musical improvisations, performed around the happenings and demonstrations of the youth movement at the time. The commune had a liberal attitude to artistic freedom, valuing enthusiasm and attitude over artistic ability, and as a result, band membership was fluid; anyone who was part of the commune could be part of the group. They issued a declaration: \\"We are eleven adults and two children which are gathered to make all kinds of expressions, also musical.\\" A faction within the commune was more ambitious, conventional and musically structured than the commune society overall. This led to a split within the collective, and in September 1968 they performed at the International Essen Song Days--Germany's first underground festival--as two groups, \\"Amon D√º√ºl\\" and \\"Amon D√º√ºl II\\", at the suggestion of drummer Peter Leopold. Amon D√º√ºl engaged in exuberant open-ended experimentation that at times equalled their psychedelic rock equivalents in countries such as the USA or Brazil (e.g. Os Mutantes), with a focus on political activities. The members were close to Kommune 1 in Berlin and boasted, for a time, a prominent member in the model and activist Uschi Obermaier. Amon D√º√ºl signed a contract with the firm \\"Metronome Records\\", and continued for seven years with varying degrees of success and in various guises. They wound down in 1973 after releasing four official albums (and a posthumous fifth), though all except one were recorded at the 1968 sessions for their debut. Apparently, the man responsible was producer Peter Meisel, who released the albums without the band's approval in an attempt to capitalise on the success of Amon D√º√ºl II. The LPs are these days regarded as unique, if unessential, records in the history of German rock.

Band members  Four of the band's five album releases consist of jamming sessions recorded in late 1968 or early 1969. The musicians credited on these sessions are: *Rainer Bauer - guitar, vocals *Ulrich (Uli) Leopold - bass *Helge Filanda - congas, vocals, anvil, percussion *Wolfgang Krischke - percussion, piano *Eleonora Romana (Ella) Bauer - shaker, vocals, percussion *Angelika Filanda - percussion, vocals *Peter Leopold - drums *Uschi Obermaier - maracas, percussion Peter Leopold joined Amon D√º√ºl II in time for their 1969 debut album; Wolfgang Krischke died around 1969, freezing to death while under the influence of LSD;Amon Duul - 'Mojo Magazine' #41 (April 1997) and Uschi Obermaier moved on to Munich's \\"Highfisch-Kommune\\" (scene of Peter Green's notorious LSD experience) and Berlin's \\"Kommune 1\\". Guitarist Klaus Esser then joined the band line-up in time for the 'Eternal Flow' / 'Paramechanical World' single recorded in June 1970: *Ulrich Leopold - bass, vocals, guitar, trumpet, drums *Rainer Bauer - guitar, vocals, bass *Klaus Esser - guitar, vocals, bass, drums *Helge Filanda - drums, vocals, guitar *Angelika Filanda - flute, vocals *Ella Bauer - harp, vocals Rainer Bauer and Ulrich Leopold were guest musicians on one track on the Amon D√º√ºl II album Yeti released 1970, which also featured a photo of the deceased Wolfgang Krischke dressed as 'Der Schnitter' (The Harvester) or 'Der Sensenmann' (The Grim Reaper)Gross, Jason (August 2008) \\"Amon D√º√ºl II: John Weinzierl interview\\" Perfect Sound Forever Retrieved 2010-10-23 on the album cover. On the band's final recording, Paradiesw√§rts D√º√ºl (recorded in November and December 1970), the band were: *Ella Bauer - harp, vocals, bongos *Lemur (Klaus Esser) - drums, vocals, rhythm and fuzz guitars *Ulrich Leopold - bass, vocals, piano, guitar *Dadam (Rainer Bauer) - guitar, vocals, lyrics, bass *Helge Filanda - drums *Noam (Angelika Filanda) - African drums with guests: *Hansi Fischer (from Xhol) - flute, bongos *John Weinzierl (from Amon D√º√ºl II) - guitar *Chris 'Shrat' Thiele (from Amon D√º√ºl II) - bongos Amon D√º√ºl II and Amon D√º√ºl UK Amon D√º√ºl II were formed by the more professionally and technically inclined members of the original collective, with core members Chris Karrer, Falk Rogner, Renate Knaup-Kroetenschwanz, John Weinzierl, and Peter Leopold. They signed to the United Artists label and released a string of highly regarded albums with strong psychedelic and progressive flourishes. After 1975, the band changed labels and moved towards more accessible music, before finally disbanding in the late 1970s. After a spell with Hawkwind, Amon D√º√ºl II's original bassist Dave Anderson formed a short-lived band called Amon Din with drummer John Lingwood, ex-Hawkwind guitarist Huw Lloyd-Langton and John Butler in 1971-2. At the beginning of the 1980s, Amon D√º√ºl II's John Weinzierl, with Dave Anderson and various others, began releasing albums as Amon D√º√ºl, though this band is commonly called Amon D√º√ºl UK to differentiate it from the original one. Between 1982 and 1989, they released five albums. When the 1990s brought new exposure and audiences to the original krautrock groups, Chris, Renate, Falk and John reunited and continue to perform as Amon D√º√ºl II sporadically.  Legacy  Amon D√º√ºl and Amon D√º√ºl II influenced such bands in late 70's like Hungarian psychedelic hardcore, 'shaman punk' band Galloping Coroners.

Album information Although the album's insert lists five members, Annihilator was a three-piece (Randy Rampage, Jeff Waters and Ray Hartmann) at the time of its recording in 1988. In addition to guitar, Waters provides bass and backing vocals on the album, produced it and wrote all the songs, with the exception of \\"Crystal Ann\\". Although Anthony Brian Greenham and Wayne Darley are noted on the album's insert as playing guitar and bass respectively, this was a mistake and they did not join Annihilator until after Alice in Hell was finished; Darley does, however, provide backing vocals on the album. Waters has explained in interviews the reason Greenham and Darley were listed in the credits was at the behest of Roadrunner. Alice in Hell was the first of six Annihilator albums to feature songwriting contributions from former singer John Bates, who was credited as the (co-)writer of the songs \\"Alison Hell\\", \\"W.T.Y.D.\\", \\"Burns Like a Buzzsaw Blade\\" and \\"Human Insecticide\\". Bates also co-wrote some songs on Never, Neverland (1990), King of the Kill (1994), Refresh the Demon (1996), Remains (1997) and Criteria for a Black Widow (1999). To promote Alice in Hell, Annihilator supported Onslaught internationally on their In Search of Sanity tour, and Testament (along with Wrathchild America) in the United States on their Practice What You Preach tour. After the tour was over, the band began preparations for their next album Never, Neverland. The title track \\"Alison Hell\\" was released as part of a DLC package for Rocksmith on April 16, 2019. Reissues The album was re- released twice: 1998 with three demo tracks as bonus tracks and again on September 9, 2003, in a two-disc compilation set along with Never, Neverland, entitled Two from the Vault. One of the demo tracks, \\"Powerdrain\\", serves as the base of the song \\"Sonic Homicide\\" on Annihilator's 1999 album Criteria for a Black Widow. Reception Alice in Hell has received mostly positive reviews. Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia gave it three stars out of five, and states that \\"Annihilator's brand of technical, thinking man's thrash metal garnered many fans with this fine debut, arguably the best release of the band's career.\\" Alice in Hell was ranked number nine in Loudwire's top ten list of \\"Thrash Albums NOT Released by the Big 4\\".

Her paternal grandfather was Russian and grew up in France.koda Jazz Festival 2010: A sweet finale with Stacey Kent... After graduating from Sarah Lawrence College, she traveled to England to study music at Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, where she met saxophonist Jim Tomlinson, whom she married on August 9, 1991. Career In the 1990s, she began her professional career singing at Caf√© Boh√®me in London's Soho. After two or three years, she began opening for established acts at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London. Her first album, Close Your Eyes, was released in 1997. Novelist Kazuo Ishiguro wrote the liner notes to Kent's 2003 album, In Love Again. Ishiguro met Kent after he chose her recording of \\"They Can't Take That Away from Me\\" as one of his Desert Island Discs in 2002, and Kent asked Tomlinson and Ishiguro to write for her. Ishiguro has said of his lyric writing that \\"with an intimate, confiding, first-person song, the meaning must not be self-sufficient on the page. It has to be oblique, sometimes you have to read between the lines\\" and that this realization has had an \\"enormous influence\\" on his fiction writing. Tomlinson and Ishiguro co-wrote four songs on the album Breakfast on the Morning Tram. The first of their songs, \\"The Ice Hotel\\", won first prize in the International Songwriting Competition in April 2008. Kent recorded several more Tomlinson/Ishiguro songs on Dreamer In Concert, The Changing Lights, and I Know I Dream: The Orchestral Sessions. =Popular success = Stacey Kent onstage in 2016 Kent's album The Boy Next Door achieved Gold album status in France in September 2006.

Dreamer In Concert (2011) was recorded in May, 2011, at La Cigale in Paris. The album includes three songs previously unrecorded by Kent: \\"Waters of March\\" by Antonio Carlos Jobim, \\"Postcard Lovers\\" by Jim Tomlinson with lyrics by Kazuo Ishiguro, and \\"O Comboio\\" by Portuguese poet Ant√≥nio Ladeira. In 2013, Kent released The Changing Lights, a Brazilian-tinged album, covering bossa nova classics such as Jobim's \\"How Insensitive\\" and again collaborating with Tomlinson and Ishiguro. In 2014, she left Warner Bros. and signed with Sony. Sony released Tenderly, an album of standards with Roberto Menescal, one of the founders of bossa nova. She met Menescal in Brazil in 2011 at the 80th birthday celebration of the Christ the Redeemer statue. They discovered they were fans of each others' work and collaborated on an album of standards inspired by Menescal's admiration for the duo of Julie London and Barney Kessel. In 2014, Marcos Valle invited her to tour in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of his career. They recorded the album Ao Vivo and a DVD that was recorded live at the Birdland club in New York City and the Blue Note in Tokyo. In 2017, Kent recorded her next album for Sony, I Know I Dream: The Orchestral Sessions, her first album with an orchestra, comprising 58 musicians with arrangements by Tommy Laurence, with music from the Great American Songbook, French chansons, songs by Edu Lobo, Jobim, Tomlinson, Ishiguro, Ladeira and his songwriting partner Cliff Goldmacher from Nashville.

The Order of Good Cheer was founded at Port-Royal, Nova Scotia and was originally chartered under the Royal auspices of the Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt et de Saint- Just and Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons. The Order's practices were established by the first Chief Steward Marc Lescarbot. On May 11, 2001, the Speaker of the House in Nova Scotia, Canada, the Hon. Murray Scott reaffirmed official recognition of the order in Canada as grant of the province under the custodianship of the Nova Scotia Ministry of Heritage. According to resolution 1111, the minimum condition of membership to the order is that a pledge to visit Nova Scotia must be made. The order is generally presented in recognition of individuals valued by the Province of Nova Scotia or in honour of the Acadian tradition in Canada. One becomes a member of the Order of Good Cheer by receiving an invitation from the Province of Nova Scotia or by a chevalier / member of the order. It was after an impossible winter at Ste. Croix Island where many of the first French settlers in North America died of scurvy that the French fur trading colony relocated across the Baie Fran√ßaise (Bay of Fundy), settling the following year in a location they named Port- Royal. At the time it was believed that \\"land sickness\\" (now known as scurvy) was caused by idleness, so Champlain organized the Order to include not just food, but also entertainment. The first meeting, which took place on November 14, 1606, included a theatrical performance called \\"Le Theatre de Neptune en la Nouvelle-France\\". The play told the story of sailors travelling to the New World, only to encounter Neptune, god of the sea on the way. The Baron de Poutrincourt, Intendant to the King of France in North America, had been on an expedition on the Atlantic coast to the coast of present-day Maine,Faragher, John Mack, A Great and Noble Scheme W.W. Norton and Co., New York (2005) pp. 15-16 and, on the occasion of his return to the fort at Port-Royal, the Order was founded at a glorious reception, the preparations for which reportedly involved all those remaining at Port-Royal. His return on the 14th of November, 1606, is a date to remember in the annals of the New World, as the establishment of the first North American order of chivalry and the birth of the Nouveau Noblesse of New France. The feasting of the Order occurred weekly and continued throughout the winter until the last of March, only to recommence annually in the Fall. The first toast of the Order made by the Baron de Poutrincourt: Quoting Lescarbot, the French historian Fran√ßois-Edme Rameau de Saint-P√®re writes: > Poutrincourt returned from his excursion on the 14th November, 1606; > Lescarbot, who was always full of ideas, and who knew, no doubt, the useful > part to be obtained by exterior demonstrations, foresaw to prepare for his > honor a quasi- triumphal return from his voyage; Nature itself has already > furnished the principle [sic] initiative, and advantage of it had been > taken, everywhere were decorations and garlands of natural green; a > magnificent forest hid the rusticity of wooden buildings and huts; even a > theatre was built where allegoric scenes were represented; there was a > feast, a discharge of musketry, and as much noise as could be made by some > fifty men, joined by a few Indians, whose families served as spectators. In 1606, there were less than 70 men at Port-Royal. Lescarbot states that, in total, about 50 Frenchmen, joined by Indians, participated in the welcoming home of Poutrincourt and the first gathering of the Order. However only fifteen men of birth are recognized as founding the Order. These would have been the only men present at the time of sufficient social standing with whom Champlain and the Baron de Poutrincourt would care to dine. The guests of the Order likely sat at other tables, probably getting equally good dinners as the rest, but without being recognized as official members of the Order. Likely everyone at the settlement took part in the staging of \\"Le Th√©√¢tre de Neptune en la Nouvelle-France,\\" written by Lescarbot and performed at the first celebration Order, which was the first theatrical performance in North America. Founding Chevaliers The founding Chevaliers of the Order were those who normally dined at Sieur Poutrincourt's table. The main table of Poutrincourt, in the great hall of the fort was reserved for fifteen gentlemen of birth who are credited as the founding Matries d'Hotel or members of the Order and were known as The Nevoux Noblise of New France. According to official documents, Baron Poutrincourt was, no doubt, the Grand Knight of the Order, followed by Champlain, Lescarbot, Louis H√©bert, Charles de Biencourt, Claude de La Tour, Charles de La Tour, Daniel Hay, Champdore, leaving six unknown, but the records note that Sagamore Membertou was always treated as their equal; it is quite certain he was at that table, leaving five to be accounted for, if documents to that effect can be found. Lescarbot's account of the Order is best translated in Murdoch's (v. 1, p 34), in which is described the gathering of the Order: > There were 15 guests (at Poutrincourt's table), each of whom in his turn, > became steward and caterer of the day. At the dinner, the steward, with > napkin on shoulder, staff of office in hand, and the collar of the order > round his neck, led the van. The other guests in procession followed, each > bearing a dish. After grace in the evening, he resigned the insignia to his > successor, and they drank to each other in a cup of wine. It was the > steward's duty, to look to supplies, and he would go hunt or fish a day or > two before his turn came, and add some dainty to the ordinary fare. During > the winter they had fowl and game in abundance, supplied by the Indians and > by their own exertions. These feasts were often attended by Indians of all > ages and both sexes, sometimes twenty or thirty being present. The Sagamore, > or chief, Membertou, the greatest Sagamore of the land, and other chiefs, > when there, were treated as guests and equals. Champlain's account of the Order: > We spent this winter very joyously and of good times, due to the L'Odre de l > Bon Temps that I established here, which each person finds useful for their > health and more beneficial than any sort of medicine that we could have > used. The Order was presented as a Chain of office that we placed with some > small ceremony, at the neck of one of our people, charging him that day with > going hunting; the next day we gave it to another and thus consequently: all > who wished to try would do their best and bring the most beautiful hunt: We > don't find it half bad , as well as the Indians who were with us. (Voyages > of Champlain: 1613) Description of the order of Good Cheer: > The first winters of the French in Acadie were very painful and cost the > life of several men. One has to only think of the first winter in the > Sainte-Croix Island in 1604-1605 when more than thirty men of the company > the sieur de Mons perished by the scurvy. The winters in Port-Royal were > less rigorous, but nonetheless long and dull. > To brighten the atmosphere and foster the esprit de corps amongst the sieur > de Poutrincourt, lord of Port-Royal's staff members, Samuel de Champlain had > the idea to create \\"the order of Good-Cheer\\" during the winter 1606-1607. In > turn, the members of the small elite of Port-Royal were to prepare a > gastronomical meal for their fellow-members, with the fruit of their hunting > and fishing in the rich Acadian natural environment plentiful with game and > fish of various kinds. From time to time, the sagamo Membertou and its close > relations were also invited to share the feast during which the person in > charge of the eve entered ceremoniously in the main room of the Habitation > wearing around his neck the collar of the Order that he would tend to the > future host of the next evening.

In the past the company has been known as both \\"Federal Hotels\\" or \\"Federal Hotels and Resorts\\". Federal Group is Tasmania‚Äôs largest private sector employer with employees located across the entire state. The Federal Group is owned and operated by the Farrell family, consisting of Greg Farrell (managing director), John Farrell (director of business development), Julia Farrell (director of interior design), Deborah Lee (n√©e Farrell; board member) and Jane Farrell (board member). History =Federal Coffee Palace= Federal is the oldest continually operating hotel group in Australia. Its origins can be traced to Melbourne in the 1880s. In June 1885, a company named The Federal Coffee Palace Company Limited built an elegant temperance establishment (‚ÄòCoffee Palace‚Äô) to coincide with the 1888 Centennial Exhibition.Sutton, Keith Blueprint for the Casino industry : Federal Hotels and Wrest Point Canberra: K. Sutton, c1992 Seven stories high, it was the tallest building in Melbourne. It had 450 bedrooms and the largest dining room in Australia. During the Depression of the late 1880s and early 1890s, the Coffee Palace lost significant amounts of money. This prompted its directors to obtain a liquor licence in order to attract more profitable clientele. The original coffee palace was renamed the Hotel Federal and it went on to become the cornerstone of what is now Federal Group. Over the next few decades Federal operated several hotels, including The Menzies, Savoy Plaza, The Windsor, Hotel Australia, Lennons Hotel in Brisbane and Hampton Court in Sydney. =Australia's first casino= In 1956, Federal bought its first Tasmanian business ‚Äì the Wrest Point Riviera Hotel in Sandy Bay, Hobart. During the late 1960s Federal initiated discussions with the Tasmanian Government about granting the Wrest Point Riviera Hotel Australia's first casino licence. The casino was initially conceived to address the seasonal nature of Tasmania‚Äôs tourism industry, designed to be an attraction that would entice visitors to the state all year round. In a referendum held on 14 December 1968, Tasmanian voters were asked the following question: ‚ÄúAre you in favour of the granting of a casino licence to Wrest Point Hotel conditional on the proposed development of that hotel?‚Äù In spite of having a referendum planned, the Government managed to obtain sufficient votes on the floor of the parliament. They therefore decided to ignore the referendum, and hold the vote prior to the referendum, and the bill was passed as law. This process was also mired in allegations of corruption and bribery, especially with regards to Kevin Lyons, who held the balance of power. By a slim 6% majority, the establishment of a casino in Hobart was accepted and the Wrest Point Casino Licence and Development Act of 1968 was passed. On 10 February 1973 Australia‚Äôs first legal casino opened with great spectacle. The event featured the largest fireworks display ever seen in the country, and was televised through the Channel 7 network. American entertainer Jerry Lewis was the main guest artist. The initial response to the casino exceeded expectations. More than 2,000 people visited the casino on the first Sunday it opened. The hotel was booked out for the first 3 months. However, the reality of the casino soon set in. While it was initially supposed to be an entertainment and convention centre with a small casino, the casino soon took over the building with many poker machines filling the complex. The restrictions around the casino and the presence of poker machines in the community were gradually lifted, until they were widespread. The expected boon to tourism also disappeared as the vast majority of the significant losses at the machines were Tasmanian residents. =Second casino licence= In 1979, Federal Group secured a second casino licence in Northern Tasmania. The Country Club Casino and Resort was opened in 1982 and the adjacent Country Club villas were acquired by the company some years later. Architects modelled the style and interior design of Country Club on the stately homes of America‚Äôs south. Former Chairman Greg Farrell senior had always admired the simple lines of the US Embassy building in Canberra and believed that the Georgian style would work well in the rural landscape of Launceston. The casino is now surrounded by suburbs and local neighbourhoods. = Other gambling assets = With the monopoly over the poker machines in the state, and all the data of where the most profitable locations were. They then purchased a chain of bottle shops to attach to these locations. Controversy In a 2017, book entitled \\"Losing Streak\\", the Tasmanian author James Boyce argues that the monopoly-licence granted to the Federal Hotels to operate poker machines in Tasmania has been at the expense of the best interests of the Tasmania public. The licence has meant that Federal Hotels have earned around $30 million for the past 30 years.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-05/how-federal-hotels-monopolised- pokies-in-tasmania/8417568 A parliamentary enquiry called for a significant reduction of machines, and changing the deal with Federal Group. It is estimated that clubs only take in 10-30% of all pokies losses, with the lions share going to Federal Group, for which they pay a minimal amount to the government in taxes. = 2018 election and potential pokie ban = In August 2017, Federal Group agreed to give up their monopoly on the poker machines, if in return they would receive a reduction in their taxes (which are already the lowest gambling taxes in Australia). The Liberal government also stated that they agree to the presence of the pokies but they will not necessarily grant those licences exclusively to Federal Group. In December 2017 the Labor Party opposition under its new leader, Rebecca White, announced that if elected they would phase out all poker machines from pubs and clubs by 2023. The reasons cited were the health implications, and that Tasmanians could not afford to lose the more than $110 million it loses every year. In response Federal Group attacked the plan as dangerous and that it would lead to job losses, and said they would stop donating to the Labor Party. The Liberal Party mostly fell in line with Federal Group, even using Federal Group's own promotional material to attack Labor. Over half of the Liberal Party's declared donations, over $400,000, for the election were given to them by gambling interests. There has been wide spread support for the Labor policy. The Greens have been calling for the pokies ban for many years, and the Jacquie Lambie Network also coming out in support. Others in support include David Walsh, the owner of the MONA gallery, and major opponent of the pokies. Public opinion also strongly supports either a reduction or phasing out of pokies.

Mongol armour drew its influence from Chinese, Middle Eastern, and Central Asian styles. Most Mongolian armour was of scale and lamellar variety. Most armour was made of hardened leather and iron, laced together onto a fabric backing, sometimes silk. Mail armour was also sometimes used, but was rare, probably due to its weight and difficulty to repair. Mongol archers demanded the armour be light enough so that when riding, it didn't interfere with their mobility. It is also possible that the Mongol armour lacked mail and was generally lighter than its counterparts to the East and West because the nomadic habits of the Mongols were not conducive to the labour-intensive practices and permanent facilities necessary for making mail or large plates. Sometimes arm protection was removed so that a rider could draw their bow easier. The helmet was made of mostly iron, but leather and other materials were also used. Lamellar armour was also used by the countries that were affected by the invasion of the Mongols worldwide, including the conquest of China and the Middle East. This is especially shown by Tamerlane, a debatably Mongol warlord of the 15th century that used lamellar armour consistently with his cavalry, and garbed himself and his men in Mongolian armour during war. Genghis Khan was once said to have issued all his horsemen with silk vests, as an arrow hitting silk does not break the silk but ends up embedding the arrow in the flesh wrapped in silk, allowing the arrow to be removed by gently teasing the silk open. This is opposed to the usual method of removing barbed arrows‚Äîcutting them out, or pushing them right through an injured limb and out of the other side. These silk vests functioned much like the padded armour used by European and Byzantine soldiers of the era, such as the gambeson.Turnbull, Stephen. (2003). Mongol Warrior 1200 - 1500.

The community has a population of 476, but receives frequent tourists from Calgary. The local Fairmont Hot Springs Resort is centered around a soak pool and swimming pool fed by natural mineral hot springs, billing them as \\"Canada's largest natural mineral hot springs\\". The original springs building, surrounded by hot spring water seeping out of the ground, still stands. The community contains three golf courses: Mountainside and Riverside are 18-hole courses, while Creekside is a family-oriented 9-hole par 3. In the winter, the area is also home to a small downhill ski area, with three lifts (one double chair and two surface lifts), 13 runs and a tube park, as well as numerous cross-country trails. Fairmont Hot Springs Resort and all three golf courses were purchased by Ontario-based Ken Fowler Enterprises (KFE) in 2006 and 2007. Fairmont Hot Springs has a strip mall including Mountainside Market, Rockies Pizzeria, Fairmont Village Gift Shop, and a Greek restaurant: Tony's Greek Grill and Juice Bar. Fairmont Hot Springs is home to the Dutch Creek Hoodoos, which are sandstone cliffs (hoodoos) with hiking trails located next to Dutch Creek, a source of the Columbia River and formally a salmon breeding stream. Fairmont provides the only road access to Columbia Lake Provincial Park, five kilometers south. Fairmont Hot Springs Airport is located here. Although not directly within Fairmont Hot Springs, directly south and within the Fairmont Hot Springs Fire District is the Spruce Grove Campground, Hoodoos Campground, Dutch Creek Village, Dutch Creek RV Resort, Coy's Dutch Creek Par 3 Golf Course and Columere. On July 15, 2012, Fairmont Hot Springs was hit by a mudslide. A small creek that runs throughout Fairmont formed a natural dam and backup water built up. Several homes were evacuated along with Mountainside Golf Course and many people were airlifted to safety. No injuries occurred but the resort suffered for several weeks as Mountainside Golf Course and the Fairmont Hot Springs Lodge were closed. The businesses have since reopened. To the north are Invermere, Athalmer, Wilmer, Radium, Edgewater, and Golden. To the south are Canal Flats, Scookumchuck, Kimberley, and Cranbrook.

Conservation authorities represent groupings of municipalities on a watershed basis and work in partnership with other agencies to carry out natural resource management activities within their respective watersheds, on behalf of their member municipalities and the Province of Ontario. The 1946 Conservation Authorities Act provides the means by which municipalities within a common watershed can petition the Province of Ontario to form a conservation authority for that watershed to undertake programs of natural resource management. Conservation authorities are established as corporate bodies under the Act. Conservation Authorities Act, e-Laws. There are currently 36 conservation authorities in Ontario. Conservation authorities are mandated to develop programs to further the conservation, restoration, development and management of Ontario's natural resources. They carry out programs in natural hazard management on behalf of the province and municipalities, and may also carry out other programs that serve municipal interests, such as nature education, land conservation and management, recreation programs, and research. Management programs generally occur in lands known as conservation areas, restoration areas or wilderness areas, though not all lands managed are necessarily designated as such. Conservation authorities' primary responsibilities are in natural hazard management and environmental protection. While all conservation authorities carry out natural hazard management programs, their roles in environmental protection vary significantly because these are determined by local municipalities.  Structure  Each conservation authority is governed by a board of directors made up of representatives from its member municipalities. The number of representatives each municipality can have is determined by the Conservation Authorities Act based on its population within the watershed. Board members act on behalf of the municipalities they represent. Boards collectively determine the direction of authorities including the programs they will carry out and operational decisions throughout the year. For most matters, each member is entitled to one vote, and decisions are made by majority vote. For voting on non-matching levies (levies against municipalities which are not matched by the Province), voting is done using a weighted vote, where each municipality has the same share of the vote as the share of the budget that it pays, except that no municipality can have more than 50% of the vote. If a municipality pays more than 50% of the budget, its share of the vote is capped at 50% and the shares of other municipalities are increased proportionately. Conservation authorities are administered by a General Manager or Chief Administrative Officer who reports to the Board.  Funding  Conservation authorities' funding comes from a variety of sources. Conservation authorities have the power to generate revenue through fees and other self-generated revenue, and also the power to levy their member municipalities. As registered charities, they are eligible for certain government grants. Under Section 39 of the Conservation Authorities Act, the Province may also provide grants to conservation authorities. Historically, conservation authorities' funding was split evenly between the Province and member municipalities. In the mid-1990s, under the Red Tape Reduction Act of the Progressive Conservative government, conservation authorities' provincial funding was drastically reduced from more than million annually divided among all the authorities to $8 million, and the Province reduced the scope of its support to natural hazard management programs and programs for protecting provincially significant conservation land, although the $8 million in funding was exclusively for natural hazard management. Other programs were considered to be only in the local interest and the Province stated that those programs could be funded by municipalities if the municipalities wished them to continue. At the same time, the government provided conservation authorities with new powers to charge fees and generate revenue. As a result, most conservation authorities became more entrepreneurial to generate the revenue needed to continue their local programming. Funding was further cut by 5% to $7.6 million in 2000. In 2012, under the Liberal government, funding was cut again by 2% to $7.448 million, and in 2019, under the Progressive Conservative government, it was cut again by 48% to $3.58 million. The Province also provides funding to conservation authorities for the implementation of the Clean Water Act, brought in as a result of the inquiry into the E. coli outbreak in Walkerton in 2000 which resulted in six deaths, which is meant to identify threats to and protect drinking water sources. Annual budgets are determined by the board of directors. The portion to be funded by municipal levy (payment by member municipalities) is divided among the participating municipalities according to a formula set out in Ontario Regulation 670/00 which is based on the total value of all lands within each municipality, multiplied by modifiers in the regulation and by the proportion of the municipality which falls within the authority's jurisdiction, as a proportion of the total modified value within the authority's jurisdiction. For example, if 30% of a municipality's area falls within an authority's jurisdiction, and the total value of land in that municipality after applying modifiers is 10 million dollars, 3 million dollars is the value used to calculated the municipality's share of the levy (30% x 10 million). If the total value in the jurisdiction, after adding together all such values for all the participating municipalities, is 20 million dollars, the municipality's share of the levy is 15% (3 million divided by 20 million). In 2013, municipal levies accounted for approximately 48% of all conservation authorities' revenue; self-generated revenue accounted for 40%; provincial funding, including the natural hazards management funding as well as Clean Water Act funding and various other grants for special projects, accounted for 10%; and federal funding, for special projects and Areas of Concern, 2%.  Role in natural hazard management  Each conservation authority has a Regulation of Development, Interference with Wetlands and Alterations to Shorelines and Watercourses under the Conservation Authorities Act which conforms to a provincial template regulation. Under these regulations, conservation authorities regulate development and other activities in and near natural hazard areas such as shorelines, floodplains, unstable slopes, wetlands, and other hazardous lands, such as karst topography and Leda clay. Development is prohibited in areas designated by the regulation unless permission is granted by the conservation authority. Landowners or developers may need permits from a conservation authority, similar to a building permit, to do work such as constructing buildings or placing fill in these areas. These regulations were put in place after the devastating impacts of Hurricane Hazel in 1954. Conservation authorities also do flood forecasting and warning, flood and erosion control, ice management and drought programs, and contribute to municipal land use planning.  Role in environmental protection  Conservation authorities may have programs to protect local ecosystems and contribute to the quality of life in communities throughout the province. Some of the activities conservation authorities may include: *Water resource management - Conservation authorities carry out research and activities to manage Ontario's water resources on a watershed basis, maintain secure supplies of clean water, and contribute to municipal planning processes. *Stewardship - conservation authorities collectively own about 146,000 hectares of land in Ontario. They also may work with landowners to plant trees or make other environmental improvements to private property, such as helping farmers improve drainage systems. *Recreation - conservation authorities own over 400 conservation areas for public use, with 8,400 campsites and almost 2,500 kilometers of trails. *Science, data collection and monitoring - conservation authorities may collect a variety of information about their watersheds, including about water quality, land use, and types of lands (e.g., amount of wetlands and forest cover). *Education - through school programs, at conservation authority facilities, and through participation at local events and festivals  List of conservation authorities  Conservation Ontario is the umbrella organization for all 36 regional Conservation Authorities in the Province of Ontario: * Ausable Bayfield Conservation Authority * Cataraqui Region Conservation Authority * Catfish Creek Conservation Authority * Central Lake Ontario Conservation Authority * Conservation Halton * Credit Valley Conservation * Crowe Valley Conservation Authority * Essex Region Conservation Authority * Ganaraska Region Conservation Authority * Grand River Conservation Authority * Grey Sauble Conservation * Hamilton Conservation Authority * Kawartha Conservation * Kettle Creek Conservation Authority * Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority * Lakehead Region Conservation Authority * Long Point Region Conservation Authority * Lower Thames Valley Conservation Authority * Lower Trent Conservation * Maitland Valley Conservation Authority * Mattagami Region Conservation Authority * Mississippi Valley Conservation * Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority * Nickel District Conservation Authority * North Bay- Mattawa Conservation Authority * Nottawasaga Valley Conservation Authority * Otonabee Region Conservation Authority * Quinte Conservation * Raisin Region Conservation Authority * Rideau Valley Conservation Authority * Saugeen Conservation * Sault Ste.

In 2016, it had a population of 668.http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp- pd/prof/92-591/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1;=CSD&Code1;=5901043&Geo2;=PR&Code2;=59&Data;=Count&SearchText;=Canal&SearchType;=Begins&SearchPR;=01&B1;=All&Custom;= Location Canal Flats is on Highway 93/95, in the Kootenay River Valley, part of the Rocky Mountain Trench, between Skookumchuck and Fairmont Hot Springs. The population was 700 in 2020. Timber was the main industry in the village for over one hundred years but in 2015 the sawmill closed for good. An entrepreneurial group came to town in 2018 and purchased 1000 acres and set up the Columbia Lake Technology Center as well as a data center design, build and operate company under the name PodTech. PodTech was later purchased in January 2020 by an Australian company called Iris Energy and is growing the operations quickly. Canal Flats is the gateway to several backcountry provincial parks, including Whiteswan and Top of the World, and is an entrance to the Kootenay River Road. Canal Flats sits 1 kilometre from the southern end of the 16-kilometre long Columbia Lake, the source of the Columbia River that flows north to Kinbasket Lake before turning south to finally empty into the Pacific Ocean at Astoria, Oregon, a journey of 1,225 miles (1,960 km). Columbia Lake lies squeezed between two walls of rock; the Purcell Mountains to the west and the Rocky Mountains to the east. The Kootenay River Valley area was a major transportation corridor in pre-Contact native America and the early years of western exploration. A low, 1.2-mile (2-km) wide berm of land called Canal Flats separates the headwaters of the Columbia, which flows north at its beginning, from the south-flowing Kootenay River. The Kootenay meanders down into the US before flowing back north into Canada to join the Columbia River at Castlegar, BC. Canal Flats was originally named McGillivray's Portage by David Thompson, who passed through the area in 1808. Not far from the Tilley Memorial Park (formerly Canal Flats Provincial Park) are the remains of a canal, completed in 1889, which connected Columbia Lake with the nearby Kootenay River, hence the name Canal Flats given to the post office in 1913. Baillie-Grohman Canal Canal Flats at the south end of Columbia Lake The canal was part of a scheme by English/Austrian entrepreneur William Adolf Baillie Grohman in the 1880s to breach Canal Flats and divert water from the upper Kootenay River into the Columbia system, thereby sufficiently lowering the level of Kootenay Lake to reclaim the rich alluvial plain in the Creston area and open up a north-south navigational system from Golden to Montana. The scheme was abandoned under pressure from the Canadian Pacific Railways, concerned about its Columbia River crossings, and from settlers around Golden who feared that their farmlands would be flooded.Downs, Art, Paddlewheels on the Frontier -- The Story of British Columbia and Yukon Sternwheel Steamers, at 101-113, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1972 Baillie-Grohman had to settle for building a canal and lock system between the two rivers, completed in 1889. Only two ships ever passed through the canal; in 1895 the sternwheeler Gwendoline successfully navigated the canal from the Kootenay River to the Columbia River, followed in 1902 by the North Star. The canal builder owned the first store and post office in the community as well as the first steam sawmill in the valley, the start of the lumber industry that has put Canal Flats on the map. Canal Days Party On the first weekend in June, Canal Flats holds their annual Canal Days Party. Events include a talent show, parades, pancake breakfast, beer garden, raffles, and naming the Canal Flats Citizen of the Year.

Its fossils have been found in South Australia. It can be recognised by touching glabella and frontal border, and the sub-pentagonal head, as compared to, a short field between the front of the axis in the head or glabella and the border ridge, and a semi-circular headsheald in the sister-genus Balcoracania. Both emuellid genera share eye ridges that are positioned parallel to the frontal and lateral border of the head, prominent genal spines that are a smooth continuation of the lateral margin of the head, a prothorax of 6 segments, with the 5th and 6th merged and carrying large trailing spines. Both genera have in adulthood a highly variable but large number of segments of the opistothorax, although the largest number found in B. dailyi with 97 is much larger than in Emuella (52).  Etymology  The genus name means \\"little emu\\", and refers to Emu Bay, on Kangaroo Island, one of the sites where fossils of Emuella have been collected. The species epithet polymera is derived from Greek words œÄŒøŒªœç -poly- meaning \\"many\\"; and ŒºŒ≠œÅŒøœÇ -meros- meaning \\"part\\", for the many segmented thorax. E. dalgarnoi is named after R.C.

Founded in 1852, the school was named after Queen Victoria, and is owned and administered by the island's government, the States of Jersey. As a fee- charging school and a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), Victoria College is often referred to as either a private or public school in the British sense of the term, despite being government- provided. The school is selective, meaning prospective pupils must pass an entrance exam to be offered a place; students come predominantly from white British families. The school charges ¬£2,060 per term, with three terms per academic year, as of 2020/2021 and was noted as being the seventh-least expensive day school in the HMC in 2014. The senior school has about 650 boys aged 11 to 18, with a further 250 boys aged 7 to 11 at the associated preparatory school, which was established in 1966. History = Foundation = An illustration of the laying of the school's foundation stone The foundation stone of the school was laid on Queen Victoria's birthday, 24 May 1850. Most shops in Saint Helier closed for the day and 12,000 spectators were estimated to have attended the occasion. A military parade crossed the town of Saint Helier to the site of the ceremony, followed shortly afterwards by the members of the States of Jersey who adjourned the legislative sitting to attend. The Lieutenant-Governor of Jersey joined the dignitaries at the Temple in the grounds of the site. The Bailiff of Jersey laid in the foundations a box containing copies of the Acts of the States relating to the college, Jersey coins, and two medallions, one of silver, the other of bronze, depicting the arrival of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in Jersey in 1846, and a copper plate engraved with an inscription of the date of the founding of the college and the names of States Members, Officers of the Royal Court and the architect. With the foundation stone, carved with Masonic symbols, in place, the Lieutenant-Governor ceremonially laid the stone by striking it with a trowel. All the Members of the States in turn then proceeded to tap the stone with a mallet three times.La Chronique de Jersey, 25 May 1850 The school was opened on 29 September 1852 with 98 students enrolled.La Chronique de Jersey, 29 September 1852 The accompanying ceremony featured a military parade, and the Lieutenant-Governor and the States of Jersey again assembled in the Temple and processed to the Great Hall where the Bailiff addressed the audience. He recalled the royal visit of 1846 and stated that the intention of memorialising that visit had inspired the construction of a college for the instruction of youth and of promenades for the recreation of the public. He stated that the interest shown by the Queen and the Prince in the college had led them to present two portraits. The Lieutenant-Governor then formally presented the portraits of the royal couple. The quality of the portraits, copies of Winterhalter, was criticised in the press.La Chronique de Jersey, 2 October 1852 The initial uniform consisted of a jacket, waistcoat and trousers in black or dark green, and a cap of the same colour. = World war period = By the end of the 19th century, the school had gained a reputation for producing students who would go on to study at military colleges in the United Kingdom including Woolwich and Sandhurst or take up direct appointments in the military, naval and civil service of the armed forces. At a time where the British Empire was at its height, this reputation came as no surprise with many students' parents being former officers and colonial administrators and with there being a strong military influence in the island at the time. Within the first twenty-five years of the institution of the Victoria Cross in 1856, three Old Victorians were awarded the honour for their services, with two further alumni receiving the award for their service during World War I. College House building was commandeered by the occupying German forces in 1940 In early 1940 the school remained largely unaffected by the outbreak of war in Europe, and although many young Jerseymen had left the island to join the war effort, several English parents had sent their sons to board at the school, believing the Channel Islands to be the safest place in the British Isles. However, developments in the war throughout May that year and the eventual collapse of French resistance meant it became clear the island was in danger. The Channel Islands were demilitarised in the belief that this would best protect the lives of the islanders, meaning many feared the imminent occupation of the islands by German forces. While many other schools in Jersey left evacuation decisions in the hands of parents, Victoria College decided to evacuate some boys and their masters to the UK where they stayed for the remainder of World War II attending English public schools including Shrewsbury School and Bedford School. However, around 130 boys and several masters remained in Jersey, and the school continued to operate during the occupation. Early on during the occupation, the German forces commandeered College House building for the Reich Labour Service,Balleine's History of Jersey, Marguerite Syvret and Joan Stevens (1998) but otherwise did not significantly disrupt the normal routine of the school for much of 1941. However, in September that year, German forces took possession of the remaining school buildings, forcing the students and masters to relocate to Halkett Place school. Around a year later, another blow was dealt to the school as several English-born masters and staff were deported to Germany, though substitutes were found and the school remained open. Soon thereafter, however, in October 1942 the German forces returned the buildings to the school. Only minimal damage had been done to the buildings, with the hall windows partially painted black, and by 1943 the school had restored the building to its original state. Life in Jersey became increasingly worse for the remainder of the occupation, as there was no gas nor electricity and food supplies were increasingly scarce. As a result, afternoon schooling was discontinued, homework not issued, and sports were only played on a small scale. British food-parcels arrived early in 1945, relieving some of the hardship suffered by islanders, and eventually on 8 May 1945 the headmaster relayed news of Victory in Europe and all 175 boys were dismissed to join the celebrations. = Modern period = A plaque commemorating the school's 150th anniversary in 2002 A memorial service was held on 2 June 1946 in the main hall to remember Old Victorians who died in the war. The school quickly returned to its normal functioning, and the next few years saw a range of developments including a wider range of subjects and the building of a new sports pavilion and art building. By 1952, the school was in a state fit to celebrate its centenary, which was marked by a visit from the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. This development continued into the next decade as an associated preparatory school was opened in 1966. The school's 125 year anniversary was commemorated by Jersey Post in 1977 with an issue of special stamps on 29 September 1977. In the late 1990s, the school was involved in a highly publicised child abuse scandal concerning a maths teacher at the school, Andrew Jervis-Dykes, and the attempts by staff at the school to cover up the abuse. Allegations were made against Jervis-Dykes in 1992 and 1994, but on both occasions, the school's headmaster, Jack Hydes, failed to notify the police or investigate the allegations and instructed staff not to discuss the allegations. In 1996, thirteen pupils alleged that Jervis-Dykes had abused them on a Navy Cadet sailing trip, but again the allegations were dismissed by the school as rumours. However, a video showing Jervis-Dykes assaulting several boys subsequently emerged and Jervis-Dykes was arrested by Jersey Police; headmaster Jack Hydes and his deputy, Piers Baker, refused to engage in the investigation or identify the boys in the video. Eventually, in April 1999, Jervis-Dykes was sentenced and jailed for six counts of indecent assault against six school pupils whom he had given alcohol to before abusing them in their beds on school sailing trips between 1984 and 1993 and one count of possession of an indecent photograph of a child. The Sharp Report, instigated as a result of the investigation into Jervis-Dykes' actions and the actions of school staff, noted that \\"The handling of the complaint was more consistent with protecting a member of staff and the college's reputation in the short- term than safeguarding the best interests of the pupil\\", continuing to say \\"The reaction of the political establishment was to sweep this under the carpet and keep the veneer of respectability ... This is just another example of concealment and cover up. They did the bare minimum, prosecuted one perpetrator.\\" Both Hydes and Baker subsequently resigned from the school. In the Independent Jersey Care Inquiry, an inquiry investigating child abuse in Jersey launched in 2014, a member of the island's Child Protection Team said that many of his colleagues were alumni of the school and therefore did not offer any support to the investigation into Jervis-Dykes as they did not want the school's reputation \\"dragged through the mud.\\"  School structure  In the style of the English public school system, the school operates on a house system.Victoria College, Jersey, 1852‚Äì1972, Cottrill, D.J., Phillimore & Co Ltd, There are five houses‚ÄîBraithwaite, Bruce, Diarmid, Dunlop and Sartorius‚Äînamed after alumni of the school distinguished for their military service and each house has its own respective house room. Various house flags are hung atop the east tower of the school's main building, each celebrating a variety of achievements of each house every month throughout the year. Teaching at the school is delivered over 25 periods a week divided into 60-minute lessons, with a typical school day starting at 8:25 am and finishing at 3:25 pm. Year groups are divided into five tutor groups of either 23 or 24 students divided by house, each overseen by a dedicated tutor.  Governance  A photograph of one of the school buildings in 2007 The school is owned by the States of Jersey and is governed by a board of governors made up of parent governors, invited governors selected \\"to reflect an appropriate balance of interests and to help provide links with the local community\\", and staff governors. All staff, including the school's headmaster, are employees of Jersey's Education Department, a non-executive body within the States of Jersey. It is headed by the Chief Education Officer, to which all staff and the headmaster of the school directly report. Its role is supportive, providing advice and mediation practices, and to ensure accountability. Jersey's Human Resource department controls the recruitment of staff and governors in conjunction with the school, making appropriate checks to ensure all are suitable. An inspection report by the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) in 2017 found that \\"Governors provide suitable support and guidance for the college ... and they monitor the quality of procedures\\", noting also that \\"The Jersey Education Department and governors of the schools ensure that the leadership and management demonstrate good skills and knowledge, and fulfil their responsibilities effectively so that the other standards are consistently met and they actively promote the well-being of the pupils.\\" As well as being fee-charging, the school is also a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC). As a result, the school is often referred to as a private school in the British sense of the term, despite being owned by the States of Jersey.  Admissions  The senior school accepts pupils between the ages of 11 and 18, and its associated preparatory school accepts pupils between the ages of 7 and 11. The senior school is selective, meaning admission is based on ability which is assessed by way of an entrance examination. Pupils of the preparatory school, who make up around 75% of the senior school's intake, are not required to sit such an assessment and are admitted automatically. Pupils are admitted from across the island from families with a wide range of professional backgrounds and predominantly from white British families; around 40% of pupils were born in the United Kingdom. As of 2020/2021, the school charges ¬£2,060 per term with three terms per academic year.  Curriculum  = Structure = From years 7 to 9, the school curriculum follows the island's curriculum programme. Beyond year 9, the school designs its own curriculum to provide a more tailored framework for pupils which conforms to English National Curriculum requirements. At GCSE level, in years 10 and 11, all students must take English, mathematics and physical education and they are expected to study a modern foreign language and religious studies, at least two sciences, and three optional subjects. At A-level, students will study three or four subjects over two years. Almost all boys at the school go on to study at universities in the UK. The school partially shares its teaching with the nearby Jersey College for Girls. An ISI report in 2017 noted that \\"The breadth of the curriculum, combined with ane extensive activity programme, provides pupils with experience in linguistic, mathematical, scientific, technological, human and social, physical, and aesthetic and creative education. Literacy, science and mathematics are emphasised with a particular focus on improving literacy standards\\" describing the curriculum as \\"well planned and timetabled with suitable schemes of work.\\" = Examinations = Students are entered for GCSE and IGCSE examinations in years 10 and 11 and A-level examinations in the sixth-form. A 2017 ISI report found that \\"The majority of pupils attain high standards in public examinations\\", finding that, for the period 2014 to 2016, GCSE results were consistently above the UK national average for maintained schools with nearly half of all papers graded A or A*, IGCSE results in biology and physics were higher than worldwide norms, and two-thirds of A-level results were graded A* to B.  Extracurricular activities  L'Appel du 18 juin A wide range of extracurricular activities are offered at the school. Students participate in a range of sports, arts, music and local events, as well as the school's combined cadet force (CCF). Students also participate in The Duke of Edinburgh's Award programme. Regular contests in cricket, hockey and rifle shooting have been held against rivals Elizabeth College for over a century. An ISI report in 2017 found that the level of extracurricular achievement at the school was \\"excellent\\" and described the CCF as \\"a real strength of the school\\", noting in particular its success in target rifle shooting, where students regularly make selection for UK and British cadet teams. School site The school occupies an extensive area on the hills above Saint Helier and facing the bay of Saint-Malo. The neo-gothic main building, finished in 1852, remains in use and houses the great hall, libraries and administrative areas. Newer developments including classrooms, a music centre, science suite, design and technology suite, computer suites, theatre and sixth form centre surround the historic building. The school shares some of its facilities with the Jersey College for Girls located on the adjacent site. The school owns or has access to a wide range of sporting facilities. Adjacent to the main buildings lie several playing fields, and the main site also includes a 25-yard shooting range and squash courts. The school, along with the Jersey College for Girls, uses the Langford sports centre during term times, which provides a 25-metre swimming pool, dance studio, gymnasium and sports hall. The school's main building was described by David Ansted and Robert Latham as \\"a handsome building, well placed, overlooking the town on the eastern side, and from one direction is extremely picturesque\\" in their book, The Channel Islands, published in 1862.  Notable alumni  The school's alumni are often referred to as Old Victorians. Notable alumni of the school in the military include five Victoria Cross holders, Henry William Pitcher,Editorial Team, Soci√©t√© Jersiaise, (Autumn 2006), Soci√©t√© Jersiaise Newsletter, vol.45, page 7, (Soci√©t√© Jersiaise: Jersey) William Bruce, Allastair McReady-Diarmid, and brothers Reginald and Euston Sartorius. Principals The school's first headmaster was William Henderson. A graduate of Magdalen College, Oxford, Henderson was headmaster at the school for ten years from 1852 until 1862. The school's current headmaster is Alun Watkins, who took up the post in 2010 following the retirement of Bob Cook.

Artists Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians recorded the song on 30 April 1947 and released it on the 78 rpm record Decca 23948.Entry for Decca 23948 on http://www.discogs.com (including image of disc label). Accessed 13 March 2012.. The Delta Rhythm Boys recorded it in 1950 under the name \\"Dry Bones\\". A recording of the song by the Canadian vocal group The Four Lads was featured prominently in \\"Fall Out\\", the final episode of the 1967-68 science fiction series, The Prisoner. The song is also performed at several points in the episode, most notably when the character of Number 48 spontaneously begins to lip sync to the recording in order to disrupt a ceremony involving the show's protagonist, Number 6. Later, several characters are shown dancing to the same recording. Fred Gwynne performs a solo version, accompanying himself on guitar, in a 1965 episode of the Munsters: \\"Will Success Spoil Herman Munster\\".

It operates on a non profit basis, injecting any income back into the project. The shop has been based in different locations and mainly sells books on anarchism, feminism, indigenous rights, ecology and a range of activist issues. It also carries patches, badges, clothing and music.  History  The Freedom Shop was established on May 1, 1995. It was based on upper Cuba Street in Te Aro, in a building formerly occupied by the NORML shop. To begin with, NORML continued to pay the rent. The shop was run by volunteers and any profits were ploughed back into the venture. The shop sold books, magazines, pamphlets, leaflets, T-shirts, patches, records, and stickers. In the 2000s, plans for the construction of the Wellington Inner City Bypass meant that the Freedom Shop would be evicted. However, the plans were bitterly contested. When security guards employed by Transit NZ broke into the shop and changed the locks, 50 activists broke in and briefly re-opened it. The Freedom Shop moved into a more prominent location in the Cake Shop (a community infoshop/internet cafe in mid Cuba St). When the Cake Shop closed in 2005, the Freedom Shop relocated to Oblong (a community infoshop/internet cafe) in Te Aro's left bank arcade. Oblong closed in early 2009, and The Freedom Shop reverted to running stalls at public events. However, for the last few years the Freedom Shop has a home in a corner of the Newtown Opportunity for Animals Co-op Shop in Riddiford St, Newtown, Wellington.  Publications  In 2014, the collective published the first issue of a periodical called AARGH! as the Aoteroa Anarchist Review. Issue ten was published in April 2019.  Affiliations  The collective maintains close links with Aotearoa Indymedia and local radical groups such as the 128 Community Centre.

She is currently a Stanford University women's basketball assistant coach. Early life and college career Paye was born at the medical center of Stanford University's hospital, and was raised in Woodside, California in a family of Stanford student-athletes. Both of her parents, her sister and brother all went to the school. Her father was a running back for Stanford's football team while her brother John was a guard for Stanford's basketball team and quarterback for the Cardinal in the mid-1980s, and later was her basketball coach at Menlo School. At Menlo, Kate led the team to three consecutive California Interscholastic Federation Division V state basketball championships from 1989 to 1991. After high school, she was recruited by (and turned down) Harvard University, Princeton University and Dartmouth College. Stanford never recruited her, so Paye attended its women's basketball team training camp as a walk-on and tried out. She was accepted and won a spot as a point guard on the team. In her freshman year in 1992, she played on Stanford's 1992 championship team and earned a scholarship for the following year. She graduated in 1995 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science.  ABL and WNBA  In 1996, Paye began her professional basketball career with the Seattle Reign in the American Basketball League (ABL) for three seasons until the league folded. She later joined the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) in 2000, and played for the Minnesota Lynx for two seasons. After she was waived by Lynx in May 2002, she signed a free agent contract with the Seattle Storm and played for them in the 2002 season. During her WNBA career, she spent the offseason pursuing a JD/MBA degree. And in the Spring of 2003, she graduated from Stanford Law School with a Juris Doctor and the Stanford Graduate School of Business with a Masters in Business Administration.  Coaching career  She started her coaching career in 1995, after graduating from Stanford, to briefly serve as an assistant coach at San Diego State University. But she left the following year to embark upon her playing career in the ABL. After her playing career ended, Paye returned to coaching when she was hired as a women's basketball assistant coach and recruiting coordinator at Pepperdine University for the 2004-2005 season. In May 2005, Paye returned as an assistant coach for the San Diego State University Aztecs. Her duties included coaching the point guards and perimeter players, as well as scouting opposing teams and being involved with the Aztecs' recruitment efforts. In June 2007, Paye returned to Stanford as an assistant coach.

It consists of a row of 15 boathouses housing social and rowing clubs and their racing shells. Each of the boathouses has its own history, and all have addresses on both Boathouse Row and Kelly Drive (named after famous Philadelphia oarsman John B. Kelly Jr.). Boathouses #2 through #14 are part of a group known as the Schuylkill Navy, which encompasses several other boathouses along the river. Boathouse #1 is Lloyd Hall and is the only public boathouse facility on the Row. Boathouse #15 houses the Sedgeley Club, which operates the Turtle Rock Lighthouse. The boathouses are all at least a century old, and some were built over 150 years ago. History and importance Boathouse Row hosts several major rowing regattas, including the Aberdeen Dad Vail Regatta, Stotesbury Cup Regatta, the Navy Day Regatta, the Independence Day Regatta, and the Head of the Schuylkill. The boathouses are seen as centers of the rowing community around the United States. Rowers from the boathouses compete at every level, including local clubs, high schools, colleges, summer racing programs, and international-level athletics. Boathouses outlined with LED lights In 1979, lights designed by architectural lighting designer Ray Grenald were installed to outline each of the boathouses, giving them a nightly Christmas-like gingerbread house appearance and reflecting in the Schuylkill River. He proposed the lights after hearing talk of destroying the decaying Victorian boathouses. Lights on the buildings at night would serve to make them more noticed and appreciated. In 2005, after two refurbishings, the houses were outfitted with computerized LEDs that can light up in various colors, depending on the event or season. Boathouse Row is a National Historic Landmark and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.National Registry of Historic Places Inventory--Nomination Form Local universities including Drexel, Penn, and La Salle row out of houses on Boathouse Row. Temple and Saint Joseph's row out of other boathouses along the Schuylkill that are not part of the Row. Early 19th century beginnings The history of Boathouse Row begins with the construction of the Fairmount Dam and the adjacent water works. The Dam was built in 1821 to keep brackish tidal waters from entering the city's water supply through the Fairmount Water Works, which had been completed in 1815. The Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company would become heavily involved in the improvements.Archer B. Hulbert, The Paths of Inland Commerce, A Chronicle of Trail, Road, and Waterway, Vol. 21 The Chronicles of America Series. Editor: Allen Johnson (1921) The dam initially submerged the rapids, and later developments transformed the stretch of the Schuylkill between the dam and East Falls from a tidal river into a slack water river resembling a very long freshwater lake. The placid man-made surface was ideal for ice skating in winter and rowing in summer. In 1835, the first regatta took place between the Blue Devils and the Imps Barge clubs. The excitement from the race sparked the formation of several barge clubs, many of them short-lived. The frame boathouses 9-10; double house at #7-8; and #6, with one-story condemned buildings in between (c. 1873) A secondary effect of taming the Schuylkill was that the calm water provided a breeding ground for mosquitoes, which drove wealthy residents from their riverside mansions. The abandoned estates were bought by the City of Philadelphia. In 1844, the City purchased the Lemon Hill Estate. The leaseholder of Lemon Hill operated a beer garden and allowed rowing and barge clubs to build frame structure boathouses on the Estate's property along the Schuylkill. In 1855, the City founded Fairmount Park by converting the Lemon Hill Estate, upon which the frame boathouses were built, into a public park. At the same time, some of the established clubs wanted to regulate the sport of rowing to prevent unscrupulous practices and fixed races. As a result, in 1858, the Schuylkill Navy was founded, which eventually transformed the professional sport of rowing into an amateur sport. In 1859, the City condemned the boathouses along the Schuylkill. Boathouses of 1860 Although the City condemned the frame boathouses, it passed an ordinance in 1860 to permit construction of three new boathouses for Pacific Barge Club, the clubs of the Schuylkill Navy, and the Philadelphia Skating Club. After 1860, without city approval, several clubs constructed one-story boathouses similar to the frame structures that the City had previously condemned and removed, but these newer boathouses were built with brick and stone. In 1868, following an expansion of Fairmount Park, the City ordered the removal of all of the one-story brick and stone boathouses except for buildings belonging to the Philadelphia Skating Club (#14 Boathouse Row), Pacific Barge Club (#2-3 Boathouse Row), and Bachelors Barge Club (#6). Post‚ÄìCivil War boathouses Boathouse Row, c. 1904-1912 Between 1869 and 1871, Pennsylvania Barge Club and Crescent Boat Club erected a double boathouse at #4 and #5 Boathouse Row. In 1871, the Fairmount Park commission allowed the University Barge Club and the Philadelphia Barge Club to build a double boathouse at #7-8 Boathouse Row. In 1873, Malta Boat Club and Vesper Boat Club built a double boathouse at #9 and #10 Boathouse Row. In 1874, College Boat Club built the boathouse at #11 Boathouse Row. In 1878, West Philadelphia Boat Club built #12 Boathouse Row. Five years later, in 1883, Undine Barge Club constructed #13 Boathouse Row. In 1892, with Crescent's permission, Pennsylvania Barge Club tore down and replaced their half of the double boathouse at #4 Boathouse Row. In 1894, Bachelors Barge Club replaced its 1860 building at #6 Boathouse Row. In 1902, the Sedgeley Club was allowed to build #15 Boathouse Row. In 1904, Fairmount Rowing Association demolished the stone building built by Pacific Barge Club at #2 Boathouse Row and replaced the 1860 structure with a new brick structure, leaving #3 and #14 Boathouse Row as the only remaining boathouses dating from 1860.

History =Humber Estuary= \\"The archaeology of the intertidal wetlands of the Humber Estuary is of international importance, and includes prehistoric boats, trackways, fishtraps and platforms, Roman settlements and ports and Post-Medieval fishweirs.\\" The foreshore of North Ferriby, within the Humber Estuary, is the site of the earliest sewn plank boats known outside Egypt. In 1931, wooden planks belonging to an ancient boat were discovered by local man Ted Wright on the shore of the Humber. Two further boats have since been discovered. Estimates using radiocarbon dating have placed the origin of the boats to the Bronze Age, between 2030 and 1680 BC. The Ferriby Boats are the earliest known boats found in Europe. In addition, Bronze Age round barrows were found near North Ferriby by archaeologists excavating the land on which the A63 junction was built. There was also evidence of Iron Age and early Romano-British activity in that area. All Saints' Church The first wave of Danes arrived in the area around 900 AD with each ship setting up a local village. Amongst these was what is now North Ferriby from the Danish Ferja bi (place by a ferry), which would have been the chief Danish settlement of the area and linked by ferry to South Ferriby. A wooden church was built at that time, replaced by its first stone church . =Ferriby Priory= The village was once significant for Ferriby Priory, , of the order of knights templar, founded by Lord Eustace Broomfleet de Vesci, in the reign of King John, anno 1200, as appears from an ancient manuscript formerly in the possession of the late Luke Lillingston, Esq. of North Ferriby, the Owner of the priory. It was dissolved along with the lesser monasteries, in 1536. The site of this priory is said to have been in the possession of 100 different persons \\"in the space of no more than 130 years after its dissolution\\". The village has, in succession, been the patrimonial possession of the Mortimers, the Poles and the Bacons. It retains the elements of several elegant mansions from as Hull merchants started to build large houses (such as Ferriby House) with cottages for workers. Geography North Ferriby is on the north bank of the Humber Estuary, approximately west of Hull city centre. To the north, atop a hill, lies Swanland via the B1231. South Ferriby is directly opposite the village, on the south bank of the Humber. North Ferriby is generally referred to as \\"Ferriby\\" by locals on the north bank, except where confusion might arise. Melton is close by to the west which is where the large South Hunsley School is. North Ferriby lies in the Parliamentary constituency of Haltemprice and Howden. Community Ferriby parish had a population of 3,893, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 3,819 according to the 2011 UK census. The school has approximately 300 pupils. In the village is the Duke of Cumberland public house, a British Legion club, an Italian restaurant,Medici a pizza takeaway, a newsagent, chemist, estate agents, a squash club with three courts, village hall, parish hall and three hairdressers. North Ferriby's main shop is a Co- operative Group convenience store. North Ferriby was home to local artist Tom Harland. The village Riding for Disabled Association (RDA) is run throughout the year with the help of volunteers. North Ferriby United v FC United The local football club, North Ferriby United A.F.C., played in the National League North. They won the 2014‚Äì15 FA Trophy after beating Conference Premier side Wrexham at Wembley Stadium on 29 March 2015. However were wound up by the High Court on 15 March 2019 due to outstanding debts of almost ¬£10,000. A new club, North Ferriby F.C., was formed and play in the Northern Counties East League Division One. There also the Anne Turner allotments and playing fields, home of North Ferriby Cricket Club. There are also three tennis courts and a newly built skate park. A public footpath that forms part of the Trans Pennine Trail and the Yorkshire Wolds Way, runs from Ferriby to Hessle alongside the River Humber, with views of the Humber Bridge. On this path is the site where the Ferriby boats were found. The village no longer has a police house; the nearest police stations are in Brough and Hessle. With the backing of the Parish Council, the Twinning Association was formed in the spring of 2003 and links North Ferriby with Le Pellerin, a French village to the south of Brittany, on the estuary of France's longest river, the Loire. The village church has a distinctive spire, designed by John Loughborough Pearson, R.A. (1817‚Äì97), and was completed in 1848. The church dedicated to All Saints' was designated a Grade II listed building in 1968 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. The current vicar is Reverend Matthew Brailsford. The parish used to have extensive holdings, including Holy Trinity church in Hull. Transport The village is served by the main A63 road, being bypassed in 1961, which links to the M62 motorway to the west and Hull to the east. The former A63 is now the B1231. Access to the village is from the new grade separated junction that was fully completed in early 2007. North Ferriby Station The village is served by Ferriby railway station which is on the Selby Line. To get to places further away users must change at another railway station, the most commonly used is Brough to the west. The Yorkshire Wolds Way National Trail and the Trans Pennine Trail long distance footpaths pass through the village.

This section of road used to be the B4192 until the late 1970s when it was upgraded to A road status. At Kidderminster, it starts again and then runs north-north-west into Shropshire, via Bridgnorth and Telford (where it crosses the M54 motorway). Through Telford it is known as Queensway, and the Eastern Primary (EP). It ends where it meets the A53 just outside the village of Hodnet. Before the A53 bypass around the village was built, the A442 continued through Hodnet and joined the A41 near Darliston, south of Whitchurch. This section of road however has now been downgraded: most of it is declassified, but part has been reclassified as part of B5065. However Googlemaps.com is currently still mistakenly listing the now declassified route as still being the A442.http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&expIds;=25657,26714,26805&xhr;=t&cp;=5&client;=firefox-a&hs;=O6S&rls;=org.mozilla:en- GB:official&um;=1&ie;=UTF-8&q;=hodnet+hall&fb;=1‚â∑=uk&hq;=hodnet+hall&hnear;=hodnet+hall&cid;=0,0,7498207560301133979&ei;=YWCsTMvuOs- Kswbi8qylBA&sa;=X&oi;=local_result&ct;=image&resnum;=2&sqi;=2&ved;=0CB0QnwIwAQ History From Droitwich to Low Hill (south of Kidderminster) the road is probably ancient, as it is referred to in the Saxon charter for Whitlinge (in Hartlebury) dated AD 980 as a str√¶te.P. W. King, 'Some roads out of north Worcestershire' Transactions of Worcestershire Archaeological Society 3rd ser. 20 (2006), 90-1. This road was maintained by a Droitwich turnpike trust established in 1755.Statute 26 Geo. II, c.48. North of Kidderminster it was a 'way' in the Saxon bounds of Wolverley before being joined by the great street at Shatterford. At Shatterford, the Prior of Worcester was authorised to assart (ie to clear) of wood and heath \\"for the greater security of persons going through the said pass\\". From Shatterford the old course of the road goes through Romsley and Allum Bridge, to rejoin the present road at Quatt. The old survives as lane and tracks. The present road began life as a new turnpike built in the late 1820s by the Kidderminster turnpike trust, which had been responsible for the road as far as Quatford since 1760. Bridgnorth only became the northern end of the road in 1821.P. W. King, 95-8; Statutes, 33 Geo. II, c.50 and 1&2 GEo. IV, c.91. The trust remained responsible for the road until 1873.B. Trinder, Industrial Archaeology of Shropshire (1996), 255. North of Bridgnorth, the road formed part of the Stafford and Newport turnpikes. The Trust was established in 1763,Statute, 3 Geo. III, c.59. becoming their third district, when their Act was renewed in 1783. Beyond Sutton Cross in Sutton Maddock the turnpike continued through Shifnal to Woodcote, where it joined another turnpike (now the A41 road).Statute, 6 Geo. IV, c.8. This continuation is now classified as the B4379 and the A4169 road. The stretch immediately beyond Sutton Cross was part of the Madeley turnpike district, going to the Bucks Head on Watling Street. This was turnpiked in 1764, continuing southeast to the New Inn on Rudge Heath, but that stretch of road was evidently not improved until the 1960s, when it was upgraded to become the B4176. The northern terminus was altered in 1827 when the road from Balls Hill in Dawley to Bucks Head was discontinued in favour of an alternative route to Watling Street.Statutes, 4 Geo. III, c.81; 7&8 Geo. IV, c.15; King, 90; Trinder, 256. The course of the road was altered again when a new major road was built to take traffic through the built up area of Telford New Town in the 1970s. Some of the old routes have completely disappeared. The next section of the old route is from Watling Street to the smithy at Crudgington. The first part of this is now the A5223 road, but the new course of A442 then rejoins the old one. This was turnpiked in 1725 with the Shrewsbury to Crackley Bank section of Watling Street.Statute, 12 Geo. I, c.9; Trinder, 252. Further sections of the road are also former turnpikes.

As Illinois Comptroller Hynes was first elected Illinois Comptroller on November 3, 1998, at the age of 30. At the time, he was the youngest elected statewide constitutional officer in Illinois, since William Stratton was elected Treasurer of Illinois in 1942. Since first entering office in 1999, he was the first Comptroller to establish a \\"Rainy Day Fund\\" for Illinois as a way to secure funding for the state whenever there is a slowdown in revenue. Hynes also spearheaded bipartisan reform of laws governing the state's private cemeteries and funeral homes (which his office regulates) in 2001, the most extensive overhaul of these industries in 25 years. Dan Hynes has sponsored new legislation that prohibited tax scofflaws from receiving state contracts. He also introduced legislation in 2003, that would do the same to corporations that have falsified their financial reports. Among his other measures as Comptroller, was to reform the Local Government Division of his office, increasing the percentage of compliance from Illinois's local government units in financial reporting from 65 to 95 percent. Hynes also expanded the office's commercial direct deposit program, encouraging state vendors to receive payments electronically, which saves taxpayer money and improves efficiency. Daniel Hynes was elected to a second term as Comptroller on November 5, 2002, with a margin of more than one million votes. He was elected to a third term in 2006, by a similarly large margin.

Biography Patriarch Theophilos III of Jerusalem in the Senate of the Republic of Poland (2010). President George W. Bush listens as Theophilos III, Patriarch of Jerusalem, speaks during a visit to the Church of Nativity Thursday, January 10, 2008, in Bethlehem. Theophilos was born Ilias Giannopoulos in Gargalianoi, Messenia, Greece on 4 April 1952 to parents Panagiotes and Triseugenia. In 1964, Ilias moved to Jerusalem. He served as archdeacon for then-patriarch Benedict I of Jerusalem. From 1991 to 1996, he was a priest in Kafr Kanna in Galilee, which had a predominantly Israeli Arab Christian community, there he also formed a society called \\"Nour al Masih\\" (\\"Light of Christ\\") to spread the Orthodox Christian faith throughout the region. Theophilos studied theology at the University of Athens. He went on to complete an MA from Durham University, graduating in 1984 as a member of Castle. He has studied at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Besides his native Greek, he also speaks English, Arabic and Hebrew. In 1996, he was one of the first Christian clergymen in centuries to make an opening into the closed Wahhabi Islamic society of Qatar, an area historically under the jurisdiction of the Orthodox Church of Jerusalem where many Palestinian Arab migrant workers live today, a considerable number of them Orthodox Christians. He subsequently served as Exarch of the Holy Sepulchre in Qatar. From 2000 to 2003, he was church envoy to the Patriarchate of Moscow but mostly steered clear of Moscow, where the Patriarchate has an established metochion. Before becoming patriarch, Theophilos served for a short time as the Archbishop of Tabor, consecrated to the episcopacy by Irenaios in February 2005. He was officially enthroned as Patriarch of Jerusalem and All Palestine on November 22, 2005. Delegates from all of the Orthodox Churches as well as high secular dignitaries were in attendance, including the President of Greece, and senior officials representing the governments of Palestinian National Authority, Jordan and Qatar, as well as diplomats and military officials.

Moore published the poem in 1830 as part of Letters and Journals of Lord Byron. It evocatively describes what the youth at that time wanted to do something different. Byron wrote the poem at the age of twenty-nine. In the letter to Thomas Moore, the poem is preceded by an account of its genesis. \\"At present, I am on the invalid regimen myself. The Carnival--that is, the latter part of it, and sitting up late o' nights--had knocked me up a little. But it is over--and it is now Lent, with all its abstinence and sacred music... Though I did not dissipate much upon the whole, yet I find 'the sword wearing out the scabbard,' though I have just turned the corner of twenty-nine.\\" The poem may have been suggested in part by the refrain of a Scottish song known as \\"The Jolly Beggar.\\" The Jolly Beggar was published in Herd's Scottish Songs in 1776, decades before Byron's letter, with this refrain: The poem appears as \\"Go No More A-Roving\\" on the 2004 Leonard Cohen album, Dear Heather. It has been recorded by Ariella Uliano on her 2009 album 'A.U. (almost) a Compilation'. It was also recorded by Joan Baez on her 1964 Joan Baez/5 album, and by Mike Westbrook on his 1998 The Orchestra of Smith's Academy album. Richard Dyer-Bennet recorded his own setting, with slightly altered text, on the 1955 album \\"Richard Dyer-Bennet 1\\". The poem is also a centerpiece of \\"...And The Moon Be Still As Bright\\" from Ray Bradbury's novel, The Martian Chronicles. The poem serves as a basis for the chorus of the song \\"The Jolly Beggar\\" as recorded by the traditional Irish band Planxty, as well as the basis for the love leitmotif in Patrick Doyle's score for the film Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where it is fully realized in the track, \\"The Wedding Night\\". The poem is also featured in John Wyndham's post-apocalyptic novel, The Day of the Triffids, where it occurs when a blinded pianist commits suicide. The first line is a sub theme to the Dark Autumn episode of Midsomer Murders.

Background Kent Cooper was born on March 22, 1880, in Columbus, Indiana; his father was Democratic U.S. Congressman George W. Cooper. Career His father's early death led Cooper to turn his after-school job as reporter for a local newspaper into a full-time job. He became a reporter for the Indianapolis Press newspaper. He joined the Scripps-McRae Press Association (later United Press), established his own news agency, and then returned to Scripps-McRae in a buy-out. In 1910, Melville Stone, editor of the Associated Press, hired him as traveling inspector. In 1912, he was promoted to chief of traffic. In 1920, he was promoted to assistant general manager. In 1920, he became general manager. In the late 1920s, Cooper hired AP's first class of women reporters, including Marguerite Young, who later, as Washington bureau chief for the Daily Worker, would introduce Soviet spy Hede Massing to American diplomat Noel Field. Innovations introduced under his stewardship include use of the first high-speed telegraph printing machines, use of teletype (instead of Morse Code), and introduction of a photograph wire service (by 1935, known as World Wide Photos). By 1929, he had also opened bureaus in London, Paris, and Berlin. During his 41 years with AP, Cooper's positions included general manager (1925‚Äì1943) and finally executive director.

Produced from 1946 to 1968, the Mercury M series was sold primarily in Canada, as a rebadged version of the Ford F series.  Background  In 1946, Ford of Canada split its Ford and Lincoln/Mercury divisions into separate sales networks. Alongside the creation of the Monarch and Meteor sub-brands, Ford of Canada introduced trucks to the Mercury division. At the time, few rural communities offered both the Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealership networks, miniminizing model overlap and allowing for greater coverage for potential truck buyers. To differentiate Ford and Mercury trucks, Mercury added a brand-specific grille and slightly different exterior and interior trim.  Nomenclature  In 1948, following the introduction of the Ford F series, Mercury adopted the use of the \\"M\\" prefix, for Mercury. From 1948 to 1950, nominal tonnage ratings were replaced by a series designation in which the numbers indicate the GVWR when equipped with tires of appropriate capacity. Each code number is arrived at by dividing the GVWR of the series by 100. Thus an F-47 (M-47) indicates a GVWR of 4700 lbs., F-135 (M-135) indicates 13500 lbs., etc. In 1951‚Äì52, Ford of Canada got back in step with Ford USA with F-1 (M-1), F-2 (M-2) etc.  Pickup trucks  1949 Mercury M series left From 1948 to 1968, the Mercury M series followed the development of its Ford F-series counterparts, differing largely in exterior trim. For 1961 to 1966, Mercury trucks had a gear/lightning bolt symbol on their horn button and no other interior Mercury nameplates. For 1967 and 1968, trucks used Ford interior trim only, such as the horn button, dash cluster bezel and radio block-off plate. Other Mercury trucks 1964 Mercury M700 flatbed towtruck 1964 Mercury Econoline EM-100 pickup Alongside the M-Series pickup trucks, Mercury dealerships in Canada rebadged other versions of the Ford truck range. Along with an M-series counterpart of medium-duty F-series trucks (F-500 and above), Mercury sold its own versions of the Ford B-series bus chassis and Ford C-series tilt-cab truck. In a similar fashion, the Ford Econoline van and pickup truck was sold as a Mercury from 1961 to 1967. While not specifically sold as a Mercury, the 1957‚Äì1959 Ford Ranchero was rebadged and sold by the Meteor division in Canada (through the Lincoln-Mercury dealership network)  Discontinuation  1968 Mercury M100, final year of production When the Auto-Pact was signed in 1965, opening the border to tariff-free movement of vehicles produced on both sides of the border, Mercury truck production was split between the Oakville, Ontario, plant and the San Jose, California, plant. This enabled Oakville to ramp up production to supply the eastern US and Canada with Ford trucks. No Mercury trucks were sold in the US. Ford wound down production of the Mercury trucks in the late spring of 1968; documented Mercury trucks have been found built as late as May 15, 1968. Employees of Ford in this time period have reported leftover Mercury M series being converted to Ford trucks. However, no paperwork or confirmation has yet surfaced regarding the final disposition of these, nor of an official end date to production. Following the discontinuation of the Mercury M-series pickup, the M-series tilt-cab version of the C series survived until 1972. After its discontinuation, the next Mercury light truck would be the 1993 Mercury Villager minivan.

Legislative history The RAVE Act was originally sponsored by Senator Joseph Biden, who was also the writer of the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act. Biden attached the legislation as a rider to the bill creating the popular AMBER Alert system. Purpose The act authorized funds to educate parents and minors on the dangers of Ecstasy and other drugs.

The law made it illegal for people to knowingly open, lease, rent, or maintain ‚àí whether permanently or temporarily ‚àí any place for the purpose of using, distributing or manufacturing any controlled substance. It also made it unlawful for a manager, employee or owner, to profit from, or make available for use, any place for the purpose of storing, distributing, manufacturing, or using a controlled substance.

The league had originally targeted eight teams and considered 10-12 potential sites, they were Chico; Fresno; Henderson, Nevada; Lodi; Long Beach; Merced; Oceanside; Oxnard; Palm Springs; Redding; Rohnert Park; Sacramento; San Luis Obispo; Santa Barbara; St. George, Utah; Yuba City; and Yuma, Arizona. However, it eventually started play with only four teams. These were the Imperial Valley Brahmas in Brawley, California and El Centro, California; the Antelope Valley Ravens in Lancaster, California and Palmdale, California; the Yuma Desert Dawgs moved to the Western Baseball League the following year (1996); and a traveling team, the Sierra Nevada/Southern Nomadic Miners, represented both Bishop, California (Sierra Nevada), and the Palm Springs area (Southern Nomadic). One team was supposed to play in Indio, California as the Indio Lil' Devils, but the city lacked a standard ball park and the team's operations had moved to Yuma. Another failed team, the San Luis Obispo Knights in Paso Robles, California, never surfaced. Planning for the league started in 1993. Golden State immediately faced obstacles in securing municipal financing, ballparks, and subsidies for new teams, as well as entrenched competition from the California League. Plagued by financial difficulties, the season opener was postponed several times from the original target date of March 31, 1995. The league folded just one week after its opening game held on June 16, 1995 in Yuma. The Ravens continued to play as a member of the later-folded Southwest Baseball League with teams in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah with the rest of home games in the Speedway Ballpark in Rosamond, California. Like most independent leagues, Golden State rosters included a mix of high school and college stars and big leaguers looking to extend their careers. Ex-major leaguers associated with Golden State included pitcher Scott Taylor (Antelope Valley), formerly of the Red Sox, and Gold Glove and all-star outfielder Ellis Valentine (manager Antelope Valley).

The book is set in a world of antiquarian booksellers, echoing his previous 1990 work, The Flanders Panel. The story follows the adventures of a book dealer, Lucas Corso, who is hired to authenticate a rare manuscript by Alexandre Dumas, p√®re. Corso's investigation leads him to seek out two copies of a (fictional) rare book known as De Umbrarum Regni Novem Portis (\\"Of the Nine Doors of the Kingdom of Shadows\\"). Corso encounters a host of intriguing characters on his journey of investigation, including devil worshippers, obsessed bibliophiles and a hypnotically enticing femme fatale. Corso's travels take him to Madrid (Spain), Sintra (Portugal), Paris (France) and Toledo (Spain). The Club Dumas is full of details ranging from the working habits of Alexandre Dumas to how one might forge a 17th-century text, as well as insight into demonology. Plot summary Lucas Corso is a middle-aged book dealer with a reputation of doing anything‚Äîregardless of legality‚Äîfor his privileged clientele. While in Madrid attempting to authenticate a previously unknown partial draft of The Three Musketeers, he is summoned to Toledo by Varo Borja, a notoriously eccentric and wealthy collector. Borja has obtained a copy of a legendary book, Of the Nine Doors of the Kingdom of Shadows, whose author was burned at the stake by the Inquisition. The book purportedly contains instructions for summoning the Devil. Only one copy of the book is supposed to have survived, but Borja claims three exist, two of which are elaborate forgeries. He hires Corso to compare the three copies and obtain the legitimate one by any means necessary. He promises to pay handsomely and cover all expenses. Corso agrees, but continues to research the partial Dumas draft. The widow of the draft's previous owner, Liana Taillefer, insists the draft is a fake, but offers to buy it from Corso. After several encounters, she attempts to seduce Corso to obtain the draft; when he succumbs to her charms but refuses to surrender the manuscript, she becomes his enemy. She imagines herself as Milady de Winter, and uses a male associate (whom Corso nicknames \\"Rochefort\\") to follow Corso and attempt to retrieve the manuscript by force. Corso confers with the Ceniza Brothers, book restoration experts with extensive knowledge of forgery. They give him basic knowledge to help him compare the copies of The Nine Doors. On his way to Lisbon to visit the owner of one of the copies, he encounters a beautiful blonde with striking green eyes. She identifies herself as \\"Irene Adler\\", and suggests that she is a fallen angel. They part company before he meets with Victor Fargas. Fargas is a renowned collector who has been selling off his extensive library to maintain his ancestral mansion. Corso compares Fargas' copy of The Nine Doors to Borja's, and finds subtle differences in the illustration plates. Most bear the initials of the book's notorious author, but some of the plates bear the initials \\"L.F.\\" As Corso returns to his hotel, \\"Irene\\" guards Corso against an attack by \\"Rochefort\\". Corso leaves her to arrange a robbery of Fargas' mansion to obtain his copy of the book. \\"Irene\\" calls him to announce that Fargas has been murdered and his copy has been burned. She and Corso leave for Paris. Corso confers with Replinger, an antiquarian and Dumas scholar, who authenticates the Dumas manuscript. As they talk, Corso spies Liana. He returns to his hotel and bribes the concierge to locate her hotel. \\"Irene\\" visits him, and they discuss theology; she implies that she is a witness to the events of the War in Heaven. Corso visits Baroness Ungern, whose charitable institution possesses the largest occult collection in Europe, including the third copy of The Nine Doors. They discuss the book's author, before Corso blackmails her with photo evidence of her Nazi sympathies so she will let him examine her copy. \\"Irene\\" calls to warn Corso that \\"Rochefort\\" is waiting outside. The Baroness translates the illustration captions while Corso compares Ungern's copy to Borja's. Later, Corso realizes that, while none of the three sets match each other, the plates bearing the initials \\"L.F.\\" form a complete set of nine without duplications, and realizes the nine illustrations form a list of instructions for the famed summoning ritual. \\"Rochefort\\" attacks again, and is again repelled by \\"Irene\\". Using the concierge's information, Corso confronts Liana and her associate, but \\"Rochefort\\" renders him unconscious. When he revives, Borja's copy and the Dumas manuscript are gone. He learns that the Baroness has been killed in a fire at her library. Using Liana's obsession with Milady de Winter, he traces her to Meung, where he is captured by \\"Rochefort\\". \\"Rochefort\\" is instructed by a man calling himself \\"Richelieu\\" to bring Corso to a nearby castle. \\"Richelieu\\" introduces him to the Club Dumas, a literary society of wealthy Dumas enthusiasts, who are gathered for their annual banquet. Corso is astonished to find that they only want to see the Dumas manuscript, and know nothing about The Nine Doors. He is invited to stay for the party, but chooses to leave. Corso returns to Spain to confront Borja. \\"Irene\\" insists that she is a fallen angel who has wandered the earth for millennia searching for him. Corso does not question this, and finds himself even more strongly attracted to her. He accuses Borja of being responsible for both murders. Borja, intending to use the ritual described by the book's true nine plates to summon the Devil and gain ultimate knowledge, has destroyed his entire library to prevent others from following his lead. Corso demands payment, but Borja ignores him and begins the ritual. Corso leaves in disgust; as he leaves, he hears Borja's screams of anguish as the ritual goes awry, remembering the Ceniza Brothers' discourse on false books and realizing one of the plates is a forgery. He joins \\"Irene\\" outside, and surmises that each of them will get the devil they deserve. Literary references The Club Dumas references many books. Several of the references are not to a work itself, but to a singular instance of the physical book, such as a rare edition or type of binding.

The fictional character Torchia was born in 1620. He was apprenticed in Leyden under the Elzevir family. After returning to Venice he published small works on philosophical and esoteric themes. In 1666, Torchia published De Umbrarum Regni Novem Portis (The Nine Doors to the Kingdom of Shadows), which was in turn based on the Delomelanicon, or Invocation of Darkness, a work supposedly written by Lucifer and that would allow the reader to summon devils. The Inquisition condemned Torchia for magic and witchcraft and burned him at the stake in 1667. Film adaptation Roman Polanski's film The Ninth Gate (1999) was adapted from P√©rez-Reverte's novel. While following the same basic plotline for the first two-thirds of the film, the finale is greatly altered in the movie.

He also held the posts of Commander-in-Chief of the Defense of the North, and Governor of Mutsu Province. His father was Imperial advisor Kitabatake Chikafusa.  Biography  In 1333, Akiie was ordered to accompany the six-year-old eighth son of Emperor Go-Daigo, Prince Norinaga (also read as Noriyoshi), to Mutsu, where the Prince became Governor- General of Mutsu and Dewa. These two large provinces constituted much of the north-eastern end of Honsh≈´, the area now known as T≈çhoku. In April 1333, he was appointed to the post of Chinjufu-sh≈çgun, or Commander-in-Chief of the Defense of the North. This was a position that had been held by Minamoto no Yoshiie two hundred years earlier. A number of families formed a league under his direction, supporting the Southern Court; these included the samurai families of Y≈´ki, Date, Nambu, Soma, and Tamura. The Soma and several other daimy≈ç were convinced to change sides by Takauji, however. Three years later, he led an army nominally under the command of Norinaga to the outskirts of Kyoto to reinforce the forces of Nitta Yoshisada against Ashikaga Takauji. Nitta and Kitabatake were aided by warrior monks from Enryakuji, and the temple of Miidera, whose monks supported Ashikaga Takauji, was burned to the ground. Traveling to Ky≈´sh≈´, Kitabatake gathered support for the Southern Court in the absence of Ashikaga Takauji, one of the strongest leaders of the Northern Court. In 1337, despite facing opposition at home in the north, Kitabatake was ordered by Emperor Go-Daigo to come to the aid of his army to the south of Kyoto. Kitabatake led his forces slowly south, fighting the Northern Court in many battles. He was defeated at the Tone River before pushing south and occupying Kamakura, the capital of the Ashikaga shogunate, and making his way to Nara, fighting at Iga and Sekigahara. In Nara, while trying to rest and reorganize his forces, he was set upon by K≈ç no Moronao and barely escaped to Kawachi Province. He recouped and pushed through enemy forces at Tenn≈çji (near modern-day Osaka), but was eventually defeated and killed at Izumi in 1338 at the age of twenty-one. His death is described in the epic Taiheiki and in his father's Jinn≈ç Sh≈çt≈çki.

It is believed to be a 1769 Short Land Pattern, and is loaded with buck and ball. Buckshot pellets from the American Civil War Buck and ball was a common load for muzzle-loading muskets, and was frequently used in the American Revolutionary War and into the early days of the American Civil War. The load usually consisted of a .50 to .75 caliber round lead musket ball (.69 caliber for the \\"Brown Bess\\" musket) that was combined with three to six buckshot pellets.  Construction  Buck and ball was issued in paper cartridges that combined the projectiles with the black powder propellant charge to facilitate rapid loading of the weapon. Like any other paper cartridge, the rear of the cartridge would be torn open to expose the powder, which would be loaded, and the remaining paper, ball, and buckshot would be rammed down on top.  Purpose  The intent of the buck and ball load was to combine the devastating impact of a .50 to .75 caliber ball with the spreading pattern of a shotgun. The combination served to greatly improve the hit probability of the smoothbore musket. In combat, especially at closer ranges, the buckshot would retain significant energy. When used against closely packed troops, the spread of the buckshot would be advantageous. Claud E. Fuller, in his book The Rifled Musket, shows tests of a rifled musket firing Mini√© ball, and a smoothbore musket firing round ball and buck rounds at various ranges against a target. The firers consisted of several men in line shooting in volley. At ranges of and under, the buck and ball from the smoothbore musket, while less accurate than the rifled musket, produces a greater number of hits due to the greater number of projectiles. At , 50 shots by smoothbore buck and ball against the 10 x 10 target result in 79 buckshot hits and 37 ball strikes, as opposed to 48 Mini√© ball hits in 50 shots. At 200 yards, 37 of 50 Mini√© bullets struck the target, vs. 18 of 50 smoothbore balls and 31 of 50 buckshot, for a total of 49 hits in 50 shots. Beyond this range, the buckshot will have lost too much energy to be effective due to its lower ballistic coefficient.  Use  Perhaps the most famous proponent of the buck and ball loading was George Washington, who encouraged his troops to load their muskets with buck and ball loads during the American Revolution. The buck and ball load was standard issue throughout the Seminole Wars of 1815‚Äì45. With the advent of general issue rifled muskets in the American Civil War, and longer engagement ranges during the later stages of the war, the buck and ball loading began to fade from use. Buck and ball did see action in the remaining inventory of smoothbore muskets at Gettysburg and later actions. The Union Irish Brigade retained their smoothbore muskets until late so they could fire buck and ball during the relatively close range battles, perhaps most famously, and to good effect, against Pickett's Charge. In addition, the 12th New Jersey Infantry preferred to use buck and ball, which they did to deadly effect at Gettysburg, and so continued carrying smoothbore muskets. For the modern combat shotgun the buck and ball load has been replaced in current military inventories by standard buckshot loadings. Modern resurgence Modern ammunition manufacturers have recently re-discovered Buck and Ball type shotgun loads, and have been manufacturing defensive shotgun ammunition which largely duplicates the properties of the historical loads. As an example Winchester's PDX1 12 gauge load features three 00-buck copper plated pellets over a one-ounce slug. Similar ammunition is produced by Centurion, called \\"Multi Defense Buckshot.\\"  See also  * Mini√© ball * Muzzleloader References  Further reading  * The Rifle-Musket vs. The Smoothbore Musket, a Comparison of the Effectiveness of the Two Types of Weapons Primarily at Short Ranges * Ordnance manual for the use of the officers of the United States army (1862), page 270 Category:Ammunition Category:American Civil War weapons ","title":"Buck and ball"},{"id":"2516965","text":"Aerial view of City Hill and the Vernon Circle. City Hill is a park located in Canberra, Australia on one of the points of the Parliamentary Triangle, a feature of Walter Burley Griffin's plan for the city. The park is surrounded by Vernon Circle, at the south end of Northbourne Avenue, but beyond Vernon Circle it is further surrounded by the concentric London Circuit, and the area between Vernon Circle and London Circuit (which is partly built up) can also be seen as part of the hill. City Hill is an integral part of the city centre design. To the south of the hill Northbourne Avenue becomes Commonwealth Avenue, and further along is Commonwealth Avenue bridge. The hill was planted in 1921. The design, supervised by Charles Weston, Canberra's first Superintendent of Parks and Gardens, was to emphasise the vistas along the six avenues radiating from the hill and reinforce the focus that Griffin placed on the hill as forming part of the Parliamentary triangle. At the centre of the hill is a flagpole flying the ACT flag since 1989 when the territory became self-governing. Immediately surrounding the flagpole are double staggered rows of closely spaced Roman cypresses (Cupressus sempervirens Stricta). Radiating outwards are twelve oval shaped groups of Roman cypresses and six groups of Monterey pines (Pinus radiata) reinforcing the symmetrical nature of the design. In 2014 the Canberra Centenary Column was added to the park, to commemorate Canberra's centenary. The park is centrally located and well- known, but it is rarely visited as it is away from shops and public areas and is difficult to access because it is surrounded by a major road. The prominent flagpole at the centre of Vernon Circle is not actually at the highest point of City Hill. The highest point of City Hill is to the south east, overlooking Lake Burley Griffin. Unusually for the centre of a large city and as a result of the relative isolation of City Hill, a small variety of mushrooms can be found growing under the pine trees.

The method exploits luminescence emitted by phosphor material. Phosphors are fine white or pastel-colored inorganic powders which may be stimulated by any of a variety of means to luminesce, i.e. emit light. Certain characteristics of the emitted light change with temperature, including brightness, color, and afterglow duration. The latter is most commonly used for temperature measurement. Time dependence of luminescence Phase difference between LED output and luminescence. Typically a short duration ultraviolet lamp or laser source illuminates the phosphor coating which in turn luminesces visibly. When the illuminating source ceases, the luminescence will persist for a characteristic time, steadily decreasing. The time required for the brightness to decrease to 1/e of its original value is known as the decay time or lifetime and signified as \\\\tau. It is a function of temperature, T. The intensity, I of the luminescence commonly decays exponentially as: !\\\\, I=I_{o}e^{\\\\frac{-t}{\\\\tau}} Where I0 is the initial intensity (or amplitude). A temperature sensor based on direct decay time measurement has been shown to reach a temperature as high as 1,600 ¬∞C.J.L. Kennedy and N. Djeu (2002), \\"Operation of Yb:YAG fiber optic temperature sensor up to 1,600¬∞C\\", Sensors and Actuators A _100_ , 187-191. In that work, a doped YAG phosphor was grown onto an undoped YAG fiber to form a monolithic structure for the probe, and a laser was used as the excitation source. Subsequently, other versions using LEDs as the excitation source were realized. These devices can measure temperature up to 1,000 ¬∞C, and are used in microwave and plasma processing applications.Commercialized by MicroMaterials, Inc. under US Patents 6,045,259 and 9,599,518 B2. If the excitation source is periodic rather than pulsed, then the time response of the luminescence is correspondingly different. For instance, there is a phase difference between a sinusoidally varying light emitting diode (LED) signal of frequency f and the fluorescence that results (see figure). The phase difference varies with decay time and hence temperature as: !\\\\, \\\\phi=tan(2 {\\\\pi} f {\\\\tau}) Temperature dependence of emission lines: intensity ratio The second method of temperature detection is based on intensity ratios of two separate emission lines; the change in coating temperature is reflected by the change of the phosphorescence spectrum. This method enables surface temperature distributions to be measured. The intensity ratio method has the advantage that polluted optics has little effect on the measurement as it compares ratios between emission lines. The emission lines are equally affected by 'dirty' surfaces or optics. Temperature dependence Several observations are pertinent to the figure on the right: *Oxysulfide materials exhibit several different emission lines, each having a different temperature dependence. Substituting one rare-earth for another, in this instance changing La to Gd, shifts the temperature dependence. *The YAG:Cr material (Y3Al5O12:Cr3+) shows less sensitivity but covers a wider temperature range than the more sensitive materials. *Sometime decay times are constant over a wide range before becoming temperature dependent at some threshold value. This is illustrated for the YVO4:Dy curve; it also holds for several other materials (not shown in the figure). Manufacturers sometimes add a second rare earth as a sensitizer. This may enhance the emission and alter the nature of the temperature dependence. Also, gallium is sometimes substituted for some of the aluminium in YAG, also altering the temperature dependence. *The emission decay of dysprosium (Dy) phosphors is sometimes non-exponential with time. Consequently, the value assigned to decay time will depend on the analysis method chosen. This non- exponential character often becomes more pronounced as the dopant concentration increases. *In the high-temperature part, the two lutetium phosphate samples are single crystals rather than powders. This has minor effect on decay time and its temperature dependence though. However, the decay time of a given phosphor depends on the particle size, especially below one micrometer. There are further parameters influencing the luminescence of thermographic phosphors, e.g. the excitation energy, the dopant concentration or the composition or the absolute pressure of the surrounding gas phase. Therefore, care has to be taken in order to keep constant these parameters for all measurements. Thermographic phosphor application in a thermal barrier coating A thermal barrier coating (TBC) allows gas turbine components to survive higher temperatures in the hot section of engines, while having acceptable life times. These coatings are thin ceramic coatings (several hundred micrometers) usually based on oxide materials. Early works considered the integration of luminescent materials as erosion sensors in TBCs.K. Amano, H. Takeda, T. Suzuki, M. Tamatani, M. Itoh and Y. Takahashi (1987), \\"Thermal barrier coating\\" The notion of a \\"thermal barrier sensor coating\\" (sensor TBC) for temperature detection was introduced in 1998. Instead of applying a phosphor layer on the surface where the temperature needs to be measured, it was proposed to locally modify the composition of the TBC so that it acts as a thermographic phosphor as well as a protective thermal barrier. This dual functional material enables surface temperature measurement but also could provide a means to measure temperature within the TBC and at the metal/topcoat interface, hence enabling the manufacturing of an integrated heat flux gauge.K-L. Choy, A. L. Heyes and J. Feist (1998), \\"Thermal barrier coating with thermoluminescent indicator material embedded therein\\" First results on yttria-stabilized zirconia co-doped with europia (YSZ:Eu) powders were published in 2000. They also demonstrated sub-surface measurements looking through a 50 Œºm undoped YSZ layer and detecting the phosphorescence of a thin (10 ¬µm) YSZ:Eu layer (bi-layer system) underneath using the ESAVD technique to produce the coating. The first results on electron beam physical vapour deposition of TBCs were published in 2001. The coating tested was a monolayer coating of standard YSZ co-doped with dysprosia (YSZ:Dy). First work on industrial atmospheric plasma sprayed (APS) sensor coating systems commenced around 2002 and was published in 2005. They demonstrated the capabilities of APS sensor coatings for in-situ two-dimensional temperature measurements in burner rigs using a high speed camera system. Further, temperature measurement capabilities of APS sensor coatings were demonstrated beyond 1400 ¬∞C.J. P. Feist, J. R. Nicholls, M. J. Fraser, A. L. Heyes (2006) \\"Luminescent material compositions and structures incorporating the same\\" Patent PCT/GB2006/003177 Results on multilayer sensing TBCs, enabling simultaneous temperature measurements below and on the surface of the coating, were reported. Such a multilayer coating could also be used as a heat flux gauge in order to monitor the thermal gradient and also to determine the heat flux through the thickness of the TBC under realistic service conditions. Applications for thermographic phosphors in TBCs While the previously mentioned methods are focusing on the temperature detection, the inclusion of phosphorescent materials into the thermal barrier coating can also work as a micro probe to detect the aging mechanisms or changes to other physical parameters that affect the local atomic surroundings of the optical active ion.A.

He was born in S√§√§minki (now part of Savonlinna). His childhood was fatherless and poverty-stricken, his mother suffered from mental frailties and Joel himself was forced into paupery. Joel's foster mother supported his schooling and Lehtonen was able to study literature for a few years in the University of Helsinki, but dropped out without completing a degree. As an author, he began as a neoromanticist, but after the Finnish Civil War his outlook transformed into deep pessimism and disenchanted scepticism. Having suffered for years from various ailments, he committed suicide by hanging himself with a rope, that had been used to wrap up a parcel of books, in November 1934.

Biography =Early life= Hellinger was born into an Orthodox Jewish family Mildred \\"Millie\\" (nee Fitch) and Pol Hellinger in New York City, although in later life he became a non-practicing Jew. When he was fifteen, he organized a student strike at Townsend Harris High School and was expelled for his actions. This proved to be the end of his formal education.Mark Hellinger biodata at St. Bonaventure University's website In 1921, Hellinger began working as a waiter and cashier at a Greenwich Village night club in order to meet theatre people. He later was employed by Lane Bryant to write direct mail advertising for clothing for larger and pregnant women. =Journalist= The following year he began his journalistic career as a reporter for Zit's Weekly, a theatrical publication, where he remained for eighteen months. In 1923, Hellinger moved to the city desk of the New York Daily News. He wrote a play None Are So Blind (1923). =Short Story Writer= In July 1925, he was assigned About Town, a Sunday column his editors intended him to fill with news and gossip about Broadway theatre. Instead, he filled the space with short stories in the style of O. Henry. When his columns drew a considerable amount of fan mail, he was permitted to continue in this vein. Three years later he graduated to a daily feature called Behind the News. He numbered such personalities as Walter Winchell, Florenz Ziegfeld, Texas Guinan, Dutch Schultz, and Legs Diamond among his friends. In November 1929, Hellinger moved to the New York Daily Mirror. While continuing to write daily and Sunday columns, he contributed sketches to the Ziegfeld Follies, wrote plays, published magazine articles, produced two collections of short stories, Moon Over Broadway (1931) and The Ten Million (1934), and co-wrote the screenplay for Broadway Bill with Robert Riskin. Some films were based on his works including Justice for Sale (1932), the short I Know Everybody and Everybody's Racket (1934), Broadway Bill (1934), and Walking Down Broadway (1938). Hollywood =Writer= By 1937, Hellinger was a syndicated columnist featured in 174 newspapers. That same year he was hired as a writer/producer by Jack L. Warner. He worked on the story for Racket Busters (1938) and Comet Over Broadway (1938) and provided the story for the 1939 Jimmy Cagney/Raoul Walsh gangster film The Roaring Twenties, basing it on his own experiences during that decade. In his onscreen foreword to the film, he wrote: =Producer= Hellinger began worked as a producer on B pictures such as The Adventures of Jane Arden (1939), Women in the Wind (1939), Hell's Kitchen (1939) and The Cowboy Quarterback (1939). Hellinger also helped produce The Roaring Twenties (1939), his first \\"A\\" film. He produced Bs for a little bit longer: Kid Nightingale (1939), and British Intelligence (1940). Then Hellinger established himself as a top level producer with It All Came True (1940) starring Ann Sheridan. He followed it with Torrid Zone (1940) starring Cagney and Sheridan, and Brother Orchid (1940) with Edward G. Robinson, Bogart and Sheridan. Burial site of Mark and Gladys Hellinger Hellinger made two classics with Raoul Walsh: They Drive by Night (1940) with Bogart, Sheridan, George Raft and Ida Lupino; and High Sierra (1941) with Bogart and Lupino. He made a comedy, Affectionately Yours (1941) with Merle Oberon, then did a melodrama with Raft and Robinson, Manpower (1941). Hellinger went over to 20th Century Fox to make two films: Rise and Shine (1942), a musical, and Moontide (1942) with Lupino and Jean Gabin. Due to a congenital heart condition, Hellinger repeatedly was rejected for active service during World War II. Instead, he briefly worked as a war correspondent, writing human interest stories about the troops.Biographical sketch by Alan Rode Back at Warners, he produced the all-star musical revue Thank Your Lucky Stars (1943) and made Between Two Worlds (1944), The Doughgirls (1944), and The Horn Blows at Midnight (1945). =Universal= Hellinger set up at Universal, where he had his own producing unit. He had a big hit with The Killers (1946) which made a star of Burt Lancaster and Ava Gardner. He followed it with Swell Guy (1946) with Sonny Tufts, The Two Mrs. Carrolls (1947) with Bogart back at Warners,Brute Force, and The Naked City, which he also narrated. The film was released several weeks after Hellinger's death, and in his review for the New York Times, Bosley Crowther called it \\"a virtual Hellinger column on film\\" and \\"his appropriate valedictory\\" and observed, \\"The late Mark Hellinger's personal romance with the City of New York was one of the most ecstatic love affairs of the modern day ‚Äî at least, to his host of friends and readers who are skeptics regarding l'amour. Before he became a film producer and was still just a newspaper scribe, Mr. Hellinger went for Manhattan in a blissfully uninhibited way ‚Äî for its sights and sounds and restless movements, its bizarre people and its equally bizarre smells. And he made quite a local reputation framing his fancies in flowery billets doux which stirred the hearts and the humors of readers of the tabloid press.\\" New York Times, March 5, 1948 Hellinger won the 1947 Edgar Award for Best Motion Picture for The Killers. Personal life In 1926, Hellinger was one of the judges for a beauty contest sponsored by the Daily News. The winner was Ziegfeld showgirl Gladys Glad, and on July 11, 1929, the two were wed. She divorced him in 1932, but after a year the two remarried on the same date as their original wedding, and they remained wed until his death from a coronary thrombosis in Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles. He was buried in a private mausoleum at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York on Christmas Eve. Legacy In January 1949, the 51st Street Theatre in Manhattan was renamed the Mark Hellinger Theatre in his honor. In 1989 the venue was converted into the Times Square Church. The Hellinger Award annually acknowledges the accomplishments of St. Bonaventure University's most promising young journalism student. It was established in 1960 by columnist Jim Bishop in memory of his mentor. Bishop also wrote a biography of Hellinger entitled The Mark Hellinger Story: A Biography of Broadway and Hollywood.

Bisonalveus fossils have been discovered in the upper Great Plains region of North America, including sites in modern-day Wyoming, North Dakota, Montana, and Alberta. The fossils have been dated to 60 million years ago, during the Tiffanian North American Stage of the Palaeocene epoch. Bisonalveus is the last known genus of the Pentacodontinae sub-family to have arisen, replacing the genus Coriphagus in the early Tiffanian. Bisonalveus itself appears to have gone extinct by the middle Tiffanian. Bisonalveus is represented by two known species: B. browni (Gazin, 1956) and B. holtzmani (Gingerich, 1983). B. browni B. browni was discovered in 1956 from fossilized jaw fragments (including molars). Later discovered fossils included front teeth and a dagger-like canine tooth with an enameled groove. The canines do not have a corresponding surface on the lower jaw, indicating that they were not used for chewing, but rather for stabbing. That would mean Bisonalveus was a predator, presumably hunting small insects. The grooves on the canines may have been used for delivering venomous saliva into the prey, which would thereby make Bisonalveus one of the few known venomous mammals. Perhaps, like the modern solenodon, Bisonalveus bit its victims to inject its toxic saliva and buried the immobilized prey in a cache for later consumption. However, because several nonvenomous mammals (such as baboons and other primates) have similar grooves on their teeth, some scientists have questioned whether these grooves truly indicate venom delivery. If Bisonalveus was a forager, the grooves might have served the purpose of introducing (nonvenomous) saliva for digestive reasons. Alternatively, the grooves might have been useful as they increased the amount of enamel on the canines, thereby strengthening these slender teeth. B. holtzmani B. holtzmani is named for Dr. Richard Holtzman, who, in 1978, described the first tooth that was later determined to belong to this species. B. holtzmani can be distinguished from B. browni in that it is about 30% larger.

A declining number of scholars identify him with Kyot the Proven√ßal, the alleged writer of the source material used by Wolfram von Eschenbach for his romance Parzival, but most others consider such a source to be a literary device made up by Wolfram.Hatto, p. 427. At any rate, Guiot was a popular writer in his day. Life and career As a trouv√®re (the Northern French langue d'o√Øl version of troubadour), Guiot probably wrote dozens of songs, though only six survive, all from around 1180.\\"Troubadours, Trouv√®res and Minnesingers\\". Here Of A Sunday Morning. Retrieved April 25, 2006. He traveled widely, visiting Germany, Greece, Constantinople, and Jerusalem, and may have participated in the Third and perhaps Fourth Crusades. Guiot eventually joined a cloister as a Cluniac monk. He wrote two satirical works concerning morality, the more famous of which is La Bible Guiot (\\"Bible\\" here does not refer to the Holy Bible, but is a medieval French title meaning \\"satire\\"), which includes an early reference to the magnetic compass.Munro, John (2004). The Story of Electricity. Kessinger. .\\"The Story Of Electricity by John Munro\\" . lateralscience.co.uk. Retrieved April 25, 2006. As to Guiot's connection with Kyot the Proven√ßal, most scholars believe Wolfram was not being truthful (or even serious) in his account of a source for Parzival outside of Chr√©tien de Troyes's Perceval, the Story of the Grail. If this is so, then even had Wolfram intended for his character to be identified with the historical Guiot de Provins, he was attaching to him fictitious information. Conflated with Wolfram's Kyot, the poet appears as a companion of the title character in Umberto Eco's novel Baudolino, where he argues over the nature of the Holy Grail with Robert de Boron.Eco, Umberto (2003).

It joins the iliacus muscle to form the iliopsoas. In animals, this muscle is equivalent to the tenderloin. Its name derives from Greek œàœåŒ±œÇ, ps√≥ƒÅs, meaning 'of the loins' (genitive singular form of œàœåŒ±, ps√≥a: 'the loins'). Structure The psoas major is divided into a superficial and deep part. The deep part originates from the transverse processes of lumbar vertebrae I-V. The superficial part originates from the lateral surfaces of the last thoracic vertebra, lumbar vertebrae I-IV, and from the neighboring intervertebral discs. The lumbar plexus lies between the two layers. The iliacus and psoas major form the iliopsoas, which is surrounded by the iliac fascia. The iliopsoas runs across the iliopubic eminence through the muscular lacuna to its insertion on the lesser trochanter of the femur. The iliopectineal bursa separates the tendon of the iliopsoas muscle from the external surface of the hip joint capsule at the level of the iliopubic eminence. The iliac subtendinous bursa lies between the lesser trochanter and the attachment of the iliopsoas. =Nerve supply= Innervation of the psoas major is through the anterior rami of L1 to L3 nerves. =Variation= In fewer than 50 percent of human subjects,Platzer (2004), p 234 the psoas major is accompanied by the psoas minor. One study using autopsy data found that the psoas major muscle is substantially thicker in men of African descent than in Caucasian men, and that the occurrence of the psoas minor is also ethnically variant, being present in most of the white subjects and absent in most of the black subjects. In mice, it is mostly a fast-twitching, type II muscle, while in human it combines slow and fast-twitching fibers. Function The psoas major joins the upper body and the lower body, the axial to the appendicular skeleton, the inside to the outside, and the back to the front. As part of the iliopsoas, psoas major contributes to flexion in the hip joint. On the lumbar spine, unilateral contraction bends the trunk laterally, while bilateral contraction raises the trunk from its supine position.Thieme Atlas of Anatomy (2006), p 422 In addition, attachment to the lesser trochanter, located on the postero-medial aspect of the femur, causes lateral rotation and weak adduction of the hip. It forms part of a group of muscles called the hip flexors, whose action is primarily to lift the upper leg towards the body when the body is fixed or to pull the body towards the leg when the leg is fixed. For example, when doing a sit-up that brings the torso (including the lower back) away from the ground and towards the front of the leg, the hip flexors (including the iliopsoas) will flex the spine upon the pelvis. Owing to the frontal attachment on the vertebrae, rotation of the spine will stretch the psoas. Clinical significance Tightness of the psoas can result in spasms or lower back pain by compressing the lumbar discs.Akuthota, et all(2008). p 40 A hypertonic and inflamed psoas can lead to irritation and entrapment of the ilioinguinal and the iliohypogastric nerves, resulting in a sensation of heat or water running down the front of the thigh. Psoas can be palpated with active flexion of the hip. A positive psoas contracture test and pain with palpation reported by the patient indicate clinical significance. Care should be taken around the abdominal organs, especially the colon when palpating deeply. The appearance of a protruding belly can visually indicate a hypertonic psoas, which pulls the spine forward while pushing the abdominal contents outward. The psoas lies postero-lateral to the lumbar sympathetic ganglia, and the needle tip will often pass through the psoas major during a lumbar sympathetic block. The genitofemoral nerve is formed in the midsection of the psoas muscle by the union of branches from the anterior rami of L1 and L2 nerve roots. The nerve then courses inferiorly within the psoas muscle and finally \\"pierces\\" the muscle and emerges on the anterior surface of the psoas distally. The nerve then traverses the retroperitoneum, descending over the anterior surface of the psoas.

Biography  Herberto Helder was born in the Portuguese Atlantic island of Madeira. In 1946 he traveled to Lisbon to complete his secondary studies and subsequently in 1948 moved to Coimbra to study Law at university. In 1949 he had changed to the Humanities University to study Romance Philology but dropped out after three years without completing the course. After returning to Lisbon he took up several temporary jobs, and got in contact with a circle of artists and writers such as M√°rio Cesariny, Luiz Pacheco, Jo√£o Vieira and H√©lder Macedo. This group revolved around Surrealism which would inform his early writings. In 1958 his first book, O Amor em Visita was published. In the following years he traveled and lived in France, Holland and Belgium taking menial jobs to survive.

Considered one of the most important contemporary Portuguese poets his poetry is not yet enough studied by academics due to the obscurity of his personality itself (he refused to take literary prizes or have media exposure) and the complexity of his paradoxal work that has a strange enchantment.

Biography Jacobson was working as a high school teacher in Detroit when, in the fall of 1932, he was recruited to work for the Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU) by the Comintern agent \\"Mrs. Morton\\", a pseudonym of Aino Kuusinen, the wife of the Finnish communist leader Otto Kuusinen. He traveled to New York where the fledgling GRU agent Whittaker Chambers was assigned the task of meeting Jacobson and making a fitness report. Chambers advised against Jacobson's use as an underground agent because of his truculent temperament and the fact that he was missing fingers on one hand. Nevertheless, the GRU sent him to Europe as part of an apparatus of Soviet agents, led by the wife of Alfred Tilton, that operated in Finland. The Finnish police uncovered the group after a suspected Army Officer fled to the Soviet Union with military secrets. Jacobson was arrested in October 1933, along with his wife, and he promptly confessed to his role as an agent and revealed the existence of another Soviet apparatus working in Paris which included Lydia Stahl and Robert Gordon Switz. After a secret trial, the Finnish court sentenced Jacobson to six years imprisonment in April 1934. He was subsequently pardoned in July 1935 and returned to the United States.

Located in western Kyoto, Japan, it was founded in AD 888 by the retired Emperor Uda. It is part of the Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. History Ninna-ji was founded in the early Heian period. In 886, Emperor K≈çk≈ç ordered the construction of the Nishiyama Goganji Temple to bless the nation and propagate Buddhist teachings, but he did not live to see its completion. Emperor Uda saw the construction to its completion in 888 and named it \\"Ninna\\" after the regnal year of the late Emperor K≈çk≈ç's reign. From 888 to 1869 it was traditional for reigning Emperors to send a son to the temple to take over as head priest when a vacancy arose. After retiring from his throne, Emperor Uda became the first Monzeki, or aristocratic priest, of Ninna-ji. From then on until the end of the Edo period, the temple saw a succession of head priests of imperial lineage. In 1467, the temple was destroyed by fire and fighting in the ≈ånin War. It was rebuilt roughly 150 year later, thanks to the eldest son of Emperor Go-Y≈çzei, Kakushin Hosshinn≈ç, who enlisted the help of Tokugawa Iemitsu, the third sh≈çgun of the Tokugawa shogunate. The resurrection coincided with the rebuilding of the Imperial Palace in Kyoto and thus received imperial funding. The tradition of having aristocratic or persons of imperial lineage serve as chief of the temple ended with the 30th Monzeki, Junnin Hosshinn≈ç in the late Edo period. Most of the surviving buildings date from the 17th century, and include a five-story pagoda and an orchard of late blooming dwarf cherry trees called the Omuro cherry trees that would grow to around 2-3 meters (10 feet) in height.

McLaughlin is a former American Democratic politician and labor leader from Flushing, Queens. McLaughlin was a New York Assemblyman elected in 1992 to represent the 25th district in New York City. He was also elected, in June 1995, as the President of the Council on New York Labor. McLaughlin was arrested October 17, 2006, on charges of stealing more than $2 million from the State of New York and labor unions. After his arrest, he announced that he would not run for re-election, and left office at the end of 2006. In March 2008, McLaughlin pleaded guilty to charges of racketeering and embezzlement. On May 20, 2009, he was found guilty of these charges and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. Early life and family McLaughlin was born in Inwood, Manhattan, New York, and grew up in Queens. His family moved to Brentwood, Long Island, when he was 10. His paternal grandfather, Miles McLaughlin, an electrician, was an immigrant from County Cavan, Ireland. McLaughlin's father was also an electrician, who worked for years as chief electrician at The New York Times. His mother held jobs at General Motors and Gertz department stores. None of his family went to college. Both McLaughlin's father and his paternal grandfather were union activists; Miles McLaughlin sat on labor leader Harry Van Arsdale's \\"Committee of 100.\\" In his high school yearbook, McLaughlin's stated career ambition was practical: electrician. He later dropped out of Bridgeport University and did become an electrician. Career =Electrician work and higher education= McLaughlin started his career as a journeyman electrician. He belonged to Local 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and was one of the union's business representatives. At a union meeting, he met labor leader Harry Van Arsdale, Jr., head of the CLC, who would become his mentor. Van Arsdale also came out of Local 3 of the IBEW, which was \\"long the most politically active building trades union in New York\\". Mr. Van Arsdale convinced McLaughlin that a job as a unionized electrician and a college degree were not incompatible, and persuaded him to attend night school. While McLaughlin was working as an electrician, he attended the Empire State College of the State University of New York and eventually graduated with a B.S. He also attended the New York Institute of Technology, where he earned a master's degree in Industrial Labor Relations. He later said that at this time he also worked on honing his leadership qualities. According to The New York Times, Van Arsdale \\"tutored Mr. McLaughlin on the ins and outs of labor politics and electoral politics.\\" In 1981, Van Arsdale \\"gave the ambitious young electrician a huge responsibility ‚Äì to organize the first Labor Day Parade in the city in decades.\\" Eventually McLaughlin left his electrician job and went to work for the CLC. =Politics= In 2003, McLaughlin was quoted about his happenstance of being a politician, saying he entered \\"politics quite by accident... I don't particularly like politics, and I have no ego for it, quite frankly... I guess all of us would say it's disproportionately influenced by money. But in the end, it's a process where you have a limited opportunity to champion and better the situation of the people who elected you. And if you don't have determination, it's an unfriendly process.\\" Democratic district leader McLaughlin, according to the New York Times, \\"was drafted into running for Democratic district leader in 1986 with the Queens Democratic Party in disrepair after the suicide of Donald R. Manes; he won by 86 votes.\\" New York State Assembly In 1992, McLaughlin was elected to the New York State Assembly from the 25th Assembly District, which covers a portion of eastern Queens. He served as Chairman of the Democratic Conference and also sat on the influential Ways and Means Committee. While in the Assembly, he was author of the Sharps Bill, designed to prevent workplace injuries in the health-care industry. McLaughlin was remembered as \\"not a particularly high-profile legislator; most of his influence was exerted as a union chief.\\" A February 2002 report noted that St. Ann's Athletic Association in Flushing had received $4,000 from McLaughlin for uniforms, equipment, and facilities, an appropriation he had introduced into the 1999 state budget. McLaughlin stated, \\"Studies have shown that when kids play sports they are less likely to use drugs and get in trouble, and they are more likely to stay in school.\\" Mayoral ambitions In 2003, there was speculation of a possible McLaughlin run for the New York mayor's office in the 2005 election. By October 2003, he had raised over $1 million of campaign funds for a possible run. =Labor Council= During McLaughlin's tenure at the Council on New York City Labor, he served as the assistant to the son of the first president of the organization, Thomas Van Arsdale. In 1986, Van Arsdale's father, Harry Van Arsdale, Jr., died, and he assumed his father's position in the organization as president. The Labor Council today reigns as the largest municipal labor council in the country, a federation with 400 union locals and over 1 million members. In June 1995, McLaughlin succeeded Van Arsdale as the president of the CLC in a landslide election; Thomas Van Arsdale floundered in the position and McLaughlin was charged with re-energizing the council. The Labor Council represents laborers from a wide range of industries and enterprises. The union locals that belong to the organization \\"represent workers ranging from public school teachers to crane operators to employees at the Bronx Zoo, The council's main responsibilities are coordinating the various unions' political activities and placing labor's overall weight behind individual unions during organizing drives and strikes.\\" McLaughlin is also recognized for a number of achievements during his tenure at the CLC. He \\"was among the most influential labor leaders in New York City and in the state, providing pivotal early support for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's re-election and supporting the failed effort to build a football stadium on the Far West Side of Manhattan. He led the fight to keep Wal-Mart out of the city and lent strong support to transit workers\\" during a 2005 strike. McLaughlin had also been courted by not just the mayor, but also bishops, corporate CEOs and real estate magnates, thus emerging \\"as a major player in some of the biggest municipal battles\\" of 2006, \\"including the transit strike and the West Side stadium fight.\\" As head of the Labor Council, McLaughlin led the annual Labor Day Parade. In 2001, he praised the selection of United Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten as grand marshal of that year's parade. \\"Throughout the years, labor has focused on certain issues - the eight-hour workday, a livable minimum wage, the protection of Social Security. This year our attention will be on the need for quality public schools... Randi Weingarten has not only been an outstanding labor leader in this city. In a time where [sic] teacher bashing and finger- pointing, she has been a beacon in fighting for teachers and students.\\" On October 4, 2003, as New York chairman of the Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride, McLaughlin presided over a rally of 100,000 immigrants and their supporters at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park and spoke up for illegal-immigrant workers: \\"The labor movement is well placed to redefine itself around the needs of those who most need a labor union.\\" In 2004, McLaughlin protested Mayor Bloomberg's fiscal austerity, saying, \\"Now is the time to invest in our public employees who have not let us down... Years of privatization and productivity schemes from City Hall have gotten us nowhere.\\" In 2006, after McLaughlin's indictment, he was defended for his accomplishments; labor leaders \\"credited him with reinvigorating the Central Labor Council in a city where unions were once far more powerful.\\" One of the many local labor leaders to praise McLaughlin during his indictment, was most notably Randi Weingarten, President of the United Federation of Teachers: \\"Brian took over the Central Labor Council when it was at its lowest point in terms of power, prestige and stature and made it into an important institution again... One of his big strengths is that even if you're in a fight that's unpopular, he'll stand with you.\\" Moskowitz hearings on UFT contracts In December 2003, it was understood that New York City Councilwoman Eva Moskowitz had \\"garnered the undisguised ire of Randi Weingarten, the powerful head of the U.F.T., and Brian McLaughlin\\" by \\"publicly airing the work rules that many education reformers have criticized for years.\\" When Moskowitz held hearings in November 2003 \\"on how union contracts imposed inane work rules on public schools and made it nearly impossible for principals to fire bad teachers,\\" she \\"went toe to toe\\" with Weingarten, who arranged to have McLaughlin, a longtime friend and ally, at her side during the confrontation. McLaughlin, who had opposed the hearings, said that he was there \\"to remind the city council members that the entire labor movement in the city is watching them.\\" Influenced by McLaughlin's presence, then City Councilman Bill de Blasio, a strong labor supporter who would later become mayor, \\"did what he could to distance himself from Moskowitz during the hearing.\\" The New York Daily News stated in an issue of November 2003, \\"McLaughlin did not testify. But with 1.5 million members in his labor council - many of them active, Democratic voters - he didn't have to. McLaughlin's show of political muscle demonstrated how unnerved the unions are by the hearings.\\" In November, 2003, McLaughlin gave a speech at Queens College criticizing Moskowitz's hearings. He accused Gifford Miller, the City Council Speaker, of making \\"--referencing to Eve Moskowitz--at the expense of the careers of \\"over 100,000 workers\\"‚Äîreferencing New York public school teachers‚Äîwho \\"were ridiculed in the process.\\" McLaughlin, stating that labor had \\"built our city,\\" simply saying that it was time \\"to get tough and play offense.\\" A local newspaper, attempting to make sense of the speech, stated: \\"Clearly, here was the labor candidate denouncing the anti-labor candidate in no uncertain terms in what will be recalled as the day the race for the 2005 Democratic mayoral primary got off the mark.\\" Other activism McLaughlin was part of a coalition urging the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation to commit $1 billion in post-9/11 federal funding to the Liberty Jobs plan. He led the 2003 Labor for Democracy campaign in reaction to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's effort to increase voter participation by replacing the 2003 party primaries with a charter referendum proposal. \\"If not the labor movement,\\" he said, \\"then who is going to stand up and speak out for the working people? Sure, I'm looking cynically at the mayor's proposal; this smells of politics. What's broken? What's he trying to fix? The medicine we're trying to give the patient is not what the doctor prescribed. It imperils democracy.\\" McLaughlin, in collaboration with Randi Weingarten, Rev. Al Sharpton and others, was part of a coalition that organized a march against police brutality. In 2003, he started, as the New York chairman of the Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride, a campaign which called for \\"a road to citizenship, the reunification of families, a voice and dignity in the workplace, and the civil rights of all people.\\" At the 2004 Republican National Convention, he worked with convention organizers to negotiate no-strike labor agreements, in order to secure the convention's venue in New York. However, during the convention, he organized a rally of unionists from a wide variety of trades to protest certain Bush Administration labor policies. Indictment, trial and imprisonment =Indictment= In March 2006, the FBI raided McLaughlin's offices, making public the fact that he was being investigated. In October 2006, McLaughlin was indicted on 44 federal counts, including racketeering, money laundering, bank and mail fraud, labor bribery, and embezzlement. He was placed under arrest. \\"He was accused of stealing from virtually every organization with which he was involved,\\" said the New York Post. At the news conference announcing the 186-page indictment, Michael J. Garcia, the United States Attorney for Manhattan, described the extent of McLaughlin's alleged financial misdeeds as \\"stunning in its breadth and scope,\\" and said, \\"This case lends a new meaning to the term 'hand in the till'... \\"What we have here is really a story of greed.\\" The New York Times reported that McLaughlin had legally made \\"$263,600 in combined salaries and expenses as an assemblyman and labor council president.\\" The Times further described the charges as \\"ranging from the Dickensian (stealing $95,000 from Little League baseball teams to pay his rent) to the brazen (creating two no-show jobs on his legislative payroll and keeping part of one salary).\\" Labor experts expressed shock when hearing of the charges brought to McLaughlin. Labor historian Joshua Freeman, of the City University of New York, said, \\"If these charges prove true, it's certainly a blot on the union movement.\\" According to the charges, McLaughlin had stolen \\"more than $2.2 million from the state, his union, his political club, his campaign and a Little League.\\" The Little League team in question, from which McLaughlin had allegedly skimmed $95,000, was run by the Electchester Athletic Association. McLaughlin had reportedly \\"solicited donations for the team, which he founded, then took the money after it was deposited in one of the organization's bank accounts.\\" According to the indictment, McLaughlin became furious \\"when he learned a team official tried to use $2,800 to pay for legitimate softball expenses,\\" saying: \\"All that f-----g money he's f-----g spending on other stuff, that ain't his money... That's mine.\\" The indictment also alleged that McLaughlin got the United Way charity to fund a Commission on the Dignity of Immigrants program. It was reported that McLaughlin \\"put a relative in charge who funneled his $94,000 salary back to him.\\" The indictment charged that McLaughlin \\"took more than $140,000 from the street lights division of Local 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, for which he served as business representative,\\" plus \\"$185,000 from the Central Labor Council, more than $35,000 from the State Assembly, and more than $330,000 from his own re-election committee.\\" Moreover, it charged that \\"he illegally received more than $1.4 million from street-lighting contractors and other companies and that the lighting contractors gave him three cars ‚Äî one of which he gave to his son and another to a second woman with whom he had a close personal relationship.\\" The indictment also charged that McLaughlin had \\"used subordinates as 'personal servants,' to take his dog to the veterinarian, hang Christmas lights, trap rodents in his basement and clean out his barn.\\" He was \\"also charged with making an aide use his E-ZPass at tollbooths to make it appear that he had returned home from Albany later than he really had, allowing him to bill for daily allowances given to legislators.\\" Moreover, he was \\"accused of using more than $330,000 from his re-election campaign funds to pay for personal expenses like a rehearsal dinner for his son's wedding, renovation of his $760,000 house in Suffolk County near Long Island Sound, payment of his country club membership fees and the purchase and installation of a plasma television for a female friend.\\" In addition, McLaughlin was \\"charged with using stolen money for an $80,000 Mercedes-Benz for his wife, marina fees, school tuition for one of his children, rent payments on his Albany residence and rent payments on his Queens residence.\\" McLaughlin was also charged with accepting $450,000 in payments from Argent Electric, owned by former New York City Mayor Abe Beame's son, Bernard \\"Buddy\\" Beame, as part of a secret partnership dating back to 1999, when the city decided to switch from regular traffic lights to light- emitting diodes (LEDs). Argent sought the contract to provide the LEDs; McLaughlin, who as head of the CLC represented electrical workers, \\"could have failed to provide the number of electrical workers needed, or send people who weren't skilled,\\" thereby sabotaging the contract. Beame \\"paid him to prevent that.\\" In return for efforts by McLaughlin and an associate at the CLC on Argent's behalf, including pressuring contractors to buy LED units from a firm represented by Argent and encouraging contractors and CLC members to buy Argent products, Beame gave McLaughlin and his associate half of Argent's profits. The indictment also accused McLaughlin of using the Street Lighting Association fund \\"as his personal piggy bank, routinely diverting money earmarked for union members to himself, relatives and close friends.\\" Post-indictment According to federal authorities, most of the money McLaughlin stole reportedly \\"went to turn McLaughlin's home in tony Nissequogue, L.I., into a mansion, complete with wine cellar and gazebo.\\" Some of his ill-gotten gains \\"funded... 'personal relationships' with a number of women.\\" One of these women, Eleanore Levitas, was allegedly paid sizable sums in 2000 \\"for 'consulting services' to McLaughlin's re-election campaign committee,\\" was put on the CLC payroll, and was given \\"a no-show job with a street-light contractor.\\" Levitas \\"angrily denied\\" the charges involving her, describing herself as a victim of McLaughlin, but her step-uncle, Demetrius Pabers, told a reporter that McLaughlin had picked her up in a strip club in Queens, where she was stripping at the time, had showered her with money, and had given her a no-show job. She insisted that it had been a real job. \\"What upsets me is I look like his partner in crime. I'm nothing close to that.\\" Another one of the women whom McLaughlin had allegedly showered with gifts and cash was reported to be Sonia Menezes, \\"an attractive beauty-spa operator with whom he carried on a long-term relationship.\\" McLaughlin, represented by Jonathan Bach, pleaded not guilty at his arraignment in Federal District Court in Manhattan before Magistrate Judge James C. Francis IV. It was noted that McLaughlin could face up to 500 years in prison if convicted of all charges. After learning of the indictment, UFT president Randi Weingarten, a longtime friend and ally of McLaughlin, told the New York Times, \\"I've been walking around all day stunned.\\" ... It's like when you hear someone you're close to has suddenly died. But nobody wants to jump to any conclusions.\\" Weingarten suggested that perhaps the FBI had conducted the raid on McLaughlin's office as a means of pressuring him to provide evidence against others. She said that she had just lunched with McLaughlin on the previous Wednesday and \\"was shocked to learn of the allegations... I don't think any of us know enough to judge anything today, other than that our hearts go out to Brian and his family.\\" Following the news of the indictment, the CLC's 32-member executive board voted unanimously to suspend salary payments to McLaughlin, who at the time was on a paid leave of absence. Weingarten, a member of the board, only said that the vote \\"speaks for itself.\\" Shortly after McLaughlin's arrest, he was reportedly described by his staffers as \\"the cheapest boss on two feet,\\" who had \\"refused to pay Christmas bonuses and argued over paying a staffer's health insurance.\\" In addition, he had compelled union workers to serve as his personal drivers. One McLaughlin staffer said, \\"McLaughlin never should have been allowed by a state ethics panel to simultaneously run a union and serve as state Assemblyman... In some twisted way, he thought it was OK.\\" In November 2006, McLaughlin was removed from his post as CLC president. He had already announced in January 2006 that he would not be running for re-election to the New York State Assembly. In August 2007, it was reported that McLaughlin, who was out on bail pending trial, had been \\"last spotted a few months ago working as an electrician again for the first time in a quarter- century - this time making $46 an hour at an apartment house under construction on Manhattan's West Side.\\" He was quoted as saying, \\"I'm back at work because I need to work.\\" =Trial= In March 2008, McLaughlin entered a plea of guilty in exchange for a reduced potential sentence. Asked her opinion of this development, UFT president Randi Weingarten said, \\"Brian McLaughlin was a colleague and a close friend... this is a sad day for him, his family, and the labor movement.\\" At his trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan, prosecutors \\"charged that Mr. McLaughlin had misappropriated more than $330,000 from his own re-election committee; $185,000 from the New York City Central Labor Council, which he led; and more than $35,000 from the State Assembly. They said he had created fictitious jobs within the labor council and on his own legislative staff, and took kickbacks from the jobholders.\\" After McLaughlin was found guilty in May 2009, federal prosecutor Daniel A. Braun asked for leniency, saying he had provided substantial assistance to the government. McLaughlin's lawyer, Michael F. Armstrong, said, \\"This is someone who at core is a good person who went terribly wrong, and who realizes that, and realizes it fully.\\" McLaughlin apologized to the judge for his \\"improper conduct and criminal activity,\\" saying that he made no excuses for it, but adding, \\"over the last three, three and a half years, I've had the opportunity to live the way I'd like to live my life.\\" The New York Times described this as \\"an apparent reference to steps he has taken toward rehabilitation like attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, as well as cooperating with the government.\\" Judge Richard J. Sullivan, however, rejected requests for leniency, and sentenced McLaughlin to ten years in prison and a $25,000 fine. \\"You had every opportunity,\\" said Sullivan, \\"and you used those opportunities and squandered them for your own benefit on a monumental scale.\\" The prosecution's request for leniency was reportedly based on the fact that McLaughlin had aided in the investigation of other public officials who had committed crimes, such as fellow Assemblyman Anthony S. Seminerio, but Sullivan said McLaughlin's betrayal of public trust \\"outweighed any assistance he had given.\\" Noting his receipt of dozens of letters supporting McLaughlin, including one from AFL-CIO president John Sweeney citing McLaughlin's \\"long record of service to the working men and women of New York City,\\" Sullivan said that the portrait of McLaughlin painted by Sweeney and others did not jibe with the picture that emerged from courtroom evidence of \\"a man who so abused the trust of institutions and people who depended on him that it sort of staggers the mind.\\" Sullivan added that McLaughlin's actions confirmed \\"the harshest critics of organized labor who accuse the leadership of corruption, and point to you as an example of that corruption.\\" Sullivan ordered McLaughlin, who remained free on bond, to surrender on July 21. Post- trial In July 2009, electrical contractor Santo Petrocelli, Sr., of the Petrocelli Electric Company, pleaded guilty to making thousands of dollars in illegal payments to McLaughlin at the latter's request. Petrocelli said he had made the payments to avoid a worker slowdown. McLaughlin \\"controlled all the labor,\\" Petrocelli said. \\"We certainly didn't want any problems with the local.\\" The relationship between McLaughlin and Petrocelli, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan, had lasted from the mid-1990s through 2006, and had involved hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash payments, in return for which McLaughlin had used his position to benefit Petrocelli's business. As of August, 2011, it was reported that McLaughlin \\"promised to pay back everybody he stole from... Yet none of his victims - who are owed more than $845,000 - have been repaid.\\" The sum included $90,085 owed to the Electchester Athletic Association's Little League team. He also owed $276,383 to the electrical workers' union, $268,821 to the NY Central Labor Council, $32,274 to the state Assembly, $19,475 to a Queens political club and $153,939 to Welsbach Electric of College Point. He had sold his Nissequogue, L.I. home for $652,000 and sold his $80,000 Mercedes, and in March 2010 had delivered a \\"$457,253 check to prosecutors with the expenditure marked 'preliminary order of forfeiture'\\"; yet as of August 2011 still had \\"more than $285,000 in the campaign war chest - sitting in a tax-free bond account earning interest.\\" Alleged paramours There were multiple implications and testimonies of McLaughlin's extra-marital engagements with multiple women. The most notable were New York City Councilwoman Elizabeth Crowley, Eleanore Levitas (an alleged stripper who took a \\"no-show\\" job for a paycheck), and Sonia Menezes (a beauty salon owner). Awards McLaughlin won the Labor Achievement Award, presented by New Democratic Dimensions. Personal life Brian McLaughlin and his wife Eva have five children: Brian, Kelly, Robert, Cassie, and Meaghan McLaughlin. At the time of his indictment, he had an apartment in Queens; a house in Nissequogue, New York, purchased in 2003 for $760,000; a home in Melbourne Beach, Florida, bought for $81,000 in 1999, and a residence in Albany, New York.

The film was directed by Arjun Sablok and produced by Future Group owner Kishore Biyani. The title of the film was taken from the song of Roshan's debut film Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai. Upon release, it met with extremely negative reviews and was a box office disaster despite having a stellar cast.  Plot  Esha Malhotra (Esha Deol) is a bright, spirited girl who has just left college. She finds a note from a past student of her school that coincides with her own feelings of love. She calls into a radio station and requests a song, repeating the words left on the note. An anonymous man calls in soon after, stating that he is the one who had written the letter and he would like to meet her someday since they seem to have the same feelings about love and other aspects in life. The radio announcer sets up a date and time for their meeting at the radio station. The man arrives but finds only a letter waiting for him. The letter does not state her name or address, only a post box number to which she requests him to write so that they can be friends. The correspondence begins. The man turns out to be a photographer and commercial pilot Rahul Sharma (Hrithik Roshan). They do not meet, exchange numbers, or tell their names but continue to write to each other. Fate brings the two together when Esha hires Rahul to be their photographer for a campaign. Of course, she didn't know it was him nor he did that it was her. Esha's grandfather wants her to get married and thus he arranges for her to meet Akshay Kapoor (Saif Ali Khan), a flirt and womaniser who also happens to be Rahul's best friend. Esha has fallen in love with her pen pal and does not want to marry Akshay. However, Akshay is falling for Esha. A lovestruck Rahul arranges to meet the one to whom he writes letters. Much to his shock though, he finds out it is Esha. Because of his friendship with Akshay, who is deeply in love with Esha, Rahul decides to forget her. Esha, unable to contact her anonymous love, agrees to wed Akshay. Rahul leaves for Vancouver the day before the wedding, vowing never to be seen again. Four years later, in a mall in Canada, Rahul meets Akshay, who now has a son. Rahul thinks he is about to meet Esha but instead meets Akshay's former girlfriend, who is now his wife. Akshay explains that he could not marry Esha in the end because she still loves her mystery writer. Suddenly, a group of workers in the mall carry in a large portrait of Esha, and Akshay realises that Rahul is the mystery writer Esha fell in love with. He urges Rahul to hurry back to India so Rahul does so and reunites with Esha.  Cast  *Hrithik Roshan as Rahul Sharma *Saif Ali Khan as Akshay Kapoor *Esha Deol ...

Biography Born in Berlin as Ludwig Cohen, his father was a successful Jewish industrialist. In 1933 he emigrated to Paris and in 1941 he left war-torn Paris for the United States where he married Rose Laub. In the Fifties, he enrolled as a graduate student in sociology at Columbia University, taking his PhD at the age of forty-one. Coser first taught at the University of Chicago and the University of California. He then founded the sociology department at Brandeis University and taught there for 15 years before joining the sociology department of the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Coser frequently worked with the eminent sociologist and his spouse, Rose Laub Coser. Sociology Coser was the first sociologist to try to bring together structural functionalism and conflict theory; his work was focused on finding the functions of social conflict. Coser argued ‚Äì with Georg Simmel ‚Äì that conflict might serve to solidify a loosely structured group. In a society that seems to be disintegrating, conflict with another society, inter-group conflict, may restore the integrative core. For example, the cohesiveness of Israeli Jews might be attributed to the long-standing conflict with the Arabs. Conflict with one group may also serve to produce cohesion by leading to a series of alliances with other groups. Conflicts within a society, intra-group conflict, can bring some ordinarily isolated individuals into an active role. The protest over the Vietnam War motivated many young people to take vigorous roles in American political life for the first time. Conflicts also serve a communication function. Prior to conflict, groups may be unsure of their adversary‚Äôs position, but as a result of conflict, positions and boundaries between groups often become clarified, leaving individuals better able to decide on a proper course of action in relation to their adversary. Much like status consistency, conflicts along the same cleavages intensify the severity of the conflict. Cross-cutting cleavages tend to dissipate the severity of the conflict. For example, the coincidence of economic and political disenfranchisement among Palestinians in the West Bank intensify their conflict with Israeli Jews. In contrast, the non-coincidence of economic and political disenfranchisement among Quebecers reduces somewhat the severity of their conflict with English Canada, especially with the rising prosperity of the French Canadian new middle class operating in the public sector and corporate world. Politics Coser was active within the anti-Stalinist left, and was close to the independent leftists known as the New York intellectuals. A eulogy at Carlo Tresca's memorial service in 1943 was delivered by Angelica Balabanoff, the socialist activist and former Bolshevik. According to Coser's account of the funeral, \\"I was sitting near a burly Irish policeman who clearly didn't understand a word of Balabanoff's fierce Italian oratory. But at her climax he burst into tears.\\" In 1954, with Irving Howe, Coser established the radical journal, Dissent. Upon his death in 2003, the author of his obituary in that magazine suggested that Coser \\"always felt himself a marginal man. He was Jewish and non-Jewish; an American and a European; a hardheaded social analyst, committed to rigorous honesty in judgment and deed, and a passionate advocate; a leftist and a critic of the left; a defender of the underdog and something of an elite intellectual mandarin.\\" His The new conservatives: A critique from the left (with Irving Howe, 1974) was one of the first major works to define and analyse neoconservatism.

This all-nation cultural institution of the Slovaks was established in 1863 as a result of the Slovak national efforts to lay the foundations of Slovak science, libraries and museums. Nowadays it is governed by the \\"Act on Matica slovensk√°\\" of 1997. The anniversary of the 1863 establishment of Matica slovensk√° on August 4 is locally known as De≈à Matice Slovenskej, a Remembrance Day in Slovakia.  Name  The modern sense of the name is Slovak Foundation/Association, historically: Slovak (Bee) Mother. Matica slovensk√°'s name is a source of puzzlement among many Slovaks. \\"Matica\\" used in this context is a Serbian word and means \\"source\\" or \\"mother bee\\". The Matica concept of volunteer cultural associations became popular in other Slavic countries. In today's Slovak language, \\"matica\\" means \\"matrix\\". \\"Matica\\" used in this context is as well a Slovak word and it means to: connect to something more solid (connect to motherboard): [\\"pritiahn√∫≈• ku, skr√∫ti≈•, pripoji≈•, spoji≈• a neoddeli≈•\\"]. In this context \\"matica slovensk√°\\" could easily be understood as sort of attachment, being linked to its Slavic predecessors and its Slavic history to its motherland.  History  = The first Matica (1863 - 1875) = The first seat of Matica slovensk√° in city of Martin The founding of the Matica was inspired by the establishment of the Serbian Matica (Matica srpska) in 1826 and of the Czech \\"Matice ƒçesk√°\\" in 1831. The Slovak Matica went on from the Tatr√≠n association (1844 ‚Äì 1849, the first Slovak nationwide cultural institution). Slovakia was part of the Kingdom of Hungary, which in turn was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It was the Austrian emperor who ‚Äì as a reaction to the many requirements of the 1861 Memorandum of the Slovak Nation - allowed the Slovaks to found a national cultural institution ‚Äì they were allowed to found a \\"unity of lovers of Slovak life and nation\\". As a result, the Matica slovensk√° was founded on August 4, 1863 at an assembly of some 5000 Slovak patriots in Turƒçiansky Sv√§t√Ω Martin (today Martin). It was based in the same town and was financed exclusively by voluntary donations from Slovaks and from the Austrian emperor. The first chairman was ≈†tefan Moyses and his vice- chairmen were Karol Kuzm√°ny, J√°n Orsz√°gh and J√°n Francisci-Rimavsk√Ω. In 1873, the Matica had some 1300 members, many of which included entities such as municipalities, libraries, schools and associations. Memorial plaque at first building of Matica The Matica slovensk√° drew members from all parts of the nation. It became the representative and symbol of Slovak \\"independence\\". From the beginning, the Matica was forbidden to be involved in political activities and to establish local branches. Nevertheless, its supporters could be found in many towns and settlements and its membership was quite large. The Matica was especially involved in collecting activities ‚Äì it laid the foundation of national librarianship, and of archives and museum sciences in Slovakia. It also developed a broad education program for the public, published various practical manuals, calendars, readers, and scientific monographs, and initiated the development of amateur theatre and of social singing. It also supported research activities and published the results of the research in the first Slovak scientific journal \\"Letopisy\\" (literally: annals). Finally, the Slovak National Museum was founded within the Matica. The establishment of scientific departments (linguistics, law and history, philosophy, mathematics etc.) was in preparation in 1871, but could not be carried out anymore before 1875 (see below). Gradually, Matica became a center for organizing the national life of the Slovaks and served as a substitute for national political institutions, whose establishment was prohibited in the Kingdom of Hungary under the conditions of strong Magyarisation efforts. The then Hungarian minister of the interior K√°lm√°n Tisza had Matica abolished by force ‚Äì by the decree No. 125 of April 6, 1875 and confiscation of its property (consisting exclusively of donations) in favour of the state. The official reasons given were that Matica was \\"against the government\\" and \\"anti-patriotic\\" ‚Äì statements for which there was not the least evidence. The confiscated property went to support the process of enforced Magyarisation (e.g. the foundation of the pro-Magyarisation Upper Hungary Magyar Educational Society). When interpellated by a Serbian member of the Diet (there were no Slovak deputies in the Diet) why Matica's property was not returned to the Slovaks, the then prime minister K√°lm√°n Tisza answered that he did not know of a Slovak nation. = The second Matica (since 1919) = The Matica slovensk√° could not resume its activities until after the dissolution of the Kingdom of Hungary and establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918, when the conditions for the national life of the Slovaks improved. On August 5, 1919, it was reopened and rededicated in the presence President Tom√°≈° Masaryk. Matica slovensk√° played an important role in further development of Slovak culture and scholarship. lt was supported by a wide membership (in 1950, it had 1,125 local branches with more than 100,000 members). Institutional offices were built gradually. Local branches throughout Slovakia were primarily engaged in public education and cultural activities. The Matica also played a significant role in the development of amateur theatre. The Matica founded and operated one of the largest and most significant publishing houses in Slovakia, Neografia, which published scholarly journals, public education literature, classic and contemporary Slovak authors, translations of world literature, and especially supported and enhanced the publishing of literature for children and young people. The Matica established a unique collection of prints, manuscripts and pictures related to the development of Slovak national culture, which became the basis of the Slovak National Library. It also established several research sections (for history, literature, history, linguistics, ethnography, philosophy, sociology, psychology etc.), which publish series of books, journals etc. Before the establishment of the Slovak Academy of Sciences, the Matica was also the regulator of the Slovak language. The establishment of the Communist regime in 1948 initially threatened the existence of the Matica slovensk√°, since communist ideology, policy and the principles of socialist culture contradicted the principles upon which the Matica slovensk√° had been established. Local branches were dissolved, its research sections, journals and publishing activities gradually were transferred to other institutions or abolished. According to an act of the Slovak National Council of 1954, the Matica slovensk√° was reduced to the Slovak National Library and Biographic Institute with a limited role within the fields of librarianship, bibliography and archives. The Matica came under severe ideological and political control of the Communist party and of state organs. Many of the members of its staff were persecuted, discriminated or dismissed. The Communists did not manage to fully uproot the traditions and spirit of the Matica. They were manifested openly in 1963 during the celebrations of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Matica slovensk√° and culminated in 1968-69 (the Prague spring period) when Matica became a significant cultural and political institution again. An act of the Slovak National Council re-established the local branches, new working places were established and the foundations for a new modern building were laid. After the defeat of the reform movement in Czecho- Slovakia in 1969, the normalization regime almost liquidated the effort to renew the Matica slovensk√°. Current seat of Matica slovensk√° The collapse of the communist regime in November 1989 brought new environment for the development of Matica slovensk√° and the possibility for the public to become members has been renewed. In 1993 Matica made an agreement with the authoritarian prime minister of Slovakia Vladim√≠r Meƒçiar. In exchange for Matica's political support for his political party HZDS, he gave Matica the Neografia publishing house for 1 Slovak crowns, even though Matica was allowed to sell it at any time for over 600 million Slovak crowns. Neografia then started printing among others hard pornography, fascist memoirs of members of clerical separatist Hlinkova slovensk√° ƒæudov√° strana or the poetry of war criminal Radovan Karad≈æiƒá. The attitude of Matica and its members during the social and political struggles in Slovakia around 1989 ‚Äì 1995 was that it supported the ultra-conservative Languages Act, forcing the SNR to sign into law the VPN-version of the Languages Act and Matica also supported the Declaration of Independence of the Slovak Republic, both in 1992 (under Vladim√≠r Meƒçiar Slovakia declared independence without anyone as much as asking the Slovak public). Matica slovensk√° was also strongly against the integration of Slovak Republic into the European Union and NATO, despite the fact that this very integration had even been part of Vladim√≠r Meƒçiar's isolationist government declaration. Matica slovensk√° was also responsible for the collection of voluntary goods and money for the so-called \\"National Treasure\\", created in 1992, whose purpose was to help finance the activities of the Matica. The value of the \\"National Treasure\\" was almost 40 million Slovak crowns after 12 years (in February 2005). In 1994, Matica had some 450 local branches and approximately 60,000 members with club houses in many towns. In 2000 The National Council of the Slovak Republic approved the so- called the Library Act, which was prepared by Minister of Culture Milan K≈àa≈æko without the participation of Matica slovensk√°. The law damaged Matica slovensk√° and negatively affected its activities for several years. He had to leave the residential building in Martin in Hostihor, but also the historically first building - both belonged to the administration of the Slovak National Library. Matica is known for promoting a positive view of the World War II Slovak State, which is controversial due to that state's role in the deportation and murder of Slovak Jews. A 2017 video, \\"Without March 14\\" (the date of establishment of the Slovak State), which argued that the Jews would still have died if the Slovak State had not been founded.

Matica's position, functions and financing were amended by several acts, the last major one being Law no. 68 from February 13, 1997 Z.z. The very first definition dictated by the law is that Matica slovensk√° is a \\"verejnopr√°vna ustanovize≈à\\" a coupling of words that has never been explained in any law ever codified in the Slovak Republic (a problem that plagued the Slovak Television for a long time). Verejnopr√°vna can roughly be translated as \\"subject to public law\\" (same term used in Germany \\"√∂ffentlich-rechtlich\\"), ustanovize≈à means institution. Among Matica's functions are such nonsensical and vague definitions as for example \\"making the national cultural heritage current\\" (spr√≠tom≈àova≈• n√°rodn√© kult√∫rne dediƒçstvo). According to this law, Matica is also allowed to create textbooks for both elementary schools and high-schools in Slovakia. Matica slovensk√° is allowed by law to receive money from the state and at the same time make business with its own property. Moreover, Matica receives purpose-bound donations from the State budget of the Slovak Republic for fulfilling various tasks. Matica also receives resources from its members, from sponsors, other gifts and finally funds of the European Union (Matica being strongly anti-EU). Matica slovensk√° also seeks to establish and manage various foundations devoted to the support of Slovak national culture and research.  Controversy  Its financial activities are not transparent, despite receiving funds from taxpayers. According to an article by Eva Mihoƒçkov√° published in major Slovak weekly Plus 7 Dn√≠ on October 7, 2010, there is proof that Matica slovensk√° lost almost all of the money (23-28 million Slovak crowns) of the so-called Slovak national treasure, by investing it through a now-bankrupt company Capital Invest, into the Podielov√© dru≈æstvo Slovensk√© invest√≠cie (PDSI), a Non-bank financial institution. The total value of the National treasure was approximately 995 000 EUR, of which approximately 232 000 EUR consists of artworks and gold.http://www.cas.sk/clanok/179994/neuveritelne-matica- slovenska-vlozila-narodny-poklad-do-nebankovky.html Also, Matica slovensk√° recently started to publish its newspaper \\"Matiƒçn√© zvesti\\" as an annex of a newspaper published by Slovensk√© hnutie obrody, an association praising the WWII Slovak Republic and its leader Jozef Tiso. The editor of Matiƒçn√© zvesti said that the reason was lack of money for an own newspaper.

The Act authorizes the formation of Conservation Authorities on a per watershed basis. History A 21-year-old plantation of red pine in Southern Ontario. In 1941, conservationists from across the province met in Guelph to address the extensive damage to southern Ontario's environment. Great tracts of land had been ruined through over cutting of the forest and through faulty farming practices. The conference, under the leadership of J.D. Thomas, chose the Ganaraska watershed, one of the most damaged in the province, as its pilot project. Over the next few years, they worked to restore the natural values of the watershed, mostly by planting trees. Its restoration marked the beginning of the conservation authorities of Ontario. The Conservation Authorities Act was passed in 1946. Over the next four decades, the Ganaraska watershed became one of the largest forested areas of southern Ontario with two million trees planted. In 2019, the Government of Ontario passed amendments to the act, defining each conservation authority's required functions: > 1\\\\. A program or service that meets any of the following descriptions and > that has been prescribed by the regulations: * Programs and services related > to the risk of natural hazards * Programs and services related to the > conservation and management of lands owned or controlled by the authority, > including any interests in land registered on title * Programs and services > related to the authority's duties, functions and responsibilities as a > source protection authority under the Clean Water Act, 2006 * Programs and > services related to the authority's duties, functions and responsibilities > under an Act prescribed by the regulations 2\\\\. A program or service, other > than a program or service described in paragraph 1, that has been prescribed > by the regulations on or before the first anniversary of the day prescribed > under clause 40 (3) (h). 2019, c. 9, Sched. 2, s. 4. Source: Subsection 21.1, Amended Conservation Authorities Act. The Government also amended section 23, which provides for the Government to name an investigator: : \\"The Minister may, at any time, appoint one or more investigators to conduct an investigation of an authority‚Äôs operations, including the programs and services it provides.\\" These amendments have not yet been proclaimed into law. The Lieutenant-Governor will name a date of implementation. At the same time that the amendments were introduced into the Legislative Assembly, the Government cut its funding to conservation authorities for flood control from million per year by half, wanting the authorities to focus on \\"core\\" activities. The Ontario Government now funds only 1-5% of most conservation authority's operations. Authorities are largely funded by municipalities, self-generated revenue and fundraising.

In 1992, due to redistricting, Brennan‚Äôs district radically changed. He subsequently ran and defeated fellow incumbent Joni Yoswein in the new 44th Assembly District, which includes the neighborhoods of Flatbush, Kensington, Park Slope and Windsor Terrace. He chaired four committees during his career: six years as Chair of the Assembly Standing Committee on Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities, one year as Chair of the Assembly Committee on Oversight, Analysis, and Investigation, and Chair of the Assembly Committee on Cities. He most recently was the Chair of the Committee on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions.Committee assignments at New York State Assembly website Brennan has won three national awards as a State legislator. The first, in 1996, was given by the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill for Brennan‚Äôs leadership in the fight for parity in mental and physical health benefits. The second was given by the National Conference of State Legislators in 2007, for an investigative report directed by Brennan as Chair of the Committee on Investigation. The report concerned how the Pataki administration undermined services for the severely disabled as a result of the closure of a Medicaid office serving those clients in the fall of 2004. In 1998 and 1999, Brennan helped win funding for 5,000 new units of housing for the mentally ill in New York State. As Chair of the Cities Committee, Brennan authored two new laws in 2007, to improve public health and safety in construction and development in New York City‚Äîone cracking down on the filing of fraudulent building plans to the New York City Department of Buildings, and the other compelling the acquisition of insurance for excavations that might damage adjacent properties. Brennan also helped create the Restore New York program, a statewide effort to help distressed areas in cities by having the State pay to clear abandoned or vacant residential or commercial property with $300 million in funding.

The first passenger train hauled by No. 1 was a special service from Sydney Station to Long Cove viaduct (near the present site of Lewisham) on 24 May 1855, Queen Victoria's birthday. A common misconception is that Locomotive No.1 hauled the first train at the grand opening of the first New South Wales railway, on 26 September 1855. In fact, No. 1 was in need of maintenance that day and not in steam. Its identical sister locomotive No. 3 worked the first passenger train from Sydney at 9:00 am and this was followed by the official train at 12:00 noon hauled by No. 2, driven by William Sixsmith and fireman William Webster.Grunbach, A.

The first accident involving Locomotive No.1 was a derailment on 10 July 1858. Two people were killed when a passenger carriage left the rails and toppled down an embankment near Homebush. On 6 January 1868 a man was killed when Locomotive No. 1 collided with a passenger train at Newtown Station.

In 1893 it was moved to a special annex built at the Museum's Harris Street site.

It first appeared on their second studio album Strange Days. It was edited to a 2:37 length and released as the second single (after \\"People Are Strange\\") from that album, and reached number 25 on the charts in the United States. Ray Manzarek played the final version of this song on a harpsichord, not a clavichord. Manzarek described the instrument as \\"a most elegant instrument that one does not normally associate with rock and roll.\\" \\"Love Me Two Times\\" was considered to be somewhat risqu√© for radio airplay, being banned in New Haven for being \\"too controversial,\\" much to the dismay of the band. Lyrics As with the other songs on Strange Days, the album liner notes list the songwriters as the Doors as does the \\"Love Me Two Times\\" single; the performance rights organization ASCAP shows the writers as the individual Doors members. In his autobiography, Manzarek described the song as \\"Robby [Krieger]'s great blues/rock classic about lust and loss, or multiple orgasms, I'm not sure which\\". According to author Rich Weldman the song is about a sailor or soldier spending one last day with his girlfriend before shipping out to war. Critical reception In an AllMusic album review of Strange Days, critic Richie Unterberger described \\"Love Me Two Times\\" as \\"jerkily rhythmic\\". Rolling Stone called the song a \\"heavy, evocative and climatic piece\\". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also proclaimed that \\"The album‚Äôs most accessible, straightforward rock tune is the racy ‚ÄúLove Me Two Times,‚Äù which features a virtuosic harpsichord solo and one of the band‚Äôs grooviest guitar riffs.\\" Aerosmith version \\"Love Me Two Times\\" was recorded by Aerosmith for the soundtrack of the 1990 film Air America (whose producers, Carolco Pictures, would also produce a biopic about the Doors). The band also performed it at its 1990 MTV Unplugged performance, where lead singer Steven Tyler dedicated the song to Jim Morrison, who performed with the Doors at the same venue of the Unplugged performance, the Ed Sullivan Theater, several years prior. The 1990 cover reached number 27 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. In 2001, the song was included on their greatest hits album, Young Lust: The Aerosmith Anthology.

Approximately 2500 of this model and the parallel 13/35 and 15/50 models were made. The price was ¬£430 to ¬£460, expensive compared to a contemporary Wolseley 10 selling for ¬£250.

The Yalobusha River is a river, long, in north-central Mississippi in the United States. It is a principal tributary of the Yazoo River, via which it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River. The name \\"Yalobusha\\" comes from the Choctaw word yalooboshi, meaning \\"little tadpole\\", from yalooba, \\"tadpole\\", and -ushi, \\"diminutive\\". The United States Board on Geographic Names settled on the river's name in 1892. According to the Geographic Names Information System, it has also been known as \\"Yallabusha\\" and as the \\"Yellowbushy River.\\" Course The Yalobusha River rises in Chickasaw County, northwest of the town of Houston, and flows generally west-southwestwardly through Calhoun, Grenada and Leflore Counties, past the town of Grenada. At Greenwood it joins the Tallahatchie River to form the Yazoo River. Much of the Yalobusha's course through Calhoun County has been straightened and channelized; this section of the river is also known as the \\"Yalobusha River Canal.\\" In Grenada County, the river is impounded by a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam to form Grenada Lake, which collects the Yalobusha's largest tributary, the Skuna River.

Biography Constable was born around 1456/7. He was the eldest son and heir of Sir Robert Constable (4 April 1423 ‚Äì 23 May 1488) of Flamborough, Yorkshire, and Agnes Wentworth (d. 20 April 1496), daughter of Roger Wentworth of North Elmsall, Yorkshire, by Margery le Despencer. According to Horrox, the Constables of Flamborough were followers of the Percys. Marmaduke's father was in the service of King Edward IV in 1461, but by 1470 both Marmaduke and his father were in the service of Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland. Marmaduke campaigned with the Earl in Scotland in the early 1480s, and Northumberland knighted him at Berwick in August 1482. Marmaduke's epitaph states that he had been with Edward IV in France in 1475, perhaps under Northumberland.. By December 1483 Constable was a knight of the body to King Richard III, and was granted forfeited lands after Buckingham's rebellion. On 28 March 1484 the King granted him the constableship of Tutbury Castle, and other offices.. According to Horrox, it is unclear whether Constable fought for Richard III at Bosworth. In any case, he was not attainted, and was granted a pardon by Henry VII on 18 November 1485, was a knight of the body to the King by May 1486, and accompanied him to the wars in France in 1492.; . Constable succeeded his father in May 1488, and in November of that year became sheriff of Yorkshire. The first three years of Henry VII's reign were disrupted by risings in the North. Constable's brother-in-law, Sir Humphrey Stafford of Grafton, Worcestershire, was executed at Tyburn on 8 July 1486 for his involvement with Francis Lovell's rising in Yorkshire in 1586, and the Earl of Northumberland was killed by a Yorkshire mob in a rising in 1489. After Northumberland's death, Constable became an associate of Thomas Howard, then Earl of Surrey, who nominated him in 1509 to the Order of the Garter. In 1513 Constable commanded the left wing at the Battle of Flodden under Howard, for which service he received a letter of thanks from the King dated 26 November 1514 in which he is addressed as Sir Marmaduke Constable the elder, 'called the little'.; ; . Constable died on 10 November 1518 after swallowing a frog while drinking a glass of water. In the Church of St Oswald in Flamborough one may still read a rhyming epitaph describing his life and prowess.

In Canada, the term is used to refer to institutions that provide secondary education; while it was used to refer to post-secondary institutions in the United States. The term has fallen out of use throughout most of North America, although the Canadian province of Ontario, and select areas in Saskatchewan continue to use the term in the names of the secondary schools. Canada The term collegiate institute originally referred to a distinct type of secondary school in several provinces in Canada. However, the term has since transformed as a synonym for an institution that provides secondary education. The term is most prominent in Ontario, although the term is also used in several other areas in Canada. =Ontario= Galt Collegiate Institute and Vocational School was the first institution to be designated a Collegiate Institute by the province of Ontario. In Ontario, collegiate institute originally referred to a distinct type of secondary school within the province's parallel streams of secondary education. The parallel school system was not extended to the separate school systems in Ontario. After the parallel streams were merged into one stream, the term continues to see use in Ontario, used to refer to any secular public institution that provides secondary education. In 1871, the province of Ontario set up two parallel secondary education systems that included collegiate institutes and high school. Collegiate institutes offered education in the arts, classics, and the humanities, including Greek and Latin, for university-bound students. Conversely, high school referred to secondary institutions that offered vocational and science programs for those planning to enter the workforce upon graduation. While the parallel school system was in place, secondary institutions could only be elevated to the status of a collegiate institutes when it reached the prescribed number of teachers, and students; and when it fully complies with the standards set the Department of Education (renamed the Ministry of Education in 1972). Galt Collegiate and Vocational Institute was the first secondary institution elevated to a collegiate institute, in 1871. It was quite quickly realized that the division did not work very well. Over time, high schools responded to students' needs and increasingly offered the arts courses that were essential for the workforce. At the same time, as universities began teaching science and engineering, so did the collegiate institutes. Within a decade, the distinctions between the two systems were greatly blurred, and eventually, the two systems were merged in to a single secondary school system. In Ontario, after the merger of the two systems, the terms Collegiate Institute, High School, and Secondary School were all used in conjunction to refer to secondary educational institutions. The prominence of the term varies dependent on the area. In some school boards, including Lakehead District School Board, and Toronto District School Board, almost all secondary schools are named Collegiate Institute. Conversely, some school boards, like the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board, have no secondary school that use the term in its name. However, the majority of school boards in Ontario continue to use all three terms (Collegiate Institute, High School, and Secondary School) in the names of their secondary schools. =Other provinces= The term also saw use in Western Canada, with Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan adopting Ontario's parallel school system in the late-19th and early 20th centuries. However, after the parallel system was ended in those provinces, the majority of institutions that were designated as collegiate institutions were closed, or renamed. However, several secondary schools in Western Canada continue to use the term Collegiate Institute, including Lethbridge Collegiate Institute in Lethbridge, Alberta; Mennonite Brethren Collegiate Institute in Winnipeg, Manitoba; and Prince Albert Collegiate Institute in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. In the cities of Saskatoon, and Regina, the term survives as Collegiate, which is found in the names of most public secondary schools and some separate secondary schools in those two cities. That contrasts the rest of Saskatchewan, where the most common name for secondary school is High School. United States Pentecostal Collegiate Institute at the Rhode Island campus, c. 1905 In the United States, the term has largely fallen into disuse. Collegiate institutes in the United States were, for the most part, colleges, and even the first name of Yale University when founded in 1701 was a similar-sounding Collegiate School. However, the US definition of a college also differs from that of other countries and has been based primarily on the liberal arts college model of higher education. Two examples of collegiate institutes in the United States before the term fell out of use are the Oberlin Collegiate Institute of Ohio, now Oberlin College, and the Pentecostal Collegiate Institute of New York and Rhode Island, now the Eastern Nazarene College of Massachusetts. Both were founded as postsecondary institutions (in 1833 and 1900, respectively), but the latter would drop its college curriculum and exist as a college preparatory school from 1902 to 1918, which demonstrates the flexibility of the term collegiate institute. Partly because the term institute holds some ambiguity, many such schools would later change their names to use college instead of collegiate institute to represent their nature and mission more accurately, and the term \\"collegiate institute\\" would see little use after the early 20th century.

Each bridge is long with a long arch bridge spanning the shipping channel. The northern bridge was built in 1983, and the southern opened in 1992. A delay occurred during the construction of the southern bridge when a crane dropped a section of it into the river and it had to be rebuilt. The original Jefferson Barracks Bridge was a steel truss toll bridgeMap of the Missouri State Highway System as of January 1, 1953 that carried U.S. Route 50. Construction on that bridge began on August 5, 1942, and it opened two years later. A toll was charged until 1959, when the construction bonds were paid off. Prior to the construction of the original bridge, river crossings in this area were made via the Davis Street Ferry in the Carondelet neighborhood of St. Louis. The current bridge carries traffic for both Interstate 255 (part of the St. Louis beltway) and U.S. Route 50. However, I-255 itself was not built until a few years after the northern bridge opened in 1983. The names comes from the nearby Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery, itself originally part of the large Jefferson Barracks military complex, established in 1826 and decommissioned in 1946.

Twenty Grand won the Wood Memorial Stakes, Kentucky Derby, Belmont Stakes, Dwyer Stakes, Travers Stakes, Saratoga Cup, and the Jockey Club Gold Cup. In his only blemish of the year, Twenty Grand just missed the Triple Crown, finishing second to Mate in the Preakness. He went off as the post time favorite at 3:2. Mate, his stablemate, was sent to the front early, followed by Clock Tower. As Twenty Grand tried to pass the leaders on the clubhouse turn, he was bumped badly by Clock Tower. Twenty Grand was knocked off his stride but recovered. Down the back stretch and around the final turn, he made up ground on Ladder and Mate. His jockey, Charlie Kurtsinger, chose the rail and went inside, but the tiring Mate blocked Twenty Grand and held on to win by a half length. Twenty Grand's performances in 1931 earned him retrospective American Horse of the Year honors.

He was also the first Mountaineer to post back-to-back 100 yard receiving games. In 1974, he was selected to play in the Hula Bowl and the Senior Bowl, helping the East top the West with a touchdown in the Hula Bowl. He ranks fourth in career receiving yards with 1,796 and touchdown receptions with 15 and holds the West Virginia record for most career yards per reception with a 20.9 average. He is often considered one of the greatest receivers in West Virginia University football history, along with greats such as Reggie Rembert, Jerry Porter, and Chris Henry. Professional career =NFL= Buggs was drafted by the New York Giants in the third round of the 1975 NFL Draft. He played two seasons in New York, 1975 and 1976. The Giants cut Buggs partway through the 1976 season, and the Washington Redskins signed him. In his six games with the Redskins in 1976, he caught two passes for 25 yards. The next season, 1977 he had 26 receptions for 341 yards and a touchdown. With the NFL's then-all-time leading receiver, Charley Taylor, retired following the 1977 season after playing for the Redskins for 14 seasons, Buggs broke out in 1978 with 36 receptions for 575 yards and two touchdowns. In his final NFL season, 1979, Buggs totaled 46 receptions for 631 yards and a touchdown while playing all 16 games for the first time in his career. On April 29, 1980, Buggs was traded along with a fourth round pick (Larry Flowers) in the 1980 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for cornerback Jeris White. Buggs was traded to make room for the Redskins' first round selection, future Hall of Famer Art Monk, the first time Washington did not trade its first round pick since 1968.Redskins satisfied with draft Free Lance-Star, accessed March 31, 2012 He attended the Buccaneers' training camp, but was cut on September 1, 1980.Garo Drops In For Lunch Evening Independent, accessed March 31, 2012 On June 23, 1981, Buggs signed with the Houston Oilers and he was with the team until August 25, 1981.Montreal signs ex-Oiler The Windsor Star, accessed March 31, 2012 =CFL and USFL= Buggs played in the CFL from 1980 to 1982.

It is located between Portland International Raceway on the west and Interstate 5 on the east and is at the north end of the Vanport Bridge, which spans the Columbia Slough and an industrial area. The station platforms are to the sides of the tracks. Beyond them are two park and ride lots to the west and bus bays connected to an I-5 off-ramp to the east. As of 2018, one C-Tran bus route and one TriMet bus route serve this station. Artwork at the station references the 1948 Vanport Flood, even utilizing bronzed artifacts found on the construction site. Bus line connections Three C-Tran buses at the station As of 2018, Delta Park/Vanport MAX station is served by two bus routes: *TriMet route 6 - Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. (southbound trips only) *C-Tran route 60 - Delta Park Limited (operating all day, seven days a week) =Bus service history= When the station opened in 2004, there was no regular bus service to it; however, C-Tran did use the bus bays during winter storms instead of providing through service to downtown Portland.

He is best remembered as a Marxist cultural essayist and as the long-time editor of The Communist, later known as Political Affairs, the theoretical journal of the Communist Party USA. He was known as the Chairman of the party's Cultural Commission, based in New York. Early years (Jerome) Isaac Roman, also known by the surname \\"Romain\\" and better known by the pseudonym \\"Victor Jeremy Jerome,\\" was born into a Jewish family in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ or Stryk√≥w, Poland, then part of the Russian Empire, on October 12, 1896. After his parents emigrated to London, he lived with relatives in Poland until they were ready for him to join them at age nine.Yale University Library, \\"V. J. Jerome--Biographical Note\\", Modern American Poetry He lived for about ten years in England with his family. According to the 1911 Census of England, a 14-year-old resident Russian alien named Isaac Roman, the son of Harris and Dinah Roman, lived with his parents and brother Nathan at 52 Lucas Street, Commercial Road, Stepney, London; his father Harris Roman was a tailor (baster). As a young man, Isaac Roman emigrated at the age of 18 to the United States, and was recorded on the passenger list of the S/S St. Louis as a Hebrew (Jewish) tailor. The ship sailed from the Port of Liverpool, England, on July 24, 1915, and arrived at the Port of New York, August 1, 1915. He identified his next of kin as Mr. and Mrs. Roman, of 32 Oxford Street, Stepney, London. His destination was listed as a friend residing at 155 South Second Avenue, Brooklyn, New York. Roman attended City College of New York for higher education. He left college after marrying Frances Winwar; they had a child together before they divorced. He did not finish college then, but began work as a bookkeeper for the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union in the early 1920s. This experience with the working class helped to radicalize him. In 1928, he officially changed his name by court order from Roman Jerome Isaac to \\"Jerome Isaac Romain.\\" Political career In 1924, Romain joined the Communist Party. In 1925, he married Rose Pastor Stokes, a writer and activist who was also of Polish Jewish ancestry and was seventeen years older than he. She had been married for 20 years to J.G. Phelps Stokes, a wealthy Episcopalian businessman in New York who supported a settlement house and other philanthropic ventures. They finally divorced over political differences; she was an advocate for birth control and political activism. Romain returned to college and in 1930, he received a Bachelor of Science degree from New York University. Stokes died of breast cancer in 1933 at the age of 53. Romain moved to Hollywood for a year to raise money for the Spanish Loyalists, or Republicans. Returning to New York in 1935, he became editor of The Communist, writing under the pseudonym V. J. Jerome. This magazine later became known in 1944 as Political Affairs. He served as its editor until 1955. In 1937, he married Alice Hamburger. Jerome, as he was known, was among the cultural spokesmen of the American Communist Party. He rose in the party hierarchy in the mid-1930s. Membership grew during the economic upheaval and trials of the Great Depression. Between 1935 and 1965, Jerome wrote constantly. He wrote two autobiographical novels, A Lantern for Jeremy (released during the \\"Foley Square Trials\\" in 1952), and its sequel, The Paper Bridge (published posthumously in 1966). He also published a collection of vignettes, Unstill Waters (1964). A prolific writer, he created short stories, plays, and literary, and art criticism. But he is best known for his political and cultural essays, such as \\"The Intellectuals and the War\\" (1940), \\"Culture in a Changing World\\" (1948), and \\"The Negro in Hollywood Films\\" (1950). During this period he was chairman of the Party's Cultural Commission and was \\"considered a bluntly dogmatic thinker,\\" serving a role in the US similar to that of Zhdanov in the Soviet Union. In the postwar period, Congress and local governments reacted to the Cold War with investigations of communist activity. Jerome was prosecuted and convicted under the Smith Act for committing the \\"overt act\\" of conspiracy to teach and encourage overthrow of the US government through his pamphlet, \\"Grasp the Weapon of Culture\\", which he presented as a report to the Communist Party in 1950. He recommended that the Party consider art and entertainment part of its \\"mass work\\". He was indicted in 1951, together with 16 other Communist leaders, during a second wave of trials of communist leaders that took place across the country. The first trial was conducted in New York in 1947. During a nine-month trial in New York's federal Foley Square Courthouse, Jerome passed the long hours in court writing poetry and reading page proofs of his memoir, A Lantern for Jeremy. He was convicted and sentenced in 1953 to three years at Lewisburg Penitentiary, which he served between 1955 and 1957. Shortly before going to prison, he resigned from Political Affairs, complaining that the Party made decisions without him.John Munro, The Anticolonial Front: The African American Freedom Struggle and Global Decolonisation, 1945‚Äì1960, Cambridge University Press, 2017, pp. 115‚Äì116 Following his release, Jerome spent 1958 in Poland. After that he worked for two years in Moscow as an editor of a collection of Vladimir Lenin's works. He returned to the US and began writing a novel based on the life of Spinoza.

It can be translated into English as \\"rule of law\\", alternatively \\"legal state\\", \\"state of law\\", \\"state of justice\\", or \\"state based on justice and integrity\\".The word also occurs, with the same meaning, in Dutch. A Rechtsstaat is a \\"constitutional state\\" in which the exercise of governmental power is constrained by the law.Carl Schmitt, The Concept of the Political, ch. 7; Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy It is closely related to \\"constitutionalism\\" while is often tied to the Anglo-American concept of the rule of law, but differs from it in that it also emphasizes what is just (i.e., a concept of moral rightness based on ethics, rationality, law, natural law, religion, or equity). Thus it is the opposite of Obrigkeitsstaat or Nichtrechtsstaat (a state based on the arbitrary use of power),The Legal Doctrines of the Rule of Law and the Legal State (Rechtsstaat). Editors: Silkenat, James R., Hickey Jr., James E., Barenboim, Peter D. (Eds.), Springer, 2014 and of Unrechtsstaat (a non-Rechtsstaat with the capacity to become one after a period of historical development). In a Rechtsstaat, the power of the state is limited in order to protect citizens from the arbitrary exercise of authority. The citizens share legally based civil liberties and can use the courts. Immanuel Kant German writers usually place the theories of German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724‚Äì1804) at the beginning of their accounts of the movement toward the Rechtsstaat. Kant did not use the word Rechtsstaat, but contrasted an existing state (Staat) with an ideal, constitutional state (Republik). His approach is based on the supremacy of a country's written constitution. This supremacy must create guarantees for implementation of his central idea: a permanent peaceful life as a basic condition for the happiness of its people and their prosperity. Kant proposed that this happiness be guaranteed by a moral constitution agreed on by the people and thus, under it, by moral government. The actual expression Rechtsstaat appears to have been introduced by Carl Theodor Welcker in 1813, but it was popularised by Robert von Mohl's book Die deutsche Polizeiwissenschaft nach den Grunds√§tzen des Rechtsstaates (\\"German Policy Science according to the Principles of the Constitutional State\\"; 1832‚Äì33). Von Mohl contrasted government through policy with government, in a Kantian spirit, under general rules. In this context Polizei means \\"policy\\", not \\"police\\": Stewart, 2007. Principles of the Rechtsstaat GG) The most important principles of the Rechtsstaat are:Klaus Stern, Das Staatsrecht der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, I 2nd edition, ¬ß 20, Munich 1984, ; Reinhold Zippelius, Allgemeine Staatslehre/Politikwissenschaft, 16th edition, ¬ß¬ß 8 II, 30-34, Munich 2010, * The state is based on the supremacy of national constitution and guarantees the safety and constitutional rights of its citizens * Civil society is an equal partner to the state * Separation of powers, with the executive, legislative, and judiciary branches of government limiting one another's power and providing for checks and balances * The judicature and the executive are bound by law (not acting against the law), and the legislature is bound by constitutional principles * Both the legislature and democracy itself are bound by elementary constitutional rights and principles * Transparency of state acts and the requirement of providing a reason for all state acts * Review of state decisions and state acts by independent organs, including an appeal process * Hierarchy of laws and the requirement of clarity and definiteness * Reliability of state actions, protection of past dispositions made in good faith against later state actions, prohibition of retroactivity * Principle of the proportionality of state action Russian model of Rechtsstaat: a concept of the legal state The Russian legal system, borne out of transformations in the 19th century under the reforms of Emperor Alexander II, is based primarily on the German legal tradition. It was from here that Russia borrowed a doctrine of Rechtsstaat, which literally translates as \\"legal state\\". The concept of \\"legal state\\" (') is a fundamental (but undefined) principle that appears in the very first dispositive provision of Russia's post-Communist constitution: \\"The Russian Federation ‚Äì Russia ‚Äì constitutes a democratic federative legal state with a republican form of governance.\\" Similarly, the first dispositive provision of Ukraine's Constitution declares: \\"Ukraine is a sovereign and independent, democratic, social, legal state.\\" The effort to give meaning to the expression \\"legal state\\" is anything but theoretical. Valery Zorkin, President of the Constitutional Court of Russia, wrote in 2003: The Russian concept of legal state adopted many elements of constitutional economics. Constitutional economics is a field of economics and constitutionalism that describes and analyzes the specific interrelationships between constitutional issues and functioning of the economy, including the budget process. The term \\"constitutional economics\\" was used by American economist James M. Buchanan as a name for a new academic sub-discipline that in 1986 brought him the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his \\"development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision- making.\\" According to Buchanan, the ethic of constitutionalism is a key for constitutional order and \\"may be called the idealized Kantian world\\" where the individual \\"who is making the ordering, along with substantially all of his fellows, adopts the moral law as a general rule for behaviour\\".James Buchanan, The Logical Foundations of Constitutional Liberty, Volume 1, Liberty Fund, Indianapolis, 1999, p. 314. Buchanan rejects \\"any organic conception of the state as superior in wisdom, to the individuals who are its members.\\" He believes that a constitution, intended for use by at least several generations of citizens, must be able to adjust itself for pragmatic economic decisions and to balance interests of the state and society against those of individuals and their constitutional rights to personal freedom and private happiness.Buchanan Entry at Nobel site The standards of constitutional economics when used during annual budget planning, as well as the latter's transparency to the civil society, are of primary importance to the implementation of the rule of law. Moreover, the availability of an effective court system, to be used by the civil society in situations of unfair government spending and executive impoundment of any previously authorized appropriations, becomes a key element for the success of any influential civil society.Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova. \\"The 25th Anniversary of Constitutional Economics: The Russian Model and Legal Reform in Russia, in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform\\", edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007). Some Russian researchers support an idea that, in the 21st century, the concept of the legal state has become not only a legal but also an economic concept, at least for Russia and many other transitional and developing countries.

The band's name came from the members' early sustenance of food samples from the local King Soopers grocery store. The music has been described as \\"reggae influenced rock/pop\\" and a cross between The Police and the Grateful Dead. The founding members were Sean Kelly (Guitar/Vocals), Charles Hambleton (Guitar), Andy Sheldon (Bass/Vocals), Jeep MacNichol (Drums/Vocals), and Al Laughlin (Keyboards/Vocals). History Singer/songwriter Sean Kelly and guitarist Charles Hambleton met in 1985 in Burlington, Vermont at an open mic called The Sheik, leading to the formation of the band Secret City in 1986. After playing together in Burlington for a year, the pair moved to Boulder, CO and met up with Andy Sheldon, a friend and member of a prior band with Kelly. Jeep MacNichol joined the band as drummer after responding to an ad. After playing around the area, Al Laughlin saw the group perform at a frat party and asked if the group needed a keyboardist, an offer the band accepted. The band played their first show in Colorado on April 19, 1987 at Tulagi's, a Boulder venue. Later that year, the band recorded a demo album on cassette that was never officially released. The recording of \\"Moonlit Treese\\" made it onto the Underwater People EP, while several other tracks can be found online. The Samples embarked on their first national tour in the summer of 1988 and gradually gained attention. The band played mostly to college audiences and allowed their music to be spread through bootlegging and taping. Fans in college towns formed street teams to distribute the band's music and help them get shows by popular demand. Their debut self-titled album The Samples was independently recorded with producer Walt Beery and was released independently in early 1989. The album combined reggae, pop-rock, and bluegrass with a tight and polished sound that was often compared to The Police. Following the release, they signed with Arista Records and re-released the same album in May. However, the band found itself at odds with Arista's personnel, who neglected to market their debut album and wanted to change their sound. After an unproductive studio session with an outside producer hired by the label, band terminated their contract with Arista in the fall of 1991 and continued to tour unsigned. Also that year, Hambleton departed the band. He would later appear in Pirates of the Caribbean and was associate producer of the film The Cove. The Samples continued to tour and released their own self-published EP, Underwater People, composed of both studio-recorded and live tracks. The band soon joined the newly formed independent label, W.A.R.? - What Are Records? and released No Room in 1992. The album was produced by Jim Scott and showed the band's continuing growth as songwriters and musicians. Many of the songs on No Room became their most well-known, including \\"When it's Raining\\", \\"Did Ya Ever Look So Nice\\", and \\"Taking Us Home\\". The album's sound combined pop sensibility with a mix of folk, reggae, jazz, and rock that would become their signature. Sean Kelly, as the main songwriter, wrote songs about nature and the environment giving the band an \\"eco-friendly\\" reputation. Sheldon's thumping bass, MacNichol's Stewart Copeland-inspired beats and Laughlin's off- beat reggae chords supported Kelly's inspired songwriting and Sting-like vocals. They became a success throughout the early 1990s, selling over one million copies of their catalogue based on a genuine grassroots campaign. Their live shows helped them on the college circuit selling out venues in college towns across the country. In 1993, The Samples released The Last Drag, produced by Marc DeSisto. At the time of its release, the band considered it to be a reinvention of itself. This album marked a shift in their sound to a more guitar-driven, pop-oriented approach. Though many tracks still had elements of reggae and world music, songs such as \\"Streets in the Rain\\" and \\"Everytime\\" featured more streamlined productions and opened the band to wider audiences. It featured more of Andy Sheldon's songs than on previous albums and included singing/songwriting contributions from Jeep MacNichol and Al Laughlin for the first time on a studio album. Sean Kelly has referred to their increasing contributions as \\"solo projects within the band\\". Around this time, the band headlined some of the H.O.R.D.E. tour shows in 1993 and 1996 and they shared the bill with big names such as The Allman Brothers Band, Blues Traveler, and Phish. On their own tours, many up and coming bands opened up for them including Dave Matthews Band, Hootie & the Blowfish, and Lisa Loeb. The success included television performances on The Tonight Show and House of Blues. The band took the summer of 1994 off while Sean Kelly recorded his first and only solo album, Lighthouse Rocket. In the fall, The Samples returned with Autopilot, produced by Walt Beery who also became their manager around this time. They chose the album's name because the band had gone straight into the studio after a long tour and was able to perform on \\"autopilot\\" without much preparation, according to MacNichol. Autopilot was more concise than previous albums and focused on capturing the band's live sound. In 1995, The Samples' contract with W.A.R. had expired, so they decided to approach major labels with their catalog to move forward. The band signed with MCA Records and released Outpost, their fifth studio album, in 1996. It featured a heavier, more stripped-down sound and included re-recordings of early songs \\"Did You Ever Look So Nice\\" and \\"Birth of Words\\". Although it was their most expensive album to record, costing over $300,000, the band was disappointed with the result due to inconsistent guidance from label personnel and high creative tensions within the band. Because of a buyout, MCA was experiencing financial difficulties and significant corporate reshuffling. As a result, many small or recently signed bands were dropped from the label around the same time. The personnel who had signed The Samples were no longer there, and MCA terminated The Samples' contract in 1997 after a short-lived tour with Jars of Clay and a few dates opening for Sting. Laughlin was absent for much of the Outpost sessions and tour while he was recovering from a heroin addiction, and decided to leave the band for good that year. MacNichol also departed, due to disagreement over direction during the Outpost sessions and the desire to start a solo career. He would later release three grunge- influenced albums under the name \\"Jeep\\", as well as his current reggae/dub project \\"Mr. Anonymous\\". The original lineup did a short farewell tour and played its last show on May 14, 1997 at the Bluebird Theater, with Charles Hambleton joining them as a special guest. The Samples' future was in limbo with Sean Kelly and Andy Sheldon facing the decision of whether or not to continue under the same name. However, they promptly reformed with new members Kenny James, Alex Matson, and Rob Somers, and rejoined What Are Records? to release Transmissions from the Sea of Tranquility in late 1997, a live album with some tracks recorded on tour and others recorded at an empty venue. The new lineup led to the band developing a mellower sound echoing Kelly's folk- rock influences from the 1970s. Here and Somewhere Else followed in 1998. Only two months later, the band released the semi-concept album The Tan Mule, an Internet-only collection of tracks described by Kelly as \\"kind of western\\" and a \\"cultish, fan thing\\" The project had been started prior to Here and Somewhere Else in order to fulfill a contract obligation to their management company. The band intended the album to be bad enough in order to get themselves released from their ill-conceived management contract, but still good enough to not be a total loss. Nevertheless, they were released from their contract, and The Tan Mule was well received by fans. The band began to release albums independently, beginning with 2001's \\"Return to Earth\\", which featured new drummer Sam Young. Return to Earth was, in some ways, a return to form for the band; it mostly relied on eclectic uptempo songs and received perhaps the warmest reception from fans since Autopilot. In 2003, Andy Sheldon left the band. Since then, there have been numerous member changes with the exception of Sean Kelly as frontman and only remaining original member. Sean Kelly and long-time Samples acoustic guitarist Tom Askin released the acoustic \\"Seventeen\\" Album/DVD in 2003. The Samples returned in 2004 with the mostly fan-funded \\"Black and White\\", and in 2005 with \\"Rehearsing for Life\\". \\"America\\" was released in 2014, and in 2019 The Samples released \\"Indian Summer\\". The Samples original lineup at Mile High Music Festival 2010 with (left to right) Sean Kelly, Jeep MacNichol, John Popper, and Charles Hambleton In 2008, an announcement appeared on The Samples's website indicating that the band was unlikely to continue. However, Kelly resumed playing shows under The Samples name with new members in 2009. The Colorado Rapids Soccer Club's Game Entertainment Dept. reunited the original five-piece lineup for an in-stadium concert on July 4, 2009 as part of the state's largest Independence Day celebration that year, at Dick's Sporting Goods Park. This was followed by the reunited band again playing at the same stadium for the Mile High Music Festival in 2010. The newest lineup played the Denver Day of Rock in 2011 and have continued to tour with many more dates planned for the future. A biopic documentary about the band titled The Best Band You've Never Heard was produced in 2012 by Besame films. It is currently only available on YouTube. The song \\"Could It Be Another Change\\" from the band's debut album was used in the 2012 film The Perks of Being a Wallflower. In June 2013, The Samples returned to the studio to begin working on a new album. Their eleventh studio album, America, was released New Year's Day, 2014. The album features contributions from Richie Furay and SHEL. On December 12, 2014, the original lineup of The Samples reunited for the second time at the Fillmore Auditorium in Denver, CO. The band played their self-titled debut album in its entirety, along with a second set of fan favorites.

It connects northern portions of the city of St. Louis, Missouri with Venice, Illinois. It opened in 1910 and was taken out of service on October 30, 2001. The bridge was reopened for pedestrian and bicyclists on November 17, 2007 with a grand re-opening celebration. Since December 2007, McKinley has been open to vehicular traffic as well. It is accessible from Illinois State Route 3 in Illinois and from the intersection of Salisbury and North 9th Street in the City of St. Louis. The bridge carried both railroad and vehicular traffic across the Mississippi River for decades. By 1978, the railroad line over the span was closed, and an additional set of lanes was opened for vehicles in the inner roadway. The McKinley Bridge was the first alignment of U.S. Route 66 across the Mississippi. It is commonly assumed that the bridge was named for President William McKinley; but in reality, it was named for the builder, William B. McKinley, chief executive of the Illinois Traction System interurban electric railway, which accessed St. Louis via the bridge.  Usage  The current alignment of the bridge carries two lanes of traffic on the inner lanes. The outer lane on the north side of the bridge will become an exclusive service lane, while the outer lane on the south side of the bridge will become a sidewalk and bike path. It is expected to carry 14,000 vehicles across the river daily, but total traffic across the river increased in 2014 by 7.4% over 2013 levels, and in April 2014, it was estimated that 17,000 vehicles use it daily.  History  The designer of the bridge was Polish- American engineer Ralph Modjeski.Glomb, Jozef; Peter J. Obst (Translator) (2002) (in English). A man who spanned two eras: The story of bridge engineer Ralph Modjeski. Philadelphia: Kosciuszko Foundation. . It was constructed by Missouri Valley Bridge & Iron Co. and Pennsylvania Steel Co. When the US Highway System was instituted in 1926, the McKinley Bridge carried the famous Route 66 across the Mississippi River for four years until a new alignment took the route over Chain of Rocks Bridge in order to avoid leading traffic directly into the downtown St. Louis area. The Chain of Rocks Bridge was famous for having a curve in the middle. It is now open to pedestrians. The bridge was owned by the city of Venice, Illinois and operated as a toll bridge. After decades of disrepair due to the lack of toll revenues, the McKinley Bridge was closed in 2001. The state of Illinois attempted to provide money to the city of Venice for repairing the bridge, but was unable to do so because of the outstanding taxes owed by the city. As a result, the City of St. Louis foreclosed on the bridge, delaying reconstruction efforts further. In an agreement reached in June 2003, the states of Illinois and Missouri agreed to take over ownership of the bridge from the city of Venice. Rehabilitation began in 2004 and the original plans for the repairs anticipated a re-opening in late 2005. However, the date was pushed back due to the addition of The Great Rivers Greenway Bikeway tie-in. The rehabilitated McKinley Bridge consists of the three original river truss spans (Spans 26-29, long each) and thirty-three steel plate girder spans, with a length totaling The Bridge reopened to pedestrians and bicycles on November 17, 2007 and was fully reopened to traffic on December 17, 2007.

Unlike wolves who hunt in packs, amaroks hunt alone. Writing in the 19th century, Danish geologist and Greenlandic scholar Hinrich Johannes Rink reported that the Greenlandic Inuit reserve the word Amarok exclusively for this legendary wolf, whereas other Arctic peoples use it to refer to any wolf. Tales and Traditions of the Eskimo In his book Tales and Traditions of the Eskimo, (1866) Rink recounts several folk legends that feature the Amarok. In one tale, a persecuted and physically stunted boy seeks to increase his strength. When he calls out to the lord of strength, an Amarok appears and wrestles him to the ground with its tail. This causes a number of small bones to fall from the boy's body. The Amarok tells the boy that the bones had prevented his growth; he instructs the boy to return daily in order to develop his strength. After several days of wrestling with the amarok, the boy is strong enough to overcome three large bears, thus gaining him the esteem of his village. In another story, a man mourning the death of a relative hears reports that an Amarok is nearby. He and a relative go in search of the Amarok. They find instead her pups, and the mourner kills them all. The mourner's relative becomes frightened. The two retreat to hide in a cave. Looking out, they see the adult Amarok returning to her pups, carrying a reindeer in her mouth. When the Amarok fails to find her offspring, she hastens to a nearby lake and drags a humanoid form from the water; at that moment, the mourner collapses. The Amarok, \\"from which nothing remains concealed\\", took the mourner's soul from his body. In some tales, a person captures or kills an amarok. The myth of the Amarok was most likely originated from the tale ancient Eskimos told about direwolves.

The text was likely composed in the Assam region of India. It exists in many versions, variously organized in 90 to 93 chapters. The surviving versions of the text are unusual in that they start abruptly and follow a format not found in either the major or minor Purana- genre mythical texts of Hinduism. This text in attributed to sage Markendeya, and starts off with the legends of Devi trying to bring Shiva back from ascetic life into householder's life by making him fall in love again. According to Ludo Rocher, Markendeya describes how Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu are \\"one and the same\\" and that all goddesses (Sati, Parvati, Menaka, Kali and others) are manifestation of the same feminine energy. It glorifies the goddess Kamakhya, or Kamakshi and details the ritual procedures required for worshiping her. It also describes in detail the rivers and mountains at Kamarupa tirtha and mentions the Brahmaputra River and the Kamakhya Temple. Chapters 67 through 78 of the text constitute the Rudhiradhyaya which discusses bali (animal sacrifice) and of Vamacara Tantrism. The Rudhiradhyaya section is notable for its uncommon discussion of human sacrifice. The text states that a human sacrifice may be performed to please the goddess, but only with the consent of prince before a war or cases of imminent danger. The text also states that anyone who is physically handicapped, related to a Brahmin, or \\"is not willing to die\\" through the sacrifice is unfit for the ritual. The text describes the rituals associated with a bali, or a rice-paste substitute for enemies prior to a war, but does not describe how the sacrifice was actually done. The work belongs to the goddess-oriented Shakta branch of Hinduism. Most probably it was composed in or near medieval Kamarupa (modern Assam). It is a late work, states Hazra, by Nibandha writers regarding Shakti worship.Hazra, R.C. (1962, reprint 2003). \\"The Upapuranas\\" in S. Radhakrishnan (ed.) The Cultural Heritage of India, Vol.II, Kolkata: The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, , p.280 It is also one of the rare Hindu texts that actually mentions the word \\"Hindu\\". Date According to Hazra, there existed a text that was older than the extant one, and that the origin of that text was Bengal. This is denied by Shastri, who claims that the evidence provided by Hazra for an earlier text can be explained by other means, without invoking an older text. According to Shastri, the local descriptions; the exposition of the myth of Naraka from who all the dynasties of Kamarupa drew their lineage; the description of the myth of Brahmaputra river; and the claim in the text that Kamarupa was holier than even Varanasi points to the text having been composed in Kamarupa. References to KƒÅlidƒÅsa and Magha suggests that it is not one of the early Puranas. The mention of places and events associated with Ratna Pala (920-960) of Kamrupa region places the text to after the 10th- century. The explanation in the text for the Mlechchha population, and the indication of a parallel explanation in Harjaravarman's (815-832) Hyunthal copper plate inscription places the text closer to his reign. According to Rocher, the mention of king Dharmapala of Kamarupa has led to proposals of Kalika Purana being an 11th or 12th-century text. However, estimates for different sections of the text range from 7th to end of 11th-century. Printed editions The earliest printed edition of this text was published by the Venkateshvara Press, Bombay in 1829 Saka Era (1907 CE), followed by the Vangavasi Press, Calcutta in 1316 Bangabda (1909 CE).

History  Sh≈çgun Ashikaga Yoshimasa, who developed the Higashiyama culture (painting by Tosa Mitsunobu, latter half of 15th century) Based largely on the ideals and aesthetics of Zen Buddhism and the concept of wabi- sabi, Higashiyama culture centered on the development of chad≈ç (Japanese tea ceremony), ikebana (flower arranging), Noh drama, and sumi-e ink painting. Much of what is commonly seen today as traditional Japanese culture originated or developed in this period. Higashiyama culture is often contrasted with , the \\"Kitayama Culture\\" from earlier in the Muromachi period. In this comparison Kinkaku-ji, representative of Kitayama culture is compared with Ginkaku-ji, representative of Higashiyama culture. Interior of the Kuri, the main building of the Ry≈çan-ji, featuring elements of traditional Japanese style culture such as washitsu (fusuma, tatami, and sh≈çji) which were stylized in the Higashiyama culture Yoshimasa's retirement villa was turned into the temple Ginkaku-ji (the Temple of the Silver Pavilion) after his death. It is situated in Kyoto's Saky≈ç-ku, and was the center of the Higashiyama cultural outgrowth in a number of ways. The Pavilion is revered for its simple beauty, the silver having never been added. The rock garden next to it is likewise one of the most famous in Japan, and praised for its Zen and wabi-sabi aesthetics. It is a quintessential example of the idea that only the trained expert should be able to recognize the subtle beauty within art and architecture; the beauty of the object should not be underscored and emphasized, but gently hidden. The retired shogun also invited many artists, poets, and court nobles to his villa, encouraging the development of their arts. A vast and priceless collection of artifacts came together, which was known as the Higashiyama Treasure. The T≈çgud≈ç building includes a shoin-style room called the D≈çjinsai. It originally had a fireplace built into the floor, and due to this, the D≈çjinsai is considered the earliest extant example of a room designed for use as a tea room.Yasuhiko Murai, tr. Alfred Birnbaum, \\"A Brief History of Tea in Japan.\\" Chapter One in CHANOYU: The Urasenke Tradition of Tea. Weatherhill, 1988. There were many architectural innovations in this period, exhibited in the Ginkaku-ji in particular, which would later become core elements in the shoin style of 17th century architecture. One of these elements was the tokonoma, a small alcove in which scrolls are hung, and flowers or other small articles are placed to enhance the aesthetic feel of the room. The great ink- painter Sessh≈´ T≈çy≈ç spent much time at the Ginkaku-ji, and this period also saw the birth of the Kan≈ç school of Japanese painting as well as an early version of chanoyu tea ceremony. Tea ceremony would be further formalized by Sen no Riky≈´ in the 16th century.

It plays an important role in carcinogenesis. The conversion of nicotine to NNK entails opening of the pyrrolidine ring. Synthesis and occurrence NNK can be produced by standard methods of organic synthesis. =Tobacco= NNK is both found in cured tobacco and is produced during its burning (pyrolysis). The amount of NNK delivered in cigarette smoke ranged from 30 to 280 ng/cigarette in one study and 12 to 110 ng/cigarette in another. Sun-cured tobaccos (a.k.a. \\"Oriental\\") contain very little NNK and other TSNAs due to low-nitrate soil, lack of nitrate fertilizer, and sun-curing. Flue-cured tobacco (a.k.a. \\"Virginia\\" tobaccohttp://www.pmi.com/eng/our_products/pages/about_tobacco.aspx), especially when using an open flame, contains most of the NNK in American blended tobaccos although Marlboro's \\"virginia blend\\" had the lowest levels of NNK per nicotine out of many tested with the exception of Natural American Spirit. =e-Cigarettes= e-Cigarette do not convert nicotine to NNK due to their lower operating temperatures. The amount of NNK delivered by e-cigarettes reaches 2.8 ng per 15 puffs (approximately 1 cigarette). NNK was found in 89% of Korean e-cigarette liquids. Concentrations range from 0.22 to 9.84 ¬µg/L. For the product that had the highest amount, if 1 ml is equival to 20 cigarettes,http://www.electroniccigaretteconsumerreviews.com/how-much- nicotine-is-in-one-cigarette/ there would be 9.84/20 = 0.5 ng NNK per e-cig cigarette dose. Cigarettes with 1 gram of tobacco average about 350 ng.  Biology  = Metabolism = NNK is initially a procarcinogen that needs activation to exert its effects. The activation of NNK is done by enzymes of the cytochrome pigment (CYP) multigene family. These enzymes catalyze hydroxylation reactions. Beside the CYP family NNK can also be activated by metabolic genes, like myeloperoxidase (MPO) and epoxide hydrolase (EPHX1). NNK can be activated by two different routes, the oxidative path and the reductive path. In the oxidative metabolism NNK undergoes an Œ±-hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P450. This reaction can be done by two pathways namely by Œ±-methylhydroxylation or by Œ±-methylenehydroxylation. Both pathways produce the carcinogenic metabolized isoform of NNK, NNAL. In the reductive metabolism NNK undergoes either a carbonyl reduction or a pyridine N-oxidation, both producing NNAL. NNAL can be detoxified by glucuronidation producing a non- carcinogenic compounds known as NNAL-Glucs. The glucuronidation can take place on the oxygen next to the ring (NNAL-O-Gluc), or it takes place on the nitrogen inside the ring(NNAL-N-Gluc). The NNAL-Glucs are then excreted by the kidneys into the urine. = Signaling pathways = Once NNK is activated, NNK initiates a cascade of signaling pathways (for example ERK1/2, NFŒ∫B, PI3K/Akt, MAPK, FasL, K-ras), resulting in uncontrolled cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis. NNK activates ¬µ en m-calpain kinase which induce lung metastasis via the ERK1/2 pathway. This pathway upregulate cellular myelocytomatosis (c-Myc) and B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) in which the two oncoprotein are involved in cellular proliferation, transformation and apoptosis. Also does NNK promotes cell survival via phosphorylation with cooperation of c-Myc and Bcl2 causing cellular migration, invasion and uncontrolled proliferation. The ERK1/2 pathway also phosphorylate NFŒ∫B causing an upregulation of cyclin D1, a G1 phase regulator protein. When NNK is present it directly involves cellular survival dependent on NFŒ∫B. Further studies are needed to better understand NNK cellular pathyways of NFŒ∫B. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/Akt) pathway is also an important contributor to NNK-induced cellular transformations and metastasis. This process ensures the proliferation and survival of tumorigenic cells. The ERK1/2 and Akt pathways show consequential changes in levels of protein expression as a result of NNK-activation in the cells, but further research is needed to fully understand the mechanism of NNK-activated pathways.  Pathology  = Toxicity = NNK is known as a mutagen, which means it causes polymorphisms in the human genome. Studies showed that NNK induced gene polymorphisms in cells that involve in cell growth, proliferation and differentiation. There are multiple NNK dependent routes that involve cell proliferation. One example is the cell route that coordinates the downregulation of retinoic acid receptor beta (RAR-Œ≤). Studies showed that with a 100 mg/kg dose of NNK, several point mutations were formed in the RAR-Œ≤ gene, inducing tumorigenesis in the lungs. Other genes affected by NNK include sulfotransferase 1A1 (SULT1A1), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Œ≤), and angiotensin II (AT2). NNK plays a very important role in gene silencing, modification, and functional disruption which induce carcinogenesis. = Inhibition = Chemical compounds derived from cruciferous vegetables and EGCG inhibit lung tumorigenesis by NNK in animal models. Whether these effects have any relevance to human health is unknown and is a subject of ongoing research.

Helxine soleirolii) is a plant in the nettle family. It has a number of common names, including baby's tears, angel's tears, bits and pieces, bread and cheese, Corsican creeper, Corsican curse, friendship plant, mind-your-own-business, mother of thousands, Paddy's wig, and pollyanna vine. It has also been called Irish moss; however, it is not a moss, nor should it be confused with Sagina subulata or Chondrus crispus (an alga), which are also known as \\"Irish moss\\". Description It is a delicate-looking creeping herb with juicy bright green or yellow leaves and multitudes of tiny white flowers. It grows close to the ground in mats and is sometimes used in ornamental gardens alongside ferns and other moisture-loving types of plant. The leaves are usually slightly stalked, about 5 mm across. The minute flowers produce oval seeds.Parnell, J. and Curtis, T. 2012. Webb's An Irish Flora. Cork University Press. Distribution This species is native to the northern Mediterranean region in and around Italy and nearby islands, but it has been introduced and cultivated nearly worldwide as an ornamental and garden plant. It has been recorded from the north east of Ireland in counties Antrim and Down.Hackney, P. (ed) 1992. Stewart and Corry's Flora of the North-east of Ireland third edition. Institute of Irish Studies and The Queen's University of Belfast. Habitat It can be grown indoors as a houseplant and used in habitats for amphibians. It prefers shade and moderate moisture. It can even grow submerged in swampy environments. In colder regions, the plant dies back during winter, but it returns with lush growth as the temperature increases. It is capable of vegetative reproduction, so to eradicate it once it has become established in an area, the entire plant must be removed, or else it can sprout new growth. It is a common weed in many places. Nurseries grow several varieties, including gold, yellow, and white breeds, but the mossy-green type is most popular with gardeners. This species, the only member of the monotypic genus, Soleirolia, was named after Henri-Augustin Soleirol by Esprit Requien. Soleirol, an amateur botanist, originally collected the plant in Corsica.

In his junior season, he rushed for a team best 843 yards and helped the team become Peach Bowl champions. He also was talented as a kicker. As a senior, he converted to tight end, catching 27 passes for 565 yards and eight touchdowns and that was good enough for first team All-American honors. Professional career Drafted in the third round by the Buffalo Bills in the 1971 NFL Draft, he was needed not as the leading rusher, but the blocking weapon for star running back O. J. Simpson. As Simpson remarks, most of his 11,236 career rushing yards were due to Braxton. Braxton's career took off in 1972, his sophomore season in the league, when he rushed for 453 yards on 116 attempts with 5 touchdowns and caught 24 receptions for 232 yards and a score. In 1973 Braxton rushed for 494 yards on 108 attempts with 4 touchdowns despite only playing in 6 games (starting 4) due to being deactivated for the first 8 games with a back injury.

In his 1975 season he rushed for 823 yards and nine touchdowns, which he considered his best season. He also caught 26 passes for 282 yards and 4 touchdowns. His nine rushing touchdowns was 8th in the league, and his 13 all-purpose scores was 5th. In the 1976 season he ended it with a knee injury and rushed for 372 yards and a touchdown during the 1977 season.

Clay Sr. Bridge, formerly known as the Bernard F. Dickmann Bridge and popularly as the Poplar Street Bridge or PSB, completed in 1967, is a deck girder bridge across the Mississippi River between St. Louis, Missouri, and East St. Louis, Illinois. The bridge arrives on the Missouri shore line just south of the Gateway Arch. Background Planned just before construction of the Arch, the builders in 1959 were to request that of the Gateway Arch property be turned over from the National Park Service for the bridge. The request generated enormous controversy and ultimately of the Jefferson Expansion National Memorial (which included all of the original platted area of St. Louis when it was acquired in the 1930s and 1940s) was given to the bridge. Usage Two Interstates and a U.S. Highway cross the entire bridge. Approximately 100,000 vehicles cross the bridge daily, making it the second most heavily used bridge on the river, after the I-94 Dartmouth Bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Some of that load has been diverted to the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge since its opening in 2014. Routes and highways I-55, I-64 and U.S. Route 40 (US 40) cross the Mississippi on the Poplar Street Bridge. US 66 also ran concurrently over this bridge until 1979, and US 50 was routed over it before the Interstates were constructed. In addition, I-70 crossed the river here until 2014, when it was realigned to cross the river on the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge when it was completed. I-44 now follows the old alignment of I-70 through downtown to the west approach for the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge although motorists traveling east on I-44 must continue west on I-70 and do not have a direct connection to the bridge (any access to eastbound I-70 requires using the Poplar Street Bridge). The traffic was heavily congested until the opening of the new bridge in early February 2014. In 2012, 123,564 vehicles used it every day, but after the new bridge opened, congestion alleviated by almost 14%, less than the predicted 20% decline with 106,500 vehicles using it every day because total traffic across the river from all bridges increased by 7.4% over 2013 levels. Historical areas The east end of the bridge crosses the south end of what was Bloody Island which Robert E. Lee connected to the mainland of Illinois with landfill in the 1850s. During its island days several Missouri politicians fought duels there. What was Bloody Island is now a train yard. Name Although the bridge's former name honors former St. Louis mayor Bernard F. Dickmann, it is most commonly referred to as the Poplar Street Bridge, with many locals unaware of its official name. The Missouri end of the bridge sits over Poplar Street, and the media started referring to it by that name long before the bridge opened due to the fact that the bridge was built over Poplar Street. It was officially renamed as the Congressman William L. Clay Sr. Bridge in October 2013 in honor of Bill Clay.http://www.stltoday.com/news/state-and-regional/missouri/st-louis-bridge- renamed-for-long-time- congressman/article_4aa107e9-e014-55e3-a6b5-67af8c53c9ba.html  See also   * * List of crossings of the Upper Mississippi River * McKinley Bridge * Eads Bridge * Martin Luther King Bridge  References   External links  * Category:Bridges completed in 1967 Category:Road bridges in Illinois Category:Bridges over the Mississippi River Category:East St. Louis, Illinois Category:Interstate 64 Category:Interstate 55 Category:U.S. Route 40 Category:Bridges in St. Louis Category:Bridges on the Interstate Highway System Category:Bridges on U.S. Route 66 Category:Steel bridges in the United States Category:Bridges in St. Clair County, Illinois Category:Road bridges in Missouri Category:Bridges on the United States Numbered Highways Category:U.S. Route 50 Category:Interstate 70 Category:Girder bridges in the United States Category:1967 establishments in Missouri Category:1967 establishments in Illinois Category:Interstate vehicle bridges in the United States ","title":"Poplar Street Bridge"},{"id":"2517311","text":"Claire Shulman (n√©e Kantoff; February 23, 1926August 16, 2020) was an American politician and registered nurse from New York City. She served as director of community boards and deputy president of Queens Borough, before becoming interim borough president in 1986 when her predecessor resigned due to scandal. Shulman proceeded to serve in the role full-time and won four elections between 1986 and 2002. She was the first woman to hold the position. Early life Shulman was born in Brooklyn on February 23, 1926. She graduated from Adelphi University and was a registered nurse before getting into politics. She met her future husband, Mel Shulman, a doctor, while both were working at Queens Hospital Center. Career Shulman first became involved in community life when she joined the Bayside Mother's Club in 1955. She was active in Queens community affairs and was appointed to a community board in 1966, eventually going on to become its chairwomen. She subsequently became Queens borough president Donald Manes' director of community boards in 1972 and his deputy in 1980. She took office initially as acting Borough President on February 11, 1986, after the scandal-tarred Manes, who later committed suicide, resigned. She was elected Borough President by a unanimous vote of the nine New York City Council members from Queens on March 12. She was then elected by popular vote to the remaining three years of Manes' term later that year and to four-year terms again in 1989, 1993, and 1997. She was unable to run for re-election in 2001 because of term limits, and was succeeded by Helen Marshall on January 3, 2002. Shulman was noted for her passionate advocacy on issues including economic development, airport disputes, and the environment. For instance, she secured funding for the construction of Queens Hospital Center, as well as for 30,000 more school places for students. She also mediated a compromise with the board in 1987, when it voted in favor of a key city rezoning proposal that would spur the construction of middle-income apartment blocks. Neighborhoods made up of mostly single-family detached homes were against the proposal, and Shulman obtained an exemption for twelve such areas in Queens. Affiliations Shulman served as a member of the boards of directors of New York Hospital Queens and St. Mary's Healthcare System for Children. She also assisted the Queens Zoo in obtaining its first bald eagle. The zoo's current bald eagles, Mel and Claire II, are named after Shulman and her husband.New York Zoos and Aquarium website Personal life During the last years of her life, she and her husband, Melvin Shulman, lived in Beechhurst, Queens, New York. They had one daughter, Ellen S. Baker, an astronaut \\"A Vision for Education\\": Speech by New York City Mayor Rudolph W.

Their adopted son, Kim Shulman, who worked as an assistant director on television series including Party of Five and films including Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves, died from a cerebral hemorrhage on June 2, 2001. Later life Shulman established Flushing Willets Point Corona Local Development Corporation, and served as its president and CEO when it aggressively lobbied the New York City Council in 2007 and 2008 to approve controversial legislation that would remove all of the existing private property owners and 250 industrial businesses from the neighborhood of Willets Point, Queens, for redevelopment. She was found to have conducted the lobbying for more than one year without filing any of the required public disclosures. An investigation by the City Clerk's Lobbying Bureau led to it imposing a fine of $59,090 against Shulman's LDC, which was a then-record penalty on a New York City lobbyist. However, Mayor Michael Bloomberg came to her defense, characterizing this as a \\"cheap shot\\" against her and adding that \\"these groups are designed to lobby. I don‚Äôt know if they technically broke the law\\". On a state level, then-Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and his successor, Eric Schneiderman investigated Shulman's lobbying campaign over a three-year period. Schneiderman eventually found that Shulman's LDC indeed ‚Äúflouted the law by lobbying elected officials, both directly and through third parties, to win approval of ‚Ä¶ favored projects‚Äù. =Health and death= Shulman survived breast cancer and lost both her breasts in separate mastectomies.

Biography Julia Brace was born to a poor family in Hartford County, Connecticut on June 13, 1807, and became deafblind at age five from typhus fever. She gradually stopped speaking and developed a system of home sign that she used with her parents. She was sent to a boarding school with hearing and sighted children before being offered a place at the Hartford Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb (now called the American School for the Deaf), where she enrolled on June 11, 1825, two days before her 18th birthday. During her childhood, she was described as independent, inquisitive and feisty. Although she wasn't given much formal instruction, she did acquire tactile signing from the resident deaf students and staff at the Hartford school. Despite being the only blind person there, she became a part of the school community, forming friendships (and enemies), fulfilling communal duties, and developing skills in sewing and knitting. She began to be seen as something of a celebrity and received many curious visitors ‚Äî although these regular interruptions to her daily activities apparently annoyed her and she wasn't afraid, on occasion, to make her displeasure known. Her memory of tangible facts was very tenacious, but it had no grasp of abstractions, and it was never apparent that she comprehended the idea of a deity. She was protective of her own rights, and never intentionally invaded those of others, and she was never known to deceive. She was kind and gentle enough to be entrusted with the care of the sick, and made an excellent nurse. Samuel Gridley Howe, educator from the Perkins School for the Blind, began instructing the 7-year-old deafblind Laura Bridgman after meeting Brace during a visit to the Hartford school around 1837. After four years and much success with his young pupil, Howe returned to Hartford in 1841, bringing Bridgman with him. Although Brace was 34 years old, Howe thought he would also like to attempt to instruct her in the English language as he had Bridgman. On April 6, 1842, Brace enrolled as a student of the Perkins School. Announcement in the newspaper stated woman named Mrs. Martha Johonnet left Julia Brace 200 dollars annually after Martha's death. Howe's \\"experiment\\", however, proved less successful than he had hoped, as Brace clearly preferred to communicate in sign language, and she returned to the Hartford school after a year, where she continued to board until 1860. She left the school to take up residence with her sister in Bloomfield, Connecticut, where she died on August 12, 1884, aged 77. She was buried in an unmarked grave in the West Hill Cemetery.

The tactics were developed shortly after the 11 September 2001 attacks, based in part on consultation with Israeli and Sri Lankan law enforcement agencies on how to deal with suicide bombers. Little was revealed about these tactics until after the mistaken shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes on 22 July 2005, in the wake of the 7 July 2005 London bombings. The term is no longer used by the Metropolitan Police, although similar tactics remain in force.  Development  After the 11 September 2001 attacks, many police agencies worldwide began to seriously consider the possibility of suicide attacks in their own home countries and cities. A Metropolitan Police team led by Barbara Wilding, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Specialist Operations, visited Israel, Sri Lanka and Russia, to learn from their experience of suicide attacks. They also consulted with UK government scientists. Key findings were: * The explosives used by suicide bombers were very sensitive, and were likely to be detonated by the conventional tactic of firing at the chest, as well as by less-lethal weapons. * Suicide bombers were likely to detonate their devices on realising that they had been identified. Police must act covertly, and tactics must ensure immediate incapacitation to give the bomber no opportunity to detonate the bomb. New tactics were developed in the first half of 2002 by Wilding and Sir David Veness, Assistant Commissioner Specialist Operations. These were designated Operation Kratos, named after the Greek demi-god Kratos (). Work on the policy was taken over by the Terrorism and Allied Matters Committee of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) in January 2003. A paper entitled Operation Kratos People was circulated among UK police forces, and Operation Kratos became national policy.  Details  Operation Kratos is the collective name for a range of anti-terrorist tactics, specifically: * Operation Andromeda, \\"designed to deal with the spontaneous sighting by a member of the public of a suspected suicide bomber.\\" * Operation Beach, \\"where there is an intelligence-led covert operation to locate and arrest persons suspected of involvement in acts of terrorism.\\" * Operation Clydesdale, \\"where intelligence has been received about a suicide attack on a pre-planned event.\\" These plans deal with identifying and confronting suicide attackers. Ideally, the confrontation would be arranged in a secluded location to avoid risk to police officers and members of the public. In extreme situations, the policy recommends that covert police officers fire on suspected suicide attackers without warning, aiming multiple shots at the brain stem to minimise the risk of detonation of a bomb. The Metropolitan Police and other forces also issue Kratos officers with hollow point ammunition, but this has not been incorporated into national guidance. The decision whether to take such drastic action would be made by a Designated Senior Officer (DSO), an officer of Commander or Deputy Assistant Commissioner rank designated for that incident. The Met had previously used an on-site Designated Senior Officer in policing the Notting Hill Carnival, to decide whether to employ baton rounds should a riot develop, but the situation never arose. To deal with the more severe challenge of suicide bombers, Kratos DSOs would be centrally located, and would be available at all times.  London bombings and the de Menezes shooting  After the London Tube and Bus bombings of 7 July 2005, an internal email was sent to specialised police units reminding them of the secret tactics for dealing with suicide bombers. Operation Kratos was first described publicly in an article in The Scotsman on 15 July 2005. Between 21 July and 5 August, Designated Senior Officers were alerted on 11 occasions, with Armed Response Units deployed to 6 of these incidents. On one of these occasions, they opened fire. In the evening after the attempted 21 July 2005 London bombings, Specialist Firearms Officers supporting the search for the bombers were issued with hollow point ammunition. When police linked Hussain Osman and another suspect to a block of flats in Brixton, the block was placed under surveillance. Commander Cressida Dick, who would also act as Gold Commander of the operation, was appointed as Kratos DSO. The firearms team were informed that they faced suicide bombers, that a DSO was in place, and that they might be required to use \\"unusual tactics\\". On the morning of 22 July, surveillance officers believed that a man leaving the flats might have been Osman. In fact, the man was Jean Charles de Menezes, who had no connection to the bombers other than his home address. As the firearms team was not at the site (for unknown reasons), one of the watchers followed him onto a bus. de Menezes's innocent actions were misinterpreted as counter-surveillance measures, and a firearms team was called to intercept him. By the time they had arrived, de Menezes had entered Stockwell tube station and boarded a Tube train. Although no Kratos codeword had been given, the firearms officers believed him to be a suicide bomber. A surveillance officer seized de Menezes in a bear hug, and two plainclothes armed officers fired a total of nine shots, six of which struck his head from distances of 1 to 8 cm (¬Ω\\" to 3\\"). Menezes died at the scene.  Reaction to the shooting  The manner of the killing was such a departure from previous police practice that observers speculated that it had been carried out by military special forces. Most commentators agreed that the authorities must have been certain of an imminent threat to order such drastic action. After the police admitted that they had shot an innocent man, the Operation Kratos policies came to national and international attention, with some commentators decrying the policies as unnecessarily violent and ineffective, and others supporting the difficult decisions made by the police in fighting terrorism. An Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) report identified a series of errors on the part of police, and recommended a number of changes. No individual officers were charged, but the Metropolitan Police were later found guilty of breaching the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and fined. The inquest into the death of de Menezes made further criticisms of the police, and returned an open verdict. ACPO reviewed Operation Kratos in March 2006 and declared it still \\"fit for purpose\\". The Met made changes to the command structure of Operation Kratos after the shooting. In the future, authorisation of a critical shot would be communicated by a clear English phrase rather than code-words. Authorisation would still come from specially trained officers of Commander rank or higher, but these would now be called Extreme Threat Tactical Commanders rather than DSOs. Despite the high rank of this officer, they would not command the whole operation, but would monitor the operation and take over tactical command when a threat of suicide bombing became apparent. The number of such officers in the Met would be reduced to 12, and they would receive more intensive training. The term Operation Kratos was dropped at the beginning of 2008. Wooden Pride After the 2008 Mumbai attacks by a group of highly trained men armed with automatic weapons, the MPS strategic planning team reviewed their planned response to a similar attack on an urban area in the UK. They concluded that the police armed units were inadequate to cope with such a situation and would have to rely on military special forces. Police firearms were upgraded and in a series of exercises over the following years called \\"Wooden Pride\\", police counter-terrorism and firearms units practiced a coordinated response with the Special Air Service and Special Boat Service.

It is also the home of the First Nation of Na-Cho Ny√§k Dun, whose primary language is Northern Tutchone. Na-Cho Ny√§k Dun translates into \\"big river people.\\" The community, formerly called Mayo Landing, is serviced by Mayo Airport. The village was named after former circus acrobat turned settler and explorer Alfred Mayo. Its only school is J. V. Clark School, which is named after Dr. Clark. The school had about 70 students in 2012. The current Principal is Rosemary Popadynec. History Before Europeans came there were in the area two communities of the Na-cho Ny√§k Dun people, who lived by hunting and trapping. The river now known as the Stewart River was known as the \\"N√°hcho Ny√§k\\" (\\"Great River\\"). The people lived across the Stewart River from the main focus of today's Mayo, in a district today called \\"Old Mayo village\\". The old settlement was reinstated on the initiative of a missionary, but in 1934 the river burst its banks and flattened much of the old village, destroying the church and many cultural treasures. The first gold discoveries in the area were made in the 1880s: silver was also discovered some time later. Till the mid-twentieth century Mayo was connected with the outside world by the river and received any supplies by boat. In the 1950s the construction of the Klondike Highway and the Silver Trail provided Mayo with a road link to Stewart Crossing. Between 1973 and 1984 negotiation took place between the government and the northern Tutchone leaders over land rights and self-government. A breakthrough came only in 1993 with a treatyA summary of the treaty appears at First Nation of Na-cho Ny√§k Dun Self-Government Agreement between the residents and the lawmakers concerning an area of and a payment, over fifteen years, totalling C$14.5 million.

Designated by color rather than issue numbers (namely Yellow, Blue, Black, and Red) plus two book-end issues, Deathmate Prologue and Deathmate Epilogue, as well as Preview issues collected with comic products, the four main issues were written so they could be read in any order. Created at the peak of the comic book speculator boom, the project was heavily promoted and sold hundreds of thousands of copies, but was beset with production delays. The Image half (Black, Red, and Epilogue) came out severely behind schedule and out of sequence. Deathmate Red shipped after the epilogue issue, and despite cover dates of September 1993 to February 1994, the actual publication lag was far longer than six months. The plot evolved around a chance interdimensional meeting of two characters, Solar from Valiant and Void from Image's WildC.A.T.s. The two became lovers, but their joining would mean the destruction of both comic book universes. It is notable that only half of the Image founding members chose to take part. Erik Larsen, Jim Valentino, and Todd McFarlane were not involved, although McFarlane's character Al Simmons makes a brief appearance in Deathmate Red.

In December 2017, a Reddit user and member of the Valiant Fans forum claimed that he had solved the dilemma and suggested that there is, in fact, a reading order where the story is more coherent. The proposed order is: # Prologue # Green (Advance) # Red # Pink/Orange (Previews) # Yellow # Blue # Black # Epilogue This proposed order is wildly different from the order in which the issues were published. It's based on the content within the books and the timeline in which events must occur in order for a non-contradictory, cohesive narrative to exist. Deathmate was long considered \\"uncollectable\\" due to it having no proper order, and largely being viewed as unreadable by fans, but this new proposed order potentially solves that problem. Regardless, a collection seems unlikely as the character rights are now spread across several companies, with Solar, Magnus and Turok having reverted to DreamWorks Classics and NBCUniversal and the Wildstorm characters now being owned by DC Comics.  Aftermath  Although the issues of Deathmate produced by Valiant shipped on schedule, those produced by Image Comics did not, a problem that Image faced with many of its publications in its early years. The books were pre-ordered in heavy quantities by retailers, and when shipping dates were not met, distributors cancelled the original orders and required re-orders. By the time the last issues did arrive, some fans had lost interest, leaving retailers with unsold copies. As a cross-promotion, two trading card companies also did a cross-over, Upper Deck and Topps. But, because of the deadline problems with Image Comics, Topps ended up backing out of the contract. In a retrospective interview on the rise and fall of Valiant, Bob Layton (former editor in chief) lambasted the whole affair, regarding it as an \\"unmitigated disaster.\\"McLelland, Ryan. \\"Valiant Days, Valiant Nights - A Look Back at the Rise and Fall of Valiant\\" . Newsarama. September 24, 2003. Archived at ValiantFans.com. Retrieved August 21, 2013. Layton says he had to fly to Los Angeles and literally sit on Liefeld's doorstep until Liefeld finished his penciled art for the Deathmate Prologue, and then Layton inked the artwork himself in an Anaheim hotel room. Layton stated, \\"What a pain in the ass that was! There I was, with my own company to manage, and I was in California, managing someone else's people. I look back at it and can't believe some of the shit I had to put up with as E.I.C. of Valiant. As far as failures, Deathmate and [Valiant promotion] Birthquake were unmitigated disasters. Not necessarily in the numbers, but in the consequences of their release...I think that Deathmate sounded the beginning of the problems, and when Image couldn't get their side of the cross-over out on time, it hurt everyone. I think [Valiant crossover] Chaos Effect the next summer was a decent idea, but there wasn't anything new to capture the audience's imagination. We made a specific mistake in choosing not to advertise during the summer of '93. Our books were almost too hot and we wanted to get more realistic numbers. Remember, we were the collectible company. That meant wealthier speculators buying cases of the stuff, hoping to sell it for ten times what they paid for it within a year. In some cases, they did! That's why there's so much of our output from that era on the market.\\" \\"I literally had nothing to do with most of those projects,\\" Layton revealed, \\"Deathmate was thrust upon us because (Steve) Massarsky and Jim Lee were best buddies at the time and had privately arranged the crossover.\\" For retailers, Deathmate was harmful, due to the tying up of cash flow with books arriving late, especially given the $4.95 USD cover price (at the time, the average comic book cover price was less than half of that). Also due to waning fan interest, the re-orders were lower than initial orders. The Valiant Deathmate books (Prologue, Blue, and Yellow) had print runs of over 700,000 copies, but by the time Deathmate Red was released, it had a print run of 250,000, although retailers were nonetheless left with many unsold copies. At the time, comic book distributors would only allow unsold books to be returned if they were six months late. Retailers dealt constantly with late books from Image, which indirectly caused some comic book shops to close. Partially due to the lateness of Image publications, the window was eventually decreased to two months.  References   External links  *Marcotte, John (May 14, 2005). \\"The Comic-Book Apocalypse\\".

At the University of Z√ºrich, Huber studied jurisprudence, where he received a doctorate in 1872 with a thesis on \\"The Swiss law of inheritance in its development since the separation of the Old Swiss Confederacy from the Holy Roman Empire.\\" In 1875, he was a correspondent for a newspaper in Z√ºrich until he replaced a judge in Appenzell from 1877 until 1880. In 1880, he became a professor of Swiss civil and federal law at the University of Basel and later, in 1888, he became a professor at Halle University in Halle and Wittenberg, where he taught legal history, private and commercial law, public land law as well as canon law and philosophy of law. During this time, he began to write an extensive treatise on the private laws of the cantons, which was published in four volumes. In 1892, he was asked by the Swiss government to draft the Swiss civil code (Zivilgesetzbuch), which he completed in 1904. It was enacted in 1907 and entered into force in 1912. The Zivilgesetzbuch was applauded for being clear and modern, and it was later adopted in Turkey. Huber was also a member of the Law Sources Commission of the Swiss Lawyers Society, which prepared the edition of the Collection of Swiss Law Sources.Lukas Gschwend: Die Sammlung Schweizerischer Rechtsquellen, herausgegeben von der Rechtsquellenstiftung des Schweizerischen Juristenvereins: Ein Monumentalwerk rechtshistorischer Grundlagenforschung.

Clarke was one of three commissioners appointed to run the District of Columbia from 1960 to 1963, and later rose to the rank of Chief of Engineers in the Corps of Engineers. Clarke was born in Little Falls, New York. In 1937 he graduated fourth in his class at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He was then commissioned in the Corps of Engineers, while continuing his graduate work. Clarke received a master's degree in civil engineering from Cornell University in 1940 and later attended the six-week Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School. He also completed graduate studies at the Army War College. During World War II he commanded a battalion of the 38th Combat Engineers that helped construct a military airfield on Ascension Island in the South Atlantic, a key refueling point for transatlantic flights to Africa. He also served in Washington, D.C., in the headquarters of the Army Service Forces. He served as a logistics planner on General George C. Marshall's staff. He also was an early developer of the \\"Red Ball Express\\" operation that kept European beachheads supplied. As the war in Europe ended, he was involved in the frenzied planning effort to redirect supplies to the Pacific. Clarke also worked in the atomic energy field for the Manhattan Engineer District (best known as the Manhattan Project). After the war his atomic work continued, with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission at Hanford, Washington, and at the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project at Sandia Laboratory, Albuquerque, New Mexico. As the District Engineer of the Trans- East District of the Corps in 1957-59, he was responsible for U.S. military construction in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and he initiated transportation surveys in East Pakistan and Burma. From 1874 to 1967, before \\"District of Columbia home rule,\\" the District was governed by three federally appointed commissioners (one a civil engineer, selected from the Army Corps of Engineers). In 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Clarke as the District's Engineer Commissioner. He was the technician-in-chief, called to address the problems such as traffic gridlock, economic development and low levels of funding. At one point early in his term, he was the only commissioner available for full-time duty, because one post was vacant and the other commissioner had suffered a heart attack. In the early 1960s, Clarke participated in talks that led to the compact agreement for construction of the Washington Metro railway and subway system. As chairman of the District's zoning commission, he participated in early debates over the controversial proposal to build an interstate bridge near the Three Sisters Islands in the Potomac River, and over a planned freeway through the heart of the District. After his term as Engineer Commissioner ended in 1963, he served as Director of Military Construction in the Office of the Chief of Engineers (1963‚Äì65); Commanding General of the Army Engineer Center and Fort Belvoir and Commandant of the Army Engineer School (1965‚Äì66); and Deputy Chief of Engineers (1966‚Äì69). He achieved the rank of Lieutenant General. As Chief of Engineers Clarke guided the Corps as it devoted increased attention to the environmental impact of its work. He retired from the Army in 1973 after a 37-year career, then served as executive director of the National Commission on Water Quality. In the 1980s, he was a consultant to the Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy, Stratton engineering firm. After his death in 2002, he was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.ArlingtonCemetery.net - Frederick J. Clarke Clarke was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal and the Legion of Merit.

Grand Concourse runs through several neighborhoods, including Bedford Park, Concourse, Highbridge, Fordham, Mott Haven, Norwood and Tremont. For most of its length, the Concourse is wide, though portions of the Concourse are narrower. The Grand Concourse was designed by Louis Aloys Risse, an immigrant from Saint- Avold, Lorraine, France. Risse first conceived of the road in 1890, and the Concourse was built between 1894 and 1909, with an additional extension in 1927. The development of the Concourse led to the construction of apartment buildings surrounding the boulevard, and by 1939 it was called \\"the Park Avenue of middle-class Bronx residents\\". A period of decline followed in the 1960s and 1970s, when these residences became dilapidated and the Concourse was redesigned to be more motorist-friendly. Renovation and redevelopment started in the 1980s, and a portion of the Grand Concourse was reconstructed starting in the 2000s. The southern portion of the Grand Concourse is surrounded by several historically important residential buildings, which were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 as part of the Grand Concourse Historic District. In 2011, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated numerous buildings around the Grand Concourse as part of a city landmark district. Additionally, several individual points of interest are located on or near the Concourse, including the Bronx Museum of the Arts and Edgar Allan Poe Cottage.  Description  The Grand Concourse's southern terminus is at 138th Street. Shortly afterward, it merges with the entrance ramp to southbound Major Deegan Expressway (I-87), as well as the exit ramp from northbound I-87. The Grand Concourse continues as a divided eight-lane avenue, with two to three traffic lanes in each direction, until 161st Street. North of there, the service roads in each direction begin, and a unidirectional buffered bike lane runs on the left edge of either service road. The Grand Concourse is briefly a ten-lane boulevard with four roadways, two in each direction, until just south of 165th Street. There, the northbound and southbound inner roadways merge into a five-lane undivided roadway with two lanes in each direction and a left-turn lane and painted median in the center. The buffered bike lanes on each service road end at 171st Street, and conventional bike lanes start on the right lane of the respective service roads. This configuration with three roadways (two service roads and one main road) continues north until Mosholu Parkway, where the Grand Concourse ends. At Fordham Road, the main road passes underneath in a grade-separated junction, while the service roads intersect with Fordham Road. Between approximately 161st and 204th Streets, the New York City Subway's IND Concourse Line () runs under the Grand Concourse. The IRT Jerome Avenue Line () also runs underneath the boulevard for a short section south of 149th Street. The Bx1 local bus and the BxM4 express bus run the entire length of the Grand Concourse, while the Bx2 local bus runs on the Concourse north of 149th Street.  History  = Construction = Intersection plan, 1892 Risse first conceived of the road in 1890, as a means of connecting the borough of Manhattan to the northern Bronx.The New York Times, March 18, 2009 Looking back at the Grand Concourse First Century Construction began on the Grand Concourse in 1894 and it was opened to traffic in November 1909. Built during the height of the City Beautiful movement, it was modeled on the Champs- √âlys√©es in Paris but is considerably larger, stretching four miles (6 km) in length, measuring across, and separated into three roadways by tree-lined dividers, so some minor streets did not cross the Concourse. The cost of the project was $14 million (worth $ today). The Grand Concourse originally stretched from Bronx Borough Hall at 161st Street north to Van Cortlandt Park. It was expanded southward to 138th Street in 1927 after Mott Avenue was widened to accommodate the boulevard. Evidence of the Grand Concourse extension's old name is present at the 149th Street‚ÄìGrand Concourse station, where there are signs reading \\"Mott Avenue\\". = Development = The Interborough Rapid Transit Company's Jerome Avenue Line opened a few blocks west of the Grand Concourse in 1917, initiating a housing boom amongst upwardly mobile, predominantly Jewish and Italian, families who were fleeing the crowded tenements of Manhattan. In 1923, Yankee Stadium opened near the Grand Concourse at 161st Street, down the hill from the Concourse Plaza Hotel. South of Fordham Road, the palatial Loew's Paradise theater, one of the Loew's Wonder Theatres and at one time the largest movie theater in New York City, was constructed in 1929. Development of the Concourse was further encouraged by the opening of the Independent Subway System's Concourse Line in 1933. By the mid-1930s, almost three hundred apartment buildings had been built along the Concourse. Customarily five or six stories high with wide entrance courtyards bordered with grass and shrubs, among these apartments are many of the finest examples of Art Deco and Art Moderne architecture in the United States. Even though the Great Depression, which was happening at the time, ended the period of tremendous growth, privately financed apartment buildings continued to be constructed. Furthermore, work was done on the Grand Concourse as part of WPA programs. During this period, the Bronx had more amenities than other boroughs: in 1934, almost 99% of residences had private bathrooms, and 95% had central heating. In the 1939 WPA Guide to New York City, the Grand Concourse was described as \\"the Park Avenue of middle-class Bronx residents, and the lease to an apartment in one of its many large buildings is considered evidence of at least moderate business success.\\" = Decline = In 1941, the New York City Planning Department proposed converting the boulevard into an expressway, in order to connect the Major Deegan Expressway and the proposed Park Avenue Expressway to the south with the Mosholu Parkway to the north. However, these plans were abandoned following the southern extension of the Bronx River Parkway in the 1940s and the extension of the Major Deegan Expressway to the north in the 1950s. The south and central Bronx rapidly deteriorated in the 1960s, as there was general disinvestment in the region's real estate, exacerbated by urban renewal and redlining programs. Many white residents of the South Bronx left for suburban areas in a process known as white flight; they were helped by the construction of the Interstate Highway System. At the same time, African Americans and Puerto Ricans were moving to the Bronx for blue-collar jobs; however, these jobs were increasingly being shifted to the suburbs, the Southern United States, and other countries. Racial discrimination against these demographic groups prevented them from moving to the suburbs, forcing them into deteriorating urban housing stock. The buildings around the Concourse thus came to be perceived as old and low- rent, and subsequent cycles of disinvestment led landlords on the Concourse to pay decreasingly less attention to their housing stock, while banks and insurance companies failed to give financial support to these neighborhoods. Further outward migration between 1968 and 1970 drained the areas along the Grand Concourse of most of its remaining middle-class residents. Many buildings in the area were damaged by arson, vandalism, and a lack of maintenance. The road itself was modified to be more hospitable to motorists. During the 1960s, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation removed the grass median on the Concourse and replaced it with cement that was painted green. By the 1980s, The New York Times characterized the Concourse as \\"a driver‚Äôs paradise\\". Traffic lights were timed so that motorists received a \\"green wave\\", moving through intersections at a time. Meanwhile, pedestrian crossings and trees were eliminated, and green highway signs were placed on the Concourse. = Restoration = During the 1980s, landlords along the Concourse and elsewhere in the South Bronx began rehabilitating their buildings. The Bronx Museum of the Arts, was one of the institutions to move to the area, relocating in 1982 to a former synagogue at Grand Concourse and 167th Street. The city created the \\"Special Grand Concourse Preservation District\\" in 1989 to preserve the character of residential buildings on the Concourse. This led to new building developments on the Concourse starting in the 1990s, including the Rafael Vi√±oly-designed Bronx Housing Courthouse at 1118 Grand Concourse. In addition, basement stores started opening on the Concourse in the 1980s, serving the predominantly minority communities around the boulevard. By 2003, a New York Times writer observed that \\"every block between 161st Street and 196th Street now has a grocery, a barber shop, a travel agency or a medical clinic\\".  Boulevard reconstruction  By the early 1990s, politicians and community advocates strove to make the Concourse more usable for pedestrians. At that time, the Concourse was one of the most dangerous streets in New York City, with twelve pedestrians dying in 1991, rivaling the reputation of Queens Boulevard as the \\"Boulevard of Death\\". In 1992, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) conducted a study of the Grand Concourse, which resulted in improvements such as left-turn signals; pedestrian barriers; roadway markings; repainted crosswalks; and new and improved signage. These improvements continued along the entire corridor through 2006. As an experiment, the NYCDOT also completely rebuilt the section between 161st Street and 167th Streets starting in 1999, as a \\"demonstration\\" project. The Grand Concourse underwent an $18 million restoration and landscaping to widen and landscape the medians; improve lighting; add new signage; build pedestrian planters in the medians; and add bike lanes. This resulted in a 69% drop in accidents along this section between 1998 and 2005. The final part of the demonstration project was completed in 2008. Following the success of the \\"demonstration\\" reconstruction, the NYCDOT unveiled a four- phase capital project between 161st Street and Fordham Road as part of a capital project, which would receive funding directly from the city. The demonstration project was the first phase of the capital project. A reconstruction of the Grand Concourse between 166th and 171st Street began in 2013 and was finished in June 2017. Funding is being allocated for a reconstruction of the Grand Concourse from 171st Street to 175th Street, which is already in planning. In January 2017, the New York City Department of Transportation started planning for a fourth phase, which will renovate the section between 175th Street and Fordham Road.  Gentrification  Because of its attractive art deco buildings and close proximity to Manhattan, the southern portion has been experiencing gentrification and is drawing many young professionals to the area. Since the 2000s, the area around the Grand Concourse has been the center of what real state agents are calling a ‚Äúrenewal\\", with new residents moving in, and severe crime rates having decreased significantly. The New York Times cited several residents who believed that, while the region would experience demographic changes, it would be working-class, ‚Äúcommunity-oriented‚Äù people, as opposed to the richer individuals that have gentrified other neighborhoods of the city.  Significant buildings  Louis J Heintz, promoter of Grand Concourse, in Kilmer Park Several buildings of importance to New York City and the Bronx, both because of their history and their current use, are located along the Grand Concourse. There are also numerous structures designated as New York City Landmarks (NYCL) and National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on the Concourse.Interactive map: Note: This includes and Accompanying 14 photographs From south to north (in increasing address order), they include: * 475 Grand Concourse ‚Äì Hostos Community College * 558 Grand Concourse ‚Äì The Bronx General Post Office (NRHP, NYCL; built 1935-1937; architect Thomas Harlan Ellett).

It lies at the junction of the Ross River and the Pelly River, along the Canol Road, not far from the Campbell Highway. Primary access to the Campbell Highway is via a nine-mile access road. Formerly it was accessed along a six-mile Canol Road section that is no longer maintained. It is serviced by Ross River Airport, used mainly for charter and scheduled flights to and from Whitehorse and Watson Lake. In 2016, the community had a population of 382. It is the home of the Ross River Dena Council, a First Nation in eastern Yukon.http://www.rrdc.ca/ History of the community The confluence of the Ross and Pelly rivers had long been used as a gathering place for First Nation peoples, particularly in the late summer. The first permanent settlement was established in 1901 when Tom Smith started a small fur trading post on the north bank of the Pelly and called the spot Smiths Landing. That winter approximately 15 First Nation families overwintered near the post, creating the beginnings of the permanent community of Ross River. By 1903 a second, rival trading post was set up on the south bank of the Pelly opposite Smiths Landing. The settlement attracted an increasing number of people, mostly the Kaska but including many First Nation people from the Mackenzie River region who would travel over the divide to meet others, trade, and sometimes stay. By 1914 over 1,000 people were gathering at Ross River in the late summer. But a severe influenza epidemic in 1916 hit the community's First Nation people hard, and increasing economic activity and new trading posts along the Mackenzie River reduced the population. World War II and the years immediately following brought massive changes to Ross River. The building of the Canol Road and pipeline between 1942 and 1944 brought a massive, but temporary, influx of newcomers and the new road made the community more accessible, although the road closed in 1946 and did not reopen until 1958. The late 1940s and early 1950s also saw a collapse of fur prices and the permanent closure of most of the region's fur trading posts ‚Äî including Pelly Banks, Sheldon Lake, Rose Point, Frances Lake and Macmillan River. By 1952 Ross River had the only remaining trading post in the region. The Canol Road shifted the commercial centre of the community to the south bank of the Pelly River at the new ferry crossing point and the federal government began pressuring the First Nation to move across the river from the Old Village. By the mid 1960s the community of Ross River assumed the shape it has today. Mining in the area Mining exploration increased in the region around Ross River through the 1950s and an exploration and mining boom occurred in the 1960s and 1970s with the discovery and development of the Faro mine. In 1950 and 1951 Al Kulan, who was inducted into the Canadian Mining Hall of Fame in 2005, prospected the Pelly Range. In 1952 he located mineralization in the Anvil district. In 1953 Ross River Dena citizen Jack Sterriah mentioned a heavy concentration of rust in Vangorda Creek that he had know about as a boy. That year Kulan, Peter Thompson along with Dena citizens Arthur John, China Sterriah, Jack Ladue and Robert Etzel prospected Vangorda Creek and found the first significant mineralization in the area on July 2. They, along with Dena members Joe Etzel and Jack Steriah, were issued shares in the company formed as a result of the discovery, Vangorda Mines Ltd. The property was optioned to Prospectors Airways, headquartered in Toronto. Arthur John, a Dena elder, learned prospecting from, and worked with, Kulan in the early 1950s and his fluency in English enabled him to serve as an intermediary between Kulan and other Ross River Dena members who also learned to identify minerals. John had a long career prospecting with Conwest Exploration as well as Kulan's companies Spartan Exploration and Welcome North Mines. From 1954 to 1957 Kulan prospected north-west of the Vangorda and discovered a rusty area. Geochemical and geophysical surveys resulted in several drill targets. Propspectors Airways would only pay for a packsack drill. The first drill hole was attempted over the No. 2 orebody of what, a decade later, would become Canada's largest lead-zinc mine. This hole could not reach the bedrock due to heavy overburden. The program was discontinued. In 1964 the property was re- staked by Dynasty Explorations which Kulan was a director and officer of. Dynasty staked large tracts of the district and identified many drill targets. Due to lack of funds they joined forces with Cyprus Mines Corporation of Los Angeles. The joint venture was running over budget when a move was made to one of the mineralized sites selected by Kulan, which was one of the last hopes for the discovery of a successful body of ore. In the summer of 1965 the discovery of the mine was made and resulted in the biggest staking rush the Yukon Territory had ever seen. The mine closed permanently in 1997. Arrival of TV and radio at Ross River The Ross River community was too small to get a satellite-serviced transmitter for CBC and did not even have radio ‚Äì residents would drive to Faro to listen to the Canada-Russia hockey series. The first television service arrived after intervention from Al Kulan, who hired a helicopter and pilot from Whitehorse and flew from mountaintop to mountaintop on a bitterly cold night to find the signal from Faro's five watt TV transmitter. After a signal was detected on Grew Creek Hill, Kulan paid for the equipment, and the community's men volunteered their work, bulldozing a road up the mountain. The transmitter caught the government's attention, but the residents steadfastly refused to shut it down and requested a licence. In early 1975, radio was finally installed. Ross River's community effort led to other similar projects that brought TV to every community; Teslin installed their own satellite dish (illegal until 1979), and the Yukon government attempted to negotiate a lower lease price with Telesat Canada which had a monopoly on satellite earth stations until 1979. Climate Ross River has subarctic climate (Dfc) with long, severely cold winters and short but mild summers.

He was the founder of the Freedom Era Weekly. He is most known internationally for setting himself on fire in support of freedom of speech. Background and career Cheng's father was a mainlander from Fuzhou, Fujian, China and his mother was from Keelung, Taiwan. Cheng was born in the year of the February 28 Incident. On his first job-seeking r√©sum√©, Cheng Nan-jung wrote: \\"I was born the year of the February 28 Incident, and this incident has tormented me throughout my life.... Only because we were protected by our neighbors were we mainlanders safe from the wave of retaliation from the Taiwanese.\\" He wrote that his experience growing up in the White Terror drove his commitment to Taiwan independence. Cheng studied engineering at Taiwan Provincial Cheng Kung University, and philosophy at Fu Jen Catholic University and National Taiwan University. He refused to take the classes on Sun Yat-sen Thought (ÂúãÁà∂ÊÄùÊÉ≥), and handed back his National Taiwan University graduation certificate. In March 1984, he founded Freedom Era Weekly and declared that \\"[it was] fighting for 100 percent freedom of speech.\\" Cheng Nan-jung had registered 18 different magazine licences, as \\"spare tires\\" for use when the Kuomintang banned the magazine and suspended publication. He said \\"I'm not scared of arrest nor of being killed, basically, I'll fight them to the very end.\\" The magazine was banned several times by the authorities but continued to be printed and distributed. Immolation and aftermath In 1989, Cheng was charged with insurrection for printing a proposal for a constitution for the Republic of Taiwan. An arrest warrant was issued. He refused to appear in court. When the police attempted to break into his office in order to arrest him on April 7, he committed suicide by self-immolation. He set fire to his office and died in the blaze. His immolation protest against the Kuomintang was covered by Formosa Television several years later. At Cheng's funeral on May 19, another Taiwanese pro-democracy activist, Chan I-hua, also immolated himself when the funeral procession was blocked by police. Cheng's widow, Yeh Chu-lan, held senior positions in the Democratic Progressive Party administration between 2000 and 2005. Former vice-Prime Minister, she was acting mayor of Kaohsiung from July 2005 to December 2006. In 2007 she was mentioned as a possible running mate for Frank Hsieh in the 2008 Taiwan Presidential Election, but in the end Hsieh picked Su Tseng-chang. In 1999, a museum dedicated to Cheng called the Cheng Nan-jung Liberty Museum was opened in Taipei. The museum rests on the venue where Cheng immolated himself. On 22 December 2016, the Executive Yuan announced that 7 April every year would become Freedom of Expression Day to commemorate his death. In November 2013, as a vote was organizing to choose a name for a new square in National Cheng Kung University, his name won the vote, but the university chief secretary (who has represented the Kuomintang) decided to cancel the vote.http://www.cna.com.tw/news/firstnews/201401170021.aspx See also *List of political self-immolations Cheng Nan-jung References External links *twhistory.org.tw - An epic poem not yet finished: Twelve years after Cheng Nan-jung's self-immolation Category:1947 births Category:1989 deaths Category:Fu Jen Catholic University alumni Category:Magazine editors Category:National Cheng Kung University alumni Category:National Taiwan University alumni Category:Writers from Taipei Category:Suicides by self- immolation Category:Suicides in Taiwan Category:Taiwan independence activists Category:Taiwanese revolutionaries Category:Taiwanese journalists Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Cheng Nan-jung"},{"id":"2517429","text":"Ruth Glacier is a glacier in Denali National Park and Preserve in the U.S. state of Alaska.

Ruth Glacier moves at a rate of three feet per day and was measured to be 4,000 feet thick in 1983. Surrounding the Ruth Gorge are many mountains of the Alaska Range, including the Mooses Tooth, Mount Dickey, Mount Bradley, Mount Wake, Mount Johnson, and London Tower with highly technical ice and rock climbs on their faces. History In 1903, the glacier was explored by physician and ethnographer Frederick Cook, who named it after his youngest daughter.

The EOS 5D was announced by Canon on 22 August 2005, and at the time was priced above the EOS 20D but below the EOS-1D Mark II and EOS-1Ds Mark II in Canon's EOS digital SLR series. The camera accepts EF lens mount lenses. The EOS 5D is notable for being the first full-frame DSLR camera with a standard body size (as opposed to the taller, double-grip \\"professional\\" camera body style). It is also notable for its price, suggested at US$3299 without lens, which set a significant new low price point for full-frame DSLRs; its only full-frame competition at the time was the Canon 1Ds Mark II, which cost more than twice as much. On 17 September 2008, Canon announced the camera's successor, the Canon EOS 5D Mark II. Features =Sensor and image processing= The 5D has a DIGIC II processor and a 35.8 x 23.9 mm full-frame CMOS sensor with 13.3 million pixels (12.7 megapixel effective) and a pixel density of 1.5 megapixels per square centimetre. ISO speeds from 100 to 1600 are provided, adjustable in 1/3 steps (ISO can be expanded to L: 50 or H: 3200 with a menu function). The ISO 50 setting reduces dynamic range by a stop in the highlights. =Autofocus and metering= The 5D has nine autofocus points (plus six \\"invisible assist AF points\\" available only during continuous-focus tracking) arranged in a horizontal diamond pattern. The AF system was a minor upgrade to the one on the 20D. The camera uses TTL 35-zone SPC metering with four variations (evaluative, center-weighted, partial, spot) and exposure compensation of ‚àí2 EV to +2 EV in steps of 1/3 EV.E-TTL II flash metering is provided. =Shutter= The shutter is rated to 100,000 shots,Canon's Official Website: Canon EOS 5D Digital SLR and is capable of speeds up to 1/8000 sec, with a flash sync speed of 1/200 sec. =Ergonomics= Back of the Canon EOS 5D camera The 5D is very similar in design to the 20D, and most of the controls are identical or nearly so. Differences include: * A much larger and brighter pentaprism viewfinder with approx. 96% coverage. This arrangement, borrowed from the 1D range, omits the pop-up flash of the consumer range. * A larger, 230,000 pixel, 2.5\\" (63 mm) colour TFT liquid-crystal monitor =Speed= The 5D can shoot up to 3 frames per second, with a buffer that can store up to 60 frames in large JPEG mode, and up to 17 frames in RAW. =Physical dimensions= * Size (LxHxW): 152 x 113 x 75 mm (6.0 x 4.4 x 2.9 in) * Weight (body only w/battery): 895 g =File numbering= The 5D is the first prosumer Canon DSLR where 9,999 images are stored to one folder (which was exclusive to the EOS-1D series), unlike its predecessors where 100 images are stored. =Software= The package includes the following software: * Digital Photo Professional * ZoomBrowser EX / ImageBrowser * PhotoStitch * EOS Utility * Picture Style Editor The EOS 5D is compatible with Magic Lantern firmware (old versions only).

History The land for the park was acquired by the city in 1889 and the park was open by 1891. It was originally named Winthrop Park after an assemblyman, Col. Winthrop Jones, who acquired the land for purchase and who happened to be the son of the Parks Commissioner. Jones died in 1890, shortly after the park's creation. In 1941 the park was renamed for Monsignor Edward J. McGolrick (1857-1938), the longtime pastor of nearby St. Cecilia's Roman Catholic Church. Winthrop Jones had had no children, and so left no family in Greenpoint to oppose the renaming of the park he had helped establish. Features McGolrick Park in early winter The classical brick and limestone Shelter Pavilion was built in 1910 by Helmle and Huberty. It was designated a New York City Landmark in 1966 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It was rehabilitated in 1985. West of the pavilion stands a bronze winged victory figure created by Carl Augustus Heber in 1923. The monument honors the 150 residents of Greenpoint, Brooklyn who fought in World War I. The statue depicts a female allegorical figure, holding aloft a modified laurel, a symbol of victory, and in her right hand supporting a large palm frond, a symbol of peace. The granite pedestal is inscribed with the names of battle sites in France. The monument was commissioned at a cost of $7,300 by the Greenpoint Memorial Association. The Monitor and the Merrimac is a sculpture by Antonio de Filippo, which commemorates the Battle of the Monitor and Merrimack. The USS Monitor was built nearby at the Continental Iron Works in Greenpoint and outfitted at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

Biography A member of a Huguenot family, Rousseau was born at Paris. He was noted as a painter of trompe l'≈ìil, decorative landscapes and classic ruins, somewhat in the style of Canaletto, but without his delicacy of touch; he appears also to have been influenced by Nicolas Poussin and Gaspard Dughet.Nichols 1996, p. 263. While young Rousseau went to Rome, where he spent some years in painting the ancient ruins, together with the surrounding landscapes. He thus formed his style, which was artificial and conventionally decorative. His colouring for the most part is unpleasing, partly owing to his violent treatment of skies with crude blues and orange, and his chiaroscuro usually is much exaggerated. On his return to Paris he soon became distinguished as a painter, and was employed to decorate walls at the H√¥tel Lambert and for Louis XIV and Philippe d'Orleans, at the Ch√¢teau de Saint- Cloud, Palace of Versailles, Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Ch√¢teau de Marly and other locations (all destroyed except two at Versailles). He was admitted a member of the Acad√©mie de Peinture et de Sculpture on September 2, 1662, but on the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685, he was obliged to take refuge in Switzerland and Holland, and his name was struck off the Academy roll. In 1690 he was invited to England by the duke of Montague, who employed him, together with other French painters, to paint the walls of his palace, Montague House (on the site of which is now the British Museum). Rousseau was also employed to paint architectural subjects and landscapes in the palace of Hampton Court, where many of his decorative panels still exist. He spent the latter part of his life in London, where he died in 1693. Examples of his work are in the British Museum, Windsor Castle, Boughton House (Northants) and Aston Hall (Birmingham). Besides being a painter in oil and fresco Rousseau was an etcher of some ability; many etchings by his hand from the works of the Annibale Caracci and from his own designs still exist; they are vigorous, though coarse in execution. He was influenced by the painter Herman van Swanevelt, whose sister he married.Jacques Rousseau in the RKD References Sources * * Nichols, Thomas (1996). \\"Jacques Rousseau,\\" in Jane Turner, ed., Dictionary of Art, London: Macmillan Publ.

It is an immunoassay in which a drug or metabolite in the sample competes with an drug/metabolite labelled with an enzyme, to bind to an antibody. The more drug there is in the sample, the more free enzyme there will be, and the increased enzyme activity causes a change in color. Determination of drug levels in serum is particularly important when the difference in the concentrations needed to produce a therapeutic effect and adverse side reactions is small, the therapeutic window. EMIT therapeutic drug monitoring tests provide accurate information about the concentration of such drugs such as immunosuppressant drugs and some antibiotics. EMIT urine assays for drugs such as cannabinoids, morphine, and amphetamine are designed to detect the drug itself or a metabolite of the drug present in a concentration above a pre-specified minimum detection cutoff limit. In the U.S., the cutoff limits must be set in accordance with Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs that were developed by SAMHSA (The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is a branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services). The setting of reasonable cutoff limits help reduce false positive results that occur from assay limitations. Because of the social and legal consequences, a positive test result must be confirmed by an alternative method, usually Gas Chromatography/Mass spectrometry. As an example the SAMHSA cutoffs for cannabinoids are 50 ng/ml for the immunoassay and 15 ng/ml as confirmed by GC/MS.http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-08-16/pdf/2010-20095.pdf Immunoassays that do not conform with SAMHSA, featuring a cutoff of 20 ng/ml, have been shown to produce false positives from passive inhalation of marijuana smoke.

Manes (, ; January 18, 1934 ‚Äì March 13, 1986) was a Democratic Party politician from New York City. He served as borough president of the New York City borough of Queens from 1971 until just before his suicide while under suspicion of corruption in 1986.Meislin, Richard J. \\"MANES'S DEATH: A FRANTIC CALL, A FATAL THRUST\\", The New York Times, March 15, 1986. Accessed December 11, 2007. Career Elected at age 37, the Brooklyn-born Manes was the youngest borough president in Queens history. During his term, Manes turned his position from a merely ceremonial role into a more proactive political job. He was re-elected four more times, and was a delegate to the 1980 Democratic National Convention. Manes' popularity plummeted in late 1985, when he was criticized over two of his pet projects. He wanted to build a Grand Prix auto racetrack in Queens's largest public park, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, where the 1939 New York World's Fair and the 1964 New York World's Fair had been held. Community leaders denigrated the idea, and it became the first major project of his that was opposed. Also that year, Manes worked to build a domed football-baseball stadium in the park, but it was opposed by local businessmen in the Flushing area. When Queens couldn't secure a football franchise, the plan died. One of his biggest controversies came in late 1985, when Manes wanted to wire the borough for cable television. Manes rejected a proposal by the Queens-based Orth-O-Vision company to place cable lines in the borough, and instead awarded contracts to mega-companies Warner Communications and Time-Life, as well as a cable firm owned by former Manhattan borough president Percy Sutton. Local residents were outraged that he passed over a local firm for large national companies. Downfall and suicide Shortly after his inauguration for a fifth term, Manes attended a dinner party for the new Israeli consul at Borough Hall in Kew Gardens on January 9, 1986. He left in his own car and was followed by his chauffeur up Queens Boulevard. He was later found in his car in the early morning hours of January 10; his wrists were slit and he was bleeding profusely. He initially claimed that two men had carjacked and attacked him, but later recanted the statement, saying he had attempted suicide. In the following weeks, it was alleged that Manes had used political appointments and favors as the source of large kickback schemes involving personal bureaucratic fiefdoms such as the New York City Parking Violations Bureau. In 1978, Manes installed a friend, Geoffrey Lindenauer, who later cooperated with prosecutors, as the deputy head of the Parking Violations Bureau. With Manes‚Äô help, Lindenauer steered collections of parking fines to a company that paid the two bribes of up to $2,500 per month by 1982. Later in 1982, Manes, Lindenauer and Bronx Democratic Party President Stanley Friedman each received shares in a company called Citisource, which won a city contract to develop a handheld parking ticket computer. Manes also accepted bribes from SRS, a company also involved in parking ticket collections, whose owner also cooperated with authorities. Columnist Jimmy Breslin on January 23, 1986, published a story in which the head of a third parking collections company confessed to paying $36,000 in bribes to Manes. Zoning and cable TV franchises were being investigated, and some of Manes' appointees and associates were indicted or forced to resign. Manes' deputy Claire Shulman was installed as acting Borough President on January 28 and he formally resigned on February 11. The scandal became nationwide news and a continuing top story in New York City. Manes, now facing the prospect of indictment on corruption charges, stayed in seclusion until March. On the night of March 13, he took a phone call from his psychiatrist, who discussed additional care with Manes (and his wife on an extension phone upstairs). Shortly before 10 p.m. the psychiatrist was called away from the phone and, while on hold, Manes reached into a kitchen drawer, pulled out a large kitchen knife and plunged the eight- inch blade into his heart. His daughter screamed for her mother, who came down to find Manes on the floor in a pool of blood. Marlene Manes pulled the knife from his heart as their daughter frantically called 911. Donald Manes was pronounced dead at the scene. Less than three years later, on November 17, 1988, Morton Manes, Donald Manes' twin brother, attempted suicide in the same manner. He died of a heart attack at the age of 70 in May 2004. Manes was buried at Mt. Ararat Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York. Manes' successor, Claire Shulman, served as Borough President until 2002.

He translated the sonnets and some other of the works of William Shakespeare, English poetry (including poems for children), and poetry from other languages. Maxim Gorky proclaimed Marshak to be \\"the founder of Russia's (Soviet) children's literature.\\" Early years Marshak was born to a Jewish family on 3 November 1887 in Voronezh.Samuil Marshak. An anthology of Jewish-Russian literature. Maxim Shrayer. p. 192. (M.E. Sharpe February 15, 2007) Google Books His father was a foreman at a soap-making plant. He had a good home education and later studied at the gymnasium (secondary school) of Ostrogozhsk, a suburb of Voronezh. He started to write poetry during his childhood years in Voronezh. His brother Ilya (who wrote under the pseudonym M. Ilin) (1896‚Äî1953) and sister Liya (who wrote as Elena Ilina) (1901‚Äî1964) also both became Soviet authors. In 1902, the Marshak family moved to Saint Petersburg. There was a complication: as a Jew, Marshak could not legally live outside the Pale of Settlement, thus he could not attend school while living in the city. Philanthropist and scholar Baron David Gunzburg took an interest in Marshak and introduced him to the influential critic Vladimir Stasov. Stasov was so impressed by the schoolboy's literary talent that he arranged an exception from the Pale laws for Samuil and his family. He also introduced Marshak to Maxim Gorky and Feodor Chaliapin.115th birth anniversary of famous poet and translator Samuil Marshak. RIA Novosti. November 03, 2002. In 1904, Samuil was diagnosed with tuberculosis and could no longer continue to live in the cold climate of Saint Petersburg. Maxim Gorky arranged for Samuil to live with his family in the Black Sea resort town of Yalta (1904‚Äì1907). Gorky and Chaliapin also paid for his education and therapy. However, he spent much of this period in Kerch, living with the Fremerman family. Young poet, philosopher and translator In 1904, he published his first works in the magazine Jewish Life and in the mid- to late 1900s, Marshak created a body of Zionist verse, some of which appeared in such periodicals as Young Judea. In 1907 he returned to Saint Petersburg and subsequently published numerous works in the popular magazine Satyricon. Marshak failed to gain admission at a university in Russia due to 'political insecurity' and earned his living giving lessons and writing for magazines. From his first trip to the Middle East he brought back many impressions, poems and a beautiful wife. In 1912 he moved to England and studied philosophy at the University of London. He fell in love with English culture and with poetry written in English. In his senior year at the University he published his translations of the poems written by William Blake, Robert Burns and William Wordsworth, published in Russia. His 1913 visit to an experimental \\"free\\" school in Wales (led by the Tolstoyan Philip Oyler) is noted as the event that sparked his professional interest in children. Shortly before World War I, in 1914, he returned to Russia and devoted himself to translation. Children's poetry In 1914 Marshak and his wife worked with children of Jewish refugees in Voronezh. The death of Marshak's young daughter in 1915 directed him toward children's literature. In 1920 he moved to Ekaterinodar (now Krasnodar) to head the province's orphanages and it was there that he and a group of enthusiasts, including Elena Vasilieva, organized Children's town that included a children's theater, library, and studios. For this theater, he co-wrote plays that later became the book Theater for Children. In 1922, Marshak moved back to what was then Petrograd to become the head of the Children's Literature Studio. He published the following works at the publishing house \\"–†–∞–¥—É–≥–∞\\" (\\"Rainbow\\"): –î–µ—Ç–∫–∏ –≤ –∫–ª–µ—Ç–∫–µ (Kids in a cage), –ü–æ–∂–∞—Ä (Fire) 1923, –°–∫–∞–∑–∫–∞ –æ –≥–ª—É–ø–æ–º –º—ã—à–æ–Ω–∫–µ (The Tale of a Silly Mouse), –°–∏–Ω—è—è –ø—Ç–∏—Ü–∞ (Blue bird), –¶–∏—Ä–∫ (Circus), –ú–æ—Ä–æ–∂–µ–Ω–æ–µ (Ice Cream), –í—á–µ—Ä–∞ –∏ —Å–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è¬ª (Yesterday and today) 1925, –ë–∞–≥–∞–∂ (Luggage) 1926, –ü—É–¥–µ–ª—å (Poodle), –ü–æ—á—Ç–∞ (Post Office) 1927, and –í–æ—Ç –∫–∞–∫–æ–π —Ä–∞—Å—Å–µ—è–Ω–Ω—ã–π (What an absent-minded guy) 1930. Marshak had a prolific career in children's literature. Soviet critic Viktor Shklovsky wrote that \\"Samuil Marshak understood that many new writers would appear in the new Soviet republic. He stood at the door of literature, a benevolent angel, armed not with a sword or with a pencil, but with words on work and inspiration.\\" Marshak's contributions to the field of children's literature was not just limited to his own writings. In 1924, he became the head of the children's branch of the state publishing house Gosizdat (GIZ), a position he held for over a decade. Through his role as editor, Marshak attracted some of Russia's best writers to try their hand at writing for children, including Evgeniy Shvarts and OBERIU member Daniil Kharms.  Translations  Among his Russian translations there are William Shakespeare's sonnets and songs from Shakespeare's plays, The Merry Wives of Windsor (together with Mikhail Morozov, who translated prosaic scenes), poems of Robert Burns, William Blake, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, William Wordsworth, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Robert Browning, Robert Louis Stevenson, W. B. Yeats, Edward Lear, Lewis Carroll, Rudyard Kipling, T. S. Eliot, A. A. Milne, English and Scottish folk ballads, poems from Nursery rhymes. Besides English poetry, he translated poems of Heinrich Heine, S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi, Gianni Rodari and Hovhannes Tumanyan. English Poetry in Russian Translations. Moscow, 1981. P. 606. William Shakespeare. Full Collection of Works in Eight Volumes. Volume 4. Moscow, 1959. Pages 249-369. His main work in this area is translation of Shakespeare's sonnets (1948). This translation has enjoyed great success over the years. Some Shakespeare sonnets in Marshak's translation have been set to music (in classical style by Dmitry Kabalevsky, in pop style by Tikhon Khrennikov, Mikael Tariverdiev, Alla Pugacheva and others, even in rock style ‚Äî Kruiz). His translations are considered classics in Russia. But many of Marshak's poetic translations became so entrenched in Russian culture, that it was often quipped that he was not so much a translator as a co-author. Later years In 1937 Marshak moved to Moscow, where he worked on children's books and translations. During World War II, he published satires against the Nazis. After the war he continued to publish children's books including: –†–∞–∑–Ω–æ—Ü–≤–µ—Ç–Ω–∞—è –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞ (Multicolored book) 1948, –ö—Ä—É–≥–ª—ã–π –≥–æ–¥ (All year round) 1948, –¢–∏—Ö–∞—è —Å–∫–∞–∑–∫–∞ (A Quiet tale) 1956, etc. In the last years of his life, he wrote aphoristic verses that he named lyrical epigrams. They were published in his last book, Selected Lyrics (–ò–∑–±—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–∞—è –õ–∏—Ä–∏–∫–∞) in 1963. He also published three tale plays: The Twelve Months 1943, Afraid of Troubles - Cannot Have Luck 1962, and Smart Things 1964. Although not widely known, in the Soviet era, Marshak was on a (political) razor's edge and barely escaped death in 1937. His name was often mentioned in the documents of the eliminated Jewish Anti- Fascist Committee. However, the process of the committee ended in August 1952 (12 executed and 98 subjected to repression) and Marshak was not accused. History of Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee In 1953 with the death of Josef Stalin and the onset of Khrushchev Thaw Marshak was out of danger. There is an opinion that Stalin's death saved Marshak from inevitable death in the period of the fight against cosmopolitism. Samuil Marshak died on 4 July 1964 and was buried in Moscow.

The duo consists of Marilyn Kentz and Caryl Kristensen, who met as neighbors in Petaluma, California in the late 1980s. It was their family and friends that convinced them that they should take a chance and start an act because they had a knack for comedy. Their act caught the attention of NBC, who saw potential in the team after one of the executives caught their performance on a TV show. They eventually signed a contract for a television show with NBC. The duo later hosted a talk show on ABC. TV series In 1993 they landed their first major starring roles in The Mommies, a series loosely based on their family life and experiences as suburban neighbors in Petaluma, California. The series ran on NBC for two seasons, with 38 episodes made. It was produced by Paramount Network Television. Caryl & Marilyn: Real Friends In 1996 the duo returned to TV with a daytime talk show called Caryl & Marilyn: Real Friends. The show was produced by Viacom Productions (now CBS Television Distribution) and aired on ABC for one year before being replaced by The View in 1997. The Mommies: A Musical Blog Kentz and Kristensen contributed lyrics to a musical called The Mommies: A Musical Blog, which is advertised as a \\"90-minute party of laughter (and a few tears) that will remind you of all the reasons you became a mommie!\\" It premiered in Orlando, Florida in 2011.

Her mother, Mei-no-Iratsume (also known as Soga- hime), was a daughter of Udaijin Soga-no-Kura-no-Yamada-no-Ishikawa-no-Maro (also known as Soga Yamada-no ≈å-omi). =Events of Genmei's life= Genmei became the consort (ny≈çgo) of Crown Prince Kusakabe no Miko, who was the son of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jit≈ç. After the death of their son Emperor Monmu in 707, she acceded to the throne.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 56. At least one account suggests that she accepted the role of empress because Emperor Mommu felt his young son, her grandson, was still too young to withstand the pressures which attend becoming emperor.Titsingh, p. 63. * July 18, 707 (Keiun 4, 15th day of the 6th month): In the 11th year of Mommu-tenn≈ç 's reign (ÊñáÊ≠¶Â§©ÁöáÂçÅ‰∏ÄÂπ¥), the emperor died; and the succession (senso) was received by the emperor's mother, who held the throne in trust for her young grandson.

In the last years of the Mommu's reign, the extensive preparations for this projected move had begun; but the work could not be completed before the late-emperor's death. Shortly after the neng≈ç was changed to Wad≈ç, an Imperial Rescript was issued concerning the establishment of a new capital at the Heij≈ç-ky≈ç at Nara in Yamato Province. It had been customary since ancient times for the capital to be moved with the beginning of each new reign. However, Emperor Mommu decided not to move the capital, preferring instead to stay at the Fujiwara Palace which had been established by Empress Jit≈ç.Varley, p. 140. Empress Genmei's palace was named Nara-no-miya. * 711 (Wad≈ç 4, 3rd month): The Kojiki was published in three volumes. This work presented a history of Japan from a mythological period of god-rulers up through the 28th day of the 1st month of the fifth year of Empress Suiko's reign (597). Emperor Tenmu failed to bring the work to completion before his death in 686. Empress Genmei, along with other court officials, deserve credit for continuing to patronize and encourage the mammoth project. * 712 (Wad≈ç 5): The Mutsu Province was separated from Dewa Province. * 713 (Wad≈ç 6, 3rd month): Tanba Province was separated from Tango Province; Mimasaka Province was divided from Bizen Province; and Hy≈´ga Province was divided from ≈åsumi Province. * 713 (Wad≈ç 6): The compilation of Fudoki was begun with the imprimatur of an Imperial decree; and copies of the census of the provinces of Izumo, Harima, Hitachi and two other provinces still exist.

After Empress Genmei transferred the seat of her government to Nara, this mountain location remained the capital throughout the succeeding seven reigns. In a sense, the years of the Nara period developed into one of the more significant consequences of her comparatively short reign. Genmei had initially planned to remain on the throne until her grandson might reach maturity. However, in 715, Genmei did abdicate in favor of Mommu's older sister who then became known as Empress Gensh≈ç. Gensh≈ç was eventually succeeded by her nephew, who then became known as Emperor Sh≈çmu. * 715 (Wad≈ç 8): Genmei resigns as empress in favor of her daughter, who will be known as Empress Gensh≈ç.Titsingh, pp. 64‚Äì65. The Empress reigned for eight years. Although there were seven other reigning empresses, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century.Yoshida, Reiji. \\"Life in the Cloudy Imperial Fishbowl,\\" Japan Times. March 27, 2007; retrieved 2013-8-22. Empress Genmei, who was followed on the throne by her daughter, remains the sole exception to this conventional argument. After abdicating, she was known as Daij≈ç-tenn≈ç; and she was only the second woman after Empress Jit≈ç to claim this title. Genmei lived in retirement for seven years until her death at the age of 61. The actual site of Genmei's grave is known. This empress is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Genmei's mausoleum. Genmei's Imperial misasagi or mausoleum can be visited today in Narazaka-cho, Nara City.Naracity Tourist Association: Genmei's misasagi ‚Äì image; Genmei's misasagi ‚Äì map The \\"mountain shape\\" misasagi was named Nahoyama-no-higashi no misasagi.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard.

Schulz. It originally aired on the CBS network on April 16, 1984. The special is presented as an original musical which features parodies of the early 1980s breakdancing craze, MTV, the movies Saturday Night Fever, Flashdance, and Footloose, and a number of popular top 40 hit songs of the early 1980s. It has been released to DVD by Warner Home Video as a bonus feature to Snoopy's Reunion. Inspiration After seeing the film Flashdance on its initial release, Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz decided to draw a parody-tribute to what he saw with Snoopy performing as the \\"flashdancer\\", sporting the same dance clothes worn by the main character Alex (Jennifer Beals); in a November 29, 1983 comic strip that later led to the idea of turning it into an animated TV special. Plot It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown takes the form of a musical, presenting a series of different songs. The program does not have a strong unifying plot. The program begins with Snoopy defeating Peppermint Patty at football, followed by an opening credits sequence in which the dog takes out a boom box and dances to the title song as the opening credits roll. The next segment shows Peppermint Patty and Marcie at school, followed by a gym class, in which Peppermint Patty leads the other characters in a workout while she sings \\"I'm in Shape\\". The part of the song where she sings \\"Hey Linus...!\\" is clearly inspired by Toni Basil's 1982 hit song \\"Mickey\\". The scene changes to a party at the home of Sally and Charlie Brown. The children begin playing a game of \\"Simon Says\\" before Lucy takes over the game and sings \\"Lucy Says\\". Later, the children dance to a song about \\"Pig-Pen\\", \\"The Pig-Pen Hoedown\\". The song \\"Flashbeagle\\" is repeated two more times. Snoopy is first seen selecting outfits, finally deciding on an old T-shirt which he rips part of to form a headband and leg warmers, then heading to a discoth√®que with Franklin and dancing to the tune there, where the first two verses of the song are played, and Snoopy wins applause from the club-goers to the background of multicolored lights. The next morning, Snoopy is sleeping atop his doghouse exhausted from the night before, to which Charlie Brown berates him for oversleeping while others work. Sally Brown takes a groggy Snoopy to school for Show and Tell. After one boy talks about his pet chameleon, Sally is up, but Snoopy lies there motionless. However, when the owner of the chameleon plays his boom box which has the third and final verse of \\"Flashbeagle\\" Snoopy gets up and starts dancing, and all the children gradually join in. The special ends with Charlie Brown saying to his sister that he thinks he should do something about his dog's behavior. Sally disagrees with him because, thanks to Snoopy, she got an \\"A\\" (for the first time) for Show and Tell. Production Bill Melendez explained that the dancing Snoopy in the club scene was done by a process called rotoscoping where the character is drawn over live-action pictures. Marine Jahan, the stunt dancer from Flashdance, was chosen to do scenes where Snoopy was dancing in the special. The animators rotoscoped live-action pictures of Jahan to Snoopy in order to make these scenes. Charles Schulz's 12-year-old daughter Jill was said to have inspired the \\"She's In Shape\\" sequence when Schulz drew images. The cast of this special (except Gary Goren) would work on the second season of The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show.

Invented by the German physicist Philipp von Jolly in 1864, it consists of a spring fastened at the top to a movable arm. At the lower end, the spring is provided with two small pans, one suspended beneath the other. The lower pan is kept immersed to the same depth in water, while the other one hangs in the air. On the upright stand behind the spring is a mirror on which is engraved or painted a scale of equal parts.

The bridge was initially called the \\"St. Louis Municipal Bridge\\" and known popularly as the \\"Free Bridge\\" due to the original lack of tolls. Tolls were added for auto traffic beginning in 1932. In 1942, the bridge was renamed for Douglas MacArthur. The bridge was constructed to break the monopoly of the Terminal Railroad Association, which controlled two other bridges at St. Louis and charged what were viewed as unreasonable tolls. Upon completion, the structure was the largest double-deck steel bridge in the world.  History  Following a 1906 Congressional bill authorizing the City of St. Louis to build a new Mississippi River Bridge, bonds were issued for an initial amount of $3.5 million. Construction on the bridge began 1909, however, money ran out before the bridge approaches could be finished. This led to a second bond issuance of $2.75 million in 1914, and the bridge did not open until 1917, when it automobile traffic first began to use it. Railroad traffic would not use the bridge's lower deck until 1928. The bridge was built by Missouri Valley Bridge & Iron Co. and American Bridge Company, with the design completed by Boller & Hodge. From 1929 through 1955, the MacArthur Bridge carried U.S. Highway 66 until the completion of the nearby Poplar Street Bridge. At one time, U.S. Highway 460 crossed the bridge, terminating on the west side of the bridge. In 1981 the bridge was closed to vehicles because of pavement deterioration and the eastern ramp approaches were torn out. The bridge is now in use only by railroads. The disused vehicle deck has been removed. By 2007, only about 30% of the total deck reserved for automobile use had been removed. Most of the removed sections were on the East St. Louis side. The western ramp was relinquished to Ralston Purina and turned into a parking lot. In 2013 the TRRA began removing all of the auto deck over the river. By late 2014, the vehicle deck on the bridge proper had been removed, and work was progressing onto the western approach. In 1989, the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis acquired the MacArthur Bridge from the City of St. Louis in exchange for the title to the Eads Bridge. The Eads bridge, one of the primary reasons for the TRRA's original formation, had become obsolete for modern-day rail traffic due to the height restrictions it placed on rail cars.Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis - TRRA History The MacArthur Bridge continues to be the vital railroad link connecting west to east for a large number of commodities, and bulk cargo. In 2012, it was the 17th busiest railroad bridge in the United States.

His writings were frequently characterized by the Norwegian romantic nationalism common to the age. Background Storm was from V√•g√• in Oppland, Norway. He was the son of Johan Storm (1712‚Äì76), the parish priest at V√•g√• Church, and his second wife, Ingeborg Birgitta R√∏ring (1718‚Äì1760). The early years of his life were spent in the V√•g√• Rectory (V√•g√•kyrkja). He began formal schooling in 1756 in Christiania (now Oslo). In 1765 he took the entry examination for Copenhagen University, but waited until later to enter. For a period he was a teacher in Lesja, but he returned for 1766‚Äì1769 in his childhood home. In July 1769, Storm left home to begin serious study in Copenhagen. It is commonly thought he pursued theology but he never took the official examination. Despite being from Norway, he did not join the Norske Selskab, a literary club formed in 1772 for Norwegian students in Copenhagen which included authors, poets and philosophers. Storm was an admirer of the Danish poet Johannes Ewald and attached himself to Ewald's circle of friends who were members. While in Denmark he wrote nine songs in local Norwegian dialect before the beginning of the 1770s. These songs were among the seminal works of Norwegian literature in dialect and are often viewed as the best that Storm wrote. Edward Storm's tombstone at Assistens Cemetery in Copenhagen Career Storm returned to his home district in about 1785. From this point forward his work with education was of considerable value. In 1786, a circle of the area's more important men created a secondary school for children (folk school). Storm was a member of the group and came to play an important role in the administration of the school. Among the tasks to which the group dedicated its work was the important establishment of a middle school for children, and in this connection popular lectures were presented for older children and young people on topics from various scientific disciplines. Storm lectured four hours a week on lifemanship (), geography, the Danish language, linguistics as well as both Greek and Norse mythologies. Starting in 1790, his ties to the school were more formal as he became a head inspector of sorts. One month before his death he got appointed to be one of the directing managers of the Royal Danish Theatre. He was buried at Assistens Cemetery in Copenhagen. His work included Zinklars vise (\\"Ballad of Sinclair\\") written in 1781, celebrating the defeat of a force of Scottish mercenaries led by George Sinclair, a nephew of the Earl of Caithness under the commander of Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Ramsay. Local forces were in part inspired by a local peasant girl, Prillar-Guri. The Scots were ambushed in an engagement referred to as the Battle of Kringen.East Norway and its Frontier by Frank Noel Stagg, George Allen & Unwin, Ltd. 1956The Heart of Norway by Frank Noel Stagg, George Allen & Unwin, Ltd., 1953.

He commanded the escort group of the ill-fated Arctic Convoy PQ 17 in 1942. After the Second World War, he became a writer and illustrator. Early career He was born in 1901 in Seattle, Washington, to Louis Egerton Broome...son of Frederick Napier Broome and Mary Anne Barker and Clara Kathleen (Aim√©e) Lake. His father was an English adventurer who had joined the gold rush to the Klondike. He accompanied his parents to Panama in 1907, but returned to England where he was raised largely by his mother's relatives. He attended Oakwood School, Surrey and in 1912, entered the Royal Naval College at Osborne. From Osborne, he passed in 1915 to the senior College at Dartmouth. World War I and between the Wars In 1917 he was posted as a midshipman to the battleship Colossus in the Grand Fleet. Shortly after the end of the War, he was promoted Sub-Lieutenant and served in the destroyer HMS Clematis in the Red Sea and at Aden. From there he attended Trinity Hall, Cambridge,\\"Convoy is to scatter\\", pp. 22‚Äì24 and after graduating in 1923, chose to serve in submarines. By this time, his talent as a cartoonist and wag was well established. He served in several submarines from 1923 to 1938, except for two short spells on the capital ships HMS Tiger and HMS Royal Oak. Much of this period was spent at the Hong Kong naval station. He married Sybil Nicholas in 1928, with whom he had a son and a daughter. He reached the rank of commander in 1936, while commanding the submarine, HMS Rainbow. In 1938, he attended a staff course at the Royal Naval College at Greenwich. Second World War Broome was judged to be too old in 1939 to command a submarine in wartime. Instead, he was given command of the destroyer HMS Veteran recommissioned from reserve. Characteristically, Broome applied for membership of the Company of Veteran Motorists, who made the ship a life member. HMS Veteran served in the Norwegian campaign in 1940. While there, her bridge was adorned with a huge stuffed hippopotamus head, acquired by Broome from Formby Golf Club during a spree ashore. Broome also acquired a German torpedo, which had missed its target and run onto the shore of a fjord. Suitably covered in German graffiti, it was eventually handed to the authorities in Rosyth. After the end of the Norwegian campaign, Veteran was assigned to counter a threatened German invasion, and was damaged by an acoustic mine. With Veteran laid up for extensive repairs, Broome was then assigned as Staff Officer to Admiral Sir Percy Noble, the Commander-in-Chief of the Western Approaches Command. Broome's cartoons enlivened many drab briefing rooms and dreary routine reports. After several months in this duty, he temporarily served as Captain (D) at the base at Londonderry Port in Derry and then commanded the First Escort Group, (EG1) in the destroyer . For most of 1941 and 1942, HMS Keppel was engaged in arduous convoy duties in the Atlantic. One brief stay at Lisahally was enlivened by the capture of a German spy who was attempting to escape to the Irish Free State in a stolen motor boat. PQ 17 Then in June 1942, EG1 was assigned to protect Convoy PQ 17, sailing from Hvalfjord in Iceland to Murmansk in Russia. The Arctic convoys were reckoned to be very hazardous missions, as they faced not only U-Boats but also German aircraft and surface ships, including the powerful battleship Tirpitz. A squadron of British and American cruisers was assigned to protect the convoy, and the Home Fleet, with its battleships and aircraft carriers was at sea, but distant. On 4 July 1942, PQ 17 was attacked several times by torpedo-carrying German aircraft. Three merchant ships were lost, but four aircraft were shot down, and several others damaged. At this point, Admiral Dudley Pound, the First Sea Lord, fearing that Tirpitz was about to attack, sent three fateful signals: *2111: Most Immediate. Cruiser Force withdraw to westward at high speed *2123: Immediate. Owing to threat from surface ships convoy is to disperse and proceed to Russian ports *2136: Most Immediate. My 2123. Convoy is to scatter The rising tone of panic in these messages convinced Broome and every other recipient that Tirpitz was approaching. Since the first of the messages was not directly addressed to Broome, he was not immediately aware that the cruisers were withdrawing. In fact, although they should have been out of sight of the convoy, because of navigational errors they were clearly visible as they worked up to full speed. Convinced that the cruisers were about to engage enemy ships, Broome collected the miscellany of destroyers in EG1 and attached them to the cruisers, while the convoy scattered. A day later, it became clear that the threat from German surface ships did not exist, and that the scattered ships of the convoy were being picked off individually by U-boats and aircraft. It was by then too late to reform the convoy; Broome's destroyers were low on fuel after their high-speed dash in company with the cruisers, and the oilers which had accompanied the convoy had themselves been sunk. Twenty-one of the convoy's thirty-five ships were sunk following the order to scatter. The Royal Navy felt themselves disgraced by the unhappy episode. Later that year, the First Lord of the Admiralty, A. V. Alexander paid a visit to HMS Keppel. Broome asked the reason why PQ 17 was scattered but received no satisfactory answer. Later naval career After a brief spell in the Mediterranean, during which EG1 played a peripheral part in Operation Pedestal, HMS Keppel was paid off late in 1942. Broome was surprised to be promoted to captain, and also awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1943. (Broome was aware that not only was anyone connected with PQ 17 liable to have that episode on their record, but also that his habit of drawing and circulating acerbic caricatures of senior officers had made him unpopular with some.) He commanded the escort carrier HMS Begum in 1942‚Äì1944. Begum served with the Eastern Fleet. Her aircraft sank a particularly troublesome U-Boat in the Indian Ocean late in 1944, for which Broome was Mentioned in Dispatches. He was also awarded the Burma Star for his service in Indian waters. He was commandant of a shore establishment at Portsmouth, HMS Vernon II in 1945 before being appointed captain of the aged battleship HMS Ramillies in 1945‚Äì1946. Writer and cartoonist Broome retired from the Royal Navy in 1947. From 1947 to 1951, he busied himself as editor of the Sketch Magazine. He wrote a number of books on naval subjects, and edited and illustrated several humorous collections of naval signals. He was also a founder member of the Lord's Taverners Cricket Club. He was naval advisor for several films, including The Cruel Sea. Actor Jack Hawkins apparently based his portrayal of the fictional Lieutenant Commander George Erickson on Broome. He also wrote television and film scripts. He and his first wife divorced in 1954, and he subsequently married Joan Featherstonhaugh Crisp. Towards the end of his life, he was able to see Richard Briers play him in a TV play about PQ 17. Libel case In 1968, David Irving published a controversial book about PQ 17. It concentrated on Allied blunders and shortcomings, alleging that Broome's decision to withdraw his destroyers was the primary cause of the disaster to the convoy. Broome mounted a libel action to defend his reputation. He was successful, winning ¬£40,000 in damages and securing the withdrawal of all copies of the offending book from circulation (it has since been republished, with corrections.) The damages payment (donated by Broome to charity) was the highest paid in legal history until Jeffrey Archer's controversial action against the Daily Star newspaper.

It is found throughout Southeast Asia, including Brunei, Cambodia, Java, Sumatra, Borneo, the Lesser Sunda Islands, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Myanmar and Vietnam. It prefers forested habitats (primary, secondary, and scrub forest) and plantations (rubber, palm oil). A large part of its life is spent in trees. Taxonomy In the past, this species has included the closely related Palawan pangolin (M. culionensis), as both are in the subgenus Paramanis. It is closely related to the Chinese pangolin, although the Malayan species is larger, lighter in colour, and has shorter fore claws. Description The skin of the Sunda pangolin's feet is granular, although pads are found on its front feet. It has thick and powerful claws to dig into the soils in search of ant nests or to tear into termite mounds. The Sunda pangolin has poor eyesight, but a highly developed sense of smell. Lacking teeth, its long, sticky tongue serves to collect ants and termites. Its body is covered by rows of scales and fibrous hair. The head-body length of this pangolin can measure 40‚Äì65 cm, tail length is 35‚Äì56 cm, and its weight is up to 10 kg. Males are larger than females. Behaviour and ecology Pangolins give birth annually to one or two offspring. They breed in the autumn, and females give birth in the winter burrow. Den preference has been known to shift at this time to favor mature forest tree hollows. Presumably, these hollows offer more fortification and stability for the decreased mobility that comes with birthing and caring for young. The amount of time the mother will spend at any one of these dens will increase during parental care periods. Parental care is given for about three months. In these three months, the range of the mother Pangolin drastically decreases as she travels and forages with her offspring. Only a few weeks before the offspring becomes fully independent, the mother and her young can display brief spikes in diurnal activity. Pangolins are sometimes found in pairs, but normally they are solitary, nocturnal, and behave timidly. They protect their soft underparts by rolling into balls when they feel threatened. They are strong diggers and make burrows lined with vegetation for insulation near termite mounds and ant nests. Sunda pangolins have low immunity, making them sensitive to fluctuations in temperature. The Sunda pangolin's main predators are humans, tigers, and the clouded leopard. Conservation Pangolins as a genus are among the most heavily poached and exploited protected animals. Like other pangolin species, the Sunda pangolin is hunted for its skin, scales, and meat, used in clothing manufacture and traditional medicine. Scales are made into rings as charms against rheumatic fever, and meat is eaten by indigenous peoples. Despite enjoying protected status almost everywhere in its range, illegal international trade, largely driven by Chinese buyers, has led to rapidly decreasing population numbers. The Sunda pangolin is currently considered to be critically endangered. As of 2016, all pangolin species, including the Sunda pangolin, are listed by CITES in its Appendix I, which prohibits international trade in wild-caught specimens or their body parts. China raised the protection status of all pangolin species, including the Sunda pangolin, to the highest level in 2020. Potential zoonosis A metagenomic study published in 2019 previously revealed that SARS-CoV, the strain of the virus that causes SARS, was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of Sunda pangolins. On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from Guangzhou had discovered a pangolin sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \\"99% identical\\" to SARS-CoV-2. When released, the results clarified that \\"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one amino acid difference.\\" Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their poaching and trading for use in traditional Chinese medicine remains common. Microbiologists and geneticists in Texas have independently found evidence of reassortment in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2. However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2. This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002‚Äì2004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known civet coronavirus.

The series tells the story of a 21st-century Hong Kong VIPPU officer who travels back in time to the Warring States period of ancient China. He is involved in a number of important historical events that leads to the first unification of China under the Qin dynasty. The series' first original broadcast ran from 15 October to 7 December 2001 on the TVB Jade network in Hong Kong. A film sequel to the series, titled Back to the Past, is currently in post-production. Plot =21st century Hong Kong= Hong Siu-lung is a 21st-century VIPPU special agent in Hong Kong. In the first episode, Hong and his colleagues stand guard at an exhibition of the First Emperor's Terracotta Army. One of Hong's colleagues notices that one of the terracotta warriors bears a striking resemblance to Hong. Moments later, wealthy businessman Lee Siu-chiu is attacked and held hostage at the museum by a madman who had suffered losses in the stock market. Hong rescues Lee and defuses the crisis. Hong is unhappy despite his success in his career. He has just broken up with his girlfriend, Chun Ching, after a seven-year-long relationship. She insisted that they wed but he preferred to continue their relationship without a proper marriage. Chun married another man and Hong becomes depressed. =Time travelling= Impressed with Hong's rescue attempt, Lee Siu-chiu and Doctor Wu Yau recruit him for a secret time-travelling experiment. Hong agrees to help them in exchange for an opportunity to travel back in time to salvage his failed relationship with Chun Ching. He is tasked to travel back more than two thousand years to the Qin dynasty, half an hour prior to the coronation of Ying Ching in 247 BC, and document the event with a digital camera before a swift departure. However, a critical error occurs during the traveling stage and Hong is sent further back in time three years earlier than originally planned. He is now trapped in the Zhao state of the Warring States period in 250 BC. In order to return to the future, Hong has to make an arduous journey across thousands of miles in ancient China to activate a device at a specific location and time. He was warned that making even a slight change in the grand scheme of events will trigger a chain reaction of catastrophes that will alter history. =Warring States Period= Hong enjoys a series of adventures in history. His knowledge of the 21st century, intelligence and experience as an elite special agent, as well as his prowess in martial arts, enables him to make a strong stand in history. He enters the service of various lords and nobles, and becomes a valuable ally to them. Concurrently, he becomes involved in romantic relationships with four women. The first, Sin-yau, is a wandering female assassin and the first person he meets after travelling back in time. The second, Wu Ting-fong, is the beautiful but spoiled daughter of a wealthy noble. The third is a pretty female scholar named Kam Ching, who resembles his 21st century girlfriend Chun Ching in appearance and shares a similar name (completely homophonic in Standard Mandarin). The last is Princess Chiu Sin, the daughter of the king of Zhao, who dies in a tragic incident later. He also befriends the king's sister Chiu Nga and her son Chiu Poon. Meanwhile, he foils the evil plans of Chiu Muk, a secret agent from the Chu state, and becomes Chiu's enemy. Chiu Muk's henchman Lin Chun also sees Hong as his greatest rival. =Destiny= Ying sees Hong as a valuable ally in his future endeavors and wants to retain him as an adviser. However, Hong begins to feel regret when he sees the evil creation of his efforts, fulfilling the predestination paradox.

Ying sends his troops to pursue Hong and eventually decides to exile Hong and decrees that the name \\"Hong Siu-lung\\" shall henceforth be purged from history.

This was the last television drama that Louis Koo acted in, as he had decided to concentrate on his film career. He has since worked on films such as Election and its sequel. Raymond Lam, in his first major role, was highly praised for his breakthrough performance as Ying Ching, and rose to fame quickly. He has starred in numerous leading roles ever since. While filming in Zhuozhou, Hebei, Jessica Hsuan was stricken with cholera, causing her to enter a local hospital. Alt URL She remained in bed for over a month until she was able to leave and start filming again. This caused Hsuan's character to be absent for a while in the series. During her hospital stay, many of her co-stars, including Koo, visited her regularly. After its 2005 midnight re-run, TVB decided to release the complete series on DVD and VCD for the first time on November 18 in the same year. It also became the second TVB drama to be released on DVD after War and Beauty, and the first to receive a non-limited release. Film adaptation In May 2015, Koo's film production studio One Cool Film Productions announced that it has obtained the rights to adapt the series into a full-length feature film. Koo, who will also produce the film, confirmed that he will reprise his role as Hong Siu-lung. In March 2018, One Cool Film Productions confirmed that it has cast Lam and Hsuan to reprise their roles as Ying Ching and Wu Ting- fong, respectively. Jack Lai was hired to direct, and the film title was announced to be Back to the Past. A year later in March 2019, Back to the Past held its first press conference, also announcing that Kwok, Tang, and Saram will be returning, though it was not specified if they will be reprising their original roles. Ng Yuen-fai will co-direct alongside Lai. The film will be set 19 years after the events of the original television series.

The principal author was Sir Ronald Dearing, the Chancellor of the University of Nottingham. It made 93 recommendations concerning the funding, expansion, and maintenance of academic standards. The most significant change in funding recommended by the report is a shift from undergraduate tuition being funded entirely by grants from the government to a mixed system in which tuition fees, supported by low interest government loans, are raised. The report recommended expansion of sub-degree courses, and degree level courses at university, proposing that there was sufficient demand from employers for applicants with higher qualifications for natural growth of higher education. To the maintenance of standards the report recommended that the teaching staff receive some amount of training in teaching during their probationary period.

As of 2010, it has been replaced by the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) in all states and territories (including Queensland as of 2020).  Usage  All states in Australia used some form of TER in the 1970s onwards, based upon an aggregated scaling procedure that differed in each jurisdiction. Prior to this, admission to university was based upon a pass/fail criterion for school leavers. The TER was used by university institutions until 2000, where it was replaced by a similar ranking scheme known as the UAI. Equivalence The TER was used in Victoria (1994-1998), South Australia, the Northern Territory, Tasmania Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory Universities Admissions Centre (June, 2009). Although directly equivalent to the Equivalent National Tertiary Entrance Rank (ENTER) in Victoria, and the Universities Admission Index (UAI) in New South Wales and later adopted in the Australian Capital Territory, the terms ENTER and UAI were only used in their respective states or territories. Calculation of the TER in South Australia and the Northern Territory The TER was accumulated by the South Australian Tertiary Admissions Centre (SATAC) for students who successfully completed the South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE) or the Northern Territory Certificate of Education (NTCE) and fulfilled other criteria to qualify for a TER. In South Australia, students' subject achievement scores (out of 20) were forwarded to SATAC by the Senior Secondary Assessment Board of South Australia (SSABSA), whereupon they were scaled (adjusted according to the level of performance in the group of students studying the subject in that year to ensure that each subject contributes equally to the TER). The university aggregate was then calculated by adding: * the scaled scores for the best four subjects, * 50% of the scaled score for the next best (fifth) subject. The university aggregates (out of 90) were ordered from lowest to highest, and the TER was assigned as a percentage rank (in steps of 0.05, ranging from 0.00 to 99.95) according to the student's position on that list. The process was the same for secondary students in the Northern Territory, except results were forwarded to SATAC by the Northern Territory Board of Studies. Calculation of the TER in Tasmania The TER was calculated by the Tasmanian Qualifications Authority for students who successfully completed the Tasmanian Certificate of Education (TCE) and fulfilled other criteria to qualify for a TER. The tertiary entrance aggregate was calculated as the sum of the best five Level 5 TCE subject scores, of which a maximum of two could be selected from Year 11. As in other TER systems, the aggregates were ranked in order and assigned a TER based on their position. Calculation of the TER in Western Australia The TER was calculated by the Tertiary Institutions Service Centre (TISC) for students who successfully completed the Western Australian Certificate of Education (WACE) and fulfilled other criteria to qualify for a TER. As the WACE qualification was being revised for from 2005 to 2009, the process for calculating the TER for WA students was changed for tertiary entry in 2009. In 2008, a Tertiary Entrance Aggregate (TEA) was calculated using the sum of the four highest Course of Study Levels of Achievement. As in other TER systems, the TEAs were ranked in order and assigned a ranking based on their position. Calculation of the TER in the Australian Capital Territory Calculation of the ACT TER is detailed in this 1992 ACT Board of Senior Secondary Studies information booklet https://digitised- collections.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/handle/11343/115855/scpp-00057-act-1992.pdf?sequence=1 See also * Equivalent National Tertiary Entrance Rank (ENTER) * Universities Admission Index (UAI) * Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) References * Category:Education in South Australia Category:Education in Tasmania Category:Education in Western Australia Category:Education in the Northern Territory Category:Universities in Australia Category:University and college admissions ","title":"Tertiary Entrance Rank"},{"id":"2517619","text":"Marguerite Frieda Harris (n√©e Bloxam, 1877, London, England ‚Äî 11 May 1962, Srinagar, India) was an artist and, in later life, an associate of the occultist Aleister Crowley. She is best known for her design of Crowley's Thoth tarot deck. Family Frieda Bloxam was a daughter of surgeon John Astley Bloxam, F.R.C.S. She married Percy Harris in April 1901. Percy Harris served as a Liberal Party MP 1916-1918 and 1922‚Äì1945, and was Chief Whip for his party. After her husband was created a baronet in 1932 she was entitled to style herself Lady Harris but preferred to use Lady Frieda Harris. Frieda and Percy Harris had two sons: Jack (born 1906, later Sir Jack Harris) and Thomas (born 1908). Introduction to Crowley Aleister Crowley had asked playwright and author Clifford Bax to help him find an artist for a Tarot project. On 9 June 1937 Bax invited Frieda Harris after two artists did not show up for an appointment. She was then aged 60. As well as reading books by Crowley, Harris' study of Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy was to be a critical aspect in the creation of the Thoth deck. Crowley's friend Greta Valentine, a London socialite, also knew Harris. Harris and Crowley did much of their work on the Thoth tarot deck at Valentine's house in Hyde Park Crescent, London. In 1937 Harris began taking lessons in projective synthetic geometry, based upon the ideas of Goethe as reflected in the teachings of Steiner, from Olive Whicher and George Adams. John Symonds writes: > [Crowley] helped her through the portals of the mystical Order of the A‚à¥A‚à¥ > (Argenteum Astrum) She took the name of Tzaba \\"Hosts\\", which adds up to 93, > the number of the Thelemic current which she was trying to tap.\\" According to Crowley's unpublished Society of Hidden Masters, on 11 May 1938, Lady Harris became his \\"disciple\\" and also became a member of Ordo Templi Orientis, entering directly to the IV¬∞ (Fourth Degree) of that Order due to her previous initiation into Co-Masonry. Crowley also began to teach her divination - she had a choice of discipline and opted for the I Ching: > \\"The Yi was your own choice from several. I approved highly, because it is > the key to the kind of painting after which you were groping when I met > you.\\" ... \\"If you are to make a new mark in art, you need a new mind, a mind > enlightened from the Supernal Triangle.\\"Letter from AC to FH, 17 December. > The date is 1936, but should be 1938 Harris visits Crowley The author William Holt in his autobiography describes how he accompanied Harris to Crowley's lodgings at 93 Jermyn Street, Piccadilly. While Harris drew some charcoal sketches, there was a discussion on The Book of Thoth that Crowley was writing. Creating the Tarot By Crowley's own admission, the deck was originally intended to be traditional but Harris encouraged him to commit his occult, magical, spiritual and scientific views to the project. Harris sent Crowley a regular stipend throughout the project. She also used her society contacts to find financial backers for the exhibition of the paintings, the catalogues, and for the publication of the Tarot deck. The pressure may have taken its toll on Harris and Crowley was sufficiently concerned to call in the lawyers to protect his 66% investment in the project. Crowley gives Harris praise in the introduction to the Book of Thoth: > She devoted her genius to the Work. With incredible rapidity she picked up > the rhythm, and with inexhaustible patience submitted to the correction of > the fanatical slave-driver that she had invoked, often painting the same > card as many as eight times until it measured up to his Vanadium Steel > yardstick! Throughout the project she insisted on her own anonymity but she revelled in working for such a notorious man. The Book of Thoth was published in 1944 in a 200 copy limited edition, but neither Crowley or Harris lived to see the deck itself printed. Crowley's last days The surviving letters between Frieda Harris and Crowley show the level of their devotion to each other. On 29 May 1942 Crowley wrote to Pearson, the photoengraver of the Thoth deck: > I should like to emphasise that I am absolutely devoted to Lady Harris, and > have the evidence of countless acts of kindness on her part, indicating that > her feelings toward me are similar. There is a break in the Harris - Crowley letters after the exhibition in July 1942 but she was in close contact with him, particularly towards the end of his life, and visited him frequently. A pencil sketch she made of Crowley on his deathbed survives. After Crowley's death she wrote to Frederic Mellinger, an O.T.O. member in Germany, on 7 December 1947: > He was well taken care of. I made him have a nurse about 3 months ago as he > was dirty & neglected & he had Watson who was most devoted & the Symonds > were as nice as they knew how to be. At the last Mrs. McAlpine & the boy > were there. I saw him the day he died, but he did not recognize me. I think > Mrs. McAlpine was with him but she says there was no struggle, just stopped > breathing I shall miss him terribly An irreplaceable loss Love is the law, > love under will Yours Sincerely Frieda Harris She also corresponded with Gerald Gardner and Karl Germer, Crowley's successor as head of O.T.O., in an attempt to assist with the Order's structure in Europe, which had been thrown into some confusion after Crowley's death. Frieda Harris and Louis Wilkinson were the executors of Crowley's Will. After Crowley Harris had plans to do a lecture tour in the United States and exhibit the original paintings of the Thoth tarot deck in 1948 but this never materialised. After her husband's death in 1952, she moved to India. She died in Srinagar on 11 May 1962. She bequeathed the original paintings of her Tarot cards to fellow Thelemite Gerald Yorke, who in turned placed them with the Warburg Institute along with much other Crowley material that he had collected over the years. However, Yorke retained several alternative versions of the cards and some preliminary studies which he later sold through bookdealer Harold Mortlake.

He was the Democratic nominee in 2006 for Governor of Connecticut, unsuccessfully challenging incumbent Republican Governor M. Jodi Rell. He was also the named defendant in the landmark 2009 U.S. Supreme Court case of Ricci v. DeStefano. John DeStefano is the son of a New Haven police officer. John and his wife Kathy DeStefano met at the University of Connecticut as undergraduates, where he also earned a Masters in Public Administration. Kathy DeStefano is a first grade teacher in West Haven, Connecticut, and they are the parents of two adult sons. Career A high-level aide under mayor Biagio DiLieto, DeStefano first ran for the mayor's office in 1989, after DiLieto announced he would not seek re-election. DeStefano won the endorsement of the New Haven Democratic Party, but was defeated in a Democratic primary by John Daniels. DeStefano successfully ran again in 1993. He served ten consecutive terms, (posting his tenth mayoral election victory in November 2011) during which his efforts included a massive overhaul of New Haven's public schools, based principally on the magnet school model, and New Haven's selection as a federal \\"Empowerment Zone\\". DeStefano was New Haven's longest-serving mayor; after 10 terms in office, he announced that he would not seek an 11th term. DeStefano was a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition,; retrieved June 19, 2007 an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston mayor Thomas Menino. He had to deal with public perceptions that violent crime was on the rise in New Haven. On August 8, 2006, John DeStefano defeated Mayor Dannel Malloy (D-Stamford) in the Connecticut Democratic Primary for Governor, becoming the Democratic Party's official candidate, with running Lieutenant Governor running mate Mary Messina Glassman. DeStefano and Glassman were defeated by the very popular Rell in the general election by one of the largest majorities in state history and conceded that night. Following his defeat by Rell, DeStefano focused his attention on a controversial plan to issue official city ID cards to city residents, including undocumented immigrants. Proponents called the cards a way for undocumented aliens to gain access to city services and bank accounts (reducing undocumented immigrants' potential to avoid bank fees and interest, while also providing that they don't have to hold large amounts of cash, which made them and people who looked to criminals like undocumented immigrants targets for theft), while critics considered the cards an encouragement to illegal immigration.\\"Residents can apply July 24 for Elm City ID\\" Mary E. O'Leary, New Haven Register. Proponents pointed out that the undocumented immigrants are already living in the city, and are the responsibility of the federal government, and that these cards would serve to bring people out of the shadows and under a small degree of government supervision. The city began issuing the cards on July 24, 2007.\\"City ID program draws protests, illegal immigrants\\" New Haven Register, July 25, 2007. DeStefano focused his tenure as mayor on improving education and public safety in New Haven, as well as on economic development. Notable initiatives included the Livable City Initiative, begun in 1996, which promoted homeownership and removed blight, and the Citywide Youth Initiative. In 1995, DeStefano launched a 15-year, $1.5 billion School Construction Program, already half finished, to replace or renovate every New Haven public school. DeStefano was President of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities and President of the National League of Cities. In 2008, DeStefano announced massive budget cuts to balance the city's $456 million budget, including the potential closures of an elementary school, police substations, and senior centers. In 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against DeStefano in the discrimination case of Ricci v. DeStefano. The city had been under a court order to promote 20 white and Hispanic firefighters who had been denied promotions on the basis that the civil service test they took had been biased. Justice Samuel Alito's concurring opinion suggested that DeStefano had been motivated by improper political considerations in denying the promotions. DeStefano currently teaches an undergraduate seminar, entitled \\"Making Public Choices in New Haven\\", at Yale University.

The dessert acquired its name when cakes and pies were cooked in the same pans, and the words were used interchangeably. In the latter part of the 19th century, this type of cake was variously called a \\"cream pie\\", a \\"chocolate cream pie\\", or a \\"custard cake\\". History Owners of the Parker House Hotel in Boston say that the Boston cream pie was first created at the hotel in 1881 by French chef Raelyn, who led the hotel's culinary staff from 1865 to 1881. A direct descendant of earlier cakes known as American pudding-cake pie and Washington pie, the dessert was referred to as chocolate cream pie, Parker House chocolate cream pie, and finally Boston cream pie on Parker House's menus. The cake consisted of two layers of French butter sponge cake filled with thick custard and brushed with a rum syrup; its side was coated with the same custard overlaid with toasted sliced almonds, and the top coated with chocolate fondant. While other custard cakes may have existed at that time, baking chocolate as a coating was a new process, making it unique and a popular choice on the menu. The name \\"chocolate cream pie\\" first appeared in the 1872 Methodist Almanac. An early printed use of the term \\"Boston cream pie\\" occurred in the Granite Iron Ware Cook Book, printed in 1878. The earliest known recipe for the modern variant was printed in Miss Parloa's Kitchen Companion in 1887 as \\"chocolate cream pie\\". Boston cream pie is the official dessert of Massachusetts, declared as such on December 12, 1996. Variations A Boston cream doughnut is a name for a Berliner filled with vanilla custard or cr√®me p√¢tissi√®re and topped with icing made from chocolate. This doughnut can be found at various restaurants including Dunkin' Donuts. The Taiwan version of the Boston cream pie is a chiffon cake which does not include chocolate and resembles Chinese baked goods more than the original Boston cream pie.

The common name is shared with closely related species T. fluminensis and T. pallida.Nelson Sutherland, C.H. (2008). Cat√°logo de las plantes vasculares de Honduras. Espermatofitas: 1-1576. SERNA/Guaymuras, Tegucigalpa, Honduras.CONABIO. 2009. Cat√°logo taxon√≥mico de especies de M√©xico. 1. In Capital Nat. M√©xico. CONABIO, M√©xico D.F.. Description The plant matting on the ground Tradescantia zebrina has attractive zebra-patterned leaves, the upper surface showing purple new growth and green older growth parallel to the central axis, as well as two broad silver-colored stripes on the outer edges, with the lower leaf surface presenting a deep uniform magenta. The leaves are bluish green and usually have two longitudinal stripes that are silvery on the surface and purple on the underside. The leaf sheaths are thin and translucent, 8 to 12 mm long and 5 to 8 mm wide, at the mouth they are long, otherwise glabrous or slightly hairy. The low-lying, slightly succulent, perennial, herbaceous plant often forms dense mats or colonies. This is done primarily by natural formation of sinkers. On the nodules of the shoot are root approaches, from which roots develop in permanent contact with water or a sufficiently moist substrate under favorable conditions within a day. The shoots are glabrous or hairy. The stalked, parallel-veined leaves are mostly ovate, 4 to 10 cm long and 1.5 to 3 cm wide, pointed towards the tip, rounded to the base. The upper surface is glabrous to mildly hairy, the underside hairless to averagely hairy, ciliate towards the leaf base. The structure of the flower - usually from the three pink petals and the white sexual organs - is similar to that of the other Tradescantia, but unlike what happens in those, the plant branches off thanks to new buds whose attachment starts below that of the leaf (and not above) The flowers are in groups, supported by two large foliage-like, narrow, ciliate bracts. The hermaphrodite, radial-symmetrical flowers are threefold. The three overgrown sepals are 2 to 3 mm long. The three only grown at the base petals are ovate-blunt, pink to purple and 5 to 9 mm long. The six equally sized stamens are violet hairy. Three carpels have become a top permanent ovary grown. They form capsule fruits that contain gray-brown seeds.Paul C. Standley and Julian A. Steyermark: Flora of Guatemala , Field Museum of History Botanical Series, Volume 24, Part III, Chicago, USA, 1952. Habitat Tradescantia zebrina is native to Mexico, Central America and Colombia, but can also be found from Belize to El Salvador and Panama, as well as on the Caribbean islands. It is naturalized in parts of Asia, Africa, Australia, South America, and various oceanic islands. The plant grows in thickets in the wetland and rainforest, often on stones in shady and open areas or on river banks at altitudes of 2000 meters or below, but mainly at lower altitudes.Fritz Encke: Plants for Room and Balcony , Eugen Ulmer, Stuttgart, 1964. Uses =Cultivation= A potted T. zebrina It is commonly available and used as a houseplant and groundcover, aggressively colonizing new areas when left undisturbed. Propagated by cuttings, this plant can be moved or manipulated easily as its runners cling lightly to the ground (if used as cover). It tends to become an invasive species if not properly maintained. The plant is not frost-resistant but can be kept indoors during the winter months in colder climates. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. =Medicinal= Skin irritation may result from repeated contact with or prolonged handling of the plant ‚Äî particularly from the clear, watery sap (a characteristic unique to T. zebrina as compared with the other aforementioned types). Invasiveness It is classified as a Category 1b Invasive Species in South Africa, and thus may no longer be planted or propagated. All trade in seeds, cuttings or other propagative material is prohibited. It may not be transported or be allowed to disperse, either in rural or urban areas. It is also an invasive species in the Galapagos Islands. Varieties # Tradescantia zebrina var. flocculosa (G.Br√ºckn.)

It is one of several plants known by the common name wandering Jew. It is also known as small-leaf spiderwort, river spiderwort, inch plant, wandering trad, wandering willie, wandering gypsy. Description Tradescantia fluminensis is a perennial ground cover that spreads along the ground with soft, hairless stems and leaves. The fleshy stems root at any node that is on the surface. The plant has oval, dark-green leaves with pointed tips that are shiny, smooth and slightly fleshy about long. The flowers are white with three petals and approx. in diameter. They are produced in small clusters in summer but do not produce seeds. Cultivation Tradescantia fluminensis is grown as a garden plant or houseplant in many places. Even in places where it is a pest it may be grown as a house plant in variegated forms. The plant requires a moist soil to do well but is retarded by cold climates, especially where there is frost or snow. It tolerates heavy shade. Because it requires moisture it grows weakly, if at all, in sunny areas that dry out for long periods. However, because it is a fleshy plant that retains water, it can withstand extended periods of dryness only to resume growth once better conditions return. Numerous cultivars are available with variegated leaves, of which 'Quicksilver' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Invasion as a pest Tradescantia fluminensis is considered an invasive species, noxious weed, or pest plant in many places and is consequently targeted for eradication. Seriously affected areas include Australia, New Zealand, and the southeastern United States. An extensive infestation of Tradescantia fluminensis, covering the forest floor at Chatswood West, Australia. It is classified as a Category 1b Invasive Species in South Africa, and thus in South Africa it may no longer be planted, propagated, or be allowed to disperse, and all trade in their seeds, cuttings or other propagative material is prohibited, in both rural and urban areas. The seriously invasive qualities of T. fluminensis result from a combination of attributes. Forming a dense mat underneath forest tree cover to 12 inches (30 centimeters) or even more (facilitated by a remarkable shade tolerance) it smothers ground-level plants and prevents the natural regeneration of taller species and if left unchecked, it can lead to the destruction of native forests. Even where the climate does not permit T. fluminensis to take root, it still can spread rapidly from being transported by animals and humans and even strong winds. The succulent stems break easily at the nodes and establish themselves wherever they land on moist soil. While T. fluminensis does respond to herbicides and other applied weed controls, each segment has the ability to regenerate, so it is able to make a rapid comeback, especially in soft soils where stems may remain underneath the surface. Eradication methods =Chemical control= The plant is resistant to chemical control as a result of its glossy leaves and smooth stems, along with its ability to regenerate from small surviving pieces. Nevertheless, for large infested areas this is probably the only means of achieving control. Unfortunately, any chemical that is capable of killing the plant is likely to kill most other plants and so a clear area will result for a period of time. However, since there are treatments that rapidly degrade upon soil contact within a day, this effect is limited to the time that it takes for seeds of other species to germinate and establish themselves. Because of the waxy surface of leaves and stems, a penetrant is needed for effective treatment. Successful treatments include the following: * triclopyr or fluoroxypyr (marketed under various brand names) plus a penetrant such as the organosilicone called modified polydimethylsiloxane (e.g. Pulse) flower Chemical treatment will result in browning off in 3‚Äì4 weeks followed by disappearance of living material. However, follow-up is needed several months later (in a frost free climate) to catch any buried plant segments that may have regenerated and possibly a third such spot treatment is required before the area is completely eradicated and even after that attention to a resurgence is advised. =Manual control= Repeated deployment of weed-control agents may have a negative effect upon the local environment, in which case the only option remaining is manual clearance. In areas where the plant is a pest this is an arduous task since every single scrap of the weed has to be removed or it will regrow. In less prolific areas, manual removal is less difficult as the plant roots come up easily, and an initial clearance can be accomplished by raking the area. Repeated efforts at intervals of a few months along with regular monitoring for invasion from neighbouring areas will be necessary for full control. =Combined chemical-manual control= In view of the persistence of the plant and the cost of chemical treatment plus the negative effect on other species, especially in regions where it is a pest, a combination of an initial chemical treatment followed by manual removal for the second or possibly third treatment is worth considering. Nevertheless, absolutely scrupulous attention to the removal of every single piece of the stems from both above and below the surface is required before elimination can be assured. =Small-scale control using livestock= There are anecdotal reports of using browsing animals (e.g. sheep) to control the plant. Heavy stocking is suggested to ensure all the infestation is consumed, and as with other methods, ongoing monitoring is required to ensure no scraps of plant material have survived to re-infest the area. For residential properties, chickens are an excellent method to control and remove Tradescantia fluminensis, as they will feed on all parts of the plant.

History South Perth, overlooking the Narrows Bridge Prior to European settlement and exploration Mount Eliza was known as Mooro Katta and Kaarta Gar-up, the Aboriginal names given by the Nyoongar inhabitants. The area has been an important ceremonial and cultural place for the Whadjuk tribe who had campsites and hunting grounds in the area.Erickson, Dorothy. 2009. A Joy Forever. Perth: Botanic Gardens and Park Authority In the 1880s Kings Park was used by the Perth section of the Volunteer Rifle Corps' (a civilian militia) for shooting. At the base of the southern face is a freshwater spring, known as Kennedy Spring (Goonininup), which provided year-round water for the native inhabitants. The spring was noted by the first European visitors to the area, Willem de Vlamingh's party, on . The Lieutenant Governor of the Swan River Colony, James Stirling, chose the townsite of Perth for this reason ‚Äì the only local spring. He named the area Mount Eliza for Mrs Ralph Darling. The Colony's first Surveyor General John Septimus Roe recognised the qualities of the area and tried to protect it, by identifying the land to be set aside for public purposes. By 1835 Roe's protection was overturned and the first shipment of five tonnes of jarrah was cut on Mount Eliza, becoming the colony's first export. Logging in the area continued until 1871 when Roe's successor Malcolm Fraser persuaded the then Governor Weld to set aside as public reserve. This was enlarged in by , and in the area of the reserve was further increased to by Sir John Forrest, the first president of the Board appointed under the Parks and Reserves Act 1895. The area of Kings Park today is , smaller than in . Officially opened on 10 August 1895, the park was originally called Perth Park and was renamed in 1901 to King's Parkthe apostrophe was later dropped. This was to mark the ascension to the British throne of King Edward VII and the visit to Perth of George, the Duke of Cornwall and Princess Mary. One of the major roads through the park, May Drive is named in the Princess's honour. Forrest planted the first tree, a Norfolk Island Pine (Araucaria heterophylla), and other trees were introduced to the site, Eucalyptus ficifolia and exotic species of Pinus; few of these were successful due to lack of irrigation. The Mount Eliza reservoir provided water to the local area, and still remains, but by arrangement of the lease was partly diverted for use in the park itself. This was largely allocated, after 1919, to the memorial Oaks and Planes lining May Drive. Their eventual failure led to their substitution with Bangalay, Eucalyptus botryoides, and Eucalyptus calophylla var. rosea. Since 1999, Kings Park has been administered by the Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority (BGPA), who also administer Bold Park, and does not come under any local government authority. The park's administration building contains all the administrative offices where visitors may book guided walking tours, get information, or reserve one of the facilities. Kings Park was featured in 2006 on the American reality TV show The Amazing Race 9 as well as in 2011 on the Australian franchise The Amazing Race Australia 1, where teams collected a clue from in front of the War Memorial. In early 2009, the south western area of the park was severely damaged by a fire, which has been suspected to have been deliberately lit. The Elizabeth Quay redevelopment plans include a cable car to Kings Park, although construction is not in scope for the initial phase.

Originally proposed by Mr Arthur Lovekin, owner of the Daily News, the idea was based on the Avenue of Honour in Ballarat, Victoria. Originally families were required to pay 10 shillings to cover the cost of the plantings; ex-servicemen provided the necessary labour to plant the trees. In 1920 Lovekin and board member Sir William Loton each donated 500 pounds to clear and plant Forrest Avenue with Sugar Gums. After Lovekin died the Kings Park board renamed Forrest Avenue to Lovekin Drive. Kings Park now has three tree-lined avenues set aside to honour service personnel who died in the two World Wars and other engagements: May Drive, Lovekin Drive and the most recent addition - Marri Walk. =Fraser Avenue= Fraser Avenue Precinct Originally planted with Red-flowering gums Corymbia ficifolia in 1898 to celebrate Queen Victoria's Jubilee, and added to in 1929 to celebrate the State Centenary ‚Äì the gums were affected by patch canker disease in the 1930s.From sign on Fraser Avenue Trees of Fraser Avenue ‚Äì 100 Years in the Making It was in 1938 that the Lemon Scented Gum trees Corymbia citriodora now line the avenue are to honour the dignitaries and members of the Western Australia Centenary organising Committee, who on 29 September 1929 planted the trees. =Bali Memorial= This memorial is dedicated to the 16 Western Australian victims, the injured and those who helped the survivors of the Bali bombings on 12 October 2002 in the resort town of Kuta on the Indonesian island of Bali, where 202 people were killed and 209 injured.

The player's snake is about to eat a golden apple. Rattler Race is a snake video game, created in 1991 by Christopher Lee Fraley. It is similar to the 1982 apple-eating game Snake Byte, but with the addition of enemy snakes. It was distributed with the Microsoft Entertainment Pack 2,About window of Rattler Race, Christopher Lee Frarley, 1991 which was included with early Microsoft Windows systems. The player takes on the role of a hungry snake, who must eat all the apples in each level, whilst avoiding the hazards.Help system of Rattler Race, Christopher Lee Frarley, 1991  Levels  There are 30 levels of increasing difficulty.\\"Rattlesnakes eat apples? I don't know....but this is a fun game\\" - Review at GameFAQs, Retro, 2001 The player can begin at any level by using the level selection window, which shows a simple preview of the layout. When the level is created, a timer is started and apples appear in random places. When all the apples are eaten, the player's snake exits through a hole to complete the level.\\"Not the baby's toy...\\" - Review at GameFAQs, Shady, 2002 Four factors affect the difficulty of each level. Enemy snakes make navigating around the level harder, because running into them will kill the player's snake. The player can select the number of enemy snakes, from zero to three. If an enemy snake reaches the open exit hole before the player, the hole closes and the level restarts. Walls will kill the snake, if it runs into them. Careful planning of routes (to avoid running into walls) is necessary at higher levels when the snake has grown in size. Bouncing balls are lethal if they hit the head of a snake. They will harmlessly bounce off the bodies of the snakes and walls of the levels. The player can select the number of balls that appear in the game, from zero to three. Timer freezes appear sporadically, which will temporarily pause the timer to allow the player to get more points.  Score  The score can be increased by completing levels and eating apples. The player can also gain points by trapping and killing an enemy snake, which is done by forcing the enemy snake into a dead end. The enemy snakes can reduce the players score by eating the apples. Gold apples will randomly appear, which are worth more points than regular apples. However, if an enemy snake eats a gold apple, the player loses more points. If the player has selected enemy snakes, balls or both to appear in the level, additional points are rewarded for some actions. If the timer is active, the player gets more points for eating apples and completing the level. The player begins with three lives. An extra life is given each time the player gets to a score ending in 50, such as 50, 250 or 550.  Difficulty level  The player can select a difficulty level from Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced to Expert. This determines the speed of the game and affects the numbers of points gained from certain actions.

He was previously a chairman of the American Museum of Natural History's Anthropology Division. Career Thomas was born and raised in California, and after initially wanting to major in pre-med, ended up receiving all of his degrees in anthropology (including a Ph.D. in 1971) from the University of California, Davis instead. He is one of the founding trustees for the National Museum of the American Indian at the Smithsonian Institution, was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1989, and received the Presidential Recognition Award from the Society for American Archaeology. During his 35-year tenure at the AMNH, Thomas has published dozens of books, ranging from technical site reports to widely used popular textbooks and has been involved in archaeological fieldwork throughout North America. His best known projects include excavations at the Gatecliff Rockshelter in Nevada, which is the deepest stratified rockshelter in North America; on St. Catherines Island in Georgia, where he discovered the site of the Franciscan mission Santa Catalina de Guale; and the Spanish mission south of Santa Fe, New Mexico. Thomas's academic research is varied, with concentrations on the human response to environmental change in the Great Basin, as well as the consequences of Spanish exploration and colonization of the South on indigenous people in the region. One of Thomas's main foci is the relationship between Native American and anthropological communities. He has written extensively about the lawsuit against the federal government that prevented the repatriation of the Kennewick Man remains and has worked to support positive relationships between the scientific and native communities in North America. He believes that if better working relationships had been established before and during the Kennewick case, both sides could have come to an agreement without taking it to the level of the federal courts. Thomas is a major supporter of Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) and is sympathetic to Native American rights. The NAGPRA is legislation passed in November 1990 recognizing that Native American people have a special stake in the history of this country, and that museums have acquired items that are inappropriate (human remains, grave goods, items of cultural patrimony), that tribes need to be notified by museums with these items in their collections, and that decisions have to be made by both sides about repatriation. The law also applies to new finds, so that there are rules that apply to federal/state/Indian lands where artifacts are found as well. Thomas is also known as an educator and proponent of public involvement in archaeology. In addition to the many textbooks that he has written or co- authored, he is also actively involved in public outreach through the AMNH, and has helped produce a children's television show, called DIGS, that introduces kids (and their parents) to the discipline of archaeology in an easy to understand, fun, ‚Äúhands-on‚Äù way. He has held several university positions and he has also made a major contribution to the field (and managed to start his own academic lineage) by acting as a mentor to one of the current top names in hunter-gatherer archaeology. Robert Kelly, who worked as a volunteer with Thomas at Gatecliff Rockshelter as a teenager, has published numerous books and articles, has been voted president of the Society for American Archaeology, is currently head of the Anthropology Department at the University of Wyoming, and has mentored dozens of students himself in a relatively short period of time.

The train was built by the Budd Company and was powered by a diesel engine produced by the Winton Engine Company. The train was named after the renowned author Mark Twain because it was scheduled to provide service from St. Louis, Missouri to Burlington, Iowa via Hannibal, Missouri, his hometown. The train's exterior structure used stainless steel, and had a \\"shovel nose\\" front. The locomotive, number 9903, was named Injun Joe. The three cars received other names of Mark Twain characters, Becky Thatcher, Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. The train was christened on October 25, 1935 in Hannibal by Nina Clemens Gabilowitsch (1910-1966), the granddaughter and ultimately last descendant of its namesake. The ceremony was broadcast coast to coast on CBS radio. Two days later, it entered revenue service. It was retired by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q;) and then was purchased by Frank Dashner of Glenwood, Iowa in June 1960. In June 1962, the train was acquired by Ernie Hayes for $6,500 and placed on exhibit at the Midwest Old Thresher Association grounds in Mount Pleasant, Iowa. In 1972, after many years of neglect, the train was sold to Alex Barkett of the Building Leasing Corporation, and moved to Kansas City. After Barkett died, title transferred to the Civic Plaza National Bank and in September 1987 the train was moved to the Mid America Car Corporation. In 1984, Dave Stimson, a player for the Kansas City Chiefs, purchased the equipment. In 1987, the train was sold to John C. Lowe, who, with two other individuals, formed the Mark Twain Corporation. Through 2007, the train was in unrestored condition and located in Minooka, Illinois. In August 2008, it was shown by Gateway Rail Services in nearby Madison, Illinois to a group from the 2008 St. Louis Railroad Prototype Modelers Meet. A 2011 report from a Burlington railfan says the train is still at Gateway. A Google Maps view of the facility shows the trainset's separate cars grounded inside the main gate area. A fifth \\"Zephyr\\" car (car 500), apparently the dinette- coach built for the Pioneer Zephyr, is also stored there. The train set is currently for sale. On July 27, 2020, TRAINS Magazine reported that Wisconsin Great Northern Railroad announced the purchase of the Mark Twain Zephyr and its plans for restoration to running condition.

Appointed as a member of the Indian Peace Commission in 1867 to reach peace with the Plains Indians, he advocated self-determination for native tribes. He proposed the federal government replace military jurisdiction over tribal matters with a form of civil law on reservations, applied by the tribes themselves. Early life and family Samuel Tappan, a native of Manchester, Massachusetts, near Boston was a member of the prominent New England Tappan family. It included clergymen, politicians, merchants, sea captains, cabinet-makers, inventors, poets, philanthropists, educators, and abolitionists. He was a first cousin once removed of the noted brothers Arthur Tappan (1786‚Äì1865) and Lewis Tappan (1788‚Äì1873) who were silk merchants in New York; they were known as philanthropists and abolitionists, as well as their eldest brother, Senator Benjamin Tappan (1773‚Äì1857) of Ohio, who mentored Edwin M. Stanton, later Secretary of War under Abraham Lincoln.\\"Tappan-Toppan genealogy: ancestors and descendants of Abraham Toppan of Newbury, Massachusetts, 1606-1672\\", D. Tappan, 1915 Sam Tappan received a common school education and then went to work in the cabinet-making trade in his native town, learning to make chairs from his father. He next worked in Boston at an uncle's clothing store. Abolitionist activity While in Boston, Tappan was disturbed by the fate of fugitive slaves who were caught pursuant to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and returned to servile labor. Tappan was encouraged in his abolitionism by family members and prominent men, who included Wendell Phillips, William Lloyd Garrison, Theodore Parker, and others. In May 1854, the capture of the slave Anthony Burns in Boston and forced return by US Marshals stirred a fierce reaction among Boston's abolitionists. Crowds lined the street to protest his being shipped back to slavery in the South. This event may have inspired Tappan to take personal action following passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. At the age of 23, Tappan was one of a group of 29 New England settlers who came to found what later became Lawrence, Kansas, in August 1854 as part of the New England Emigrant Aid Company's \\"pioneer party\\". They were trying to arrange for anti-slavery advocates to settle in Kansas before the vote on whether it should be free or a slave state. He staked a claim to land that abutted the claim of the homeopathic physician Dr. John Doy, formerly of Rochester, New York.http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~kansaspast/doykan.htm He was also a correspondent for Horace Greeley's New York Tribune and did some writing for the Boston Atlas and several other newspapers, reporting on the territory‚Äôs first difficulties with border raiders. As an active abolitionist, he covered the antislavery movement in the Kansas Territory, including reports dealing with the armed and sometimes deadly conflicts between the territory‚Äôs Pro-Slavery advocates and those aligned with the Free-State movement. Tappan was also actively involved in the Underground Railroad, moving slaves through Kansas to northern states. He also participated in 1855 in Jacob Branson's rescue during the short-lived Wakarusa War.S. F. (Samuel Forster), d. 1913&startsearchat;=0 Tappan became active in the volatile political activity in the territory. In 1855, accompanied by political activist Martin F. Conway, he traveled through southern and western Kansas, speaking in favor of the free-state movement. He also maintained close ties to both the Kansas-based and East Coast leadership of the New England Emigrant Aid Company and participated in helping to smuggle arms (nicknamed \\"Beecher's Bibles\\") and other assistance to Free-Soil settlers. Tappan was clerk of the Topeka constitutional convention, assistant clerk of the House of Representatives in 1856, and the following year performed the duties of Speaker of the Topeka House of Representatives. He was secretary of the Leavenworth constitutional convention in 1858, and acted as clerk of the Wyandotte convention in 1859. His first cousin, Lewis N. Tappan, also emigrated to Kansas in 1857, and was Secretary of the Senate under the Topeka Constitution. Lewis Tappan was one of the Fort Scott Treaty Commissioners. Both Lewis and Sam were among the 15 armed men who captured the box containing the altered election returns at Lecompton, the discovery of which resulted in the overthrow of the pro-slavery party in Kansas. In 1860, Tappan relocated as a \\"Pike's Peaker\\" to the settlement that became Denver, Colorado. This move was part of a business arrangement involving his cousin Lewis N. Tappan and the then relatively unknown Henry Villard, who had both preceded him to the gold fields by a year. Sam Tappan worked as a journalist for the Daily Herald and became involved in gold and other mineral exploration and township settlement. His cousins Lewis N. Tappan (1831‚Äì1880), George H. Tappan (1833‚Äì1865), joined later in 1865 by William H. Tappan (1821‚Äì1907), operated Tappan & Co, one of the first general stores serving Colorado miners, with branches in Denver, Colorado City, Golden, and Central City. Civil War =Enlistment= With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Tappan received a commission from Colorado's Territorial Governor William Gilpin to help raise a regiment of Union volunteer troops. Commissioned initially as a captain, his success in recruitment drives in the small Colorado mining towns of Black Hawk, Georgetown, Golden, and Central City resulted in his being promoted by Gilpin to Lieutenant Colonel of the newly formed First Colorado Volunteer Regiment, serving under Colonel John P. Slough, a lawyer from Cincinnati, Ohio. After helping train the regiment at Camp Weld near Denver, Tappan was placed in command of Fort Wise with a detachment of the regiment until news arrived of the invasion of New Mexico Territory by Confederates from Texas. =Service in New Mexico Territory= Tappan and his charges joined the hurried movement of the First Colorado Volunteers to reinforce Fort Union in New Mexico in early March 1862, and later saw action against the Confederate troops along the Santa Fe Trail in New Mexico. Tappan participated in the second day of the Battle of Glorieta Pass on March 28, 1862, at Pigeon's Ranch. Tappan was the effective field commander of the Federal forces during the main engagement that day, and was exposed to enemy fire while Colonel Slough directed the Federal activity from the rear.Report of Lieut. Col. Samuel F. Tappan, First Colorado Infantry, The War of the Rebellion, Vol. 1-53, (serial No. 1-111), Chapter XXI, page 536. Tappan's actions that day were eventually overshadowed by the later success of the one-third of Slough's command that bypassed the Confederate lines and attacked and destroyed the enemy wagon train and supplies in their rear near Johnson's Ranch. Commanded by Major John M. Chivington, a former Methodist minister, who had also commanded the advance Union force which tangled with and defeated an advance Confederate unit on March 27 at Apache Canyon, this Union detachment effectively ended the threat posed by the Confederate invaders by destroying their supplies and ammunition stores. When Slough resigned as colonel a few days after the victory at Glorieta Pass, Tappan was the ranking officer and acting colonel. Although later recognized by both Col. Edward R. S. Canby, Commander of the Department of New Mexico, and Col. Christopher \\"Kit\\" Carson of the First New Mexico Volunteers for his sound military abilities, Tappan voluntarily relinquished his seniority rights and joined in signing a petition from among the men of the First Colorado to elevate Chivington, the recent hero of the Glorieta battle, to colonel. Chivington's promotion to Colonel where he outranked Tappan would eventually produce friction between the two as Chivington viewed Tappan as a rival whom he sought to discredit.Carol Turner, Forgotten Heroes and Villains of Sand Creek, The History Press, 2010 Tappan participated in action at Peralta on April 15, 1862, as the Union troops pursued the retreating Confederate forces under Brig. Gen. Henry Hopkins Sibley southward back towards Texas. Tappan, with the rest of the First Colorado, remained in New Mexico billeted at Fort Craig, serving under Canby well into the summer of 1862. =Return to Colorado= After an act of perceived insubordination in 1863, Tappan was relegated by Chivington to the command of Fort Garland, a command in a remote part of southern Colorado near the traditional lands of the Ute and containing a large Hispanic population. During his command of Fort Garland, he was assigned by Governor John Evans and Colonel Chivington to hunt down the Espinosa brothers, brigands and murderers who killed 32 Colorado citizens in cold blood and engaged in rape, robbery and other destructive acts. A $2500 reward had been offered by Governor Evans for the capture either dead or alive of the Espinosas. Employing the services of noted mountain man, Indian scout and tracker Tom Tobin, Tappan assigned a group of troopers to accompany Tobin and track down the Espinosas. On the fourth day, Tobin tracked down the Espinosas and killed the two brothers, bringing their severed heads back to Tappan as proof of his success. When Tappan forwarded the trophies to Denver, Chivington used the opportunity to lambast Tappan for such \\"unchristian\\" behavior despite the common use at the time of such methods. Tappan also paid Tobin from his own pocket when Governor Evans failed to pay the full reward he was owed. Years later as a matter of personal honor, Tappan sponsored an effort to make restitution to an aged and penniless Tobin. In 1864, Tappan's father died in Massachusetts and, after numerous queries to Chivington, Tappan was finally granted his first leave of the war. He returned home to help comfort his mother and sisters and then traveled to Washington, D.C. where he had many connections in the military hierarchy. His cousin Elizabeth Tappan Tannatt's (sister of his Colorado cousins' Lewis, William and George Tappan) husband, Col. Thomas R. Tannatt commanded the First Massachusetts Heavy Artillery in the city's defenses and John P. Slough, his former Colonel in the First Colorado, had been appointed a Brigadier General and was the Military Governor of Alexandria and commander of the fortifications at Fort Ward near Alexandria, Virginia. Edward R. S. Canby had also been promoted to Brigadier General following the successful defense of New Mexico against the Confederate invasion and transferred to Washington, D.C., where he served as Assistant Adjutant General and military aide to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. Tappan met personally with General Ulysses S. Grant and received an invitation from Grant to visit his field command at City Point, Virginia, where he spent several weeks before returning to Colorado. Tappan returned to Colorado in November 1864 and was laid up at Fort Lyon, Colorado Territory with a broken foot incurred on the eve of his arrival. This was two days before elements of the First Colorado Cavalry, together with the 100 day soldiers of the Third Colorado Cavalry, under the command of Colonel Chivington, initiated an attack on a peaceful encampment of Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians at Sand Creek. The attack, involving 675 cavalry troopers, originated at daybreak on November 29, 1864, who departed from Fort Lyon at 8 pm on November 28 following an argument between Chivington and some of the officers at the fort who tried to dissuade Chivington from making the attack. There was a general understanding with the Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians encamped on Sand Creek that they were under the protection of the Federal troops at Fort Lyon pursuant to an agreement reached that Fall with the then Commander of the fort, Major Edward W. Wynkoop. It is not known if Tappan played any part in the discussions with Chivington at Fort Lyon on November 28 before the attack. The Federal troopers under Chivington's command attacked the Indian villages at first light and killed 150-200 Indians, two- thirds of whom were women and children. The Federal troops lost ten soldiers and had 38 wounded (of whom four later died while at Ft. Lyon), some of the casualties apparently arising from friendly fire and disorder among the cooperating units. Some of the victorious troopers mutilated the bodies of their Indian victims and returned to Denver where these grisly battle souvenirs were proudly and publicly displayed to the citizens of Denver. The action at Sand Creek was greeted by citizens of Denver as a justifiable military victory which helped to avenge the murders of Plains settlers such as the Hungate family. However it eventually began to be seen in the nation at- large as an unjustifiable massacre of peaceful Indians under Peace Chiefs such as Chief Black Kettle of the Southern Cheyenne Tribe.http://www.nps.gov/sand/historyculture/upload/blackkettlepanel.pdf Tappan was appointed to head the military commission that investigated Colonel Chivington for his role in the action at Sand Creek. After testifying to Tappan and his fellow Commissioners at the inquiry against Chivington held in Denver, Capt. Silas Soule, a fellow Kansas pioneer and abolitionist, was killed by Charles W. Squires, another of the Colorado volunteers, presumably for his testimony against Chivington.http://www.nps.gov/sand/historyculture/upload/Combined-Letters- with-Sign-2.pdf Lieutenant Joseph Cramer http://www.nps.gov/sand/historyculture/joseph-cramer-biography.htm and Major Wynkoop also testified against Chivington at the inquiry at which Tappan presided. The investigation produced a report that was shared with the Military command as well as the US Congress. Two separate Congressional investigations were also undertaken of the events at Sand Creek both of which excoriated Chivington's actions.http://www.nps.gov/sand/historyculture/john- chivington-biography.htm Chivington was never punished as he had been mustered out of the service in January 1865 prior to the initiation of the investigative military commission. Tappan was later brevetted to the rank of Colonel before he was mustered out of the army at the end of the Civil War. During his service in the First Colorado Cavalry, elements of the regiment also joined the New Mexico Volunteers in campaigns against various Plains tribes, including the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache. Native American rights activities Both as a military officer and a civilian, Tappan was involved in negotiations and treaties between Native Americans and the United States government. While serving at Fort Garland, Tappan commented on the enslavement of Navajos by both the Utes and Mexicans, and sought official support to try to end the practice. He acted as witness to the treaty executed on October 7, 1863 at Conejos between the Tabeguache band of Utes under Ouray and the US government represented by Colorado Territory's Governor Evans, New Mexico Territory's Indian Superintendent Dr. Michael Steck, Indian agents Simeon Whiteley and Lafayette Head, and President Lincoln's personal representative John G. Nicolay.https://chipeta.wordpress.com/tag/john-l-evans/ Tappan was later appointed by President Andrew Johnson in July 1867, pursuant to an act of the US Congress, to serve as a member of the Indian Peace Commission along with Generals William Tecumseh Sherman, William S. Harney, Alfred H. Terry, and C. C. Augur and several prominent civilians. The Commission negotiated with several tribes in the Plains during 1867-1868, as well as other native tribes in the Southwest. In Kansas, on October 21, 1867, the group negotiated the Medicine Lodge Treaty with the tribes of the Southern plain. He and Gen. Sherman were the two commission members who finalized the Treaty of Bosque Redondo that was signed on June 1, 1868 at Fort Sumner, New Mexico, that ended the Bosque Redondo reservation fiasco. Tappan met several times with President Johnson and General Grant during his service with the commission, as well as many members of Congress. During his service with the commission, Tappan also recruited the young and inexperienced Henry Morton Stanley, later the famed African explorer and author, first as a clerk to cover the commission's work and later recommended that he be hired as a correspondent to file dispatches with major newspapers. Through this work, Stanley came to the attention of James Gordon Bennett, Jr. of the New York Herald, who later sent him to Africa in search of Dr. David Livingstone. Tappan also developed a lifelong friendship with the pioneer, buffalo hunter, Indian agent, illustrator and prominent Colorado artist/designer John Dare Howland, who was a clerk for the commission and later designed the Civil War monument at the Colorado Capitol building. Tappan also vociferously protested the Washita Massacre in November 1868 of Chief Black Kettle's Southern Cheyennes while camped near Ft. Sill Oklahoma Territory by Lt. Col. George A. Custer's Seventh Cavalry troopers. Tappan was also a leading member of Peter Cooper's United States Indian Commission, founded in 1869. He promoted legislation in favor of the funding of annuities and economic assistance promised to the Indians by the federal Indian Peace Commission two years before. Tappan remained active in the cause of native rights throughout the 1870s, strongly supporting President Ulysses S. Grant's peace policy. He openly charged that the efforts of the peace policy to reach a final settlement with Plains and Southwest Indians were being undermined by congressional railroad and land speculation interests, and that these interests were ultimately responsible for such atrocities against the Indians as the 1871 massacre of Eskiminzin's Apache band at Camp Grant, Arizona. Marriage and later life Following the Medicine Lodge Treaty in October 1867 which he attended as a Commissioner, Tappan adopted an orphaned Cheyenne girl whom he renamed Minnie Tappan. He made arrangements for Minnie to move back East to Boston, where she was enrolled in public school to further her education. After Tappan married the leading spiritualist Cora L.V. (Scott) Hatch Daniels (later known as Cora L.V. Richmond 1840-1923) and moved to Washington, DC, Minnie joined their household and continued her studies in Washington. When Tappan and his wife moved a few years later to Titusville, Pennsylvania, as part of a business venture, he made arrangements with his friend General Oliver Otis Howard for Minnie to continue her education at the Preparatory Department of what is now Howard University. While studying there in 1873, she fell ill and died and was buried in a Boston, Massachusetts, cemetery. Tappan also lived for a time during the post-War period in New York City. Following his service with the Indian Peace Commission, Tappan worked for his former associate Henry Villard at the Oregon Steamship and Railway Company during the 1870s to help systematize and encourage emigration to Oregon. He traveled during this time to Alaska and also represented Oregon at the Centennial Exposition in 1876 in Philadelphia. He later lived in California for a time. Tappan was appointed during the Presidency of Chester A. Arthur to become the first superintendent of the United States Indian Industrial School in Genoa, Nebraska, in 1884-1885. The school was started to teach trades and educate Native Americans. Tappan served until removed by President Grover Cleveland. Tappan's marriage to Cora, who was a spiritualist medium, author, poet, abolitionist, and fellow Native American rights activist,The Cora L.V. Richmond Archives eventually ended in divorce and they had no children together. He lived in Washington, D.C. for the last years of his life and was buried after his death at Arlington National Cemetery.Arlington National Cemetery Notes External links *In Memoriam - photograph *Correspondence and other documents by and about Samuel R.

He succeeded his grandfather, Emperor Daozong, in 1101 and reigned until the fall of the Liao dynasty in 1125. Jurchen invasion During the reign of Emperor Tianzuo, the Jurchen tribes led by Aguda established the Jin dynasty in 1115. Aguda formed the Alliance Conducted at Sea with the Han Chinese-led Northern Song dynasty against the Liao dynasty, and began to establish authority over former Liao territory in Mongolia. Emperor Tianzuo, however, proved incompetent in dealing with the Jurchen threat, and in 1115 a coup was attempted by Liao generals to install his uncle Yel√º Chun to the throne but was thwarted. The Jurchens advanced from Manchuria in 1117, and captured the Liao supreme capital in 1120, then its central capital in 1122. Another coup was attempted in 1121 to install Emperor Tianzuo's son, the prince of Jin, on the throne, but was again thwarted. The prince was executed, and most of the coup participants defected to the Jurchens. In 1122, Emperor Tianzuo fled from the Liao southern capital (present-day Beijing) to the western regions. His uncle Yel√º Chun then formed the short-lived Northern Liao dynasty in the southern capital, but died soon afterwards, and the southern capital was conquered by the Jurchens at the end of 1122 or early 1123. End of the Liao dynasty After the end of the Northern Liao dynasty, a general Yel√º Dashi rejoined Emperor Tianzuo. In 1123, the Jurchens captured Emperor Tianzuo's palace at Qingzhong (south of present- day Hohhot), capturing members of his family. Emperor Tianzuo fled to Western Xia and sought refuge there. Later, Emperor Tianzuo expressed his intention to attack the Jurchens, but Yel√º Dashi withheld his support, considering it folly as the Jurchens were too strong. In 1124, Yel√º Dashi fled to the west with a band of his followers, and established the Western Liao dynasty. In 1125, Emperor Tianzuo was captured by the Jin dynasty, ending the Liao dynasty.Chinese History ‚Äì Liao Dynasty Death In 1156, in an act of humiliation, the Jin emperor who at the time was the Prince of Hailing ordered him and the former Emperor Qinzong of Song to compete in a match of polo. Emperor Qinzong was weak and frail, thus quickly fell off the horse. Yel√º Yanxi himself was more familiar to horse riding, tried to escape but was shot to death by Jurchen archers.

Boys, also known as GVB, is an American reality series aired on Noggin's teen programming block, The N. It was produced by Noggin LLC and Dancing Toad Productions, which had previously teamed up with Noggin to produce A Walk in Your Shoes. The show aired from August 8, 2003 to October 7, 2005. GVB pits teams of adolescent boys and girls against each other in physical competitions. The series had four seasons: GVB: Tampa, GVB: Hawaii, GVB: Montana, and GVB: Puerto Rico. The Games Before the games started, anyone between the ages of 16 and 18 are asked to audition. The show then shows the competitions as well as the debacles between the two teams, both internally and externally. The games consisted of physical competitions as well as acts of sabotage such as during baking contests. The purpose of the competitions is to attain a prize (it has varied from season to season, but in Puerto Rico it was $50,000 for the winning team and $1,000 worth of travel gear split between the winning team members). Each competition earns the winners of the competition a set number of points (ranging from 100 to over 500 in the final event) and the team that earns the most points wins. The first game was set in Tampa and had three girls and three boys on opposite teams. They stayed at a summer camp. The second game was set in Hawaii and also had three girls and three boys on opposite teams. However, Lauren Collins and Jake Epstein also make appearances. This season also introduced the teams staying at vacation houses. The third game during the span of 11 episodes was set in rural Montana and had expanded the competitors to non-celebrity teams of four girls and four boys on opposite teams. The contestants were expected to constantly talk about winning the game, by chanting the phrase \\"Fresh Money\\" with a specific accent. Also, in episode 8 Colleen Kirk and Jose Gonzalez appeared to get in a verbal dispute with the rest of the episodes focusing on the consequences of the dispute. This was part of the script as none of the contestants were disqualified. The fourth and final game during the span of 10 episodes was set in Puerto Rico and the format changed yet again. There were four girls and four boys but they were no longer opposite each other. Three girls and one boy were competing against one girl and three boys. This happened during the span of episodes 4, 5, and 6 where the contestants were told to vote one girl and one boy. It was revealed to be a gimmick when Paris Hoover and Ryder Darcy were \\"voted out\\" but then they returned but this time they switched teams.

Glauber was written, among other programs, by Pat Langley, Herbert A. Simon, G. Bradshaw and J. Zytkow to demonstrate how scientific discovery may be obtained by problem solving methods, in their book Scientific Discovery, Computational Explorations on the Creative Mind. Their programs simulate historical scientific discoveries based on the empirical evidence known at the time of discovery. Glauber was named after Johann Rudolph Glauber, a 17th-century alchemist whose work helped to develop acid- base theory. Glauber (the method) rediscovers the law of acid-alkali reactions producing salts, given the qualities of substances and observed facts, the result of mixing substances. From that knowledge Glauber discovers that substances that taste bitter react with substances tasting sour, producing substances tasting salty. In few words, the law: : Acid + Alkali --> Salt Glauber was designed by Pat Langley as part of his work on discovery heuristics in an attempt to have a computer automatically review a host of values and characteristics and make independent analyses from them. In the case of Glauber, the goal was to have an autonomous application that could estimate, even perfectly describe, the nature of a given chemical compound by comparing it to related substances. Langley formalized and compiled Glauber in 1983. The software were supplied with information about a variety of materials as they had been described by 17-18th century chemists, before most of modern chemical knowledge had been uncovered or invented. Qualitative descriptions like taste, rather than numerical data such as molecular weight, were programmed into the application. Chemical reactions that were known in that era and the distinction between reactants and products were also provided. From this knowledge, Glauber was to figure out which substances were acids, bases, and salts without any quantitative information. The system examined chemical substances and all of their most likely reactions and correlates the expected taste and related acidity or saltiness according to the rule that acids and bases produce salts. Glauber was a very successful advance in theoretical chemistry as performed by computer and it, along with similar systems developed by Herbert A. Simon including Stahl (which examines oxidation) and DALTON (which calculates atomic weight), helped form the groundwork of all current automated chemical analysis. The Glauber method =Information representation (data structures)= Glauber uses two predicates: Reacts and Has-Quality, represented in Lisp lists as follows: :(Reacts Inputs {reactant1 reactant2 ...} Outputs {product1 product2 ...}) :(Has-Quality Object {substance} quality {value}) For their experiment the authors used the following facts: :(Reacts Inputs {HCl NaOH} Outputs {NaCl}) :(Reacts Inputs {HCl KOH} Outputs {KCl}) :(Reacts Inputs {HNO3 NaOH} Outputs {NaNO3}) :(Reacts Inputs {HNO3 KOH} Outputs {KNO3 }) :(Has-Quality Object {HCl} Tastes {Sour}) :(Has-Quality Object {HNO3} Tastes {Sour }) :(Has-Quality Object {NaOH} Tastes {Bitter}) :(Has-Quality Object {KOH} Tastes {Bitter}) :(Has-Quality Object {NaCl} Tastes {Salty}) :(Has-Quality Object {NaNO3} Tastes {Salty}) :(Has-Quality Object {KCl} Tastes {Salty}) :(Has-Quality Object {KNO3} Tastes {Salty}) Discovering the following law and equivalence classes: :Salts: {KNO3, KCl, NaNO3, NaCl} :Acids: {HCl, HNO3} :Alkalis: {NaOH, KOH} :‚àÄ alkali ‚àÄ acid ‚àÉ salt (Reacts Inputs {acid, alkali} Outputs {salt}) :‚àÄ salt (Has-Quality Object {salt} Tastes {Salty}) :‚àÄ acid (Has-Quality Object {acid} Tastes {Sour}) :‚àÄ alkali (Has-Quality Object {alkali} Tastes {Bitter}) The modern notation with strings like: NaOH, HCl, etc., is used just as short substance names. Here they do not mean the chemical structure of the substances, which was not known at the time of the discovery; the program works with any name used in the 17th century like aqua regia, muriatic acid, etc. = Procedures = Glauber is based in two procedures: Form-Class and Determine-Quantifier. The procedure Form-Class generalize the Reacts predicates by replacing the substance names by variables ranging on equivalence classes determined by a quality whose value distinguishes the substances in each class. In the experiment designed by its authors, the substances are partitioned in three classes based in the value of the taste quality according on their value: acids (sour), alkalis (bitter) and salts (salty). Glauber main procedure : Input: Reacts and Has-Quality predicate sets : Output: On success returns a generalized version of the Reacts predicate whose variables range over the equivalence classes and a new Class predicate which is like Has-Quality having a name-class instead of substance name: (Has-Quality {class-name} quality {value}) # If there are no more substance names in the Reacts predicates then finish # process the Reacts predicates with the Form-Class procedure # process the result of the previous step with Determine-Quantifier # go to step 3 Form-Class : Input: the Reacts and Has-Quality predicate sets : Output: a new substances class, a new Has-Quality and a new Reacts predicate set # Count the number of occurrences of each quality {value} in the Has-Quality predicates # Select the quality value with the largest number of occurrences, which substances are in the Reacts predicates # Create a name for the class # Generate a new Has-Quality predicate set removing all the predicates in Has-Quality with the selected quality {value} and adding the predicate (Has-Quality {class-name} quality {value}) to the Class predicates where class-name is the name obtained in step 3 # Generate a new Reacts predicate set by replacing the name of the substance in the class formed in the step 2 by the name created in step 3 # Create a new class extension by associating the name generated on step 3 with the set of all substances on the class selected on step 2 Determine-Quantifier :Input: the Reacts, Has-Quality and Class (generated by Form-Class) predicate sets :Output: An intentional quantified class corresponding to the extensional class generated by Form-Class, a new Reacts predicate set extended with the appropriate quantifier of the last discovered class received from Form-Class # Universally quantify the rule to determine the class #:(Has-Quality {class- name} quality {value}) => (‚àÄ class-name (Has-Quality {class-name} quality {value})) # Generate Reacts predicates replacing each substance in the new class for its class-name in the Reacts predicates # if all the predicates generated in the previous step are contained in the original set #: then quantify universally #: else quantify existentially References Category:Chemistry software ","title":"Glauber"},{"id":"2517913","text":"Virtutech was founded in 1998 as a spin-off from the Swedish Institute of Computer Science (SICS), in Stockholm, Sweden.

The company's main product is Simics software, used by teams of software developers to simulate computer systems. This facilitates the development, testing, and debugging of embedded software that runs devices such as high-end servers, network hardware, aerospace/military vehicles, and automobiles. Virtutech markets products that allow embedded software developers to create virtual models of hardware using an ordinary desktop computer, run specified sets of tests, and walk the programs through each step of execution, both forwards and backwards.

Virtutech is a member of Power.org. As embedded systems become more complex, especially with the advent of multiprocessors, it has become increasingly difficult to develop and debug embedded software without the use of specialized tools. Virtutech's idea is to provide tools that allow developers to develop software faster than they would using hardware and traditional development methods. In particular, by modeling a complex hardware system using software running on an ordinary workstation computer, Virtutech claims to reduce the challenge of embedded software development.Dr. Dobbs Podcast - Peter S.

On the workshop's right boundary was the town‚Äôs Gestapo headquarters. On its left boundary were the Schutzpolizei. Across the road were the Ukrainian police. He spent part of his youth in Budapest. He was a soldier of Austro-Hungarian Army during the World War I. Following regaining independence by Poland in 1918, he joined the Polish army and took part in Polish-Soviet War in 1920, and 1939 Defensive War. Between the wars, he worked as a mechanician in Lesko. In 1923, he became footballer of local team Sanovia. After 1939 he was engaged in Polish resistance movement. In July 1942, Zwonarz was approached by a Jewish doctor, Nathan Wallach, whose wife Jafa was acquainted with Zwonarz, about taking their three-and-a-half-year-old daughter under his care. Zwonarz agreed to do so, and immediately found accommodation for the little girl with another non- Jew by the name of Jan Kakol. Soon after their daughter was moved, Dr. Wallach and his wife were transferred to the Zaslaw labour camp, as they were amongst the many Jews being liquidated from the Lesko ghetto. On December 16, 1942, Wallach's wife was amongst 400 women scheduled to be executed in the main square of the labour camp. The women were lined up and most machine-gunned to death. She was not hit and was able to lay motionless and literally \\"play dead\\" until it was safe for her to move. She found her husband and they escaped, unnoticed, from the camp. The following day, the Wallachs arrived back in Lesko and again asked Zwonarz for help. Zwonarz, who was aged 45 at the time, an engineer by profession, and father of five children, now resolved to help Dr. Wallach and his wife just as he had helped their daughter. Fearing that his wife and children may accidentally say something about the Wallachs to the surrounding authorities, Zwonarz decided to keep the existence of the Wallachs (and two other Jews that would soon join them) a secret from his wife and children. In order to do this, he set up an underground shelter (which its occupants would come to call ‚Äúthe tomb‚Äù) beneath his small workshop, located at the rear of his property. In this \\"tomb\\", which measured 5 feet by 3.5 feet and was about 3 feet deep (1.54x1.07x92m), the four Jews survived on nothing but water, potatoes, scraps from Zwonarz‚Äôs meals, and occasionally some barley for over two years. Zwonarz even went to the trouble of installing an electricity wire, connected to the main city circuit (so it would not show any extra kilowatts on his meter), to run some cooking appliances and a light-bulb in the pit. Noticing all his additional comings and goings, as well as missing food and cotton, Zwonarz's wife, Franciszka Zwonarz (n√©e Jod≈Çowska), concluded he was having an affair. Unfortunately for Zwonarz, he could not contradict any of what his wife had said for fear of incriminating himself, his family and the Jews he was sheltering. It was only in 1944, when the advancing Russian Army drew nearer to Lesko and he had to move the Jews into the cellar beneath his house after they were nearly killed in the pit by Russian shelling, that he was forced to tell his wife the truth. They stayed in the cellar for six weeks until the Russians had liberated the town. After the liberation of Lesko, and when the Jews had regained enough strength to leave, they left and excused themselves for not being able to pay him for his trouble and expenses. Zwonarz responded by giving them his last items of worth, a wristwatch and a $10 bill, saying: \\"Take this, it's all I have. You'll need it to start a new life.\\" In 1967, Zwonarz and his wife Franciszka Zwonarz were honoured with the medal Righteous Among the Nations. In 2006, Franciszka and J√≥zef Zwonarz were included in survivor Jafa Wallach memoirs Bitter Freedom. Memoirs of a Holocaust Survivor.

The Elymaeans were skilled archers and natives of Susa, which lay to the east of the territory of Elymais. Most of the people of the kingdom were probably descendants of the ancient Elamites, who once had control of that area in the past. The provinces of Elymais were Massabatice (later Masabadhan), Corbiane and Gabiane. Nothing is known of their language, even though Elamite was still used by the Achaemenid Empire 250 years before the kingdom of Elymais came into existence.G. Cameron Persepolis Treasury Tablets (1948), and R. Hallock, Persepolis Fortification Tablets (1969). See also Persepolis Fortification Archive.

Aramaic in its Historical and Linguistic Setting. Wiesbaden. P. 107-130 The kingdom of Elymais survived until its extinction by a Sasanian invasion in the early 3rd century AD. Coinage Coin of Kamnaskires III, king of the Elymais, and his wife Anzaze The coins of Elymais depicted a king; it is not known whether this was a Parthian king or a local ruler, as such information has not come to light. These coins were based on Greek standards of debased Drachms and Tetradrachms. The royal picture is generally based on Parthian coinage, usually with an anchor with a star in crescent figure. The reverse has a figure or bust of Artemis with text around it, an eagle, or often only elongated dots (this has led numismatists to believe that the engravers didn't know Greek or copied from coins whose writing was already unintelligible).Coins of Elymais A variant of Aramaic, which was more conservative than the contemporary Late Old Eastern Aramaic spoken in eastern Mesopotamia, has been recorded in Elymais until the rise of the Sasanians. The chancellery of Elymais developed its own variant the Aramaic alphabet, which was characterized by cursive letters and frequent use of ligatures, apparently influenced by the contemporary Parthian chancellery script. However, there is no evidence that Aramaic was a spoken language in Elymais. It is recorded only in coins (since Orodes III) and inscriptions, such as those of Tang-e Sarvak.

It was later republished by Wizard Books in 2004. It forms part of Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone's Fighting Fantasy series. It is the fourteenth in the series in the original Puffin series () and 19th in the modern Wizard series (). Rules As with titles such as House of Hell and Appointment with F.E.A.R., Temple of Terror utilizes an additional game mechanic: five letters have been scattered throughout the story, and if the player finds all five letters they spell the word DEATH and the player instantly dies, ending the game. Story Temple of Terror is a fantasy scenario. The reader plays as a wandering adventurer who is recruited by the good wizard Yaztromo (who previously appeared in The Forest of Doom) and tasked with locating the five dragon artefacts (bone, crystal, ebony, gold and silver) which are hidden in the lost city of Vatos. Gameplay takes the form of a campaign: the player must determine a means of traveling through the Desert of Skulls, find and scour Vatos for the amulets whilst overcoming various traps and monsters and finally defeat Malbordus. Successful completion of the quest requires the player from the first paragraphs to acquire items that will assist in future situations.

It is one of several parkways in Ottawa administered by the National Capital Commission providing scenic routes throughout Canada's capital region. Many luxury homes and several embassies line the street. The north end connects to the Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway and the Champlain Bridge, which crosses the Ottawa River into Gatineau, Quebec. Island Park Drive is named for Bate Island, the largest island crossed by the Champlain Bridge, which has a small park with road access. The south end connects to the Central Experimental Farm, where it becomes the NCC Driveway. Island Park Drive has a northbound offramp from the westbound Queensway and no other ramps. Hampton Park is north of the Queensway and borders Island Park Drive. Island Park residents often walk their dogs in the park. During the summer of 2007, the Highway 417 overpass was replaced using a rapid replacement technology technique which uses heavy lift and rolling equipment. This process lifted out the old bridges and replaced them with new bridges built nearby. The full operation, which required about 15 hours, occurred during the night of 11-12 August 2007, and it is the first time that this method was used in Canada, although it previously was used in other countries including the United States. It was the first of two similar operations in the 417 corridors, the other being at a future date near the Carling Avenue area. Commercial vehicles are prohibited from Island Park Drive, which is a two-lane arterial road with a 40 km/h (25 mph) speed limit due to the residential nature.

His attorneys asked for the trial to be delayed an additional two months and the trial was delayed to October 28 because the judge said the case was \\"so unusual and complex\\". Carona pleaded not guilty to all charges and claimed he would be vindicated at the trial. The trial relied prominently on the testimony of Donald Haidl, a former partner of Carona.

Oelwein (February 10, 1838 - December 19, 1913) was the founder of the city of Oelwein, Iowa in the United States. Gustav A. Oelwein, after whose family the city of Oelwein was named, was a native of Baltimore, Maryland, and the only surviving child of Frederick and Cecelia (Schmidt) Oelwein, who were natives of Saxony, Germany, and emigrated to America in 1837, settling in Baltimore. Mr. Oelwein was born on February 10, 1838, and in 1848 moved with his parents to Dubuque County, Iowa, and later, in 1855, the family moved to Jefferson township, Fayette County. He attended the schools of Baltimore and Dubuque, and after moving to Fayette County, he gave his attention to agricultural pursuits, which business he followed for many years. In 1857 the land on which the city of Oelwein now stands was purchased, and in 1868 he purchased a tract of land about two miles south of the present city and erected a flour and feed mill, which he operated for some time. In 1872 the Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Northern Railroad survey came through, and the town was started in 1873. Mr. Oelwein donating the site, the town was given his name. On February 23, 1861, Mr. Oelwein led to the marriage altar Emma Schmidt, daughter of Frederick and Maria Schmidt, who was born in Saxony, Germany, on March 24, 1836. She attended the schools in her native country and in 1855 came with her parents to America, where they located on a farm in Jefferson township, Fayette County.

Bedgreave Mill ‚Äì looking south towards the courtyard. The Rother Valley Country Park is a country park in the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, close to Rotherham's border with Sheffield and Derbyshire. It covers 3 square kilometres (740 acres), has four artificial lakes, recreational activities and nature reserves. The majority of the park is on land that was open cast for coal, with the main excavation sites filled by the artificial lakes. Description The park was officially opened on 27 May 1983, at a cost of ¬£4 million. It aimed to provide an area for recreational pursuits, encourage wildlife to return to the area, and provide a flood protection plan for the areas downstream. When the construction was finished, the lakes were filled with fresh water from The Moss (about away) because the River Rother was so heavily polluted at that time. The park was formerly a mixture of meadows and marshy bullrush beds before the open cast excavation started. At the eastern side of the lake stands the Bedgrave Mill courtyard, where the visitor centre is located displaying the flood defence map and the original mill mechanism \\"flour into grain\\" exhibition from when it was a water mill, also there is a craft centre and \\"The Stables\\" cafe there. Cable waterskiing and narrow-gauge railway Rother Valley Country Park is home to Sheffield Cable Waterski and Aqua Park. The cable waterski system was installed when the park was originally opened to the public and it was one of the few cable waterski systems in the UK at the time. In recent years an Aqua Park (inflatable obstacle course) has been also been added. The popularity of cable waterskiing has grown significantly since this time and there are now a number of these systems in the UK, mainly focused on offering kneeboarding and wakeboarding facilities and what is now called a Wake Park, which is a collection of obstacles (kickers, sliders, etc.) floating in the lake that riders will \\"hit\\" on their way round and do tricks from. It is very similar to a snowboard or skateboard park. There is also a licensed waterfront bar and a caf√© at Sheffield Cable Waterski. An long narrow-gauge railway was opened on the east side of the main lake in 2009. \\"Gulliver's Valley\\" In February 2017, planning permission was granted for a new resort to be built alongside Rother Valley called \\"Gulliver's Valley\\". It will be operated by Gullivers theme parks, which operates Gulliver's Kingdom in Matlock Bath, Gulliver's Land in Milton Keynes and Gullivers World in Warrington. The theme park will be aimed at families, and the resort will also include a water-park and accommodation in the form of glamping. Once building commences it is hoped that phase one should be open in 2020, which includes the main theme park. The site is set to be built in different phases throughout a ten‚Äìfifteen year project.

It is commonly referred to as the \\"Kumano Taisha\\", although the shrine does not officially have a \\"Taisha\\" designation. The shrine is one of the three main centers of the Kumano cult within Shintoism. History The origins of the shrine are uncertain. The shrine claims to have been founded in 806 AD by Emperor Heizei as a branch of the famous Kumano Sanzan shrines in Kii Province,and the shrine was associated with the provincial temple of Dewa Province. However, an alternative history states that the shrine was built in the late Heian period by Taira no Koremori by order of Emperor Go-Shirakawa. In either case, the shrine was patronized by the successive feudal lords of the region, including the Date clan, Mogami clan and Uesugi clan. After the Meiji restoration and the creation of State Shinto, the shrine was ranked as a Prefectural Shrine. Two main features of the shrine are a giant tree which locals believe to be several hundred years old, and a traditional bell. The bell is unique because during World War II, most large iron bells in Japan were melted down for their material. The bell at the shrine was saved by order of the Emperor, and is thus one of the few original preserved bells in Japan. The Kumano-Taisha festival is held at the shrine each year on July 25.

The term derives from the peace imposed on Carthage by Rome. After the Second Punic War, Carthage lost all its colonies, was forced to demilitarize and pay a constant tribute to Rome and could enter war only with Rome's permission. At the end of the Third Punic War, the Romans systematically burned Carthage to the ground and enslaved its population. Origin The term refers to the outcome of a series of wars between Rome and the Phoenician city of Carthage, known as the Punic Wars. The two empires fought three separate wars against each other, beginning in 264 BC and ending in 146 BC. At the end of the Third Punic War, the Romans laid siege to Carthage. When they took the city, they killed most of the inhabitants, sold the rest into slavery, and destroyed the entire city. There is no ancient evidence for modern accounts that the Romans sowed the ground with salt. By extension, a Carthaginian peace can refer to any brutal peace treaty demanding total subjugation of the defeated side. Modern use Modern use of the term is often extended to any peace settlement in which the peace terms are overly harsh and designed to accentuate and perpetuate the inferiority of the loser. Thus, after World War I, many (the economist John Maynard Keynes among them)Keynes, John Maynard. The Economic Consequences of the Peace. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Howe, 1920. described the Treaty of Versailles as a \\"Carthaginian Peace.\\" The Morgenthau Plan put forward after World War II has also been described as a Carthaginian peace, as it advocated the deindustrialization of Germany. It was intended to severely curb the influence of German power in the region and to prevent its remilitarization, as had occurred after World War I (Remilitarization of the Rhineland). The Morgenthau Plan was dropped in favor of the Marshall Plan (1948‚Äì1952), which entailed the rebuilding of Western European infrastructure, particularly in West Germany. General Lucius D. Clay, a deputy to general Dwight D. Eisenhower and, in 1945, Military Governor of the U.S. Occupation Zone in Germany, would later remark that \\"there was no doubt that JCS 1067 contemplated the Carthaginian peace which dominated our operations in Germany during the early months of occupation. This is while the US was following the Morgenthau Plan.\\"A Nation at War in an Era of Strategic Change, p.129 (Google Books) Clay would later replace Eisenhower as governor and as commander-in-chief in Europe. The Marshall Plan was favored as a revival of the West German economy was considered to be necessary for the recovery of the economy of Europe. West Germany was regarded as a key bulwark against the Eastern Bloc.

It is a designated World Heritage Site, added in 1979 with Stari Ras. The monastery is located 15 km west of the town of Novi Pazar. History Detail of the fresco Dormition of the Mother of God from Sopoƒáani c. 1265 (See also:Palaiologian Renaissance) In the 1160s, the Great Zupan Stefan Nemanja consolidated his power on the throne in Raska.By Their Fruit you will recognize them - Christianization of Serbia in Middle Ages, Perica Speher, 2010. Although Nemanja's sons got the title of king and established the church as independent by making it autocephalous, developed the economic system and coined money, became richer and more sophisticated, the times, the work and person of Stefan Nemanja remained a great model and an example to be emulated by the younger generations. Sopoƒáani was an endowment of the Serbian King Stefan Uro≈° I, son to Stefan the First- Crowned and Nemanja's grandson. It was built in 1260 by King Uro≈° I Nemanjiƒá as a church which would serve as his burial place, and was extended and renovated in the mid-14th century by his great-grandson Du≈°an. The church is dedicated to the Holy Trinity. Of the former larger monastery complex, which comprised numerous structures (dining rooms, residential buildings and others), today only the Church of the Holy Trinity remains. The monastery was once surrounded by a high stone wall with two gates. The completion of the painting of the main parts of the church can be indirectly dated to between 1263 and 1270. In Sopocani a decorative plan was carried out which was formed throughout the thirteenth century - in the chancel there are liturgical scenes, in the nave Christ's salvation work is shown through a cycle of the Great Feasts, in the narthex the Old Testament, dogmatic and eschatological themes are presented. Through the iconographic portraits of the Nemanjic family and through historical scenes Simeon Nemanja and Saint Sava. After Gradac (about 1275), the endowment of Queen Helen of Anjou, the wife of the founder of Sopocani - King Uros I - whose painters were high on the scale of creativity, there was a hiatus in creative artwork in Serbia. Archbishop Sava II, who became the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1263, is represented in the procession of archbishops in the area of the altar. The frescoes of Sopoƒáani are considered by some experts on Serbian medieval art as the most beautiful of that period. On the western wall of the nave is a famous fresco of the Dormition of the Virgin. In the 16th century the monks had to temporarily leave the monastery on several occasions due to the Ottoman threat. Finally, during one of the raids in 1689 the Ottoman Turks set fire to the monastery and carried off the lead from the church roof. The brotherhood escaped with some important relics to Kosovo - but did not return to Sopoƒáani; it remained deserted for over two hundred years, until the 20th century. The church slowly decayed: its vaults caved in, its dome fell down, and the remains of the surrounding buildings were covered with rubble and earth. Finally, during the 20th century the monastery was restored and today it is settled by a thriving brotherhood of dedicated monks. The fact that most of the Sopoƒáani frescoes still shine with radiant beauty - surviving more than two centuries of extreme exposure to the elements. Sopoƒáani was declared Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia. Art history and influence The art in Sopoƒáani was implemented periodically through the years following its completion in 1260. The subjects of the art include Christian Saints, national saints, as well as episcopal and illuminative narratives of Christianity. These narratives follow a left-to-right order of narration, needing to be viewed in a specific order to be understood. The classical art style of the church is largely influenced by late Byzantine art, such as that of the Basilica of San Vitale and other Byzantine churches. Some of the frescoes in the church exemplify a transition of Byzantine art periods, from Komnenian to Palaiologan, as many paintings were completed between 1263-1268. The Dormition, with its stately compositions and monumental figures, is an example of this. The period following iconoclasm brought upon a resurgence in these art styles moving forward into the 13th century, at the time of the construction of the monastery. Other motifs seen in the church (such as water-birds and use of specific lotuses) are indicative of influences from early Byzantine art dating to the era of Justinian I, although these influences are less prominently featured in the church. The implementation of this art can be separated into several distinct periods. In 1263-1268, various paintings, including those of the sons of Stefan Uro≈° I, Dragutin, and Milutin, were created. In 1331-1346, during the reign of King Stefan Du≈°an, the church expanded and took on characteristics of a cathedral, expanding the art and decorations seen in the exo-narthex of the church. In 1335-1371, it is presumed that the fresco paintings of the church were completed, evidenced by painting styles seen in other nearby churches. In 1370-1375, the first example of repainting was evidenced in the church, and the copying of Sopoƒáani works created the Sopoƒáani style which spread and influenced other church paintings. And in the early 20th century, the art of Sopoƒáani served as an inspiration for modern Serbian artists. =Art reconstruction= In 1689, various factors contributed to widespread damage through the church. War with the Ottoman Turks led to the desecration of the monastery. In addition, inclement weather and prolonged sun exposure led to damage of much of the art. There were two periods in the early 20th century (1925-1929, and 1949-1958) in which reconstruction campaigns began on a large scale. Notably, the color and clarity of the paintings were restored, but much of the gold-leaf outlines remain difficult to discern in the frescoes of the church. Notable art and techniques =Paintings= The frescoes in Sopoƒáani were painted in a similar style to that of Byzantine artists, however the origins of the artists themselves remain unknown. There was a rigid set of steps (setting of plaster, designing with charcoal, application of opsis in various layers, etc.) that were usually followed by these artists. However, there were exceptions to this method, as is the case with the Dormition, which was painted over visible division lines that are usually erased. Some historians believe this to be the result of an oversight on the part of the artist. The Dormition is another example of a late Komnenian fresco, characterized by its use of a rambling narrative linear style. Some of the more prominent frescoes in the church had gold-sheet tesserae applied in their outlines, a decision that was made by Stefan Uro≈° I to provide a greater sense of visual grandeur. =Iconography= A demand was created for portable icons due to Byzantine influence and the introduction of iconostasis in churches. The icons in Sopoƒáani largely represent a matriarchal ideology, depicting the life and death of the Virgin Mary, among others. The portraits of these icons incorporated techniques and symbolism from Byzantine, and earlier Roman style, which emphasizes the positioning of the head, as well as male and female qualities of the hands. For instance, the left hand would often be considered female, holding books or scriptures. The right hand would be considered male, holding a sword, a cross, or a spear. These qualities can be seen in icon plates of the martyrs, saints, apostle, and evangelist in Sopoƒáani. The portrayal of figures in these icons are also concurrent with the development of naturalism in painting, found in other Byzantine icons and mosaics such as the Deisis in Hagia Sophia.

History  The Oxford English Dictionary has illustrative quotations which show the term season ticket used in the United States in 1820 for theatre tickets; and in the United Kingdom in 1836 for boat travel and 1862 for rail transport.  Sports  In sports, such as association football or American football, a season ticket grants the holder access to all regular-season home games for one season without additional charges. The ticket usually offers a discounted price over purchasing a ticket for each of the home games for a season individually. In some sports, season ticket holders are usually allowed to buy tickets for other home games (such the playoffs) earlier than other fans, and may be given priority when buying tickets for their team's allocation at a away game. Seats assigned to season tickets are generally the better ones in their seating section. Season ticket holders are frequently offered preferred seating at special events or extra games. Season passes are commonly used for winter sports, but were originally in American ski resorts a privilege for club members and investors. However, in 2000 a discounting movement across the US triggered a price war and increased the widespread use of season passes.Skiing Heritage Journal Dec 2010 - Page 36 Vol. 22, No. 4 - Magazine IN THE BEGINNING The origins of the season pass ... \\"DISCOUNT PASSES TODAY When the year 2000 dawned, there was a new dynamic in season passes‚Äîa discounting movement that triggered a price war and brought the season pass to the masses.\\"  Arts  A season ticket is also an option for many music venues (including Opera, Ballet, Symphony houses) and repertory theatre companies. The season subscription usually offers a discounted price over purchasing a ticket for each concert or play in a series or all concerts or plays in a season.  Public transport  In public transport, a season ticket allows the user to travel by public transport an unlimited number of times within a period of time. The term \\"commuter pass\\" is used in some countries. Season tickets are typically sold for a week, month or year. The validity of season tickets varies. At one extreme it may only allow travel between two points (A to B) by only one operator and one route (if there are more than one competing). At the other extreme, it may allow unlimited travel within a geographic area, or even a whole country, allowing free choice of method of transportation (bus, tram, train, etc.) and free choice of operating company.  Television  In television, a season ticket refers to the term invented by the manufacturers of the TiVo digital video recorder for the function which allows a user to program the device to record all the episodes of a season of a television show, even if their airings are rescheduled or pre-empted. Similar functions are available on competitive digital video recorder systems and software packages, such as ReplayTV and IceTV. With the advent of digital streaming services, such as Netflix and digital video stores like iTunes and Google Play Store, one can also purchase a season pass to gain the ability to watch every episode of a chosen season at one's leisure on a computer or mobile device.  Other uses  Other examples of venues that often offer season passes include amusement parks, recreational sports venues (ski areas), and paid-admission parks (state and national parks). Some passes may also grant additional perks, such as free or prepaid parking, or coupons exclusive to pass-holders.

When the ship‚Äôs master refused, flag state consent was sought, and given, for the ship to be interdicted and diverted to Singapore for the port search. A team from the Republic of Singapore Navy‚Äôs Naval Diving Unit (NDU) was the first to board the vessel. After the ship was secured by the NDU team, follow-on forces from the Singapore Armed Forces Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosive Defence Group, the Japan Coast Guard and Australian Customs Service boarded the vessel and conducted a preliminary search and investigation. Following indications of a suspicious cargo on board, the ship was escorted to Singapore‚Äôs port for a detailed search by domestic enforcement agencies. Port Search Phase From Aug 15-19 2005 joint government and military teams searched cargo container in Singapore's Pasir Panjang Scanning Station for weapons of mass destruction.

Point of Ayre lighthouse, the oldest lighthouse on the Isle of Man, is located here. It is the closest point on the Isle of Man to the British mainland, being south of Burrow Head in Scotland. The name Ayre comes from the Norse word Eyrr meaning gravel bank. Strong currents offshore cause an ever-changing build-up of shingle, so that the beach changes shape with each tide. A tidal range at the Point of Ayre provides excellent fishing from the beach. Visitors are attracted by the gorse and heather which surrounds the lighthouse and merges with sand dunes stretching to the south-west, providing cover for rare wild flowers and forming part of a Manx National Heritage Nature Reserve.

The episcopate of Pope Mark IV (ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿßÿ®ÿß ŸÖÿ±ŸÇÿ≥ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿßÿ®ÿπ) lasted for 14 years, 4 months and 26 days from 5 September 1348 AD (8 Thout 1064 AM) to 31 January 1363 AD (8 Amsheer 1079 AM). He departed this world on 31 January 1363 AD after a great struggle, perseverance, and patience. Upon his death, he was buried in the monastery of Shahran (ÿØŸäÿ± ÿ¥Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜ). The See of St Mark remained vacant for 3 months and 6 days after his death.

Finally, a monk (and also a priest) by the name of Gabriel (ÿ£ÿ®ŸàŸÜÿß ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿßŸáÿ® ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ≥ ÿ∫ÿ®ÿ±ŸäÿßŸÑ) from the Monastery of Shahran (ÿØŸäÿ± ÿ¥Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜ) was chosen as patriarch under the name Pope Mark IV of Alexandria. It was the monastery where his predecessor, Pope Peter V, used to be its priest before his elevation to the episcopal seat in 1340 AD. At the time of his elevation to the episcopal seat, Priest Gabriel was assigned to serve at the Church of the Holy Virgin Mary and St Damiana, known as the Hanging Church in Coptic Cairo (ŸÉŸÜŸäÿ≥ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿ∞ÿ±ÿßÿ° ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπÿ±ŸàŸÅÿ© ÿ®ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπŸÑŸÇÿ©). Priest Gabriel was also one of those who attended the consecration of the Holy Oil of Chrismation (Miron) in 1342 AD at the time of his predecessor, Pope Peter V (Episcopate 1340 - 1348 AD). His name at birth was Farag-Allah (ŸÅÿ±ÿ¨ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá). He was from the city of Qaliub, in the Nile delta, just to the north of Cairo. He was a monk at the monastery of Shahran (ÿØŸäÿ± ÿ¥Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜ) who then became a priest at the same monastery and then was assigned to serve at the Church of the Holy Virgin Mary and St Damiana, known as the Hanging Church in Coptic Cairo (ŸÉŸÜŸäÿ≥ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿ∞ÿ±ÿßÿ° ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπÿ±ŸàŸÅÿ© ÿ®ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπŸÑŸÇÿ©). Finally, he became the 84th Patriarch on 5 September 1348 AD. The entire period from the seventh century to the nineteenth century was a period of continual persecution of the Egyptian Church at the hands of various Muslim rulers. This would be punctured with short periods of peace in which the persecution would temporarily drop in intensity. A persecution arose in the later days of Al-Sultan Hassan Al-Nasser [Sultan Nasser Hassan Ben Mohamed (first time, 1347-1351 AD) - ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÑÿ∑ÿßŸÜ ÿ≠ÿ≥ŸÜ]. The Spaniards had requested the reopening of the Melkite churches (which were closed at the time) and requested the release of a Spanish prisoner. After the Sultan had agreed to the requests, he came back and demanded a large ransom for the prisoner, and Spain rejected the request. A dispute arose. Somehow, the Copts bore the afflictions of this dispute, and a persecution ensued. This persecution was cut short by the death of Al-Sultan Hassan Al-Nasser in 1351 AD. He was succeeded by his son the second good and did not carry the attributes of his name anything. It was strange that, amid this, the persecution was clear. They arrested a Coptic man who came from the countryside to Cairo. He called on his brothers to keep faith, and rebuked the men and tortured him for a week. Then they cut off his head and burned his body on the road. The non-Copts have suffered from plague and Copts have suffered persecution and plague. When Al- Sultan Al-Saleh II [Sultan Salah Eddin Saleh Ben Mohamed - (1351-1354 AD) - ÿßŸÑÿµÿßŸÑÿ≠ ÿ≠ÿ≥ŸÜ ÿ®ŸÜ ŸÜÿßÿµÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßÿµÿ±] took over the throne in 1351 AD (1068 AM, 752 AH), matters took a turn for the worse. Matters were further complicated when the Plague struck Egypt in impunity in 1353 AD (1069 AM, 754 AH). The plague ruined most of the Egyptian villages. In 1354 AD (1071 AM, towards the beginning of the year 755 AH), the Muslims raised detailed reports of the Christian property that belonged to the Coptic monasteries. These reports were transmitted to the Diwan of Ahbash (ÿØŸäŸàÿßŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ≠ÿ®ÿßÿ¥). Prince Shikho, Prince Sarghatmesh, and Prince Taz were presented with these reports. They were in charge of the government in 1054 AD. They decided that these properties belonging to the Coptic monasteries should be handed over to various princes to supplement their grants. The property of the Church and the monasteries that were confiscated were 25,000 feddans (Hectares). After a great struggle, perseverance, and patience, Pope Mark IV departed on 31 January 1363 AD.

The report identified a range of significant issues: :Ordinary banks in our country have frequently conducted their business badly. There has been excessive competition among too many small banks with slender means; bankers have been ignorant of the need for reserves to back deposit withdrawals and generally ill-informed about the working of deposit banking; there has been over enthusiastic lending of bank resources in either particular or long-term outlets against securities of real estates in favour of related businesses; there has been serious negligence in establishing a thorough audit system both inside and outside the banks. The need to address the problems identified in this proposal generally acknowledged. The report was the genesis of a process which led to the Bank Act of 1927.Tamaki, In March 1929, Y≈´ki left for a tour of Europe.

History Sowers was settled in the late 1840s and by 1884 had a population of seventy-five and possessed several businesses including a blacksmith, a church, a doctor, a druggist, a school, and two steam gristmill- cotton gins. A post office was established in 1881, it and the town were named after early pioneer E. D. Sowers. The population was listed at 121 residents in 1905 and remained at or near that figure until the 1950s, when the community's last reported population was a mere thirty residents in 1956.

Since Barrow had not had a gift to present his mother, the pair planned to return the following evening for an extended visit at which time he planned to give her a gift. On November 22, 1933, as Parker and Barrow approached the previous evening's family meeting spot, law enforcement officers Smoot Schmidt, Ted Hinton, Ed Caster, and Bob Alcorn; armed with Thompson submachine guns, .351 \\"Bullhead\\" repeating rifle, and BAR (Browning Automatic Rifles) opened a fusillade of gunfire from a ditch about seventy-five feet away. Upon their accelerated escape, several .30 caliber rounds from Bob Alcorn's BAR pierced the driver side door of Clyde's stolen 1933 Ford V-8 five-window coupe wounding both Parker and Barrow with shots to the knees. The pair subsequently abandoned the car and fled. Hinton and Alcorn later participated in the fatal ambush that halted Barrow and Parker's spree on May 23, 1934 near Gibsland, Louisiana.

The symbol rate is measured in baud (Bd) or symbols per second. In the case of a line code, the symbol rate is the pulse rate in pulses per second. Each symbol can represent or convey one or several bits of data. The symbol rate is related to the gross bitrate expressed in bits per second. Symbols A symbol may be described as either a pulse in digital baseband transmission or a tone in passband transmission using modems. A symbol is a waveform, a state or a significant condition of the communication channel that persists, for a fixed period of time. A sending device places symbols on the channel at a fixed and known symbol rate, and the receiving device has the job of detecting the sequence of symbols in order to reconstruct the transmitted data. There may be a direct correspondence between a symbol and a small unit of data. For example, each symbol may encode one or several binary digits or 'bits'. The data may also be represented by the transitions between symbols, or even by a sequence of many symbols. The symbol duration time, also known as unit interval, can be directly measured as the time between transitions by looking into an eye diagram of an oscilloscope. The symbol duration time Ts can be calculated as: :T_s = {1 \\\\over f_s} where fs is the symbol rate. For example, a baud rate of 1 kBd = 1,000 Bd is synonymous to a symbol rate of 1,000 symbols per second. In case of a modem, this corresponds to 1,000 tones per second, and in case of a line code, this corresponds to 1,000 pulses per second. The symbol duration time is 1/1,000 second = 1 millisecond. =Relationship to gross bitrate= The term baud rate has sometimes incorrectly been used to mean bit rate, since these rates are the same in old modems as well as in the simplest digital communication links using only one bit per symbol, such that binary \\"0\\" is represented by one symbol, and binary \\"1\\" by another symbol. In more advanced modems and data transmission techniques, a symbol may have more than two states, so it may represent more than one binary digit (a binary digit always represents one of exactly two states). For this reason, the baud rate value will often be lower than the gross bit rate. Example of use and misuse of \\"baud rate\\": It is correct to write \\"the baud rate of my COM port is 9,600\\" if we mean that the bit rate is 9,600 bit/s, since there is one bit per symbol in this case. It is not correct to write \\"the baud rate of Ethernet is 100 megabaud\\" or \\"the baud rate of my modem is 56,000\\" if we mean bit rate. See below for more details on these techniques. The difference between baud (or signaling rate) and the data rate (or bit rate) is like a man using a single semaphore flag who can move his arm to a new position once each second, so his signaling rate (baud) is one symbol per second. The flag can be held in one of eight distinct positions: Straight up, 45¬∞ left, 90¬∞ left, 135¬∞ left, straight down (which is the rest state, where he is sending no signal), 135¬∞ right, 90¬∞ right, and 45¬∞ right. Each signal (symbol) carries three bits of information. It takes three binary digits to encode eight states. The data rate is three bits per second. In the Navy, more than one flag pattern and arm can be used at once, so the combinations of these produce many symbols, each conveying several bits, a higher data rate. If N bits are conveyed per symbol, and the gross bit rate is R, inclusive of channel coding overhead, the symbol rate can be calculated as: :f_s = {R \\\\over N} In that case M = 2N different symbols are used. In a modem, these may be sinewave tones with unique combinations of amplitude, phase and/or frequency. For example, in a 64QAM modem, M = 64. In a line code, these may be M different voltage levels. By taking information per pulse N in bit/pulse to be the base-2-logarithm of the number of distinct messages M that could be sent, Hartley constructed a measure of the gross bitrate R as: :R = f_s \\\\log_2(M) where fs is the baud rate in symbols/second or pulses/second. (See Hartley's law). =Modems for passband transmission= Modulation is used in passband filtered channels such as telephone lines, radio channels and other frequency division multiplex (FDM) channels. In a digital modulation method provided by a modem, each symbol is typically a sine wave tone with a certain frequency, amplitude and phase. Symbol rate, baud rate, is the number of transmitted tones per second. One symbol can carry one or several bits of information. In voiceband modems for the telephone network, it is common for one symbol to carry up to 7 bits. Conveying more than one bit per symbol or bit per pulse has advantages. It reduces the time required to send a given quantity of data over a limited bandwidth. A high spectral efficiency in (bit/s)/Hz can be achieved; i.e., a high bit rate in bit/s although the bandwidth in hertz may be low. The maximum baud rate for a passband for common modulation methods such as QAM, PSK and OFDM is approximately equal to the passband bandwidth.Goldsmith A. Wireless communications. ‚Äì Stanford University, 2004. - p. 140, 326 Voiceband modem examples: *A V.22bis modem transmits 2400 bit/s using 1200 Bd (1200 symbol/s), where each quadrature amplitude modulation symbol carries two bits of information. The modem can generate M=22=4 different symbols. It requires a bandwidth of 1200 Hz (equal to the baud rate). The carrier frequency is 1800 Hz, meaning that the lower cut off frequency is 1,800 ‚àí 1,200/2 = 1,200 Hz, and the upper cutoff frequency is 1,800 + 1,200/2 = 2,400 Hz. *A V.34 modem may transmit symbols at a baud rate of 3,420 Bd, and each symbol can carry up to ten bits, resulting in a gross bit rate of 3420 √ó 10 = 34,200 bit/s. However, the modem is said to operate at a net bit rate of 33,800 bit/s, excluding physical layer overhead. =Line codes for baseband transmission = In case of a baseband channel such as a telegraph line, a serial cable or a Local Area Network twisted pair cable, data is transferred using line codes; i.e., pulses rather than sinewave tones. In this case, the baud rate is synonymous to the pulse rate in pulses/second. The maximum baud rate or pulse rate for a base band channel is called the Nyquist rate, and is double the bandwidth (double the cut-off frequency). The simplest digital communication links (such as individual wires on a motherboard or the RS-232 serial port/COM port) typically have a symbol rate equal to the gross bit rate. Common communication links such as 10 Mbit/s Ethernet (10Base-T), USB, and FireWire typically have a symbol rate slightly lower than the data bit rate, due to the overhead of extra non-data symbols used for self-synchronizing code and error detection. J. M. Emile Baudot (1845‚Äì1903) worked out a five-bit code for telegraphs which was standardized internationally and is commonly called Baudot code. More than two voltage levels are used in advanced techniques such as FDDI and 100/1,000 Mbit/s Ethernet LANs, and others, to achieve high data rates. 1,000 Mbit/s Ethernet LAN cables use four wire pairs in full duplex (250 Mbit/s per pair in both directions simultaneously), and many bits per symbol to encode their data payloads. =Digital television and OFDM example= In digital television transmission the symbol rate calculation is: :symbol rate in symbols per second = (Data rate in bits per second √ó 204) / (188 √ó bits per symbol) The 204 is the number of bytes in a packet including the 16 trailing Reed-Solomon error checking and correction bytes. The 188 is the number of data bytes (187 bytes) plus the leading packet sync byte (0x47). The bits per symbol is the (modulation's power of 2) √ó (Forward Error Correction). So for example, in 64-QAM modulation 64 = 26 so the bits per symbol is 6. The Forward Error Correction (FEC) is usually expressed as a fraction; i.e., 1/2, 3/4, etc. In the case of 3/4 FEC, for every 3 bits of data, you are sending out 4 bits, one of which is for error correction. Example: : given bit rate = 18096263 :: Modulation type = 64-QAM :: FEC = 3/4 then :\\\\text{symbol rate} = \\\\cfrac{18096263}{6\\\\cdot\\\\frac{3}{4}} ~ \\\\cfrac{204}{188} = \\\\cfrac{18096263}{6} ~ \\\\cfrac{4}{3} ~ \\\\cfrac{204}{188} = 4363638 In digital terrestrial television (DVB-T, DVB-H and similar techniques) OFDM modulation is used; i.e., multi- carrier modulation. The above symbol rate should then be divided by the number of OFDM sub-carriers in view to achieve the OFDM symbol rate. See the OFDM system comparison table for further numerical details. =Relationship to chip rate= Some communication links (such as GPS transmissions, CDMA cell phones, and other spread spectrum links) have a symbol rate much higher than the data rate (they transmit many symbols called chips per data bit). Representing one bit by a chip sequence of many symbols overcomes co-channel interference from other transmitters sharing the same frequency channel, including radio jamming, and is common in military radio and cell phones. Despite the fact that using more bandwidth to carry the same bit rate gives low channel spectral efficiency in (bit/s)/Hz, it allows many simultaneous users, which results in high system spectral efficiency in (bit/s)/Hz per unit of area. In these systems, the symbol rate of the physically transmitted high-frequency signal rate is called chip rate, which also is the pulse rate of the equivalent base band signal. However, in spread spectrum systems, the term symbol may also be used at a higher layer and refer to one information bit, or a block of information bits that are modulated using for example conventional QAM modulation, before the CDMA spreading code is applied. Using the latter definition, the symbol rate is equal to or lower than the bit rate. =Relationship to bit error rate= The disadvantage of conveying many bits per symbol is that the receiver has to distinguish many signal levels or symbols from each other, which may be difficult and cause bit errors in case of a poor phone line that suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio. In that case, a modem or network adapter may automatically choose a slower and more robust modulation scheme or line code, using fewer bits per symbol, in view to reduce the bit error rate. An optimal symbol set design takes into account channel bandwidth, desired information rate, noise characteristics of the channel and the receiver, and receiver and decoder complexity.  Modulation  Many data transmission systems operate by the modulation of a carrier signal. For example, in frequency-shift keying (FSK), the frequency of a tone is varied among a small, fixed set of possible values. In a synchronous data transmission system, the tone can only be changed from one frequency to another at regular and well-defined intervals. The presence of one particular frequency during one of these intervals constitutes a symbol. (The concept of symbols does not apply to asynchronous data transmission systems.) In a modulated system, the term modulation rate may be used synonymously with symbol rate. = Binary modulation = If the carrier signal has only two states, then only one bit of data (i.e., a 0 or 1) can be transmitted in each symbol. The bit rate is in this case equal to the symbol rate. For example, a binary FSK system would allow the carrier to have one of two frequencies, one representing a 0 and the other a 1. A more practical scheme is differential binary phase-shift keying, in which the carrier remains at the same frequency, but can be in one of two phases. During each symbol, the phase either remains the same, encoding a 0, or jumps by 180¬∞, encoding a 1. Again, only one bit of data (i.e., a 0 or 1) is transmitted by each symbol. This is an example of data being encoded in the transitions between symbols (the change in phase), rather than the symbols themselves (the actual phase). (The reason for this in phase-shift keying is that it is impractical to know the reference phase of the transmitter.) = N-ary modulation, N greater than 2 = By increasing the number of states that the carrier signal can take, the number of bits encoded in each symbol can be greater than one. The bit rate can then be greater than the symbol rate. For example, a differential phase-shift keying system might allow four possible jumps in phase between symbols. Then two bits could be encoded at each symbol interval, achieving a data rate of double the symbol rate. In a more complex scheme such as 16-QAM, four bits of data are transmitted in each symbol, resulting in a bit rate of four times the symbol rate. = Not power of 2 = Although it is common to choose the number of symbols to be a power of 2 and send an integer number of bits per baud, this is not required. Line codes such as bipolar encoding and MLT-3 use three carrier states to encode one bit per baud while maintaining DC balance. The 4B3T line code uses three 3-ary modulated bits to transmit four data bits, a rate of 1.3 bits per baud. = Data rate versus error rate = Modulating a carrier increases the frequency range, or bandwidth, it occupies. Transmission channels are generally limited in the bandwidth they can carry. The bandwidth depends on the symbol (modulation) rate (not directly on the bit rate). As the bit rate is the product of the symbol rate and the number of bits encoded in each symbol, it is clearly advantageous to increase the latter if the former is fixed. However, for each additional bit encoded in a symbol, the constellation of symbols (the number of states of the carrier) doubles in size. This makes the states less distinct from one another which in turn makes it more difficult for the receiver to detect the symbol correctly in the presence of disturbances on the channel. The history of modems is the attempt at increasing the bit rate over a fixed bandwidth (and therefore a fixed maximum symbol rate), leading to increasing bits per symbol. For example, the V.29 specifies 4 bits per symbol, at a symbol rate of 2,400 baud, giving an effective bit rate of 9,600 bits per second. The history of spread spectrum goes in the opposite direction, leading to fewer and fewer data bits per symbol in order to spread the bandwidth. In the case of GPS, we have a data rate of 50 bit/s and a symbol rate of 1.023 Mchips/s. If each chip is considered a symbol, each symbol contains far less than one bit (50 bit/s / 1,023 ksymbols/s ‚âà 0.000,05 bits/symbol). The complete collection of M possible symbols over a particular channel is called a M-ary modulation scheme. Most modulation schemes transmit some integer number of bits per symbol b, requiring the complete collection to contain M = 2b different symbols. Most popular modulation schemes can be described by showing each point on a constellation diagram, although a few modulation schemes (such as MFSK, DTMF, pulse-position modulation, spread spectrum modulation) require a different description. Significant condition In telecommunication, concerning the modulation of a carrier, a significant condition is one of the signal's parameters chosen to represent information. A significant condition could be an electric current (voltage, or power level), an optical power level, a phase value, or a particular frequency or wavelength. The duration of a significant condition is the time interval between successive significant instants. A change from one significant condition to another is called a signal transition. Information can be transmitted either during the given time interval, or encoded as the presence or absence of a change in the received signal. Significant conditions are recognized by an appropriate device called a receiver, demodulator, or decoder. The decoder translates the actual signal received into its intended logical value such as a binary digit (0 or 1), an alphabetic character, a mark, or a space. Each significant instant is determined when the appropriate device assumes a condition or state usable for performing a specific function, such as recording, processing, or gating.

It opened on 6 March 1963 as the Monaro Mall,Canberra District Historical Society page about Territory places including Civic becoming the first in Australia to contain three floors and be fully enclosed, though would later expand to cover a substantial outdoor component on Garema Place. It was designated an Australian Capital Historic Site in 1997. It underwent a $220 million redevelopment and became the Canberra Centre in 1989. It was the first shopping centre in Canberra to have a car park operated by Car Park Ticket Machines. Canberra Centre is currently 207,668 m¬≤ in size with over 380 speciality retailers, encompassing an ownership merge with the ACT Government. History Prime Minister Robert Menzies opened the original shopping centre, known as the Monaro Mall, on 6 March 1963. At the time it was the first Australian three-storey, fully enclosed and air conditioned shopping centre. with David Jones, Marcus Clarks, Coles New World Supermarket (now closed), McEwans Hardware (now closed) and 58 speciality shops. The centre was expanded and rebranded as Canberra Centre and was opened officially by Rosemary Follet on 2 November 1989. Canberra Centre originally consisted of 4 city blocks: David Jones, Myer, City Market (a fresh food precinct) and Target. To access either City Market or Target, you had to either exit the main atrium and cross Bunda Street or access via the now- demolished travelators that ran parallel to Ainslie Avenue from the car parks. At this time, Canberra Centre was owned and managed by Canberra Advance Bank, which later became St George Bank. In 1992 Queensland Investment Corporation expressed interest in purchasing Canberra Centre and put in a 50% stake purchase of the centre. In 1993 the old Bunda Street entrance was aligned diagonally to be on the corner of Petrie Plaza and Bunda Street. Another extension occurred in 1993 of the Upper Floor fashion atrium, where Pumpkin Patch is now (pumpkin patch is no longer there in Canberra Centre). It was not until 2002 when a major expansion occurred, by extending the atrium by crossing over Bunda Street and closing Ainslie Avenue to allow access to City Market and Target without going outdoors. By this time, the original atrium was under refurbishment. The columns were painted in shades of white and dark green, replacing the previous watery-blue and maroon. Balustrades were re- fitted with stainless steel and painted black, replacing the brass and maroon. The Lower Ground Floor replaced all the brass and maroon chairs and tables, with plastic black and white ones. The Centre Court fountain was removed and replaced with a 360 TV. The centre clock, which ran up 3 levels, was removed due to being maroon and brass. All the toilets were refurbished and centre signage was replaced, again due to being brass letters on maroon wood. Further expansions were completed in late 2006, this time closing half of the City Market Car Park and City Market for retail space. The new mall added another 100 stores, a second food court and relocated City Market (now called the Fresh Food Precinct). On the northern end of Bunda Street, Canberra Centre's new dining and entertainment precinct, North Quarter houses restaurants on street level and indoor. On 28 February 2007, a severe thunderstorm known as a \\"supercell\\" passed over Canberra causing flash flooding, severe hail and property damage. The Canberra Centre along with the Australian National University and Campbell High School sustained heavy damage with flooding and damage to internal fit out. Severe damage was inflicted on most parts of the centre including the brand new expansion. The first sign of trouble for those inside the centre came when water began pouring from the ceiling of the Dendy Cinema. After ten minutes, staff began a hasty evacuation. Borders (now closed) also sustained heavy damage and flooding. In mid - 2013 the lower ground level food court was closed due to its refurbishment that will finish late - 2013. The David Jones lower ground level closed as well. Myer lower ground level continued to open. On Thursday 31 October 2013 the new Refurbished Lower Level Food Court was opened so as the Myer and David Jones lower ground. In July 2017, a renovated section of the Canberra Centre known as Monaro Mall reopened as the Beauty precinct with brands like Jurlique, Lush, Crabtree and Evelyn, Mecca Maxima, Inglot, L'occitane, Aveda . New fashion brands H&M;, Gorman, and Calvin Klein were also opened in 2017. End of 2018 and 2019 saw new brands like Superdry, Nike, Nothface, Vans, Levi's open stores on the lower level on the mall.

Founded in 1835 by Fr. Philip Dowley CM, it is one of the oldest boys schools in Ireland. Although priority is given to those of the main Catholic tradition, as a Christian school, it is attended by students of other denominations and faiths. The school's colours are navy and sky blue. The school crest is a book, symbolising education, a cross, symbolising the success of Catholicism and the Irish shamrock, symbolising the success of the Vincentians in Ireland. The school has a conservative, intellectual, and Vincentian ethos. History In 1830, a year after the passing of Catholic Emancipation, priests from the Vincentian Community (Congregation of the Mission; CM) in Maynooth College obtained permission to open a day school under the patronage of the Archbishop of Dublin. On 28 August 1833 a day school at 24 Usher's Quay, in central Dublin, was opened. On 28 August 1835, St. Vincent's Ecclesiastical Seminary was opened in Castleknock, as a boarding school catering for just 47 boys. The first student to enrol in 1835 was John Lynch of Clones, County Monaghan. He would later enter the Vincentian order and eventually become Archbishop of Toronto. A contemporary of John Lynch was Patrick Moran, who would also be ordained as a Vincentian priest and become Bishop of Cape Town before being appointed as the first Catholic Bishop of Dunedin (New Zealand) in 1869. Fr. Philip Dowley a former Dean of Maynooth and Provincial for the Vincentians, was the first President of the College. The school site had previously been occupied by a (Protestant) school for boys run by the Reverend Dr William Gwynne. The school buildings together with 40 acres of land were sold to the Vincentian Fathers in 1835.William John Fitzpatrick, Memories of Father Healy of Little Bray, Macmillan, 1895, page 14 Queen Victoria and her royal party visited the school on 22 April 1900. The event is historic, as being the first occasion that an English sovereign visited an Irish Catholic college. The intended visit of the Queen to Castleknock was made known to the authorities of the school some days beforehand by the Earl of Denbigh. This royal visit confirmed a place for the school at the summit of Irish education and Irish society. Before the foundation of Clonliffe College in 1861, seminarians for the Dublin Archdiocese would study in Castleknock before completing their studies in Maynooth College.Secondary Schools ‚Äì St. Vincents Castleknock Dubin www.vincentians.ie Ethos The school's motto is Nos Autem In Nomine Domini (\\"We, however, in the name of the Lord\\"), which comes from Psalms xx 7. The text in the psalm is \\"Hi in curribus et hi en equis; nos autem in nomine Domini Dei nostri invocabimus\\" (\\"Some trust in chariots or horses; we, however, [trust] in the Name of the Lord.\\") Each year, on Union Day, the College Medal (Vincentian Medal) is awarded to the Sixth Year student who has best embodied and exemplified the ethos and charisma of the College.

The school's Alton Library, a reference and lending facility, is the largest second-level school library in Ireland. =BT Young Scientist Exhibition= Students participate in the annual BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition; over the years many have received awards and commendations for their projects. In January 2011 Alexander Amini, a student in Fourth Year, won the BT Young Scientist and Technologist of the Year 2011 award for his project entitled Tennis Sensor Data Analysis. Amini was chosen to represent Ireland at the 23rd European Union Contest for Young Scientists in Helsinki, Finland in September 2011, where he also claimed the top prize against 38 countries. Sporting tradition Sporting facilities at the school include nine rugby pitches, one soccer pitch, a cricket crease with pavilion, table tennis room, state of the art tennis courts, a fully equipped weights room and an athletics track. Sport has been played at Castleknock since the foundation of the college. Throughout the mid-nineteenth century a game peculiar to Castleknock, known as Stilts, was played by the entire student body on a gravel patch in grounds. Owing to the often over-zealous efforts of the participants this game was discouraged by the College Fathers in favour of soccer, which was the game of choice among students of Castleknock until 1909 when it was replaced by rugby as the College's primary sport. In 1918 the College won the Leinster Colleges Senior hurling championship. Shortly afterwards the playing of Gaelic games was prohibited in the College and this ban has remained in place ever since. =Rugby= Rugby posts were first erected in the College in November 1909. The school has won the Leinster Schools Senior Cup on eight occasions since first entering (and winning) the competition in 1913. Castleknock teams have been runners-up in the competition on fifteen occasions, contesting more finals than any other school apart from Belvedere College and Blackrock College. The Leinster Schools Junior Cup has also been won on eight occasions, the last time in 1966. Castleknock is considered to be one of the Major Leinster Rugby Schools. The others being Blackrock, Clongowes, Belvedere, Terenure, St Michael's and St Mary's. The college appointed Adrian Flavin, a former Ireland rugby player, as director of rugby in the year 2013. Twenty six past men have represented Ireland at full international level, the most recent being Leinster Rugby's Devin Toner (Class of 2004) who has been capped on three occasions. Toner is one of two past men to have won the Heineken Cup (2009, 2011, 2012) with Denis Hurley of Munster Rugby lifting the trophy in 2008. Past men James Leo Farrell and Michael Dunne were part of the British and Irish Lions touring squad to New Zealand and Australia. Farrell had also played for the Lions on the 1927 tour to Argentina. =Athletics= Students can choose from sprints, relays, long- distance, hurdles, high jump, long jump, triple jump, javelin, shot-put, hammer, discus, pole vault and walking.

Recently, the college has established a volleyball team which competes at both junior and senior level in the Leinster division. Music Beginning in 2011, the music department within the school began to grow as a result of the interest of new staff members. Where the music department's activities were previously limited to musicals and music as a leaving certificate subject, there now exist an award-winning concert orchestra, a soul band, a Junior Concert Band, a Barbershop Ensemble and an award-winning choir. Spiritual life The College chaplain and members of the Vincentian Community are available for guidance and counselling. The school has always encouraged pupils to become involved in caring for the less- well-off members of society. =The College Chapel= Masses are held daily in the Boys' Chapel by members of the Vincentian community. An annual Family Mass for each Year is celebrated at which boys of that Year and their families participate together with the Community and teachers. Masses are held at regular times in the Chapel (e.g. Lent, Advent, Exam Time). Year and Class Masses, Benediction, scripture/prayer group meetings are held regularly throughout the year. Opportunity to attend the Sacrament of Reconciliation is available during the school week and also after Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament on Thursday nights. The College Chapel houses a large pipe organ which dates back to the early 1850s. The Chapel Organ was installed as a gift to the college community at the generosity of Charles-Gerrard, Brother of the Lord. It is used in college masses and services. =SVP ‚Äì Society of Saint Vincent de Paul= Castleknock College was established by the Congregation of the Mission (Vincentians), the religious order founded by St. Vincent de Paul; the college follows the ethos and traditions of the Vincentian order. The most popular student society within the College is the St. Vincent de Paul Society; charity work undertaken by the school community is organised through the St Vincent de Paul Society. Members are involved in helping the impoverished through a variety of means such as visiting local centres for people with special needs. The SVP conferences also raise funds and collect food for the sister conferences in the Dublin 15 area. =Castleknock Ambo Partnership= Inaugurated in 2008 and expected to continue indefinitely, the Young Vincentian Mission sends a small group of Fifth Year students to work and live with the Vincentian community in Ethiopia, for two to three weeks each summer, overseen by the VLM ‚Äì Vincentian Lay Missionaries. The first group in 2008 traveled to Mekelle in Northern Ethiopia and since 2009 the students have traveled to Ambo, Ethiopia. Successful applicants are trained and engage in a range of voluntary work for those struck by extreme poverty in Ambo, including teaching in the local Vincentian school, working in the Vincentian Food Programme, the Vincentian School for the Deaf, a leprosy village befriending members of the community and coaching Ambo United Football Club. Students are required to raise sufficient funds to meet their travel and subsistence expenses, and events are organised within and without the College to raise funds. This Development Programme has enabled the construction of expanded education facilities and the provision of medical and food supplies. Other extra‚Äìcurricular activities Extra‚Äìcurricular activities offered include membership of the Painting Society, the Chess Club, Irish literature ‚Äì Ceardlann Litr√≠ocht na Gaeilge, the Cumann Gaeilge, the Maths Society, the Prefect Mentoring System, Debating, Band, Music, Language societies (French, Spanish, German and Chinese), Book Club, student enterprise, SVP ‚Äì Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, Speech and Drama, charity work, the History Society and Picasso's Left Ear (Student Intellectual Publication). =Chess= In 2007 the Under-16 Chess team won the Leinster Championship and finished Runners Up in the All-Ireland Championship. Sixth Year student, Anthony Bourached, recently won the Leinster Under-18 Chess Championship. =Debating= Debating is a tradition dating back to the school's foundation. It was originally taught in the school curriculum during the Victorian era and was originally known as 'Public Oration'. There are separate clubs for junior and senior pupils. The school's debating society has contributed to the Irish World Schools Debating Team, with five students representing Ireland since the competition's beginning in 1988. In both 2007 (Alan Henry & Liam O'Connell) and 2008 (Adam Noonan & Killian Breen) the College won the Leinster Schools Senior Debating Championships. The Past Pupils' Union coordinates the annual College Union Debate where students and pastmen debate against each other. Past speakers at the Union Debate include former Attorney General Paul Gallagher, Professor Eunan O'Halpin, Mick Quinn and Irish Times correspondent Patsy McGarry. The college also holds gold medal debates for every academic year giving the students the opportunity to win the medal on prize day if they win the debate. The gold medal debates are used in sixth year to select an eligible Valedictorian for the year, who give his address at both the graduation mass and again at prize day. Former winners of the senior gold medal debates include the Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave, the Supreme Court Justice Anthony J. Hederman, Conor Gearty and Oisin Quinn SC.

Grounds Castleknock Castle and motte on the college grounds 2018. Castleknock Castle and College viewed from the Carpenterstown Road. There are two hills in the grounds: the Windmill Hill and the hill of the castle. The former is reputed to be the burial mound of Cumhal, father of Fionn mac Cumhail, a legendary Irish warrior. According to legend, Cumhal was interred here following his death at the Battle of Cnucha. An archaeological dig of this hill carried out in June 2007 revealed the remains of four human skeletons probably dating from the Early Christian period. The second hill is topped with the remains of Castleknock Castle which dates from the early thirteenth century, when it was founded by the Norman knight Hugh Tyrrell, who was later created Baron of Castleknock. He chose this location near the end of the esker which stretches from Galway to Dublin. Built on two mounds of the esker, it commanded the route into Dublin from the west. Castleknock was the final rallying point for the forces of the last High King of Ireland, Rory O'Connor. He failed to drive the Cambro-Normans from the area around Dublin in 1171. The college is set on 70 acres of landscaped parkland estate with nine rugby pitches, a cricket crease and pavilion, a soccer pitch, an athletics and running track, six state of the art tennis courts, an all-weather rugby practice pitch and agricultural land in which cows graze and wildlife such as pheasants, rabbits and squirrels are in abundance. There is car parking for students and others. The college is close to Castleknock village and is located beside Farmleigh Estate and the Phoenix Park. College Buildings The college consists mainly of three buildings, McNamara house, Cregan house and the Dowley house. The McNamara and Cregan buildings are connected via the foyer known as 'St Vincent's Hall'. McNamara house contain several other wings and Vincentian community facilities as well as other classrooms and subject specific rooms. McNamara House also contains the library, concert hall, day boys' refectory and the boarders refectory. =Building works 20052009= From 2005 the College infrastructure was renewed, at a cost in the region of ‚Ç¨16 million. A 'Link Building' was built, and existing buildings expanded and refurbished; Irish President Mary McAleese officially opened the newly restored buildings on 29 September 2008. A state-of-the-art multi purpose sports and tennis ground was recently built, allowing for students and others to enjoy various activities. Cultural associations The school featured indirectly but prominently in Gerard Siggins' series of novels Rugby Rebel as the shared basis of Castlerock College (a portmanteau of Castleknock College and Blackrock College), the boarding school which the protagonist Eoin attends. The popular fictional series starring Ross O'Carroll Kelly has mentioned Castleknock on a number of occasions in the books and Irish Times columns; the name of the fictional school the lead character attended was also Castlerock College. Popular media The 2016 Irish comedy-drama film Handsome Devil directed by John Butler was predominantly filmed at Castleknock and featured as the fictional all-boys boarding school 'Woodhill College'. It was screened in the Contemporary World Cinema section at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival. It centres on an ostracised teenager (Fionn O'Shea) at an elite rugby-obsessed all boys boarding school in Ireland whose new roommate (Nicholas Galitzine) is the school's new rugby star-player. The two form an unlikely friendship until it is tested by those around them. Handsome Devil has received critical acclaim, winning the award for Best Irish Feature of 2017 from the Dublin Film Critics' Circle;four nominations at the 2018 Irish Film and Television Academy (IFTA) Awards, including Best Feature Film; and the Best Single Drama Award at the annual Celtic Media Festival in 2018. Evelyn, the 2002 drama film loosely based on the true story of Desmond Doyle and his fight in the Irish courts (December 1955) to be reunited with his children was predominantly filmed at Castleknock and featured as the orphanage. The film stars Sophie Vavasseur in the title role, Pierce Brosnan as her father and Aidan Quinn, Julianna Margulies, Stephen Rea and Alan Bates as supporters to Doyle's case.

The movement is led by Brother Mike Velarde, a real estate developer and preacher. Manila auxiliary bishop Most Rev. Teodoro C. Bacani, Jr. serves as its spiritual adviser.  History  Inspired by his recovery from a heart ailment in 1978, Mike Velarde started a weekly Bible-quoting radio show on DWXI, a station he acquired in 1982 as part of a real estate deal. Listeners, he says, began reporting that his voice had cured their afflictions.\\"Pacman deep into Bible study.\\" Filipino Reporter 23 Mar. 2012: 21. Newspaper Source Plus. Web. 15 Feb. 2013. In 1984, Velarde called his show \\"El Shaddai,\\" a biblical name for God that he found in an American religious pamphlet. Velarde then held monthly prayer rallies outside the vicinity of the radio station. As the number of attendees kept growing, he made the rallies weekly until the crowd could no longer be accommodated by the area. The rallies were then moved to various locations such as a football stadium and then transferring several times to the Quirino Grandstand at Rizal Park in Manila; the open grounds outside the Philippine International Convention Center and the Cultural Center of the Philippines in Pasay City near Manila Bay; and finally in Amvel Business Park, Barangay San Dionisio, Para√±aque (a site owned by the family) in order to accommodate the movement's followers. In 1992, Velarde and the movement has expanded to television, when the movement taking its programming airtime on the government owned broadcasting network Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation with the Sunday late night delayed broadcast of the weekly Saturday Family Appointments, and the broadcasts of the weekly Family Appointments becomes the sixth longest-reigning religious program in Philippine television history. In addition, the movement also produced the faith-based drama anthology series Mga Himala at Gintong Aral ni El Shaddai from 1994 until its cancellation in 1997. Velarde himself serves as the host for the series. In 1998, Velarde and Jesus Is Lord Church leader Eddie Villanueva engaged in a legal battle over control of the Christian television station DZOE-TV (Channel 11). Villanueva has the franchise and the authority to operate the facility, but Velarde, using political connections, was able to import transmission equipment, the value of which he claims to have converted into equity in the station. Congress intervened and awarded Villanueva the right the acquire the frequency, with him paying Velarde for the stock and assets held by Delta Broadcasting System (DBS). El Shaddai Movement has grown rapidly in the last decade and, as of 2005, had a reported 8 million members worldwide.Philippines: International Religious Freedom Report. U.S. Department of State (2005). On August 20, 2009, El Shaddai inaugurated a ‚Ç±1 billion (approx. US$21 million at the time) House of Prayer on a ten hectare site in Amvel Business Park. The cost does not include the land, which will be paid for over 20 years. The building is 10,000 square meters and seats 16,000 with standing room for another 25,000, with space on the site for an overflow of the crowd.\\"El Shaddai P1-B church opens today\\". CBCP News. The building was inaugurated by Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, the fourteenth President of the Philippines, on Velarde's 70th birthday.\\"Velarde opens El Shaddai church\\". The Philippine Daily Inquirer. As it is a Roman Catholic movement, its diocesan bishop is Rev Jessie Mercado of the Diocese of Para√±aque, while its Spiritual Director is the Bishop Emeritus of Novaliches Teodoro Bacani. Political influence Conspiracy theorists propagate the belief that El Shaddai plays a major role in Philippine politics. They assert that former President Fidel V. Ramos won the 1992 general election because of the movement's votes, although this has never been corroborated with an actual tally of votes correlated with El Shaddai membership rosters. Moreover, the Catholic Church, of which El Shaddai is an apostolate, refrains from interfering in temporal matters and, as such, does not dictate to its members which candidates to support or oppose.Lockwood, R. P. (2008, July 11). \\"Catholic urban legends: The Catholic vote \\". Catholic Answers.Akin, J. (2015, September 18). \\"Is voting for pro- abortion politicians sinful?\\" Catholic Answers. In the same vein, individual members of the Catholic Church are free to form voting blocs that are independent from the Church itself, as in the case of Catholic Vote. During the impeachment trial of President Joseph Estrada in late 2000, Velarde, in line with Catholic teaching regarding temporal matters, rejected the call of then-Archbishop of Manila Jaime Cardinal Sin to join a prayer rally urging Estrada to resign. Velarde said that El Shaddai members were free to join the rally of their own volition and reiterated that the movement was neither for nor against Estrada's resignation. It was reported that Velarde attempted to end a 2005 Philippine electoral crisis by uniting the Estrada and Arroyo camps.Velarde: Arroyo open to joint rule with foes (archived from the original on 2007-03-11).  Controversy  In 2005, Katharine L. Wiegele said that El Shaddai has spread prosperity theology outside Protestant Christianity in the Philippines.

Grammar Middle Irish inscription from Clonmacnoise: Oroit ar Thurcain lasan dernad in chrossa: \\"Pray for Turcan by whom this cross was made.\\" Middle Irish is a fusional, VSO, nominative-accusative language. Nouns decline for two genders: masculine, feminine, though traces of neuter declension persist; three numbers: singular, dual, plural; and five cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, prepositional, vocative. Adjectives agree with nouns in gender, number, and case. Verbs conjugate for three tenses: past, present, future; four moods: indicative, subjunctive, conditional, imperative; independent and dependent forms. Verbs conjugate for three persons and an impersonal, agentless form (agent). There are a number of preverbal particles marking the negative, interrogative, subjunctive, relative clauses, etc. Prepositions inflect for person and number. Different prepositions govern different cases, depending on intended semantics. Example The following is a poem in Middle Irish about E√≥gan B√©l, King of Connacht.

Organization The group consists of two battalions from the Singapore Combat Engineers -- the 36th and the 39th, specializing in Explosive Ordnance Disposal and chemical, biological and radiological defence respectively. CBRE work closely with the Medical Response Force (MRF) which is the Elite medical arm of the Singapore Armed Forces Medical Corps. The MRF main task is to manage and treat casualties from a chemical or biological attack. The CBRE's task on the other hand is to secure and clear the area during a chemical or biological attack. MRF comes directly under FMPC, HQ Medical Corps. Notable exercises On 17 January 2003, CBRE Defence Group conducted an exercise code-named Exercise Diamond Shield to demonstrate its capability in counter-terrorism. Another exercise was conducted on 20 January 2006, with simulated multiple CBRE incidents. In September 2005, CBRE Defence Group took part in a bilateral exercise with Australia code-named Star Lion in Sydney, to enhance its preventive and responsive capabilities.

Easy Cheese on a pretzel Easy Cheese is the trademark for a processed cheese spread product distributed by Mondelƒìz International. It is also referred to as aerosol cheese, spray cheese or simply cheese in a can, and is similar to squeeze cheese (a semi-solid cheesefood from the 1970s packaged in a squeezable plastic tube). Easy Cheese is packaged in a metal can filled with air covered with a plastic cap that reveals a straight, flexible nozzle where the cheese is extruded. The product was first manufactured and marketed by Nabisco in 1965 under the name Snack Mate until 1984. Advertisements often displayed the orange product adorned in flowy peaks atop several different types of Hors d'oeuvres. As a 1966 advertisement says, it was ‚Äúinstant cheese for instant parties.\\"Rivas, N. (2016, April 28). A Brief History of Easy Cheese. Retrieved December 3, 2016, from https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/04/a-brief-history-of-easy- cheese.html Easy Cheese is currently available in Cheddar, Sharp Cheddar, Cheddar 'n Bacon, and American flavors. Discontinued varieties include Pimento, French Onion, Cheddar Blue Cheese, Shrimp Cocktail, and Pizza. Ingredients Easy Cheese contains milk, water, whey protein concentrate, canola oil, milk protein concentrate, sodium citrate, sodium phosphate, calcium phosphate, lactic acid, sorbic acid, sodium alginate, apocarotenal, annatto, cheese culture, and enzymes.Product Detail: Easy Cheese (nabiscoworld.com)  Physical-chemical properties  = Molecular composition = Processed cheese spreads, like Easy Cheese, have a moisture content that ranges from 44‚Äì60%, while its milk fat content must be greater than 20%.Kapoor, R., & Metzger, L. E. (2008, March). Process Cheese: Scientific and Technological Aspects‚ÄîA Review. Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety, 7(2), 194‚Äì214. doi:10.1111/j.1541-4337.2008.00040.x Milk proteins are needed for processed cheese spread production, and contains two main types: casein, which accounts for at least 80%, and whey protein, which can further be classified into Œ±-lactalbumin and Œ≤-lactoglobulin. The manufacturing of processed cheese spreads uses natural cheese with a composition that ranges from 60‚Äì75% intact casein.Chatziantoniou, S. E., Thomareis, A. S., & Kontominas, M. G.

Eur Food Res Technol, (241), 737‚Äì748. doi:10.1007/s00217-015-2499-6  Water  Water plays a multitude of functions in Easy Cheese. First, it allows for more stable emulsion, serving as a medium for the hydrophilic moieties of chelating salts. More specially, chelating salts bind calcium ions to hydrate proteins and create a more uniform spread. Water also provides the moisture content needed in processed cheese spreads to achieve the desired texture.Lee, S. K., Anema, S., & Klostermeyer, H. (2004, February 18). The influence of moisture content on the rheological properties of processed cheese spreads. International Journal of Food Science and Technology, (39), 763‚Äì771. doi:10.1111/j.1365-2621.2004.00842.x Excessive water, however, can result in a lack of viscosity resulting in a cheese spread that has more liquid than solid properties after passing through the plastic extruder. The addition of too much water may likewise increase the product‚Äôs susceptibility to microbial growth. = Physical structure =  Casein and emulsifying agents  Easy Cheese is an oil-in-water emulsion. Oil droplets typically have a diameter of no more than one micrometer. Emulsions with large droplets like this tend to have a low-medium viscosity in comparison to smaller droplets whose emulsions have a higher viscosity. Heating the cheese mixture causes separation of the fats and protein of the cheese emulsion from destabilization. Emulsifying agents are made up of amphiphilic molecules that act as an interface to reduce the surface tension between hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules of the product to result in a uniform cheese spread that does not separate during storage. Cheese proteins that have denatured during processing are reestablished using melting salts.Trivedi, D., Bennett, R. J., Hemar, Y., Reid, D. C., Lee, S. K., & Illingworth, D. (2008, August 29).

The key role of emulsifying agents in Easy Cheese is to create a uniform cheese spread by altering the structure of casein micelles in the cheese. Casein micelles have a diameter ranging from 15‚Äì20 nanometers and are composed of flexible aggregates alpha-, beta-, and kappa-casein. The alpha- and beta-casein are kept in place by ‚Äúcolloidal calcium phosphate-mediated cross links‚Äù covered with a kappa-casein outer layer. The outer layer on the casein‚Äôs surface has glycosylated hydrophilic tails that are negatively charged and is stable in solution due to Van der Waals interactions. All of the negative charges causes the casein micelles to initially repel each other and provides stability to the matrix by protecting the alpha- and beta- caseins.Caric, M., Gantar, M., & Kalab, M. (1985, October 6). Effects of Emulsifying Agents on the Microstructure and Other Characteristics of Process Cheese ‚Äì A Review. Food Microstructure, 4(2), 13th ser., 297‚Äì312. Retrieved November 28, 2016, from http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1105&context;=foodmicrostructure When the group of casein micelles are exposed to heat and shearing forces, kappa-casein is cleaved causing the displacement of the glycosylated hydrophilic tails. The casein micelle becomes destabilized as alpha and beta- casein are now exposed to the environment. Emulsifying agents such as sodium phosphate play an important role in stabilizing the newly destabilized structure. The hydrophilic portion of sodium phosphate removes calcium from the calcium paracaseinate from ion exchange reactions. This action causes ‚Äúhydration and partial dispersion of the calcium-paracaseinate phosphate network.\\" The hydration process increases the solubility of the protein. Sodium phosphate removes calcium from the Ca-paracaseinate cheese complex due to ion exchange interactions, where positive calcium ions bind to the negative phosphate groups. Phosphate and citrate anions can then bind to the protein structure, converting calcium-paracaseinate converts to water-soluble sodium- paracaseinate. Upon cooling, the partially dispersed matrix forms a gel-like network that gives rise to the textural properties of the final product.  Viscosity  The interactions between proteins and carbohydrates play an important role in the viscosity of processed spreads. More specifically, sodium alginate contributes to the integrity of the gel-like network formed by the casein and salts. The newly formed network is made possible through cation binding, which converts the hydrophilic sodium alginate into hydrophobic calcium alginate (Ma). Guluronic acid residues that are linked together demonstrate a high affinity for calcium ions. Sodium alginate works in conjunction with the destabilization of the casein micelle where calcium ions can interact with guluronic chains (Ma). Due to a mixture of these interactions, a gel-like structure is formed rather than a true gel structure. Whey products in processed cheese spreads increases the viscosity of the overall product due to the ‚Äúintermolecular interactions between adjacent protein molecules with the formation of weak transient networks‚Äù formed from the conglomerate cheese mass.Solowiej, B.

Therefore, the continuous phase of the oil-in-water emulsion has a greater contribution to the viscosity of the cheese product over than the discontinuous phase.Trivedi, D., Bennett, R.

Retrieved December 3, 2016, from As cheese is pushed out of the can shear rate increases causing a decrease in viscosity and higher flow rates of the material. In this case, the cheese behaves more as a fluid. After it is expelled, there is no more shear rate and the cheese retains its original higher viscosity. Here, the cheese behaves like a solid. Easy Cheese must provide a smooth uniform texture whilst maintaining its viscoelastic structure to maintain its shape after extrusion from the can. Sodium alginate is the one of the main ingredients that is responsible for Easy Cheese's pseudoplastic characteristics. More specifically, it contributes to the integrity of the gel-like network formed by the casein and salts. The newly formed network is made possible through cation binding, which converts the hydrophilic sodium alginate into hydrophobic calcium alginate. Guluronic acid residues that are linked together demonstrate a high affinity for calcium ions. Sodium alginate works in conjunction with the destabilization of the casein micelle where calcium ions can interact with guluronic chains. Due to a mixture of these interactions, a gel-like structure is formed rather than a true gel structure. About 0.05‚Äì0.5% weight by volume of sodium alginate at a 5.4‚Äì5.7 range must be added to the cheese mixture to exhibit these properties during extrusion. Can design Although sometimes called ‚Äúaerosol cheese‚Äù, its container is not actually an aerosol spray can, because the cheese does not usually combine with a propellant (such as nitrogen) to turn into a fine mist upon being sprayed. Rather, the can contains a piston and a barrier plastic cap which squeezes the cheese through the nozzle in a solid column when the nozzle is pressed and the propellant expands in volume. The propellant does not mix with the cheese. Normal aerosol cans are charged with all of their contents through the single opening at the top, but spray cheese cans are separately charged with the product through the top and propellant through the bottom. This explains why the can has a small rubber plug on its base. The can design also ensures that the cheese can be dispensed with the can upright or inverted.

Noise generation can also be associated with periodically varying flows. A notable example of this phenomenon is the Aeolian tones produced by wind blowing over fixed objects. Although no complete scientific theory of the generation of noise by aerodynamic flows has been established, most practical aeroacoustic analysis relies upon the so-called aeroacoustic analogy, proposed by Sir James Lighthill in the 1950s while at the University of Manchester. whereby the governing equations of motion of the fluid are coerced into a form reminiscent of the wave equation of \\"classical\\" (i.e. linear) acoustics in the left-hand side with the remaining terms as sources in the right-hand side. History The modern discipline of aeroacoustics can be said to have originated with the first publication of Lighthill in the early 1950s, when noise generation associated with the jet engine was beginning to be placed under scientific scrutiny. Lighthill's equation Lighthill rearranged the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations, which govern the flow of a compressible viscous fluid, into an inhomogeneous wave equation, thereby making a connection between fluid mechanics and acoustics. This is often called \\"Lighthill's analogy\\" because it presents a model for the acoustic field that is not, strictly speaking, based on the physics of flow-induced/generated noise, but rather on the analogy of how they might be represented through the governing equations of a compressible fluid. The first equation of interest is the conservation of mass equation, which reads :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho}{\\\\partial t} + abla\\\\cdot\\\\left(\\\\rho\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{D\\\\rho}{D t} + \\\\rho abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{v}= 0, where \\\\rho and \\\\mathbf{v} represent the density and velocity of the fluid, which depend on space and time, and D/Dt is the substantial derivative. Next is the conservation of momentum equation, which is given by :{\\\\rho}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{v}}{\\\\partial t}+{\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot abla)\\\\mathbf{v}} = - abla p+ abla\\\\cdot\\\\sigma, where p is the thermodynamic pressure, and \\\\sigma is the viscous (or traceless) part of the stress tensor from the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations. Now, multiplying the conservation of mass equation by \\\\mathbf{v} and adding it to the conservation of momentum equation gives :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}\\\\left(\\\\rho\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\right) + abla\\\\cdot(\\\\rho\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{v}) = - abla p + abla\\\\cdot\\\\sigma. Note that \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{v} is a tensor (see also tensor product). Differentiating the conservation of mass equation with respect to time, taking the divergence of the last equation and subtracting the latter from the former, we arrive at :\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\rho}{\\\\partial t^2} - abla^2 p + abla\\\\cdot abla\\\\cdot\\\\sigma = abla\\\\cdot abla\\\\cdot(\\\\rho\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{v}). Subtracting c_0^2 abla^2\\\\rho, where c_0 is the speed of sound in the medium in its equilibrium (or quiescent) state, from both sides of the last equation and rearranging it results in :\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\rho}{\\\\partial t^2}-c^2_0 abla^2\\\\rho = abla\\\\cdot\\\\left[ abla\\\\cdot(\\\\rho\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{v})- abla\\\\cdot\\\\sigma + abla p-c^2_0 abla\\\\rho\\\\right], which is equivalent to :\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\rho}{\\\\partial t^2}-c^2_0 abla^2\\\\rho=( abla\\\\otimes abla) :\\\\left[\\\\rho\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{v} - \\\\sigma + (p-c^2_0\\\\rho)\\\\mathbb{I}\\\\right], where \\\\mathbb{I} is the identity tensor, and : denotes the (double) tensor contraction operator. The above equation is the celebrated Lighthill equation of aeroacoustics. It is a wave equation with a source term on the right-hand side, i.e. an inhomogeneous wave equation. The argument of the \\"double-divergence operator\\" on the right-hand side of last equation, i.e. \\\\rho\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{v}-\\\\sigma+(p-c^2_0\\\\rho)\\\\mathbb{I}, is the so-called Lighthill turbulence stress tensor for the acoustic field, and it is commonly denoted by T. Using Einstein notation, Lighthill‚Äôs equation can be written as :\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\rho}{\\\\partial t^2}-c^2_0 abla^2\\\\rho=\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2T_{ij}}{\\\\partial x_i \\\\partial x_j},\\\\quad (*) where :T_{ij}=\\\\rho v_i v_j - \\\\sigma_{ij} + (p- c^2_0\\\\rho)\\\\delta_{ij}, and \\\\delta_{ij} is the Kronecker delta. Each of the acoustic source terms, i.e. terms in T_{ij}, may play a significant role in the generation of noise depending upon flow conditions considered. \\\\rho v_i v_j describes unsteady convection of flow (or Reynolds' Stress, developed by Osborne Reynolds), \\\\sigma_{ij} describes sound generated by viscosity, and (p- c^2_0\\\\rho)\\\\delta_{ij} describes non-linear acoustic generation processes. In practice, it is customary to neglect the effects of viscosity on the fluid, i.e. one takes \\\\sigma=0, because it is generally accepted that the effects of the latter on noise generation, in most situations, are orders of magnitude smaller than those due to the other terms. Lighthill provides an in-depth discussion of this matter. In aeroacoustic studies, both theoretical and computational efforts are made to solve for the acoustic source terms in Lighthill's equation in order to make statements regarding the relevant aerodynamic noise generation mechanisms present. Finally, it is important to realize that Lighthill's equation is exact in the sense that no approximations of any kind have been made in its derivation.  Related model equations  In their classical text on fluid mechanics, Landau and LifshitzL. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz, Fluid Mechanics 2ed., Course of Theoretical Physics vol. 6, Butterworth-Heinemann (1987) ¬ß75. derive an aeroacoustic equation analogous to Lighthill's (i.e., an equation for sound generated by \\"turbulent\\" fluid motion), but for the incompressible flow of an inviscid fluid. The inhomogeneous wave equation that they obtain is for the pressure p rather than for the density \\\\rho of the fluid. Furthermore, unlike Lighthill's equation, Landau and Lifshitz's equation is not exact; it is an approximation. If one is to allow for approximations to be made, a simpler way (without necessarily assuming the fluid is incompressible) to obtain an approximation to Lighthill's equation is to assume that p-p_0=c_0^2(\\\\rho-\\\\rho_0), where \\\\rho_0 and p_0 are the (characteristic) density and pressure of the fluid in its equilibrium state. Then, upon substitution the assumed relation between pressure and density into (*) \\\\, we obtain the equation (for an inviscid fluid, œÉ = 0) :\\\\frac{1}{c_0^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 p}{\\\\partial t^2}- abla^2p=\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\tilde{T}_{ij}}{\\\\partial x_i \\\\partial x_j},\\\\quad\\\\text{where}\\\\quad\\\\tilde{T}_{ij} = \\\\rho v_i v_j. And for the case when the fluid is indeed incompressible, i.e. \\\\rho=\\\\rho_0 (for some positive constant \\\\rho_0) everywhere, then we obtain exactly the equation given in Landau and Lifshitz, namely :\\\\frac{1}{c_0^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 p}{\\\\partial t^2}- abla^2p=\\\\rho_0\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\hat{T}_{ij}}{\\\\partial x_i \\\\partial x_j},\\\\quad\\\\text{where}\\\\quad\\\\hat{T}_{ij} = v_i v_j. A similar approximation [in the context of equation (*)\\\\,], namely T\\\\approx\\\\rho_0\\\\hat T, is suggested by Lighthill [see Eq. (7) in the latter paper]. Of course, one might wonder whether we are justified in assuming that p-p_0=c_0^2(\\\\rho-\\\\rho_0). The answer is affirmative, if the flow satisfies certain basic assumptions. In particular, if \\\\rho \\\\ll \\\\rho_0 and p \\\\ll p_0, then the assumed relation follows directly from the linear theory of sound waves (see, e.g., the linearized Euler equations and the acoustic wave equation). In fact, the approximate relation between p and \\\\rho that we assumed is just a linear approximation to the generic barotropic equation of state of the fluid. However, even after the above deliberations, it is still not clear whether one is justified in using an inherently linear relation to simplify a nonlinear wave equation. Nevertheless, it is a very common practice in nonlinear acoustics as the textbooks on the subject show: e.g., Naugolnykh and OstrovskyK. Naugolnykh and L.

The instrument was initially developed in its acoustic form by Gibson and C.F. Martin so that players of the four-string tenor banjo could double on guitar.The Stringed Instrument Database  Construction  Tenor guitars are four-stringed instruments normally made in the shape of a guitar, or sometimes with a lute-like pear shaped body or, more rarely, with a round banjo-like wooden body. They can be acoustic, electric or both and they can come in the form of flat top or archtop wood-bodied, metal-bodied resonator, or solid- bodied instruments. Tenor guitars normally have a scale length similar to that of the tenor banjo and octave mandolin of between .  History and development  1928 Dobro‚Äìstyle 37 tenor guitar The earliest origins of the tenor guitar are not clear, but it seems unlikely that a true four-stringed guitar-shaped tenor guitar appeared before the late 1920s. Gibson built the tenor lute TL-4 in 1924, which had a lute-like pear-shaped body, four strings and a tenor banjo neck. It is possible that similar instruments were made by other makers such as Lyon and Healy and banjo makers, such as Bacon. In the same period, banjo makers, such as Paramount, built transitional round banjo-like wood- bodied instruments with four strings and tenor banjo necks called tenor harps. From 1927 onwards, the very first true wood-bodied acoustic tenor guitars appeared as production instruments made by both Gibson and Martin. Almost all the major guitar makers, including Epiphone, Kay, Gretsch, Guild and National Reso-Phonic, have manufactured tenor (and plectrum) guitars as production instruments at various times. Budget tenor guitars by makers such as Harmony, Regal and Stella, were produced in large numbers in the 1950s and 1960s. National, formed by the Dopyera Brothers, also made significant numbers of resonator tenor and plectrum guitars between the 1920s and 1940s. Dobro, another company associated with the Dopyera Brothers, as well as National, also built various resonator tenor guitar models. In 1934, Gibson introduced an acoustic archtop tenor guitar, the TG-50, based on the acoustic archtop six string model, the L-50, with its production run lasting until 1958. In 1936 Gibson introduced the world's first commercially successful electric Spanish- style guitar, the ES-150. In early 1937 Gibson also began shipping two other versions of the ES-150: a tenor guitar (the EST-150, with four strings and a 23\\" scale, renamed the ETG-150 in 1940) and a plectrum version (the EPG-150, with a 27\\" scale). The ETG-150, was in continuous production until 1972. In the mid-1950s electric solid-body tenor guitar models began to appear from companies such as Gibson, Gretsch, Guild, and Epiphone. These were mostly produced as one-off custom instruments but, for a short time in 1955, Gretsch manufactured an electric solid-bodied tenor guitar, the Gretsch 6127 DuoJet. Renewed interest in the tenor guitar led to the introduction of new solid-body electric models in the early 21st century, with companies such as Fender beginning production of a tenor version of their Telecaster model.  Tuning  Tenor guitars are normally tuned in fifths (usually C3 G3 D4 A4, similar to the tenor banjo, mandola, or the viola) although other tunings are also common, such as \\"Chicago tuning\\" (D3 G3 B3 E4, same as the top four strings of a standard guitar or a baritone ukulele), \\"Irish\\" or \\"octave\\" tuning (G2 D3 A3 E4, like an octave mandolin or tenor violin, one octave below the usual violin/mandolin tuning) and various \\"open\\" tunings, for slide playing. The tenor guitar can also be tuned like a soprano/concert/tenor ukulele, using various versions of G3 C4 E4 A4 tuning.  Related instruments  National- style \\"plectrum guitar\\" There are versions of the tenor guitar with four strings but a scale length of around , similar to that of a six string guitar. As string tension for any pitch increases with length, some have said these guitars cannot be tuned to the normal CGDA fifths tuning because the A string cannot be tuned to pitch without breaking. However, there are a variety of available methods for addressing this point and bringing the longer-scaled tenor guitar up to standard tuning and pitch: special string sets; strings extracted from a seven string guitar set; etc. The longer scale instrument can alternately and safely be tuned to GDAE. Tenor guitars can also be tuned to a reentrant CGDA tuning where the A and sometimes the D are pitched an octave lower. The \\"plectrum guitar\\" is a close four stringed relative of the tenor guitar with a longer scale length of and tunings usually based on the plectrum banjo - CGBD or DGBD. Plectrum guitars are also very suitable for guitar tuning‚ÄìDGBE‚Äìbecause of their longer scale length but are much less suitable for CGDA tuning because of the high A string. Plectrum guitars were not made in as large numbers as tenor guitars and are now rarer. Plectrum guitars played a similar role for plectrum banjo players in this period as the tenor guitar, but they were less common. One of the best known plectrum guitarists from the Jazz Age was Eddie Condon, who started out on banjo in the 1920s and then switched to a Gibson L7 plectrum guitar in the 1930s and stayed with it all his musical life up to the 1960s.  Use and performers  Tenor guitars are now very closely associated with the tenor banjo with its similar standard CGDA fifths tuning and they initially came to significant commercial prominence in the late 1920s and early 1930s as tenor banjos were slowly being replaced by six string guitars in jazz bands and dance orchestras. Tenor banjo players could double on tenor guitars to get a guitar sound without having to learn the six string guitar. This is a practice still carried out by many contemporary jazz banjo players. This period is generally regarded as the initial \\"golden age\\" of the tenor guitar. Two of the McKendrick brothers, confusingly both named Mike - \\"Big\\" Mike and \\"Little\\" Mike, doubled on tenor banjo and tenor guitar in jazz bands dating from the 1920s. According to Bob Brozman in his book on National instruments, The History and Artistry of National Instruments, they both played National tenor guitars and they are both shown in the book in photos with their National tenor guitars. \\"Big\\" Mike McKendrick both managed and played with Louis Armstrong bands while \\"Little\\" Mike McKendrick played with various bands, including Tony Parenti. Brozman's book also features photos of Hawaiian music bands that include players with both National tenor and plectrum guitars. The Delmore Brothers were a very influential pioneering country music duo from the early 1930s to the late 1940s that featured the tenor guitar. The Delmore Brothers were one of the original country vocal harmonising sibling acts that established the mold for later similar acts, such as the Louvin Brothers, and even later, the Everly Brothers. The younger of the Delmore brothers, Rabon, played the tenor guitar as an accompaniment to his older brother, Alton's, six string guitar. Rabon favoured the Martin 0-18T tenor guitar and the Louvin Brothers later recorded a tribute album to the Delmores that featured Rabon's Martin 0-18T tenor played by mandolinist Ira Louvin, but tuned as the four treble guitar strings. Another 1930s band that featured the tenor guitar was the Hoosier Hotshots, commonly considered the creators of mid-western rural jazz. Their leader, Ken Trietsch, played the tenor guitar, as well as doubling on the tuba. 1932 C.F. Martin 0-18 T sunburst In British Columbia, Canada, Professor Douglas Fraser plays thirties jazz with \\"The Genuine Jug Band\\" on a 1939 Gibson arch top tenor guitar. A musical style called Texas fiddling uses the tenor guitar as part of its rhythm accompaniment. Well known exponents of the tenor guitar in Texas fiddle music include Jerry Thomassen, Al Mouledous, and Gary Lee Moore. Thomassen has a signature tenor guitar named after him that is built by luthier Steve Parks. Gary Lee Moore has produced an excellent teaching resource for playing the tenor guitar as backup for Texas fiddling, entitled Getting Started in Fiddle Backup, obtainable as a free pdf download on the Tenor Guitar Registry discussion board web site. In the early 1930s Selmer Guitars in Paris manufactured four string guitars based on guitar designs by the Italian luthier Mario Maccaferri that they marketed to banjo players as a second six-string guitar-like instrument. The two main four string Selmer models included a regular tenor guitar with a smaller body and a 23-inch scale length, tuned CGDA, and the Eddie Freeman Special, with a larger body and a longer scale length, using a reentrant CGDA tuning. The Eddie Freeman Special had been designed by English tenor banjoist Eddie Freeman to have a better six string guitar sonority for rhythm guitar work than the normal tenor guitar with its very high A string. However, it was still tuned CGDA so that it could still be played by tenor banjoists. The Eddie Freeman Special was based on a six string model and it had a larger six string body and a six string scale length of 25.25 inches, rather than the tenor's smaller body and normal 23 inch scale length. The CGDA tuning used was re-entrant with the C and D tuned in the same octave and the G and the A tuned in the same octave, lowering the overall tone. The tuning and scale length give this very unusual four string guitar a sonority that is very close to that of the six string guitar, compared to a regular tenor guitar. Selmer heavily promoted the EFS guitar through the Melody Maker and Eddie Freeman even wrote a special tune for it called 'In All Sincerity'. There are also promotional photos of the well-known British singer, banjoist and guitarist Al Bowlly, playing the Eddie Freeman Special and it can be seen in use by Ray Noble's guitarist in a recording session photo of his orchestra. This guitar was not commercially successful in the 1930s, possibly due to concerted resistance by the British six-string guitar fraternity, particularly Ivor Mairants. Many were subsequently converted to much more valuable six-string models because of the Django Reinhardt connection. Originals of the Eddie Freeman Special are now very rare and are consequently highly valuable. Within the last three years, modern Maccaferri-style luthiers, such as the late David Hodson in the UK and Shelley Park in Canada, as well as others, have started building this four string model again due to demand from their customers. Many have now been made and they are becoming more widely played. They are considered to have a beautiful sound and offer a very broad range of tuning possibilities including CGDA, GDAE, DGBE, CGBD, DGBD and ADGB. As the six string guitar eventually became more popular in bands in the 1930s and 1940s, tenor guitars became much less played, although some tenor guitar models had been made in very large numbers throughout this period and are now still common. Tenor guitars came to prominence again in the 1950s and 1960s, possibly due to the effects of the Dixieland jazz revival and the folk music boom. At this time, they were made by makers such as Epiphone, Gibson, Guild and Gretsch as archtop acoustics and/or electrics, as well as a range of flat top models by Martin. Around this time in the 1950s and 1960s, electric tenor guitars were also referred to as \\"lead guitars,\\" although the rationale for this is not now clear, unless it was for marketing purposes. Lead playing on a six string guitar often involves just using its top four strings. A major player of the electric tenor as a lead guitarist in the bebop and rhythm and blues styles from the 1940s to the 1970s was the jazz guitarist Tiny Grimes, who recorded with Cats and The Fiddle, Charlie Parker, Art Tatum and others. Tiny used guitar (DGBE) tuning on his tenor guitars, rather than tenor CGDA tuning. The Martin 0-18T flat top acoustic tenor guitar was played in the late 1950s by Nick Reynolds of The Kingston Trio. The acoustic tenor guitar became a popular instrument in the folk music boom of this period, particularly this model. In 1997, as a tribute to the Kingston Trio, Martin re-issued 34 limited edition 40th-anniversary commemorative sets (40 sets had been planned, but only 34 orders were received and executed) of the three main instruments used by the Kingston Trio to celebrate their founding in 1957.

Eastwood Guitars Warren Ellis Signature Tenor Guitar Review PremierGuitar.com, accessed 20 June 2017 Tenor guitars can be difficult to locate outside the United States since from the late 1920s when they were first produced, they were mostly manufactured in the United States. Up until relatively recently they were usually regarded as musical oddities with little value but now they are becoming very attractive to both players and collectors, particularly the National resonator instruments Production tenor guitars by Gibson and Martin from the 1940s to the 1960s are still generally available, such as Gibson's ETG-150 electric/acoustic archtop tenor guitar and Martin's 0-18T acoustic flat top tenor guitar. Original tenor guitars in good condition by any of the major guitar makers are considered very desirable, either as instruments for playing, or as interesting collectibles in their own right. Some specially ordered custom tenor guitar models from makers, such as Gibson, can be extremely rare since only one of the particular model may only have been manufactured. As noted above, in the pre-WW2 period, Gibson offered either the tenor or plectrum guitar version of any model they made at no extra cost to the purchaser. There has been increase in the number of artists who feature the tenor guitar in their music. Prominent UK users of the tenor guitar include the Lakeman brothers, Seth Lakeman and Sean Lakeman, and John McCusker and Ian Carr, who both play with the Kate Rusby Band. Terry Bohner, a character in the mockumentary film A Mighty Wind about the U.S. folk music era of the 1950s and 1960s, uses a tenor guitar.

Early life Born in Notting Hill, London, on 19 November 1909, Jones was the 5th child of William Thomas Jones and Harriet Eleanor J. Doughty (1878‚Äì1973), a Welsh-speaking dairy owner. In 1930 Jones was studying law at University College London when Kenneth Barnes, the Principal of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, noticed him in a student performance and offered him a career as an actor. His first professional engagement was in Carpet Slippers at the Embassy Theatre, Swiss Cottage, in 1930, while still at RADA. He won the annual RADA Gold Medal in 1932. Career His first West End production was Vile Bodies at the Vaudeville and Richard of Bordeaux (in which he appeared with John Gielgud) at the No√´l Coward Theatre. The following year he appeared with Laurence Olivier in The Rats of Norway. In 1932 he made his film debut, in The Faithful Heart, and he continued to appear in British films throughout the 1930s. He achieved success on the London stage and on Broadway as \\"Caryl Sanger\\" in the play, Escape Me Never, with Elizabeth Bergner, and also starred with her in the 1935 film version. In 1940 he joined the British Army, but spent most of the Second World War in a touring concert party, returning to the West End in 1945 to star in Lady Windermere's Fan. He then became a fairly big star of the British cinema in the late 1940s, showing a particular talent for comedies. He was the leading man in a number of films, including Miranda (1948), opposite Glynis Johns and Googie Withers, and Once Upon a Dream (1949), opposite Withers again. He was mainly seen in supporting roles from the mid-1950s onwards, among the most prominent being in the film The Sea Shall Not Have Them (1954). He still played occasional lead roles, notably as a husband who tries to have his wife murdered in the crime thriller Kill Her Gently (1957). Royal Shakespeare Company He was a stalwart of the Royal Shakespeare Company, appearing in 50 productions with the company between 1975 and 1999. His first season was in director Buzz Goodbody's noted opening year at The Other Place theatre, playing the Ghost to Ben Kingsley's Hamlet and Sir William Stanley in Perkin Warbeck. His later roles included Duncan, opposite Ian McKellen, in Macbeth, Antigonus in The Winter's Tale, Aegeon in A Comedy of Errors, Gower in Pericles, Prince of Tyre, The Comedy of Errors, Chebutiken and Ferrapont in separate productions of Chekhov's Three Sisters and Tim Linkinwater and Fluggers in Nicholas Nickleby. His last role, at the age of 90, was Tubal in The Merchant of Venice. Personal life and death Jones was married to actress Irene Isaac (known as \\"Robin\\") from 1932 until her death in 1985. They had two children, who both became actors: Gemma Jones (who was named after the main character in Escape Me Never) and Nicholas Jones. Jones died in his sleep from natural causes at his home in London, England, on 30 January 2007 aged 97.

Herbrand: Recherches sur la th√©orie de la d√©monstration. Travaux de la soci√©t√© des Sciences et des Lettres de Varsovie, Class III, Sciences Math√©matiques et Physiques, 33, 1930. It essentially allows a certain kind of reduction of first-order logic to propositional logic. Although Herbrand originally proved his theorem for arbitrary formulas of first-order logic,Samuel R. Buss: \\"Handbook of Proof Theory\\". Chapter 1, \\"An Introduction to Proof Theory\\". Elsevier, 1998. the simpler version shown here, restricted to formulas in prenex form containing only existential quantifiers, became more popular. Statement Let :(\\\\exists y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n)F(y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n) be a formula of first-order logic with F(y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n) quantifier-free, though it may contain additional free variables. This version of Herbrand's theorem states that the above formula is valid if and only if there exists a finite sequence of terms t_{ij}, possibly in an expansion of the language, with :1 \\\\le i \\\\le k and 1 \\\\le j \\\\le n, such that :F(t_{11},\\\\ldots,t_{1n}) \\\\vee \\\\ldots \\\\vee F(t_{k1},\\\\ldots,t_{kn}) is valid. If it is valid, it is called a Herbrand disjunction for :(\\\\exists y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n)F(y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n). Informally: a formula A in prenex form containing only existential quantifiers is provable (valid) in first-order logic if and only if a disjunction composed of substitution instances of the quantifier-free subformula of A is a tautology (propositionally derivable). The restriction to formulas in prenex form containing only existential quantifiers does not limit the generality of the theorem, because formulas can be converted to prenex form and their universal quantifiers can be removed by Herbrandization. Conversion to prenex form can be avoided, if structural Herbrandization is performed. Herbrandization can be avoided by imposing additional restrictions on the variable dependencies allowed in the Herbrand disjunction. Proof sketch A proof of the non-trivial direction of the theorem can be constructed according to the following steps: # If the formula (\\\\exists y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n)F(y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n) is valid, then by completeness of cut-free sequent calculus, which follows from Gentzen's cut-elimination theorem, there is a cut-free proof of \\\\vdash (\\\\exists y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n)F(y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n). # Starting from above downwards, remove the inferences that introduce existential quantifiers. # Remove contraction- inferences on previously existentially quantified formulas, since the formulas (now with terms substituted for previously quantified variables) might not be identical anymore after the removal of the quantifier inferences. # The removal of contractions accumulates all the relevant substitution instances of F(y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n) in the right side of the sequent, thus resulting in a proof of \\\\vdash F(t_{11},\\\\ldots,t_{1n}), \\\\ldots, F(t_{k1},\\\\ldots,t_{kn}), from which the Herbrand disjunction can be obtained. However, sequent calculus and cut- elimination were not known at the time of Herbrand's theorem, and Herbrand had to prove his theorem in a more complicated way. Generalizations of Herbrand's theorem * Herbrand's theorem has been extended to higher-order logic by using expansion-tree proofs.Dale Miller: A Compact Representation of Proofs. Studia Logica, 46(4), pp. 347--370, 1987. The deep representation of expansion-tree proofs corresponds to a Herbrand disjunction, when restricted to first-order logic. * Herbrand disjunctions and expansion-tree proofs have been extended with a notion of cut. Due to the complexity of cut-elimination, Herbrand disjunctions with cuts can be non-elementarily smaller than a standard Herbrand disjunction. * Herbrand disjunctions have been generalized to Herbrand sequents, allowing Herbrand's theorem to be stated for sequents: \\"a Skolemized sequent is derivable iff it has a Herbrand sequent\\".

The Waziristani dialect is almost identical to the dialect spoken around Urgun (eastern Paktika province) and the Bannuchi dialect of Bannu, and somewhat resembles the dialect spoken by Khattaks in Karak. The dialects of Loya Paktia like Zadrani are also very closely related, except that they are of the harsh northern variety. Waziristani differs significantly in pronunciation and grammar from the standard literary Pashto based on the larger Kandahar, Kabul and Yousafzai dialects. The vowels [a], […ë], [u] and [o] of standard Pashto yield […ë], [o], [i] and [e] respectively, so [pa Çto] becomes [p…ë…ïte] in Waziristani. A special feature of Waziristani is that the phonemes [ É] and [ Ç], along with their voiced counterparts, [ í] and [ ê], have merged into the phonemes […ï] and [ ë], both of which also exist in the nearby Ormuri language of Kaniguram, South Waziristan.Rozi Khan Burki. \\"Dying Languages; Special Focus on Ormuri\\". Originally published in Pakistan Journal of Public Administration; Volume 6. No. 2 in December 2001. Khyber.ORG. The Pashto alphabet has no symbol for their expression and the regular symbols of ⁄ò and ÿ¥ may be used. The standard Pashto word for \\"boy\\", \\"ŸáŸÑ⁄©\\" [hal…ôk], is rarely heard in Waziristani, instead, \\"Ÿà€ê⁄ì⁄©€å\\" [we…ªkai] meaning \\"little one\\" is used. The word \\"l…ôshki\\" [l…ô…ïki] is used instead of the standard \\"ŸÑ⁄ñ\\" [l…ô ê], \\"a little bit\\". The pronoun ŸÖŸà⁄ñ ([mu ê] or [mung]), meaning \\"we\\", is pronounced [mi ë] in Waziristani. Waziristani, like many other obscure Pashto dialects, is almost never written and its speakers may use standard Pashto as a literary language. Waziristani Pashto is spoken by various tribes, and it is also called Maseedwola by the Mahsuds and Dawarwola by the Dawari. There are slight differences in pronunciation, for example, the phonemes [tÕ°s] and [dÕ°z] can become [s] and [z], or even [tÕ° É] and [dÕ° í], depending on the tribe or area the speaker is from.

Background George Garro-Jones was born in Haverfordwest, Wales, on 14 September 1894. He was a 'child of the Manse' as his father was the Congregationalist Minister at Zion's Hill Chapel, Spittal. The Chapel,is still open. His father, Reverend David Garro Jones trained for the ministry at Brecon College and served a number of Congregational churches across Wales. The walk from the Manse in Spittal towards Zion's Hill chapel has views across a deep gorge to Treffgarne Rocks and it is understood this is where the titled name of Lord Trefgarne came from. George Garro-Jones was born in Haverfordwest, Wales, on 14 September 1894. Political career Garro-Jones was private secretary to Sir Hamar Greenwood from 1919 to 1922The Times House of Commons, 1935 while Greenwood was firstly Secretary for Overseas Trade and then Chief Secretary for Ireland. Greenwood was a Liberal Minister in the Coalition Government led by David Lloyd George. This close association led Garro-Jones into standing as a candidate for National Liberals at the 1922 General Election. He was selected to contest Bethnal Green North East, where the sitting Liberal member, also a supporter of the Coalition Government, was retiring. However, Garro-Jones's task of holding the seat was made hard when the National Liberals coalition partners, the Unionists, decided to end the coalition and he found a Unionist intervening against him. To make matters worse, he could not count on the support of the local Liberal Association when an opposition Liberal supporter of H. H. Asquith also entered the contest. As a result, he finished bottom of the poll. After the election the divisions in the Liberal ranks between the supporters of Asquith and Lloyd George was heald. Garro-Jones was chosen as Liberal candidate at the 1923 general election for the Unionist seat of Hackney South. No Liberal candidate had fought here at the previous election, so it was not regarded as a particularly good prospect. The Labour candidate won but Garro-Jones was still able to poll more votes than the sitting member who came third. He only had to wait another year for the opportunity to enter parliament came again. He was again chosen as Liberal candidate for Hackney South. However, this time, there was no Unionist candidate and he was able to take the seat from his Labour opponent. His victory was rare in an election which saw a large number of Liberals lose their seats. He stood down at the 1929 election and shortly afterwards joined the Labour Party. He was elected Labour MP for Aberdeen North at the 1935 general election, holding the seat until 1945. Garro-Jones was raised to the peerage as Baron Trefgarne, of Cleddau in the County of Pembroke, on 21 January 1947. In 1954 he assumed by deed poll the surname of Trefgarne in lieu of his patronymic. He was succeeded by his son David, a Conservative government minister.

Nausea is usually cited as being integral in the rise of American crust punk, a fusion of anarcho-punk and extreme metal styles. Like many anarcho-punk bands of the period, Nausea incorporated both male and female vocalists. They were involved in the New York City Lower East Side squatting community. Their earlier sound with singers Amy Miret and Neil Robinson was in the vein of traditional hardcore punk. After Robinson's departure in 1988, he was replaced by Al Long and the band began to experiment with a darker, heavier sound. Robinson went on to form the bands Jesus Crust and Final Warning, as well as start Tribal War Records. Lyrics and musical style Nausea's apocalyptic lyrics and artwork were influenced by the sociopolitical issues of the day, such as the Reagan Administration, the US-USSR Cold War, and threats of nuclear war with the USSR. Nausea focused on topics such as environmentalism, human extinction, pollution, and animal rights. Nausea progressed from a metallic hardcore punk band to being more of a thrash metal band during its later years with new singer Al Long. The band broke new ground for the emerging crust punk genre,Nausea \\"The Punk Terrorists Anthology Vol. 2: '85 - '88\\" CD - AVERSIONLINE.COM flirting with doom metal, d-beat, noise rock and sludge. Band member John John Jesse describes their music by citing bands such as Discharge, Black Sabbath, Slayer, and Pink Floyd. In their formative years, the founding members were compelled by the political and social messages that the band Crass would use to drive their music; their lyrics reflected their views on feminism, anti-racism, class conflict, and the opposition against war. Later line-up Nausea's final line-up was: John John Jesse (bass), Victor Venom (guitar, ex-Reagan Youth), Amy Miret (vocals), Al Long (vocals), and Roy Mayorga (drums). John John Jesse has gone on to become an artist, as well as joining with members of Choking Victim in the band Morning Glory. Roy Mayorga went on to play with Shelter, Soulfly, Maggott SS (featuring members of Electric Frankenstein and Degeneration), ABLOOM, Stone Sour, filling in for Igor Cavalera with Sepultura in 2006, and drumming for the reunited Amebix.

He maintained regular contact with his family, including his first cousin Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria who moved to Rome in 1939. He was also in regular contact with other royal and princely houses; in 1930 he attended the Rome wedding of the Prince of Piedmont (later King Umberto II of Italy) to Princess Marie-Jos√© of Belgium,Luciano Regolo, La regina incompresa: tutto il racconto della vita di Maria Jos√© di Savoia (Milano: Simonelli, 1997), 414. and in 1935 he attended the Rome wedding of Infante Jaime of Spain.Bego√±a Aranguren, Emanuela de Dampierre, Memorias: Esposa y madre de los Borbones que pudieron reinar en Espa√±a (Madrid: Esfera, 2003), 105. In 1938, as grand prior of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George he arranged the transfer of the remains of King Francis II of the Two Sicilies and of his wife Queen Maria Sophie from Schloss Tegernsee in Bavaria to the Chiesa del Santo Spirito in Rome.Paolo Bardi, Roma Piemontese (1870-1876) (Rome: Bardi, 1970), 123. On 31 May 1943 Georg died at Villa San Francesco. One source says that he had been ill for some time.\\"La morte di Mons. Giorgio di Baviera\\", Osservatore Romano (2 giugno, 1943): 2. Another source says that he died unexpectedly of tuberculosis contracted while working at a hospital.Schad, 37. He is buried in the Campo Santo Teutonico, the German cemetery immediately outside the walls of Vatican City.Weiland, 185, which includes a description of his tombstone. In his will he left money to pay for new bronze doors for St. Peter's Basilica;Bill Pepper Curtis, An Artist and the Pope (New York: Madison Square Press, 1968), 120. these include the \\"Door of the Dead\\" by Giacomo Manz√π and the \\"Door of the Sacraments\\" by Venanzo Crocetti. Greek succession A few writers (e.g. Martha Schad Martha Schad, Kaiserin Elisabeth und ihre T√∂chter (M√ºnchen: Langen M√ºller, 1998)) maintain that after the death of his father in 1930, Georg became the successor to the Greek rights of his great-uncle King Otto of Greece who was deposed in 1862. Georg's uncle Ludwig and his descendants were more senior, but Ludwig had renounced his Greek rights in 1869. However, the Greek Constitution of 1844 required that the successor of King Otto \\"shall profess the Greek Orthodox religion.\\" Charles A. Frazee, The Orthodox Church and Independent Greece, 1821-1852 (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1969): 162. As a Catholic, Georg was thereby excluded from the succession.  Honours and awards  Prince Georg was President of the Royal Automobile Club of Bavaria (K√∂niglich Bayerischer Automobil-Club).Royal Automobile Club Year Book 1912 (London: Royal Automobile Club, 1912), 188.

On June 8, 2008, Rosen was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. On November 14, 2016, Rosen was enshrined as the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award winner for outstanding contributions as a broadcaster by the Hockey Hall of Fame.https://www.nhl.com/news/rangers-broadcaster-sam-rosen-honored-by-hall- of-fame-nod/c-283445552 Rosen's current responsibilities include Rangers telecasts and Sunday NFL games for Fox. He is paired with Joe Micheletti on Rangers broadcasts, and Charles Davis, among others, on national Fox broadcasts. Early history Rosen was born Samuel Rosenblum in Ulm, Germany, to Polish parents Louis Rosenblum (1915‚Äì1987) and the former Gitel Reiner (1915‚Äì2006) of Jewish descent just after World War II. His mother was born in Che≈Çm, Poland. The Rosenblum family moved to Brooklyn, New York, when Rosen was 2 years old. As a New York Yankees fan, Rosen became a fan of their broadcaster Mel Allen. Rosen attended Stuyvesant High School and the City College of New York. At both schools, Rosen played catcher and was the captain of the baseball team. Rosen also played intramural basketball, and was on the track team in high school. Rosen grew up with an older brother, Stephen. Broadcasting career =New York Rangers= From childhood on, Rosen attended numerous New York Rangers games and taped himself doing play by play. Rosen was mentored by veteran Rangers broadcaster Jim Gordon. From 1982 to 1984, he was the studio host on Ranger broadcasts, but was promoted to play- by-play in 1984, succeeding Gordon. Rosen's first partner was ex-Bruin and Ranger star Phil Esposito. Starting in 1986‚Äì87, when Esposito left to become Rangers general manager, Rosen was paired with former Rangers goaltender John Davidson (nicknamed J.D.). The team would last 20 years together until Davidson left for a management position with the St. Louis Blues and later with the Columbus Blue Jackets. Together, Sam and J.D. would be the longest- serving NHL broadcast team. Davidson would eventually return to take over duties as President of the Rangers in May 2019. Beginning with the 2006‚Äì07 NHL season, Rosen partnered with Joe Micheletti, who was New York Islanders TV color analyst with former Rangers radio announcer Howie Rose on Fox Sports Net New York. Rosen's most famous call comes every time the Rangers score a goal on the power play. The call is simply the name of the player, followed by, \\"It's a power play goal!\\", but Rosen uses a unique inflection which has been widely popular among Rangers fans and a staple of any Rangers broadcast. However, his most memorable call was in 1994 when the Rangers won the Stanley Cup for the first time in 54 years: Rosen's call is usually the most often- played of that moment. It is still the highest-rated game in MSG Network history. Rosen was recognized before the Rangers-Islanders game on March 21, 2014, for thirty years of service with the MSG Network. They then did a special called \\"This One Will Last a Lifetime: 30 Years of Sam Rosen\\", which was announced at intermission as a surprise to Rosen by longtime partner and friend John Davidson. Rosen has been told by the Rangers he can continue his position as long as he wishes. He has asked his family to inform him if they feel he is losing his edge due to age but is encouraged that Los Angeles Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully was still considered a top broadcaster when he retired at age 88. =Other broadcasting areas= While still in college Rosen worked in the news department at WINS. Prior to taking the Rangers play-by- play job in 1984, Rosen also served as a studio host for New York Knicks basketball telecasts on MSG. By 1975, he was a full-time sportscaster for United Press International's 1000-station radio network (\\"UPI Audio\\") and was appointed its Sports Director in 1979. He not only worked a daily morning shift beginning with a 5:45 AM sportscast, but also assigned coverage by UPI's stringers at games in every city with a major league sports franchise, and supervised two junior sportscasters. The first hire he had a hand in was of a 20-year old with no previous full-time professional experience, named Keith Olbermann. While at UPI, Rosen traveled to and covered most major sporting events, from the Super Bowl to the World Series. He and Olbermann covered the 1980 Winter Olympics for UPI, and between them reported all the breaking news coverage and produced a half-hour special report, when Yankees catcher and captain Thurman Munson was killed in a plane crash in August, 1979. Even though the UPI position was a full-time responsibility, while he held it Rosen continued his other part-time positions: back-up voice of the Rangers and Knicks on radio and television, Cosmos soccer play-by-play announcer and weekend news anchor on WNEW-AM radio, and spot television boxing assignments for ESPN and USA Network. Olbermann claimed that when he worked for him Rosen held as many as 11 different jobs, while Rosen says he didn't think it was that many but admitted he worked so often that he could easily have forgotten some of them. He left UPI in 1981 when his ESPN workload and compensation became a living wage by itself. Rosen was employed by ESPN from 1979 to 1988, calling a variety of sports for the network including hockey, college football, boxing, table tennis, Australian rules football, college baseball, collegiate wrestling and NASL soccer.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k28rhxg_634 He handled play-by-play for NHL Radio, a partnership between the NHL and Westwood One. He has called the Stanley Cup playoffs on the radio for many years, as well as the 2002 and 2006 Winter Olympic Men's Hockey Tournaments. Rosen has also been a play-by-play announcer for NFL on Fox since 1996. Rosen also called preseason NFL games for the Chicago Bears from 2009 to 2017, when he was replaced by Adam Amin, and previously did this for the New York Giants for several seasons. Rosen's broadcasting partners have included Heath Evans, Kirk Morrison, Ron Pitts, Ray Bentley, Jerry Glanville, Tim Green, Brady Quinn, Matt Millen, Bill Maas, Brian Billick, Tim Ryan, Ronde Barber, Chad Pennington, Daryl Johnston, Cris Carter, John Lynch and Charles Davis. Rosen was also the lead boxing announcer for the MSG Network until 1993. In 1989, he won the Sam Taub Award for excellence in boxing broadcasting journalism.International Boxing Hall of Fame / BWAA Awards . ibhof.com Rosen has also worked for Versus (now the NBC Sports Network) calling games in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. He was the play-by-play announcer for the Stanley Cup Finals on NHL Radio from to . Rosen was also a radio play-by-play announcer for the New York Cosmos. His call \\"It's a Cosmos Goal\\" predated and could be considered as the basis for his trademark power play call.

Located in the city centre, next to Bergen Cathedral, the school has about 850 students, 95 full-time teachers, and 5 administration personnel, including the headmaster, Lise H√•rklau Holsen. The school is thought to have been founded in 1153 by Nicholas Breakspear (later Pope Adrian IV), making the school the second oldest in Norway together with Oslo Cathedral School and Hamar Cathedral School, which were founded the same year, one year after the founding of Trondheim Cathedral School. History Although the earliest written records documenting the school's existence date back to 1288, Bergen Cathedral School is believed to have been founded in 1153 by Nicholas Breakspear, who became Pope Adrian IV in 1154. It was founded as a theological school for the education of priests. Pupils would start attending the school around the age of seven. Until the school reform in 1806, the school was tied to the church. The school building of Bergen Cathedral School, then known as Bergen latinskole, until 1840. The school moved to its present location in 1840. The original building is still in use as the offices for the administration, as well as some classrooms. This building also houses the school library. In 1869 the school's gyms were built, and the same year the school changed its name from \\"Bergen Latinskole\\" to its present \\"Bergen katedralskole\\". The school was independent until 1896, but has been administered by the government since. In 1972, the school was made a regular upper secondary school administered by the county government. Buildings A classrooms only building was built in 1957. Another building, containing science laboratories, computer rooms and a cafeteria was built in 1992. In July 2007, large amounts of mold were discovered in the building from 1840. This led to the building getting closed, resulting in a shortage of teacher offices. The building contains several old classrooms, an auditorium and the school library, which is the oldest library known in Norway. For a while, the school administration considered delaying the start of the term, but this never happened as the teachers and the day-time adult education classes ended up moving into temporary barracks in the schoolyards of Bergen Cathedral School and Tanks Upper Secondary School. In February 2008, it was decided that the building will be renovated at a price of 6 million NOK as a temporary solution that will last until at least 2014. At present, 2016-2017, the original building is closed for renovation and an additional building is being added between it and the classroom wing. The administration, the school library and some classes are temporarily located at the former Tanks videreg√•ende skole. Academics This plaque on the oldest extant school building in Lille √òvregaten states that Ludvig Holberg was a student here (1694 to 1702) Of the mainline courses offered in Norwegian upper secondary schools, only the generalist line, studiespesialisering, is offered by Bergen Cathedral School. The school is the only one in Bergen offering the IB Diploma Programme, from which about forty students graduate per year. In the 2005-2006 school year, the senior year students of Bergen Cathedral School received the third best grades in Western Norway, which was the highest achieving region of Norway. The school has a reputation as a prestigious school, because of its history and high grade requirements.

NICTA (previously known as National ICT Australia Ltd) was Australia's Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Research Centre of Excellence. The term \\"Centre of Excellence\\" is common marketing terminology used by some Australian government organisations for titles of science research groups. NICTA's role was to pursue potentially economically significant ICT related research for the Australian economy. NICTA was structured around groups focused primarily on pure research and the implementation of those ideas within business teams. When its funding ceased, NICTA merged with CSIRO to form a new entity called Data61 on 28 August 2015.  History  In 2002, NICTA won a competitive selection process to be established as Australia's national centre of excellence in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) research, under an Australian Government policy initiative to promote science and innovation called Backing Australia's Ability. The creation of the centre was intended to address a previously identified weakness in long-term strategic ICT research in Australia. NICTA was officially opened on 27 February 2003. The founding members of NICTA were the University of New South Wales, Australian National University, the NSW Government, and the ACT Government. NICTA later acquired other university and government partners. In January 2003, The University of Sydney became a partner. In July 2004, the Victorian Government and The University of Melbourne became partners. In January 2005, the Queensland Government, the University of Queensland, Griffith University, and the Queensland University of Technology became partners. The University of Melbourne and the Victorian Government became members in May 2011. Since foundation NICTA created more than six new companies, collaborated on joint projects with a range of ICT industries, developed a substantial technology and intellectual property portfolio and supplied new expertise to the ICT industry through a NICTA-supported PhD program. Australian Federal Government funding of NICTA was due to expire in June 2016 and there was a concerted effort to secure a merger with CSIRO. This merger was to be with the CSIRO Digital Productivity Flagship and there was the potential for up to 200 redundancies due to funding cuts to both organisations. This \\"merger\\" was realised in due course as the option of last resort as NICTA lost all Federal funding and CSIRO had significant cuts. Duane Zitzner (who replaced Hugh F. Durrant-Whyte as CEO in December 2014 after Durrant-Whyte resigned suddenly due to a disagreement with the NICTA Board) left NICTA at the end of May 2015 in the hope that the merger with CSIRO would be completed by the end of June 2015. As of August 2015 the merger had not been finalizedhttp://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/government-it/200-staff-await- delayed-decision-on-nicta-and-csiro-merger-20150804-girbkx.html and Professor Robert (Bob) Williamson (who also headed NICTA's Machine Learning Research Group) was acting and terminal CEO. NICTA formally merged with CSIRO to form a new entity called Data61 on 28 August 2015. Mr Adrian Turner was appointed to head the merged unit. He reported to a Deputy Chief Executive of CSIRO and had the positional equivalence of a CSIRO Flagship Director. Organisation NICTA research was focused in five scale Research Groups:http://nicta.com.au/research * Software Systems * Mobile Systems * Machine Learning * Computer Vision * Optimisation NICTA focused on potential economic opportunities that related to the use of information and communication technology. NICTA was primarily funded by government and engaged in additional industry partnerships to augment its base funding. These included start-up corporations or other Australian government funds. Four NICTA business teamshttp://nicta.com.au/business were responsible for determining potential commercial or economic outcomes in the following domains for ICT: * Broadband and the Digital Economy * Infrastructure, Transport and Logistics * Security * Environment Additionally the Engineering and Technology Development team helps to productize research outcomes. Locations NICTA had over 700 people (half of whom were graduate students) spread across four cities in Australia at its peak in 2012. This was drastically reduced as first the Victorian state Government and then the Federal Government defunded it. * Australian Technology Park Laboratory and Headquarters, Sydney * Neville Roach Research Laboratory, Kensington, Sydney * Canberra Research Laboratory * Victoria Research Laboratory * Queensland Research Laboratory The Neville Roach Laboratory was moved from its standalone location onto the University of New South Wales main campus in July 2015 as a cost saving measure. In addition, NICTA collaborated with many Australian universities and research organisations, and had a smaller numbers of staff on various non-partner (and non-member) university campuses around the country.  Funding  NICTA was primarily funded by the Australian Government as represented by the Department of Communications and the Australian Research Council. NICTA also received funding from industry and several state governments, and was supported by its member and partner universities.

Originally established in 1931 as a primitive area, region was redesignated as a wilderness in 1964 and expanded to the current size in 1984. The wilderness lies on the west side of the Continental Divide in the Wind River Range and contains Gannett Peak; at it is the tallest mountain in Wyoming. The wilderness is a part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. U.S. Wilderness Areas do not allow motorized or mechanized vehicles, including bicycles. Although camping and fishing are allowed with proper permit, no roads or buildings are constructed and there is also no logging or mining, in compliance with the 1964 Wilderness Act. Wilderness areas within National Forests and Bureau of Land Management areas also allow hunting in season. There are of hiking trails maintained in the wilderness, but with much of the terrain being steep and with many large mountain peaks to climb, many trails provide access climbing routes. Camping is permitted as long as a distance of at least minimum is maintained away from lakes and streams. Due to the high altitude associated with this wilderness, it is not uncommon to have freezing weather, especially at night anytime of the year. In the summer months mosquitos can also be a problem. The largest glaciers in Bridger-Teton National Forest are found in the wilderness. While lower slopes of the mountainsides are dominated by aspen and lodgepole pine, the upper altitudes include lodgepole pine, and numerous species of spruce and fir. Above the timberline at , the plants are delicate and subject to high human impact and care must be used to stay on trails to minimize natural resource impact which can take decades or more for recovery. Infrequent and rare sightings of grizzly bears have been recorded but black bears are much more common. In addition, most of the megafauna originally indigenous to the region still exist in the wilderness including moose, elk, mule deer, wolverine, bighorn sheep and mountain lion. There have been unconfirmed reports of wolf sightings which may be true due to wolf reintroduction commenced in the late 20th century in Yellowstone National Park to the north. Numerous bird species are found including bald eagle, osprey, peregrine falcon and Clark's nutcracker. The streams have long been home to several species of trout, but stocking of the lakes has increased their numbers there along with mountain whitefish and grayling.

He is especially noted for his development of the Sussex village of Bognor into a seaside resort. He was also sometimes called Hotham the Hatter, to mark his original trade.  Early life  Hotham was born the youngest of five children in York in October 1722, but otherwise very little is known about his childhood. Having moved to London to become a hatter's apprentice, in 1743, at the age of 21 he married Frances Atkinson, the daughter of his employer, in the chapel of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea. By 1746 he was trading as a hatter in his own right from premises in Serle Street, Lincoln's Inn, a few years later moving to new premises in The Strand. Hotham's wife Frances died in 1760, and the next year, at the age of 39 he remarried, to Barbara Huddart. At this time he became involved with the East India Company, later working up to having a number of ships under his control ‚Äì records at the British Library show him as 'Principal Managing Owner' of a number of vessels including the East Indiaman York.British Library ‚Äì East India Company Records (Reference IOR) He received his knighthood on 2 April 1769 at the relatively young age of 46.  Rise in society  Using the money he had made in this venture, Hotham began his long association with property development, first buying land and buildings in Merton, South London, including a house for himself known as Merton Grove. This has since been demolished and replaced by Victorian terraced houses including Balfour and Cecil Roads opposite South Wimbledon tube station. The house name was for many years remembered by the name of the Morden Road pub The Grove Hotel, which has in more recent years been acquired by Tesco as a Tesco Metro Supermarket. During his time in Merton, Hotham was appointed a Magistrate, and in 1770 the High Sheriff of Surrey but suffered a further setback in 1777 when Barbara died, leaving him a widower for the second time at age 55. Hotham began to be involved in politics, and at the 1780 general election he played a major part in the campaign to elect Admiral Keppel at Surrey. Hotham himself contested Southwark, and was returned as Member of Parliament for Surrey at the top of the poll. He did not stand at the 1784 general election but stood at the by- election at Southwark two months later in June 1784. He lost the contest very narrowly. In Parliament he voted with the opposition until the fall of the North government and made two speeches. In 1784 he was a member of the St. Alban's Tavern group who tried to bring Fox and Pitt together.  Association with Bognor  Hotham found the climate of the south coast did him the world of good, and decided that he would like to have a house of his own there and accordingly bought a plot of land containing a farmhouse, near the sea. He then set about rebuilding the farmhouse as a comfortable villa which he named Bognor Lodge (this has since been demolished). Following his own experience of the curative nature of the sea air, and the current trend for the gentry to resort to the seaside, his property developing side kicked in, and with an eye to gaining some of the fame and wealth of places like Brighton and Weymouth he set about buying land in the area until eventually he had around in his ownership. Then the building started. He built a number of large terraces of houses around the tiny hamlet, with the express aim of attracting the more well-heeled visitor to his new resort, the ultimate prize being to attract the King away from his favoured resort at Weymouth, or the Prince of Wales from Brighton. Ultimately, this was to be unrealised, although minor members of the Royal Family were attracted to stay in the grand new Dome House, built overlooking Richard's new house and grounds known as Bersted Lodge. Complete with private chapel and clock tower, this house still stands, now known as Hotham Park House. The chapel has gone but the clock tower remains. Sir Richard Hotham died at Bognor in March 1799 and was buried at the parish church of St. Mary Magdalene at South Bersted, where to this day there is an annual wreath laying ceremony at his grave.  Legacy  Following his death the estate was broken up and in the intervening years many of his fine buildings have vanished, although some gems remain, including Hotham Park House, now a private residence in the middle of Hotham Park. The grounds of Aldwick Manor are now a public park known as Hotham Park, and although the name Hothampton did not long survive the man himself, the resort he founded, now known as Bognor Regis, has continued to attract visitors to the present day.

It is situated on Jalan SP Seenivasagam, formerly Clayton Road. Within the same compound are two primary schools, St Michael's I and II. The school has a long history of events such as the annual drama play, which was first held more than sixty years ago and is still continuing. St Michael's Institution is part of the La Sallian worldwide community of schools. The Ipoh City Council has designated the original building block as a historical landmark in Ipoh. It received a five-star rating from the Education Ministry of Perak. History =The modern era= Dato' Bro Vincent Corkery retired as director of the school in 1988, and Chong Suan Ee became both the first Malaysian and who is not a Brother to become the principal of SMI. He was succeeded by K Subramaniam, Teh Chor Aun and Louis Rozario Doss. Under Doss, the school underwent structural improvements, funded primarily by money raised from the annual school plays. Doss retired in 2006, passing the baton to Phoon Chong Chee. Madam Loh Wei Seng took over in 2011 and is the first female principal of SMI. Like Doss, she is a former student of SMI. In the new millennium, enrolment increased to more than 2000 students, putting St Michael's among the 100 largest schools in Malaysia. The large enrolment caused the average number of students in each class to far exceed the government ideal number of Thirty. A typical class in St Michael's has about forty students. Sixth Form can be more packed, with some classes with fifty or more students. In November 2005, construction on the new primary school building began on the school's back field to replace the original wooden building that was falling apart due to termite infestation and posing a danger to students. The new primary school building was completed by the end of 2006 at a cost of RM2.4 million, all of which came from former students and donors. Facilities The school has a school hall, a lecture theatre, a resource centre that is the Marian Library, six science laboratories, two computer laboratories, a Living Skills building, a food court that is famous among schools in Perak, a foyer where the statue Pater Familias is prominently found, a chapel (restored in 2012 from damage caused by water leaking from the roof), and a pavilion for students. A notable feature is the five-star boys toilet. For sports, there are two basketball courts, a volleyball court, four badminton courts, and two football fields. On the second level of the school's main block is the Heritage Room, a small museum that houses many items, documents and antiques that are part of the school's history. Clubs and Societies The school offers a lot of sports, societies and uniform units for students to join. There are currently thirty-three societies, fifteen uniform units, and more than twenty-two sports offered in the institution. Among these sports and games are water polo, golf, badminton, basketball, soccer, football, table tennis, international chess, Chinese chess, rugby, volleyball, softball, handball, squash, and bowling. The societies included is Leo clubs, Interact Club and more. The uniform units include The Michaelian Military Band, Scouts, The Michaelian Chinese Orchestra, Teenagers Cadet, St. John's Ambulance, Michaelian Indian Orchestra, Michaelian Taekwondo Squad, Michaelian Wushu Club and more. The scout troop of St. Michael's Institution is numbered 02 Kinta, which is combined from the former 24th Ipoh and 29th Ipoh Scout Troops. Every year, there are scouts who successfully achieve the prestigious King's Scout Award Award (equivalent to the Eagle Scout Award).  List Of Brother Directors And Principals  St. Michael's Institution is part of the Lasallian Educational Institutions.

The name derives from two Greek stems‚Äîeustheno- \\"strength\\" and -pteron \\"wing\\" and thus \\"strongly developed fins\\".http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Eusthenopteron Early depictions of this animal show it emerging onto land; however, paleontologists now widely agree that it was a strictly aquatic animal.M. Laurin, F. J. Meunier, D. Germain, and M. Lemoine 2007. A microanatomical and histological study of the paired fin skeleton of the Devonian sarcopterygian Eusthenopteron foordi. Journal of Paleontology 81: 143‚Äì153. The genus Eusthenopteron is known from several species that lived during the Late Devonian period, about 385 million years ago. Eusthenopteron was first described by J. F. Whiteaves in 1881, as part of a large collection of fishes from Miguasha, Quebec. Some 2,000 Eusthenopteron specimens have been collected from Miguasha, one of which was the object of intensely detailed study and several papers from the 1940s to the 1990s by paleoichthyologist Erik Jarvik. Description Late Devonian vertebrate speciation, descendants of pelagic lobe-finned fish‚Äîlike Eusthenopteron‚Äîexhibited a sequence of adaptations: * Panderichthys, suited to muddy shallows; * Tiktaalik with limb-like fins that could take it onto land; * Early tetrapods in weed-filled swamps, such as: * Acanthostega which had feet with eight digits, * Ichthyostega with limbs. Descendants also included pelagic lobe-finned fish such as coelacanth species. Anatomically, Eusthenopteron shares many unique features in common with the earliest-known tetrapods. It shares a similar pattern of skull roofing bones with forms such as Ichthyostega and Acanthostega. Eusthenopteron, like other tetrapodomorph fishes, had internal nostrils, (or a choana) which are one of the defining traits of tetrapodomorphs (including tetrapods). It also had labyrinthodont teeth, characterized by infolded enamel, which characterizes all of the earliest known tetrapods as well. Like other fish-like sarcopterygians, Eusthenopteron possessed a two-part cranium, which hinged at mid-length along an intracranial joint. Eusthenopterons notoriety comes from the pattern of its fin endoskeleton, which bears a distinct humerus, ulna, and radius (in the fore-fin) and femur, tibia, and fibula (in the pelvic fin). These appendicular long bones had epiphyseal growth plates that allowed substantial longitudinal growth through endochondral ossification, as in tetrapod long bones.M. Laurin, F. and J. Meunier 2012. A microanatomical and histological study of the fin long bones of the Devonian sarcopterygian Eusthenopteron foordi. Acta Zoologica 93: 88‚Äì97. These six appendicular bones also occur in tetrapods and are a synapomorphy of a large clade of sarcopterygians, possibly Tetrapodomorpha (the humerus and femur are present in all sarcoptergyians). Similarly, its elasmoid scales lack superficial odontodes composed of dentine and enamel; this loss appears to be a synapomorphy with more crownward tetrapodomorphs.Zylberberg, L., Meunier, F. J. and Laurin, M. 2010. A microanatomical and histological study of the postcranial dermal skeleton in the Devonian sarcopterygian Eusthenopteron foordi. Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 55: 459‚Äì470. The earliest-known fossilised evidence of bone marrow has been found in Eusthenopteron, which may be the origin of bone marrow in tetrapods.Sanchez S, Tafforeau P and Ahlberg P E (2014) \\"The humerus of Eusthenopteron: a puzzling organization presaging the establishment of tetrapod limb bone marrow\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 281 (1782): 20140299. Eusthenopteron differs significantly from some later Carboniferous tetrapods in the apparent absence of a recognized larval stage and a definitive metamorphosis.Schultze, H.-P. 1984. Juvenile specimens of Eusthenopteron foordi Whiteaves, 1881 (Osteolepiform rhipidistian, Pisces) from the Late Devonian of Miguasha, Quebec, Canada. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 4: 1-16. In even the smallest known specimen of Eusthenopteron foordi (at 29 mm), the lepidotrichia cover all of the fins, which does not happen until after metamorphosis in genera like Polyodon. This might indicate that Eusthenopteron developed directly, with the hatchling already attaining the general body form of the adult (Cote et al., 2002).

Slice was reintroduced in the United States and Canada by New Slice Ventures LLC, who acquired the trademark rights in those countries. Slice was also reintroduced in India by PepsiCo in 2008 as a Mango-flavoured fruit drink and currently advertised as Tropicana Slice.  History  The original Lemon Lime Slice was introduced in 1984 as a replacement for Teem, and a competitor to Sprite and 7-Up. Its distinguishing characteristic at the time was that it contained 10% fruit juice. A diet version was introduced in 1985. The line was expanded in 1986 with Mandarin Orange, Apple, and Cherry Cola flavors, including diet versions of each. Advertisements during this era featured the slogan \\"We got the juice\\". Slice was a big success upon release, inspiring other juice-infused drinks based on already existing juice brands, such as Coca-Cola's Minute Maid orange soda and Cadbury Schweppes's Sunkist. By May 1987, Slice held 3.2 percent of the soft drink market. One year later, it had fallen to 2.1 percent and was below 2 percent in June 1988. By 1988, the juice content had been reduced (packaging now said \\"with fruit juices\\" instead of \\"10% fruit juices\\"), the slogan was changed to \\"Either you got it or you don't\\", and the Apple and Cherry Cola flavors had been discontinued. By 1990, the packaging had been redesigned, and the juice content dropped entirely. The line of flavors was also expanded again, this time with flavors more similar to competitors like Crush, including Strawberry, Pineapple, Fruit Punch, and Grape. Slice advertising in the early 1990s featured Fido Dido, a character associated with US competitor 7-Up in international markets where PepsiCo has the rights to the latter brand. Lemon Lime Slice used the slogan \\"Clearly the One\\" during this era. The first two can and bottle designs featured a solid color related to the flavor of the drink. These were replaced in 1994 with black cans that featured colorful bursts related to the flavor of the drink, along with slicker graphics. More new flavors were made available during this era, including Dr Slice, a competitor to Dr Pepper. In 1997, the cans became blue with color- coordinated swirls. The Mandarin Orange flavor was reformulated around this time as an \\"Orange Citrus\\" flavor with the new slogan, \\"It's orange, only twisted.\\" It would subsequently be reformulated again as just Orange Slice. In the summer of 2000, lemon-lime Slice was replaced in most markets by Sierra Mist, which became a national brand in 2003. The rest of the Slice line was replaced in most markets by Tropicana Twister Soda in the summer of 2005. In early 2006, Pepsi resurrected the Slice name for a new line of diet soda called Slice ONE. Marketed exclusively at Wal-Mart stores, Slice ONE was available in orange, grape and berry flavors, all sweetened with Splenda. As of 2009, Slice (orange, diet orange, grape, strawberry and peach flavors) was available solely from Wal-Mart Stores. Slice was launched in India in 1993 as a mango flavored drink and quickly went on to become a leading player in the category. In India, 'Slice Mango' is promoted by Bollywood actress Katrina Kaif. Slice mango is also available in Pakistan. Slice was discontinued by PepsiCo at an unknown date in the United States between the late 2000s to early or mid 2010s, no longer being on PepsiCo‚Äôs ‚ÄúProduct Locator‚Äù website. By 2018, New Slice Ventures LLC had acquired the Slice trademark portfolio in the United States and Canada, and was working with Revolution Brands, Dormitus Brands and Spiral Sun Ventures, to re-launch a lower-sugar, lower-calorie beverage sweetened only with USDA-certified organic fruit juice.

It depicts the story on three panels: The left one is about the first encounter of V√§in√§m√∂inen and Aino in the forest. The right one depicts mournful Aino weeping on the shore and listening to the call of the maids of Vellamo who are playing in the water. The central panel depicts fishing V√§in√§m√∂inen having thrown away a small fish, now turning out to be Aino, who laughs at him and vanishes forever. Aino is a figure in the Finnish national epic Kalevala. Description It relates that she was the beautiful sister of Joukahainen. Her brother, having lost a singing contest to the storied V√§in√§m√∂inen, promised Aino's \\"hands and feet\\" in marriage if V√§in√§m√∂inen would save him from drowning in the swamp into which Joukahainen had been thrown. Aino's mother was pleased at the idea of marrying her daughter to such a famous and well born person, but Aino did not want to marry such an old man. Rather than submit to this fate, Aino drowned herself (or ended up as a nix). However, she returned to taunt the grieving V√§in√§m√∂inen as a perch. The name Aino, meaning \\"the only one\\", was invented by Elias L√∂nnrot who composed the Kalevala. In the original poems she was mentioned as \\"the only daughter\\" or \\"the only sister\\" (aino tytt√∂nen, aino sisko).  National romanticism  During the national romantic period at the end of the 19th century the mythological name Aino was adopted as a Christian name by Fennoman activists. Among the first to be named so were Aino J√§rnefelt (Aino Sibelius), born 1871 and Aino Krohn (the later Aino Kallas), born 1878. According to the Finnish Population Register Centre, over 60,000 women have been given the name. It was especially popular in the early 20th century, and the most common first name for women in the 1920s. It has returned to favor in the 21st century; it was the most popular name for girls in Finland in 2006 and 2007.

Edible thickeners are commonly used to thicken sauces, soups, and puddings without altering their taste; thickeners are also used in paints, inks, explosives, and cosmetics. Thickeners may also improve the suspension of other ingredients or emulsions which increases the stability of the product. Thickening agents are often regulated as food additives and as cosmetics and personal hygiene product ingredients. Some thickening agents are gelling agents (gellants), forming a gel, dissolving in the liquid phase as a colloid mixture that forms a weakly cohesive internal structure. Others act as mechanical thixotropic additives with discrete particles adhering or interlocking to resist strain. Thickening agents can also be used when a medical condition such as dysphagia causes difficulty in swallowing. Thickened liquids play a vital role in reducing risk of aspiration for dysphagia patients. Types Food thickeners frequently are based on either polysaccharides (starches, vegetable gums, and pectin), or proteins. A flavorless powdered starch used for this purpose is a fecula (from the Latin faecula, diminutive of faex, \\"dregs\\"). This category includes starches as arrowroot, cornstarch, katakuri starch, potato starch, sago, wheat flour, almond flour, tapioca and their starch derivatives. Microbial and Vegetable gums used as food thickeners include alginin, guar gum, locust bean gum, and xanthan gum. Proteins used as food thickeners include collagen, egg whites, and gelatin. Sugar polymers include agar, carboxymethyl cellulose, pectin and carrageenan. Other thickening agents act on the proteins already present in a food. One example is sodium pyrophosphate, which acts on casein in milk during the preparation of instant pudding. Different thickeners may be more or less suitable in a given application, due to differences in taste, clarity, and their responses to chemical and physical conditions. For example, for acidic foods, arrowroot is a better choice than cornstarch, which loses thickening potency in acidic mixtures. At (acidic) pH levels below 4.5, guar gum has sharply reduced aqueous solubility, thus also reducing its thickening capability. If the food is to be frozen, tapioca or arrowroot are preferable over cornstarch, which becomes spongy when frozen. Many other food ingredients are used as thickeners, usually in the final stages of preparation of specific foods. These thickeners have a flavor and are not markedly stable, thus are not suitable for general use. However, they are very convenient and effective, and hence are widely used. Functional flours are produced from specific cereal variety (wheat, maize, rice or other) conjugated to specific heat treatment able to increase stability, consistency and general functionalities. These functional flours are resistant to industrial stresses such as acidic pH, sterilisation, freeze conditions, and can help food industries to formulate with natural ingredients. For the final consumer, these ingredients are more accepted because they are shown as \\"flour\\" in the ingredient list. Flour is often used for thickening gravies, gumbos, and stews. It must be cooked in thoroughly to avoid the taste of uncooked flour. Roux, a mixture of flour and fat (usually butter) cooked into a paste, is used for gravies, sauces and stews. Cereal grains (oatmeal, couscous, farina, etc.) are used to thicken soups. Yogurt is popular in Eastern Europe and Middle East for thickening soups. Soups can also be thickened by adding grated starchy vegetables before cooking, though these will add their own flavour. Tomato puree also adds thickness as well as flavour. Egg yolks are a traditional sauce thickener in professional cooking; they have rich flavor and offer a velvety smooth texture but achieve the desired thickening effect only in a narrow temperature range. Overheating easily ruins such a sauce, which can make egg yolk difficult to use as a thickener for amateur cooks. Other thickeners used by cooks are nuts (including rehan) or glaces made of meat or fish. Many thickening agents require extra care in cooking. Some starches lose their thickening quality when cooked for too long or at too high a temperature; on the other hand, cooking starches too short or not hot enough might lead to an unpleasant starchy taste or cause water to seep out of the finished product after cooling. Also, higher viscosity causes foods to burn more easily during cooking. As an alternative to adding more thickener, recipes may call for reduction of the food's water content by lengthy simmering. When cooking, it is generally better to add thickener cautiously; if over-thickened, more water may be added but loss of flavour and texture may result. Food thickening can be important for people facing medical issues with chewing or swallowing, as foods with a thicker consistency can reduce the chances of choking, or of inhalation of liquids or food particles, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia. =Gelling agents= Gelling agents are food additives used to thicken and stabilize various foods, like jellies, desserts and candies. The agents provide the foods with texture through formation of a gel. Some stabilizers and thickening agents are gelling agents. Typical gelling agents include natural gums, starches, pectins, agar-agar and gelatin. Often they are based on polysaccharides or proteins. Examples are: * Alginic acid (E400), sodium alginate (E401), potassium alginate (E402), ammonium alginate (E403), calcium alginate (E404) - polysaccharides from brown algae * Agar (E406, a polysaccharide obtained from red algae) * Carrageenan (E407, a polysaccharide obtained from red seaweeds) * Locust bean gum (E410, a natural gum polysaccharide from the seeds of the carob tree) * Pectin (E440, a polysaccharide obtained from apple or citrus-fruit) * Gelatin (E441, made by partial hydrolysis of animal collagen) Commercial jellies used in East Asian cuisines include the glucomannan polysaccharide gum used to make \\"lychee cups\\" from the konjac plants, and aiyu or ice jelly from the Ficus pumila climbing fig plant. Agar-agar produces a very clear gel with light residual taste. Gelatin sheets disperse easily with no residual taste, but powdered form may have some taste. Kappa carragreenan may include potassium chloride to improve the gelling process and produces a clear product with very little aftertaste. Iota carrageenan contains sodium chloride which improves gel formation. Sodium alginate produces a medium viscosity gel but may have some aftertaste. HM Pectin is one of the most widely used gelling agents in food processing. It reacts with some sugars and acids and sometimes includes minerals to improve gelling process. LM Pectin reacts with calcium, and is used for the preparation of low sugar jams. Mechanical and thixotropic agents Fumed silica and similar products form stiff microscopic chains or fibers which interlock or agglomerate into a mass, holding the associated liquid by surface tension, but which can separate or slide when sufficient force is applied. This causes the thixotropic or shear-thinning property (also frequently exhibited by gels), where the viscosity is non-Newtonian and becomes lower as the shearing force or time increases; their usefulness is primarily that the resulting increase in viscosity is large compared to the quantity of silica added. Fumed silica is generally accepted as safe as a food additive and is frequently used in cosmetics. Additives such as precipitated silica, fine talc, or chalk also meet the definition of thickening agent in that they increase viscosity and body while not affecting the target property of a mixture. Cosmetics Thickening agents used in cosmetics or personal hygiene products include viscous liquids such as polyethylene glycol, synthetic polymers such as carbomer (a trade name for polyacrylic acid) and vegetable gums. Some thickening agents may also function as stabilizers when they are used to maintain the stability of an emulsion. Some emollients, such as petroleum jelly and various waxes may also function as thickening agents in an emulsion. Paint and printing thickeners One of the main use of thickeners is in the paint and printing industries, which depend heavily on rheology modifiers, to prevent pigments settling to the bottom of the can, yielding inconsistent results. Water based formulas would be nearly impossible with the exception of India ink and the few other water-soluble pigments, but these would have very little coverage and at best would stain wood slightly. All modern paints and inks will have some pigment added at the factory for opacity and to control the specularity of the finish, from matte to high gloss, dependent on thickener used, but more so on the size of the particles added as opacity modifier. Particle sizes of 1 ¬µm and below will be the limit of high gloss, probably confined to luxury automotive coatings, and about 100 ¬µm particulates will make a bumpy surface on the microscopic scale, which scatters light and makes the surface appear matte. Rheology modifiers in common use: * Polyurethanes, acrylic polymers, latex, styrene/butadiene, * PVA - polyvinyl alcohol, not polyvinylacetate which is used in adhesives such as wood glue. PVA monomers are dispersed in the paint or ink liquid at an early stage in the mix, as it does not affect rheology unless the pH is low. Boric acid is usually used to initiate polymerization after the pigment is added (the pigment \\"grind\\" stage) and dispersed, the mixture is thickened while stirring to maintain homogeneous consistency. Often this stage is problematic since air is entrained by all but the lowest shear impellers, which are inadequate for this purpose, instead antifoam additives are used to control air bubbles, which continue to be a benefit during paint application. Air entrainment during mixing is not unique to PVA‚Äîin fact hardly a formula for paint exists that doesn't at least require some care in mixing. * Clays - attapulgite which also disperses suspensions, bentonite (both flocculating and non-flocculating), and other montmorillonite clays. Usually clays, when dry, exist as a very fine powder, facilitating dispersion and compatibility with other ingredients. Clays generally make matte surfaces, in spite of their fine particulate nature. Not only paints and inks, but other industries such as pharmaceutical, construction, and cosmetics, especially hair styling aids and facial detoxifying masks increasingly favor bentonite and attapulgite clays over other rheology modifiers, dispersion aids, opacifying fillers, antifoam, and numerous niche uses which exploit the numerous inherent qualities which have drawn artisans to this material. Clays are sustainably sourced and do not involve any egregious environmental damage, which were among the cheapest bulk materials until recently, when the pricing went up steadily, following the upsurge in its use pattern. * Cellulosics - CMC, HMC, HPMC, and others, all are chemically substituted cellulose macromolecules. The hydroxyl groups are what gets substituted by other functional groups, such as methoxy or propyl. The amount of substitution and molecular weight determine viscosity of the solution, assuming concentration stays the same; adding more also increases viscosity. * Sulfonates - Sodium or calcium salts, good water retention, versatile, and highly efficient. * Gums - guar, xanthan, cellulose, locust bean, and acacia are the main ones. * Saccharides - carrageenan, pullulan, konjac, and alginate, sometimes called hydrocolloids, these thickeners are extremely versatile and specific in function‚Äîeach has a series of grades or types which behave differently, for example kappa carrageenan will form strong gels (potassium activated) but iota carrageenan will not form gels and only thickens. * Proteins - Casein, collagen, and sometimes albumin. * Modified castor oil - much like cellulose, castor oil has hydroxyl groups, unlike other oils which at most have double bonds, which castor oil also has, but most substitutions occur at the hydroxyl moieties, allowing exotic derivatives with myriad properties. The most recent advances in rheology modifiers have been in this category. The BASF corporation has a new line based on castor oil derivatives, for example. * Organosilicones - Silicone resins, dimethicones, and modified silicones simplify formulation somewhat, a borrowing from cosmetics. All of the above rheology modifiers are used in the 0.2% to 2.0% range Petrochemistry In petrochemistry, gelling agents, also called solidifiers, are chemicals capable of reacting with oil spills and forming rubber-like solids. The gelled coagulated oil then can be removed from the water surface by skimming, suction devices, or nets. Calm or only moderately rough sea is required. Explosives and incendiaries Various materials are used to convert liquid explosives to a gel form. Nitrocellulose and other nitro esters are often used. Other possibilities include nitrated guar gum. Many fuels used in incendiary devices require thickening for increased performance. Aluminium salts of fatty acids are frequently used. Some formulations (e.g. Napalm-B) use polymeric thickeners, namely polystyrene. Hydroxyl aluminium bis(2-ethylhexanoate) is also used. Thickened pyrophoric agent, a pyrophoric replacement of napalm, is a triethylaluminium thickened with polyisobutylene.

It was an improvement of the Panzerb√ºchse 38 (PzB 38) rifle. Development =PzB 38= German anti-tank rifles originated back in 1917 with the Mauser 1918 T-Gewehr, the world's first anti-tank rifle. It was created in response to the appearance of the first British tanks on the Western Front. That single shot manually operated rifle enjoyed moderate success; approximately 15,800 rifles were built. German development resumed in the late 1930s. In an effort to provide infantry with a man-portable lightweight anti-tank rifle, Dipl.-Ing. (certified engineer) B. Brauer at Gustloff Werke in Suhl designed the Panzerb√ºchse 38 (PzB 38). It was a manually loaded single-shot weapon with a recoiling barrel. When fired, the barrel recoiled about , which opened the breech and ejected the spent cartridge casing. The breech block was then arrested in the rear position, remaining opened for the gunner to manually insert a new cartridge. The gunner then released the cocked breech with a lever at the grip. The breech and barrel would then move forward again and the trigger was cocked in preparation to fire. This rather complicated mechanism was reportedly prone to jamming as the system got dirty in field use. Although manufactured with pressed steel parts that were spot-welded, because of the complicated vertical breech block mechanism it was difficult to manufacture and only a small number of 1,408 PzB 38 rifles were built in 1939 and 1940 at the Gustloff Werke plant; 62 of these weapons were used by German troops in the invasion of Poland in 1939. The rifle was long - folded for transport - and weighed . It used a specifically designed cartridge with a standard caliber of 7.9 mm, but a very large 94 mm long case (nominal 7.92√ó94mm). also known as the \\"7.92 x 94 Patronen\\". Eastern Front. =PzB 39= The next development, onto which production was immediately switched, was the Panzerb√ºchse 39 (PzB 39), an improvement made by Gustloff on their PzB 38. It also used a vertical breech block mechanism and the same cartridge as the PzB 38. It retained the barrel of the PzB 38 and had an only slightly increased overall length of ; weight was reduced to . Performance was basically the same as that of the PzB 38. To increase the practical rate of fire, two cases each containing 10 rounds could be attached to the sides of the weapon near the breech - these were not magazines feeding the weapon, but merely put the cartridges closer to hand for the gunner. 568 PzB 39 were used by the German army in the invasion of Poland; two years later, at the beginning of the war against the USSR, 25,298 PzB 39 were in use by German troops. Total production from March 1940 to November 1941, when production ceased, was 39,232 rifles. The PzB 39 remained in use until 1944, by which time it had become hopelessly inadequate against all but the lightest armored vehicles. Variants The Granatb√ºchse 39 grenade launcher version of the PzB 39. The short barrel and muzzle-mounted grenade launcher cup distinguish this variant from the PzB 39. Starting in 1942, remaining PzB 39 rifles were rebuilt with a shortened barrel (590 mm) and an affixed Schiessbecher (\\"firing cup\\") attachment threaded to the barrel and used to launch standard rifle grenades. The cup was the standard type used with the ubiquitous Kar 98k infantry rifle and the ammunition was also interchangeable; there were three types of grenades: an anti-personnel grenade, a light anti-tank grenade and a large-diameter anti- tank grenade. The grenades were propelled by a special cartridge with a wood bullet. The rifle was also outfitted with a special sighting arrangement for firing up to 150 m and the wooden forend was removed. These converted rifles received the designation Granatb√ºchse Modell 39 (GrB 39) and remained in use until the end of the war.

They were originally known as \\"running sheds\\", \\"engine sheds\\" or, for short, just sheds. Facilities are provided for refuelling and replenishing water, lubricating oil and grease and, for steam engines, disposal of the ash. There are often workshops for day to day repairs and maintenance, although locomotive building and major overhauls are usually carried out in the locomotive works. (Note: In American English, the term depot is used to refer to passenger stations or goods (freight) facilities and not to vehicle maintenance facilities.) MPDs in Britain are now often known as traction maintenance depots (TMDs). German practice The equivalent of such depots in German-speaking countries is the Bahnbetriebswerk or Bw which has similar functions, with major repairs and overhauls being carried out at Ausbesserungswerke. The number of these reduced drastically on the changeover from steam to diesel and electric traction and most modern Bw in Germany are specialised depots, often responsible for a single rail class. Engine sheds in the steam era Engine sheds could be found in many towns and cities, as well as in rural locations. They were built by the railway companies to provide accommodation for their locomotives that provided their local train services. Each engine shed would have an allocation of locomotives that would reflect the duties carried out by that depot. Most depots had a mixture of passenger, freight and shunting locomotives but some, such as Mexborough, had predominantly freight locomotives reflecting the industrial nature of that area in South Yorkshire. Others, such as Kings Cross engine shed in London, predominantly provided locomotives for passenger workings. Nearly all depots at this time had a number of shunting locomotives. Normally 0-4-0T or 0-6-0T tank engines, these would be allocated to shunt turns and could be found in goods yards, carriage sidings, goods depots and docks. Many large rail connected industrial sites also had engine sheds, primarily using shunting locomotives. =Design= Each railway company had its own architectural design of engine shed, but there were three basic designs of shed: * Roundhouse - where the tracks would radiate from a turntable; * Straight - a number of tracks that would be accessible from either end; * Dead End - a number of sidings accessible from one end only. The turntables for straight and dead end sheds were generally outside. Those in roundhouses could be inside, such as those at York in the UK, or outside, such as that at the East Broad Top Railroad & Coal Company in Rockhill, Pennsylvania, USA. Worcester Locomotive Depot geograph-2090914.jpgWorcester Locomotive Depot (UK) in April 1959 EBT Roundhouse 1.jpgRoundhouse with outdoor turntable in Pennsylvania, USA =Activity= There were six primary activities that took place at the sheds. Ash removal When a steam engine arrived on shed, it would drop its fire and the ash that had built up would be removed. Disposal of the ash was a filthy job and carried out at quiet times, although some bigger depots had facilities for disposing of ash more efficiently. Study of photographs from the steam era show it was not uncommon for piles of ash to be scattered around the depot site. Boiler washout After completing their last duty and arriving on shed, locomotives would have a regular boiler washout to remove scale, improve efficiency and protect safety. Coaling Locomotives generally ran on coal. Initially this job was done by hand and many depots had significant coal stacks on site. These would be neatly constructed with the outer walls constructed of dry blocks much in the style of a dry stone wall with smaller pieces behind these. As technology advanced and the bigger sheds got busier, this process became mechanised and huge coaling towers above the neighbourhoods indicated where the engine shed was. The sheds were not clean places to work. The large east London depot of Stratford had an engineman‚Äôs dormitory and its occupants would ‚Äúwake up with a layer of coal dust covering them and the bed‚Äù. 5690 LEANDER at Carnforth.jpgLMS 4-6-0 5690 LEANDER at Carnforth in the UK under the mechanical coaling tower. Watering Another key requirement of the steam engine is a supply of water which is carried in the tenders or tanks of the engines. In Australia, water was also carried in water gins (a water tank mounted on a wagon) due to longer distances covered and scarcer water resources. In depots where the limescale content of water was high (known in some areas as ‚ÄòHard Water), water softening plants were introduced. At Norwich engine shed in the UK, the sludge was discharged into a tank and emptied every three years or so with the sludge being dumped into the sea at Lowestoft. Inlandsbanan Water crane.jpg Inlandsbanan Water crane - similar cranes were found at engine sheds as well as stations. Turning Tender locomotives required turning so they were facing the right way before their next duty. In the early days, these were typically around 45 feet long. As the technology improved and engines got bigger, then the turntables got longer. In order to turn a locomotive the engine had to be balanced quite precisely on the turntable and it could then be literally pushed around. Some turntables could be powered by fixing the vacuum brake of the engine to the turntable and using that to turn the engine. Later turntables were electrically operated. Many diesel locomotives in the UK have a cab at each end removing the need for the turntables. However, in Australia and America, there are a number of single ended locomotives and turntables are still in use.

Repairs Engine sheds would carry out basic maintenance and the bigger sheds would carry out more complex repairs. Locomotives that required further repair were sent to the company‚Äôs locomotive works. Withdrawn locomotives could often be found at some depots before their final trips to the scrapyard. =Sub-shed= In the UK, the general practice is that one shed would have a number of smaller sub-sheds where there were fewer facilities. When engines allocated to sub-sheds required repairs, they were often exchanged for a similar engine or perhaps just visiting the main depot on a Sunday when traffic levels were considerably lower. In terms of locomotive allocation, it seems to have been the practice that for some railways locomotives were all allocated to the main shed but in others each shed had its specific allocation of locomotives. A list of the British sub- sheds can be found here. =Staff= The drivers and fireman were the visible face of the engine shed and, as such, certain sheds had reputations for clean locomotives thanks to the dedication of those men. Many companies allocated a specific main line locomotive to a crew and they would usually take a personal interest in the cleanliness of their engine; some companies offered a prize to the crew of the best kept engine. Many drivers would spend their own time on improving their knowledge and sharing best practice with younger drivers. The footplate staff (as drivers and fireman were known) were unionised from the 19th century and in the UK were generally in the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants (later ASLEF) whilst other shed staff tended to be in the National Union of Railwaymen. Many engine shed workers put up with very poor conditions for many years. In the 1950s and 1960s, the rise of manufacturing industry saw many staff leaving the railway for better working conditions (and pay) and many railways started to modernise as a result. Engine sheds in the modern era An evening view of Kollam Junction railway station and Kollam MEMU Shed The maintenance of the new diesel locomotives in filthy steam sheds soon proved difficult and, although some old sheds survived, many new diesel depots were built on new sites or on the sites of the old steam sheds. The major problem was the disposal of oil, which initially was left lying around causing pollution and safety issues. The new depots were equipped to deal with diesel fuel and the ability to access the underside, as well as upper body work, was improved. The tasks were not that much different in that diesel locomotives were fuelled rather than coaled, although they did require water as early diesels were equipped with steam generators for train heating purposes. Since privatisation in the UK, some depots are now operated by the train builders who maintain the trains under contract with train operators. Stabling and fuelling points Around railway networks, there are locations just used for the coaling/fuelling of locomotives and the stabling of stock, either overnight or between duties. These are generally not regarded as engine sheds.

It is affiliated with, and in 1947 was a founding member of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students. History The young English evangelist, Howard Guinness, toured Australia in 1930 to encourage university students in evangelism. He helped form campus student groups starting in Sydney,UNSW Christian Union website , accessed 28 February 2009 then Melbourne, Brisbane and Hobart, including Sydney University Evangelical Union (SUEU) and Melbourne University Christian Union (MUCU - originally the Melbourne University Evangelical Union), which celebrated their 75th anniversaries in 2005. Guinness returned in 1933-1934 and founded groups in Perth and Adelaide.AFES website, accessed 28 February 2009 These groups, led by the SUEU and the MUCU, joined together to form a network in 1936 as the Australian Intervarsity Fellowship or IVF, which later changed its name to the AFES in 1973. It had over 2000 members by 1959 and today has groups in over 50 campuses across the country in every state and territory, and employs over 100 staffworkers who look after the students on their various campuses. In 2005, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the first student groups in Australia, AFES ran a \\"Year of Tertiary Evangelism\\" involving coordinated events on university campuses throughout the country and the printing of 40000 copies of Mark's Gospel to be freely distributed throughout the year.Australian Fellowship of Evangelical Students, \\"For Christ's Sake: Nailing Jesus through the Gospel of Mark\\", The Bible Society in Australia Inc., 2004, The theme of the year was \\"For Christ's Sake\\", a phrase normally used in swearing, though used here to promote the Christian message itself. Besides the events on specific university campuses, the AFES ran various evangelistic rallies with many Christian groups from different universities attending. Muriel Porter suggests that AFES is the \\"predominant student Christian organization across Australian universities,\\" since the demise of the Student Christian Movement and the decline of diocesan-funded university chaplaincies. Activities AFES groups run a variety of activities, such as regular public Bible talks, smaller Bible studies, prayer groups, mid-year conferences and evangelistic outreach events. These activities are organised and run by both staff and students. Each year in December, the AFES runs a National Training Event (NTE). This consists of a four- to five-day training conference, followed by several days of mission. The most recent NTE conference was hosted at Exhibition Park in CanberraFrom the AFES website (EPIC), and was attended by up to 1400 students from around Australia. The mission aspect of the NTE takes place in conjunction with churches around Australia. Staff The national director of AFES is Richard Chin.AFES profile of Richard Chin He was preceded by Kerry Nagel. Staff are employed through AFES for the particular university campuses. Each staff member must raise his or her own financial support, which is sent to AFES by supporters and paid out to staff as a salary. (Many supporters of AFES staff are former AFES students who are now in paid employment.) Staff usually are Long Term Pastors (LTPs) and Trainees, who usually work for a two-year \\"traineeship\\". After completing the traineeship, they may move to theological education and a more senior position. Publications AFES publishes a biannual magazine called Salt. Criticism Melbourne based journalist Muriel Porter has argued that AFES is an \\"outreach of Sydney Diocese in all but name\\" and \\"a Trojan horse for Sydney Anglican teaching around the country\\" though she admits that she is \\"obviously not able to report on Sydney objectively and even-handedly.\\" Porter suggests that AFES is also spreading \\"Sydney-style opposition to women in church leadership\\" in the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne and the Churches of Christ. She notes that students converted by AFES are bringing their \\"newly-acquired conservative stance into parish life.\\" See also *Campus Bible Study *Christian Union *International Fellowship of Evangelical Students *International student ministry *Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship *Ichthys References External links *AFES website *AFES MP3 Library *CTindex listing Category:Protestantism in Australia Category:Student societies in Australia Category:Evangelical parachurch organizations Category:Christian organizations established in 1930 Category:Student organizations established in 1930 Category:Evangelical organizations established in the 20th century Category:Student religious organisations in Australia Category:1930 establishments in Australia ","title":"Australian Fellowship of Evangelical Students"},{"id":"2518477","title":"Don't Give Me Names"},{"id":"2518492","text":"Broodstock, or broodfish, are a group of mature individuals used in aquaculture for breeding purposes. Broodstock can be a population of animals maintained in captivity as a source of replacement for, or enhancement of, seed and fry numbers.Waples, R.S., and C. Do. 1994. Genetic risk associated with supplementation of Pacific salmonids: Captive broodstock programs. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Science,51(1), 310‚Äì329. These are generally kept in ponds or tanks in which environmental conditions such as photoperiod, temperature and pH are controlled. Such populations often undergo conditioning to ensure maximum fry output. Broodstock can also be sourced from wild populations where they are harvested and held in maturation tanks before their seed is collected for grow-out to market sizeFast, A. W. (1994). Effects of broodstock size and source on ovarian maturation and spawning on Penaeus monodon Fabricius from the Gulf of Thailand. Journal of the World Aquaculture Society, 25(1), 41‚Äì49. or the juveniles returned to the sea to supplement natural populations. This method, however, is subject to environmental conditions and can be unreliable seasonally, or annually. Broodstock management can improve seed quality and number through enhanced gonadal development and fecundity.Izquierdo, M. S., Fernandez-Palacios, H. And Tacon, A. G. J. (2001). Effect of broodstock nutrition on reproductive performance of fish. Aquaculture, 197, 25‚Äì42.  Management  Broodstock management involves manipulating environmental factors surrounding the broodstock to ensure maximum survival, enhance gonadal development and increase fecundity. Such conditioning is necessary to ensure the sustainability of aquaculture production,Mylonas, C. C., Fostier, A. And Zanuy, S. (2010). Broodstock management and hormonal manipulations of fish reproduction. General and Comparative Endocrinology, 165(3), 516‚Äì534. and to increase the number and quality of eggs produced and control the timing of maturation and spawning.Bromage, N., Jones, J., Randall, C., Thrush, M., Davies, B., Springate, J., Duston, J. and Barker, G., (1992), Broodstock management, fecundity, egg quality and the timing of egg production in the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).Aquaculture, 100, 14. Management of the technologies for gamete production in captivity is one of the essential step for aquaculture that would ensure the growth to this sector. Unfortunately, most fish when reared in captivity condition, exhibit some degree of reproduction dysfunction. Many species of captive fish are able to reach reproduction maturity in aquaculture conditions and gonadal growth occurs normally. However, some of female species often fail final oocyte maturation stage.Yousefian, M., Mousavi, S. E.(2011). The mechanism of reproduction and hormonal function in finfish species: A review. Scientific Research and Essays, 6(17), 3561-3570. Hormonal manipulation and acceleration of final oocyte maturation due to the economics of broodstock management is important. For instance, in Salmoniformes, the need to collect the eggs by stripping is a serious limitation, while the time of ovulation must be predicted with accuracy, as over-ripening may take place in minutes or hours after ovulationMousavi, S. E. (2013). Hormonal induction and synchronization of ovulation in endangered Caspian brown trout (Salmo trutta caspius Kessler, 1877) and its effect on egg quality.Journal of current research in science, 1(4), 192-198. Therefore, control of broodstock reproductive is essential for the sustainability of commercial aquaculture productionYousefian, M., Mousavi, S. E.(2011). A review of the control of reproduction and hormonal manipulations in finfish species. African Journal of Agricultural Research, 6(7), 1643-1650. Choosing species to use requires consideration of the biology of the species. This includes their size at maturity, method of reproduction, feeding behaviour and ability to tolerate adverse conditionsDemoulin, F. (1999). Guidelines for broodstock and hatchery management; Support for technical services. Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, Bangkok. Farms also consider whether they grow their own broodstock or obtain them from natural populations. Where natural populations are excluded, the farm can be considered a self-sustaining unit independent of external genetic influence.Hussain, M. G. and Mazid, M. A. (1999). Broodstock management status and some suggestions to control negative selection and inbreeding in hatchery stocks in Bangladesh. The ICLARM Quarterly, 22(4), 24‚Äì27. Pond-reared broodstocks are selected, often as immature juveniles, and grown out in suitable conditions to sexual maturity. These animals require stable water characteristics and a well-balanced, species-dependent, protein rich diet. This enhances the germinal tissue for future seed stock as it is formed in juveniles. The pond or tank in which broodfish are held must be a suitable size to hold and condition the broodstock.Helm, M. M., Bourne, N. and Lovatelli, A. (2004).Hatchery Culture of Bivalves: A practical manual. Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, Rome. Dependent on the species involved you need to alter the number of individuals, and often separate the sexes. Sex separation enables the broodstock males and females to be subjected to different conditions where necessary. For example, male and female sturgeons respond to different hormone levels,Perry's Semenkova, T., Barannikova, I., Kime, D. E., McAllister, B. G., Bayunova, L., Dyubin, V. and Kolmakov, N. (2002). Sex steroid profiles in female and male stellate sturgeon (Acipenserstellatus Pallas) during final maturation induced by hormonal treatment. Journal of Applied Ichthyology, 18, 375‚Äì381. this also allows more control over eggs and sperm. The characteristics of the water in which the mature broodstocks are held must be manipulated. The aquaculturist must consider the appropriate oxygen concentration, temperature, and pH of the waterMoorhead, J. A. and Zeng, C. (2011). Breeding of the forktail blenny Meiacanthus atrodorsalis: Broodstock management and larval rearing. Aquaculture, 318, 248‚Äì252. all of which can be species specific. The feeding regime of broodstocks is species specific and requires consideration of timing and composition of the food. Protein, lipid and fatty acid composition is particularly important. The quantity of food intake can be altered to influence spawning and maturity, for example low rations have been shown to reduce the number of fish reaching maturity while increasing the fecundity of those which do. When fry are desired, spawning can be induced in broodstocks by manipulation of relevant environmental factors. In particular the photoperiod can be altered to imply that it is time to spawn. A shortended photoperiod is known to advance spawning times while a lengthened photoperiod can delay spawning.Prat, F., Zanuy, S, Bromage, N. and Carrillo, M. (1999) Effects of constant short and long photoperiod regimes on the spawning performance and sex steroid levels of female and male sea bass. Journal of Fish Biology, 54, 125‚Äì13. Artificial light can be used to change the apparent day length and indicate different seasonal features so as to delay spawning. Water temperature can be increased for the same purpose. Following spawning the female broodfish are often stressed and have lost weight. They require extra care and abundant feeding at this time to ensure survival to the next spawning season.  Advantages  Managers can select for reproductive characteristics which influence the egg producing capability of individuals and increase fecundity by providing them with optimal environment and diets.Bromage, N., Hardiman, P., Jones, J., Springate, J., and Bye, V. (1990) Fecundity, egg size and total egg volume differences in 12 stocks of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss Richardson. Aquaculture and Fisheries Management, 21(3), 269‚Äì284. This is further possible in pond-reared populations where traits can be selected for over generations for example, for higher fecundity. The breeding season and spawning times can be shifted thus expanding the seasonal range of production. This leads to more efficient aquaculture because fry are available to the market year round. Hormonal treatments can advance spawning by two to three weeks. Manipulating photoperiod can alter spawning time by over four months and is cheap and straightforward to achieve. Broodstock managers can use or select for traits such as fast growth rates or disease resistance over generations to produce more desirable fish. This ability for genetic improvement of stocks is more efficient and produces higher value stock. Broodstocks also enable you to selectively plan and control all matings. Selective breeding is an important part of the domestication of aquaculture species. Pond-reared broodstocks benefit from the removal of predation which can be a significant cause of mortality in natural populations.Berejikian, B. A. (1995) The effects of hatchery and wild ancestry and experience on the relative ability of steelhead trout fry (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to avoid a benthic predator. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 52, 2476‚Äì2482. They further benefit from the removal of variable environmental impacts. Holding broodstock in an accessible pond or tank offers readily available breeding adults whenever required.  Disadvantages  When broodstocks are used to supplement natural populations they face different selective pressures to normal. Thus they may not have adequate fitness to survive the natural environment, or can alter and decrease natural genetic diversity due to the bottleneck nature of breeding from a smaller population. Broodstocks require supplementation from outside sources regularly to prevent negative effects of closed populations. Domestication of broodstocks in hatcheries can reduce reproductive capabilities and alter other genetic characteristics. For example, a trout stock maintained as a closed population for 20 generations showed reduced number and size of egg production.Gall & Gross, 1978  Examples  = Penaeidae = Shrimp, particularly of the family Penaeidae, are one of the largest internationally traded species.Anyanwu, P. E., Ayinla, O. A., Ebonwu, B. I., Ayaobu-Cookey, I. K., Hamzat, M. B., Ihimekpen, A. F., Matanmi, M. A., Afolabi, E. S., Ajijo, M. R. and Olaluwoye, B. L. (2011). Culture possibilities of Penaeus monodon in Nigeria. Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Science, 6(5), 499‚Äì505. Native stocks are usually collected as sources of broodstock supply .Peixoto, S., Wasielesky, W., Cavalli, R. O. (2011). Broodstock maturation and reproduction of the indigenous pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus paulensis in Brazil: An updated review on research and development. Aquaculture, 315, 9‚Äì15. There are also examples of pond-reared Penaeidae broodstocks. These shrimp are raised in suitable environmental conditions including a 12‚Äì14 hour/day photoperiod, a water temperature of 25‚Äì29 ¬∞C and full seawater salinity with high water exchange rates. = Sydney rock oyster = The Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, has been farmed in New South Wales, Australia for over 100 years.Troup, A. J., Cairns, S. C. and Simpson, R. D. (2005). Growth and mortality of sibling triploid and diploid Sydney rock oysters Saccostrea glomerata (Gould), in the Camden Haven River. Aquaculture Research, 36(11), 1093‚Äì1103. Due to declines in the supply in the past 30 years, New South Wales introduced a selection program in 1990 to breed faster growing stocks.Nell, J. A., Smith, I. R. and McPhee, C. C. (2000). The Sydney rock oyster Saccostrea glomerata (Gould 1850) breeding programme: progress and goals. Aquaculture Research, 31, 45‚Äì49. The utilised broodstocks are held in artificial ponds of around 0.11 ha in size, and at low densities.Maguire, G. B., Wisely, B. and Skeel, M. E. (1981). Cultivation of the Sydney rock oyster Crassostrea commercialis (Iredale and Roughley) in prawn farming ponds. Aquaculture, 24, 63‚Äì75. Broodstocks provided higher numbers of larvae and could be spawned readily providing a more definite source of Sydney rock oysters. = Rainbow trout = Global production of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, requires over 3 billion eggs per year. This number is met because of broodstocks which undergo selection and conditioning in hatcheries. Trout have been reared artificially for over 80 years.Gall, G.A.E. and Gross, S.J., 1978. A genetics analysis of the performance of three rainbow trout broodstocks. Aquaculture, 15, 113‚Äì127. Rainbow trout broodstocks are commonly manipulated to delay maturation and spawning time in order to provide eggs regularly and optimise supply. Artificial selection has favoured larger fish due to evidence of correlations between fish size and fecundity.  References   External links  *Definition of \\"broodstock\\" given by FishBase.

An attacking midfielder, he played 470 games and scored 184 goals in his entire career. Biography Neto was born in Santo Ant√¥nio de Posse, a small town near Campinas, in the State of S√£o Paulo. Club career Neto began his football career very early in life, playing for Campinas-based team Guarani at youth level, before being promoted to the senior side. In the mid-1980s he also played for Bangu (in Rio de Janeiro) and S√£o Paulo, before returning to Guarani once again. In 1988, he brought more attention upon himself by scoring a goal from a bicycle-kick in the S√£o Paulo State Championship finals against Corinthians. In 1989 Neto played for Palmeiras and was subsequently transferred to Corinthians, where he remained for a good part of his career, wearing club's the number 10 shirt, and becoming an idol with the club's fans in the beginning of the nineties. With his precise passing game and strong personality, he was the key player during the 1990 National Championship in Brazil, when Corinthians won the finals against S√£o Paulo. After almost five years and 114 goals for Corinthians, his time with the club came to a close. However, even today Neto is remembered as one of the most iconic players in the club's history. After his spell with Corinthians, he played for many other clubs, in Brazil (Ara√ßatuba, Atl√©tico Mineiro, Matsubara, Santos) and abroad (Millonarios of Colombia). He is one of the few players to have played for all four major teams in the state of S√£o Paulo. Neto's career was always plagued by weight problems and disagreements with referees and club managers, due to his strong character. His most famous episode was when he spat in referee Jos√© Aparecido de Oliveira's face, earning himself a 4-month suspension from the games. Neto says this is the only regrettable thing he did in his career. Neto retired from professional football at the end of the nineties. International career Neto was a member of the Brazilian under-23 team that won a bronze medal at the 1983 Pan American Games. Following his performances in the S√£o Paulo State Championship throughout the season, in 1988, Neto was named to the Brazilian national team that went to Seoul to play in the Summer Olympic Games. In the final against the Soviet Union, Neto helped set up Rom√°rio's opening goal of the match from a corner-kick, however, the Soviets came from behind to defeat Brazil 2‚Äì1 in extra-time to capture the gold medal. Neto was later also included in the Brazilian squad that finished second in the 1991 Copa Am√©rica in Chile; under manager Falc√£o, he was named the team's captain, and wore the number 10 shirt throughout the tournament. He scored his only goal of the competition from a penalty in a 2‚Äì1 win over Bolivia on 9 July, in the first round group stage. In total, he made 26 appearances for Brazil at international level between 1988 and 1993, scoring 7 goals; 9 of his appearances came with the Olympic youth side, and 16 with the senior team, including one appearance and one goal in an unofficial friendly. Style of play A set-piece specialist, in Brazil Neto is commonly considered to be one of the greatest free kick takers ever, and one of the best Brazilian players of the early 1990s. A versatile midfielder, he was capable of playing in several offensive midfield positions, but was usually deployed as an attacking midfielder behind the forwards, due to his technique, range of passing, and excellent playmaking skills; he was also occasionally used as a second striker or as a winger. In addition to being known for his accuracy from dead ball situations, he was also noted for his precise long passing, and his ability to act as a leader for his teammates on the field. After football After the conclusion of his footballing career, Neto briefly served as the manager of Guarani. He later became a commentator and sports pundit for TV Bandeirantes. Neto's simple way of speaking, and his blunt, \\"ogre-like\\" behavior have made him a famous broadcaster in Brazil. Working alongside names such as Jos√© Luiz Datena and Milton Neves, Neto has, however, clashed against fellow sports journalists such as Tiago Leifert and various footballers. Personal life The son of a former military policeman, Neto is a father of two children. After his retirement from professional football, Neto underwent a gastric bypass surgery to help with his excess weight. The surgery was a success, and the footballer, who was once plagued by weight problems, has since ran in marathons.

In late 2003, he was the target of a failed assassination attempt, when a car bomb exploded beneath his vehicle as his wife was backing it out of their driveway. Biography Born in Israel, Makhoul studied philosophy and sociology at the University of Haifa, gaining a BA. During his time at university he also became chairman of the National Union of Arab Students. After graduating he worked as a sociologist, and was a member of the Emile Touma Institute for Political and Historical Research. He is married to Suad. =Political career= Knesset activities Makhoul was elected to the Knesset in 1999 on Hadash's list, and re-elected in 2003.

He was the author of nine major books, several of which attempted to develop a fresh outlook in Christian apologetics. He also wrote essays that were published in several other books, and was a contributor of articles to periodicals such as The Christian Century and Christianity Today.  Family  Carnell was born in Antigo, Wisconsin on June 28, 1919, and was the third of four children born to Herbert Carnell and Fannie Carstens. He was married to Shirley Rowe, a school teacher from Wisconsin.  Education  Carnell began his tertiary education at Wheaton College, Illinois, where he majored in philosophy and received his B.A. degree. His philosophical mentor at Wheaton was the Calvinist apologist Gordon Clark. Carnell then commenced theological studies at Westminster Theological Seminary where he was awarded the Th.B and Th.M degrees. John Murray and Cornelius Van Til were two of his lecturers who influenced him greatly. He then proceeded to doctoral studies in history and the philosophy of religion at Harvard Divinity School. During his candidacy at Harvard, Carnell also enrolled as a doctoral candidate in philosophy at Boston University under the tutelage of Edgar S. Brightman. Carnell's theological dissertation at Harvard was on Reinhold Niebuhr, while his philosophical dissertation at Boston was on S√∏ren Kierkegaard.  Apologetic writings  During the period of his doctoral studies, Carnell composed a work in Christian apologetics that he submitted to William Eerdmans in a competition for the Evangelical Book Award. Carnell's manuscript won the five thousand dollar prize, which in 1948 was a considerable sum of money. It was hailed in Evangelical circles as a masterly new work in apologetics, and established a reputation for Carnell as a brilliant young and rising theologian. The book, which was released as An Introduction to Christian Apologetics, reflected the apologetic influences of his mentors Gordon Clark and Cornelius Van Til, and also the philosophical influence of Edgar Sheffield Brightman. In the book he sought to show that Christian faith was systematically logical, factual and rationally satisfying as it best fitted the facts as an explanation for the human condition. His apologetic gambits dealt with topics such as Biblical criticism, the problem of miracles, evolution, and the existential problem of soul-sorrow in an effort to show that Christianity offers a coherent view of reality. In many respects his apologetic approach represented an attempt at combining the deductive rationalist and presuppositionalist methods of Clark and Van Til, with a test for truth he called \\"systematic consistency\\". Later analysts of Evangelical apologetics have dubbed his apologetic method as either a \\"combinationalist\\" or \\"verificational\\" approach. Irving Hexham has noted in his survey of apologetic responses to New Age spirituality that Carnell's approach had some influence on the way in which Francis Schaeffer developed his apologetic writings. Hexham states, \\"Another source for Schaeffer's ideas was the evangelical philosopher E. J. Carnell, although Schaeffer was reluctant to admit this unless directly asked.\\" (Hexham, \\"The Evangelical Response to the New Age\\" in Perspectives on the New Age, edited by James Lewis & J. G. Melton, p. 322). Carnell's second apologetic text, A Philosophy of the Christian Religion, explored questions of value that are personally and existentially satisfying. This study is technically known as axiology. Two further apologetic works Christian Commitment and The Kingdom of Love and the Pride of Life delved into subjective issues of introspective meaning. Both texts reflected his deep study and appreciation of the work of S√∏ren Kierkegaard. Carnell emphasised the meaning of authentic discipleship and commitment to the way of Christ as grounded in God's love. After graduating from Harvard, Carnell joined the faculty of the recently founded Fuller Seminary. Carnell was attracted to this seminary as it was part of an emerging movement of reform within Protestant Fundamentalism. The background to this new movement of reform lies in the nineteenth century and the early twentieth century. = Fundamentalist-Liberal controversies = In the nineteenth century Evangelicalism had been the major expression of Protestant theology and church life in North America. Towards the end of that century a major division occurred in Protestant thought in Europe, England, and America that transcended denominational affiliations. The division comprised two broad camps: Liberal Christianity and Evangelical Christianity. The tensions between these two camps arose over developments in Enlightenment based philosophy where theistic or supernatural explanations of reality were brought into question. The questioning of theism was not confined to abstract concerns in philosophy, but also developed as modern historical consciousness dawned. This new historical consciousness was presaged in the seventeenth century controversies of Deism where Biblical miracles, and especially Christ's resurrection, were called into doubt. Alongside the debates about miracles came new conjectures about the authorship of the Biblical books, and investigations into possible sub-documents and written sources undergirding the present biblical texts. A further element of controversy for Christians at that time arose in the wake of the theory of evolution as propounded in 1859 by Charles Darwin. The Genesis narratives of the creation and Noah's Flood were brought into doubt, and the science versus religion debates accelerated. Those in the Liberal camp sought to reconcile their faith and theology in light of the modern historical consciousness and evolutionary thought. Some within the Liberal camp began to redefine the message of Christ in light of socialist criticism, and the Social Gospel developed in the popular writings of Charles Sheldon (the inventor of the \\"What Would Jesus Do\\" slogan) and in the theological writings of Walter Rauschenbusch. Those in the Evangelical camp began to argue that the Liberals were engaged in a massive compromise, if not betrayal, of the central tenets of Christianity. Many of the nineteenth century Evangelicals had prized higher learning, cultural engagement, and pursued matters of social justice and reform (like anti-vivisection, anti- slavery, prison reform). However, as the gospel message of the Liberals was perceived to be largely about social reform and not about personal repentance from sin, the suspicions between the two camps widened. In 1915 a multi-volume work called The Fundamentals was published, which comprised a variety of tracts that reasserted traditional Christian teachings and challenged modern skeptical thinking and Liberal Christian ideas. It is from these volumes that the subsequent label of fundamentalist was coined in the 1920s and in the wake of the famous Scopes trial on the teaching of evolution. = Neo-Evangelicals = In the early 1940s a number of those who had grown up in a fundamentalist ethos began to question the eccentricities of the subculture, and particularly its disengagement from both the academy and mainstream culture. A new organization known as the National Association of Evangelicals was formed with the agenda of reforming society. Some of the emerging leaders of this movement, which came to be dubbed \\"Neo-Evangelical\\" included Carl F. H. Henry, Harold Ockenga and Billy Graham. These men were convinced that a two-pronged approach to societal transformation was possible. One approach was to reengage the academy bringing a distinctly Christian worldview to bear on disciplines such as history, philosophy, science, literature, art and law. The other approach involved itinerant evangelistic preachers proclaiming the message at the grass roots level of society. As the Neo-Evangelical leaders pushed towards these goals, a division occurred between them and their more conservative and sometimes militant colleagues who continued to pursue the cause of fundamentalism.  Neo-Evangelical leader  Carnell had grown up as a fundamentalist and been trained at Wheaton College, which was one of the bastions of fundamentalism. He was, however, dissatisfied with the anti- intellectual tendencies he discerned in fundamentalist culture. He was therefore very receptive to the message of Neo-Evangelicals who sought to reform both fundamentalism and the wider society. As part of his contribution to challenging the culture of fundamentalism, Carnell confronted the issue initially by dealing with the advent of television. Some fundamentalists feared that television was a device in the hands of the devil. In his book Television: Servant or Master? Carnell dealt with some of the issues concerning modern communication systems, the use of technology in the promotion of the Christian message, and engaging with wider cultural concerns. Carnell scorned the anti-intellectual tendencies in fundamentalism, and attacked its legalistic and negative mentality about culture. In 1954 Carnell was appointed the President of Fuller Seminary. As some of the Neo- Evangelicals, like Carl Henry and Harold Ockenga, had been instrumental in establishing the seminary, Carnell's rising profile as an apologist, theologian, and now seminary professor, catapulted him into the spotlight. In his book The Case for Orthodox Theology Carnell sought to separate the Neo- Evangelicals from the fundamentalists by arguing that a Reformed Orthodox theology was considerably different from fundamentalism. He attacked the legalism and hypocrisy he saw in fundamentalism and argued that it was \\"orthodoxy gone cultic\\". He highlighted what he saw as critical deficiencies in fundamentalist thought and practice. As a result of his published diatribe Carnell became the object of much criticism from fundamentalist preachers. Carnell's personal life was not without difficulties as he suffered from depression and insomnia, and received psychiatric treatment including electro- convulsive therapy. His treatment included doses of barbiturates, and he died in 1967 from a drug overdose. The cause of his death has been the subject of much conjecture as the coronial finding was unable to determine whether the dose was accidental or not. Carnell's legacy, however, is generally regarded as a positive contribution to the re-emergence of Evangelicals in scholarly pursuits. His apologetic contributions influenced the post-World War Two generation of evangelicals, and emphasized the importance of the gospel and culture. He was greatly admired by his students at Fuller Seminary.  Publications  * An Introduction to Christian Apologetics, William B. Eerdmans, Grand Rapids, 1948. * Television: Servant or Master?

He is the current team coordinator of Senegal, appointed by head coach Aliou Ciss√© in 2015. Club career Born in Dakar, Senegal, Diatta moved to France when he was only one year old. Before moving to Olympique Lyon in 2004, Diatta played 142 games for Stade Rennais, scoring 9 goals in that time. Before his time at Rennes, he was at Marseille, but never actually played a game for them. Diatta's first club was Toulouse FC. He spent one season there and played 25 games without scoring. In his first year (2004‚Äì05) with Lyon he played 19 games. During his second year (2005‚Äì06) at Lyon, he was troubled with injury and only makes 13 appearances also without goals. On August 2006, he left Lyon on free transfer in search for regular team football, settling at AS Saint-√âtienne. On 7 March 2008, after a week's trial at Newcastle United, Diatta agreed to a short-term deal until the end of the season after buying out his contract at Be≈üikta≈ü J.K. The deal was finally confirmed by the club on 14 March after a week of confusion. He made his first team debut for Newcastle as a substitute in a Premier League match against Reading on 5 April but was released on 15 May. Diatta joined Stoke City on trial in January 2009. On 20 March, however, he signed for Hamilton Academical on a short-term deal until the end of the season. After just one month, on 25 April, the 33-year-old Senegalese defender left Hamilton to join Al-Ahli Sports Club in Qatar.

The population of the civil parish as of the 2011 census was 300. The village is situated amongst mixed farmland and woodland on a slight rise roughly six miles north north west of Doncaster, or one mile off the A1. The village church is dedicated to St Helen. The village pub is the Burghwallis. History In contrast with most of the villages surrounding Doncaster, very little in the way of residential development took place in Burghwallis during the 19th and 20th centuries. Today the village is one of a handful in the area to have retained much of its original character and has a very peaceful small- scale rural feel. No church is mentioned in Burghwallis' entry in the Domesday Book; however, the Grade II Listed St Helen's chapel is likely to have been either standing or under construction at the time. Several architectural features suggest it is of a pre-Conquest design, and it is held to have been built between 950 and 1100 AD. Parish records as far back as 1596 exist and are available from the Doncaster archives. The parish was the home of Catholic Martyr John Anne, who lived in the Hall during the 16th century. Jeremy Clarkson spent his childhood on the nearby Home Farm. Etymology Burgh in general tends to mean town/township in Old Norse and Old German. The parish is referred to simply as \\"Burg\\" in the Domesday book, becoming Burghwallis in the early 13th century when Dionysia ‚Äì one of seven surviving daughters of the local lord ‚Äì was married into the Wallis family. The Wallis family line persisted among the local landowners through to the early 17th centuryhttp://www.burghwallis.com/village/articles/hunter.htm by which time the name of the settlement was so far removed from that of the local aristocracy that the succeeding Anne family appear not to have thought to change it. The name literally means \\"village of the Wallis family\\". The music box ghost Burghwallis Hall, aka St Anne's Convent, is reputed to have a ghost. On 14 March 1934 a mother smothered her son while he slept, then concealed the body in a closet. Her husband discovered the body, then murdered his wife and took his own life. A music box is reputed to have been heard through the corridors along with the voice of a small boy. The ghost of the man in grey and a small woman are also claimed to be seen walking the corridors.

Shibaev article at the Discover Moscow website Yakov's mother Elizaveta Mikhailovna Protazanova (nee Vinokurova) was a native Muscovite. She finished the Elizabeth Institute for Noble Maidens. Her brother Mikhail Vinokurov was close friends with the Sadovsky theatrical family and made a great impact on young Protazanov. In 1900 Yakov graduated from the Moscow Commercial College and started working as a merchant, although he wasn't happy about his choice of profession. In 1904 he left Russia and spent several years in France and Italy, self-educating. After his return in 1906 Protazanov joined the Gloria film company in Moscow as a screenwriter and director's assistant. He also met his future wife there ‚Äî Frida Vasilievna Kennike, who happened to be a sister of one of the Gloria's co-founders. In 1910 Gloria became part of the cinema factory headed by Paul Thiemann and Friedrich Reinhardt. Protazanov was finally given a director's chair, although, according to his memories, he took part in basically every filming process, including cinematography, stage property and bookkeeping. His most notable works of that period are The Song of the Prophet Oleg based on Alexander Pushkin's poem and Departure of a Grand Old Man about the last days of Leo Tolstoy. In 1914 he joined Joseph N. Ermolieff's film studio where he worked up till his emigration in 1920. In the period between 1911 and 1920 Protazanov wrote and directed some 80 features, including The Queen of Spades (1916) and Father Sergius (1918), which have been acclaimed as his masterpieces. Ivan Mozhukhin starred in many of his early films. He emigrated to Europe in 1920 following the Russian Civil War along with Ermolieff's group where he worked at various French- and German-based film studios. He returned to Russia in 1923. The following year he produced Aelita based on Alexei Tolstoy's novel. It was one of the first science fiction movies to depict a space flight and an alien society. His next film The Tailor from Torzhok was released to a great success and established him as one of the leading comedy directors. He discovered many talents, such as Igor Ilyinsky, Mikhail Zharov, Anatoli Ktorov, Vera Maretskaya, Yuliya Solntseva, Georgy Millyar, Serafima Birman, Nikolai Batalov and Mikhail Klimov.

Yesod, located near the base of the Tree, is the sephirah below Hod and Netzach, and above Malkuth (the kingdom). It is seen as a vehicle allowing movement from one thing or condition to another (the power of connection). Yesod, Kabbalah, & the Tree of Life are Jewish concepts adopted by various philosophical systems including Christianity, New Age Eastern-based mysticism, and Western esoteric practices. Jewish Kabbalah According to Jewish Kabbalah, Yesod is the foundation upon which God has built the world. It also serves as a transmitter between the sephirot above, and the reality below. The light of the upper sephirot gather in Yesod and are channelled to Malkuth below. In this manner, Yesod is associated with the sexual organs. The masculine Yesod collects the vital forces of the sephirot above, and transmits these creative and vital energies into the feminine Malkuth below. Yesod channels, Malkuth receives. In turn, it is through Malkuth that the earth is able to interact with the divinity. Yesod plays the role of collecting and balancing the different and opposing energies of Hod and Netzach, and also from Tiferet above it, storing and distributing it throughout the world. It is likened to the 'engine-room' of creation. The Cherubim is the angelic choir connected to Yesod, headed by the Archangel Gabriel. In contrast, the demonic order in the Qliphothic sphere opposite of Yesod is Gamaliel, ruled by the Archdemon Lilith. Other philosophic systems =Christianity= According to Jewish Kaballistic philosophy, Yesod is responsible for the powers of communication, connection and contact with external reality within the soul, unifying the material world of Malkuth with the other Sephiroth. Therefore, some Christians compare Yesod to the third person of the Holy Trinity, the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is defined by some Christians as one aspect of the Triune God. These Christians believe that the Holy Spirit is the aspect of god that unifies God with humanity. =Esoteric philosophy= In esoteric Western philosophy, according to the writer Dion Fortune, Yesod is considered to be \\"of supreme importance to the practical occultist...the Treasure House of Images, the sphere of Maya, Illusion.\\"Fortune, The Mystical Qabalah, page 1 References External links * Sefirot Yesod (at Inner.org) * Yesod: The Translator * Lessons in Tanya Category:Sephirot Category:Kabbalistic words and phrases Category:Jewish symbols Category:Christian Kabbalah Category:Hermetic Qabalah Category:Kabbalah Category:Moon in culture ","title":"Yesod"},{"id":"2518561","title":"Laura Regan"},{"id":"2518566","text":"Michael Hugh Medwin, OBE (18 July 1923 ‚Äì 26 February 2020) was an English actor and film producer.  Life and career  Medwin was born in London. He was educated at Canford School, Dorset, and the Institute Fischer, Montreux, Switzerland. He first appeared on stage in 1940. Medwin's West End theatre credits include Man and Superman, The Rivals, Love for Love, Duckers and Lovers, Alfie, St Joan of the Stockyards, and What the Butler Saw.Biographical note for Michael Medwin, from programme for Noises Off, Savoy Theatre, December 1984. At the National Theatre he played a season which included Weapons of Happiness (Ralph Makepeace), Volpone (Corvino) and The Madras House. He appeared in Black Ball Game at the Lyric Hammersmith. He also played Lloyd Dallas in one of the casts of the long-running production of Noises Off in the early 1980s. He is probably best known for his role as radio boss Don Satchley in the BBC television detective series Shoestring, as well as for playing Scrooge's nephew Fred in the film version of Scrooge, a musical based on Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, and for his role in The Army Game, a British television comedy series of the late 1950s and early 1960s. With Bernard Bresslaw, Leslie Fyson and Alfie Bass, he took the theme tune from The Army Game into the UK Singles Chart in 1958, where it peaked at number 5. at the B.F.I -Accessed 19 December 2015New York Times by Hal Erickson, Rani,All Movie Guide- Accessed 19 December 2015 As well as his role in Shoestring, he played Colin's boss Mr Langley (of the Langley Book of Horror) in the Mel Smith comedy series Colin's Sandwich. In 1961, Medwin played the lead named Michael in BBC Radio Light Programme comedy series about an advertising company called Something to Shout About. He made many film appearances, taking a leading role as Ginger Edwards in the 1953 Guy Hamilton film The Intruder, for which one critic wrote that Medwin \\"gives a brilliant study of a good fellow gone wrong.\\"Campbell Dixon, The Daily Telegraph, 17 October 1953, quoted on the programme note for 'Projecting the Archive - The Intruder', BFI Documentation Unit, 2012. Others included Carry On Nurse (1959) and The Longest Day (1962), before turning to producing films. Among the films he produced for Memorial Enterprises, a company he established with actor Albert Finney, are Charlie Bubbles (1967), directed by Finney, and Lindsay Anderson's If.... (1968), which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. He worked again with Anderson on O Lucky Man! (1973), continuing the story of the Mick Travis character from their earlier film. Medwin has been quoted many times as saying \\"I knew at a young age I was going to be an actor: acting has always been in my bones\\". He also said that Charles Laughton and Edward G. Robinson were the two biggest influences in his life of acting, and considered being appointed OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2005 Queens Birthday Honour's List for Services to Drama the single greatest thing that ever happened to him. As a play producer, his work includes Spring and Port Wine, Alpha Beta, A Day in the Death of Joe Egg, Forget Me Not Lane and Another Country.

It is a regional cuisine that is common in Western North Carolina, and is typically consumed as a breakfast and lunch food. It has been suggested that livermush derives from scrapple. By law in North Carolina, the product must consist of at least 30% pig liver. Several festivals exist in North Carolina that are dedicated to the food. Though sometimes considered the same as liver pudding, livermush generally contains more cornmeal and is coarser in texture. It is generally prepared using a different recipe compared to liver pudding, though the distinction can be blurred. For example, sometimes livermush is referred to as \\"liver pudding\\". Overview Livermush is composed of pig liver, pig head parts such as snouts and ears, cornmeal and seasonings. It is commonly spiced with pepper and sage. The meat ingredients are all cooked and then ground, after which the cornmeal and seasoning is added. The final mixture is formed into blocks which are then refrigerated. It typically has a low fat content and a high protein content. It is a regional cuisine that is commonly found in the western part of North Carolina, as well as being noticeably present in central North Carolina. It is also consumed in other parts of the state, and is available in some areas in other states as well, such as Georgia, Virginia and areas in Florida. Livermush is mass-produced by two Shelby, North Carolina meat packing companies, Jenkins Foods and Mack‚Äôs Liver Mush and Meat Co., who distribute it to various states. It is cooked by cutting a slice off of a premade loaf and frying it. At breakfast it is served alongside grits and eggs. For lunch it can be made into a sandwich with mayonnaise, grape jelly or mustard, either fried, or left cold. As livermush's popularity has risen, it has appeared as an ingredient in dishes such as omelettes and pizzas. History It has been suggested that livermush derives from scrapple, and likely originated from German settlers who traveled south through the Appalachian mountains in the 1700s. In the 1930s and 1940s, a five-pound portion of livermush cost around 10 cents. Today, by law in North Carolina, genuine livermush must consist of at least 30% pig liver. Events Shelby, North Carolina hosts an annual Livermush Exposition, which began in 1987 to celebrate the unique delicacy. In that year the Cleveland County Commissioners and the Shelby City Council passed resolutions proclaiming that \\"livermush is the most delicious, most economical and most versatile of meats.\\" Other towns in North Carolina that have livermush festivals include Drexel and Marion.

She is the largest restored Dutch freightship and the only remaining Dutch three-masted topsail schooner. Her home port is Rotterdam. As a freighter with a deadweight of 400 tons, she transported mainly clay, stone and wood, but also herring, bran, potatoes, straw and bananas. In the 1930s, a heavier diesel engine was installed and some sail-rigging was removed (including the aft mast). In 1939, she was sold to a Danish shipping company and, rebaptised Fuglen II, became one of the most modern ships in the Danish fleet. In 1954, she was sold to a Swede, renamed Sylvan and thoroughly rebuilt to a modern motorised coaster. In 1988, she was brought back to the Netherlands. She had always been maintained well, but restoration to the original state turned out too expensive for private funding. So a foundation collected money from various sources, partly by selling shares in the ship. Restoration lasted from 1990 to 1992, with the help of her last Dutch captain, Jan Kramer, and three maritime museums to ensure authenticity. From 1996 through 1998 she made a trip around the world (route: Red Sea, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia, New-Zealand, Cape Horn, Antarctic, A√ßores). Maintenance is paid for through paying passengers and company presentations. A new voyage around the world started on November 3, 2012 and ended in May 2014. This brought the ship to Cabo Verde, Brazil, Cape Of Good Hope, Mauritius, Cape Leeuwin, New Zealand, Cape Horn and Antarctica. In October 2013 Oosterschelde participated in the International Fleet Review 2013 in Sydney, Australia.

The prescaler takes the basic timer clock frequency (which may be the CPU clock frequency or may be some higher or lower frequency) and divides it by some value before feeding it to the timer, according to how the prescaler register(s) are configured. The prescaler values, referred to as prescales, that may be configured might be limited to a few fixed values (powers of 2), or they may be any integer value from 1 to 2^P, where P is the number of prescaler bits. The purpose of the prescaler is to allow the timer to be clocked at the rate a user desires. For shorter (8 and 16-bit) timers, there will often be a tradeoff between resolution (high resolution requires a high clock rate) and range (high clock rates cause the timer to overflow more quickly). For example, one cannot (without some tricks) achieve 1 ¬µs resolution and a 1 sec maximum period using a 16-bit timer. In this example using 1 ¬µs resolution would limit the period to about 65ms maximum. However the prescaler allows tweaking the ratio between resolution and maximum period to achieve a desired effect. Example of use Prescalers are typically used at very high frequency to extend the upper frequency range of frequency counters, phase locked loop (PLL) synthesizers, and other counting circuits. When used in conjunction with a PLL, a prescaler introduces a normally undesired change in the relationship between the frequency step size and phase detector comparison frequency. For this reason, it is common to either restrict the integer to a low value, or use a dual-modulus prescaler in this application. A dual-modulus prescaler is one that has the ability to selectively divide the input frequency by one of two (normally consecutive) integers, such as 32 and 33. Common fixed-integer microwave prescalers are available in modulus 2, 4, 8, 5 and 10, and can operate at frequencies in excess of 10 GHz.For example, in 2011, the Hittite Microwave Corporation advertised prescalers from 100MHz to 10GHz: Nomenclature A prescaler is essentially a counter-divider, and thus the names may be used somewhat interchangeably.

Extremely isolated, Applecross was only accessible by boat until the early 20th century, and for many years after that the only road access was over one of Scotland's most notoriously treacherous roads, the ('Pass of the Cattle'), which crosses the peninsula and reaches a maximum height of , below the high Sg√πrr a' Chaorachain. The settlement is now connected via a winding coastal road which travels around the edge of the peninsula to Shieldaig and Torridon. The road skirts the shore of the Inner Sound and Loch Torridon. Early history Rocky shores of Applecross Applecross's name is an anglicisation of the Pictish name Aporcrosan, 'confluence of the [river] Crossan' ( in modern Gaelic). The name is derived from the Pictish aber- and Scottish Gaelic cros. Historically, the settlement is linked with St M√°elrubai (Old Irish form) or M√°el Ruba, who came to Scotland in 671 from the major Irish monastery of Bangor, County Down. He founded Aporcrosan in 672 in what was then Pictish territory, and was the monastery's first abbot, dying on 21 April 722 in his eightieth year. The deaths of several of his successors as abbot are recorded in the Irish Annals into the early ninth century. The early monastery was located around the site of the later parish church (present building erected 1817). A large, unfinished cross-slab standing in the churchyard and three extremely finely carved fragments of another (or more than one?) preserved within the church are evidence of the early monastery. The surrounding district is known as 'the sanctuary' in Gaelic. Its boundaries were once marked by crosses. The stub of one, destroyed in 1870, survives among farm buildings at Camusterrach. There are many churches dedicated to M√°el Ruba on Skye and throughout northern Scotland, the saint's name sometimes taking distorted forms (e.g. 'Rufus' at Keith in Banffshire). Loch Maree and its holy island of Eilean Ma-Ruibhe (site of an early church and holy well) are both named after the saint. The area around Applecross is believed to be one of the earliest settled parts of Scotland. The coastal settlement of Sand, just to the north of Applecross, is the location of a major archaeological site. Applecross estate The Applecross estate extends to approximately and covers most of the peninsula. In the second half of the 16th century, the lands of Applecross came into the possession of Alexander Mackenzie (died 1650), an illegitimate son of Colin Cam Mackenzie of Kintail. With a brief interruption between 1715 and 1724 (a period of forfeiture caused by Applecross's part in the 1715 Uprising), the estate remained in the ownership of Mackenzie's heirs until the mid-19th century, when it was sold to the Duke of Leeds.Alexander Mackenzie, History of the Mackenzies (2nd edition, Inverness, A. & W.

Following the death of the 10th Baron Middleton in 1924, the estate was sold to the Wills family.

The material and cultural conditions in France and associated territories around the year 1100 unleashed what the scholar Charles Homer Haskins termed the \\"Renaissance of the 12th century\\" and, for over the next hundred years, writers, \\"jongleurs\\", \\"clercs\\" and poets produced a profusion of remarkable creative works in all genres. Although the dynastic struggles of the Hundred Years' War and the Black Death pandemic of the fourteenth century in many ways curtailed this creative production, the fifteenth century laid the groundwork for the French Renaissance. Language Up to roughly 1340, the Romance languages spoken in the Middle Ages in the northern half of what is today France are collectively known as \\"ancien fran√ßais\\" (\\"Old French\\") or \\"langues d'o√Øl\\" (languages where one says \\"o√Øl\\" to mean \\"yes\\"); following the Germanic invasions of France in the fifth century, these Northern dialects had developed distinctly different phonetic and syntactical structures from the languages spoken in southern France. The language in southern France is known as \\"langue d'oc\\" or the Occitan language family (a language where one says \\"oc\\" to mean \\"yes\\"), also known under the name of one of its dialects, the Proven√ßal language). The Western peninsula of Brittany spoke Breton, a Celtic language. Catalan was spoken in the South, and Germanic languages and Franco-Proven√ßal were spoken in the East. The various dialects of Old French developed into what are recognised as regional languages today. Languages which developed from dialects of Old French include Bourguignon, Champenois, Franc-Comtois, Francien (theoretical), Gallo, Lorrain, Norman, Anglo-Norman (spoken in England after the Norman Conquest of 1066), Picard, Poitevin, Saintongeais and Walloon. From 1340 to the beginning of the seventeenth century, a generalized French language became clearly distinguished from the other competing O√Øl languages. This is referred to as Middle French (\\"moyen fran√ßais\\"). The vast majority of literary production in Old French is in verse; the development of prose as a literary form was a late phenomenon (in the late Middle Ages, many of the romances and epics were converted into prose versions). The French language does not have a significant stress accent (like English) or long and short syllables (like Latin). This means that the French metric line is not determined by the number of beats, but by the number of syllables. The most common metric lengths are the ten-syllable line (decasyllable), the eight-syllable line (octosyllable) and the twelve-syllable line (the \\"alexandrine\\"). Verses could be combined in a variety of ways: blocks (of varying lengths) of assonanced (occasionally rhymed) lines are called \\"laisses\\"; another frequent form is the rhymed couplet. The choice of verse form was generally dictated by the genre. The Old French epics (\\"chansons de geste\\") are generally written in ten-syllable assonanced \\"laisses\\", while the chivalric romance (\\"roman\\") was usually written in octosyllabic rhymed couplets. Early texts The earliest extant French literary texts date from the ninth century, but very few texts before the eleventh century have survived. The first literary works written in Old French were saints' lives. The Canticle of Saint Eulalie, written in the second half of the ninth century, is generally accepted as the first such text. It is a short poem that recounts the martyrdom of a young girl. The best known of the early Old French saints' lives is the Vie de saint Alexis, the life of Saint Alexis, a translation/rewriting of a Latin legend. Saint Alexis fled from his family's home in Rome on his wedding night and dwelled as a hermit in Syria until a mystical voice began telling people of his holiness. In order to avoid the earthly honor that came with such fame, he left Syria and was driven back to Rome, where he lived as a beggar at his family's house, unrecognized by all until his death. He was only identified later when the pope read his name in a letter held in the dead saint's hand. Although the saint left his family in order to devote his life more fully to God, the poem makes clear that his father, mother, and wife are saved by the Alexis' intercession and join him in Paradise. The earliest and best surviving text is in St. Albans Psalter, written probably at St Albans, England, in the second or third decade of the twelfth century. This provenance is indicative of the fact that many of the most important early texts were composed in Anglo-Norman dialect. The Chanson de Geste At the beginning of the 13th century, Jean Bodel, in his Chanson de Saisnes, divided medieval French narrative literature into three subject areas: * the Matter of France or Matter of Charlemagne * the Matter of Rome ‚Äì romances in an ancient setting (see roman below) * the Matter of Britain ‚Äì Arthurian romances, Breton lais (see roman below) The first of these is the subject area of the chansons de geste (\\"songs of exploits\\" or \\"songs of (heroic) deeds\\"), epic poems typically composed in ten- syllable assonanced (occasionally rhymed) laisses. More than one hundred chansons de geste have survived in around three hundred manuscripts.La Chanson de Roland. Edited and Translated into Modern French by Ian Short. Paris: Livre de Poche, 1990. p. 12. The chief theme of the earliest French epics was the court of Charlemagne, Charles Martel and Charles the Bald and their wars against the Moors and Saracens, or disputes between kings and their rebellious vassals. The oldest and most celebrated of the chansons de geste is The Song of Roland (earliest version composed c. 1098), seen by some as the national epic of France (comparable with Beowulf in England, the Song of the Nibelungs in Germany and the Lay of el Cid in Spain). It is perhaps no coincidence that the Song of Roland was first written down at a date very close to that of Pope Urban's call (1095) for the First Crusade; its plot may be seen as a glorification of the crusader ethos. The earliest chansons de geste are (more or less) anonymous. They are popular literature (aimed at a warrior class, some say, though the evidence for this is inconclusive). They use an assortment of stock characters: the valiant hero, the brave traitor, the shifty or cowardly traitor, the Saracen, the giant, and so forth. But they also reveal much of the fears and conflicts that were part of the audience's experience. Kings are vain, foolish, old or wily. Insults that threaten honour or cause shame are seen to provoke bloody conflict, which may arise simply from competitiveness among knights or noble families. For discussion of the much debated origins of this epic genre, see Chanson de geste. Approximately one hundred chansons survive, in manuscripts that date from the 12th to the 15th century. Not long after Jean Bodel (above), Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube in his Girart de Vienne set out a grouping of the chansons de geste into three cycles, each named after a chief character or ancestral figure, and each with a central theme, such as loyalty to a feudal chief, or the defence of Christianity. This is a list of the cycles with a few of the chansons that belong to each: * The Geste du roi. In these the chief character was Charlemagne or his heirs, and a pervasive theme was his role as the divine champion of Christianity. This cycle contains the earliest and best known of the epics ‚Äì ** The Song of Roland (c. 1098 for the Oxford text, the earliest version: several others exist, including an Occitan version) ** Fierabras (c. 1170) ** Aspremont (c.1190‚Äì1200) ** Huon de Bordeaux (c.1216‚Äì1268) ** Chanson de Saisnes by Jean Bodel (1200) * The Geste de Garin de Monglane, whose central character was William of Orange. These dealt with knights who were typically younger sons without an inheritance who sought land and glory through combat with the Saracens. ** Chanson de Guillaume (c.1100) ** Couronnement de Louis (1130) ** Charroi de N√Æmes (1140) ** Prise d'Orange (1150?) ** Aliscans (1165) ** Aymeri de Narbonne and Girart de Vienne by Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube (1190‚Äì1217) * The Geste de Doon de Mayence (or the \\"rebel vassal cycle\\"); this cycle was concerned with rebels against (often unjust) royal authority and its most famous characters were Renaud de Montauban and Girart de Roussillon. ** Gormond et Isembart ** Girart de Roussillon (1160‚Äì1170) ** Renaud de Montauban or Les quatre fils Aymon (end of the 12th century) ** Raoul de Cambrai (end of the 12th century) ** Do√∂n de Mayence (mid 13th century) * A fourth grouping, not listed by Bertrand, is the Crusade cycle, dealing with the First Crusade and its immediate aftermath, and including: ** Chanson d'Antioche ** Les Ch√©tifs ** Chanson de J√©rusalem New chansons tended to be produced and incorporated into the existing literature in two ways: * A separate period or adventure in the life of an established hero was told (for example, his childhood). * The adventures of one of the ancestors or descendants of an established hero was told. This method of epic expansion, with its obsession with blood line, was to be an important compositional technique throughout the Middle Ages. It also underscores the symbolic weight placed within this culture on family honor, paternal fidelity and on the idea of proving one's filial worth. As the genre matured, it began to borrow elements from the French roman and the role of love became increasingly important. In some chansons de geste an element of self-parody appears, as in the P√®lerinage de Charlemagne. The Roman Miniature from a manuscript of the Roman de la Rose (Oxford, Bodleian Library, Douce 195), folio 1r, portrait of Guillaume de Lorris. Jean Bodel's other two categories‚Äîthe \\"Matter of Rome\\" and the \\"Matter of Britain\\"‚Äîconcern the French romance or \\"roman\\". The term \\"roman\\" signifies, roughly, \\"vernacular\\" (i.e. not Latin), but it is used to designate narrative poetry (\\"romance\\") usually written in octosyllabic rhymed couplets and telling stories of chivalry and love. The most famous \\"romans\\" are those of the \\"Matter of Britain\\" dealing with Arthurian romance, the stories of Tristan and Iseult, the heroic legend of the doomed utopia of Camelot and the Holy Grail. Much of this material derives from Breton (Celtic) legends. The most important of these writers was Chr√©tien de Troyes (twelfth century). The \\"Matter of Rome\\" concerns romances that take place in the ancient world, such as romances dealing with Alexander the Great, Troy, the Aeneid and Oedipus. Yet Bodel's category leaves little place for another important group of romances: those adventurous romances which are often set in Byzantium. Sometimes linked with the \\"roman\\" are the Breton lais, narrative ballads of Britain by Marie de France, many of which have Celtic themes and origins. Around a hundred verse romances survive from the period 1150‚Äì1220. Antoine Adam, Georges Lerminier, and √âdouard Morot-Sir, eds. Litt√©rature fran√ßaise. \\"Tome 1: Des origines √† la fin du XVIIIe si√®cle,\\" Paris: Larousse, 1967, p. 16. From around 1200 on, the tendency was increasingly to write the romances in prose (many of the earlier verse romances were adapted into prose versions), although new verse romances continued to be written to the end of the 14th century., Antoine Adam, Georges Lerminier, and √âdouard Morot-Sir, eds. Litt√©rature fran√ßaise. \\"Tome 1: Des origines √† la fin du XVIIIe si√®cle,\\" Paris: Larousse, 1967, p. 36-37. and it was chiefly in their prose form that many romances were read from the 14th to the 16th century. The success of the early Arthurian romances also led, from around 1200 on, to a restructuring and compiling of the material into vast prose cycles.

The second part of the work (written by Jean de Meun) expands on the initial material with scientific and mythological discussions. The novel would have an enormous impact on French literature up to the Renaissance. Related to the previous romance is the medieval narrative poem called \\"dit\\" (literally \\"spoken\\", i.e. a poem not meant to be sung) which follows the poetic form of the \\"roman\\" (octosyllabic rhymed couplets). These first-person narrative works (which sometimes include inserted lyric poems) often use allegorical dreams (songes), allegorical characters, and the situation of the narrator-lover attempting to return toward or satisfy his lady. The 14th-century poet Guillaume de Machaut is the most famous writers of \\"dits\\"; another notable author of \\"dits\\" is Gautier le Leu. King Ren√© I of Naples's allegorical romance C≈ìur d'amour √©pris (celebrated for its illustrations) is also a work in the same tradition. Lyric poetry Medieval French lyric poetry was indebted to the poetic and cultural traditions in Southern France and Provence‚Äîincluding Toulouse, Poitiers, and the Aquitaine region‚Äîwhere \\"langue d'oc\\" was spoken (Occitan language); in their turn, the Proven√ßal poets were greatly influenced by poetic traditions from the Hispano-Arab world. The Occitan or Proven√ßal poets were called troubadours, from the word \\"trobar\\" (to find, to invent). Lyric poets in Old French are called \\"trouv√®res\\", using the Old French version of the word (for more information on the \\"trouv√®res\\", their poetic forms, extant works and their social status, see the article of that name). The occitan troubadours were amazingly creative in the development of verse forms and poetic genres, but their greatest impact on medieval literature was perhaps in their elaboration of complex code of love and service called \\"fin amors\\" or, more generally, courtly love. The \\"fin amors\\" tradition appears at roughly the same time in Europe as the Cult of the Virgin Mary, and the two have obvious similarities. In the \\"fin amors\\" tradition, the poet pledges his service to his lady (\\"dame\\", usually a married woman), in much the same way a knight or vassal pledges service to his lord. In the poems of the troubadours, the lady is frequently cold, distant, or upset with the poet and demands that he prove his service to her; the poet, for his part, is generally tormented by his passion, and his poems are often desperate pleas to his lady so that she might grant him some favor. In some troubadour poetry, the \\"favor\\" sought for is decidedly sexual, but in others there is a rarefied notion of love as spiritual and moral force. For more information on the troubadour tradition, see Proven√ßal literature. Selected trouv√®re poets of the 12th and 13th centuries: * Conon de B√©thune (c.1150-c.1219) * Le Ch√¢telain de Couci (d.1203) * Blondel de Nesle (second half of the 12th century) * Richard the Lionheart (Richard Coeur de Lion) (1157‚Äì1199) * Gace Brul√© (active 1180‚Äì1213) * Colin Muset (around 1230) * Theobald IV of Champagne (1201‚Äì1253) * Adam de la Halle (c.1240-c.1288) * Guiot de Provins (d. after 1208) By the late 13th century, the poetic tradition in France had begun to develop in ways that differed significantly from the troubadour poets, both in content and in the use of certain fixed forms. The new poetic (as well as musical: some of the earliest medieval music has lyrics composed in Old French by the earliest composers known by name) tendencies are apparent in the Roman de Fauvel in 1310 and 1314, a satire on abuses in the medieval church filled with medieval motets, lais, rondeaux and other new secular forms of poetry and music (mostly anonymous, but with several pieces by Philippe de Vitry who would coin the expression Ars nova [new art, or new technique] to distinguish the new musical practice from the music of the immediately preceding age). The best-known poet and composer of ars nova secular music and chansons was Guillaume de Machaut. (For more on music, see medieval music; for more on music in the period after Machaut, see Renaissance music). Selected French poets from the late 13th to the 15th centuries: * Rutebeuf (d.1285) * Guillaume de Machaut (1300‚Äì1377) * Eustache Deschamps (1346-c.1406) * Alain Chartier (c. 1392 ‚Äì c. 1430) *Christine de Pizan (1364‚Äì1430) * Charles, duc d'Orl√©ans (1394‚Äì1465) * Fran√ßois Villon (1431‚Äì1465?) The last three poets on this list deserve further comment. Charles, duc d'Orl√©ans was a noble and head of one of the most powerful families in France during the Hundred Years' War. Captured in the Battle of Agincourt, he was a prisoner of the English from 1415‚Äì1441 and his ballades often speak of loss and isolation. His son became King Louis XII of France. Christine de Pizan was one of the most prolific writers of her age. Her most famous work is the Book of the City of Ladies, which is considered a foundational feminist text. She is often acknowledged to be the first female professional writer. Over the course of her lifetime, she produced 41 pieces of prose or poetry. She ran her own manuscript workshop and employed women as well as men to be scribes and illuminators. Fran√ßois Villon was a student and vagabond whose two poetic \\"testaments\\" or \\"wills\\" are celebrated for their portrayal of the urban and university environment of Paris and their scabrous wit, satire and verbal puns. The image of Villon as vagabond poet seems to have gained almost mythic status in the 16th century, and this figure would be championed by poetic rebels of the 19th century and 20th centuries (see Po√®te maudit). Poetic forms used by medieval French poets include: * Ballade * Rondeau (or Rondel) * Diti√© * Dits moraux * Lai * Virelai * Pastourelle * Complainte * Chanson ** Chanson de toile (\\"weaving song\\") ** Chanson de croisade ** Chanson courtoise ** Rotrouenge * Chant royal * Aube (\\"dawn poem\\") * Jeu parti Theater Discussions about the origins of non-religious theater (th√©√¢tre profane)‚Äîboth drama and farce‚Äîin the Middle Ages remain controversial, but the idea of a continuous popular tradition stemming from Latin comedy and tragedy to the 9th century seems unlikely. Most historians place the origin of medieval drama in the church's liturgical dialogues and \\"tropes\\". At first simply dramatizations of the ritual, particularly in those rituals connected with Christmas and Easter (see Mystery play), plays were eventually transferred from the monastery church to the chapter house or refectory hall and finally to the open air, and the vernacular was substituted for Latin. In the 12th century one finds the earliest extant passages in French appearing as refrains inserted into liturgical dramas in Latin, such as a Saint Nicholas (patron saint of the student clercs) play and a Saint Stephen play. Dramatic plays in French from the 12th and 13th centuries: * Le Jeu d'Adam (1150‚Äì1160) ‚Äì written in octosyllabic rhymed couplets with Latin stage directions (implying that it was written by Latin-speaking clerics for a lay public) * Le Jeu de Saint Nicolas ‚Äì Jean Bodel ‚Äì written in octosyllabic rhymed couplets * Le Miracle de Th√©ophile ‚Äì Rutebeuf (c.1265) The origins of farce and comic theater remain equally controversial; some literary historians believe in a non-liturgical origin (among \\"jongleurs\\" or in pagan and folk festivals), others see the influence of liturgical drama (some of the dramas listed above include farcical sequences) and monastic readings of Plautus and Latin comic theater. Non-dramatic plays from the 12th and 13th centuries: * Le Dit de l'herberie ‚Äì Rutebeuf * Courtois d'Arras (c.1228) * Le Jeu de la feuill√© (1275) ‚Äì Adam de la Halle * Le Jeu de Robin et de Marion (a pastourelle) (1288) ‚Äì Adam de la Halle * Le Jeu du P√®lerin (1288) * Le Gar√ßon et l'aveugle (1266‚Äì1282) * Aucassin et Nicolette (a chantefable) ‚Äì a mixture of prose and lyrical passages Select list of plays from the 14th and 15th centuries: * La Farce de ma√Ætre Trubert et d'Antrongnard ‚Äì Eustache Deschamps * Le Dit des quatre offices de l'ostel du roy ‚Äì Eustache Deschamps * Miracles de Notre Dame * Bien Avis√© et mal avis√© (morality) (1439) * La Farce de ma√Ætre Pierre Pathelin (1464‚Äì1469) ‚Äì this play had a great influence on Rabelais in the 16th century * Le Franc archer de Bagnolet (1468‚Äì1473) * Moralit√© (1486) ‚Äì Henri Baude * L'Homme p√©cheur (morality) (1494) * La Farce du cuvier * La Farce nouvelle du p√¢t√© et de la tarte In the 15th century, the public representation of plays was organized and controlled by a number of professional and semi-professional guilds: * Clercs de la Basoche (Paris) ‚Äì Morality plays * Enfants sans Souci (Paris) ‚Äì Farces and Sotties * Conards (Rouen) * Confr√©rie de la Passion (Paris) ‚Äì Mystery plays Genres of theater practiced in the Middle Ages in France: * Farce ‚Äì a realistic, humorous, and even coarse satire of human failings * Sottie ‚Äì generally a conversation among idiots (\\"sots\\"), full of puns and quidproquos * Pastourelle ‚Äì a play with a pastoral setting * Chantefable ‚Äì a mixed verse and prose form only found in \\"Aucassin et Nicolette\\" * Mystery play ‚Äì a depiction of the Christian mysteries or Saint's lives * Morality play * Miracle play * Passion play * Sermon Joyeux ‚Äì a burlesque sermon Other forms A large body of fables survive in Old French; these include (mostly anonymous) literature dealing with the recurring trickster character of Reynard the Fox. Marie de France was also active in this genre, producing the Ysopet (Little Aesop) series of fables in verse. Related to the fable was the more bawdy \\"fabliau\\", which covered topics such as cuckolding and corrupt clergy. These \\"fabliaux\\" would be an important source for Chaucer and for the Renaissance short story (\\"conte\\" or \\"nouvelle\\"). Satire was also written during this period, including the Roman de Fauvel, which mocks the sins of humanity by making the Seven Deadly Sins appear in the personification of a horse. The prose satire Les XV [Quinze] joies de mariage (The Fifteen Joys of Marriage, first published 1480‚Äì90, written perhaps in the early 15th century, and attributed variously to Antoine de la Sale, Gilles Bellem√®re the bishop of Avignon, and many others) is a riotous critique of wives (typical of misogynistic literature of the period), but it also provides important insight into the economic and social life of a married household in the 15th century. Prose compositions in the Middle Ages‚Äîother than the prose versions of romances and \\"chansons de geste\\"‚Äîinclude a number of histories and chronicles, of which the most famous are those of Robert de Clari and Geoffroy de Villehardouin (both on the Fourth crusade of 1204 and the capture of Constantinople), Jean de Joinville (on Saint Louis IX of France), Jean Froissart (on the wars of the 14th century) and Philippe de Commines and Enguerrand de Monstrelet (on the troubles of the 15th century). Philippe de M√©zi√®res wrote \\"Songe du Vieil Pelerin\\" (1389), an elaborate allegorical voyage in which he described the customs of Europe and the near East. Livre pour l'enseignement de ses filles du Chevalier de La Tour Landry, where he gives advice to his daughters about a good behavior and vanity's danger, and criticizes the bad behaviors to avoid.

This century of enormous economic, social, intellectual and political transformation produced two important literary and philosophical movements: during what became known as the Age of Enlightenment, the Philosophes questioned all existing institutions, including the church and state, and applied rationalism and scientific analysis to society; and a very different movement, which emerged in reaction to the first movement; the beginnings of Romanticism, which exalted the role of emotion in art and life. In common with a similar movement in England at the same time, the writers of 18th century France were critical, skeptical and innovative. Their lasting contributions were the ideas of liberty, toleration, humanitarianism, equality, and progress, which became the ideals of modern western democracy. Context Louis XV Louis XVI The 18th century saw the gradual weakening of the absolute monarchy constructed by Louis XIV. Its power slipped away during the Regency of Philippe d'Orl√©ans, (1715‚Äì1723) and the long regime of King Louis XV, when France lost the Seven Years' War with England, and lost much of its empire in Canada and India. France was forced to recognize the growing power of England and Prussia. The Monarchy finally ended with King Louis XVI, who was unable to understand or control the forces of the French Revolution. The end of the century saw the birth of the United States, with the help of French ideas and military forces; the declaration of the French Republic in 1792, and the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, setting the stage for the history of modern France Marie Antoinette The Toilet of Venus (1751) typifies the superficially pleasing elegance of Boucher's mature style. The 18th century also brought enormous social changes to France; an enormous growth in population; and, even more important, the growth of the wealthy class, thanks to new technologies (the steam engine, metallurgy), and trade with France's colonies in the New World and India. French society was hierarchal with the Clergy (First Estate) and Nobility (Second Estate) at the top and The Third Estate who included everyone else. Members of the Third Estate, especially the more wealthy and influential, began to challenge the cultural and social monopoly of the aristocracy; French cities began to have their own theaters, coffee houses and salons, independent of the aristocracy. The Rise of the Third Estate was influential in the overthrow of the monarchy in the French Revolution in 1789. French thinking also evolved greatly, thanks to major discoveries in science by Newton, Watt, Volta, Leibniz, Buffon, Lavoisier, and Monge, among others, and their rapid diffusion throughout Europe through newspapers, journals, scientific societies, and theaters. Faith in science and progress was the driving force behind the first French Encyclopedia of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. The authority of the Catholic Church was weakened, partly by the conflicts between high and low clergy, partly by the conflict between the State and Jesuits, who were finally expelled from the Kingdom in 1764. The Protestants achieved legal status in France in 1787. The church hierarchy was in continual battle with the Lumieres, having many of their works banned, and causing French courts to sentence a Protestant, Jean Calas, to death in 1762 for blasphemy, an act which was strongly condemned by Voltaire. The explorations of the New World and the first encounters with American Indians also brought a new theme into French and European Literature; exoticism, and the idea of the Noble Savage, which inspired such works as Paul et Virginie by Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre. The exchange of ideas with other countries also increased. British ideas were particularly important, particularly such ideas as constitutional monarchy and romanticism, which greatly influenced French writers, particularly in the following century. The visual arts of the 18th century were highly decorative and oriented toward giving pleasure, as exemplified by the Regency Style and Louis XV Style, and the paintings of Fran√ßois Boucher, Jean-Honor√© Fragonard, Watteau and Chardin, and portrait painters Quentin de La Tour, Nattier and Van Loo. Toward the end of the century, a more sober style appeared, aimed at illustrating scenery, work, and moral values exemplified by Greuze, Hubert Robert and Claude Joseph Vernet. The leading figures in French music were Fran√ßois Couperin and Jean- Philippe Rameau, but they were overshadowed by other European composers of the century, notably Vivaldi, Mozart Haendel, Bach, and Haydn. For art and architecture in the 18th century, see French Rococo and Neoclassicism The Philosophes and the literature of ideas Fontenelle L'Encyclop√©die Montesquieu Diderot Emmanuel Joseph Siey√®s Continuing the work of the so- called \\"Libertines\\" of the 17th century, and the critical spirit of such writers as Bayle and Fontenelle, (1657‚Äì1757), the writers who were called the lumi√®res denounced, in the name of reason and moral values, the social and political oppressions of their time. They challenged the idea of absolute monarchy and demanded a social contract as the new basis of political authority, and demanded a more democratic organization of central power in a constitutional monarchy, with a separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government (Montesquieu, Diderot, and Rousseau.)Rousseau wrote \\"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains\\", in the Social Contract (1762). The idea was adapted by Thomas Jefferson 14 years later in the American Declaration of Independence. Voltaire fought against the abuses of power by the government, such as censorship and letters of cachet, which allowed imprisonment without trial, against the collusion of the church and monarchy, and for an \\"enlightened despotism\\" where kings would be advised by philosophers.Voltaire wrote, \\"It is better to risk saving a guilty person than to condemn an innocent one.\\" (Zadig, 1747, ch.6.) These writers, and others such as the Abb√© Siey√®s, one of the main authors of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, became known as the philosophes. They came from the wealthy upper class or Third Estate, sought a society founded upon talent and merit, rather than a society based on heredity or caste. Their ideas were strongly influenced by those of John Locke in England. They introduced the values of liberty and equality which became the ideals of the French Republic founded at the end of the century.It was Montesquieu who composed the classical definition of liberty: \\"Liberty consists of being able to do what you want to do, and not being forced to do what you do not want to do.\\" (Of the Spirit of the Laws) In the same work he added, \\"Liberty is the right to do all that the laws allow.\\" They defended the freedom of conscience and challenged the role of religious institutions in society. For them, tolerance was a fundamental value of society. When the Convention placed the ashes of Voltaire in the Pantheon in Paris, they honored him as the man who \\"taught us to live as free men.\\" While the philosophes had widely different approaches, they all had as a common objective, both for humanity and for individuals, the ideal of happiness (bonheur). Some, like Rousseau, dreamed of the happiness of the noble savage, rapidly disappearing; others, like Voltaire, sought happiness in a life of the worldly pursuit of refinement. The philosophes were optimists, and they saw their mission clearly; they did not simply observe, but agitated ceaselessly for the achievement of their goals. The important works of the philosophes belonged to a variety of different genres, such as the tale illustrating a particular philosophical point;(Zadig (1747) or Candide (1759), both by Voltaire in 1759); or satire on French life disguised as letters from an exotic country (Lettres persanes by Montesquieu in 1721); or essays (The Spirit of the Laws by Montesquieu in 1748, An Essay on Tolerance by Voltaire in 1763; The Social Contract by Rousseau in 1762; The Supplement to a voyage of Bougainville by Diderot, or The History of the Two Indias by the Abb√© Guillaume-Thomas Raynal). The comedies of Marivaux and of Beaumarchais also played a part in this debate about and diffusion of great ideas. The monumental work of the philosophes was the Encyclop√©die ou Dictionnaire raisonn√© des sciences, des arts et des m√©tiers, the famous encyclopedia of Diderot and d'Alembert, published in thirty-five volumes, with texts and illustration, from 1750 until 1772, accompanied by a large variety of essays, speeches, dialogues and interviews on all aspects of knowledge.\\"Nothing is more indisputable than the existence of our senses\\", Jean Le Rond d'Alembert wrote in the preliminary discourse of Volume One of the Encyclopedia, setting the tone for the systematic examination of all knowledge that followed.  French theater in the 18th century  Voltaire at 24 Beaumarchais Marivaux The great French playwrights of the 17th century, Moli√®re, Racine and Corneille, continued to exert a great influence on the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, but new life was brought into French theater by the tragedies of Voltaire, which introduced modern themes while keeping the classical forms of the alexandrine, as in the play Za√Øre in 1732, and The Fanaticism of Mohamet in 1741, both of which enjoyed great success. Nonetheless, royal censorship was still active in the theater under King Louis XV and Louis XVI, and, despite his popularity, Beaumarchais had great difficulty getting his play The Marriage of Figaro staged in Paris, because of its political message.In 1784, a performance of The Marriage of Figaro was forbidden at Versailles, so it was performed instead at a private theater. One reason for the ban was a monologue by Figaro to his master, saying, \\"Because you are a great lord, you believe that you are a great genius! Nobility, fortune, rank, places, all that makes you so proud! But what have you done for so many advantages? You took the pain of being born, that's all - as for the rest, you are a rather ordinary man.\\" Quoted in Marco Ferro, Histoire de France pg. 201. The relaxing of morals under the French Regency brought the return in 1716 of the Com√©die-Italienne, which had been driven out of Paris under Louis XIV. It also saw a period of great theatrical spectacles; crowds went to the theater to see famous actors and to laugh at the characters introduced by the Italian commedia dell'arte, such as Harlequin, Columbine and Pantalone. This was the genre used by Marivaux (1688‚Äì1763), with comedies which combined a perceptive analysis of the sentiments of love, subtle verbal play, and an analysis of the problems of society, all done through a clever use of the relationship between the master and his valet. His major works include Les Fausses Confidences (1737), le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard (1730), and l'√éle des esclaves (1725).\\"In this world\\", Merivaux wrote, \\"you must be a bit too kind in order to be kind enough.\\" (Le Jeu de l'Amour et du Hasard, 1730. act 1, scene 2.) Jean-Fran√ßois Regnard and Alain-Ren√© Lesage (1668‚Äì1747) also had great success with comedies of manners, such as Regnard's Le L√©gataire universel, and Lesage's Turcaret in 1709. But the greatest author of French comedies in the 18th century was Beaumarchais (1732‚Äì1799), who displayed a mastery of dialogue and intrigue combined with social and political satire through the character of Figaro, a valet who challenges the power of his master, who is featured in two major works; le Barbier de S√©ville (1775) and le Mariage de Figaro (1784). The theater of the 18th century also introduced two new genres, now considered minor, which both strongly influenced the French theater in the following century; the \\"Comedy of Tears\\" (com√©die larmoyante) and the bourgeois drama (drame bourgeois) which told stories full of pathos in a realistic setting, and which concerned the lives of bourgeois families, rather than aristocrats. Some popular examples of these genres were the Le Fils naturel (The Natural Son) by Diderot in 1757; Le P√®re de famille (The Father of the Family) by Diderot in 1758; Le Philosophe sans le savoir (The Philosopher who did not know he was a Philosopher) by Michel- Jean Sedaine, (1765); La Brouette du vinaigrier (The Vinegar Cart) by Louis- S√©bastien Mercier (1775); and La M√®re Coupable (The Guilty Mother) by Beaumarchais, (1792). The 18th century also saw the development of new forms of musical theater, such as the vaudeville theater, and the op√©ra comique, as well as a new genre of literary writing about theater, such as Diderot's Paradoxe sur le com√©dien; the writings of Voltaire defending theater actors against the condemnation of the church; and Rousseau's condemnation of immorality in the theater. The French novel in the 18th century Antoine Fran√ßois Pr√©vost Candide First page of the 1753 edition of Manon Lescaut. Pierre Ambroise Choderlos de Laclos Jacques-Henri Bernardin The novel in the 18th century saw innovations in form and content which opened the way for the modern novel, a work of fiction in prose recounting the adventures or the evolution of one or several characters. In the 18th century the genre of the novel enjoyed a great increase in readership, and was marked by the effort to convey feelings realistically, through such literary devices as first-person narration, exchanges of letters, and dialogues, all trying to show, in the spirit of the lumieres, a society which was evolving. The French novel was strongly influenced by the English novel, through the translation of the works of Samuel Richardson, Jonathan Swift, and Daniel Defoe.\\"There exists one book\\", Rousseau wrote, \\"which, to my taste, furnishes the happiest treatise of natural education. What then is this marvelous book? Is it Aristotle? Pliny? Is it Buffon? No - it is Robinson Crusoe.' (Emile, ou De l'education (1762). The novel of the 18th century explored all the potential devices of a novel - different points of view, surprise twists of the plot, engaging the reader, careful psychological analysis, realistic descriptions of the setting, imagination, and attention to form. The texts of the period are difficult to neatly divide into categories, but they can loosely be divided into several subgenres. = The philosophical tale = This category includes the contes philosophiques of Voltaire, Zadig (1747) and Candide (1759), and also the later novella, l'Ing√©nu, (1768) in which Voltaire moved away from fantasy and introduced a large part of social and psychological realism. = The realistic novel = This subgenre combined social realism with stories about men and women looking for love. Examples include la Vie de Marianne (1741), and Le Paysan parvenu (1735) by Marivaux; Manon Lescaut (1731) by the abb√© Antoine Fran√ßois Pr√©vost (1731) and Le Paysan perverti (The Perverse Peasant) (1775), a novel in the form of letters by Nicolas-Edme R√©tif (1734‚Äì1806). Within this subgenre is a sub-subgenre of realistic novels about love influenced by Spanish literature; novels full of satire, a variety of different social milieux, and young men learning their way in the new world. The classic example is Histoire de Gil Blas de Santillane by Alain-Ren√© Lesage (1715). = The novel of the imagination = The novel of the imagination pictured life centuries in the future; L'An 2440, r√™ve s'il en fut jamais (The year 2440 - dream of all dreams) by Mercier (1771); or stories of fantasy le Diable amoureux (The Devil in Love) of Jacques Cazotte (1772). = The libertine, or erotic novel = The libertine, or erotic novel, featured eroticism, seduction, manipulation, and social intrigue. Classic examples are Les Liaisons dangereuses (Dangerous Liaisons) by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos (1782); (Justine ou les Malheurs de la vertu (Justine or the misfortunes of virtue) by Donatien Alphonse Fran√ßois de Sade (the Marquis de Sade) (1797); Le Sopha- conte moral ) (The Sopha - a moral tale) by Claude Prosper Jolyot de Cr√©billon (1745), and les Bijoux indiscrets (The indiscreet jewels) (1748) and La Religieuse (The Nun) by Diderot (1760). = The novel of feelings = The novel of feelings appeared in the second half of the 18th century, with the publication of Julie ou la Nouvelle H√©lo√Øse (Julie, or the New Heloise), in a novel in the form of letters, written by Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1761). It was modelled after the English novel Pamela by Samuel Richardson, which was the best-selling novel of the century, drawing readers by its pre-romantic depiction of nature and romantic love. Another popular example was Paul et Virginie by Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (1787). = The novel broken apart = The romans √©clat√©s, roughly translated \\"Novels broken apart\\", such as Jacques le fataliste et son ma√Ætre (Eng: Jacques the Fatalist and His Master) (1773) and le Neveu de Rameau (Eng: The Nephew of Rameau) (1762) by Diderot are almost impossible to classify, but resemble the modernist novels that would come a century or more later. The birth of the autobiography in the 18th century Literary stories of people's lives were popular throughout the 18th century, with such popular books as la Vie de mon p√®re (Eng: The Life of My Father) (1779) and Monsieur Nicolas (1794) by Nicolas-Edme R√©tif, but the success of the century was Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who founded the genre of the modern autobiography with les R√™veries du promeneur solitaire (The dreams of a solitary walker) in 1776, and Les Confessions in 1782, which became the models for all novels of self-discovery. French poetry of the 18th century Andr√© Ch√©nier. Voltaire used verse with great skill in his Po√®me sur le d√©sastre de Lisbonne (Poem on the Lisbon Disaster) and in le Mondain (The Man About Town), but his poetry was in the classical school of the 17th century. Only a few French poets of the 18th century have an enduring reputation; they include Jacques Delille (1738‚Äì1813), for les Jardins (The Gardens), in 1782; and √âvariste de Parny (1753‚Äì1814) for √âl√©gies in 1784, who both contributed to the birth of romanticism and to the poetry of nature and nostalgia. The poet of the 18th century best-known today is Andr√© Ch√©nier (1762‚Äì1794), who created an expressive style in his famous la Jeune Tarentine (The Young Tarentine) and la Jeune Captive (The Young Captive), both published only in 1819, long after his death during the Terror of the French Revolution. Fabre d'√âglantine was known both for his songs, such as Il pleut, il pleut, berg√®re) (It's raining, shepherdess) and for his participation in the writing of the new French Republican Calendar created during the French Revolution.  Other genres of 18th century French literature  Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, by Fran√ßois-Hubert Drouais. Saint-Just. Robespierre Georges-Jacques Danton * The genre of modern art criticism was launched by Diderot in Salons, in which he analyzed the way emotions could be created by works of art, using the example of the feelings inspired by the poetic ruins painted by Hubert Robert. * Georges-Louis Leclerc, Count of Buffon, popularized the scientific discoveries of his century with the massive Histoire naturelle (Natural History), published with great success between 1749 and 1789. * During the French Revolution, political speeches became a popular genre of literature with the publication of the speeches of such talented orators as Honor√© Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, Louis Antoine de Saint-Just, Georges Danton and Maximilien Robespierre. Conclusions French literature in the 18th century offered a rich collection of works in all genres, and brought together, rather than opposed, the philosophical and analytical views of the Philosophes and Lumieres with the more subjective and personal views of the emerging romantic movement. Many of the works of the 18th century are forgotten, but the century also produced a number of writers who were great both for the originality and importance of their ideas and for their literary talent; writers such as Voltaire, Rousseau, Montesquieu, Diderot and Beaumarchais, whose ideas are still quoted today. They used their novels and plays as weapons which profoundly changed their society, while expressing their own personalities and feelings. Thanks largely to these writers, in the 18th century French became the language of culture, political and social reform all across Europe, and as far away as America and Russia.The works of Montesquieu and Rousseau were sources for Thomas Jefferson and the other founders of the United States, while Voltaire's ideas were first welcomed and then violently rejected by Russian Empress Catherine the Great.

The period covered spans the following political regimes: Napoleon Bonaparte's Consulate (1799‚Äì1804) and Empire (1804‚Äì1814), the Restoration under Louis XVIII and Charles X (1814‚Äì1830), the July Monarchy under Louis Philippe d'Orl√©ans (1830‚Äì1848), the Second Republic (1848‚Äì1852), the Second Empire under Napoleon III (1852‚Äì1871), and the first decades of the Third Republic (1871‚Äì1940). Overview French literature enjoyed enormous international prestige and success in the 19th century. The first part of the century was dominated by Romanticism, until around the mid-century Realism emerged, at least partly as a reaction. In the last half of the century, \\"naturalism\\", \\"parnassian\\" poetry, and \\"symbolism\\", among other styles, were often competing tendencies at the same time. Some writers did form into literary groups defined by a name and a program or manifesto. In other cases, these expressions were merely pejorative terms given by critics to certain writers or have been used by modern literary historians to group writers of divergent projects or methods. Nevertheless, these labels can be useful in describing broad historical developments in the arts. Romanticism French literature from the first half of the century was dominated by Romanticism, which is associated with such authors as Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, p√®re, Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand, Alphonse de Lamartine, G√©rard de Nerval, Charles Nodier, Alfred de Musset, Th√©ophile Gautier and Alfred de Vigny. Their influence was felt in theatre, poetry, prose fiction. The effect of the romantic movement would continue to be felt in the latter half of the century in diverse literary developments, such as \\"realism\\", \\"symbolism\\", and the so- called fin de si√®cle \\"decadent\\" movement. French romanticism used forms such as the historical novel, the romance, the \\"roman noir\\" or Gothic novel; subjects like traditional myths (including the myth of the romantic hero), nationalism, the natural world (i.e. elegies by lakes), and the common man; and the styles of lyricism, sentimentalism, exoticism and orientalism. Foreign influences played a big part in this, especially those of Shakespeare, Sir Walter Scott, Byron, Goethe, and Friedrich Schiller. French Romanticism had ideals diametrically opposed to French classicism and the classical unities, but it could also express a profound loss for aspects of the pre-revolutionary world in a society now dominated by money and fame, rather than honor. Key ideas from early French Romanticism: * \\"Le vague des passions\\" (vagueness, uncertainty of sentiment and passion): Chateaubriand maintained that while the imagination was rich, the world was cold and empty, and civilization had only robbed men of their illusions; nevertheless, a notion of sentiment and passion continued to haunt men. * \\"Le mal du si√®cle\\" (the pain of the century): a sense of loss, disillusion, and aporia, typified by melancholy and lassitude. Romanticism in England and Germany largely predate French romanticism, although there was a kind of \\"pre-romanticism\\" in the works of Senancour and Jean-Jacques Rousseau (among others) at the end of the 18th century. French Romanticism took definite form in the works of Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand and Benjamin Constant and in Madame de Sta√´l's interpretation of Germany as the land of romantic ideals. It found early expression also in the sentimental poetry of Alphonse de Lamartine. The major battles of romanticism in France were in the theater. The early years of the century were marked by a revival of classicism and classical-inspired tragedies, often with themes of national sacrifice or patriotic heroism in keeping with the spirit of the Revolution, but the production of Victor Hugo's Hernani in 1830 marked the triumph of the romantic movement on the stage (a description of the turbulent opening night can be found in Th√©ophile Gautier). The dramatic unities of time and place were abolished, tragic and comic elements appeared together and metrical freedom was won. Marked by the plays of Friedrich Schiller, the romantics often chose subjects from historic periods (the French Renaissance, the reign of Louis XIII of France) and doomed noble characters (rebel princes and outlaws) or misunderstood artists (Vigny's play based on the life of Thomas Chatterton). Victor Hugo was the outstanding genius of the Romantic School and its recognized leader. He was prolific alike in poetry, drama, and fiction. Other writers associated with the movement were the austere and pessimistic Alfred de Vigny, Th√©ophile Gautier a devotee of beauty and creator of the \\"Art for art's sake\\" movement, and Alfred de Musset, who best exemplifies romantic melancholy. All three also wrote novels and short stories, and Musset won a belated success with his plays. Alexandre Dumas, p√®re wrote The Three Musketeers and other romantic novels in an historical setting. Prosper M√©rim√©e and Charles Nodier were masters of shorter fiction. Charles Augustin Sainte- Beuve, a literary critic, showed romantic expansiveness in his hospitality to all ideas and in his unfailing endeavour to understand and interpret authors rather than to judge them. Romanticism is associated with a number of literary salons and groups: the Arsenal (formed around Charles Nodier at the Arsenal Library in Paris from 1824-1844 where Nodier was administrator), the C√©nacle (formed around Nodier, then Hugo from 1823‚Äì1828), the salon of Louis Charles Delescluze, the salon of Antoine (or Antony Deschamps), the salon of Madame de Sta√´l. Romanticism in France defied political affiliation: one finds both \\"liberal\\" (like Stendhal), \\"conservative\\" (like Chateaubriand) and socialist (George Sand) strains. Realism The expression \\"Realism\\", when being applied to literature of the 19th century, implies the attempt to depict contemporary life and society. The growth of realism is linked to the development of science (especially biology), history and the social sciences and to the growth of industrialism and commerce. The \\"realist\\" tendency is not necessarily anti-romantic; romanticism in France often affirmed the common man and the natural setting, as in the peasant stories of George Sand, and concerned itself with historical forces and periods, as in the work of historian Jules Michelet. The novels of Stendhal, including The Red and the Black and The Charterhouse of Parma, address issues of their contemporary society while also using themes and characters derived from the romantic movement. Honor√© de Balzac is the most prominent representative of 19th century realism in fiction. His La Com√©die humaine, a vast collection of nearly 100 novels, was the most ambitious scheme ever devised by a writer of fiction‚Äînothing less than a complete contemporary history of his countrymen. Realism also appears in the works of Alexandre Dumas, fils. Many of the novels in this period, including Balzac's, were published in newspapers in serial form, and the immensely popular realist \\"roman feuilleton\\" tended to specialize in portraying the hidden side of urban life (crime, police spies, criminal slang), as in the novels of Eug√®ne Sue. Similar tendencies appeared in the theatrical melodramas of the period and, in an even more lurid and gruesome light, in the Grand Guignol at the end of the century. Gustave Flaubert's great novels Madame Bovary (1857)‚Äîwhich reveals the tragic consequences of romanticism on the wife of a provincial doctor‚Äîand Sentimental Education represent perhaps the highest stages in the development of French realism, while Flaubert's romanticism is apparent in his fantastic The Temptation of Saint Anthony and the baroque and exotic scenes of ancient Carthage in Salammb√¥. In addition to melodramas, popular and bourgeois theater in the mid-century turned to realism in the \\"well-made\\" bourgeois farces of Eug√®ne Marin Labiche and the moral dramas of √âmile Augier. Naturalism From the 1860s on, critics increasingly speak of literary \\"Naturalism\\". The expression is imprecise, and was frequently used disparagingly to characterize authors whose chosen subject matter was taken from the working classes and who portrayed the misery and harsh conditions of real life. Many of the \\"naturalist\\" writers took a radical position against the excesses of romanticism and strove to use scientific and encyclopedic precision in their novels (Zola spent months visiting coal mines for his Germinal, and even the arch-realist Flaubert was famous for his years of research for historical details). Hippolyte Taine supplied much of the philosophy of naturalism: he believed that every human being was determined by the forces of heredity and environment and by the time in which he lived. The influence of certain Norwegian, Swedish and Russian writers gave an added impulse to the naturalistic movement. The novels and short stories of Guy de Maupassant are often tagged with the label \\"naturalist\\", although he clearly followed the realist model of his teacher and mentor, Flaubert. Maupassant used elements derived from the gothic novel in stories like Le Horla. This tension between portrayal of the contemporary world in all its sordidness, detached irony and the use of romantic images and themes would also influence the symbolists (see below) and would continue to the 20th century. Naturalism is most often associated with the novels of √âmile Zola in particular his Les Rougon-Macquart novel cycle, which includes Germinal, L'Assommoir, Nana, Le Ventre de Paris, La B√™te humaine, and L'≈íuvre (The Masterpiece), in which the social success or failure of two branches of a family is explained by physical, social and hereditary laws. Other writers who have been labeled naturalists include: Alphonse Daudet, Jules Vall√®s, Joris-Karl Huysmans (later a leading \\"decadent\\" and rebel against naturalism),Read Bernard Bonnejean \\"Huysmans avant √Ä Rebours : les fondements n√©cessaires d'une qu√™te en devenir\\", in Le Mal dans l'imaginaire fran√ßais (1850-1950), √©d. David et L'Harmattan, 1998 () ; \\"Huysmans before A Rebours: The necessary foundation for a quest to become\\", The evil in the French imaginary (1850‚Äì1950), Ed. David and L'Harmattan, 1998 () Edmond de Goncourt and his brother Jules de Goncourt, and (in a very different vein) Paul Bourget. Parnasse An attempt to be objective was made in poetry by the group of writers known as the Parnassians‚Äîwhich included Leconte de Lisle, Th√©odore de Banville, Catulle Mend√®s, Sully-Prudhomme, Fran√ßois Copp√©e, Jos√© Mar√≠a de Heredia and (early in his career) Paul Verlaine‚Äîwho (using Th√©ophile Gautier's notion of art for art's sake and the pursuit of the beautiful) strove for exact and faultless workmanship, and selected exotic and classical subjects which they treated with a rigidity of form and an emotional detachment (elements of which echo the philosophical work of Arthur Schopenhauer whose aesthetic theories would also have an influence on the symbolists). Modern science and geography were united with romantic adventure in the works of Jules Verne and other writers of popular serial adventure novels and early science-fiction. Symbolism and the birth of the Modern The naturalist tendency to see life without illusions and to dwell on its more depressing and sordid aspects appears in an intensified degree in the immensely influential poetry of Charles Baudelaire, but with profoundly romantic elements derived from the Byronic myth of the anti-hero and the romantic poet, and the world-weariness of the \\"mal du si√®cle\\", etc. Similar elements occur in the novels of Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly. The poetry of Baudelaire and much of the literature in the latter half of the century (or \\"fin de si√®cle\\") were often characterized as \\"decadent\\" for their lurid content or moral vision. In a similar vein, Paul Verlaine used the expression \\"po√®te maudit\\" (\\"accursed poet\\") in 1884 to refer to a number of poets like Tristan Corbi√®re, St√©phane Mallarm√© and Arthur Rimbaud who had fought against poetic conventions and suffered social rebuke or had been ignored by the critics. But with the publication of Jean Mor√©as Symbolist Manifesto in 1886, it was the term symbolism which was most often applied to the new literary environment. The writers St√©phane Mallarm√©, Paul Verlaine, Paul Val√©ry, Joris- Karl Huysmans, Arthur Rimbaud, Jules Laforgue, Jean Mor√©as, Gustave Kahn, Albert Samain, Jean Lorrain, R√©my de Gourmont, Pierre Lou√øs, Tristan Corbi√®re, Henri de R√©gnier, Villiers de l'Isle-Adam, Stuart Merrill, Ren√© Ghil, Saint- Pol-Roux, Oscar-Vladislas de Milosz, Albert Giraud, Emile Verhaeren, Georges Rodenbach and Maurice Maeterlinck and others have been called symbolists, although each author's personal literary project was unique. The symbolists often share themes that parallel Schopenhauer's aesthetics and notions of will, fatality and unconscious forces. The symbolists often used themes of sex (often through the figure of the prostitute), the city, irrational phenomena (delirium, dreams, narcotics, alcohol), and sometimes a vaguely medieval setting. The tone of symbolism is highly variable, at times realistic, imaginative, ironic or detached, although on the whole the symbolists did not stress moral or ethical ideas. In poetry, the symbolist procedure‚Äîas typified by Paul Verlaine‚Äîwas to use subtle suggestion instead of precise statement (rhetoric was banned) and to evoke moods and feelings by the magic of words and repeated sounds and the cadence of verse (musicality) and metrical innovation. Some symbolists explored the use of free verse. The use of leitmotifs, medieval settings and the notion of the complete work of art (blending music, visuals and language) in the works of the German composer Richard Wagner also had a profound impact on these writers. St√©phane Mallarm√©'s profound interest in the limits of language as an attempt at describing the world, and his use of convoluted syntax, and in his last major poem Un coup de d√©s, the spacing, size and position of words on the page were important modern breakthroughs that continue to preoccupy contemporary poetry in France. Arthur Rimbaud's prose poem collection Illuminations are among the first free verse poems in French; his biographically inspired poem Une saison en enfer (A Season in Hell) was championed by the Surrealists as a revolutionary modern literary act (the same work would play an important role in the New York City punk scene in the 1970s). The infernal images of the prose poem \\"Les Chants de Maldoror\\" by Isidore Ducasse, Comte de Lautr√©amont would have a similar impact. The crisis of language and meaning in Mallarm√© and the radical vision of literature, life and the political world in Rimbaud are to some degree the cornerstones of the \\"modern\\" and the radical experiments of Dada, Surrealism and Theatre of the Absurd (to name a few) in the 20th century.

For literature made after 1999, see the article Contemporary French literature. Many of the developments in French literature in this period parallel changes in the visual arts. For more on this, see French art of the 20th century. Overview French literature was profoundly shaped by the historical events of the century and was also shaped by‚Äîand a contributor to‚Äîthe century's political, philosophical, moral, and artistic crises. This period spans the last decades of the Third Republic (1871‚Äì1940) (including World War I), the period of World War II (the German occupation and the Vichy‚Äì1944), the provisional French government (1944‚Äì1946) the Fourth Republic (1946‚Äì1958) and the Fifth Republic (1959-). Important historical events for French literature include: the Dreyfus Affair; French colonialism and imperialism in Africa, the Far East (French Indochina) and the Pacific; the Algerian War of Independence (1954‚Äì1962); the important growth of the French Communist Party; the rise of Fascism in Europe; the events of May 1968. For more on French history, see History of France. Twentieth century French literature did not undergo an isolated development and reveals the influence of writers and genres from around the world, including Walt Whitman, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Franz Kafka, John Dos Passos, Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, Luigi Pirandello, the British and American detective novel, James Joyce, Jorge Luis Borges, Bertolt Brecht and many others. In turn, French literature has also had a radical impact on world literature. Because of the creative spirit of the French literary and artistic movements at the beginning of the century, France gained the reputation as being the necessary destination for writers and artists. Important foreign writers who have lived and worked in France (especially Paris) in the twentieth century include: Oscar Wilde, Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, William S. Burroughs, Henry Miller, Ana√Øs Nin, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, Julio Cort√°zar, Vladimir Nabokov, Edith Wharton and Eug√®ne Ionesco. Some of the most important works of the century in French were written by foreign authors (Eug√®ne Ionesco, Samuel Beckett). For Americans in the 1920s and 1930s (including the so-called \\"Lost Generation\\"), part of the fascination with France was also linked to freedom from Prohibition. For African-Americans in the twentieth century (such as James Baldwin), France was also more accepting of race and permitted greater freedom (in a similar way, Jazz was embraced by the French faster than in some areas in America). A similar sense of freedom from political oppression or from intolerance (such as anti-homosexual discrimination) has drawn other authors and writers to France. France has also been more permissive in terms of censorship, and many important foreign language novels were originally published in France while being banned in America: Joyce's Ulysses (published by Sylvia Beach in Paris, 1922), Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita and William S. Burroughs's Naked Lunch (both published by Olympia Press), and Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer (published by Obelisk Press). From 1895 to 1914 The early years of the century (often called the \\"Belle √©poque\\") saw radical experiments in all genres and Symbolism and Naturalism underwent profound changes. Alfred Jarry united symbolism with elements from marionette theater and a kind of proto-surrealism. The stage was further radicalised both in the direction of expressionism (the \\"th√©√¢tre de l'oeuvre\\" of Aur√©lien Lugn√©-Poe) and hyper-realism (the theater of Andr√© Antoine). The theater director Jacques Copeau emphasized training an actor to be a complete person and rejected the Italian stage for something closer to the Elizabethan model, and his vision would have a profound impact on the \\"Cartel\\" of the 1920s and 1930s (see below). Guillaume Apollinaire radicalized the Baudelairian poetic exploration of modern life in evoking planes, the Eiffel Tower and urban wastelands, and he brought poetry into contact with cubism through his Calligrammes, a form of visual poetry. Inspired by Rimbaud, Paul Claudel used a form of free verse to explore his mystical conversion to Catholicism. Other poets from this period include: Paul Val√©ry, Max Jacob (a key member of the group around Apollinaire), Pierre Jean Jouve (a follower of Romain Rolland's \\"Unanism\\"), Valery Larbaud (a translator of Whitman and friend to Joyce), Victor Segalen (friend to Huysmans and Claudel), L√©on-Paul Fargue (who studied with St√©phane Mallarm√© and was close to Val√©ry and Larbaud). In the novel, Andr√© Gide's early works, especially L'Immoraliste (1902), pursue the problems of freedom and sensuality that symbolism had posed; Alain-Fournier's novel Le Grand Meaulnes is a deeply felt portrait of a nostalgic past. But radical experimentation was not appreciated by all literary and artistic circles in the early 20th century. Popular and bourgeois tastes were relatively conservative. The poetic dramas of Edmond Rostand, especially Cyrano de Bergerac in 1897, were immensely popular at the start of the 20th century, as too the \\"well-made\\" plays and bourgeois farces of Georges Feydeau. Anatole France, Maurice Barr√®s, Paul Bourget were leading authors of the period who employed fiction as a convenient vehicle for ideas about men and things. The tradition of the Balzac and Zola inspired roman-fleuve continued to exert a profound attraction, as in Romain Rolland's Jean- Christophe (1906‚Äì1912). Paul L√©autaud (1872-1956) was the author of a highly original personal diary chronicling the life of the Parisian literary world in the first half of the 20th century in his monumental 13-volume \\"Journal Litt√©raire\\", considered to be \\"the greatest study of character ever written\\" by Mavis Gallant, and \\"more devastating in its truthfulness than the Confessions of Rousseau\\" by his biographer Dr James Harding. Popular fiction and genre fiction at the start of the 20th century also included detective fiction, like the mysteries of the author and journalist Gaston Leroux who is credited with the first \\"locked-room puzzle\\" -- The Mystery of the Yellow Room, featuring the amateur detective Joseph Rouletabille (1908) -- and the immensely popular The Phantom of the Opera (1910). Maurice Leblanc also rose to prominence with the adventures of gentleman-thief Arsene Lupin, who has gained a popularity akin to Sherlock Holmes in the Anglophone world. From 1914 to 1945 = Dada and Surrealism = The First World War generated even more radical tendencies. The Dada movement‚Äîwhich began in a caf√© in Switzerland in 1916‚Äîcame to Paris in 1920, but by 1924 the writers around Paul √âluard, Andr√© Breton, Louis Aragon and Robert Desnos‚Äîheavily influenced by Sigmund Freud's notion of the unconscious‚Äîhad modified dada provocation into Surrealism. In writing and in the visual arts, and by using automatic writing, creative games (like the cadavre exquis) and altered states (through alcohol and narcotics), the surrealists tried to reveal the workings of the unconscious mind. The group championed previous writers they saw as radical (Arthur Rimbaud, the Comte de Lautr√©amont, Baudelaire, Raymond Roussel) and promoted an anti-bourgeois philosophy (particularly with regards to sex and politics) which would later lead most of them to join the communist party. Other writers associated with surrealism include: Jean Cocteau, Ren√© Crevel, Jacques Pr√©vert, Jules Supervielle, Benjamin P√©ret, Philippe Soupault, Pierre Reverdy, Antonin Artaud (who revolutionized theater), Henri Michaux and Ren√© Char. The surrealist movement would continue to be a major force in experimental writing and the international art world until the Second World War. The surrealists technique was particularly well suited for poetry and theater, although Breton, Aragon and Cocteau wrote longer prose works as well, such as Breton's novel Nadja. = Influence and dissidence = The influence of surrealism will be of great importance on poets like Saint-John Perse or Edmond Jab√®s, for example. Others, such as Georges Bataille, created their own movement and group in reaction. The Swiss writer Blaise Cendrars was close to Apollinaire, Pierre Reverdy, Max Jacob and the artists Chagall and L√©ger, and his work has similarities with both surrealism and cubism. = Novel = In the first half of the century the genre of the novel also went through further changes. Louis-Ferdinand C√©line's novels‚Äîsuch as Voyage au bout de la nuit (Journey to the End of Night) -- used an elliptical, oral, and slang-derived style to rail against the hypocrisies and moral lapses of his generation (his anti-semitic tracts in the 1940s, however, led to his condemnation for collaboration). Georges Bernanos's novels used other formal techniques (like the \\"journal form\\") to further psychological exploration. Psychological analysis was also central to Fran√ßois Mauriac's novels, although he would come to be seen by Sartre as representative of an outdated fatalism. Jules Romains's 27-volume novel Les Hommes de bonne volont√© (1932‚Äì1946), Roger Martin du Gard's eight-part novel cycle The Thibaults (1922‚Äì1940), and Marcel Proust's seven-part masterpiece √Ä la recherche du temps perdu (In Search of Lost Time, 1913‚Äì1927) expanded on the roman-fleuve model. Andr√© Gide continued to experiment with the novel, and his most sophisticated exploration of the limits of the traditional novel is found in The Counterfeiters, a novel ostensibly about a writer trying to write a novel. = Theater = Theater in the 1920s and 1930s went through further changes in a loose association of theaters (called the \\"Cartel\\") around the directors and producers Louis Jouvet, Charles Dullin, Gaston Baty and Ludmila and Georges Pito√´ff. They produced works by the French writers Jean Giraudoux, Jules Romains, Jean Anouilh, Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre, and also of Greek and Shakespearean theater, and works by Luigi Pirandello, Anton Chekhov and George Bernard Shaw. Antonin Artaud 1896-1948 as a poet and playwright revolutions the concept of language, and changes the history and practice of theater. = Existentialism = In the late 1930s, the works of Hemingway, Faulkner and Dos Passos came to be translated into French, and their prose style had a profound impact on the work of writers like Jean-Paul Sartre, Andr√© Malraux and Albert Camus. Sartre, Camus, Malraux and Simone de Beauvoir (who is also famous as one of the forerunners of Feminist writing) are often called \\"existentialist writers\\", a reference to Sartre's philosophy of Existentialism (although Camus refused the title \\"existentialist\\"). Sartre's theater, novels and short stories often show individuals forced to confront their freedom or doomed for their refusal to act. Malraux's novels of Spain and China during the civil wars confront individual action with historical forces. Similar issues appear in the novels of Henri Troyat. = In the French colonies = The 1930s and 1940s saw significant contributions by citizens of French colonies, as Albert Camus or Aim√© C√©saire, the latter whom created, along with L√©opold S√©dar Senghor and L√©on Damas the literary review L'√âtudiant Noir, which was a forerunner of the N√©gritude movement. Literature after World War II The 1950s and 1960s were highly turbulent times in France: despite a dynamic economy (\\"les trente glorieuses\\" or \\"30 Glorious Years\\"), the country was torn by their colonial heritage (Vietnam and Indochina, Algeria), by their collective sense of guilt from the Vichy Regime, by their desire for renewed national prestige (Gaullism), and by conservative social tendencies in education and industry. The works, positions and thinking of Albert Camus are also emblematic of a reckoning in the French intellectual circles of post World War II, signaling the moral imperative to distance from Communism. Inspired by the theatrical experiments in the early half of the century and by the horrors of the war, the so-called avant-garde Parisian theater, \\"New Theater\\" or \\"Theatre of the Absurd\\" around the writers Eug√®ne Ionesco, Samuel Beckett, Jean Genet, Arthur Adamov, Fernando Arrabal refused simple explanations and abandoned traditional characters, plots and staging. Other experiments in theatre involved decentralisation, regional theater, \\"popular theater\\" (designed to bring working classes to the theater), and theater heavily influenced by Bertolt Brecht (largely unknown in France before 1954), and the productions of Arthur Adamov and Roger Planchon. The Avignon festivalfestival-avignon.com was started in 1947 by Jean Vilar who was also important in the creation of the T.N.P. or \\"Th√©√¢tre National Populaire.\\" The French novel from the 1950s on went through a similar experimentation in the group of writers published by \\"Les √âditions de Minuit\\", a French publisher; this \\"Nouveau roman\\" (\\"new novel\\"), associated with Alain Robbe-Grillet, Marguerite Duras, Robert Pinget, Michel Butor, Samuel Beckett, Nathalie Sarraute, Claude Simon, also abandoned traditional plot, voice, characters and psychology. To a certain degree, these developments closely paralleled changes in cinema in the same period (the Nouvelle Vague). The writers Georges Perec, Raymond Queneau, Jacques Roubaud are associated with the creative movement Oulipo (founded in 1960) which uses elaborate mathematical strategies and constraints (such as lipograms and palindromes) as a means of triggering ideas and inspiration. Poetry in the post-war period followed a number of interlinked paths, most notably deriving from surrealism (such as with the early work of Ren√© Char), or from philosophical and phenomenological concerns stemming from Heidegger, Friedrich H√∂lderlin, existentialism, the relationship between poetry and the visual arts, and St√©phane Mallarm√©'s notions of the limits of language. Another important influence was the German poet Paul Celan. Poets working within these philosophical/language concerns‚Äîespecially concentrated around the review \\"L'Eph√©m√®re\\"‚Äîinclude Yves Bonnefoy, Andr√© du Bouchet, Jacques Dupin, Claude Esteban, Roger Giroux and Philippe Jaccottet. Many of these ideas were also key to the works of Maurice Blanchot. The unique poetry of Francis Ponge exerted a strong influence on a variety of writers (both phenomenologists and those from the group \\"Tel Quel\\"). The later poets Claude Royet-Journoud, Anne-Marie Albiach, Emmanuel Hocquard, and to a degree Jean Daive, describe a shift from Heidegger to Ludwig Wittgenstein and a reevaluation of Mallarm√©'s notion of fiction and theatricality; these poets were also influenced by certain English-language modern poets (such as Ezra Pound, Louis Zukofsky, William Carlos Williams, and George Oppen) along with certain American postmodern and avant garde poets loosely grouped around the language poetry movement (such as Michael Palmer, Keith Waldrop and Susan Howe; with her husband Keith Waldrop, Rosmarie Waldrop has a profound association with these poets, due in no small measure to her translations of Edmond Jab√®s and the prose of Paul Celan into English). The events of May 1968 marked a watershed in the development of a radical ideology of revolutionary change in education, class, family and literature. In theater, the conception of \\"cr√©ation collective\\" developed by Ariane Mnouchkine's Th√©√¢tre du Soleil refused division into writers, actors and producers: the goal was for total collaboration, for multiple points of view, for an elimination of separation between actors and the public, and for the audience to seek out their own truth. The most important review of the post-1968 period -- Tel Quel‚Äîis associated with the writers Philippe Sollers, Julia Kristeva, Georges Bataille, the poets Marcelin Pleynet and , the critics Roland Barthes, G√©rard Genette and the philosophers Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan. Another post-1968 change was the birth of \\"√âcriture f√©minine\\" promoted by the feminist Editions des Femmes, with new women writers as Chantal Chawaf, H√©l√®ne Cixous, Luce Irigaray ... From the 1960s on, many of the most daring experiments in French literature have come from writers born in French overseas departments or former colonies. This Francophone literature includes the prize-winning novels of Tahar ben Jelloun (Morocco), Patrick Chamoiseau (Martinique), Amin Maalouf (Lebanon) and Assia Djebar (Algeria).

Overview  The economic, political and social crises of contemporary France -terrorism, violence, immigration, unemployment, racism, etc.‚Äîand (for some) the notion that France has lost its sense of identity and international prestige‚Äîthrough the rise of American hegemony, the growth of Europe and of global capitalism ()‚Äîhave created what some critics (like Nancy Huston) have seen as a new form of detached nihilism, reminiscent of the 50s and 60s (Beckett, Cioran). The best known of these authors is Michel Houellebecq, whose Atomised () was a major international phenomenon. These tendencies have also come under attack. In one of her essays, Nancy Huston criticises Houellebecq for his nihilism; she also makes an acerbic censure of his novels in her work The teachers of despair (). Although the contemporary social and political context can be felt in recent works, overall, French literature written in past decades has been disengaged from explicit political discussion (unlike the authors of the 1930s‚Äì1940s or the generation of 1968) and has focused on the intimate and the anecdotal. It has tended to no longer see itself as a means of criticism or world transformation, with some notable exceptions (such as Michel Houellebecq or Maurice Dantec). Other contemporary writers during the last decade have consciously used the process of \\"autofiction\\" (similar to the notion of \\"faction\\") to renew the novel (Christine Angot for example). \\"Autofiction\\" is a term invented by Serge Doubrovsky in 1977. It is a new sort of romanticised autobiography that resembles the writing of the romantics of the nineteenth century. A few other authors may be perceived as vaguely belonging to this group: Alice Ferney, Annie Ernaux, Olivia Rosenthal, Anne Wiazemsky, and Vassilis Alexakis. In a related vein, Catherine Millet's 2002 memoir The Sexual Life of Catherine M. gained much press for its frank exploration of the author's sexual experiences. Contemporary French authors include: Jonathan Littell, David Foenkinos, Jean-Michel Espitallier, Christophe Tarkos, Olivier Cadiot, Chlo√© Delaume, Patrick Bouvet, Charles Pennequin, Nathalie Quintane, Fr√©d√©ric-Yves Jeannet, Nina Bouraoui, Hubries le Dieu, Arno Bertina, Edouard Lev√©, Bruno Guiblet, Christophe Fiat, and Tristan Garcia. Many of the most lauded works in French over the last decades have been written by individuals from former French colonies or overseas possessions. This Francophone literature includes the novels of Ahmadou Kourouma (C√¥te d'Ivoire), Tahar ben Jelloun (Morocco), Patrick Chamoiseau (Martinique), Amin Maalouf (Lebanon), Mehdi Belhaj Kacem (Tunisia) and Assia Djebar (Algeria). France has a number of important literary awards Grand Prix du roman de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, Prix D√©cembre, Prix Femina, Prix Flore, Prix Goncourt, Prix Interalli√©, Prix M√©dicis, and Prix Renaudot.Prix des Prix Litt√©raires, prix-litteraires.net In 2011 a new, controversial, award was created called Prix des prix litt√©raires (\\"Prize of Literary Prizes\\") which picks its winner from among the winners of these prizes.Laurent Martinet, L'Express, 15, 12, 2011, \\"A quoi bon un prix des prix litt√©raires Extr√™me contemporain The term extr√™me contemporain is a French expression used to indicate French literary production published in France in the last 10 years.2000‚Äì2010 The extr√™me contemporain is, then, an ever- shifting concept. This term was used for the first time by French writer Michel Chaillou in 1989. This simple and convenient definition hides a complex and chaotic literary situation, both from the chronological point of view (the temporal boundaries of the extr√™me contemporain are in continuous shifting) and for the hetereogeneity of present French literary production, which cannot be defined in a clear and homogeneous way. The term extr√™me contemporain, therefore, is all-inclusive. The literary production of this period is characterized by a transitory quality; because of the manifolded nature of such an immense corpus of texts, the identification of specific tendencies is inevitably partial and precarious. Therefore, to define the extr√™me contemporain as a literary movement would be very improper: it is a mere term of convenience used by commentators and not by the authors themselves. The extr√™me contemporain can be seen as a \\"literary constellation\\" hardly organized in schemes. In some cases, authors of the extr√™me contemporain follow an \\"aesthetics of fragments\\": their narration is broken into pieces or they show, like Pascal Quignard, for instance, a preference for short sentences. The \\"apportionment\\" of knowledge can also be carried out by the use of a chaotic verbal stream, the interior monologue, tropisms, repetition and endophasy. The feeling of uncertainty experience by writers leads him to put in question the notion of novel and its very form, preferring the more general notion of r√©cit. Then, a return to reality takes place: in Pierre Bergounioux's works, readers witness the cultural upsetting concerning generations which follow one another; Fran√ßois Bon describes the exclusion from social and industrial reality; many authors of crime stories, like Jean- Patrick Manchette and Didier Daeninckx, describe social and political reality, and so it does Maurice G. Dantec in his works halfway between spy stories and science fiction; on another side, Annie Ernaux's √©criture plate (\\"flat writing\\") tries to demolish the distance between reality and its narration. Subjects are shown in a persistent state of crisis. However, a return to everyday life and trivial habits also takes place: the attention is focused to the \\"outcasts of literature\\", like, for instance, old people. This use of triviality and everyday life expresses itself in a new sort of \\"minimalism\\": from Pierre Michon's Small lives fictional biographies of unknown people, to Philippe Delerm's \\"small pleasures\\". The facets of this minimalism manifest themselves in many ways, through the triviality of the subject, through short forms, or through concise and bare phrases. On one hand, heroicized characters try to build up their own individual way against a senseless reality, so that emarginated or marginal people emerge through the building up of their own story; on the other hand, a \\"negative minimalism\\" takes place: characters stagnate in social and relational difficulties. ;French authors of the extr√™me contemporain (selection) * Eliette Ab√©cassis * Jean-Pierre Abraham * Olivier Adam * Emmanuel Adely * Hafid Aggoune * Eva Almassy * Marc Alpozzo * Jacques- Pierre Amette * Jean-Pierre Andrevon * Christine Angot * Yann Apperry * Claude Arnaud * Pierre Assouline * Alexis Aubenque * Brigitte Aubert * Antoine Audouard * Yvan Audouard * Pierre Autin-Grenier * Ayerdhal * Fran√ßois B√©gaudeau * Fr√©d√©ric Beigbeder * Pierre Bergounioux * Arno Bertina * Jacques A.

There are about 150 species, including 110 in Australia and thirty six in New Zealand. Description Plants in the genus Pimelea are herbs or small shrubs usually with leaves arranged in opposite pairs. The leaves are usually paler on the lower surface and the petiole is usually very short. The flowers are usually arranged in groups on the ends of the branches and have no petals but four petal-like sepals and two stamens. The ovary has a single ovule and the fruit is usually a nut containing a single seed. Taxonomy and naming The genus Pimelea was first formally described in 1788 by Joseph Gaertner from unpublished descriptions by Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander. The first species Gaertner described was Pimelea laevigata, now known as Pimelea prostrata. The name Pimelea is from the Ancient Greek word pimele meaning \\"fat or \\"lard\\", possibly referring to the oily seeds or fleshy cotyledons of riceflowers. Ecology Some species, including P. curviflora, P. flava, P. glauca, P. linifolia, P. microcephala, P. neo-anglica, P. pauciflora, P. simplex and P. trichostachya are known to be toxic to stock and there is no known cure.

Because of an actual ban on satire in prose and verse publications in 1599 (the Bishops' Ban of 1599), the satirical urge had no other remaining outlet than the stage. The resulting controversy, which unfolded between 1599 and 1602, involved the playwright Ben Jonson on one side and his rivals John Marston and Thomas Dekker (with Thomas Middleton as an ancillary combatant) on the other. The role Shakespeare played in the conflict, if any, has long been a topic of dispute among scholars. Sequence of events The least disputed facts of the matter yield a schema like this: # In his play Histriomastix (1599), Marston satirized Jonson‚Äôs pride through the character Chrisoganus. # Jonson responded by satirizing Marston's wordy style in Every Man out of His Humour (1599), a play acted by the Lord Chamberlain's Men. (Note: the order of these first two events has been questioned by James Bednarz, who argues that \\"(a) Histriomastix was deliberately launched in the final weeks of 1599 to serve as a critique of Jonson's first \\"comicall satire\\" Every Man Out, and that (b) Jonson's disparagement of Histriomastix in Every Man Out (III.iv.29) was subsequently added to the acting script of his already completed play, before the end of the same year, as a rejoinder to Marston's initial attack.\\" Bednarz, James. \\"Marston's Subversion of Shakespeare and Jonson: Histriomastix and the War of the Theaters.\\" Medieval & Renaissance Drama in England. Vol. VI. New York: AMS Press, 1993. 103-28 # Marston, in turn, replied with Jack Drum's Entertainment (1600), a play acted by the Children of Paul's, satirizing Jonson as Brabant Senior, a cuckold. # In Cynthia's Revels (1600), acted by the Children of the Chapel, Jonson satirizes both Marston and Dekker. The former is thought to be represented by the character Hedon, a \\"light voluptuous reveller,\\" and the latter by Anaides, a \\"strange arrogating puff.\\" # Marston next attacked Jonson in What You Will (1601), a play most likely acted by the Children of Paul's. # Jonson responded with The Poetaster (1601), by the Children of the Chapel again, in which Jonson portrays the character representing Marston as vomiting bombastic and ridiculous words he has ingested. # Dekker completed the sequence with Satiromastix (1601), which mocks Jonson (\\"Horace\\") as an arrogant and overbearing hypocrite. The play was acted by both the Children of Paul's and the Lord Chamberlain's Men. Apparently Jonson and Marston later came to terms and even collaborated with George Chapman on the play Eastward Hoe in 1605. That play offended King James with its anti-Scottish satire, a part apparently written by Marston. While Marston evaded capture, Jonson and Chapman ended up in jail as a result. Context Shakespeare probably alludes to The War of the Theatres in a scene between Hamlet and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern: :Rosencrantz: Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question. :Hamlet: Is't possible? :Guildenstern: O, there has been much throwing about of brains. (Hamlet 2.2.362-9) Scholars differ over the true nature and extent of the rivalry behind the Poetomachia. Some have seen it as a competition between theatre companies rather than individual writers, though this is a minority view. It has even been suggested that the playwrights involved had no serious rivalry and even admired each other, and that the \\"War\\" was a self-promotional publicity stunt, a \\"planned ... quarrel to advertise each other as literary figures and for profit.\\"W. L. Halstead, summarised in Logan and Smith, p. 13. Most critics see the Poetomachia as a mixture of personal rivalries and serious artistic concerns--\\"a vehicle for aggressively expressing differences...in literary theory...[a] basic philosophical debate on the status of literary and dramatic authorship.\\"James Bednarz, quoted in Hirschfeld, p. 26.

In later literature, Sharabha is described as an eight-legged deer. The Shaiva scriptures narrate that god Shiva assumed the Avatar (incarnation) of Sharabha to pacify Narasimha - the fierce man-lion avatar of Vishnu worshipped by Vaishnava sect. This form is popularly known as Sharabeshwara (\\"Lord Sharabha\\") or Sharabeshwaramurti. The Vaishnavas refute the portrayal of Narasimha as being destroyed by Shiva- Sharabha and regard Sharabha as a name of Vishnu. Another tale narrates that Vishnu assumed the form of the ferocious Gandabherunda bird-animal to combat Sharabha. In Buddhism, Sharabha appears in Jataka Tales as a previous birth of the Buddha. It also appears in Tibetan Buddhist art, symbolizing the perfection of effort. As a figure of power and majesty, Sharabha has appeared in numerous emblems, such as those of the State government of the Indian state of Karnataka, the University of Mysore, and Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited. Development of character and iconography In Sanskrit literature, Sharabha is initially described as an aggressive beast that roared and scared other animals in the hills and forest areas. Similies compare warriors to Sharabha. In the Hindu epic Mahabharata, this form of Sharabha was defined as a lion-slaying monster with eight legs, eyes on the top; living in the forest and which ate raw flesh. It is also mentioned as residing on Mount Krauncha but not as a monster but as an ordinary beast along with lions and tigers on mount Gandhamadana. The epic also includes Sharabha in the list of edible animals - the mrigajatis- the animal group of antelope, deer, hare, bear, ruru deer, sambar, gayal, boar, and buffalo - which was offered as part of food at dinner to guests. Sharabha appears primarily as the incarnation of the god Shiva, as a name of a monkey-king in the epic Ramayana, also as a proper name of heroes and serpent NƒÅgas and one of the names of god Vishnu as well as Buddha. In defining the ecological theme in Hindu medicine related to jungle and the aroma of meats, Sharabha has also been listed among the deer natives of Kashmir, Nepal, and Sikkim. However, the features explained are of an eight legged animal of the size of a camel with huge horns and conjectured as a large Himalayan goat. =Shiva's incarnation= In Puranic literature, Sharabha is associated with god Shiva, who incarnates to subdue fierce manifestations of Vishnu. The legend of Sharabha fighting Narasimha - the man- lion form of Vishnu - brings to fore the overt rivalry between the devotees of Vishnu (Vaishnava sect) and those of Shiva (Shaiva sect), which exposes the fierce debate aspect. The Shiva Purana The Sharabha Upanishad portrays Sharabha with two heads, two wings, eight legs of the lion with sharp claws and a long tail. The Kalika Purana describes Sharabha as black in colour, with four feet downwards and four feet uplifted, with an enormous body. It also has a long face and nose, nails, eight legs, eight tusks, a cluster of manes, and a long tail. It jumps high repeatedly making a loud cry. Two-headed Sharabha with four legs. The iconography of Sharabeshwaramurti (Shiva as Sharabha) is specifically defined in texts such as Khamikagama and Sritattvanidhi. In Khamikagama, Sharabha is described in the form of a bird with golden color, with two uplifted wings, two red eyes, four legs in the form of a lion touching the ground, four legs with claws upwards, and with an animal tail. The top part of the body is shown as human but with the face of a lion with an ornamented crown; side tusks are also depicted giving an overall frightening sight. It also shows the Narasimha beneath Sharabha's legs as a lion-faced human with anjali (hands folded prayer gesture). (See Infobox image)Rao pp.172‚Äì173 In the Sritattvanidhi, the depiction prescribed for Sharabeshwaramurti is of thirty arms; arms on the right are to hold thunderbolt, mushti, abhaya, chakra (discus), sakti, staff, goad, sword, khatvanga, axe, akshamala, a bone, bow, musala, and fire; and the left hands to display noose, varada, mace, arrow, flag, and another type of sword, a snake, a lotus flower, skull-cup, pustaka, plough, and mrudanga with one hand encircling Durga in a hug. This form is extolled to usher good luck, cure all diseases and destroy all enemies.Rao p.173 The Chola dynasty in Tamil Nadu was particularly favourable to the beliefs of Shaiva sect. It is said that the sectarian aspect got highlighted during their reign. This is evident from the four Sharabha images, the earliest at the Vikramsolishwaram temple near Kumbakonam built by Vikrama Chola (1118‚Äì35). The other images are at Darasuram and Kampahareshvarar temple, Thirubuvanam built by a Chola ruler, Kulottunga Chola III where Sharabha's image is housed in a separate shrine. A sculpture of Sharbeshwaramurti in the Tribhuvanam temple, a Shiva temple in Tanjore district, in Tamil Nadu is seen with three legs, with body and face of a lion and a tail. It has four human arms, the right upper hand holds axe, noose is held in the lower right hand, the deer in the upper left hand and fire in the lower left hand. Narasimha is shown with eight arms in the Airavatesvara Temple at Darasuram, a rare image of the Chola period, in black basalt, depicts Shiva as Sharabha. It is deified in an exclusive small shrine, as part man, beast and bird, destroying the man-lion incarnation of Vishnu, Narasimha. This highlights the hostility between the Shaivite and Vaishnavite sects. In Maharashtra the stone cut Sharabha idol is placed on the outer walls of the entrance gate of many historic forts. Sharabha idol on Kothaligad fort. In iconographic representations of the myth of Shiva vis-√†-vis Vishnu, Sharabha form has been built around Narasimha but substantially embellished with wings to represent Kali and Durga to denote the female powers (shaktis) of Shiva; Sharabha is also shown with a bird head and a serpent in his beak head. In Hindu scriptures =In the Mahabharata= The Hindu epic Mahabharata narrates: a dog, with the help of a Rishi (sage) assumes various animal forms - starting from a dog to a tiger then to an elephant followed by a lion and a sharabha - terrorized every one in the hermitage of the Rishi. Eventually, Sharabha assumed a further fiercer form. In this fierce form he wanted to devour the Rishi. The Rishi then narrating the process of change in Sharabha's development, as a result of his benevolence, cursed Sharabha to go back to his original form of a dog. The epic does not relate Shiva to Sharabha. =Shaiva views= Sharabha (right) with Narasimha killing Hiranyakashipu as Prahlada and his mother look on. The legend of Sharabha as an incarnation of Shiva is narrated in many Hindu scriptures and each presents a different version to suit one's religious beliefs. But one common refrain in all these depictions is that Sharabha is a combination of a huge animal-bird beast with enormous strength manifested with the purpose of pacifying similar ferocious avatars of Vishnu such as Narasimha (man-lion) or Varaha (the boar). The Narasimha- Sharabha legend is linked to gods assuming mythical animal forms to slay or subdue as the case may be. First, Vishnu assumed the form of Narasimha to slay Hiranyakashipu, an asura (demon) king, who was terrorizing the universe and devotee of Shiva. The Shiva Purana mentions: After slaying Hiranyakashipu, Narasimha's wrath threatened the world. At the behest of the gods, Shiva sent Virabhadra to tackle Narasimha. When that failed, Shiva manifested as Sharabha. Sharabha then attacked Narasimha and immobilized him. He thus quelled Narasimha's terrifying rage. Sharabha then decapitated and de-skinned Narasimha so Shiva could wear the hide and lion-head as a garment. The Linga Purana and the Sharabha Upanishad also mention the mutilation and murder of Narasimha. After the mutilation, Vishnu assumed his normal form and retired to his abode, after duly praising Shiva. It was from here on that Shiva came to be known as \\"Sharabeshamurti\\" or \\"Simhagnamurti\\". The Skanda Purana considers Narasimha as a mere irritation and not a threat to the world, contrary to what was brought out in the Shiva and Linga Puranas. The perception was that Vishnu may permanently adopt the fierce form of Narasimha, which would be detrimental to his role of doing good deeds. Hence, the purpose of Shiva assuming the form of Sharabha was to ensure that the lion body of Vishnu was discarded and he got united with his original divine form. Narasimha struck Sharabha with his body, it was Vishnu who groaned in pain and not Sharabha who was in an \\"adamantine body\\". It was then that Vishnu realised that Sharabha was none other than Shiva and bowed and praised Sharabha. Shiva then blesses Vishnu and gives him a boon to kill demons. A Purana ends the story with gods fearing that Sharabha may not be able to control his rage and thus urging Shiva to give up his Sharabha form. Thereafter, Shiva dismembered Sharabha's form; his limbs were given away and his torso became a Kapalika. The Vamana Purana too discusses the tale, ending with Narasimha becoming the calm Vishnu again and Sharabha becoming a lingam, the symbol of Shiva. In the Kalika Purana, Varaha - Vishnu's boar avatar - had amorous dalliance with the earth goddess. He and his three boar sons then created mayhem in the world, which necessitated Shiva to take the form of Sharabha, to kill the Varaha form. Even, Vishnu requests Shiva to destroy Varaha, unable to control his own form. Here, Narasimha appears to aid Varaha. Sharabha kills Narasimha first and then kills Varaha, allowing Vishnu to reabsorb the energies of both his fierce forms. Finally, Sharabha defeats Vishnu. =Vaishnava views= Narasimha transformed into Gandabherunda, to combat Sharabha. Ashtamukha Gandabherunda Narasimha slaying Sharabha and Hiranyakashipu, depicted in his lap. Vaishnava followers including Dvaita scholars, such as Vijayendra Tirtha (1514‚Äì93) refute the portrayal of Narasimha as being destroyed by Sharabha as they consider the Shaivite Puranas as tamasic - and thus not authoritative. The refutation of the Sharabha legend along with ten other Shaivite legends is discussed in a text by Vijayindra Tirtha called Shaivasarvasvakhandanam. Some regional South- Indian folklore tales narrate that Narasimha took the form of Gandabherunda (literally \\"the mighty two-headed\\"), a more ferocious two-headed bird-animal, who combats and kills Shiva-Sharabha. http://thepatriot.in/2018/11/29/one- bird-two-heads/ There is also a reference to Sharabha in the Vishnu sahasranama, the thousand names of Vishnu, and the literal meaning seems to suggest the praise of Sharabha (the lion-killing animal). Stanza 37, line 1: \\"atulah sharabhah bheemah samayagno havirharih sarvalakshanalakshanyah lakshmeevaan samitinjayah.\\" Adi Shankaracharya refers to this 356th name of Vishnu sahasranama as not mentioning the lion-killing animal at all and instead interprets the name to mean, \\"As the Lord shines in the body as the indwelling Self, He is called Sharabha, while the body is sara (perishable).\\"Tapasyananda, Swami, Sri Vishnu Sahasranama, pg. 91, Chennai: Sri Ramakrishna Math. Sanskrit and English, with an English translation of Sri Sankara Bhagavatpada's commentary. Narasimhan Krishnamachari, a scholar on Vishishtadvaita philosophy, states that the name \\"Sharabha\\" has been interpreted in two ways namely; the first interpretation means \\"the Destroyer (of those who transgress the bounds of ethics),\\" as given by the Sri Vaishnavite commentator, Parasara Bhattar and the second interpretation as given by Adi Sankara, among others. The former is based on the Sanskrit verb SR, which means \\"to injure to destroy\\". According to C. V. Radhakrishna Sastri, \\"Sara also refers to an arrow, and the perishable body shines if it is aimed at Bhagavan, because He shines in that body.\\" In Buddhist scriptures Sharabha is depicted similar to a deer, folio from Jataka tales. In the Jataka tales of the Buddha's previous lives, there is narration related to his birth as Bodhisattva in a forest as a Sharabha, the eight-legged deer. This story is of one compassion of the deer shown towards the King who wanted to hunt the deer. The King, while trying to hunt the deer, fell into a precipice with his horse. The deer instead of abandoning the king to his fate rescued him. The King was deeply touched by the compassion shown by the deer and thereafter promulgated a decry stating that hunting was an illegal activity in his country. In Tibetan Buddhism, sharabha is represented as a beast with a goat's head and horns, a lion's mane and horse's body and legs. It symbolizes determination, strength and speed. Sometimes, it is represented additionally with horns of an antelope and claws of an eagle. Sometimes, the goat head is replaced by a lion's, horse's feet by a lion's and horns can be of a ram. A common feature of all representations is the horse's body. It is often depicted as mounts of young Devas or dwarfs in a Torana ‚Äì a six-level archway behind an enlightenment throne of a Buddha or Bodhisattva. Together with the devas, they symbolize the perfection of effort (virya). As emblem , the Karnataka state emblem, flanked by red maned yellow lion. The Government of Karnataka, the University of Mysore and the Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited (KSDL-an industrial unit owned by the Government of Karnataka) have adopted Sharabha, with modifications and also appropriate justifications, as their emblem or logo. In Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited logo, Sharabha is depicted in the form of a body of a lion with the head of an elephant to represent the virtues of wisdom, courage and strength.

The instrument was designed by Thomas Machell of Glasgow in the 1860s, at the same time as Victor Mustel's organologically synonymous typophone, and manufactured by the firm of Thomas Machell & Sons during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Most of the early models are tuned to sharp pitch, or the diapason normal of a 435. Some of the late models use an action suspended on a system of leaf springs, which is considerably quieter than that illustrated. Description Diagram showing layout of action The dulcitone is a transposing instrument of the idiophone class; it sounds an octave higher than the standard (eight foot pitch) written pitch. It has a five octave written range from AA to a3 (sounding range from A to a4). A significant feature of the dulcitone was its portability, a product of its lightweight and compact construction and the fact that the tuning forks (unlike, for instance, the strings of a piano) were not prone to going out of tune. However, the volume produced is extremely limited, and the dulcitone's part is frequently substituted by a glockenspiel.The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Musical Instruments, Two pieces scored for the dulcitone is Vincent d'Indy's Song of the Bells (1888) and Percy Grainger's \\"The Power of Rome and the Christian Heart\\" (1943). In 1911 there were 3 versions listed: Style B, with 3¬Ω octaves in solid mahogany (polished Chippendale) or in solid oak (fumed) complete with folding stand, for ¬£12; Style R - in mahogany or oak with 4 octaves for ¬£15; Style F - in mahogany or oak with 5 octaves, for ¬£18. Surviving examples exist as far afield as New Zealand, where one is preserved in the Whittaker's Musical Museum.

The music was composed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (his opus 66). The score was completed in 1889, and is the second of his three ballets. The original scenario was conceived by Ivan Vsevolozhsky, and is based on Charles Perrault's La Belle au bois dormant. The choreographer of the original production was Marius Petipa. The premiere performance took place at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg on January 15, 1890. The work has become one of the classical repertoire's most famous ballets.Roger Fiske (1973): Eulenberg Edition, Foreword to the complete score of the ballet: \\"On 2 Feb 1939 Sadler‚Äôs Wells presented the ballet in London with Margot Fonteyn in the title role... This was the first successful production outside Russia, and it led to The Sleeping Beauty becoming extremely popular in all countries where classical ballet is cultivated. . . The way in which he developed his themes and the lavish originality with which he scored the music raised his ballets far above those his predecessors had composed.\\" History Tchaikovsky was approached by the Director of the Imperial Theatres in St. Petersburg, Ivan Vsevolozhsky on 25 May 1888 about a possible ballet adaptation on the subject of the story of Undine. It was later decided that Charles Perrault's La Belle au bois dormant would be the story for which Tchaikovsky would compose the music for the ballet. Tchaikovsky did not hesitate to accept the commission, although he was aware that his only previous ballet, Swan Lake, met with little enthusiasm at that stage of his career. Tchaikovsky based his work on Brothers Grimm's version of Perrault's 'Dornr√∂schen'. In that version, the Princess's parents survive the 100-year sleep to celebrate the Princess's wedding with the Prince. However, Vsevolozhsky incorporated Perrault's other characters from his stories into the ballet, such as Puss in Boots, Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Bluebird, Bluebeard, Ricky of the Tuft and Tom Thumb. Other French fairy tale characters to be featured are Beauty and the Beast, Pretty Goldilocks and The White Cat. Regardless, Tchaikovsky was happy to inform the Director of the Imperial Theatre that he had great pleasure studying the work and came away with adequate inspiration to do it justice. The choreographer was Marius Petipa, ballet master of the Imperial Ballet, who wrote a very detailed list of instructions as to the musical requirements. Tchaikovsky worked quickly on the new work at Frolovskoye; he began initial sketches in the winter of 1888 and began orchestration on the work on 30 May 1889. The ballet's focus was undeniably on the two main conflicting forces of good (the Lilac Fairy) and evil (Carabosse); each has a leitmotif representing them, which run through the entire ballet, serving as an important thread to the underlying plot. Act III of the work, however, takes a complete break from the two motifs and instead places focus on the individual characters of the various court dances. The ballet's premiere received more favorable accolades than Swan Lake from the press but Tchaikovsky never had the luxury of being able to witness his work become an instant success in theatres outside of Russia. He died in 1893. By 1903, The Sleeping Beauty was the second most popular ballet in the repertory of the Imperial Ballet (the Petipa/Pugni The Pharaoh's Daughter was first), having been performed 200 times in only 10 years.Original cast members costumed for Act I. At center is Carlotta Brianza as Aurora. Mariinsky Theatre, St. Petersburg, 1890 A production mounted at the La Scala in Milan did not arouse much interest and it was not until 1921 that, in London, the ballet finally gained wide acclaim and eventually a permanent place in the classical repertoire. In 1999, the Mariinsky Ballet reconstructed the original 1899 production, including reproductions of the original sets and costumes. Although the 1951 Kirov production by Konstantin Sergeyev is available on DVD/Video, the 1999 \\"authentic\\" version was never commercially released. The Sleeping Beauty is Tchaikovsky's longest ballet, lasting nearly four hours at full length (counting the intermissions). The complete score runs practically 3 hours. It is nearly always cut. At the premiere, Tsar Alexander III summoned Tchaikovsky to the imperial box. The Tsar made the simple remark 'Very nice,' which seemed to have irritated Tchaikovsky, who had likely expected a more favorable response.Lawrence & Elizabeth Hanson, Tchaikovsky page 269 Cassell London 1965. =Performance history= St. Petersburg premiere (world premiere) *Date: 15 January 1890 *Place: Imperial Mariinsky Theatre, St. Petersburg *Balletmaster: Marius Petipa *Conductor: Riccardo Drigo *Scene Designers: Henrich Levogt (Prologue), Ivan Andreyev (Act 1), Mikhail Bocharov (Acts 1 & 2), Matvey Shishkov (Act 3) *Director of the Imperial Theaters: Ivan Vsevolozhsky *Costumes: *Original Cast: Feliks Krzesi≈Ñski (King Florestan), Giuseppina Cecchetti (Queen), Carlotta Brianza (Princess Aurora), Marie Petipa (Lilac Fairy), Enrico Cecchetti (Carabosse, Bluebird), Pavel Gerdt (Prince D√©sir√©), Varvara Nikitina (Princess Florine) Moscow premiere *Date: 17 January 1899 *Place: Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre *Balletmaster: Aleksandr Gorsky *Conductor: Andrey Arends *Scene Designers: Anatoliy Geltser, Karl Valts (Waltz) *Original Cast: Lyubov Roslavleva (Princess Aurora), M.

Prologue (The Christening) King Florestan XXIV and his Queen have welcomed their first child, Princess Aurora, and declare a grand christening ceremony to honor her. Six fairies are invited to the ceremony to bestow gifts on the child. Each fairy brings a gift of a virtue or positive trait, such as beauty, courage, sweetness, musical talent, and mischief. The most powerful fairy, the Lilac Fairy, arrives with her entourage, but before she can bestow her gift, the evil fairy Carabosse arrives with her minions. Carabosse furiously asks the King and Queen why she had not received an invitation to the christening. The blame falls on Catalabutte, the Master of Ceremonies who was in charge of the guest list. Carabosse gleefully tears his wig off and beats him with her staff, before placing a curse upon the baby princess as revenge: Aurora will indeed grow up to be a beautiful, healthy, delightful young lady, but on her sixteenth birthday she will prick her finger on a Spindle and die. The King and Queen are horrified and beg Carabosse for mercy, but she shows none. However, the Lilac Fairy intervenes. Though she does not have enough power to completely undo the curse, she alters it, allowing the spindle to cause a peaceful 100-year sleep for the princess, rather than death. At the end of those 100 years, she will be woken by the kiss of a handsome prince. Relieved that Aurora's life will ultimately be spared, the court is set at ease. Act I (The Spell) It is the day of Princess Aurora's sixteenth birthday. Celebrations are underway, though the King is still unsettled by Carabosse's omen. The master of ceremonies discovers several peasant ladies frolicking about with knitting needles and alerts the King, who initially sentences the women to a harsh punishment. The Queen gently persuades him to spare the innocent citizens, and he agrees. An elaborate waltz is performed and Princess Aurora arrives. She is introduced to four suitors by her doting parents. Aurora and the suitors perform the famous Rose Adagio. Presently, a cloaked stranger appears and offers a gift to the princess: a spindle. Having never seen one before, Aurora curiously examines the strange object as her parents desperately try to intervene. As predicted, she pricks her finger. While initially appearing to recover quickly, she falls into a swoon and collapses. The cloaked stranger reveals herself to be Carabosse, who believes that her curse still stands and that the princess is dead. Once again, the Lilac Fairy quells the hubbub and reminds the King and Queen that Aurora is merely asleep. The princess is carried off to bed, and the Lilac Fairy casts a spell of slumber over the entire kingdom, which will only be broken when Aurora awakens. A thick layer of thorny plants grows over the palace, hiding it from view.

(Mariinsky Theatre, St. Petersburg, 1890) Act II (The Vision) One hundred years later, Prince D√©sir√© is attending a hunting party. Though his companions are lighthearted, the prince is unhappy and eventually asks to be left alone. On his own in the forest, he is met by the Lilac Fairy, who has chosen him to awaken Aurora. She shows him a vision of the beautiful princess, and the prince is immediately smitten. The Lilac Fairy explains the situation, and D√©sir√© begs to be taken to the princess. The Lilac Fairy takes him to the hidden castle. Carabosse makes one last attempt to cement her vengeful curse, but the Lilac Fairy and the prince manage to defeat her together at last. Once inside the castle, D√©sir√© awakens Aurora with a kiss. The rest of the court wakes as well, and the King and Queen heartily approve when the prince proposes marriage and the princess accepts. Act III (The Wedding) The royal wedding is under way. Guests include the Jewel Fairies: Diamond, Gold, Silver and Sapphire, and of course the Lilac Fairy. Fairytale characters are in attendance, including Puss in Boots and The White Cat, Princess Florine and the Bluebird, and others. Aurora and D√©sir√© perform a grand Pas de Deux, and the entire ensemble dances. The prince and princess are married, with the Lilac Fairy blessing the union.

All libretti and programs of works performed on the stages of the Imperial Theatres were titled in French, which was the official language of the Emperor's Court, as well as the language in which balletic terminology is derived.

Based at Air Force Base Langebaanweg near Cape Town, the Silver Falcons fly the Pilatus PC-7 Mk II, the basic trainer of the SA Air Force in a 5-ship routine. The main purpose of the Silver Falcons is to enhance the image of the South African Air Force, encourage recruitment and instill national pride through public display. History Originally formed in 1946 as the Bumbling Bees and flying the T-6 Harvard and then the de Havilland Vampire. The Bumbling Bees flew a 4 ship formation and made a name for themselves by regularly taking part in South African airshows. The team disbanded in the late 1950s leaving a gap in South African aviation. During 1966 the Aermacchi MB-326 \\"Impala\\" arrived and the Bumbling Bees were reinstated under the command of Colonel Chris Prins. The Silver Falcons were based at Air Force Base Langebaanweg on the West Coast of South Africa, near Cape Town. The team went from strength to strength and the idea to change the name to a more bilingual-sounding name came about. The Silver Falcons (\\"Die Silwer Valke\\" in Afrikaans) team was founded and gave their first display in November 1967 at the opening of the Atlas Aircraft Corporation. During 1986, under the command of Commandant Dave Knoesen, the team was expanded to a 5 ship to bring about more exciting display postures and to include a solo display. The aircraft were also painted in orange, white and blue to represent the then current South African flag. The Silver Falcons operated from Langebaanweg until the early 1990s, when all the Impala training was moved to Air Force Base Hoedspruit, in the Lowveld region of South Africa, and formed part of 85 Combat Flying School. During 1994 with a new national flag, the aircraft were repainted to represent the colours of the SA Air Force: blue, light blue and white. The Silver Falcons continued to operate from Hoedspruit until in 1998, the Silver Falcons moved to AFB Langebaanweg and commenced training in the Pilatus Astra. The decision was partly made due to the shortage of flying instructors at 85 CFS and also to display the new turbo-prop trainer to the nation. During this move, the team was once again reduced to a 4 ship. For nine years, the team flew in the standard red and white paint scheme of the Astra fleet. In 2008, 6 of the Astras were repainted in a unique blue and white livery and the team was expanded to a 5-ship again. Paint for the respray was donated by a local paint supplier, First African Paints. The first display in the new livery was flown at the Africa Aerospace and Defense Expo at AFB Ysterplaat in September 2008. Aircraft The Pilatus PC-7 Mk II is a high performance single-engine turboprop aircraft, used by the South African Air Force for ab-initio training. It is powered by a 750 shp limited to 700 Pratt & Whitney PT6A-25C engine and is designed for G-loadings between +7 and ‚àí3.5 G, making it ideal for aerobatics. The aircraft has a tandem seat configuration with Martin Baker CH-11A ejection seats. For all practical purposes the PC-7 Mk II can be seen as a hybrid between the PC-7 and the newer PC-9. Both these aircraft types are popular as military trainers and are in service with more than 30 air forces. Like the PC-9, the PC-7 Mk II features a larger cockpit, upgraded airframe and instruments and is fitted with a ventral airbrake, but it retains the smaller engine of the original PC-7.

The museum from the car park. The River & Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, England, is located on a site at Mill Meadows by the River Thames. It has three main themes represented by major permanent galleries, the non-tidal River Thames, the international sport of rowing and the local town of Henley-on-Thames. History The impetus for the museum largely came from David Lunn-Rockliffe, formerly Executive Secretary of the Amateur Rowing Association. The building was designed by the modernist architect Sir David Chipperfield and has won awards for the building itself, including the Royal Fine Art Commission Building of the Year award in 1999. It was also UK National Heritage Museum of the Year in 1999. It was officially opened in November 1998 by Queen Elizabeth II. Major benefactors include The Arbib Foundation run by local businessmen Sir Martyn Arbib and Urs Schwarzenbach. The Museum has been operating as an independent charity and is celebrating its 20th birthday in 2018. 1998 Opening exhibition Julian Trevelyan 'River Thames' Etchings. In 2004, a Wind in the Willows attraction for families was installed. This is a walk-through recreation using models, sets and an audio-guide of all the E.H. Shepard illustrations from the Kenneth Grahame book. In 2006, the museum completed an extensive refurbishment of its Rowing Gallery, thanks to a major donation by Urs Schwarzenbach. Now known as the Schwarzenbach International Rowing Gallery, it tells the story of rowing from its beginnings in ancient Greece to the modern Olympics. Thematically arranged the gallery includes sections devoted to the Oxford v. Cambridge Boat Race, World & Olympic rowing, professional rowing in the 19th and early 20th centuries, boat building, coaching and nutrition. The museum now displays a unique collection of video clips. A feature in the Schwarzenbach International Rowing Gallery is an interactive exhibit In the Cox's Seat that allows visitors to sit in a rowing boat and experience a race at Henley Royal Regatta Temporary exhibitions have included work by the Thames-based painter Chris Gollon, the local 20th century artist John Piper: 'The Master of Diversity in Association with Bohun Gallery and the Michael Gyselynck John Piper Collection, one of his collaborators, the potter Geoffrey Eastop, the local painter Nick Schlee, and the local furniture maker Philip Koomen. In 2006, there was an exhibition by John Piper's grandson, Luke Piper. Between November 2006 and February 2007 there is an exhibition of the illustrations of E.H. Shepard called The Man who Drew Pooh & Toad. The museum was one of the first to have a website, which existed before the building opened.J. P. Bowen and J. S. M. Bowen,The Website of the UK Museum of the Year, 1999. In D. Bearman and J. Trant (eds.), Proc. Museums and the Web 2000, Minneapolis, United States, 16‚Äì19 April 2000. Archives & Museum Informatics, Pittsburgh, USA, 2000. Themes The Museum includes four themes explored through a wide variety of exhibitions and events across four galleries and special exhibitions: * The past, present and future of the River Thames * The historic riverside community of Henley on Thames * The international sport of rowing * The Wind in the Willows Galleries =The Wind in the Willows Gallery= The permanent Wind in the Willows exhibition includes Mr Toad, Ratty, Badger, and Mole to a location on the bank of the River Thames, whose creatures and landscapes provided the inspiration behind the original book. E.H. Shepard‚Äôs illustrations are included as 3-D models that depict the adventures of Mr Toad, Ratty, and their friends. The Museum has rights to use the original images by Shepard, who explored the meadows and willow-fringed river around nearby Pangbourne in search of settings for these illustrations. The exhibition follows the original storyline, using theatrical lighting and sound techniques to take visitors on a journey through the world of The Wind in the Willows. Interactive exhibits and specially developed audio guides help visitors feel a part of the story. =Thames Gallery= The Thames Gallery is the largest of the River & Rowing Museum‚Äôs permanent galleries. It provides an interpretation of the River Thames from source to sea. The River Thames is a key element of life in the Thames Valley and the country as a whole. The gallery offers visitors a range of perspectives, looking at the river as an inspiration for the arts, as a natural habitat for wildlife and as both a source of pleasure and a means of trade. In a mix of music, art, photography, original objects, boats and oral testimony the gallery takes the visitor on a journey from the source at Kemble to the Thames Barrier. Exhibits from local and private collections illustrate the historic and social importance of the river, while interactive displays enable visitors to learn more about river management and water supply. Aspects of the Thames in the exhibition include: * Travel from the hidden source to the sea * Thames paintings in the gallery and on terminals * The wildlife and the bugs that make their home in and alongside the river * Music, poetry and literature inspired by the Thames, from Conrad to The Kinks * The craftsmanship of boat builders from log boats to skiffs and punts * How the Thames has been managed throughout the ages * The importance of weirs, locks and bridges and meet some of their custodians * Stories told by members of riverside communities =Schwarzenbach International Rowing Gallery= There is a contemporary painting by the entrance, Gollon At Henley, painted by Chris Gollon and commissioned by the River & Rowing Museum in 2008. The image shows a defeated crew at Henley Royal Regatta. Inside the gallery, the story of international rowing is presented, allowing the visitor to experience the sport and understand what it is like to compete on the water. Rowing is one of the world's oldest sports and the gallery tells its story in detail. On display are many objects no previously shown in public, film footage showing races, and a range of interactive exhibits of general interest. Sections include exhibits on the following: * Six communities who relied on the oar for their livelihood * A race at the Henley Royal Regatta in 360¬∞ panoramic vision * Rowing across the world, and throughout the centuries * Races at the Olympics, Boat Race, etc. * Professional rowers, sports stars of their day * Coaches and boat builders whose work has allowed champions to flourish * Racing craft spanning 200 years of design and innovation =Invesco Perpetual Henley Gallery= The Invesco Perpetual Henley Gallery tells the story of the town of Henley-on-Thames, built by the river. The history presented covers industry, arts, the Civil War, sports, etc. An interactive touch-screen allows visitors to take a virtual tour around the streets of Henley, travel back through time to when the town was established, see how it has changed over time, and how it became famous for rowing. The Museum's latest acquisition is an Iron Age Hoard. It is made up of 32 gold coins dating from approximately 50 AD. It was found in Henley in 2003 and is the only hoard of British-made Iron Age coins from Oxfordshire to have survived intact. They have been acquired jointly by the River & Rowing Museum and the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. Henley was established in the 12th century when its location by the river made it convenient as an inland port for shipping timber, grain, and firewood to the rapidly growing city of London. From this time onwards, the town's fortunes were linked to the river and transport. Boats, stagecoaches, railway engines and motors have in turn brought goods and people to the town for business and pleasure. Henley Royal Regatta has made the town of Henley-on-Thames an international centre of rowing. Established in 1839, and gaining a royal patron in 1851, the Regatta brings together leading international oarsmen and women and is considered to be part of the English social calendar. Town and Regatta celebrations since 1899 are presented on film in the gallery. Painted in 1698 by the Dutch master Jan Siberechts, Henley from the Wargrave Road has its own room off the Henley Gallery. A masterpiece displaying the multifaceted life of the town and surrounding countryside, its origins are only now coming to light. The painting is a record of social history, showing the river trade, agriculture, and social hierarchy, alongside a still familiar view of the town. Henley from the Wargrave Road was purchased with the assistance of the National Art Collections Fund and the Heritage Lottery Fund. =Special exhibitions= Treasures Gallery, Sir Graham Kirkham Gallery and The Wall provide venues for special exhibitions throughout the year. The Museum‚Äôs exhibition programme is designed around its major themes and includes exhibitions that have a family appeal as well as more specialist exhibitions. Topics range from celebrations of major events and anniversaries to arts, crafts, and sculpture or in-depth investigations.

It was the soundtrack album for the British drama film of the same name based on the experiences of two journalists in the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia. It is the only full-length film score written by Oldfield. The music was orchestrated by David Bedford. The Killing Fields was re- released in a remastered edition format on 29 January 2016, as per all previous albums which were originally released on the Virgin label.  History  Though Oldfield's music had been used in films before (see The Exorcist and The Space Movie), this was the first time he had written specifically for film, and so far the only time. Oldfield composed the album on a Fairlight CMI. Like many soundtracks, the album is not a comprehensive record of all the Oldfield music used in the film. Most notably, the music accompanying the darkroom sequence does not feature on the album. The single from the album, \\"√âtude\\", is taken from the Francisco Tarrega piece \\"Recuerdos de la Alhambra\\". Oldfield's work on the score was partially instigated by Virgin boss Richard Branson when he took Oldfield to see David Puttnam, a producer on the film, which then secured him the role. Oldfield spent six months working on the score for The Killing Fields before going on tour, but when Oldfield returned, the producers of the film asked for more music to be written, prompting Oldfield to ask for the use of an orchestra and a choir; three months later the score was finished. It was released just a few months after Oldfield's previous album, Discovery.

It is generally considered endemic to the humid Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil, but there are two unconfirmed records from Misiones in Argentina. It occurs up to 1000 m. (3300 ft). It is a relatively long-tailed parrot with a total length of c. 28 cm. (11 in). It is green overall and the beak is whitish. Only the male has the bluish-purple patch on the belly for which this species is named. It has a whistled call and pairs will sing in duet, but it is typically fairly quiet and therefore easily overlooked. It has been recorded feeding on seeds, fruits, flower buds, nectar and some insects. The nest is placed in the cavity of a large tree or palm. It nests between September (October in Rio Grande do Sul) and January. The pair is highly territorial during the breeding season. Much of the original forest cover in its range has been removed in favour of cultivated crops like tobacco and bananas. Now mostly restricted to remnant forest strips on slopes and ridges, which cover far less than 10% of the original range. Previously, it was believed that 5,000‚Äì10,000 birds survived, but recent evidence suggests that c. 10,000 survive in the state of Rio Grande do Sul alone. Significant populations also exists in the states of Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo, but population estimates for these are not available. Regardless, numbers are dwindling throughout its range due to further habitat changes.

The Sanskrit word ‚ÄòShaastra‚Äô means science and the festival accordingly consists of various engineering, science and technology competitions, summits, lectures, video conferences, exhibitions, demonstrations and workshops. The festival is traditionally held over four days and four nights during the first week of January. It has so far seen twenty one editions, having started in its current avatar in the year 2000. Shaastra attracts participation from all over India, and seeks to provide collegiate students with a platform to showcase their scientific and engineering talents. Shaastra is entirely student managed and is the first such event in the world to be ISO 9001:2015 certified for implementing a Quality Management System. It is one of Asia's largest completely student-run techno-managerial festivals.  History  In 1996, Prof. R Natarajan took over as director and instituted several committees to study several ways of improving IIT Madras. One of his committees, the committee on new mechanisms of Teacher Learning Interactions, was tasked with coming up with ways of inspiring students. This committee, headed by Prof. Ajit Kumar Kolar, came up with a suggestion to create a technology festival in IIT Madras. On the behest of Prof. U R Rao, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Institute, in 1997, several students came together and staged 'Pragmaa', a technical festival, in 1997, and then in 1999. Students applied for and took on the role of Coordinators for various events. A set of colleges around the country was targeted and the amount required to run the event was raised through sponsorship agreements. The first edition of Shaastra was thus planned and took place starting 9 March 2000. Since then, Shaastra has continued to expand year by year, and has established itself as one of the premiermost technical fest in India. The latest edition of Shaastra, was held in January 2020, with the theme 'Parsec to Planck'. The 2020 edition of Shaastra saw prominent speakers including Dr. V.K. Saraswat, Mr. Suresh Prabhu, Mr. Robin Li, Arunachalam Muruganathan and Dr. C. Rangarajan.  Current edition  With the Covid-19 global pandemic, Shaastra 2021 shifted partially to hold events online, with their biggest event yet being the Spotlight Stay@Home Series [1] on their YouTube channel[2], featuring the likes of Dr. Madhavan Nair, Mr. Prasanth Chandrasekhar, Dr. Anil Kakodkar and culminating with the former RBI governor Dr. Raghuram Rajan.

Bottom-dwelling in nature, it generally inhabits cool waters deep, but it also frequently enters shallower water in areas such as Monterey Bay off California. This stocky, dark-colored shark grows up to long, with two small dorsal fins positioned far back on its body and no anal fin. It is characterized by a dense covering of thorn-like dermal denticles, hence its common name. Nocturnally active, the prickly shark rests during the day in deeper offshore waters and performs a diel migration to shallower inshore waters at dusk. Individual sharks have a small home range and tend to remain within a given local area. This species consumes a variety of bony and cartilaginous fishes, and cephalopods. Since it moves slowly, it may use suction to capture prey. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing sizable litters. The prickly shark is not known to be dangerous to humans and has minimal economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial deepwater fisheries, which are expanding and may potentially threaten its population. Thus, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Data Deficient. Taxonomy Austrian ichthyologist Viktor Pietschmann described the prickly shark as a new species in two separate publications: a brief German account in a 1928 volume of Anzeiger der Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien and a more detailed English account in a 1930 volume of Bishop Museum Bulletins. Pietschmann named the shark in honor of C. Montague Cooke Jr., a conchologist at the Bishop Museum. However, prickly sharks were continually misidentified as bramble sharks (E. brucus) and referred to as such in scientific literature until 1960, when Jack Garrick redescribed the species. Since the original holotype from Kauai, Hawaii had been lost, Garrick designated a long male from Palliser Bay, New Zealand as a new type specimen. Other common names for this species include Cook's bramble shark and spinous shark. Description The prickly shark has a flabby and cylindrical body, with the adults markedly bulkier than juveniles, and a short, moderately flattened head. The nostrils are placed far apart and preceded by small flaps of skin. The spiracles are tiny and positioned well behind the eyes, which lack nictitating membranes. The mouth forms a broad arch, with very short furrows at the corners. There are 21‚Äì25 and 20‚Äì27 tooth rows in the upper and lower jaws respectively. The knife-like teeth each have a strongly angled main cusp flanked by up to three smaller cusplets on either side; the lateral cusplets are absent in young sharks. There are five pairs of gill slits, with the fifth pair the longest. The lateral line runs along each side of body in a conspicuous furrow. The pectoral fins are short, while the pelvic fins are relatively large with long bases. The first dorsal fin is small and originates at or behind the level of the pelvic fin origins; the second dorsal fin is similar to the first and positioned close behind. The anal fin is absent, and the stout caudal peduncle lacks depressions at the caudal fin origins. The caudal fin has a longer upper lobe without a notch in the trailing margin, and an indistinct lower lobe. The skin has a dense, uniform covering of non-overlapping dermal denticles measuring up to across, which are never fused together as in the bramble shark. Each denticle is thorn-like, with strong ridges running down the central spine and radiating out over the star-shaped base. The denticles beneath the snout are very fine in adults. The prickly shark is plain brown or gray, often with a purplish tint, and has black trailing margins on the fins. The underside is paler, most obviously on the snout and around the mouth. It may reach a length of . The maximum recorded weight is for a long female. Echinorhinus cookei head2.jpgHead Echinorhinus cookei head.jpgHead, bottom view Echinorhinus cookei jaws.jpg Jaws Echinorhinus cookei upper teeth.jpgUpper teeth Echinorhinus cookei lower teeth.jpgLower teeth Distribution and habitat The prickly shark is widely distributed around the Pacific Ocean. In the western and central Pacific, it has been reported off Japan, Taiwan, Victoria and Queensland in Australia, and New Zealand, as well as around the islands of Palau, New Caledonia, Tonga, Hawaii, and possibly the Gilberts. In the eastern Pacific, it is known to occur from Oregon to El Salvador (including the Gulf of California), around the Cocos and Galapagos Islands, and off Peru and Chile. This species generally seems to be uncommon; an exception is in Monterey Canyon off California, where sharks of both sexes are abundant throughout the year. Favoring cooler temperatures of , the prickly shark is mostly found below depths of , particularly in the tropics. It has been recorded from at least down and may occur much deeper, possibly to . On the other hand, at higher latitudes it frequently enters shallow inshore waters; for example, in Monterey Canyon it can be consistently found at depths of , and off Moss Landing one individual was captured in water only deep. This shark inhabits continental and insular shelves and slopes, where it swims close to the bottom. It can also be found inside submarine canyons, close to the walls. It prefers areas with a muddy or sandy substrate. It is tolerant of low dissolved oxygen levels, allowing it to inhabit oceanic basins inaccessible to other sharks. Biology and ecology The prickly shark and the bluntnose sixgill shark (pictured) prey on each other's young. The prickly shark is a slow swimmer and has been observed hovering just above the sea floor. A tracking study in Monterey Canyon found that this species exhibits strong diel migration patterns. The sharks were inactive during the day, resting in discrete refuge areas located near the sea floor in deep, offshore waters. They became active at dusk, swimming towards the coast to the head of the canyon and rising into the water column; this upward movement is likely related to feeding on schooling fishes. Individual sharks seldom strayed from the local area and had very small home ranges, no more than . The prickly sharks in Monterey Canyon regularly form aggregations that may number over thirty. The size and structure of the prickly shark's mouth and pharynx suggests that it uses suction to capture prey. This species feeds on a variety of benthic and pelagic bony fishes, including hake, flounders, rockfishes, lingcod, topsmelt, mackerel, and herring, and on cartilaginous fishes, including elephantfishes (Callorhinchus), spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), young bluntnose sixgill sharks (Hexanchus griseus), and ghost catshark (Apristurus) egg cases. Octopuses and squid, including the Humboldt squid (Dosidicus gigas) are also consumed. Young prickly sharks may themselves fall prey to the bluntnose sixgill shark, while adults likely face few threats. Reproduction in this species is aplacental viviparous, with the unborn young sustained by yolk. There is only one known record of a pregnant female, which was gestating 114 embryos; this ranks among the largest known litters from any shark. The young are probably under long at birth. The length at sexual maturity has not been precisely determined but is thought to be around for males and for females. Human interactions Interactions with divers show that the prickly shark behaves inoffensively towards humans, either tolerating contact or fleeing when closely approached. It is susceptible to incidental capture by commercial bottom trawls, gillnets, or line gear. It has little commercial value since the meat is soft and poorly regarded.  Conservation status  In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the prickly shark as \\"At Risk ‚Äì Naturally Uncommon\\" with the qualifiers \\"Data Poor\\" and \\"Secure Overseas\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the prickly shark as Data Deficient, citing its patchy known distribution and the continuing expansion of deepwater fisheries.

It housed the workers who constructed and decorated the tombs of the city's elite, making it comparable to the better studied Theban workers village of Deir el-Medina. While today an isolated part of the Akhetaten site, the Workmen's Village helps provide many well preserved artifacts and buildings allowing archaeologists to gather much information about how the society functioned.  Excavation history  The Workmen's Village has been known since the surveys of Petrie, but was first excavated in 1921 by the Egypt Exploration Society. At this time it was known as the Eastern Village. Two seasons of excavation were undertaken by T. Eric Peet and Leonard Woolley; the first season excavated four houses as a test of the site and the second season excavated approximately half of the village. Some of the tomb chapels that surround the village were also excavated. The Egypt Exploration Society resumed excavations in 1979 led by Barry Kemp and concluded in 1986. These excavations focused on the areas immediately surrounding the walled village.  Walled village  The village is located on the floor of a Y-shaped valley. The South Tombs, which are within easy walking distance, are the only part of the city directly visible from this isolated location. The walled village from which the settlement takes its name occupies an area of approximately 70 square meters and is surrounded by an outer wall 75 to 80 cm thick. It has a single entrance on the southern side and is divided into two unequal halves by an equally thick inner wall. Seventy-three houses of identical size are found inside this area, with one larger house with its own garden that presumably belonged to an official overseer. Each house was 5 meters wide and 10 meters long, and constructed of mudbrick with some stone used around the base of the walls. Thresholds were often made of cut stone but no stone walls were found. The interior was divided into four main rooms: the \\"entrance hall\\", \\"living room\\", \\"bedroom\\", and \\"kitchen\\". Stairs, located either in front or rear of the house, led up to a second floor. In some houses the walls had been preserved to a height of 1.8 meters. Windows are not preserved but were likely small and high up to let in light but minimize dust. The interiors were once decorated but little survives. Panels of colour were found to begin about 20 from the floor in some houses. The best preserved decoration depicts dancing figures of Bes along with the goddess Taweret, and in a separate house a scene of women and girls who may be musicians or dancers. Finds from within the houses are consistent with everyday life: amulets, beads, fragments of matting, spindle whorls, rings, headrests, and pottery. The village contains no well so water along with food stuffs and animal fodder must have been brought in from the city. The likely distribution point is close to a building on the edge of town that probably served as a checkpoint. There is evidence that animals were kept both inside and immediately outside the village. This evidence comes in the form of animal pens in the south-western part of the village and mangers in the main street, as well as buildings directly in front of the village and to the east. The remains of cow, pig, and goat were found in the rubbish dumps. The limited range of cattle bones recovered indicates that joints of beef were likely part of the rations and that they were not being raised on-site. Pigs, fed grain, were raised in covered pens, and goats, fed vegetable material, were raised in separate areas surrounding the village. The inhabitants also made attempts to garden in the areas below and between the chapels outside the village. The fact the villagers were going to such efforts to try to be partially self- sufficient indicates that the state had a limited role in providing for the needs of the people. It can be postulated that the villagers used the animals they raised to pay for the extra water and grain needed for the animals.  Chapels and their wall paintings  Outside of the walled portion of the village approximately twenty-three chapels were built along the hillside. These chapels are generally composed of mudbrick and limestone for their construction and varied considerably in their layout. The essential features found in the more complex examples were an outer court, an inner court, and a shrine with niches. Comparison with the chapels at Deir el Medina clarify the purpose of the chapels in this village. They appear not to have been built as funerary chapels initially, but as places where divinities or family members could be worshiped, and as places where special meals could be prepared and eaten. Deliberate cut marks have been found on the floors and benches of the Main Chapel; it is possible this is a result of people obtaining holy dust for inclusion in spells or potions or they were made by javelins in an effort to absorb holy power. This is suggested by the find of a bronze javelin in the Outer Hall of the Main Chapel. =The Main Chapel= The Main Chapel, located to the southeast of the walled village, is the largest and best understood, having been protected from robbers by piles of spoil from the excavations in the 1920s. It was built in the last stage of the occupation of the village, during the reign of Tutankhamun given it partly overlies earlier construction in the stratigraphy. The structure had two entrances: a formal one to the east and another further to the south which was probably for everyday use. The formal entrance seems to have had a pylon structure, while the southern entrance was approached by a line of T-shaped basins set into the ground. The chapel had several annexes for cooking and for housing animals. This chapel is most well known for its colourful paintings which survive as fragments. The majority of the paintings had a yellow background, although some also occurred on a white ground. Decoration from the Sanctuary included two vultures grasping shen rings and feather fans, and a winged sun disc, and bouquets, all likely from the east wall, above the shrine doorways. At least one vulture had a vertical chequered border. No direct evidence was present for what design occurred above the vultures but evidence of a blue band of lotus petals topped by a chequer pattern is present in association with the sun disc; it is likely this decorative scheme occurred above the vultures as well. The remains of striped cavetto cornices were also found. Long-stemmed lotus flowers were also found and again probably originated from the east wall, or perhaps from the small pylons to the west. Friezes of looped open lotuses and buds also occurred but it is uncertain if these connected to the other lotus petal frieze. The paint was applied to plaster made of alluvial mud mixed with chopped straw. The decoration of the Inner Hall featured chequered and looped lotus friezes, semi-circular garlands, male and female figures, and hieroglyphs. Paintings from the north wall are the best preserved. The faces are painted in the conventional Theban style and do not show any of the distortions associated with the Amarna Period art style. However, this is not unique to the Main Chapel, as conventional offering scenes in the conventional style are found in the innermost parts of the tomb of Huya, Panehesy, and Any. The woman wears a long wig with a fillet of lotus petals and cornflowers and topped by an incense cone while the man wears a short Nubian-style wig likewise topped with a perfume cone; both hold bouquets. They were likely seated before an offering table, of which no trace survives. Fragments of smaller-scale figures indicate there were other standing figures, likely a chantress and another woman. The south wall was less well preserved but likely featured a complimentary scene painted on a yellow ground; these figures are presumed to have been depicted standing. Few decorated fragments survived from the Outer Hall but its design appears to have featured garlands, friezes, and figures. Designs of grape trellises and bouquets feature in the Side Chapel, along with a scene of flying ducks. The Main Chapel was likely built to commemorate a man named Sennefer, whose name appears over the head of a male figure; based on the fragmentary hieroglyphic inscription, he may have been a scribe. =Purpose= The purpose of the chapel was, as with other New Kingdom chapels, to ‚Äúexperience a sense of communion with spirits‚Äù. Weatherhead and Kemp elaborate as follows: > The Workmen's Village chapels... show that people really did prepare and eat > meals in spiritually charged locations... At the Amarna Workmen's Village > (and at Deir el-Medina) the local combination of a small and prescribed > house size and abundant external space allowed people to think more > expansively and to build separate places - the chapels - which satisfied > both the desire to express spirituality and the convenient accommodation of > the feasting element of honouring the spiritual essence of family headship, > that included ancestors... By this view, the Workmen's Village chapels are > the product of contingency: the isolation of the village and its cramped > interior, the unusual closeness of its cemetery, and the existence of much > open space brought out within the villagers a fuller architectural > expression of spiritual communion, combining meals with commemoration, than > was open to people of similar or even higher social standing within the city > proper. Cemetery Excavation by Peet and Woolley on the slopes above the chapels uncovered nine tomb shafts, of which four had never been completed. Two appear to have contained burials as fragments of a coffin, pottery, and the later internment of a child were encountered in one, and animal remains and pottery in the other. The rock is of such poor quality that sinking a tomb shaft and erecting a chapel over top of it proved impossible; the shafts were sunk at some distance from the chapels, on a ridge. Given that the chapels and tombs can be separated by up to , it is difficult to associate a shaft with a particular chapel.  Significance of this village  In general, the site of Akhetaten dedicates the vast majority of wall painting to not only displaying the royal family alongside the Aten but also to showcasing the daily lives of the citizens as being prosperous, joyful, and above all lively. Since the majority of these depictions in the main city are destroyed with very little fragments left behind, the Workmen's Village's greater preservation provides a better chance for archaeologists to understand everyday life during the Amarna Period. = Religious significance = During Akhenaten's reign, the god Aten was elevated above all others. The worship of other gods was suppressed and their temples closed; Amun received the harshest treatment, with his name eventually being hacked out where it occurred. Akhenaten's devotion to the Aten culminated with his reforms of Egyptian religion in the cult of the royal family who are the sole intermediaries between the populace and the Aten and the founding of the city of Akhetaten. It appears that the general population continued their traditional worship of household gods like Bes and Taweret, with amulets of both and a stele of Taweret being found in the city itself. To this end it is interesting to note that the name of Amun appears in painted fragments from the Main Chapel and another, Chapel 529. The fragments from the Main Chapel are in the \\"Htp-di-nswt\\" format and call Amun the \\"good ruler eternally, lord of heaven, who made the whole earth.\\" Additionally, a wooden top for a military standard depicting Wepwawet was found in the sanctuary. In Chapel 525 two stelae were found. The smaller of the two depicts the god Shed, who is called \\"the great god, the Lord of the Two Lands\\", while the larger one addresses funerary prayers to Shed and the goddess Isis in addition to the Aten. This larger stele is inscribed for a man named Ptah-may, who is the \\"praised one of the Living Aten\\", and his family. Peet and Woolley suggested that the worship of the traditional gods continued throughout the reign of Akhenaten, and that the distance separating the Workmen's Village from the main city afforded it more freedom in this regard. They also interpret the presence of the name of Amun as an indication that the decoration dates to the early reign of Tutankhamun, when orthodoxy was returning. More recently, Weatherhead and Kemp suggest that the use of the traditional art style instead of the court style in the decoration of the chapels indicates a separation between public life, with its displays of loyalty to the king, and private life, where expressions of grief and commemoration remained largely unchanged and traditional. This is taken to indicate that the Aten cult and iconography had limited penetration into the lives of the general populace.

He was voted a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1997. In his career in first-class cricket, he averaged 35.61 with the bat and 28.68 with the ball. During the 1996 season with Leicestershire, he accumulated 1244 runs and took 56 wickets and 35 catches, helping his side to win the County Championship that year for only the second time in their history. International career Like many cricketers before him, he found the transition to Test level difficult, although he proved more adept to at the international one day game by scoring 2 half centuries in w.c. 1987 at beginning of his O.D.I career ( 50 runs off 57 balls at his debut match vs Pakistan & 89 runs off 126 balls vs Sri Lanka. For the 1992 World Cup, Simmons played in 4 matches, (v Zimbabwe, he scored 21 runs off 45 balls, v India, he scored 20 runs off 22 balls, v Sri Lanka, he scored 110 runs off 125 balls and v Australia, he scored none). At Sharjah's Champions Trophy tri-series in 1993, Simmons was named player of the series by scoring 3 half centuries and 330 runs for the series. For the 1995/96 World Series Cup, which also included hosts Australia and Sri Lanka, Simmons failed to impress through his all round performances which cost him his place for the World Cup which was held in Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka. In December 1992, during the 8th match of the Benson & Hedges World Series tournament, Simmons won the Man of the Match award for his match-winning spell of 10 overs, 8 maidens, 3 runs, 4 wickets, with an economy of 0.30, against Pakistan. With this, Simmons holds the world record for most economical (conceding less runs) bowling in an ODI among those who completed their maximum quota of overs (10 overs in a 50-over match). In 1993's Sharjah Champions Trophy tri-series which included Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Simmons scored 3 half centuries, 2 of them against Sri Lanka, 92 runs off 161 balls and 90 runs off 109 balls and 1 against Pakistan, 81 runs off 94 balls. Simmons was named player of the series for his 330 runs with the bat. Serious injury During a 1988 tour match against Gloucestershire on his debut tour of England, he was struck on the head by a fast ball from David Lawrence in bad light at Bristol. His heart stopped and he required emergency surgery at Frenchay Hospital, from which he recovered fully. Coaching career Simmons retired from playing in 2002, then embarked on a successful coaching career. He was first appointed as the head coach to the Zimbabwe cricket team in 2004. This proved a difficult and controversial job, not least because he inherited a team heavily weakened thanks to the mass dismissal of most of the senior players. He found himself having to defend the Test status of his country after an appalling losing streak, including a loss to Bangladesh who were widely seen as the worst Test side in the world. The Zimbabwe cricket union made him a scapegoat for the problems in the side and he was sacked under farcical conditions in August 2005 after persistent rumours of his impending dismissal. The official notice of his removal was dated two days before it was actually released. Many commentators felt that he was simply too kindly and naive to have succeeded in such a difficult position. Simmons succeeded Adrian Birrell as coach of the Ireland national cricket team after the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup. Simmons significantly improved Ireland's standing in world cricket as their coach. His tenure included 224 matches, making him the longest serving coach in international cricket. During that time, Ireland won 11 trophies, qualified for every major ICC event, and achieved victories over Pakistan and Bangladesh at the 2007 World Cup, England at the 2011 World Cup and the West Indies and Zimbabwe at the 2015 World Cup. In March 2015, he accepted an offer to coach to take charge of his native West Indies after the conclusion of the 2015 World Cup. WICB chief executive Michael Muirhead said of his signing, \\"Phil has a proven ability to develop players, while cultivating great team spirit and a winning culture, we have a number of young, talented players about whom he is excited to be coaching and we believe he is the right fit\\". In 2016 he led the West Indies team to a historic second T20 world cup victory in India. At the time the former top ranking cricket team was in a period of significant struggles, and he was tasked with bringing the team from near the bottom of the top ten rankings and back into prominence. He was the batting coach for Afghanistan national cricket team and later on was appointed as the head coach in 2017. In June 2019, he was named as the coach of the Brampton Wolves franchise team for the 2019 Global T20 Canada tournament. In October 2019 he was reappointed as the head coach of the West Indies team.  Personal life  Phil Simmons is a fan of English football club Tottenham Hotspur.http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/spurs-tv/features/west-indies-pair- bowled-over-at-the-lane/ His nephew Lendl Simmons is also a West Indian cricket player.

Other Disney Villains on AFI's list were Hunter from Bambi and Cruella de Vil from 101 Dalmatians. AFI did not rely on Disney's classification of who qualified as a villain, but used this definition instead: > a \\"villain\\" was defined as a character(s) whose wickedness of mind, > selfishness of character and will to power are sometimes masked by beauty > and nobility, while others may rage unmasked. They can be horribly evil or > grandiosely funny, but are ultimately tragic.

Club career Svenssen was a tall and strong central defender who played his entire career for his hometown team Sandefjord. At club level, Svenssen played 22 seasons for Sandefjord, but never won any major trophies (Sandefjord finished second in the league in 1955‚Äì56). However, he did play twice in the Norwegian cup final (1957 and 1959), finishing on the losing side both times. His steady and solid play at the back earned him the nickname \\"Klippen\\" (\\"The Rock\\"). International career Svenssen made his international debut on 11 June 1947, in a friendly against Poland. He remained virtually ever-present in the national side throughout the next decade and a half.

He was appointed definitor general to Rome for the Capuchins in 1596; Pope Clement VIII assigned him the task of preaching to the Jews in the city. He was sufficiently proficient in Hebrew that the rabbis assumed he had been a convert from Judaism. Beginning in 1599, Lawrence established Capuchin monasteries in modern Germany and Austria, furthering the Counter-Reformation and bringing many Protestants back to the Catholic faith.Andrew J.G.

He then led the army during the brief liberation of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r in Hungary from the Ottoman Empire, armed only with a crucifix. In 1602, he was elected vicar general of the Capuchin friars, at that time the highest office in the Order. He was elected again in 1605, but refused the office. He entered the service of the Holy See, becoming papal nuncio to Bavaria. After serving as nuncio to Spain, he retired to a monastery in 1618. He was recalled as a special envoy to the King of Spain regarding the actions of the Viceroy of Naples in 1619, and after finishing his mission, died on his birthday in Lisbon.

A very similar flag had represented the Party beginning in 1920. The swastika The Nazis' principal symbol was the swastika, which the newly established Nazi Party formally adopted in 1920. The emblem was a black swastika (Âçê) rotated 45 degrees on a white circle on a red background. This insignia was used on the party's flag, badge, and armband. Similar shaped swastikas were seen in United States postcards wishing people good luck in the early 1900s.https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/40942247_1910-good-luck- swastika-postcardhttps://www.cardcow.com/808515/good-luck-swastika-swastikas/ The black-white-red motif is based on the colours of the flags of the German Empire. This colour scheme was commonly associated with anti-Weimar German nationalists, following the fall of the German Empire.Hilmar Hoffmann, John Broadwin, Volker R. Berghahn. The Triumph of Propaganda: Film and National Socialism, 1933‚Äì1945. Berghahn Books, 1997. Pp. 16. The Nazis denounced the black-red-gold flag of the Weimar republic (the current flag of Germany). In ' Adolf Hitler described the symbolism of the Nazi flag: \\"The red expressed the social thought underlying the movement. White the national thought. And the swastika signified the mission allotted to us-the struggle for the victory of Aryan mankind and at the same time the triumph of the ideal of creative work ...\\" Today, certain countries such as Germany (see section 86a), Austria, France, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Ukraine, Brazil, and Israel have banned Nazi symbols and it is considered a criminal offence if they are displayed publicly for non-educational purposes. On August 9, 2018, Germany lifted the ban on the usage of swastikas and other Nazi symbols in video games. \\"Through the change in the interpretation of the law, games that critically look at current affairs can for the first time be given a USK age rating,\\" USK managing director Elisabeth Secker told CTV. \\"This has long been the case for films and with regards to the freedom of the arts, this is now rightly also the case with computer and videogames.\\" Heraldry Under the Nazi regime, government bodies were encouraged to remove religious symbolism from their heraldry. Symbols such as crosses, saints, etc. were seen as upsetting to the Nazis; however, few German councils actually changed their often ancient symbols. Some, however, did, including Coburg, which replaced the Maure on their arms with a sword and swastika, and Thuringia, which added a swastika to the paws of their lion. Nazi occultists Karl Maria Wiligut and Guido von List both claimed that heraldry began in the world of the Germanic gods, and was created by Wotan, the god of war. Other symbols Other symbols employed by the Nazis include: * The eagle atop swastika (German: Parteiadler), the formal symbol of the Nazi Party * The SS bolts, the runic insignia of the * Various runes from the runic script, such as the Odal/Othala, Algiz/Leben, Tyr/Tiwaz runes and other rune-like symbols such as the * The black SS uniform * The brown shirts of the * The death's head insignia of the and concentration camp units * The Black Sun (German: Schwarze Sonne/Sonnenrad) used by Heinrich Himmler of the SS. * The crossed hammer and sword of Strasserism, a strand of Nazism that has an anti-capitalist and socialist ideology. * The broken sun cross swastika. Runic letters Letters of the historical runic alphabet and the modern Armanen runes have been used by Nazism and neo-Nazi groups that associate themselves with Germanic traditions, mainly the Sigel, Eihwaz, Tyr;Symbols.com - Symbol 4:22 c.f. Odal (see Odalism) and Algiz runes. The fascination that runes seem to have exerted on the Nazis can be traced to the occult and author , one of the important figures in Germanic mysticism and runic revivalism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1908, List published in ' (\\"The Secret of the Runes\\") a set of 18 so-called \\"Armanen Runes\\", based on the Younger Futhark, which were allegedly revealed to him in a state of temporary blindness after a cataract operation on both eyes in 1902. In Nazi contexts, the s-rune is referred to as \\"Sig\\" (after List, probably from Anglo-Saxon '). The \\"\\", while not a rune historically, has the shape of List's \\"Gibor\\" rune. Runic \\"SS\\" was the symbol of the Schutzstaffel. Usages by neo-Nazi groups Many symbols used by the Nazis have further been appropriated by neo-Nazi groups, including a number of runes. Neo-Nazis however also employ various number symbols such as: * 18, code for Adolf Hitler. The number comes from the position of the letters in the alphabet: A = 1, H = 8. * 88, code for 88 Precepts. A manifesto written by David Lane, a late 20th-century American white supremacist, on the proper organization of a white nationalist nation, 88 Precepts is a treatise on natural law, religion and politics. However, according to the Anti-Defamation League, it is code for Heil Hitler. Again, the number comes from the position of the letter H in the Latin alphabet. * 14, from the Fourteen Words coined by David Lane: \\"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\\" * 14 and 88 are sometimes combined with each other (i.e. 14/88, 8814, 1488). They are also sometimes depicted on dice. *Celtic Cross, originally a symbol used to represent pre-Christian and Christian European groups such as the Irish post- World War II it has been used by many neo-Nazi groups.

It is situated about 60 km south-west of Mysuru and about 150 km south of Bengaluru on National Highway NH 209. In history it was called as Ramachndra yelanbure. Later on it changed into Yalandur.  Historic importance  It was under the rule of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th and 16th centuries. When it came under the rule of Wadiyar dynasty of Mysuru, in the early 18th century, Dewan Purnaiah, a notable Dewan of Kingdom of Mysore from here, was gifted the Jagir of Yalandur and its surrounding villages by Krishnaraja Wodeyar III - the King of Mysuru, in appreciation of the great service rendered to the Mysuru State by Purnaiah as Dewan or the Prime Minister. Purnaiah was instrumental in making the Mysore State into a strong empire and greatly admired, as son of the soil, for having developed the region with several visionary works.  Temples  The Gaurishvara temple is one of the main temples in the town Gaurishvara temple was built in 1550 A.D during the reign of Devabhupala (Singadepa). This temple was rebuilt in 1654 -1655 by Muddabhupa, grand son Devabhupala, as the old temple was highly dilapidated. The temple has some unique features which makes it very distinctive. Though there is no towering entrance gopura (as is common in South Indian temples), it has a mahadwara or gate called \\"Bale Mantapa\\" (Bangle entrance) which has exquisitely stone carved themes, on the walls and pillars, depicting mythological stories of Andhakasura (slaying of demon Andhakasura), Narasimha (half man ‚Äì half lion god) in various manifestations of Dakshinamurthy and Sharaba, Bhairava, Kalingamardhana Krishna, Vali and Sugriva. Monolithic stone chains (stone carved rings - 20 cm each) adorn the four corners and the door side of the entrance which gives the name of Bale (Bangle) Mantapa to the temple entrance. Another important temple in the town is Varahaswamy Temple. Varaha is the third avatar of Vishnu. A very rare temple of this kind. Every year on the day of Holi, a festival of colors there will be a procession of God varaha in around the temple. One more curious thing in the temple is the idol Ganesha which is there in south-west corner, is believed to be more worshiped God in the town. It is a very small idol and there is evidence that it is growing in the shape of Ganesha. The famous Kannada poet Sri Shadakshara was from Yalandur.

He was involved with research and wrote many books and scientific articles.  Early life  Hart was born in London on 9 March 1927, the son of Dr Alexander Tudor-Hart and Dr Alison Macbeth. He studied medicine at Cambridge University and in London, graduating in 1952. He is a descendant of American businessman Frederic Tudor and Ephraim Hart, a Bavarian Jew who became a prominent merchant in New York, and was reportedly partners with John Jacob Astor. The name was originally Hirz. His paternal grandfather, the Canadian artist Percyval Hart, married his Polish-French cousin √âl√©onora D√©lia Julie Aim√©e Hart Kleczkowska, and later changed the family surname to Tudor-Hart. Kleczkowska was the daughter of diplomat Michel Alexandre Cholewa, comte Kleczkowski (Micha≈Ç Kleczkowski; 1818‚Äì1886) and granddaughter of Julie Sobieska, a direct descendant of John III Sobieski, king of Poland in the 17th century. He was a member of the Sigerist Society from 1947 to 1955. Hart joined the Communist Party of Great Britain, following his father Alex, and stood unsuccessfully as the CPGB candidate for Aberavon at the 1964, 1966 and 1970 general elections.Graham Stevenson, \\"Tudor Hart Julian\\", Compendium of Communist Biography Career He worked for 30 years as a general practitioner in Glyncorrwg, West Glamorgan, Wales, where one of his partners was Dr Brian Gibbons, later minister for health in Wales. Hart became involved in epidemiological research, with Richard Doll and Archie Cochrane. He was a passionate advocate of the National Health Service and of socialism. He was President of the Socialist Health Association. He was a Fellow of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and the Royal College of Physicians (RCP). In 2006, he was awarded the inaugural Discovery Prize by the RCGP as \\"a general practitioner who has captured the imagination of generations of GPs with his groundbreaking research\\". His practice in Glyncorrwg, Wales, was the first in the UK to be recognised as a research practice, piloting many Medical Research Council studies. He was also the first doctor to routinely measure every patient's blood pressure and as a result was able to reduce premature mortality in high risk patients at his practice by 30%. Graham Watt, Professor of General Practice at the University of Glasgow, nominated Dr Tudor Hart for the award. Professor Watt said: \\"His ideas and example pervade modern general practice and remain at the cutting edge of thinking and practice concerning health improvement in primary care. His work on hypertension showed how high quality records, teamwork and audit are the keys to health improvement. His life-long commitment to the daily tasks of general practice has always given his work and views a salience and credibility with fellow general practitioners. Julian Tudor Hart has been and will remain an inspiration to health practitioners and the communities they serve.\\" Hart died on 1 July 2018 at the age of 91 years.  Author  He wrote many books and scientific articles. His last book, The Political Economy of Health Care: A Clinical Perspective explores how the NHS might be reconstituted as a humane service for all (rather than a profitable one for the few) and a civilising influence on society as a whole. The book provides 'a big picture' for students, academics, health professionals and NHS users that Tudor Hart hopes will inspire them to challenge received wisdoms about how the NHS should develop in the 21st century. Hart lists nine (9) characteristics of the National Health Service in its founding that are distinctive and essential to it. # A united national service devoted directly and indirectly to care, fully available to all citizens. # A gift economy including everyone, funded by general taxation, of which the largest component was income tax. # Its most important inputs and processes are personal interactions between lay and professional people. # Its products were potentially measurable as health gains for the whole population. # Its staff and component units were not expected to compete for market share but to co-operate to maximise useful service. # Continuity was central to its efficiency and effectiveness. # Its local staff and local populations believed they had moral ownership of and loyalty to neighbourhood NHS units. # None of its decisions and few of its procedures could be fully standardised. All of its decisions entailed some uncertainty and doubt. They were therefore unsuited to commodity form, either for personal sale or for long-term contracts. # The NHS was a labour-intensive economy. Every new diagnostic or therapeutic machine generates new needs for more skilled staff able to control and interpret the work of the machines and translate them into human terms. His other writing includes many articles on the management of high blood pressure and on the organisation of health services. His most influential, The Inverse Care Law, published in the Lancet 1971 asserts: \\"The availability of good medical care tends to vary inversely with the need for the population served. This inverse care law operates more completely where medical care is most exposed to market forces, and less so where such exposure is reduced.\\" Publications = Scientific articles =     * Hart JT. \\"Two paths for medical practice.

The series are produced by GE Aviation. Partners include Volvo Aero, which builds the RM12 variant. The F404 was developed into the larger F414 turbofan, as well as the experimental GE36 civil propfan. Design and development =F404= GE developed the F404 for the F/A-18 Hornet, shortly after losing the competition for the F-15 Eagle's engine to Pratt & Whitney, and losing the Lightweight Fighter (LWF) competition to the Pratt & Whitney F100 powered YF-16. For the F/A-18, GE based the F404 on the YJ101 engine they had developed for the Northrop YF-17, enlarging the bypass ratio from .20 to .34 to enable higher fuel economy. The engine was designed with a higher priority on reliability than performance. Cost was the main goal in the design of the engine.Spick, Mike ed, Great Book of Modern Warplanes, pp. 274-278. MBI, 2000. . GE also analyzed \\"throttle profiles\\" and found that pilots were changing throttle settings far more often than engineers previously expected; putting undue stress on the engines. GE also sought with the F404 a design that would avoid compressor stalls and other engine failures, and would respond quickly to control inputs; a common complaint of pilots converting from propeller planes to jets were that early turbojets were not responsive to changes in thrust input. GE executives Frederick A. Larson and Paul Setts also set the goal that the new engine would be smaller than the F-4's GE J79, but provide at least as much thrust, and cost half as much as the P&W; F100 engine for the F-16. Due to a fan designed to smooth airflow before it enters the compressor, the F404 has high resistance to compressor stalls, even at high angles of attack. It requires less than two shop visits per 1,000 flight hours and averages 6,500 hours between in-flight events. It also demonstrates high responsiveness to control inputs, spooling from idle to full afterburner in 4 seconds. The engine contains an in-flight engine condition monitoring system (IECMS) that monitors for critical malfunctions and keeps track of parts lifetimes.Jenkins 2000, p. 144. GE developed the F110 for the Air Force as an alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F100 for use on the F-16 and F-15 based on the F101 and used F404 technology.GEAE: F110 Engine GE developed the F404-GE-402 in response to a Swiss requirement for more power in its F/A-18 version. The new engine version was used on Kuwaiti Hornets, later U.S. C and D Hornets, and subsequent Hornets.Jenkins 2000, pp. 62,-63 93, 97. The KAI T-50 Golden Eagle uses a single General Electric F404-102 turbofan engine with Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system.

Shown under repair M4 Sherman disabled by an anti-tank mine and five hits by Japanese artillery during the Battle of Iwo Jima in 1945 A mobility kill (or M-kill) in armoured warfare is a weapon or vehicle that is immobilized, or the act of immobilizing such a target. This is often caused by the vehicle triggering an anti-tank mine by driving over it, though it may also result from being hit by a rocket propelled grenade or anti-tank missile. Tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles can be immobilized by damage to their engines, tracks, or running gear. Because of the mobile nature of modern warfare, such a vehicle is often effectively useless on the battlefield, though it may later be salvaged for spares, or repaired and brought back into action. In rare cases, tanks that have suffered mobility kills have continued to engage enemy targets with their main gun, even though they are immobile. However, in an active battlefield situation any armoured fighting vehicles which have suffered mobility kills are stationary targets for ground-attack planes armed with ordnance such as rockets or cluster bombs. Alternatively they may be subject to artillery bombardment. In any case, enemy ground troops may attack stranded vehicles with additional ATGMs or RPGs.

In topography, a drainage divide, water divide, divide, ridgeline, watershed, water parting or height of land is elevated terrain that separates neighboring drainage basins. On rugged land, the divide lies along topographical ridges, and may be in the form of a single range of hills or mountains, known as a dividing range. On flat terrain, especially where the ground is marshy, the divide may be harder to discern. A triple divide is a point, often a summit, where three drainage basins meet. A valley floor divide is a low drainage divide that runs across a valley, sometimes created by deposition or stream capture. Major divides separating rivers that drain to different seas or oceans are called continental divides. The term height of land is a phrase used in Canada and the United States to refer to the divide between two drainage basins. Height of land is frequently used in border descriptions, which are set according to the \\"doctrine of natural boundaries\\". In glaciated areas it often refers to a low point on a divide where it is possible to portage a canoe from one river system to another. Types A minor drainage divide south of Buckeye, Arizona. Both branches flow to the Gila River. Drainage divides can be divided into three types: *Continental divide in which waters on each side flow to different oceans, such as the Congo-Nile Divide. Every continent except Antarctica has one or more continental divides. *Major drainage divide in which waters on each side of the divide never meet but flow into the same ocean, such as the divide between the Yellow River basin and the Yangtze. Another, more subtle, example is the Schuylkill-Lehigh divide at Pisgah Mountain in Pennsylvania in which two minor creeks divide to flow and grow east and west respectively joining the Lehigh River and Delaware River or the Susquehanna River and Potomac River, with each tributary complex having separate outlets into the Atlantic. *Minor drainage divide in which waters part but eventually rejoin at a river confluence, such as the Mississippi River and the Missouri River drainage divides.  Valley-floor divides  A valley-floor divide occurs on the bottom of a valley and arises as a result of subsequent depositions, such as scree, in a valley through which a river originally flowed continuously.Leser, Hartmut, ed. (2005). W√∂rterbuch Allgemeine Geographie, 13th ed., dtv, Munich, p. 935. . Examples include the Kartitsch Saddle in the Gail valley in East Tyrol, which forms the watershed between the Drau and the Gail, and the divides in the Toblacher Feld between Innichen and Toblach in Italy, where the Drau empties into the Black Sea and the Rienz into the Adriatic. Settlements are often built on valley-floor divides in the Alps. Examples are Eben im Pongau, Kirchberg in Tirol and Waidring (In all of these, the village name indicates the pass and the watershed is even explicitly displayed in the coat of arms). Extremely low divides with heights of less than two metres are found on the North German Plain within the Urstromt√§ler, for example, between Havel and Finow in the Eberswalde Urstromtal. In marsh deltas such as the Okavango, the largest drainage area on earth, or in large lakes areas, such as the Finnish Lakeland, it is difficult to find a meaningful definition of a watershed. A bifurcation is where the watershed is effectively in a river bed, in a wetland, or underground. The largest watershed of this type is the bifurcation of the Orinoco in the north of South America, whose main stream empties into the Caribbean, but which also drains into the South Atlantic via the Casiquiare canal and Amazon River. Political boundaries Since ridgelines are sometimes easy to see and agree about, drainage divides may form natural borders defining political boundaries, as with the Royal Proclamation of 1763 in British North America which coincided with the ridgeline of the Appalachian Mountains forming the Eastern Continental Divide that separated settled colonial lands in the east from Indian Territory to the west.  Portages and canals  Drainage divides hinder waterway navigation. In pre-industrial times, water divides were crossed at portages. Later, canals connected adjoining drainage basins; a key problem in such canals is ensuring a sufficient water supply. Important examples are the Chicago Portage, connecting the Great Lakes and Mississippi by the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, and the Canal des Deux Mers in France, connecting the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The name is enshrined at the Height of Land Portage which joins the Great Lakes to the rivers of western Canada.

Although SIA is usually applied to planned interventions, the same techniques can be used to evaluate the social impact of unplanned events, for example disasters, demographic change and epidemics. Definition frame The origins of SIA largely derive from the environmental impact assessment (EIA) model, which first emerged in the 1970s in the U.S, as a way to assess the impacts on society of certain development schemes and projects before they go ahead - for example, new roads, industrial facilities, mines, dams, ports, airports, and other infrastructure projects. In the United States under the National Environmental Policy Act, social impact assessments are federally mandated and performed in conjunction with environmental impact assessments. SIA has been incorporated into the formal planning and approval processes in several countries, in order to categorize and assess how major developments may affect populations, groups, and settlements. Though the social impact assessment has long been considered subordinate to the environmental impact assessment, new models, such as the Environmental Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), take a more integrated approach where equal weight is given to both the social and environmental impact assessments.  Contents  Definitions for \\"social impact assessment\\" vary by different sectors and applications. According to the International Association for Impact Assessment, \\"Social impact assessment includes the processes of analyzing, monitoring and managing the intended and unintended social consequences, both positive and negative, of planned interventions (policies, programs, plans, projects) and any social change processes invoked by those interventions. Its primary purpose is to bring about a more sustainable and equitable biophysical and human environment.\\" SIAs originate from the 1970s and were originally used in Anglo-Saxon environments with indigenous peoples, like the United States, Canada and Australia. Use of SIA's, in general in combination with Environmental Impact Assessments (ESIA) has since then developed, and are legally required in many other countries, ranging from development countries like Sierra Leone and Chad, emerging markets like Chile and Philippines but also other OECD countries like Greenland and South Africa. Increased pressure on available land and increasingly educated and competent local communities can lead to high costs for public acceptance of complex projects with adverse risks and effects. SIAs are increasingly seen as an effective instrument to bring these costs down by determining views of affected communities on risks, effects and mitigation measures based on a sound socio-economic baseline study. The IFC Performance Standards are generally seen as the benchmark for ESIAs and insert this in an overarching Environmental and Social Risk Management System, which is based on proven risk management techniques. The IFC Performance Standard is used by multinational companies and commercial investors. Commercial banks have united themselves under the Equator Principles with over 90 members in 37 countries. SIA overlaps with monitoring and evaluation (M&E;). Evaluation is particularly important in the areas of: # public policy, # health and education initiatives, and # international development projects more generally, whether conducted by governments, international donors, or NGOs. In all these sectors, there is a case for conducting SIA and evaluations at different stages. The Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol is a sector specific method for checking the quality of environmental and social assessments and management plans. Non-experts and local people should participate in the design and implementation of proposed developments or programmes. For example, in the field of research projects, it can be identified what people using social media platforms say and share about the social impact of science. This can be achieved in the process of doing an SIA, through adopting a participatory and democratic research process. Some SIAs go further than this, to adopt an advocacy role. For example, several SIAs carried out in Queensland, Australia, have been conducted by consultants working for local Aboriginal communities who oppose new mining projects on ancestral land. A rigorous SIA report, showing real consequences of the projects and suggesting ways to mitigate these impacts, gives credibility and provides evidence to take these campaigns to the planning officers or to the courts.

On joining the European Union, Maltese became one of the recognised languages of the EU - no mean achievement for a language spoken by less than half a million people. Initially it was known as L-Gƒßaqda tal- Kittieba tal-Malti (Association of Writers of Maltese), Malta's oldest literary society whose earliest activities go as far back as the early nineteen twenties, led by literary giants like Dun Karm, ƒ†u≈º√® Muscat Azzopardi and Ninu Cremona, it spearheaded the cause of the Maltese language. The Akkademja was mainly responsible for all the major linguistic and literary development of the Maltese language during the past century, developing linguistic academic initiatives which culminated in the national recognition of a standard written Maltese. In 2005 the National Council for the Maltese Language was set up through a Law by the Maltese Parliament. This Council is nowadays the main regulatory body of the Maltese language instead of the L-Akkademja tal-Malti.

H. Lawrence.  Biography  Mollie Skinner was born on 19 September 1876 to a Western Australian family that had established itself during the early years of settlement, distinguishing her position an \\"ancient colonist\\" in the local society from the \\"t'othersiders\\" who arrived in Western Australia from the eastern states. The family's religion was the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). Her mother was Jessie Rose Ellen, the daughter of George Walpole Leake, who had married James Tierney Skinner, a captain in the 18th Royal Irish Regiment. While born in Perth, her family took the infant Mollie to England and Ireland. She began her education in Edinburgh, but a painful condition of the eyes inflicted shortly afterward was treated by placing her in a darkened room for five years. The successful restoration of her health allowed her to begin composing poetry and stories and other tasks, and Skinner later enrolled at two children's hospitals in London to begin a career in nursing. Skinner returned to Perth with the rest of her family in 1900. She operated a convalescent home and guest house with a friend Nellie Beakbane, located in the foothills suburb of Darlington. On the recommendation of a friend, Pussy Jenkins, D H Lawrence and his wife stayed at this house while visiting Western Australia; their meeting would be influential to their respective literary careers. Mollie Skinner died on 25 May 1955 at the town of York. Works  Before leaving England in 1900 she was published in the Daily Mail newspaper. She wrote a memoir describing her experiences during the First World War, as a volunteer aid worker in Burma. Mollie was the co-owner of a guesthouse in Darlington, where D. H. Lawrence stayed, shortly after arriving in the country in 1922. Skinner's Letters of a V. A. D. was given to Lawrence by Margaret Cohen, another friend residing at the house, he became interested in her other works. After Lawrence read the work he remarked, \\"You have been given the Divine Spark and would bury it in a napkin\\". Her draft novel The House of Ellis was rewritten by Lawrence and published as The Boy in the Bush in August 1924. Her brother Jack was the subject of Lawrence's novel Kangaroo. Two years after the issue of her work with Lawrence, she met with Edward Garnett to discuss publication of Black Swans. His critique of the work as \\"so damn, damn bad ‚Ä¶\\" was interpreted by Skinner's tears and cries, before he finished by declaring it was also so \\"damn, damn good\\" that he intended to publish the work. Skinner's autobiography, The Fifth Sparrow, was edited by Mary Durack and Marjorie Rees while Skinner's health was failing and published posthumously in 1972. =Publications= * Midwifery Made Easy.

Moran was one of the finest strikers that Southampton has possessed. He had a knack of scoring some crucial goals for the club and had a fine understanding with midfielders Steve Williams and David Armstrong. Moran attended Prices School in Fareham and appeared regularly for his school team, where he was spotted by scouts. He signed for Southampton in August 1979 and made his debut as a substitute in a 4‚Äì1 home win against Manchester City in January 1980, scoring with his very first touch of the ball. In the 1980‚Äì81 season, Moran scored 18 goals in 30 starts in the league, and in 1982 he was voted PFA Young Player of the Year. Among the 99 goals that Moran scored for the Saints were a hat-trick in an 8‚Äì2 victory over Coventry City at The Dell in April 1984, during the club's most successful ever league season, when they finished as runners-up to Liverpool.1983‚Äì84 in English football In the same year, Moran scored an injury-time winner in the 4th Round of the FA Cup, away to arch rivals Portsmouth. David Armstrong crossed from the right and Moran arrived at the back post to volley left-footed past the Pompey 'keeper Alan Knight. Moran made 228 senior appearances for Southampton, including playing for them in the UEFA Cup. He was also capped twice for the England under-21 team. But he suffered from a recurring back injury and despite the promise of his early career, never represented England at senior level. In 1986‚Äì87 he joined Leicester City for a transfer fee of ¬£300,000, although at the end of the season they were relegated to Football League Division Two. During the following season he moved to Reading and he went on to make 144 senior appearances for them. For the 1991‚Äì92 season he moved on to Exeter City and after 74 senior appearances he transferred to Hull City for 1993‚Äì94. Post- football career Since retiring from football, Moran has worked for an internet company and as a lorry driver, currently working for David Watson Transport Ltd, based in Yorkshire.

Club career During the 1980s, Shaw's goals helped Aston Villa win the First Division championship in 1980‚Äì81 and the European Cup the following year - the only Birmingham-born player in the team. In 1981, he was voted PFA Young Player of the Year, and was awarded the Bravo Award the following year, as the best under-23 player in European Competitions. His promising Villa career was effectively ended after sustaining a knee injury in an away game at Nottingham Forest in September 1983. After a heavy tackle, he was helped to his feet by Ian Bowyer and, in Shaw's words, something in his knee 'clicked'. After his recovery, he continued to play for Villa until the conclusion of the 1987‚Äì88 season. In July 1988 he made his debut for Copenhagen-based Kj√∏benhavns Boldklub in Denmark, moving to SK Austria Klagenfurt in Austria in 1989. He finished his career off at Walsall, Kilmarnock, Shrewsbury Town and the Hong Kong-based Ernest Borel FC. International career Shaw gained seven caps for the England under-21 team. Following a successful European Cup campaign with Aston Villa, he was also included in the 40-strong preliminary England squad for the 1982 FIFA World Cup finals; however, he was not picked in the final 22.

Bowen was educated at Cardigan County School, University College, Aberystwyth, St John's College, Cambridge, Brussels and the Inns of Court. He served in the Army for five years during World War II, reaching the rank of Captain. He was a barrister and became a King's Counsel (KC) in 1952. At the 1945 general election, Bowen was elected at the first attempt as Member of Parliament for Cardiganshire, succeeding Owen Evans. With only a Labour opponent he comfortably held the seat. He was re-elected in the 1950 general election with the largest Liberal majority at that election, despite facing both Conservative and Labour opposition. During most of the 1950s he was one of a tiny group of only five or six Liberal MPs left at Westminster. He failed to succeed Clement Davies as leader of the Liberal Party in 1956 when Jo Grimond was chosen. His seat remained safe until the 1964 election when Labour cut his majority to around 2,000. At the 1966 general election, he was defeated by the Labour candidate by just 523 votes. Bowen's political career came second to his judicial career although he was a President of the Welsh Liberal Federation and member of its council. He was Recorder of Merthyr Tydfil and of Carmarthen. After the 1964 election when Labour's majority in the House of Commons was just four seats, he was persuaded by the Government to accept the position of Deputy Speaker. This put the Labour majority in the House up to five. Politically, he was on the right of the Liberal Party. During the Suez Crisis, he defended the Conservative Government against opposition \\"carping criticisms\\". One of the chief opposition critics of the Government over Suez was his own party leader, Jo Grimond. He served as National Insurance Commissioner for Wales, 1967‚Äì86, and as president of St Davids University College, Lampeter, 1977‚Äì92. One of the libraries and a research centre at Lampeter carry his name and Roderick Bowen is also the name of one of the student halls of residence. In 1971-72 he chaired a governmental committee set up to examine road signs policy in Wales.

Called the Bradford Spur motorway, the M606 leaves the M62 motorway at junction 26, near Cleckheaton, and heads into Bradford, to join the A6177 Bradford Ring Road. It is officially named the \\"Bradford South Radial Motorway\\" and was opened in 1973. Configuration of the terminal junctions =Staygate= The northern end of the M606, closest to the city, was built with a large raised roundabout crossing the Bradford Ring Road, but the original plans to continue the motorway under the roundaboutCBRD Histories: M606 were not carried out: access was only by slip roads to and from the roundabout. In 1999 a new slip road was built that allowed eastward traffic on the ring road, via a mini-roundabout, to enter the motorway directly and avoid the Staygate roundabout. In 2004 the junction was further remodelled, so that traffic leaving the motorway and wishing to turn eastward on the ring road continues under the roundabout, and round to join the roundabout from the opposite site, so that it has a left rather than a right turn to make (via two sets of traffic lights). Staygate roundabout is very close to Odsal Stadium, the home of the rugby league club Bradford Bulls. =Chain Bar= Chain Bar roundabout. Chain Bar Roundabout from above. The southerly junction with the M62 is known as the Chain Bar Interchange and features free-flowing sliproads from the Manchester direction M62 traffic to Bradford, but not the Leeds direction, which has to use the complexed traffic-light controlled roundabout.

Most of the embrithopod genera are known exclusively from jaws and teeth dated from the late Paleocene to the late Eocene; however, the order is best known from its terminal member, the elephantine Arsinoitherium. Description While embrithopods bore a superficial resemblance to rhinoceroses, their horns had bony cores covered in keratinized skin and were not made of hair. Not all embrithopods possessed horns, either. Despite their appearance, they have been regarded as related to elephants, not perissodactyls. As tethytheres,. Retrieved March 2013. the Embrithopoda have been believed to be part of the clade Afrotheria. However, a study of the basal arsinoitheriid, Palaeoamasia, suggests that embrithopods are not tethytheres or even paenungulates, and that they need to be better sampled in an analysis of eutherian relationships to clarify if they are even afrotherians.[Erdal et al.'s inclusion of Embrithopoda in Tabuce et al. (2007) finds them outside of (Ungulata + Afrotheria). Since this clade is not supported by molecular data, it suggests the need to explore the relationships of embrithopods, as they could potentially have affinities with laurasiatheres and \\"true\\" ungulates.] It is also not clear if embrithopods originated in Africa or Eurasia. However, recent findings demonstrate an African origin for embrithopods and furthermore a relationship with other paenungulates, albeit having diverged earlier than previously thought.E.

The group called themselves Level Seven after the seventh level of hell, the violent. Contained in some of the group‚Äôs web defacements, was the quote: \\"il livello sette posidare la vostra famiglia\\", which loosely translated from Italian says, \\"Level Seven owns your family\\". The group, spent most of their time on IRC - in the EFnet channel #LevelSeven discussing security, or the lack thereof. The group was also associated with other high- profile hacking groups such as Global Hell and Hacking For Girliez. Notability The hacking group was noted in Attrition's Top 20 most active groups of all time by claiming responsibility for over 60 unauthorized penetrations of computer systems in 1999 alone, including The First American National Bank, The Federal Geographic Data Committee, NASA and Sheraton Hotels. Level Seven is also credited with being the first group to hack a .ma domain and server located in Morocco. The server was owned by the Facult√© des Sciences Semlalia, Marrakech However, the group is most widely known for the September 7, 1999 defacement of (The US Embassy in China's Website), in regards to the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings. Level Seven typify a group of hackers who exploit or attack computers and networks for more than just the thrill and challenge, and for reasons other than money. During their era, they were activists, and they used their computer skills to make political statements and protest actions by government and industry. Thus, they bridged the realms of hacking and activism, operating in a domain that is now called \\"hacktivism\\".

This can happen for several reasons, including: *Tectonic earth movements, where the slope of the land changes, and the stream is tipped out of its former course *Natural damming, such as by a landslide or ice sheet *Erosion, either **Headward erosion of one stream valley upwards into another, or **Lateral erosion of a meander through the higher ground dividing the adjacent streams. **Within an area of karst topography, where streams may sink, or flow underground (a sinking or losing stream) and then reappear in a nearby stream valley *Glacier retreat The Maumee River basin. The Maumee, flowing north- east, has broken into part of the Wabash River basin, capturing west-flowing streams and reversing their flow direction on entering it. The additional water flowing down the capturing stream may accelerate erosion and encourage the development of a canyon (gorge). The now-dry valley of the original stream is known as a wind gap. Capture mechanisms =Tectonic uplift= *Barmah Choke: About 25,000 years ago, an uplift of the plains near Moama first dammed the Murray River and then forced it to take a new course. The new course dug its way through the so-called Barmah Choke and captured the lower course of the Goulburn River for . *Barrier Range: The original course of the Murray River was to a mouth near Port Pirie where a large delta is still visible protruding into the calm waters of Spencer Gulf. An uplift of the land blocked the river near the southern end of the Flinders Ranges, and the river eventually found its way to a new mouth near Lake Alexandrina. * Indus-Sutlej- Sarasvati-Yamuna: The Yamuna earlier flowed into the Ghaggar-Hakra River (identified with the Sarasvati River) and later changed its course due to plate tectonics. The Sutlej River flowed into the current channel of the Ghaggar-Hakra River until the 13th century after which it was captured by the Indus River due to plate tectonics.K.N. Dikshit, 2013, Origin of Early Harappan Cultures in the Sarasvati. Valley: Recent Archaeological Evidence and Radiometric Dates, Journal of Indian Ocean Archaeology, pp88- =Glacial damming= The River Thames as it passes through the Goring Gap *The River Thames in southern England originally entered the North Sea near Ipswich. About 450,000 years ago, an ice sheet expanding from the north pushed the course of the river southwards, forcing the Thames to cut a new mouth where the mouth of the River Blackwater, Essex now is, north of London. It later moved southwards again to its current position as a result of cutting through the Chiltern Hills at Goring-on-Thames, an event which created the Goring Gap. =Headward erosion= *The Teays River, captured by the Ohio River. *The Rio Grande which before capture flowed into a closed basin, Lake Cabeza de Vaca, but after capture flowed into the Gulf of Mexico. *The ancestral Niger River captured what is now the upper reaches of the Niger which once flowed into an endorheic basin to the east northeast of Timbuktu. *The River Stour, Kent, largely captured by the River Beult , River Teise and others. *The River Wey, in southern England, the western arm of which is the former upper waters of the River Blackwater (River Loddon). *The River Rheidol in Wales which has captured the headwaters of other streams and now runs for part of its length in a deep gorge. *The River Lyd in Devon, England. *The Black River, in Kings County, Nova Scotia, Canada, captured by the Gaspereau River *The Casiquiare canal is a distributary of the Orinoco River that is currently in the process of capturing the upper reaches of the latter river . =Karst= *The Donauversickerung (Danube Sink), currently developing in Germany, where a large portion of the upper part of the Danube river sinks into the limestone bedrock, and resurfaces in the Aachtopf spring, a tributary of the River Rhine. =Glacier retreat= The Slims River was previously fed by meltwater from the Kaskawulsh Glacier in the St. Elias Mountains in the Yukon and its waters flowed into Kluane Lake and on to the Bering Sea. Because of climate change, the glacier has rapidly receded and the meltwater no longer feeds the Slims. The water instead now feeds the Kaskawulsh River which is a tributary to the Alsek River and drains into the Gulf of Alaska.Retreating Yukon glacier makes river disappear, CBC News Posted: Jun 17, 2016 Effect on freshwater life River capture is a shaping force in the biogeography or distribution of many freshwater fish species.Albert, J. S., & Crampton, W. G. (2010). The geography and ecology of diversification in Neotropical freshwaters. Nature Education Knowledge, 1, 13-19Albert, J. S., Schoolmaster, D. R., Tagliacollo, V., & Duke-Sylvester, S. M. (2016). Barrier displacement on a neutral landscape: Towards a theory of continental biogeography. Systematic Biology, syw080 =Australian freshwater fish= The formerly massive Great Dividing Range runs the length of the eastern coastline of Australia and has isolated native freshwater fish populations east and west of the range for millions of years. In the last two million years erosion has reduced the Great Dividing Range to a critical point where west-to-east river capture events have been possible. A number of native fish species that originated in the Murray‚ÄìDarling river system to the west are (or were) found naturally occurring in a number of coastal systems spanning almost the entire length of the range. None of the river capture events that allowed native fish of the Murray-Darling system to cross into and colonise these East Coast river systems seem to have formed permanent linkages. The colonising Murray-Darling fish in these East Coast river systems have therefore become isolated from their parent species, and due to isolation, the founder effect, genetic drift and natural selection, have become separate species (see allopatric speciation). Examples include: * Golden perch (Dawson‚ÄìFitzroy river system, central Queensland). * Eel-tailed catfish (several rivers, northern New South Wales). However, note recent genetic research which now indicates eel-tailed catfish colonised east coast drainages in multiple colonisation events relatively recently (by evolutionary standards) and may subsequently have colonised the Murray‚ÄìDarling system via an east-to-west river capture event, contrary to usual west-to-east capture events listed here. * Macquarie perch (Hawkesbury-Nepean rivers, Shoalhaven River, southern New South Wales). * River blackfish (multiple rivers, Victoria). * Murray cod, whose eastern species/subspecies are: ** Eastern freshwater cod (Clarence River system, northern New South Wales. It was also found in the Richmond River system in New South Wales but that population is now extinct.) ** Brisbane River cod (Brisbane River system, southern Queensland. That population is now extinct, and its exact taxonomic status is not known.) ** The Mary River cod (Mary River, southern/central Queensland.) * The mountain galaxias species complex (multiple rivers, southern Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria). Olive perchlet (Ambassis agassizii), western carp gudgeon (Hypseleotris klungzingeri), pygmy perch (Nannoperca australis) and Australian smelt (Retropinna semoni) also appear to have made crossings into coastal systems, the last two species seemingly many times as they are found in most or all coastal streams in south eastern Australia as well as the Murray-Darling system. Unfortunately, with the exception of eastern freshwater cod and Mary River cod, it has not been widely recognised that these coastal populations of Murray‚ÄìDarling native fish are separate species and their classifications have not been updated to reflect this. Many are threatened and two, the Richmond River cod and the Brisbane River cod, have become extinct.

A General in the British Army, he also held political office as Master of the Buckhounds between 1841 and 1846 and again in 1852 and as Under-Secretary of State for War in 1859. Early life Rosslyn was the son of James St Clair-Erskine, 2nd Earl of Rosslyn, by his wife Harriet Elizabeth Bouverie, daughter of the Hon. Edward Bouverie (the second son of Jacob Bouverie, 1st Viscount Folkestone). Career Rosslyn entered the British Army in 1819. He purchased a captaincy in the 9th Light Dragoons in 1823 and a lieutenant-colonelcy in 1828. He was promoted to Major- General in 1854, to Lieutenant-General in 1859 and to full General on 20 April 1866. In 1864 he was appointed Regimental Colonel of the 7th Queen's Own Hussars after the death of General Sir William Tuyll. Lord Rosslyn also commanded the Auxiliary Cavalry Regiment, The Fife Mounted Rifle Volunteers from 1860 until his death in 1866. =Political career= Rosslyn was returned to Parliament for Dysart Burghs, in Fife, in 1830, a seat he held until 1831, and then represented Grimsby from 1831 to 1832. He succeeded his father in the earldom in 1837. In 1841 he was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Master of the Buckhounds under Sir Robert Peel, which he remained until the government fell in 1846. He held the same office from February to December 1852 under Lord Derby, and was briefly Under-Secretary of State for War under Derby from March to June 1859. Lord Rosslyn was also a Deputy Lieutenant for Fife. Personal life In 1826, James married Frances Wemyss (1794‚Äì1858), daughter of Lt.-Gen. William Wemyss, of Wemyss Castle, Fife. Together, they were the parents of two sons and a daughter, including: * Hon. James Alexander George St Clair-Erskine (1830‚Äì1851), styled Lord Loughborough, a Lieut. who died unmarried. * Francis Robert St Clair-Erskine, 4th Earl of Rosslyn, who married Blanche Adeliza FitzRoy, great-granddaughter of Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton and widow of Col. Hon.

He came in at second place in the 1992 presidential election. In November 2007, he announced that he would stand as a presidential candidate in the December 2007 election.The Standard, 16 November 2007: Matiba set to contest presidency Matiba placed seventh, with 8,046 votes. Early career Matiba became a senior civil servant at age 31. Before Kenya attained its independence in December 1963, he became the first indigenous African Permanent Secretary for Education (in May of that year).Daily Nation, 13 April 2003: Matiba was mentored by Carey Francis, headmaster of Alliance High School, who lobbied for his promotion to permanent secretary. In 1964, Matiba was appointed Permanent Secretary for Commerce under Minister Mwai Kibaki. Matiba continued to succeed during the post- colonial period, helped by his connection to the Kiambu family of Musa Gitau, one of the first Africans to become a minister in the Kenyan Presbyterian Church (Matiba is Gitau's son-in-law). Gitau also influenced Jomo Kenyatta, having taught him at the PCEA Center, Thogoto, Kikuyu. In the patron-client reward system established by Kenyatta after independence, such connections were important to success in the public and private sectors. Matiba later left his civil-service career for one in the hospitality industry, establishing the Alliance Group of Hostels based on the South Coast. He also invested in exclusive private schools, including Hillcrest Preparatory (founded by Frank Thompson) and Hillcrest Secondary School. Matiba was chairman of the Kenya Football Federation from 1974 to 1978, and was elected to the Kenyan Parliament in the 1983 general elections from the Mbiri Constituency (later renamed Kiharu) in the Muranga District.Center for Multiparty Democracy: Politics and Parliamentarians in Kenya 1944‚Äì2007 He served as Minister of Transport and Communications under the KANU administration led by President Daniel arap Moi, resigning in December 1988. Political activism At Moi's behest, Matiba was held without trial at the Kamiti Maximum Security Prison in 1990 with Charles Rubia, a member of the Kenyan Cabinet who also called for multiparty democracy.Amnesty USA, 7 February 1991: Medical Concern: Kenneth Matiba While in prison Matiba was refused medication and suffered a stroke, which affected half his body and incapacitated him for some time. Later, a multiparty system was instituted and Matiba was released. He was part of the opposition alliance forming the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD). During the December 1992 election, Matiba was the candidate representing FORD- Asili, a party he helped found in splintering from the original FORD. President Moi won the election on the KANU ticket; Matiba placed second, winning the Kiharu Constituency parliamentary seat in the concurrent parliamentary elections. He boycotted the December 1997 election (citing a lack of democracy), burning his voter's card.The Standard, 26 November 2006:Anxiety over return of Kenneth Matiba Matiba has a long-standing rivalry with Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki. Before the December 2002 election Matiba was leader of the minor Saba Saba Asili party, which declined to join the NARC coalition;The Standard, 26 November 2006: Why former Kiharu MP will never forgive Kibaki however, he did not run for the presidency or a parliamentary seat. In his later years, Matiba was dogged by ill-health stemming from his 1990 imprisonment. His business holdings also suffered, with his hotel chain being briefly taken into administration (although he regained control) and Hillcrest School sold by administrators (a case he legally contested). Matiba regained control of the school, which he later sold to a consortium led by Fanisi. He founded The People newspaper. It began as a weekly in 1992, becoming a daily in 1998; however, it was a drain on Matiba's finances.KENYA Press, Media, TV, Radio, Newspapers As of 2008, he remained chairman of Saba Saba Asili and re-registered as a voter.Daily Nation, 29 September 2007: Anxiety grips Murang'a as Matiba gets new voter's card Personal life In 2000 Matiba released his autobiography, Aiming High.

Hat Rin is the peninsula seen to the lower left. Hat Rin (, ) is a peninsular beach area and town on the southern tip of Ko Pha-ngan, an island in the Gulf of Thailand. Its two main beaches are Sunset Beach (Hat Rin Nai) to the south and the larger Sunrise Beach (Hat Rin Nok) to the north. A Full Moon Party takes place on Sunrise Beach each month. The town and beach first became popular for backpacker tourism to escape the tourist influx to Ko Samui in the 1980s. As the popularity of the beach and Full Moon Party have increased, the town has grown to accommodate the new visitors. The town is centred on Chicken Corner, a crossroads and popular meeting spot.  Entertainment  Sunrise Beach Most of the nightlife in the town is centred on beachfront spots. The original beach bars, Drop-In Bar and Cactus Bar attract the largest crowds, with nightly drinks promotions and fire shows. Here, popular chart tunes, R&B; and club classics entertain the crowds. Other beach bars include Vinyl Club, Zoom (both playing psytrance, the original Full Moon Party style of music), Orchid (playing Drum and Bass and Jungle) and Boom Boom Bar (playing deeper house and trance music). = Fire shows = Apart from the music and bars on the beaches of Hat Rin, a regular feature of the Hat Rin are the nightly fire shows put on by individuals at the Cactus and Drop-In Bars. Various individuals specialize in the arts of Poi and Staff, performing tricks to entertain the crowds. The firesticks are ropes twisted around sticks and soaked in diesel which, when burned, emits choking clouds of toxic stench. Many tourists are inspired by the shows and opt to take up daytime lessons before joining the evening fire shows. = Pollution = Hat Rin is polluted with litter, but given the constant parties, it is relatively clean. There are sewage works and the sewerage is not pumped into the sea. However, owing to the vast number of tourists frequently visiting the island to enjoy the Full Moon Party, the amount of trash is unbearable. The following day can be described as total carnage. Intoxicated travellers are sleeping off their hangover, whilst the beach is covered in plastic cups, bottles, and other plastic materials.  Popular culture  Hat Rin Beach has featured in many media such as the Danny Boyle film adaption of The Beach, The Backpacker by John Harris, and songs by The Klaxons and by S-Kay.

Sometimes a such function is referred as n-harmonic function, where n ‚â• 2 is the dimension of the complex domain where the function is defined.See for example and . calls such functions \\"fonctions biharmoniques\\", irrespective of the dimension n ‚â• 2 : his paper is perhaps the older one in which the pluriharmonic operator is expressed using the first order partial differential operators now called Wirtinger derivatives. However, in modern expositions of the theory of functions of several complex variablesSee for example the popular textbook by and the advanced (even if a little outdated) monograph by . it is preferred to give an equivalent formulation of the concept, by defining pluriharmonic function a complex valued function whose restriction to every complex line is a harmonic function with respect to the real and imaginary part of the complex line parameter. Formal definition . Let be a complex domain and be a (twice continuously differentiable) function. The function is called pluriharmonic if, for every complex line :{ a + b z \\\\mid z \\\\in {\\\\mathbb{C}} }\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{C}^n formed by using every couple of complex tuples , the function :z \\\\mapsto f(a + bz) is a harmonic function on the set :{ z \\\\in {\\\\mathbb{C}} \\\\mid a + b z \\\\in G }\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{C}.

He is best remembered as a scientific advisor to the Allies on bombing strategy in the Second World War, for his work to advance the cause of nuclear non- proliferation, and for his role in bringing attention to global economic issues. King, Steve \\"From boffin to baron\\" , The Spectator (9 June 2001) Early life and education Solomon Zuckerman was born in Cape Town in the British Cape Colony (modern-day South Africa) on 30 May 1904, the second child and eldest son of Moses and Rebecca Zuckerman (n√©e Glaser). Both his parents were the children of Jewish immigrants from Russia.Archives Hub He was educated at the South African College School. After studying medicine at the University of Cape Town and later attending Yale University, he went to London in 1926 to complete his studies at University College Hospital Medical School. He began his career at the London Zoological Society in 1928, and worked as a research anatomist until 1932. It was in this period he founded the intellectual dining club, Tots and Quots. In 1932, Zuckerman published his most noteworthy pre-war work, Social Life of Monkeys and Apes. He taught at the University of Oxford from 1934 to 1945, during which time he was elected to a Fellowship of the Royal Society. Second World War During the Second World War, Zuckerman worked on several research projects for the British Government, including the design of a civilian defence helmet (colloquially known as the Zuckerman helmet) and measuring the effect of bombing on people and buildings and an assessment of the bombardment (Operation Corkscrew) of the Italian island of Pantelleria in 1943. He was thus one of the pioneers of the science of operational research. He was given an honorary commission as a wing commander in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch of the Royal Air Force on 13 May 1943, and promoted to honorary group captain on 20 September 1943. Zuckerman's suggestion, made when he was Scientific Director of the British Bombing Survey Unit (BBSU),Zuckerman Archive: British Bombing Survey Unit; Reference and contact details: GB 1187 SZ/BBSU and accepted by Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder and Supreme Allied Commander U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower in the lead-up to the Normandy landings, that the Allies concentrate on disrupting the German-controlled French transportation system through heavy aerial bombing of rail lines and marshalling yards, was officially called the Transportation Plan,McArthur, Charles W. Operations analysis in the U.S. Army Eighth Air Force in World War II, Part 790, American Mathematical Society/London Mathematical Society (1990) but was privately referred to by its opponents as \\"Zuckerman's Folly\\". A focus of Zuckerman's plan, learned in Italy, was to target locomotives and the capacity to service them due to a shortage in France prior to the Normandy campaign. This had the effect of pushing rail heads back from the front causing trucks to be diverted from a role of manoeuvre to one of logistics, which resulted in greater petrol consumption. Chapter 9, Transportation Campaigns Later career The Zuckerman helmet, designed for civil defence units After the war, Zuckerman was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1946 New Year Honours. He left the Royal Air Force on 1 September 1946, and was then Professor of Anatomy at the University of Birmingham until 1968, chief scientific adviser to the Ministry of Defence from 1960 to 1966, and chief scientific adviser to the British Government from 1964 to 1971. He was also a member of a Royal Commission investigating environmental pollution from 26 February 1970. In 1951 Zuckerman published his paper summarizing the existing data both for and against the possibility of postnatal oogenesis.1951 publication of Zuckerman's theory on postnatal oogenesis He taught at the University of East Anglia from 1969 to 1974, where he was involved in setting up a school of environmental sciences. He served as Secretary of the London Zoological Society from 1955 to 1977 and as its President from 1977 to 1984. Some of Zuckerman's achievements include being a pioneer in the study of primate behaviour. He is also credited for making science a normal part of government policy in the Western world. His more notable publications include The Social Life of Monkeys and Apes published in 1931, and Scientists and War in 1966. Zuckerman wrote two volumes of autobiography: From Apes to Warlords and Monkeys Men and Missiles. Awards and honours Zuckerman was knighted in the 1956 New Year Honours, promoted Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1964 New Year Honours, appointed to the Order of Merit on 23 April 1968, and was awarded a life peerage on 5 April 1971, taking the title Baron Zuckerman of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1943. Family life He met his future wife, Lady Joan Rufus Isaacs, daughter of Gerald Isaacs, 2nd Marquess of Reading, in Oxford. They married in 1939 and had two children, a son, Paul, and a daughter, Stella. Stella Zuckerman died in 1992, predeceasing her parents. Joan, Lady Zuckerman died in 2000.

The name is derived from a prominent stretch of Eucalyptus salmonophloia (Salmon Gum) trees which formed a landmark in the town's early days. The town is part of the Shire of Esperance. At the 2016 census, Salmon Gums had a population of 191. The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling. History The first potential use of a townsite was as a watering spot for the proposed Esperance to Norseman Railway, since Salmon Gums is roughly halfway between these two towns. Land for a town-site was set aside in 1912 and the name was recommended in 1916. This land lay within the tribal boundaries of the indigenous Kalaako. The town was gazetted in 1925, when the Esperance to Salmon Gums section of the railway was completed.Western Australian Government Gazette, file 5335/12, 4 February 1925, p.157. Settlement of the area received a boost after the First World War when returning soldiers were given grants of land in this and many other areas around the state. These grantees became known as soldier settlers. At the time Salmon Gums was regarded as being on the fringe of arable land. The low soil fertility and marginal average rainfall of 341mm meant that yields were poor prior to the 1950s. As a result, the land was not in high demand, so the opportunity cost to the government was quite small. Agricultural research was boosted prior to the Second World War by the establishment of the Salmon Gums Research Station. In 1949 a similar station, the Esperance Downs Research Station was established near Esperance. Research at the latter quickly led to the discovery that soil in the Esperance region was deficient in trace elements, reportedly phosphorus, copper and zinc, and the addition of these greatly improved fertility and crop yields. Since then the region, including Salmon Gums, has become a successful producer of wheat, sheep and cattle. Mining In 2001 a Perth-based iron ore company announced an investigation into a large lignite deposit at Salmon Gums for use reducing its phosphorus- rich iron ore currently being mined at Koolyanobbing. As of 2009 all plans for the mining of the lignite has been suspended indefinitely due to the stock market collapse in early 2009. The sudden drop in oil prices would make the refinement of the oil suspended in the lignite financially unviable.

He is considered the founder of the Rajasa dynasty of the Singhasari and Majapahit line of monarchs. He came from humble origins but subsequently rose to be the most powerful ruler in Java. His life was coloured with adventures, treacheries, and tragedies. Early life According to the Pararaton, a semi-mythical literary work on the kings of Java, Ken Arok was born to a poor peasant family on the bank of the Brantas River in East Java. His mother Ken Endok, was the wife of a Brahmin Gajahpura in the kingdom of Kediri. The infant Ken Arok was placed in the Brantas by his parents who hoped he would be found by a wealthier family and get a better life. However, the baby Ken Arok was found by a thief called Lembong. His foster father taught him all his criminal skills and young Ken Arok grew to be the most cunning thief in Kediri. Doing much mischief and crimes, he was known all the way to the capital. Many people were sent to catch him, but none were successful. One day Ken Arok met with Mpu Lohgawe, an Indian rishi who patiently taught Ken Arok to abandon his sinful life and start a new life. Lohgawe proclaimed Arok as an avatar of Vishnu. His effort was successful and later he managed to get Ken Arok to become an attendant of Tunggul Ametung, a powerful regional leader of the Tumapel area. By chance Ken Arok accidentally saw Ken Dedes, a beautiful wife of Tunggul Ametung, when she was taking a bath. Legend says when the wind blew over her dress and revealed her legs, Ken Arok said that he saw a beautiful light shining. He later told this to his teacher, who stated that it was a sign that Ken Dedes would bear a royal dynasty and any man that took her as wife would be a King. Ken Arok, already infatuated by her beauty, became even more eager to take her by any means ‚Äîincluding killing Tunggul Ametung if necessary. By this time, Ken Arok had actually had a wife, a woman named Ken Umang from his village, and left her pregnant. . Kris of Mpu Gandring Tunggul Ametung however was a very powerful man and held an important position. Thus, Ken Arok needed an exceptionally strong weapon to defeat him, and also had to find a way to do so without himself being punished for the crime. He managed to get this by ordering a kris from a famous smith called Mpu Gandring. However the kris casting took a very long time. After several months, an impatient Ken Arok visited Mpu Gandring to check on the kris's progress. He saw that the kris had already taken shape and was strong enough to be called an exceptional weapon. However, Mpu Gandring stated that he still needed several months to perform rituals to imbue the kris with more magical power, not only to make it strong but also to prevent it from becoming an evil weapon. Ken Arok became furious on hearing this. Knowing that Ken Dedes was pregnant, and determined to murder Tunggul Ametung before his wife gave birth to a possible son and heir, Ken Arok took the kris from its maker and stabbed Mpu Gandring. With his last breath, Mpu Gandring famously cursed Ken Arok, foretelling that he himself and seven generations of his descendants would be killed by that cursed kris. Now owning an exceptional weapon, Ken Arok got ready for the next step of his plan. He gave the kris to Kebo Ijo, another attendant of Tunggul Ametung, a greedy man known to be fond of collecting krises. As Ken Arok expected, Kebo Ijo showed his new kris to every man he met. The kris was not only strong but also had a unique pattern that made it easily recognized. It wasn't long when almost everyone in Tumapel knew about the kris. One night, Ken Arok stole the kris back from Kebo Ijo while he was asleep. He then secretly went to Tunggul Ametung's room and stabbed him to death, and left the kris at the scene. In the morning, everyone in Tumapel was shocked to hear of Tunggul Ametung's death. When they found the kris, they accused Kebo Ijo of being the assassin, just as Ken Arok had planned. Before Kebo Ijo was able to defend himself, Ken Arok stabbed him to death, on the pretext of revenging Tunggul Ametung. And so Ken Arok was able to kill Tunggul Ametung, take Ken Dedes to be his wife, and proclaim himself the new ruler of Tumapel. The ambition of Ken Arok did not stop in Tumapel. In 1222, at the battle of Ganter, he defeated king Kertajaya of Kediri and founded the new kingdom of Singasari. Kediri became a fief under the kingdom of Singasari. Rule and his death Ken Arok thus founded a new kingdom and started a new dynasty. He took the title Sri Ranggah Rajasa Bhatara Amurwabhumi (The rainbow king of universe and all lands), and his dynasty was called the Rajasa Dynasty. His new kingdom was centered in Singasari (now in Malang municipality), about 50 kilometres east of Kediri. To legitimate his ascension, he claimed to be a son of Siwa. Ken Arok's rule however was short. Anusapati, son of Ken Dedes and Tunggul Ametung and thus Ken Arok's stepson, had suspected for a long time that Ken Arok was responsible for his father's death. One day, after finding out the truth, he went after and killed Ken Arok. Legend says that Anusapati used the kris of Mpu Gandring to kill Ken Arok; the same kris that Ken Arok used to kill Tunggul Ametung and thus fulfilling the beginning of Empu Gandring's curse. In the end, Anusapati was also killed by his stepbrother, Panji Tohjaya with the same kris. Descendants The kings of Majapahit were believed to be descended from Ken Arok, as also were the Mataram rulers. Ki/Kyai Ageng Pemanahan, the founder of Mataram, claimed himself to inherit the royal blood of Majapahit. This makes all subsequent Mataram kings descendants of Ken Arok who is also believed to be the ancestor of the new Mataram Empire founded in the 17th century which split into two in 1755 to become the kingdoms of present-day Surakarta, and Ngayogyakarta hadiningrat (The Sultanate of Jogjakarta or Jogja), thus making Ken Arok and Ken Dedes the ancestors of all Javanese monarchs. In popular culture The story of Ken Arok has been enduringly popular Central and East Java. He has been the subject of several books, movies, and traditional Javanese theater (ketoprak).

Early life Putt was born in Sydney and attended school at Hornsby High School. At the age of 16, she won a scholarship to the Australian International Independent School in Epping. At this time, Putt was also part of organising High School Students against Vietnam. She then travelled to the United Kingdom where she studied a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in international relations, at the University of Sussex, graduating with Honours. After completing her degree, Putt travelled back to Australia through Asia, and in 1975 got a job developing pollution control programs at Botany, at a time when the NSW Environment Protection Agency had just been set up. In the late 1970s Putt moved up to Nimbin, and camped at a commune. She later moved to the Northern Territory to work with Aboriginal communities on Elcho Island in Arnhem land. She then moved to live on Dangar Island in the Hawkesbury, NSW. She moved to Tasmania in 1986 with her partner and two daughters, where she became spokesperson for the Huon Protection Group which succeeded in stopping development of a new woodchip mill on the Huon River. She also founded the Tasmanian Threatened Species Network and was director of the Tasmanian Conservation Trust.Sue Neales, \\"Living the Green dream\\", The Mercury, 11 March 2006 Political career In 1992, Bob Brown asked Peg to be a support candidate for the Green Independents at the impending state election after the first Labor-Green accord collapsed. Putt entered the Tasmanian House of Assembly in 1993 after Bob Brown resigned and votes in the Hobart electorate of Denison were recounted. The 1996 state election gave the Greens the balance of power and Putt was one of four Greens to be in parliament during the period of balance of power. In 1998 the Labor and Liberal parties restructured the Tasmanian Parliament, reducing the number of House of Assembly members from 35 to 25. In the 1998 state election, called one week after the restructure, she was the only one out of four Greens to retain a seat and became leader as a result. Four years later in the 2002 election she recorded the second highest vote of 12,036 (20.0%) after Tasmanian premier Jim Bacon and became one of four Greens elected. In doing so, she outpolled the leader of the Liberal Party, Bob Cheek, in their electorate of Denison. Putt became the Greens parliamentary leader. Putt was re-elected in the 2006 election, receiving 18.4% of first preferences, a decrease compared to her previous result, but the highest of any Denison candidate. On 7 July 2008, Putt announced her retirement as leader of the Tasmanian Greens, and as a Member of the House of Assembly.Tas Greens leader Putt quits politics, The Age, 7 July 2008. She was replaced as Greens leader by the party's deputy leader, Nick McKim. After politics After her resignation, Putt left the state and has since returned to focus on international work, representing the Wilderness Society at UN climate change and forest negotiations. In 2012, Putt was appointed CEO of anti-logging group Markets for Change and has since publicly criticised the Wilderness Society. In 2011, Putt was placed on the Tasmanian Honour Roll of Women for her environmental advocacy.

He sat in the House of Commons from 1939 to 1950.  Early life  Horabin was born in Merthyr Tydfil and educated at Cardiff High School, and during the First World War he served from 1914 to 1918 with the Cameron Highlanders. After the war he went into business, and became chairman of Lacrinoid Ltd, which made buttons and other synthetic products. Later he worked as a business consultant, and worked with a company formed in 1948 to develop trade with Yugoslavia.  Political career  Following the death of Liberal Member of Parliament (MP), Sir Francis Acland in 1939, Horabin was selected by North Cornwall Liberals to defend the marginal seat at the resulting by-election. Along with his party leader, Sir Archibald Sinclair, he was a vocal opponent of Chamberlain's Nazi appeasement policy. This issue was central to the debate in the by-election, which he won with an increased majority of 1,464 in a straight fight with the Conservatives. He was also a strong advocate, along with Sir Stafford Cripps, of a Popular Front of left-of-centre parties coming together to defeat the Conservative led National government. He continued to hold the seat until 1950. In 1944 he authored Politics Made Plain. What the next general election will really be about, a book published by Penguin which urged voters to reject Churchill and the Conservatives at the general election. He was re-elected in 1945 and appointed Liberal Chief Whip by the new Liberal leader, Clement Davies. However, he became frustrated with some of the pro-Conservative sympathies of some of his colleagues. He resigned his post and his party's whip in 1946 to sit as an Independent. In January 1947, he was seriously injured when a BOAC aircraft in which he was a passenger crashed in Kent. He later sued BOAC for damages, and after hearings in the High Court, the case was settled in November 1952 when he accepted ¬£3,017 in damages. In November 1947 Horabin took the Labour whip. The North Cornwall Liberals wanted him to resign the seat and seek re-election, but he refused, saying that the principles for which he stood had been set out clearly in his address to voters at the general election. At the 1950 election, Labour invited him to defend North Cornwall as a Labour candidate, but he refused on the grounds that he would then be campaigning against people who had previously campaigned for him. A further factor was that his injuries in the crash had been severe, keeping him away from Parliament for a year, and a campaign in the scattered North Cornwall constituency might have been too great a strain. Instead he fought Exeter as the Labour candidate, but lost to the sitting Conservative MP John Cyril Maude. Horabin died in Folkestone on 26 April 1956, aged 60. Having married in 1920, he left a widow, two sons and a daughter.

Early life and career Andersson was born in Kungsholmen, Stockholm, the daughter of Karin (n√©e Mansion), a social worker, and Josef Andersson, a businessman. Her first collaboration with Ingmar Bergman came in 1951, when she participated in his production of an advertisement for the detergent Bris. She also worked as an extra on film sets as a teenager, and studied acting at the Terserus Drama School and at the Royal Dramatic Theatre School (1954‚Äì1956). She then joined the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm. In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, Andersson starred in ten motion pictures and three television films directed by Bergman. With Ingrid Thulin and Eva Dahlbeck, she shared the Best Actress Prize at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival for the director's Brink of Life, a film set in a maternity ward. The other films included The Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, The Magician, The Passion of Anna, The Touch, and Persona. In 1963, Andersson won the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the 13th Berlin International Film Festival for her performance in Vilgot Sj√∂man's The Mistress. From the mid-1960s onwards Andersson's intense portrayal of a nurse in the film Persona (1966) ‚Äì in which the actress Elizabet Vogler (Liv Ullmann), suffering from a psychosomatic condition, is mostly mute ‚Äì involved her delivering the majority of the dialogue. For her performance in Persona, she won the award for Best Actress at the 4th Guldbagge Awards. That year she was seen alongside James Garner and Sidney Poitier in the western Duel at Diablo. More Bergman collaborations followed, and she worked with John Huston (The Kremlin Letter, 1970) and Robert Altman (Quintet, 1979, with Paul Newman). She was actor Steve McQueen's co-star in his only credited film as a producer, a film of Arthur Miller's stage adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's An Enemy of the People (1977). Andersson made her debut in American theatre in 1973 with a production of Erich Maria Remarque's Full Circle. Her most famous American film is I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (1977), which also starred Kathleen Quinlan. In 1990, Andersson worked as a theatre director in Stockholm, directing several plays at Dramaten. In the late 1980s and early 1990s she worked primarily in television and as a theatre actress, working with Bergman and others. She was also a supervisor for the Road to Sarajevo, a humanitarian project. Personal life In 1996, Andersson published her autobiography, Ett √∂gonblick (A Moment, or, literally, A Blink of the Eye). She was married first to the director Kjell Grede (1960, divorced) with whom she had a daughter; and secondly to politician and writer Per Ahlmark (1978, divorced). Andersson then married Gabriel Mora Baeza on 29 May 2004. In 2009, she had a stroke; an article published the following year says that from that time on she had been hospitalized and was unable to speak. She was the younger sister of Swedish film actress Gerd Andersson. Andersson died on 14 April 2019, aged 83.

Early life Lord Rosslyn was the eldest son of Robert St Clair-Erskine, 4th Earl of Rosslyn and the former Blanche Adeliza (n√©e FitzRoy) Maynard (the widow of Col. the Hon.

In 1902, he lost ¬£310 while playing poker. In 1903, he was in Court for refusing to pay a $150 draft. In 1908, Rosslyn and Sir Hiram Maxim were in the news for a gambling duel in Monte Carlo to \\"break the bank\\".

Jonathan Hoefler (; born August 22, 1970) is an American typeface designer. Hoefler founded the Hoefler Type Foundry in 1989, a type foundry in New York.  Early life  Jonathan Hoefler was born on August 22, 1970, in New York City to Doreen Benjamin and Charles Hoefler, a theatrical set designer and producer. Growing up, it was the Gill Sans text on boxes of custard that drew him to typography design. He is largely self-taught, and worked with magazine art director Roger Black prior to forming the Hoefler Type Foundry in 1989.  Career  Hoefler's Champion Gothic was inspired by 19th century wood type. It was commissioned for Sports Illustrated shortly after founding the company in 1989. In 1997, his path crossed with type designer Tobias Frere-Jones when both were trying to purchase German type foundry catalogs. In 1999, Hoefler began working with Frere-Jones, and from 2005‚Äì2014 the company operated under the name Hoefler & Frere-Jones as a partnership.Hoefler & Frere-Jones#Conflict between Hoefler and Frere-Jones In 2000, the firm, under Frere-Jones' direction, designed its ubiquitous Gotham typeface for GQ magazine and received wide recognition for their work and in the last 20 years is one of the most successful typefaces. Hoefler's process when designing typefaces begins with research into historical records and then utilize the programming language Python to automate repetitive tasks. Their typefaces are systematic and logical and incorporate specific features based on their research. Hoefler has designed original typefaces for Rolling Stone, Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, The New York Times Magazine, Sports Illustrated, and Esquire and several institutional clients, including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and alternative band They Might Be Giants. Perhaps his best-known work is the Hoefler Text family of typefaces, designed for Apple Computer and now appearing as part of the Macintosh operating system. He also designed the current wordmark of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. In January 2014, Frere-Jones sued Hoefler for $20 million in the New York Supreme Court accusing him of scamming Frere-Jones. Frere-Jones claimed that in 1999, Hoefler agreed to a verbal 50-50 partnership that was legally binding. In light of the lawsuit, Hoefler changed the name back to Hoefler & Co claiming Frere-Jones had only been an employee, citing an agreement that they weren't partners but ‚Äúindependent entities\\" and asked the court to dismiss the case. Fans of the foundry were shocked by the news of the lawsuit. They later settled in September of 2014.  Awards and recognition  In 1995, Hoefler was named one of the forty most influential designers in America by I.D. magazine,‚ÄúThe I.D.

Due to his 2013 expedition recreating the voyage and mountain crossing of Sir Ernest Shackleton, Jarvis is considered an authority on Shackleton and the leadership style he espoused. Tim Jarvis is well-known public speaker who presents regularly around the world. He formerly worked as a Senior Associate - Sustainability to global engineering solutions firm Arup, and has also advised the World Bank, AusAID, and the Asian Development Bank on multilateral aid projects. His environmental work is mainly focused on climate change, sustainable aid provision in developing countries, and improving corporate environmental sustainability, as well as 'significant project' management through his project 25zero, which uses equatorial glacial melt as an indicator of global climate change, and the ForkTree Project, which aims to rewild an area of degraded farmland. Since 2019, Jarvis has lobbied to establish an East Antarctic Marine Protected Area together with Save Our Marine Life (an alliance of leading conservation organisations) and the Pew Charitable Trust. Jarvis authored the forward to the report 'The East Antarctic Marine Park: Maintaining Australia's Legacy', produced in 2019. Jarvis says he is \\"committed to finding pragmatic solutions to global environmental sustainability issues\\", and as a public speaker he talks regularly about motivation and leadership to both individuals and organisations.  Brand Associations  In August 2016, Jarvis became Sustainability Ambassador for the Steadfast Group - Australia's largest insurance brokerage network - with climate change being identified as a major issue for the insurance sector. In November 2016, global adventure-wear brand Kathmandu (company), announced Jarvis as their global brand ambassador. In April 2017 he was also made Global Brand Ambassador of Whyte and Mackay's Shackleton branded scotch whisky, which is a recreation of the century-old vintage discovered trapped in the ice basement of Shackleton's Hut at Cape Royds, Antarctica, by the Antarctic Heritage Trust. Since October 2017, Tim Jarvis has been Corporate Ambassador - Sustainability for the PICA Group of Companies. PICA is the largest apartment building manager (strata corporation manager) in Australia. Jarvis is committed to 'greening' the footprint of the industry.

In 2017, he was invited by Nissan to help promote the electric Leaf 2, filming in Bangkok for the Asian and Australian markets. Biography and awards Born in May 1966, Jarvis is best known for his numerous Antarctic expeditions, particularly the period recreations of historical treks by Sir Douglas Mawson and Sir Ernest Shackleton, as well as the his attempted Antarctic crossing in 1999, undertaken with fellow Australian explorer Peter Treseder. As a result of this expedition, he is the joint record holder for the fastest unsupported journey to the Geographic South Pole from the 'true' edge of Antarctica (where the ice of the continent meets the sea). He holds dual Australian/UK citizenships and spends his time primarily in Australia, with visits to the UK, the Americas, and Africa, for business and exploration- based activities and public engagements. He is the author of The Unforgiving Minute, which recounts his expeditions to the North and South Poles as well as the crossing of several Australian deserts. He is also involved in various philanthropic ventures including as a former (until 2019) Board Member of Zoos SA (comprising Adelaide Zoo and Monarto Safari Park), fundraising work with Helping Rhinos (a UK charity aiming to save rhinoceros species from extinction) as an Ambassador of the Australian Rhino Project, and his former role as councillor of the Australian Conservation Foundation. He is also contributing author of the coursebook Frozen Planet produced by Open University, a course linked with the BBC's Frozen Planet series that aired in 2011. Jarvis was recognised by the Australian Geographic Society, winning its \\"Spirit of Adventure\\" medal for his kayak journey across Lake Eyre, Australia's largest salt lake, in 2004. On 20 November 2014, Jarvis was announced as WWF-Australia Global Ambassador, and was made a Governor of WWF in 2019.

For his work on the 25zero project, Jarvis was awarded Conservationist of the Year in 2016 by the Australian Geographic Society. He received the Sydney Institute of Marine Science's Emerald award (their highest) in 2013 for services to the environment. In 2014 Jarvis was a patron of NaturePlaySA (South Australia), an organisation established to increase the time children spend in unstructured play outdoors and in nature to improve their fitness, problem solving ability, emotional resilience and mental wellbeing. In 2015, global education foundation Round Square inducted Jarvis as the first Idealist for Environmental Understanding. That same year, he was chosen as the Australian Museum's \\"trailblazer-in-residence\\" and included as one of Australia's 50 greatest explorers in the 2015 Trailblazers exhibition. He was the joint recipient of the Jim Bettison and Helen James Award in 2016, administered by the Adelaide Film Festival, along with dancer Meryl Tankard. In 2017, Jarvis was made a Bragg Fellow by the Royal Institution of Australia. The award recognises excellence in scientific achievement and commitment to science communication.  Expeditions  = Recreation of Douglas Mawson's expedition = In April 2007 Tim Jarvis completed an expedition in Antarctica where he attempted to recreate the pressures of the 1913 Australian Antarctic Expedition and human survival feat of Sir Douglas Mawson. Jarvis walked close to 500 km pulling a sleigh full of supplies, and living on almost the same rations as Mawson himself. Jarvis wanted to find out if the story of Mawson was physically possible. At the end of the expedition Jarvis said, \\"I haven't really done what Mawson did because I have doctors checking my situation, a film crew following me and a number of other safety precautions. Mawson had none of that.\\" The 2008 film of the expedition was released for DVD, Mawson ‚Äì Life and Death in Antarctica. The summary reads, \\"Combining the drama of Jarvis' contemporary adventure with chilling dramatic reconstructions, expert commentary and footage from the original expedition photographed by Frank Hurley, this is an extraordinary story of human survival.\\" Tim is also author of a book of the same name (Melbourne University Press, 2008 (). = Shackleton Epic = In February 2013http://shackletonepic.com/test/wp-content/uploads/SE-NEWS-RELEASE-TEAM- ARRIVES-IN-STROMNESS-11-Feb-2013.pdf Jarvis and five others successfully recreated Sir Ernest Shackleton's 'epic' crossing of the Southern Ocean in the Alexandra Shackleton, a replica of Shackleton's lifeboat the James Caird. Using the same materials, clothing, food and a Thomas Mercer chronometer as in the original voyage, Jarvis and the team sailed their replica James Caird from Elephant Island, in the Southern Ocean, to South Georgia, just as Shackleton did in 1916.Tim Jarvis . Retrieved on 9 August 2011. The construction of the replica James Caird was started in June 2008 and was finished in 2010, and was officially launched on 18 March 2012 in Dorset, England. The sea voyage was followed by a trek across the mountainous interior of South Georgia to the historic whaling station of Stromness. The project, led by Jarvis, was the first (and so far only) successful recreation of the 'double' voyage using only period gear. Members of the Shackleton's Epic crew were Nick Bubb, Barry 'Baz' Gray, Paul Larson, Seb Coulthard, and Ed Wardle. The expedition's patron was the Hon. Alexandra Shackleton, granddaughter of Sir Ernest Shackleton. Jarvis was awarded the Royal Institute of Navigation's Certificate of Achievement, in recognition of his leadership of the Shackleton Epic Expedition Team. A documentary of the epic crossing was made and Shackleton: Death or Glory went to air in the UK in September 2013 on Discovery UK and Australia in November 2013 on Special Broadcasting Service Australia; titled Chasing Shackleton for the USA market, it went to air in that region in January 2014 on the Public Broadcasting Service.http://shackletonepic.com/film/ A book authored by Tim titled Shackleton's Epic, Recreating the World's Greatest Journey of Survival, published by Harper Collins, was released in the UK and Australia in November 2013; titled Chasing Shackleton, Recreating the World's Greatest Journey of Survival for the USA market, it went on sale in January 2014 in the USA. .http://shackletonepic.com/book/  Projects  = 25zero = Tim Jarvis founded the 25zero Project to highlight the retreat of glaciers on the world's 25 glaciated equatorial mountains. He assembled a team of mountaineers and film-makers to join him in advance of COP21 to document the impact of climate change and to communicate how each of the 25 equatorial mountains will lose its glacier 'within an average 25 years'. The first short-film was broadcast live at COP21 during a government-sponsored press conference. At the time of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 25 mountains had glaciers, although since that time, four have gone extinct, leaving only 21 mountains with glaciers at the equator.

Congressmen of the Colombian Conservative Party described these enclaves, including Marquetalia, as \\"independent republics\\" which needed to be brought under state control through military force. This area was eventually overrun by the National Army of Colombia (during \\"Operation Marquetalia\\") in May 1964. Eventually some of the communist survivors reunited elsewhere and later became part of the \\"Bloque Sur\\" (Southern Bloc) guerrilla group in 1964, a precursor to the official foundation of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 1966. Historical background =La Violencia= The assassination of Jorge Eli√©cer Gait√°n in 1948 triggered large riots in Bogot√° and smaller scale uprisings throughout the country. This would mark the beginning of La Violencia, a period of intense bipartisan conflict that would cost an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 Colombian lives over the next decade. Several members of the Colombian Liberal Party and of the Colombian Communist Party had previously organized self-defense groups and guerrilla units during La Violencia that did not demobilize during the amnesty declared by General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla after he took power in 1953. When Rojas was removed from power in 1958, civilian rule was restored after moderate Conservatives and Liberals, with the support of dissident sectors of the military, agreed to unite under a bipartisan coalition known as the National Front (with included a system of presidential alternation and powersharing both in cabinets and public offices). From the point of view of members the FARC and the Colombian Communist Party, the Liberal and Conservative elites, though they had instigated the violence, soon grew to fear the consequences of it, and thus formed a loose alliance to preserve their shared desire for political hegemony from possible revolutionary challenges. Meanwhile, a small number of armed groups formed by Liberals and communists had successfully established a certain degree of self-government in remote regions of the country, one of which eventually became known as the \\"republic\\" of Marquetalia by outside observers. For the most part their activities were limited to self-defense after the end of La Violencia, though some extortions of local landowners and short skirmishes with official forces occurred from time to time. The government initially ignored the growing influence of Communists in such enclaves until 1964 when, under pressure by members of the Colombian Conservative Party in Congress who considered such autonomous \\"republics\\" as a de facto threat, the Colombian Army was ordered to attack the communist controlled \\"republic\\". In addition to the military offensive, the creation of civic action programs in the area of operations were also considered as necessary by some politicians and also members of the Colombian Army, but initial efforts to implement such programs were not followed upon in the long run. Following the attack, the guerrillas dispersed to other nearby enclaves, only to later reorganize as the \\"Southern Bloc\\" (\\"Bloque Sur\\") in 1964, officially renamed \\"Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia\\" (FARC) in 1966, which became the official military arm of the Communist Party. One of the communist leaders of the enclave, known as Jacobo Arenas, later wrote a book called \\"Diario de la resistencia de Marquetalia\\" (\\"Marquetalia Diary\\"). The book includes a chronicle of the events of the fight between the guerrilla fighters and the soldiers of the Colombian army. Plan Lazo In October 1959, the United States sent a \\"Special Survey Team\\" composed of counterinsurgency experts to investigate Colombia's internal security situation. Among other policy recommendations the US team advised that \\"in order to shield the interests of both Colombian and US authorities against 'interventionist' charges any special aid given for internal security was to be sterile and covert in nature.\\" In February 1962, three years after the 1959 \\"US Special Survey Team\\", a Fort Bragg top-level U.S. Special Warfare team headed by Special Warfare Center commander General William P. Yarborough, visited Colombia for a second survey. The new anti-terrorist policy was instituted as Plan Lazo in 1962 and called for both military operations and civic action programs in violent areas. Following Yarborough's recommendations, the Colombian military worked to combat communist terrorism and bandits guided by Liberal and Conservative parties. At the behest of the United States, the Colombian government began attacking many of the terrorist Communist organizations so-called \\"self-defense communities\\" in the early 1960s, attempting to re-assimilate the territories under the control of the national government. FARC was formed in 1964 by Manuel Marulanda V√©lez and other PCC members, after a military attack on the community of Marquetalia. 16,000 Colombian troops, backed by the U.S., attacked the village of 1,000 inhabitants, only 48 of whom were armed. Marulanda and 47 others fought against government forces at Marquetalia, and then escaped into the mountains along with the other fighters. These 48 men formed the core of FARC, which quickly grew in size to hundreds of fighters.Janicke, Kiraz \\"War vs. Peace: Colombia, Venezuela and the FARC Hostage Saga\\", Venezuela Analysis, February 9, 2008 (accessed: 09/11/2010)Bauman, Jan MITF Report, April 4, 2001 (accessed: 03/01/2010) The \\"Marquetalia Diary\\" Jacobo Arenas, surviving the invasion of Marquetalia, wrote a book called \\"Diario de la resistencia de Marquetalia\\" (\\"Marquetalia Diary\\") in 1972. The book includes a chronicle of the events of the fight between the guerrilla fighters and the soldiers of the Colombian army brigade. In the diary, Arenas describes the geographical location and the natural beauty of the Marquetalia area with many details, giving the reader a detailed mental picture of the area, made up of 800 square km in the Andes, at around 6000 feet above sea level, with the presence of monsoon rainfall. One of the snowed mountains in the department of Huila is more than 12,000 feet high. The diary puts the guerrilla and peasant struggle in Marquetalia in context, happening six years after the triumph of the 1959 Cuban Revolution, which filled the minds of many worldwide with revolutionary fervor. While the events in Cuba absorbed most of the world's and the region's attention, information about the events in Marquetalia and their aftermath later began to be of great interest throughout Latin America. The diary highlights some of the inner workings of Marquetalia as a sort of improvised commune or small socialist society, where not only the peasant fighters and Communist Party ideologues were present, but also several members of their families and some of their friends, who worked together as a community for both common socioeconomic and military/defense purposes. Arenas describes the military operations against Marquetalia in May 1964 as part of a United States initiative called Plan LASO (Latin American Security Operation), allegedly meant to suppress dissent and possible communist rebellions that might spring up in the region. In Colombia, Arenas claims that the offensive against Marquetalia was designed with assistance from the Pentagon and alleges that some 16,000 Colombian Army troops, with the support of military helicopters and airplanes, took part in the operation (the terms used in the book are: 16,000 \\"Bloodhounds\\" commanded by the Pentagon \\"Hawks\\"). The number of peasant communist fighters was thought to be much smaller, but a previous CIA intelligence report argued that it could reach as many as 2,000, though other estimates and claims have since differed, with most saying 1,600 Colombian troops were involved. Arenas tells how the fighters scattered, soon regrouped to give birth to the FARC, the former fighters of Marquetalia hide in jungles and remote villages throughout Colombia, reorganizing to fight a war by using irregular techniques in order to some day seize power. Aftermath: the Birth of FARC After the implementation of Plan LASO's military phase in May 1964, the survivors of the Marquetalia \\"commune\\" held a meeting on May 27, with key leaders such Manuel Marulanda and Jacobo Arenas. The agenda of this meeting was to create a more formal insurgent organization with the main goal of seizing power from capitalists and directing Colombian society according to Marxist doctrine. At the end of the meeting, clearly defined ideas were in place, which continued to be used for the later birth of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC in 1966. According to the leftist insurgents, their plan was to spread all over Colombia into areas such as remote villages and jungles for security reasons, while others traveled throughout Latin America to gain experience as part of their armed struggle. The FARC's Seventh Guerrilla Conference was held in 1982 under the guidance of Jacobo Arenas and Manuel Marulanda. The Conference added the term \\"People's Army\\" to the group, resulting in the new name being FARC-EP. The Seventh Guerrilla Conference was a turning point in the FARC's struggle, as it provided them the opportunity to fine-tune their policies and plans in order for them to build their desired socialist state in the future. The FARC's Conferences, as seen by Marxists and Leninists, can be interpreted as similar to the International conferences previously held in Europe with the participation Karl Marx, Fredrick Engels, Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. Today the FARC-EP is considered the oldest guerrilla group in the world. They continue to carry out attacks in various parts of Colombia.

Macbeth applause at Savonlinna Opera festival in 2007. The origins of Finnish opera can be traced to the late 18th or 19th century, when the first opera performances were staged in Finland. It is generally assumed that the first opera performance in Finland took place in 1768 in Turku, when the troupe of Carl Gottlieb Seuerling presented the opera Adam und Eva by Johann Theile. However other sources state that there was no orchestra at this performance. The first opera to be composed in Finland was Kung Karls jakt with music by Fredrik Pacius and a libretto by Zacharias Topelius. It was first performed in Helsinki on 24 March 1852.Ruth-Esther Hillila and Barbara Blanchard Hong: Historical Dictionary of the Music and Musicians of Finland (Greenwood, 1997) p.293 The first opera performance in Finnish language is supposed to be Lucia di Lammermoor presented by the Finnish National Theatre in 1873. There were 25-30 operas in the repertoire of the company. The Domestic Opera established by Aino Ackt√© and Edvard Fazer gave its first performance 2 October 1911. It later became the Finnish National Opera. Savonlinna Opera Festival takes place annually at the medieval Olavinlinna in the city of Savonlinna. Aino Ackt√© organised the first festival in Savonlinna summer 1912. After Finland gained independence in 1917, Russian- owned Alexander Theatre become property of Finland. It was given \\"temporarily\\" for the Finnish Opera, which used it for 70 years while waiting for the purpose-built opera house to be constructed. Finnish opera got international reputation in the 1970s with works by Joonas Kokkonen and Aulis Sallinen. Kokkonen's opera Last temptations (1975) was staged in Metropolitan in New York in 1983 and received over 500 performances worldwide. Famous singers include Matti Salminen, Martti Talvela, Karita Mattila and Soile Isokoski. BBC Music Magazine named Mattila as one of the top 20 sopranos of the recorded era in 2007.

He was previously a Tasmanian Greens member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly elected at the 2002 election, representing the Franklin electorate from 2002 to 2015, and led the party from 2008 until 2014. On 21 April 2010, he became the first member of the Greens in any Australian ministry.Lehman, Ros: \\"Nick McKim: From hiking guide to the Senate\\", ABC, 30 Jul 2015 Background McKim was born in London, England. When he was five years old, his family emigrated from the UK to Australia. He attended the Hutchins School, Kingston High School, then Hobart College. He lived in Adelaide, South Australia, before moving to Tasmania. Before entering parliament, McKim worked as a wilderness guide and advertising executive. McKim served time in prison after being arrested during the Farmhouse Creek Blockade in the early 1980s.  Citizenship concerns  The issue of Nick McKim's citizenship was raised during the 2017‚Äì18 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis while he was a sitting senator. McKim applied to renounce his UK citizenship by filling out the renunciation form (RN) on the 31st of July 2015. The form was received by the British Home Office on the 14th of August 2015, further received for processing on the 4th of September 2015, and formally registered on the 1st of February 2016. The Home Office citizenship renunciation guidelines state that a person will cease being a British citizen after the date of registration. Because McKim's RN form was not registered until the 1st of February 2016, he maintained dual citizenship while serving as a senator, in breach of the Australian constitution, from the 20th of August 2015 (when he was sworn in as the retiring Christine Milne's replacement) until the 1st of February 2016, a period of just over 5 months. Since nominations for the 2016 federal election occurred after McKim's citizenship was formally renounced, he was not in breach of section 44(i) when nominating for that election. Political career Elected to Tasmanian House of Assembly in the Division of Franklin at the 2002 election, McKim was re-elected at the 2006 election, receiving 15.93 per cent of first preferences, an increase compared to his previous vote of 12.59%. He replaced Peg Putt as Leader of the Tasmanian Greens when Putt retired from Parliament in 2008. McKim supported the government in passing the same sex relationships bill (which recognises same sex relationships in Tasmania under common law) and has promoted the Greens' own Same-Sex Marriage Bill. During 2008, he campaigned against the use of 1080 poison, forestry practices and the state's anti-terrorism bill. =Tasmanian government minister= In the 2010 Tasmanian election McKim achieved 24.1% of first preferences in his lower house seat. On 19 April 2010, Labor premier David Bartlett agreed to appoint McKim as a minister along with Cassy O'Connor as cabinet secretary. As a minister, McKim originally held the portfolios of Sustainable Transport and Alternative Energy, Corrections and Consumer Protection, Climate Change, Human Services, and Community Development: though he delegated responsibility for the portfolios of Human Services and Community Development to fellow Greens MP and then cabinet secretary Cassy O'Connor. After a Cabinet reshuffle in November 2010 the portfolios of human services and community development were formally assumed by newly appointed Greens minister Cassy O'Connor, whilst McKim was sworn in as minister for the newly created Aboriginal Affairs portfolio alongside his other three portfolios. Another Cabinet reshuffle, caused by Lin Thorp losing her seat in the Tasmanian Legislative Council elections and David Bartlett resigning from the assembly, then saw McKim sworn in on 13 May 2011 as Minister for Education and Skills, whilst retaining the three portfolios of corrections, consumer protection and sustainable transport. McKim was responsible for overseeing the closing of the Hayes Prison Farm and the removal of Flex Learning for prisoners as Minister for both portfolio areas of Education and Corrections. On 16 January 2014, the premier, Lara Giddings, announced that the power sharing arrangement with the Tasmanian Greens was over, and that McKim and O'Connor would be replaced by Labor MPs effective on 17 January. She said that the ALP would not govern with Greens in the cabinet in future. McKim was re- elected to the House of Assembly at the 2014 Tasmanian State Election with 13.4% of the primary vote. =Federal politics= After Christine Milne's resignation from the senate, McKim was announced to be one of the 10 Greens members vying to replace her. The ballot, open to Greens members, was held in July 2015. The Tasmanian Greens announced at a press conference on 30 July 2015 that McKim had won the membership ballot to replace Christine Milne in the Senate.https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/30/nick-mckim- to-replace-christine-milne-as-greens-senator-for-tasmania He resigned from the Tasmanian Parliament on 4 August, and a countback was conducted to elect Rosalie Woodruff as his replacement on 17 August. McKim was appointed to the Senate by a joint sitting of the Tasmanian Parliament on 19 August 2015. Unlike other Greens Senators, Senator McKim has had ministerial experience due to him having been a minister in the previous Tasmanian ALP Government whilst as State Greens leader. McKim was re-elected to the Senate at the 2019 federal election where he received 12.4% of the state's vote, with a swing of 1.41% in his favour. Alongside serving as Co-Deputy Leader of the Greens with Senator Larissa Waters, McKim also acts as the Greens' spokesperson for the following: * Treasury, Finance & Economic Justice * Immigration & Citizenship * Digital Rights, I.T. & the National Broadband Network Personal life In July 2009, McKim confirmed he was in a relationship with Cassy O'Connor, also a Tasmanian Greens Member of the House of Assembly.

In The Fast Show, Harding's sketches often involved nothing more than his character saying \\"Hi, I'm Ed Winchester\\" to camera (in the style of a TV news reporter). He also appeared in the 1990s remake of The Tomorrow People as General Damon. In the BBC docudrama series Seven Wonders of the Industrial World he played the part of chief engineer John Frank Stevens in the episode dedicated to the building of the Panama Canal. He guest-starred in the CW series Life is Wild in the episode \\"Open for Business\\". He voices Vincent Meis in the video game The Witcher and guest-starred in the CBBC series The Basil Brush Show in 2003 in the episode Fit for Nothing, playing Healthy Harry. Previous to his showbusiness career, he taught in Morocco and later became a Master Carpenter at the Palace Theatre.

On a K√§hler manifold, plurisubharmonic functions form a subset of the subharmonic functions. However, unlike subharmonic functions (which are defined on a Riemannian manifold) plurisubharmonic functions can be defined in full generality on complex analytic spaces. Formal definition A function :f \\\\colon G \\\\to {\\\\mathbb{R}}\\\\cup{-\\\\infty}, with domain G \\\\subset {\\\\mathbb{C}}^n is called plurisubharmonic if it is upper semi-continuous, and for every complex line :{ a + b z \\\\mid z \\\\in {\\\\mathbb{C}} }\\\\subset {\\\\mathbb{C}}^n with a, b \\\\in {\\\\mathbb{C}}^n the function z \\\\mapsto f(a + bz) is a subharmonic function on the set :{ z \\\\in {\\\\mathbb{C}} \\\\mid a + b z \\\\in G }. In full generality, the notion can be defined on an arbitrary complex manifold or even a Complex analytic space X as follows. An upper semi- continuous function :f \\\\colon X \\\\to {\\\\mathbb{R}} \\\\cup { - \\\\infty } is said to be plurisubharmonic if and only if for any holomorphic map \\\\varphi\\\\colon\\\\Delta\\\\to X the function :f\\\\circ\\\\varphi \\\\colon \\\\Delta \\\\to {\\\\mathbb{R}} \\\\cup { - \\\\infty } is subharmonic, where \\\\Delta\\\\subset{\\\\mathbb{C}} denotes the unit disk. =Differentiable plurisubharmonic functions= If f is of (differentiability) class C^2, then f is plurisubharmonic if and only if the hermitian matrix L_f=(\\\\lambda_{ij}), called Levi matrix, with entries : \\\\lambda_{ij}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2f}{\\\\partial z_i\\\\partial\\\\bar z_j} is positive semidefinite. Equivalently, a C^2-function f is plurisubharmonic if and only if \\\\sqrt{-1}\\\\partial\\\\bar\\\\partial f is a positive (1,1)-form. Examples Relation to K√§hler manifold: On n-dimensional complex Euclidean space \\\\mathbb{C}^n , f(z) = z^2 is plurisubharmonic. In fact, \\\\sqrt{-1}\\\\partial\\\\overline{\\\\partial}f is equal to the standard K√§hler form on \\\\mathbb{C}^n up to constant multiples. More generally, if g satisfies ::\\\\sqrt{-1}\\\\partial\\\\overline{\\\\partial}g=\\\\omega for some K√§hler form \\\\omega, then g is plurisubharmonic, which is called K√§hler potential. Relation to Dirac Delta: On 1-dimensional complex Euclidean space \\\\mathbb{C}^1 , u(z) = \\\\log(z) is plurisubharmonic. If f is a C‚àû-class function with compact support, then Cauchy integral formula says ::f(0)=-\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{-1}}{2\\\\pi}\\\\int_C\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial\\\\bar{z}}\\\\frac{dzd\\\\bar{z}}{z} which can be modified to ::\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{-1}}{\\\\pi}\\\\partial\\\\overline{\\\\partial}\\\\logz=dd^c\\\\logz. It is nothing but Dirac measure at the origin 0 . More Examples * If f is an analytic function on an open set, then \\\\logf is plurisubharmonic on that open set. * Convex functions are plurisubharmonic * If \\\\Omega is a Domain of Holomorphy then -\\\\log (dist(z,\\\\Omega^c)) is plurisubharmonic * Harmonic functions are not necessarily plurisubharmonic History Plurisubharmonic functions were defined in 1942 by Kiyoshi Oka K. Oka, Domaines pseudoconvexes, Tohoku Math. J. 49 (1942), 15-52. and Pierre Lelong.P. Lelong, Definition des fonctions plurisousharmoniques, C. R. Acd. Sci. Paris 215 (1942), 398-400. Properties *The set of plurisubharmonic functions form a convex cone in the vector space of semicontinuous functions, i.e. :* if f is a plurisubharmonic function and c>0 a positive real number, then the function c\\\\cdot f is plurisubharmonic, :* if f_1 and f_2 are plurisubharmonic functions, then the sum f_1+f_2 is a plurisubharmonic function. *Plurisubharmonicity is a local property, i.e. a function is plurisubharmonic if and only if it is plurisubharmonic in a neighborhood of each point. *If f is plurisubharmonic and \\\\phi:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} a monotonically increasing, convex function then \\\\phi\\\\circ f is plurisubharmonic. *If f_1 and f_2 are plurisubharmonic functions, then the function f(x):=\\\\max(f_1(x),f_2(x)) is plurisubharmonic. *If f_1,f_2,\\\\dots is a monotonically decreasing sequence of plurisubharmonic functions then f(x):=\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}f_n(x) is plurisubharmonic. *Every continuous plurisubharmonic function can be obtained as the limit of a monotonically decreasing sequence of smooth plurisubharmonic functions. Moreover, this sequence can be chosen uniformly convergent.R. E. Greene and H. Wu, C^\\\\infty- approximations of convex, subharmonic, and plurisubharmonic functions, Ann. Scient. Ec. Norm. Sup. 12 (1979), 47-84. *The inequality in the usual semi- continuity condition holds as equality, i.e. if f is plurisubharmonic then : \\\\limsup_{x\\\\to x_0}f(x) =f(x_0) (see limit superior and limit inferior for the definition of lim sup). * Plurisubharmonic functions are subharmonic, for any K√§hler metric. *Therefore, plurisubharmonic functions satisfy the maximum principle, i.e. if f is plurisubharmonic on the connected open domain D and : \\\\sup_{x\\\\in D}f(x) =f(x_0) for some point x_0\\\\in D then f is constant. Applications In complex analysis, plurisubharmonic functions are used to describe pseudoconvex domains, domains of holomorphy and Stein manifolds. Oka theorem The main geometric application of the theory of plurisubharmonic functions is the famous theorem proven by Kiyoshi Oka in 1942. A continuous function f:\\\\; M \\\\mapsto {\\\\mathbb R} is called exhaustive if the preimage f^{-1}(]-\\\\infty, c]) is compact for all c\\\\in {\\\\mathbb R}. A plurisubharmonic function f is called strongly plurisubharmonic if the form \\\\sqrt{-1}(\\\\partial\\\\bar\\\\partial f-\\\\omega) is positive, for some K√§hler form \\\\omega on M. Theorem of Oka: Let M be a complex manifold, admitting a smooth, exhaustive, strongly plurisubharmonic function. Then M is Stein. Conversely, any Stein manifold admits such a function.

The estuary is made up of saltwater marshes, raised salt marsh, wet meadows and riverine shallows and creeks. It covers an area of , and is divided by a causeway and bridge built in the 1840s to carry the main Dublin‚ÄìBelfast railway line. It is internationally recognised as one of the most important east coast sites and is vital for wintering wildfowl and waders and birds on passage. Birds come to the estuary from the Arctic. It supports an internationally important population of Brent Geese and a further 14 species in numbers of national importance. The site is a statutory Nature Reserve and a candidate Special Area of Conservation under the E.U. Habitats Directive. The estuary's mouth separates the beaches of Portrane and Rush; and the mouth is so narrow, it is theorized that a person would be able to cross from Rush to Portrane at gradual walking pace, within a timespan of less than a minute, if there was no water. According to local legend, there was once a bridge across the mouth, however, it was dismantled after various suicides. An apparent remain of this bridge still exists today, on the Portrane beach.

It had a long tail, although incomplete on the best preserved fossils. It is possible that the tail was longer than (or at least as long as) its body. 17 vertebrae were preserved, and its estimated that there was 5 to 10 additional vertebrae originally. It is regarded as partially arboreal, and partially terrestrial.  Taxonomy  A 2016 phylogenetic analysis recovered Pucadelphys as a member of a metatherian clade including sparassodonts and other South American taxa, but not marsupials (which are instead closer to Cretaceous North American species).

His father William Craven was born in a poor family in Appletreewick in North Yorkshire but moved to London, became wealthy, and was Lord Mayor of London in 1610. He married Elizabeth Whitmore, sister of George Whitmore, a later Lord Mayor of London. Their other children included John Craven, 1st Baron Craven of Ryton,Shropshire Arch. Transactions 3rd Series Vol 11901 Manor of Ruyton XI Towns by Robert Lloyd Kenyon Mary, who married Thomas Coventry, 2nd Baron Coventry and Elizabeth, who married Percy Herbert, 2nd Baron Powis. Craven matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford in 1623, aged 15, and was created M.A. in 1636. Craven fought for Frederick V on the Continent and fell in love with his wife, Elizabeth of Bohemia. Still being absent during the English Civil War, he supported this lady's brother, Charles I, financially rather than in person and, therefore, had all his lands ‚Äì largely in Berkshire, but including his main country seat at Caversham Park in Oxfordshire ‚Äì confiscated. After the Restoration, he set about planning to build a vast palace for Elizabeth at Hamstead Marshall in Berkshire with a hunting lodge at nearby Ashdown (now in Oxfordshire), but she died before construction of the palace began. Perhaps because of his devotion to Elizabeth, he never married. After the Restoration, he was rewarded with several Court offices and given an earldom. He was granted a share in the Colony of Carolina and served as one of its Lord Proprietors. As a Privy Councillor he seems to have been diligent enough: Samuel Pepys in his Diary regularly mentions his attendance at the committee for Tangier and his chairing of the Committee on Fisheries. In the latter role Pepys was rather shocked by his bawdy language which Pepys thought improper in a councillor (though perhaps natural in an old soldier). In 1678 we read of his presence at the historic Council meeting where Titus Oates first publicised the Popish Plot. Pepys's attitude to Craven varies in the Diary- on the one hand he calls him a coxcomb and criticises his chairing of the Fisheries Committee; at other times he is glad that Craven is his \\"very good friend\\". Whatever Pepys's opinion of him, Craven earned the lasting respect and gratitude of the people of London during the Great Plague of 1665 when, unlike the great majority of noblemen, who fled to the country, he remained in London, helping to maintain order and donating property for burial grounds. Craven County, North Carolina is named after William. An older Craven. References *Ford, David Nash (2001).

He also made 17 appearances for the England national team. Career Born in Sheffield, Scott joined Bradford City as a youth player, and played 39 times for The Bantams, mostly as a Winger. In February 1937 he was signed by Arsenal, in exchange for Ernie Tuckett, though he only played as a reserve for the first two years at the club. At the start of World War II, Scott joined the Royal Air Force as a PT instructor, but still guested as a player for the RAF, Arsenal, Sheffield United, and England in wartime matches. By the time peace broke out, Scott had grown into being one of the country's most assured full backs, known for his pace and composure on the ball. He made his official first-team debut for Arsenal against West Ham United in the FA Cup in 1946, and his League debut on the first day of the 1946-47 season; he also made his official England debut against Ireland in September of that year. Arsenal won the First Division title in 1947-48, but after that Scott was blighted by injury; he was stricken with a bout of appendicitis in 1948, and then injured his knee whilst playing in an international for England against Wales on 10 November 1948. Scott was out for the rest of the 1948-49 season and his appearances for Arsenal were limited for the next few seasons. However, he still figured in Arsenal's 1950 FA Cup-winning side and after a successful run in the England B side, he was picked for England's squad for the 1950 FIFA World Cup. By now though, he was 33, and had not played for his country for two years; England's first choice right-back for the entire tournament was Alf Ramsey, and Scott did not play a single minute. In 1950-51 Scott played 17 matches for Arsenal, but with his injury often recurring, he was no longer automatic first-team choice, sharing the right-back position with Walley Barnes. In all he played for Arsenal in 127 official matches (and 191 unofficial wartime matches), and 17 times for England (plus 16 wartime caps). He joined Crystal Palace as player-manager in October 1951. He managed the Eagles (then known as the Glaziers) for three years, but with little success; the club had to apply for re-admission to the Football League at the end of the 1953-54 season. He later had stints with non-league Hendon and Hitchin Town, reaching the semi-finals of the FA Amateur Cup twice with the latter. He died in July 1999 after a long illness, aged 82 years.

On the left is Helen de Guerry Simpson, the Isle of Wight Prospective Liberal Candidate Wilfrid Hubert Wace Roberts (28 August 1900 ‚Äì 26 May 1991) was a radical British Liberal Party politician who later joined the Labour Party. Personal life Roberts was born to Charles Henry Roberts, who became Liberal MP for Lincoln, and Lady Cecilia Maude Roberts, daughter of the 9th Earl of Carlisle; the artist Winifred Nicholson was his elder sister.Conqueror18 He was educated at Gresham's School, Holt, Norfolk, and Balliol College, Oxford.Roberts, Wilfrid Hubert Wace, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920‚Äì2015; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 accessed 10 June 2015 A farmer, Roberts in 1934 and 1935 broadcast two series of talks, Living in Cumberland, on the BBC Home Service.The Times House of Commons, 1935 He commissioned Leslie Martin to work on Banks House, near Brampton, Cumberland, in 1937. From September 1943 A. J. Ayer was a lodger in his flat near the House of Commons. Ayer had not previously known Roberts, and described him as \\"very tall, unmistakably English, quiet, with an undercurrent of strong feeling, cultivated and philanthropic.\\" Roberts was also the owner of the Carlisle Journal newspaper, which ceased publication in 1969. He served as a Justice of the peace. Political career Roberts's first political involvement came as a district councillor. He described the tradition of Cumbrian local politics in an interview with Hunter Davies for A Walk Along the Wall (1974): > There's always been a branch of the Howard family which has been radical. In > this area three families have been running things for decades, the Howards, > the Grahams of Netherby, and the Lowthers. I've tried to keep the anti-Tory > tradition alive, fighting our traditional Tory rival families, the Lowthers > and the Grahams. =Election as Member of Parliament= Roberts first stood for parliament, without success, for North Cumberland in 1931, losing by 1,277 votes. Roberts became a Member of Parliament (MP) for North Cumberland at the 1935 election, gaining the seat from the Conservatives. The Labour Party did not contest the seat, a tribute to his existing reputation as a radical. Sir Archibald Sinclair, the Liberal leader, appointed Roberts an Assistant Whip in the House of Commons, working under the Chief Whip Sir Percy Harris. Following on from his BBC talks on Living in Cumberland, Roberts was chosen by the BBC as one of their regular speakers on The Week at Westminster. An internal BBC memo in 1939 described Roberts as having a \\"pleasant manner\\". In June and July 1936, Dudley Aman, 1st Baron Marley and Roberts were in Budapest, negotiating on behalf of M√°ty√°s R√°kosi. =Spanish Civil War= At the time of the Spanish Civil War, Roberts was nicknamed \\"MP for Spain\\". He led a delegation of six Members of Parliament to Republican Spain in November 1936. Roberts was Secretary of the National Joint Committee for Spanish Relief, the formation of which from the Parliamentary Committee for Spain he proposed. He worked with Conservative MP Katharine Stewart-Murray, Duchess of Atholl, as Chair,Time magazine, 11 July 1938. David Grenfell of the Labour Party, and Eleanor Rathbone the Independent MP,Susan Pedersen, Eleanor Rathbone and the Politics of Conscience (2004) , p. 286. from 1937 to 1940.A Summary Description of the papers of Wilfrid Roberts With the Conservative MP John Macnamara, Roberts was also joint secretary of the Basque Children's Committee.Stoneham Camp He worked in the relief effort for Basque refugees, with Christopher Hill as one of his colleagues.Basque Colonies in Great Britain The initial reception camp for Basque children was at Stoneham in Hampshire, and was organised by Roberts and Henry Brinton, in response to the relief efforts of Leah Manning in May 1937 at Bilbao. In June Roberts announced with the Countess of Atholl that over 1000 children had been moved from the camp to Catholic homes. =Popular Front= Roberts was a supporter of the Popular Front seeking an alliance between left-of-centre political forces.Martin Pugh, The Liberal Party and the Popular Front, English Historical Review (2006); CXXI: 1327-1350 The Popular Front was not officially endorsed by the Liberal Party, but was supported by a number of other Liberal MPs such as Megan Lloyd George and Richard Acland. Roberts spoke at the 1938 Emergency Conference for a Popular Front.David Blaazer, The Popular Front and the Progressive Tradition (1992), p. 180. He was embarrassed and angry, however, when he was chairing the Spain Conference in the Queen's Hall, and the \\"Internationale\\" was sung. At this period he was an active speaker for the Left Book Club (LBC), a publishing company founded in 1936, with Acland. The Popular Front gained additional credibility when it was advocated by Sir Stafford Cripps. Both Roberts and Acland were counted by Cripps in \\"The Group\\", his cadre of supporters gathered after he was expelled from the Labour Party in early 1939. The LBC organisation had grown to the point that it held public meetings and rallies. John Strachey in late 1938 saw the move by which Acland, Cripps and Roberts were proposed as additions to the LBC book selection committee as the beginning of an \\"Anti-Fascist Association\\". As an LBC speaker, Roberts was in a Popular Front group prepared to share platforms, with Acland, Sir Norman Angell, Cripps, David Lloyd George, Hewlett Johnson, Harry Pollitt, Paul Robeson and Strachey. He spoke with most of them on 24 April 1939, at the Empress Hall, Earl's Court, for the third annual LBC rally. =Second World War= At the outbreak of the Second World War, Roberts was commissioned into the Border Regiment. He returned to politics, however, and in 1941 was in the Air Ministry. There he served as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Liberal Leader, Sir Archibald Sinclair, who at the time was Secretary of State for Air in the Coalition Government. 1941 In November 1941 Lancelot Spicer founded the \\"Liberal Action Group\\" or \\"Radical Action\\", a pressure group inside the Liberal Party. It lobbied for the party to withdraw from the wartime electoral truce and sought to rally progressive opinion irrespective of party. Roberts was a founding member of the group, along with Megan Lloyd George, Thomas Horabin, Clement Davies, Vernon Bartlett, and William Beveridge.Liberal Crusader: The Life of Sir Archibald Sinclair By Gerard J. De Groot Roberts tried to re- energise the Liberal Party machine during the war years. He became Chairman of the Organising Committee of the party. The party headquarters moved back into central London in December 1941, and he worked to reconstruct Liberal organisations. At the end of 1941 a group consisting of the Conservative Herbert Williams, Clement Davies, and Roberts began pressing for a reorganised government. Davies attacked Winston Churchill's running of the War Cabinet. Churchill brushed Davies aside, but Roberts backed him in a public speech. His position as PPS to Sinclair made this an awkward situation, and Sinclair made an offer to Churchill to sack him. Churchill turned it down, but said Sinclair should \\"teach him how to spell\\". 1942 This year saw open discontent with Winston Churchill's leadership, involving some Conservatives. James Chuter Ede observed mealtime meetings in the House, on 21 January seeing Roberts sitting with Tories (Charles Emmott, Arthur Evans), and a group from other parties.The others were Richard Acland, Aneurin Bevan, William Cove Rhys Davies and Richard Stokes. Roberts on 26 March opened the \\"Freedom of the Press\\" debate caused by a Philip Zec cartoon in the Daily Mirror, aimed at the Battle of the Atlantic, and called \\"wicked\\" by Herbert Morrison. He argued that the cartoon's target was the \\"wasters of oil\\". According to Maurice Edelman, Roberts was an \\"uninspiring speaker\\" who had difficulty holding an audience in the Commons, but on this occasion rumour had it that the government sought a \\"showdown\\" with the Mirror, through Morrison and Brendan Bracken, and the House filled. Roberts finished with a quote from Bracken on \\"blindfold democracy\\". Sir Irving Albery followed, in sympathy with the argument. Hugh Cudlipp wrote later that Defence Regulation 2D, which Morrison had applied in the past, was \\"a version of the stocks\\", and his account of the debate was that Roberts led Liberals and Socialists against Morrison, who \\"suffered\\" at the hands of Aneurin Bevan and Fred Bellenger, who quoted back at Morrison something he had written as a pacifist of World War I. Edelman points out that Ellen Wilkinson supported Morrison. The outcome that the government made no further efforts to silence the Mirror as critic. On 19 May, Chuter Ede observed, at a \\"Liberal table\\" with Roberts the sole Liberal, there were a diverse group: Evans and Reginald Clarry (Conservatives), Alexander Erskine-Hill (Scottish Unionist), Geoffrey Shakespeare (National Liberal) and Bevan (Labour). Percy Harris with difficulty sat down. Chuter Ede considered it a \\"Cave of Adullam\\". From mid-1942 Roberts was chair of the Food and Agriculture subcommittee of the Liberals' Reconstruction Committee. Later in 1942 he was behind moves to get the annual Liberal Party Assembly in August to debate a series of progressive social policies. Lord Meston let it be known that he thought potential supporters who were businessmen might be lost to the party. In September 1942 MI5 paid some attention to Roberts, as reported in Guy Liddell's diaries (23 September). Claud Cockburn was using a small group of contacts to research stories for his scandal sheet, This Week, in an effort to embarrass the government. Derek Tangye, then a journalist, was included, as were Roberts and Douglas Hyde: but covertly Tangye was working for MI5. 1943 The Beveridge Report was published in November 1942. in which Beveridge outlined his programme for social reform. Following its publication, Roberts declared himself a supporter of the proposals. At a 1943 Liberal conference, he told the gathering \\"We must plan our economic system to make the very best use of all our resources\\". In August 1943 Roberts was part of a delegation of senior Liberal party members who met with leaders of the Liberal Nationals to discuss the possibility of merger. The discussions came to nothing. In 1944 he urged his party leader Sinclair to agree to take part in a series of public meetings, advancing Liberal party policy. Sinclair declined, commenting that the other party leaders, Churchill and Attlee, were not doing so. In his diary entry for 29 November 1943, Guy Liddell recorded another MI5 investigation of Roberts, It concerned leaked documents, passed to Roberts to form the basis of a parliamentary question, in concert with the Evening Standard. 1945 In 1945 Roberts went on a mission to Moscow, to meet Stalin, and published a pamphlet in April of that year with his views of the USSR. He was re-elected to parliament in the 1945 general election. =Post- war period= After the war Roberts became chairman of the House of Commons Estimates sub-committee. He went on the mission to China led by Charles Ammon, 1st Baron Ammon.The other members were Lord Amulree, James Harrison, Martin Lindsay and Frank McLeavy. On 19 April 1949 he opened an attack on the Labour government over the Amethyst Incident, stating that it would be better to improve relations with the Chinese Communist Party. His suggestion was supported by Woodrow Wyatt, then rejected by Walter Fletcher. At the 1950 general election, following boundary changes, he contested the re-drawn seat of Penrith and the Border but lost to the Conservative. In the three previous elections, Labour had not opposed him but, in 1950, they intervened and cost him his seat. In July 1956 Roberts joined the Labour Party and at the 1959 election fought Hexham as a Labour candidate without success. He was elected as a Labour councillor in Carlisle. Family Roberts was married three times. Firstly, in 1923, to Margaret Jennings, who died in 1924, shortly after the birth of a daughter; secondly, in 1928, to Anne Constance Davis Jennings, with whom he had two further daughters, the marriage ending in divorce in 1957; and thirdly, to Kate Sawyer. His first two wives were sisters, daughters of James George Jennings of Muir Central College.Who's Who 1990 (A. & C.

Cells greatly vary by their furnishings, hygienic services, and cleanliness, both across countries and based on the level of punishment to which the person being held has been sentenced. Cells can be occupied by one or multiple people depending on factors that include, but are not limited to, inmate population, facility size, resources, or inmate behavior. Description 19th century prison cell in Pawiak, Warsaw The International Committee of the Red Cross recommends that cells be at least 5.4 m2 in size. Prison cells vary in size internationally from 2 m2 in Guinea, 3 m2 in Poland, 7 m2 in Germanyhttp://www.ra-wurster.de/strafrecht/strafvollzug/haftraum-groesse-und- unterbringung/ to 10 m2 in Norway and 12 m2 in Switzerland. Council of Europe (Strasbourg, 15 December 2015) call for a minimum standard for personal living space in prison establishments is 6m¬≤ of living space for a single-occupancy cell or 4m¬≤ of living space per prisoner in a multiple-occupancy cell for the prevention of torture and inhuman treatment. In the United States old prison cells are usually about 6 by 8 feet in dimension which is 48 square feet (moreover however American Correctional Association standards call for a minimum of 70 square feet = 6,5 m2), with steel or brick walls and one solid or barred door that locks from the outside. Many modern prison cells are pre- cast. Solid doors typically have a window that allows the prisoner to be observed from the outside. Furnishings and fixtures inside the cell are constructed so that they cannot be easily broken, and are anchored to the walls or floor. Stainless steel lavatories and commodes are also used. This prevents vandalism or the making of weapons. There are a number of prison and prison cell configurations, from simple police-station holding cells to massive cell blocks in larger correctional facilities. The practice of assigning only one inmate to each cell in a prison is called single-celling. In many countries, the cells are dirty and have very few facilities. Other countries may house many offenders in prisons, making the cells crowded.ABC.net.auSmh.com.au Prison cells in the UK In the United Kingdom, cells in a police station are the responsibility of the Custody Sergeant, who also logs each detainee and allocates him or her an available cell. Custody Sergeants also ensure cells are clean and as germ-free as possible, in accordance with the Human Rights Act of 1998. Prison cells in the US In the United States, the standard cell is equipped with either a ledge or a steel bedstead that holds a mattress. A one-piece sink/toilet constructed of welded, putatively stainless steel is also provided. Bars typify older jails, while newer ones have doors that typically feature a small safety glass window and, often, a metal flap that can be opened to serve meals. A limited number of United States prisons offer upgrades. Costing around $100 a night, these cells are considered cleaner and quieter, and some of them offer extra facilities.  High-security cells  Often, different standards for cells exist in a single country and even in a single jail. Some of those cells are reserved for \\"isolation\\", where a convict is kept alone in a cell as punishment method. Some isolation cells contain no furnishing and no services at all.

He was the only eunuch to ever claim the throne of Assyria. Nothing is known of Sin-shumu-lishir's background or family and he first appears as a prominent courtier and general in the reign of Ashur-etil- ilani (631‚Äì627 BC). After the death of Ashur-etil-ilani's father and predecessor Ashurbanipal (669‚Äì631 BC), Sin-shumu-lishir was instrumental in securing Ashur-etil-ilani's rise to the throne and consolidating his position as king by defeating attempted revolts against his rule. It is possible that Sin-shumu-lishir, as a prominent general close to the king, was the de facto ruler of Assyria throughout Ashur-etil-ilani's reign. Ashur-etil-ilani died in 627 BC after a very short reign and in the following year, Sin-shumu-lishir rebelled against Ashur-etil-ilani's brother and successor Sinsharishkun, possibly due to feeling that his prominent position was threatened by the rise of the new king. Sin-shumu-lishir successfully seized cities such as Nippur and Babylon but was defeated by Sinsharishkun after just three months. Biography  Further \\"beardless king\\" seal impressions from Nineveh, possibly depicting Sin-shumu-lishir. Nothing is known of Sin-shumu-lishir's background or family.' He was a eunuch and probably already a prominent courtier during the reign of Ashurbanipal (r. 669‚Äì631 BC)' Eunuchs had often been appointed to prominent government positions in the Assyrian Empire because they could have no dynastic aspirations and thus in the mind of the Assyrians could not represent potential threats.' After Ashurbanipal's death, Sin-shumu-lishir played a key role in securing the rise of his son Ashur-etil- ilani to the throne, probably with the aid of his own private soldiers.' Sin- shumu-lishir is then first mentioned in Assyrian sources as the rab ≈°a rƒì≈°i (great/chief eunuch)' of Ashur-etil-ilani.' He is likely to have been the head of Ashur-etil-ilani's household' and was probably a prominent general who had served the new king since his youth.' As in many other successions in Assyrian history, Ashur-etil-ilani's rise to the Assyrian throne in 631 BC was initially met with opposition and unrest.' An official named Nabu-rihtu-usur attempted to seize the Assyrian throne with the help of another official called Sin-shar-ibni. As the king's rab ≈°a rƒì≈°i, it is likely that Sin-shumu- lishir played a role in suppressing the conspiracy, which appears to have been crushed relatively quickly.' In addition to suppressing the revolt, there is also a preserved tablet which records a treaty imposed by Sin-shumu-lishir on three private individuals, guaranteeing Ashur-etil-ilani's sovereignty.' The text of this treaty is highly similar to the succession treaties created by Ashur-etil-ilani's grandfather Esarhaddon in the 670s BC to ensure the succession of Ashurbanipal.' Sin-shumu-lishir is also recorded as receiving land from Ashur-etil-ilani, possibly as a rewards for his service to the king.' It is possible that Sin-shumu-lishir, as a prominent general closely tied to the king, was the de facto ruler of Assyria during Ashur-etil-ilani's reign. Ashur-etil-ilani died under obscure circumstances in 627 BC, after just four years as king. Ashur-etil-ilani's Babylonian vassal king Kandalanu also died at roughly the same time and Ashur-etil-ilani's brother Sinsharishkun assumed rulership of the entire Neo-Assyrian Empire. Immediately after Sinsharishkun became king, Sin-shumu-lishir rebelled against him, possibly due to feeling that his prominent position was threatened by the rise of a new king.' Though a military leader attempting to claim the throne during a time of crisis and succession wasn't necessarily unusual, the possibility that a eunuch would do so had never been entertained prior to Sin-shumu-lishir's attempt.' He was the only eunuch to ever claim the throne of Assyria.' It is possible that a set of undated seal impressions from Nineveh containing the image of a beardless king could depict Sin-shumu-lishir, as Assyrian kings were always depicted with beards but eunuchs were always depicted beardless.' Seeking to seize power for himself, Sin-shumu-lishir quickly took some key cities in northern Babylonia, including Nippur and Babylon itself. Though his area of control was limited to parts of Babylonia, Sin-shumu-lishir only claimed the title \\"King of Assyria\\", not \\"King of Babylon\\". Sin-shumu-lishir never successfully took control of the Assyrian Empire and his tenure as \\"king\\" in Nippur and Babylon lasted only three months before Sinsharishkun successfully defeated him. In a later Babylonian epic, the killing of Sin- shumu-lishir, in the story called the \\"almighty commander of the eunuchs\\", is attributed to Nabopolassar (the first king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire), rather than Sinsharishkun.'''' Despite being a usurper and not successfully taking control of the Assyrian heartland, Sin-shumu-lishir is routinely listed in modern historiography as one of the final Assyrian kings, together with the legitimate rulers Ashur-etil-ilani and Sinsharishkun.''''

A small dielectric particle (20 nm to several micrometres) is held by a strongly focused laser beam. The forward scattered light, i.e. the light whose orientation is slightly changed while passing through the particle, and unscattered light are collected by a lens and projected onto a Quadrant Photo- Diode (QPD), i.e. a Position sensitive device (PSD). These two components interfere in the detector and produce signals, which permit the detection of the bead's position in three dimensions. The precision is very good (as low as 0.1 nm) and the recording speed is very high (up to 1 MHz). Brownian motion deflects the bead from the resting position. A time sequence of measured positions allows one to derive the optical potential in which the particle is held. The PFM is sensitive to the environment of the particle and has been used in a variety of different experiments that e.g. monitor space that can be filled by particles inside agarose or the fate of small latex beads captured by macrophages. A similar concept of scanning a bead with an optical trap over a surface was invented in 1993 by Ghislain and W. W. Webb. The name of photonic force microscope was first used in 1997 by Ernst-Ludwig Florin, Arnd Pralle, J. Heinrich Hoerber and Ernst H.K. Stelzer during their stays at EMBL, when they developed 3D position detection and began using the Brownian motion as scanner.

Location and description Walpole lies very close to the northern point of the Walpole Inlet, from which it takes its name. The inlet in turn is named for the Walpole River, discovered in 1831 by Captain Thomas Bannister, and named by Governor Stirling for Captain W. Walpole, with whom he had served aboard HMS Warspite in 1808. The first European settlers to arrive in the area were Pierre Bellanger and his family in 1909. They travelled aboard the Grace Darling from Albany to take up of land. Land in the Walpole area was reserved for a national park in 1910, and the area subsequently became a popular holiday destination. Major development began to occur in the 1930s as part of the land settlement scheme. The railway reached Nornalup in 1929, and the Walpole town site was gazetted in 1933. Name Walpole was always the preferred name, but it was believed this was already in use in Tasmania. So the newly gazetted township was officially named Nornalup, but this caused confusion with the railway terminus east. Eventually the Post Office advised that there was no Walpole in Tasmania, and in 1934 the town reverted to its original name of Walpole. Walpole is one of the few towns through which the Bibbulmun Track passes. The area is famous for the giant tingle and karri trees of old growth forest.

The castle has been neglected and has fallen into disrepair; due to its condition, the building is not open to the public, and since 2008 has been listed on the Buildings at Risk Register.Elvaston Castle Country Park - official Derbyshire County Council siteElvastonCastle.org.uk - Information about Elvaston Castle, Derbyshire Derbyshire County Council estimates the castle and estate requires at least ¬£6.1 million of work and materials in essential repairs, with a maximum permitted overspend of 7% greater if it is decided to re-open the building to the public or sell it in repaired form.http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/11-05-06%20Elvaston%20Vol%201%20Intro%20and%20Exec%20Summary_tcm44-174384.pdf History Elvaston Castle today Until the 16th century the estate was held by the Shelford Priory. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the Crown sold the priory and its estates in 1538 to Sir Michael Stanhope of Rampton, Nottinghamshire. Sir John Stanhope (died 1611) granted the estate to his second son, also Sir John Stanhope (d .1638), High Sheriff of Derbyshire, in 1629. The manor house was built for the latter Sir John in 1633. This Elizabethan-style house was redesigned and extended in a grand Gothic Revival style by James Wyatt in the early 19th century for the Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl of Harrington. Wyatt designed a new wing, a new great hall, and most of the interiors of the castle, but died before work was completed. His designs were carried out by Robert Walker between 1815 and 1829. Further modifications were made in the 1836 by the architect Lewis Nockalls Cottingham; this work was on the Elizabethan-styled south front which was remodelled to match the rest of the now Gothic-styled castle. This was the final modification and created the castle we see today. During World War II, the house was turned into a teacher training college after the original college in Derby was evacuated. The college vacated the house in 1947, after which time it remained mostly empty for the next two decades until its sale, starting a steady decline that continues to this day. =The Gardens= Derby Museum The 3rd Earl, approached Humphry Repton to remodel the grounds of the Castle, however, Repton turned down the commission due to the flatness of the estate, which he found daunting. In 1830, Charles Stanhope, 4th Earl of Harrington commissioned the previously untried landscape gardener William Barron, to redesign the gardens. The Fourth Earl caused scandal by marrying an actress 17 years his junior: Maria Foote. Maria and Charles are described as \\"inseparable and besotted\\"; the Earl wanted the gardens to be a \\"private and secluded oasis of great beauty\\" for himself and the love of his life. Barron would spend the next 20 years working on the gardens; he even brought in full-grown trees to try to give instant gratification to the Earl. The Fourth Earl and his Countess valued their garden for the romantic seclusion it afforded them, however following the death of their only son aged 4, the couple isolated themselves at the castle, never leaving and forbidding anyone from entering the grounds. (Some sources claim it was the Earl that instigated the seclusion and forbade his wife from leaving)Derby Ghosts and Paranormal - Elvaston Castle Ghosts Ghosts Following the Fourth Earl's death in 1851, his brother, Leicester Stanhope, 5th Earl of Harrington, opened the gardens to the public. They became renowned as \\"a Gothic paradise\\", and are Grade II Listed. The estate contains over 50 structures, including stables, kennels, a walled garden, a home farm, several cottages, gatelodges, an ice house and a boathouse. The gardens are listed Grade II* on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Country park Following the Countryside Act 1968, the estate was sold in 1969 by William Stanhope, 11th Earl of Harrington to Derbyshire County Council. The Countryside Act proposed the creation of \\"country parks\\", \\"for the enjoyment of the countryside by the public\\". The council opened the estate to the public in 1970 and have operated it since then, as Elvaston Castle Country Park. In 1969, Elvaston was also used as a location for Ken Russell's film adaptation of the D.H. Lawrence novel Women in Love. Today The castle today The country park is threatened with closure.Friends Of Elvaston Castle The deterioration of the castle and estate which started after World War II continued under the care of Derbyshire County Council; by 1990 the castle was considered unsafe and was closed to visitors. Derbyshire County Council claims that it cannot afford to repair and maintain the building and country park; in the year 2000, the council estimated the country park's running costs were ¬£500,000 a year, and that they were facing a backlog of restoration work which would cost them ¬£3,000,000. Since 2000, the council has been marketing the estate for sale to private companies. The latest of these is an attempt to turn the Castle into an hotel and the Park into golf courses. This is being fiercely contested by \\"The Friends of Elvaston Castle\\" on behalf of the local community. The ¬£3,000,000 repair work needed in 2000 was not performed; the continued lack of funding from the county council has led to much of the country park and estate to fall into disrepair. The castle is in need of considerable restoration and is not open to the public; since 2008 has been listed on the Buildings at Risk Register. Derbyshire County Council acknowledges the \\"ever increasing backlog of maintenance and outstanding repair work\\". The cost of repair work has spiraled and as of November 2010, the council estimates the castle needs ¬£6.422 million of work and materials in essential repairs (This figure includes a 7.5% contingency but does not include non-essential repairs, decoration or furnishing).Elvaston repairs: Leisure and culture - Derbyshire County Council =Hauntings= The castle is thought by some to be haunted: various professional investigations have been conducted in the castle, with phenomena being reported including unexplained noises, unexplained apparitions, people being pushed and things being moved. The ghosts are alleged to include a maid and 'a strong woman'. The castle is also supposed to be the haunt of two ghosts known as The Grey Lady, and The White Lady.

The rear of the tank has been blown away, making it irreparable. A catastrophic kill, K-Kill or complete kill is damage inflicted on an armored vehicle that amounts to complete destruction of the vehicle, rendering it both permanently non-functional and irreparable. The term knocked out refers to a vehicle which has been damaged to the point of inoperability and abandoned by its crew, but is not obviously beyond the point of repair. While a knocked-out vehicle may be later determined to be irreparable and written off, a K-kill is more obvious and usually involves the destruction of the vehicle by fire and/or explosion. Among tank crewmen it is also commonly known as a brew up, coined from the British World War II term for lighting a fire in order to brew tea. The expression arose because British troops used an old petrol tin with holes punched in the side as a makeshift stove on which to brew their tea. The flames licking out of the holes in the side of the tin resembled a burning tank and thus the expression was coined. Typically a catastrophic kill results in the ignition of any fuel the vehicle may be carrying as well as the detonation (cooking off, or sympathetic detonation) of its ammunition. A catastrophic kill does not necessarily preclude the survival of the vehicle's crew, although most historical casualties in armored warfare were the result of K-kills. This type of kill is also associated with the jack-in-the-box effect, where a tank's turret is blown skyward due to the overpressure of an ammunition explosion. Some tank designs employ blow-off panels, channeling such explosions outside of the vehicle, turning an otherwise catastrophic kill into a firepower kill.
