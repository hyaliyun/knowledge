Set in the 1950s and 1960s, the storyline follows the lives of 12 characters living in a small Irish town, in chapters with interlocking plot elements. The novel was recorded as a BBC audiobook in 2007. Plot The novel follows the lives of 12 different young people in the small Irish town of Shancarrig, most of them graduates of the stone schoolhouse on the hill where they engraved their initials on a large copper beech tree. Each chapter is told from the viewpoint of one of the characters, although the plot details often reappear in other chapters. Maura Brennan has no choice but to work after her schooling. She has a drunken father and so is happy to work as a live-in chamber maid in Ryan's hotel. Nessa's mother prefers that her daughter does not speak with Maura even though they went to the same school. Maura falls in love with the barman Gerry O'Sullivan and becomes pregnant. They marry, but the child is born with Down syndrome and Gerry abandons Maura to face it alone. She then works for the Darcys who have opened a new shop in the village. She solves the mystery of Gloria's missing jewels and ends up owning them. Leo Murphy is the last child still at home. She lives with her injured soldier father and mother. Her teenage life is caught in the tangle her mother has made and she thinks she can never be normal again. She finds love, which helps her to break down the walls she made for herself. Foxy Dunne from the slums never gives up. He works his way up in life and becomes a builder. He helps Leo forget her miseries and leave them behind. Eddie Barton lives with his seamstress mother. He writes to his pen friend in Scotland, and eventually it turns into love. Both of them are worried about their appearances and don't know if they will be accepted by the other. The pen friend comes down to Shancarrig and gives a new lease of life to Eddie and his mother. Nessa Ryan thinks her mother is bossy, and she grows up to be a person of strong character, choosing the right man for her life. Niall Hayes doesn't know how to get what he wants in life. His cousin Richard takes everything Niall desires: a place in his father's solicitor's firm and the girl he loves. How he gets all this is the crux of his story. Jim and Nora Kelly, the school master and mistress, are dedicated to teaching the children despite their own infertility. Nora's twin sister Helen returns home to visit with her four-year-old daughter, Maria, and is killed in a freak road accident, leaving the Kellys to care for the child and hope that she can remain with them. Other characters include Maddy Ross, Father Brian Barry, Michael and Gloria Darcy, Dr. Jims Blake and his son Declan, and Father Gunn and his housekeeper Mrs. Kennedy. The novel ends with the sale of the schoolhouse, with many of the main characters showing an interest in purchasing it. Themes The novel follows a changing Irish society in the 1950s and 1960s. Social barriers that divided families for generations begin to fall, as for example a boy from the lowest socioeconomic class ends up marrying the daughter of an army major. Numerous female characters are also depicted as \\"strong, independent women of the 1950s [who have] no time for silly romances\\". Audiobook The novel was recorded as a BBC audiobook in 2007.

He died at 09:30 am (90 minutes before the armistice came into effect), shot by a sniper while on a patrol in woodland on the outskirts of Mons, Belgium. Biography Ellison was born in York and later lived in Leeds, England. He first joined the British Army as a regular soldier in 1902 - but had left by 1912, by which time he had become a coal miner, and when he married Hannah Maria Burgan in Nottingham. Sometime just before the outbreak of war he was recalled to the army, joining the 5th Royal Irish Lancers and serving in the army from the very start of the war. He fought in the Battle of Mons in 1914, and several other battles including the Battle of Ypres, Battle of Armenti√®res, Battle of La Bass√©e, Battle of Lens, Battle of Loos, and Battle of Cambrai on the Western Front. Ellison, aged 40 at the time of his death, is buried in the St Symphorien Military Cemetery, just southeast of Mons. Coincidentally, and in large part due to Mons being lost in the very opening stages of the war and regained at the very end (from the British perspective), his grave faces that of John Parr, the first British soldier killed during the Great War, and just a few metres away from George Lawrence Price, the Canadian soldier who was also felled near Mons at 10:58am, and was the last British Empire soldier killed in the Great War. He was survived by Hannah and a son, James Cornelius (just five days short of his fifth birthday when his father was killed) ‚Äì living in Richmond Hill in east Leeds, as were Ellison's parents. The family only learnt of his death just before Christmas, more than a month after the war had ended. Ellison's only brother Frederick was also killed during the war, in 1917. In recent times, Ellison's story was featured in a 2008 BBC 'Timewatch' documentary with Michael Palin, in conjunction with his granddaughters. Then in 2018, he and John Parr became the inspiration behind a poem, \\"Goodnight Kiss\\", by writer Philip Parker - written as part of a project in conjunction with the Imperial War Museums. And in November 2018 (the centenary of his death at the very end of the war), Leeds Civic Trust and partners unveiled a memorial plaque to him at Leeds railway station (pictured below), paid for via a public crowdfunding campaign. The Civic Trust‚Äôs plaques are usually blue, but Ellison‚Äôs is olive green to symbolise the uniform of the soldiers. The unveiling event, on 7 November, garnered considerable media coverage, and was attended by his two granddaughters and other family members. A memorial mock newspaper was created and circulated at the event, marking Ellison's life and the story of the war as experienced by regular people in Leeds. Following the unveiling of the plaque, Leeds artist Suman Kaur heard Ellison's story, and created and circulated a 'remastered' charcoal portrait of him based on the only known photo of him. Note that various websites (one of which is featured in the footnote below) still incorrectly feature a different and much clearer portrait - but this has been proven to be someone else completely.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and is a contributing property to the Central Troy Historic District created in 1986. Since the 1950s it, and the Carr Building next door, has been the main office of the Rensselaer County Historical Society, The house is open to the public as a historic house museum. Built in 1827 from a most likely created by architect Martin E. Thompson, of New York City, it is a Federal style townhouse with decorated marble and limestone facing considered one of the best and most intact houses in that style in the city of Troy. The house was built by John Bard Colgrove, who moved to Troy, NY in 1826 to oversee the construction of the Hart House. Immediately after constructing the Hart House, Colgrove built the first Rensselaer County Court House (1828‚Äì31). It was constructed as a gift for his only child, Betsey Howard Hart, and her husband, Richard P. Hart, by wealthy New York City merchant and banker William Howard, done in a style similar to contemporary mansions there. Those homes have since been demolished, making Troy the only extant place visitors can experience an early 19th-century New York City mansion. In the late 19th century it became the property of another local businessman, George Cluett, who expanded it in the early 20th century. In 1910, the property was sold to his nephew Albert Cluett and his wife Caroline. Caroline Cluett donated the house to the Historical Society in 1952. Building The house is L-shaped, two and a half stories high with a full basement. The short end facing the street to its east and the long end wrapping around the brick house to its north. The front facade is four bays wide; the southern facade, accounting for the house's full depth from the street and overlooking a narrow alley, nine. All other facades save the front are done in brick. That front facade is dominated by its off- center entrance. The recessed door is set in a portico, with elliptical fanlight supported by small columns and sidelights. Around the portico are a marble architrave with vermiculated keystone and quoins. No similar marble houses, are found in Troy, or the vicinity. The marble is presumed to come from a Berkshire quarry, possibly near Great Barrington, Mass. The marble has vertical comb finish, approximately 6 to the inch and is laid with 1/8\\" lime mortar joints.Historic American Buildings Survey. Hanns Weber, Author The tin gabled roof has two dormer windows on the east side. Two chimneys apiece rise from the north and south ends. There is one outbuilding, a former carriage house, in the rear of the building. Inside, the house follows the standard Federal-style central hall plan, with high ceilings and narrow, tall windows. Much of the original furnishings and trim remain. The plaster and woodwork are unaltered, as are such details as a marble mantelpiece and dining room mirror. The original basement kitchen remains, along with a late 19th-century one on the first floor. History Hart, an early member of Troy's business elite, was a personal friend of Howard when he married Betsey. He had made his money first by supplying the Army during the War of 1812 and then in commerce from the Erie and Champlain canals. He later served as president of the Schenectady and Troy Railroad and several local philanthropies. He had a political career as well, serving as a state assemblyman and mayor of Troy. To build the house, 29-year-old John Colegrove was hired. He moved to Troy from New York in 1826 to supervise the job, and stayed there, going on to build many other notable buildings in the city. His obituary in 1860 referred to the mansion as his first major local accomplishment. RCHS logo The original house was just the square block. The house was first enlarged in 1836 when Richard Hart was Mayor of Troy. Richard Hart died in 1843. Betsey remained in the house till her death in 1886 and her daughter Sarah Wool Hart was the last Hart to live in the house. She died in 1892 and the house was then sold to George B. Cluett, founder of Cluett, Peabody & Co. Inc. makers of Arrow Shirts. George and his wife Amanda had a new addition built that moved the kitchen to the first floor, replacing the original basement kitchen. He sold the house to his nephew Albert E. Cluett, in 1910. Albert and Caroline Cluett made alterations on the third floor, raising the roof to accommodate the growing needs of their four sons. New oak floors, picture and chair rail mouldings all in the Colonial Revival Style were added to the two parlors and entrance hall. The old wallpaper was removed and the walls were painted ivory. A scenic wallpaper from the Zuber & Co. of Paris, France was installed on the walls of the Entrance Hall on the first floor. Albert Cluett died in 1949 but not before he and his wife Caroline challenged the Board of Trustees at RCHS to raise money to support the preservation of the house. Caroline lived in the house until 1952 when she then signed the house over to RCHS. The society has maintained it as a historic house museum and uses the adjoining Joseph B. Carr Building (57 2nd Street) as their museum headquarters that house the changing exhibition galleries, research library, collection storage and administrative offices. Museum The house is open to the public the 2nd Saturday of the month at 2pm for a guided tour, May through December.

Valencia was at the time unsettled by plague and flood, and the germanies (guilds) were taking control of the city of Valencia from the weak royal government there. Mendoza, a Castilian, was not well-received, and he provoked the Germanies by siding with the nobility and refusing to seat lawfully-elected representatives from the populace that favored the Germanies. The viceroy's palace was attacked, and only barely held out after two hours assault. Mendoza and the government fled into the countryside, and the open warfare phase of the Revolt of the Brotherhoods began. Mendoza was initially defeated by the agermanats at the Battle of Gandia in June 1521, but royalist troops triumphed elsewhere, and he eventually returned with reinforcements into the city of Valencia in November 1521. He acted with moderation against the defeated rebels, but the arrival in 1523 of the new Viceroy Germaine of Foix, widow of Ferdinand of Aragon, saw the punishment of the rebels intensify. Diego was married to Ana de la Cerda y Castro, granddaughter of Gast√≥n de la Cerda, 4th Count of Medinaceli. He died in Toledo in 1536.

The Porto Alegre Botanical Garden is a Foundation of Rio Grande do Sul located on the street Salvador Fran√ßa, in Porto Alegre, Brazil. History Area of cactus Education at the Porto Alegre Botanical Garden The project for a botanical garden in Porto Alegre dates back to the beginning of the 19th century, when Dom Joao VI, after creating the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden, sent seedlings to Porto Alegre to establish another similar park in the city. Unfortunately these seedlings did not come to the capital, remaining trapped in Rio Grande, where they were planted. The agriculturist Paul Schoenwald subsequently donated a plot of land to the state government to establish a green area, but the project was unsuccessful. A third attempt would be made in 1882, when councilman Francisco Pinto de Souza presented a proposal for scientific exploitation of the area then known as the V√°rzea de Petr√≥polis, providing a garden and a promenade. Considered utopian, the plan was terminated and lay dormant for decades, only returning to consideration in the mid-20th century. In 1953 the 2136 law authorized the selling of an area of 81.57 hectares, of which 50 hectares would be to create a park or botanical garden. A committee, which included prominent teacher and religious figure Teodoro Lu√≠s, was formed to develop the project, which began in 1957 with the first planting of selected species: a collection of palm trees, conifers and succulent. When opened to the public on September 10, 1958, it already featured nearly 600 species. Soon after, in 1962, was inaugurated the oven for cacti, in the 1970s and the botanical garden was integrated into Funda√ß√£o Zoobot√¢nica Foundation, along with the Park Zoo and the Museum of Natural Sciences. This season began the collection of trees, with emphasis on families of ecological importance (Myrtaceae, Rutaceae, Myrsinaceae, Bignoniaceae, Fabales, Zingiberales, among others), thematic groups (condiments and scented) and forest formations typical of the state, and is launched a program for expeditions to collect specimens and seeds. A project linked to the Program Pro-Gua√≠ba allowed in the 1990s an improvement in the infrastructure of the Botanical Garden, where nurseries were built for bromeliads, orchids, succulent, vines and cacti, and reforms have taken place in the center of visitors and the administration, beyond the creation of a seed bank. Paleontology  Lawn At the Museum of Natural Sciences, which is located inside the Porto Alegre Botanical Garden, there is an exhibition of fossils found in geopark of paleorrota, as well as contributing to publications on the subject.

Chart of recorded occupations in Clopton in 1881. The outer ring represents men and the inner women. Graph of Clopton's population from 1801 to 2011, from available census records. Chart of Clopton's population structure, using data from the 2011 Census. Clopton is a village and civil parish in Suffolk. It is located between Ipswich and Debenham two kilometres north of Grundisburgh on the River Lark. The village is no larger than a series of houses either side of the B1078, surrounded by farm land. The village itself has no clear centre; houses and other buildings are concentrated around the four manors of Kingshall, Brendhall, Rousehall and Wascolies, all of which are mentioned in the Domesday Book. As of 2011, the population of the parish numbered 375 people. The village previously had a school, which was built in 1875 and had capacity for 100 pupils with an average attendance of 56, however it closed in the late 1930s. Pupils instead attend schools in Grundisburgh or Woodbridge, with a bus service provided by Suffolk County Council. History =Historical Writings= The earliest known mention of Clopton is a record in the Domesday Book as \\"Clopetuna\\". In the early 1870s, it was described in John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales as: : \\"...a parish in Woodbridge district, Suffolk; 3¬Ω miles N by W of Bealings r. station, and 4 NW of Woodbridge. Post town, Grundisburgh, under Wood-bridge. Acres, 2, 074. Real property, ¬£4, 012. Pop., 407. Houses, 84. The property is divided among a few. Part of the land is common. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Norwich. Value, ¬£720.* Patron, Mrs. E. Taylor. The church is old but good; and there are charities ¬£34.\\" In 1887, John Bartholomew also wrote an entry on Clopton in the Gazetteer of the British Isles with a much shorter description: :\\"Clopton, par., E. Suffolk, 4 miles NW. of Woodbridge, 2074 ac., pop. 382; P.O.; contains C. Hall.\\" The BBC Domesday Project described Clopton in a similar yet more detailed fashion to the Gazetteer entries in 1986: : \\"Clopton is a small village situated approximately 7 miles from Ipswich and 4 miles from Woodbridge in the county of Suffolk. The area consists mainly of arable farms together with a small amount of housing. To the east side of Clopton is an area of disused airfield which now has a small amount of light industry. To the west side is the East Suffolk College of Agriculture and Horticulture at Otley; again consisting mainly of farmland. The village is served by a Post Office, bus service, mobile tradesmen and has 3 churches. There are no schools or shops in Clopton.\\" =World War II= Between Clopton and the nearby village of Debach, the site of RAF Debach can be found, which was home to the USAAF 493d Bombardment Group over the course of World War II. A service memorial and the flag flown over the base can be found inside St. Mary's church at Clopton. =Industry= In 1831, the decennial census found that over three-quarters of Clopton's population worked in agriculture, with most of these being labourers employed by farmers. Other than this, the parish had a small number describing themselves as being employed in \\"retail and handicrafts,\\" and an even smaller number being \\"professionals\\" or \\"other.\\" In 1844, White's Directories for Suffolk listed 13 farmers, a shoemaker, blacksmith and wheelwright. The 1912 edition listed 19 farmers, a farm bailiff, postmaster, schoolmaster, builder, shoemaker, wheelwright, storekeeper, grocer, hardware merchant, furniture remover/carrier, publican and insurance agent. By 1881, the Parish as a whole, while still mostly reliant on agriculture to provide work, had diversified into other industries. Around this time, the presence of women in the workplace had increased somewhat as well: though these industries were small in comparison to the almost entirely male-dominated agricultural sector, in the 1881 census women outnumbered men in the 'Domestic Services and Offices' and 'Dress' occupation orders. Nonetheless, while 75 men reported working in agriculture, only 9 women reported having an occupation at all. =Population= Since the passing of the Census Act 1800, Clopton's overall population has remained relatively unchanged. In 1801, the first decennial census recorded a population of 389 people, while an all-time high of 468 was recorded in 1831. The Modern Parish The modern village of Clopton has been described as: : \\"...a widely spaced village which consists mainly of farming, around 140 residential homes and a few small businesses. There is a very good village hall at the centre of the village, which gets plenty of bookings... but, unfortunately, no village pub, nor shop. However, there are several of each in the nearby surrounding villages.\\" =Demographics= In 2011, the National Census found that 385 people lived in Clopton, and of these 186 were male and 189 female. The average age of people in Clopton is 41 years, though the largest age group is 45‚Äì59 years, with 83 people (22.1% of the total population) reported. =Employment= People in Clopton reported in the 2011 Census that they were primarily in full-time employment or self-employed (28.8% and 22.9% of the population, respectively), with a smaller percentage being in part-time employment (15.5%). Men make up more of these figures than women: While 35.7% and 32.9% of men are in full-time employment and self-employed respectively, these figures are only 21.4% and 12.2% for women. The principle sectors of employment for men, as found by the 2011 Census, are in \\"Skilled Trades Occupations\\" (25%), \\"Managers, Directors and Senior Officials\\" (23.1%) and \\"Professional Occupations\\" (21.3%). For women, the main sectors are \\"Professional Occupations\\" (20%), \\"Managers, Directors and Senior Officials\\" (17.6%) and \\"Administrative and Secretarial Occupations\\" (17.6%), with an additional notable presence in \\"Caring, Leisure and Other Service Occupations\\" (14.1%). =Local Politics= Clopton has joined a campaign dubbed \\"Save Our Rural Roads\\", first started in 1997 by Grundisburgh & Culpho Parish Council, after concerns of heavy goods vehicles causing damage to buildings and roads in the community. Residents of the village receive a quarterly news magazine from Grundisburgh and District News.

He also worked for the Chuck Fleischmann campaign in Tennessee's 3rd district from 2009 to 2010. Early life Saltsman was born in Nashville, Tennessee, to parents John Bruce Saltsman, Sr. and Edna Elaine Saltsman. He attended Father Ryan High School, a Catholic high school in Nashville, and then Christian Brothers University in Memphis, where he earned his bachelor's and master's in business administration degrees. While at Christian Brothers, Saltsman was active in the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, the Knights of Columbus and student government.Sullivan, Bartholomew, \\"CBUer running Huckabee campaign\\", The Memphis Commercial Appeal, February 4, 2008. Political career Interested in politics from an early age, Saltsman's first substantial campaign involvement was with President George H.W. Bush's re-election effort in 1992. In 1994, as the Republican Revolution swept Senators Bill Frist and Fred Thompson into office, Saltsman was active in then-West Tennessee Congressman Don Sundquist's successful run for governor. Saltsman continued to work his way up through the Tennessee party ranks, becoming Tennessee Republican Party chairman in 1998. Despite his service with Governor Sundquist, however, Saltsman strongly opposed Sundquist's plan to impose a state income tax for the first time in Tennessee history. The income tax plan eventually failed to become law due to strong grassroots opposition from conservatives across the state. Tennessee remains one of only nine states without a broad-based income tax. Under Saltsman's watch as state party chairman in 2000, then-Governor George W.

It was one of the Licensing Acts 1828 to 1886.The Short Titles Act 1896, section 2(1) and Schedule 2 It required the closure of all public houses in Wales on Sundays. The Act had considerable political importance as a formal acknowledgement of the separate character of Wales, setting a precedent for future legislation and decisions. It was repealed in 1961.  Introduction of the legislation  The legislation was introduced by the Liberal Government elected in 1880 under Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone. It was the first Act since the union between England and Wales in 1535‚Äì1542 which specifically applied only to Wales.John Davies, A History of Wales, 1993, A similar Bill which would have applied in England was rejected by Parliament. The 1881 Act did not apply to Monmouthshire, but was extended over that county in 1915 under wartime legislation which was reaffirmed in 1921.Hansard 1921 However, later Acts which were specific to Wales, including the Welsh Intermediate Education Act 1889 and the Welsh Cemeteries Act 1908, were also applied to Monmouthshire. Welcome to Monmouthshire ‚Äì \\"interesting points\\"  Background and effects  The legislation followed pressure by the temperance movement and, in particular, the nonconformist chapels. According to historian John Davies, the public houses in Wales had become \\"recruiting centres for the Conservative Party\\" following earlier Liberal legislation to restrict the licensed trade, and there was considerable backing among Welsh working class men to restrict their opening. However, one of the effects of the legislation was to encourage the opening of a large number of private social clubs which were excluded from it, and the legislation seems to have had little effect on drunkenness. BBC Wales ‚Äî Industrialisation and temperance According to Davies, \\"above all, [the legislation] connected Welshness with negativity\\", and it became increasingly unpopular through the 20th century.

Hidden and his party of 14 dragoons encountered an estimated 150 Confederate soldiers. Although vastly outnumbered, Hidden ordered a charge. In the resulting skirmish, he was shot in the neck and died soon afterward. The rest of the scouting party was wounded or captured. Hidden was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

Gheewala halwa is popular for sohan halwa since the Mughal era. There are hundreds of shops that produce sohan halwa in the cities of Multan (Punjab) and Dera Ismail Khan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). It is made by boiling a mixture of water, sugar, milk, and cornflour until it becomes solid. Saffron is used for flavoring. Ghee is used to prevent it from sticking to the pan. Almonds, pistachios, and cardamom seeds are added. Unlike most other halwa dishes in the Indian subcontinent, it is solid, similar to its Middle Eastern counterparts. History Sohan Halwa (top shelf) and other traditional Indian sweets. The Hafiz Halwa shop in Multan claims it was introduced by Dewan Sawan Mal, the ruler of Multan in 1750. However, there is a theory that it was invented in Persia by Iranian people and it was considered an ancient sweet served during social gatherings. S. Abdul Khaliq claims that this halwa was introduced in the Indian subcontinent in the early 16th century when Mughal emperor Humayun (r. 1530‚Äì1540, 1555‚Äì1556) came back to power in Medieval India after being exiled in Herat, which was the capital of Persia. In Old Delhi, the 225-year-old Ghantewala sweet shop established during the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II, (r. 1759 - 1806) in 1790, made Sohan Halwa, and remained a popular visitors attraction,The royal treat in Chandni Chowk The Hindu, Nov 07, 2002. till its closure due to a lack of profitability hit the news July 23, 2015.

It was the side project of Aiden's William Francis before Aiden's hiatus, and he later operated as William Control full-time. 'William Control' therefore refers to both the band as a whole and to Francis as his stage name. Francis was signed to Victory Records before starting his own independent label Control Records, and, as William Control, has released five full-length albums (Hate Culture, Noir, Silentium Amoris, The Neuromancer and Revelations (split into four separate EPs)), an EP (Novus Ordo Seclorum), two acoustic albums (Skeleton Strings and Skeleton Strings 2), two live DVDs (Live in London Town and Babylon) and a remix album (Remix). The first part of Revelations, The Pale, was released on October 14, 2016. The second EP The Black followed on February 17, 2017, and the third, entitled The Red, followed that with a release date of July 14 of the same year. The album was completed by The White on November 24. As of The Neuromancer Francis referred to his band as 'The Neuromantic Boys', and the 'Boys' most recently consisted of Kenneth Fletcher (who has been a part of the William Control project since Hate Culture) and Ian MacWilliams, with Crilly Ashes standing in for Fletcher for some of 2017's live shows. Control announced his retirement from music/touring in October 2017, stating that he was going to concentrate on his clothing businesses and Control Records. In June 2018, Control temporarily ceased work due to accusations of sexual assault and the formation of a \\"sex cult\\" with groupies. History =2008= William Control's debut album, Hate Culture, was released in 2008, and is, according to a Kerrang! magazine interview, the story of a character named William Control and his last night on earth before he kills himself. Hate Culture peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Electronic Albums chart and No. 43 on the Heatseekers chart. The band released a video for Beautiful Loser, the album's only single, and then toured with Escape The Fate on their This War Is Ours Tour in late 2008. Their live debut was at Revolution in The Bronx, New York City, on September 26, 2008. =2009-2010= In 2009, Control began working on a new William Control album, Noir, which eventually surfaced on June 8, 2010. He invited friends (including Ash Costello of Orange County rock band New Years Day and Jeffree Star) and fans to come up to the studio and record vocals for part of the album. While it did not appear on Noir, a teaser video for the song \\"Deathclub\\" (a song that has only been released as a remix and has yet to be heard in its original form) was released on Control's social networking sites. The original track is actually an outtake from the Hate Culture sessions. The sole single from Noir was \\"I'm Only Human Sometimes\\" Later in 2010 Control released a series of spoken word tracks through iTunes, all works by Edgar Allan Poe. These were \\"Eleonora\\" (July 13), \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\" (September 13), \\"The Oval Portrait\\" (October 15), and \\"The Raven\\" (October 30). The band supported Black Veil Brides on their Entertainment Or Death Tour. Shortly after the release of Noir, Control left Victory Records, and founded his own record company, Control Records, based near Seattle, Washington. He now records all his music under this label. =2011= On November 29, 2011 a new five-track EP entitled Novus Ordo Seclorum was released. The physical copies came with a bonus track, a cover of \\"1963\\" by New Order. On the same day Control published a second book, Prose + Poems, having previously published Flowers & Filth with Lisa Johnson. =2012= Early 2012 saw an announcement that the band's third full-length album would be released on April 2, 2012, and be called Silentium Amoris. The band performed on the Fight To Unite US Tour, with Brokencyde and Blood on the Dance Floor in April and May 2012. In June 2012, William Control headlined their own New Faith Tour, playing shows in the UK, the Netherlands, and France. During this tour, they also headlined the Red Bull stage at Donington's Download Festival. A music video for the only single from Silentium Amoris, \\"Kiss Me Judas\\", was released on June 26, 2012 on YouTube. In August and September 2012, William Control filmed their debut live DVD, Live In London Town, directed by Tim Bullock and produced by A Glass Half. The film features a live show, shot at the O2 Academy Islington, as well as behind-the-scenes footage and interviews from two other dates. The twenty-track DVD was released in January 2013, with a new and previously unreleased 21st track, \\"Speak To Me Of Abduction\\", over the closing credits. October and November 2012 saw the band supporting The Birthday Massacre on their American tour, alongside Aesthetic Perfection. =2013= William Control appeared as special guest on The Church Of The Wild Ones US Tour with Black Veil Brides in early 2013. Control also starred in the film Legion of the Black, a movie based on the Black Veil Brides album Wretched and Divine. February saw Control making an appearance on the Kerrang! Tour 2013, performing a brief DJ set each night. In March 2013, Control released Skeleton Strings, his first acoustic album. Download only, it is a mixture of his own tracks and cover versions. Fans received it for a donation towards the costs of building his new studio and recording what became The Neuromancer. Artists covered included HIM, Placebo, Morrissey and The Smiths. March also saw the appearance of a video for \\"The Velvet Warms And Binds\\", off Silentium Amoris. In November, William Control headlined the Friday night at Whitby Goth Weekend, after playing a support slot at the festival in April. On October 1, 2013 Control announced that the next studio album would be called The Neuromancer, and that it was slated for release in early December 2013, just before the start of the US Revel Without A Cause Tour. Additionally, Control announced that his book Revelator Book One: The Neuromancer would be shipped earlier than expected and likely within the first two weeks of the month.

It is now available in paperback and digital form. =2014= The Neuromancer was finally released April 4, 2014. There were two singles from the album, \\"Revelator\\" and \\"Price We Pay\\", although the album itself was preceded on March 23 by a lyric video for Illuminator. In spring 2014, and again from October‚ÄìDecember 2014, William Control supported the aggrotech band Combichrist on both the American and European legs of their We Love You Tour. In April 2014, whilst on this tour, the band recorded a live DVD at Bar Sinister in Hollywood.

It was around this time that the new William Control velvet rose logo was launched, inspired by lyrics from Adore (Fall In Love Forever), off The Neuromancer. It has appeared in various forms on releases and merchandise since then. Velvet Rose William Control.jpg An album of remixes of William Control tracks (Remix) was also made available, as a free download through NoiseTrade. =2015= At the start of 2015, Francis announced that he was starting his own screen-printing business, Control Merch, to give him creative freedom over his own merchandise. This was initially in a rented studio, but in early 2016 he purchased his own shop, allowing for expansion of the business. He also launched the brand Submit Clothing. The Punishment Tour part 2 took place in April 2015 (UK) and May‚ÄìJune 2015 (US). Support came from Ashestoangels in the UK and Requiem and Justin Symbol in the US. The band once again performed at Whitby Goth Weekend, this time on the Sunday night, playing before The Damned. The band did one final 2015 live show at Toronto's Aftermath Festival in August 2015. =2016= Francis began teasing fans with snippets of new music from the fifth studio album in video clips on Instagram and Facebook. He worked on the album with Kenneth Fletcher and Axel Otero of Lay Your Ghost at his home studio in spring and summer of 2016. He embarked on a solo five-date acoustic tour of the UK (The Skeleton Strings Tour) in July 2016, supported by Crilly of Ashestoangels, and the full band returned to the UK in September 2016 for the ten-date Synths And Sinners Tour. \\"The Monster\\", the first single from the band's The Pale EP (the first of four that make up the album Revelations), was released as a YouTube video on September 5. Pre- orders for the EP through the Control Merch site began on September 22, with iTunes pre-orders starting the following day. Several US dates for October and November 2016 were then announced, after the planned full US tour fell through, including a performance on JBTV. The Pale, completed by tracks \\"Confess\\", \\"When The Love Is Pain\\" and \\"Mother Superior\\", received its full release on October 14, 2016. A video for \\"Confess\\", filmed by Fletcher in Edinburgh, Scotland whilst on the Synths And Sinners Tour, followed on October 26, as did a video for \\"When The Love Is Pain\\" on November 12. The Pale hit number one on both the Billboard Dance/Electronic album chart and the Heatseekers album chart. In spring 2016 it was revealed that a trilogy of films was to be made from the three Revelator books. In November 2016, posts appeared on Control's social media accounts about the third book in the Revelator trilogy, Revelator Book Three: The Hell Of Heaven. Pre-orders for the first edition went on sale on December 2, and sold out within a day. In December, Francis announced the formation of his own street team, The Neuromantics, named after 'The Neuromantic Movement', a term he has coined himself. He also applied for a trademark on Submit Clothing; this was confirmed in January 2018. =2017= The video for \\"Mother Superior\\", the final track on The Pale, was shot in Seattle and released on January 25, 2017. The band then played several American headline shows under the Synths & Sinners Tour title, before embarking on Andy Black of Black Veil Brides's Homecoming: The Curtain Call Tour as the main support act. This covered parts of both the United States and Canada, and continued from early February into March, finishing in Pomona, California on March 3. The video for the first track on Revelations: The Black EP, \\"Analog Flesh In A Digital World\\", was released on February 10, 2017, and the EP followed on February 17. Pre-orders for the latter began through the Control Merch site on February 5. The Black hit number 6 on the Billboard Top Dance/Electronic album chart and number one on the Heatseekers album chart. A video for the track \\"Knife Play\\" was released on April 1, 2017, and one for \\"All I Need\\" followed on May 13. In April 2017, the band completed a European tour supporting Aesthetic Perfection, with Crilly Ashes standing in for Kenneth Fletcher on keyboards. June, July and August saw them playing across the US on Warped 2017, again with Crilly Ashes. As part of this, Control also ran a daily TEI workshop on DIY in the music business. He also made an appearance at the APMAs, presenting the band New Years Day. An \\"Introduction to Control Records\\" video was posted on YouTube on June 29. A Control Records sampler CD was handed out at Warped, and also made available for digital download. It includes a William Control cover of \\"Running Up That Hill\\" Kate Bush and \\"The Night Is Ours\\" by The Neuromantic Boys. The other artists featured are Black Blinds, Lay Your Ghost and The Secret Post. Pre-orders for the third installment in the Revelations series, The Red, began through the Control Merch website (as well as on digital channels such as iTunes, Amazon and Spotify) on June 30, with the EP being released on July 14. It reached number 5 on the Billboard Dance/Electronic album chart and number one on the Heatseekers album chart. A video for \\"Let Her Go\\" was released on September 6, 2017. A limited-edition signed hardcover book containing all three Revelator novels was also published. In October, the band embarked upon the Graveyard Shift Tour, opening for Motionless In White. However, they left the tour before it finished, with Francis announcing his retirement from touring/music to concentrate on his clothing businesses and Control Records. This was after a wave of allegations went viral online, after multiple women accused William on incorrect BDSM practices, manipulation, coercive control and grooming. He did still promise the final installment of Revelations, in the form of The White. A lyric video for the track \\"Ghost\\" was published on November 13, but it proved to be the only video for this final EP. The White was released on November 24. Guest vocalists included Axel Otero of Lay Your Ghost, Lvci (both signed to Control Records), and Crilly Ashes. This EP hit the top spot on the Billboard Dance/Electronic album and the Heatseekers album charts. = 2018 = On June 4, 2018, Francis announced the forthcoming release of a full Revelations LP that would combine all of the previous EP songs into a single album, along with two new songs. However, controversy occurred when Control faced more accusations of creating a \\"sex cult\\" that included sexual abuse, date rape, extortion, grooming underage girls, and the tattooing of his name and initials on girls' genitalia as a form of \\"branding\\". Faced with the accusations, on June 8 Control announced a cancellation of the album's release and the closure of Control Records to avoid affecting any other artists on the label. Several artists who had recently been signed to Control Records announced their departure in the wake of the accusations, with Daniel Graves of Aesthetic Perfection announcing that he would be re-releasing his collaboration \\"Rhythm + Control\\" with Control's vocals removed and 100 percent of the proceeds for the first 6 months donated to Planned Parenthood. The complete Revelations LP was released on June 22, 2018. On October 11, 2018, Control released a music video for \\"All The Love\\", which had been featured on the album. The track was noted by his prior accusers to contain lyrics that suggested it was meant to taunt them and encourage them to commit suicide. On December 22, 2018, Control released an advertisement for a re-release of Hate Culture. = 2019 = Beginning on March 15, 2019, Control released a series of videos on YouTube confronting his accusations and presenting his side of the story and personal evidence.

Created by Arthur Rankin, Jr. and his partner Jules Bass, it was based on the 1883 book The Adventures of Pinocchio written by Italian author, Carlo Collodi. The series was Rankin/Bass' first production to be made in \\"Animagic\\", a stop motion puppet technique which, in association with the company, was done by Tadahito Mochinaga's MOM Productions. A total of 130 five-minute \\"chapters\\" were produced in 1960‚Äì61. These segments made up a series of five-chapter, 25-minute episodes. The show was deliberately designed to not emulate Walt Disney Animation Studios' popular 1940 version of Pinocchio in character design or characterization; the puppet wore a T-shirt and shorts instead of a Tyrolean hat, the Cricket (not Jiminy Cricket) had a high-pitched, grating voice, and Gepetto was calm and deliberate, unlike Disney's excitable and absent-minded woodcarver. During 1963‚Äì64, the series was also aired in Japan on Fuji TV as part of another stop motion TV series, Prince Ciscorn („Ç∑„Çπ„Ç≥„É≥ÁéãÂ≠ê, lit. Ciscorn ≈åji), based on the manga by Fujiko Fujio and also produced by Tadahito Mochinaga for Studio KAI and Dentsu. In 1980, twenty years later, Rankin/Bass produced another stop motion adaptation of the novel for television, a Christmas special called Pinocchio's Christmas. Summary An old wood carver Geppetto narrates the series, explaining on how he made a magically living puppet named Pinocchio, who can walk, jump, run and do other things without strings. In addition, he is also known to have his nose grow whenever he tell lies on anything be it right or wrong. Displeased with the need to continue living as a puppet, Pinocchio sets off on a journey with his friend Cricket to find the Blue Fairy, hoping that she can transform him into a real boy (in other words, a human) with her magic. But along the way, Pinocchio and Cricket encounter the two anthropomorphic animal cons, Foxy Q. Fibble and Cool S. Cat, as well as the greatest adventures, mishaps, danger and excitement than they would ever imagine. Character voices *Stan Francis - Geppetto *Larry D. Mann - Foxy Q. Fibble *Paul Kligman - Cool S.

The company is widely known for its sculptures and dinnerware although the company made many other products including figurines, trivets, and vases. All Frankoma pottery is made in the U.S. from locally dug clay. History Frankoma was founded by John Frank in Norman, Oklahoma, in 1933. Frank had been a professor in ceramics at the University of Oklahoma at Norman from 1927 to 1936 and used light-hued local Ada clay in his initial products. He moved the company to Sapulpa in 1938, only to soon rebuild that factory after a fire later that year. The name Frankoma was created from Frank's last name and the last three letters of the state of Oklahoma. The light Ada clay was replaced by brick-red local clay in 1953. John Frank operated the pottery with his wife Grace Lee Frank until his death in 1973. The factory was rebuilt in 1984 after a September 1983 fire destroyed most of the facility; the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1990. The Frank's daughter Joniece ran the pottery until 1991 when she was forced to sell the struggling company; the purchaser, Richard Bernstein of Maryland, resold the business in 2005 to Det Merryman. The company was closed for six weeks and was sold again during the summer of 2008, reopening on August 18 with new owner Joe Ragosta. Ragosta planned to bring back all the employees and continue the Frankoma line of pottery. The year 2008 marked the company's 75-year anniversary. The company closed in 2010 and was auctioned on May 18, 2011. Over a thousand pieces of pottery plus showroom fixtures and equipment were sold. The 1,800 original molds and the Frankoma name were not included in the sale. The real estate also was not part of the auction. In August 2012, the factory building was sold to a non-pottery manufacturer. Also in that month, the original Frankoma molds and trademark name were sold to a limited liability company called FPC LLC. As of April 2020, pottery continues to be made, but in lower volume quantities with artware being the primary focus. The University of Oklahoma's Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art opened an Oklahoma Clay: Frankoma Pottery exhibition in 2012, documenting Oklahoma culture through pottery.

Named Karstj√§ger (\\"Karst Hunter\\"), it was one of the 38 divisions fielded by the Waffen-SS. Formed on 18 July 1944 from the SS Volunteer Karstwehr Battalion, its nominal strength was never more than theoretical and the division was soon reduced to the Waffen Mountain (Karstj√§ger) Brigade of the SS. Throughout its existence as a battalion, division and brigade, it was primarily involved in fighting partisans in the Karst Plateau on the frontiers of Yugoslavia, Italy, and Austria; the mountainous terrain required specialised mountain troops and equipment. Founded in 1942 as a company, the unit consisted mainly of Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans/Austrians) from Yugoslavia and the South Tyrol province of Italy. Although focused on anti-partisan operations, it also saw action in the wake of the Italian surrender when it moved to disarm Italian troops in Tarvisio and protect ethnic German communities in Italy. In addition, at the end of the war it successfully fought to keep passes into Austria open, allowing German units to escape the Balkans and surrender to British forces. The remnants of the unit became some of the last Germans to lay down their arms when they surrendered to the British 6th Armoured Division on 9 May 1945. A joint Italian-German study implicated the division in 23 separate war crimes involving the killing of a total of 277 people between the Italian surrender and the end of the war. History The training centre for the SS- Freiwilligen-Karstwehr Battalion was located in alt=a black and white photograph of a building with a mountain behind it =Origins= In mid-1942, the Waffen-SS formed a company intended for anti-partisan operations in the rugged and high-altitude border region between Italy, Austria and Yugoslavia known as the Karst. SS-Standartenf√ºhrer (Colonel) Hans Brand, a geologist and speleologist, suggested the creation of the unit. The company was formed at the SS training centre in Dachau on 10 July 1942 from soldiers of the supply services training and replacement battalion of the 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian). It was expanded to battalion strength of around 500 troops in November 1942, and as the SS-Freiwilligen-Karstwehr Battalion, it spent the first six months of 1943 training in Austria. The unit drew its recruits mainly from among the Germans of Yugoslavia (Volksdeutsche) and South Tyrolians, with the officer cadre being drawn from SS geological detachments. The battalion-strength Waffen-SS Geological Corps (), from which such detachments were drawn, was formed in April 1941 and consisted mainly of engineers with a few geologists. They examined caves and natural obstacles, and determined whether off-road terrain was suitable for tanks. They were also responsible for locating sources of fresh water. Following the Armistice of Cassibile in September 1943, the battalion was tasked with disarming Italian troops around Tarvisio on the border between the three countries. It then moved on to protective duties for nearby Volksdeutsche communities. From October 1943 until June 1944, the battalion was based at Gradisca d'Isonzo in Italy, and participated in anti-partisan operations in the areas of Trieste, Udine and the Istrian peninsula. On 10 October, a column of the battalion was ambushed at the Predil Pass, suffering three killed and eight wounded. The following day the battalion burned down the village of Strmec and killed 16 local men in retaliation. Up to 19 October 1943, the battalion suffered a total of 18 killed and 45 wounded in a series of engagements near the village of Bovec (Flitsch). During the same period, the battalion captured two Italian 75 mm mountain guns, which significantly increased its firepower. During late October and November 1943, the battalion was engaged in anti-partisan operations around ≈Ωaga (Saga) and Kobarid (Karfreit), including Operation Traufe (Eaves). In late November, it was placed under the command of the Supreme SS and Police Leader, Italy, SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer und General der Waffen-SS (Lieutenant General) Karl Wolff for an operation. In February 1944, the battalion conducted Operation Ratte (Rat), during which it burned down the villages of Komen and Branik (Rihenberg), and interned the population of both villages in labour camps. Early in 1944, Brandt suggested that Slovene nationalists be recruited into the battalion, but the idea was rejected by SS headquarters who feared that such a policy would allow the infiltration of the unit by Yugoslav Partisans. At this stage, it was estimated that there were about 20,000 communist partisans operating in the Gorizia region. During March 1944, the battalion was involved in a rapid series of operations, including Zypresse (Cypress), M√§rzveilchen (Violet), Maulwurf (Mole) and Hellblau (Light Blue), resulting in significant guerrilla casualties, as well as executions of captured partisans. In March and April, Operation Osterglocke (Daffodil) was conducted over 12 days, followed by Operation Liane in late May, and the long- running Operation Annemarie which covered the period 7 May to 16 July 1944. In June 1944, a patrol from the battalion failed to return from a task in the vicinity of Cividale del Friuli. Two days later, they were found naked with their severed heads impaled on bayonets. The unit became known for shooting suspected partisans. While engaged in anti-partisan work, the battalion grew to a strength of around 1,000. =Expansion= alt=a soldier leading a team of two horses pulling a mountain gun up a hill On 18 July 1944, Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler ordered that the battalion be expanded to divisional size, although the authorised strength was only 6,600 troops. The 24th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Karstj√§ger was to be established by the Higher SS and Police Leader () for the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral, SS- Gruppenf√ºhrer (Major General) Odilo Globocnik. The name Karstj√§ger was derived from a combination of Karst, denoting the region of operations, and J√§ger, the German military term for light infantry. The division was to consist of two Gebirgsj√§ger (mountain infantry) regiments, with an artillery regiment, reconnaissance, Panzerj√§ger (anti-tank) and pioneer battalions, as well as replacement and supply troops. The division was supplied with 14 captured Italian Carro Armato P 40 tanks, but these proved unreliable, with only half being serviceable at any one time. In August 1944, the under-strength division participated in Operation Dachstein under the command of the 188th Mountain Division. Between August and November 1944, the division continued performing anti-partisan duties in the same region, but its strength had only reached 3,000, less than half of its authorised establishment. It proved impossible to recruit sufficient troops for the division, and in December 1944 the division was downgraded to a brigade. During late 1944 and early 1945, the Waffen Mountain (Karstj√§ger) Brigade of the SS fought first against British-supported partisans in the Julian Alps, and was then deployed to the coastal area around Trieste and the Marano-Grado Lagoon. In danger of being cut off by Allied forces, the brigade soon returned to the Julian Alps, having to fight its way through the Tagliamento river valley between Osoppo and Gemona. Toward the end of April 1945, the brigade fought British and New Zealand forces on the southern fringe of the Julian Alps. The brigade replacement company, which had been sent to Cividale from its training centre at Pottenstein, Bavaria, managed to destroy a number of British tanks with panzerfausts and the assistance of a tank company. In the final weeks of the war the brigade was part of a Kampfgruppe (battlegroup) commanded by SS-Brigadef√ºhrer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS (Brigadier) Heinz Harmel, which was ordered to keep the Karawanks passes open between Yugoslavia and Austria. This task was critical in allowing German forces to withdraw from Yugoslavia in order to surrender to British rather than Yugoslav forces. The Kampfgruppe succeeded in its final task, and was one of the last German units to surrender, when it encountered the British 6th Armoured Division on 9 May 1945. War crimes A joint Italian-German study implicated members of the division in 23 different crimes involving the killing of 277 people in Italy between the Armistice of Cassibile and the end of World War II. The largest of these killings were: * the Fosse del Natisone killings, which involved 113 people killed at the divisional barracks in Cividale del Friuli on unknown dates * the killing of 27 people in the village of Malga Pramosio near Paluzza on 21 July 1944 in retaliation for partisan attacks * the killing of 33 people in the village of Torlano near Nimis on 25 August 1944 in retaliation for partisan attacks * the killing of 21 male hostages between the towns of Terzo d'Aquileia and Cervignano del Friuli on 28/29 April 1945 in reprisal for partisan attacks * the massacre of 51 people in the village of Avasinis near Trasaghis on 2 May 1945 Order of battle alt=a tank with riveted hull and turret On paper, the division's final order of battle was to consist of: * 59th Waffen Gebirgsj√§ger (Mountain Infantry) Regiment of the SS (three battalions) * 60th Waffen Gebirgsj√§ger Regiment of the SS (three battalions) * 24th SS Mountain Artillery Regiment (four battalions) * 24th SS Reconnaissance Battalion * 24th SS Panzerj√§ger (Anti-tank) Battalion * 24th SS Pioneer Battalion * 24th SS Mountain Signals Battalion * 24th SS Replacement Battalion The division establishment also included supply units. However, only the 59th Waffen Gebirgsj√§ger Regiment, one battalion of the 24th SS Mountain Artillery Regiment, one company of the 24th SS Pioneer Battalion and a half-company of the divisional panzer company were ever established. Commanders According to historian Gordon Williamson, three Waffen-SS officers commanded the division and subsequently the brigade: * SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Karl Marx (Dec 1944) * SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Werner Hahn (Dec 1944Feb 1945) * SS-Oberf√ºhrer Adolf Wagner (FebMay 1945) In contrast, Roland Kaltenegger only lists Hahn as commanding the unit. Uniform The unit insignia was a stylised T√Ωr rune with arrows pointing to the left and right. A collar insignia was manufactured, but it is believed that these were never issued or worn, and the members of the division wore the standard SS Sig runes.

Early life She was born in Totnes in Devon, the daughter of Victor Whitburn and Eileen Wellington. She has a younger brother (born 1954). She failed her 11-plus and her parents sent her to a private convent school in Exeter (which closed in 1997). She graduated from the University of Hull with a BA degree in English and American Studies in 1974. Earlier career She joined the BBC after university in 1974 as a trainee sound technician. From 1976‚Äì77, she worked for BBC Television. From 1977, she worked as a producer in radio drama for the BBC, at their Radio Drama Unit, which produced the Afternoon Play. From 1977 to 1980, she was assistant producer of The Archers while William Smethurst was in charge of the programme. During this period she cast Trevor Harrison as Eddie Grundy and Sara Coward as Caroline Bone (later Pemberton and Stirling). \\"William Smethurst, recognised that I was good at directing and casting so he let me get on with that whilst he concentrated on storylines and scripts\\", she explained in 2010. From 1988‚Äì90, she was the producer of Channel 4's Brookside. According to Whitburn, she was with the programme for four years, during the period Jimmy McGovern was still a member of the scriptwriting team, =The Archers= She became the Editor of The Archers in June 1991.Independent June 1994 She became executive producer of all radio drama for BBC Birmingham at BBC Pebble Mill in 1995 (later based at The Mailbox), including Silver Street for the BBC Asian Network. Clashes between Whitburn and Smethurst (who had left the programme in 1986) became publicly known in 1996, with the former accusing Smethurst of \\"fluffy and frothy\\" Conservative propaganda, and the latter retaliating with the assertion that Whitburn had \\"no understanding of the countryside\\" and the serial under her had become \\"badly written feminist tripe\\". Smethurst wrote that then current plot lines simply did not happen in the countryside, although journalists pointed to real-life parallels. \\"Farming is, and will always be, central to the show. It‚Äôs our USP\\", she commented in 2010. \\"I drive in to work every day through the countryside and I‚Äôm always watching what the farmers are doing, and making sure we have covered that\\", she told Peter Stanford. The programme in Whitburn's hands was periodically accused of being politically correct. The racial origin of the South African character Lucas Madakane (Connie M'Gadzah) was not directly mentioned when he was introduced around 2001, which Victoria Mather in The Daily Telegraph thought \\"bizarre in a gossipy rural community\\". Mark Lawson of The Guardian wrote that while any racism in the serial's fictional Ambridge \\"may be occurring out of earshot\\", treatment was also dramatically realistic because the issue of a person's skin colour is now seldom referred to directly in Britain. It was also accused of being too melodramatic. \\"We can‚Äôt win\\", Whitburn said in 2010. \\"If I do nothing, people say it‚Äôs too dull\\". The 60th anniversary of the programme was billed as containing developments to \\"shake Ambridge to the core\\", which turned out to be long-term character Nigel Pargetter (Graham Seed) being killed in an accident. Whitburn left her position as the Editor of The Archers at the end of May 2013 after 22 years. From 2011‚Äì13 she was also Editor of Ambridge Extra. During the period Whitburn was Editor, The Archers had up to 5 million listeners. Her decision to formally retire from her roles was announced in March 2013. Personal life Whitburn lives in Stratford-upon-Avon, and also shares a house in Cape Town, South Africa with her partner. In February 1994, she had a car accident near Pebble Mill on her way into work.

It is the only known offering shrine from this period known to be still standing in its original form.Description of \\"Reconstruction of Xiaotang Mountain Shrine\\", Harvard Fine Arts Library, Special Collections The Xiaotang Mountain Shrine has been identified with as the Guo Family shrine by some studies, linking it to the story of Guo Ju, the 13th of the Confucian Twenty-four Filial Exemplars.\\"The Twenty-four Paragons of Filial Piety\\" (online article) History Funerary shrines have been built on top of the tombs of members of the upper nobility and feudal lords since the Warring States period (475-221 BC). Erecting such shrines as well as monumental towers became popular during the times of the Han Dynasty (207 BC-220 AD) and in particular in the era of the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 AD). The Xiaotang Mountain Han Shrine dates to the early Eastern Han Dynasty, but the exact date remains unknown.\\"Stone Shrine at the Guo Family Mausoleum\\", online article at www.chinaculture.org Historical inscriptions that were added to the shrine suggest that it dates back before the year 129 AD (the 4th year of the reign of the Eastern Han Emperor Shun of Han), to which the earliest inscription on the shrine is dated. The second oldest inscription date is the year when Emperor Huan of Han of the Eastern Han changed his era name to \\"Yongkang\\" (, in 167 AD). The shrine is mentioned in the \\"Commentary to the River Classic\\" (Shui Jing Zhu) by the Northern Wei Dynasty scholar Li Daoyuan (died 527 AD). The shrine is also recorded in the \\"Catalogue of Inscriptions on Stone and Bone\\" by Zhao Mingcheng (1081-1129 AD), a scholar-official and epigraphist in the Song Dynasty also known for being the husband to poet Li Qingzhao. The shrine was among the first 180 sites to be included in the List of Major National Historical and Cultural Sites on April 3, 1961. Shrine The Xiaotang Mountain Han Shrine is a free-standing masonry construction topped by a single-eaved and hanging hill-shaped roof. It that stands long, wide, and tall. The walls are made from black stones and are thick. An -tall octagonal stone pillar has been placed in the center of the shrine. The shrine is decorated with sunken images cut away from a surface as well as bas-relief images.A. Falco Howard, L. Song, W. Hung, Y. Hong (2006) \\"Chinese Sculpture\\", Yale University Press, p. 93 The stone walls and the triangular stone girders are engraved with depictions of legendary tales, historic events, time keeping and astrology, royal audiences, travel, guest receptions, war campaigns, hunting, cooking, and recreation. Other architectural components of the shrine carry simpler decorations with motives such as lowered curtains and water chestnut. An inscription of particular cultural history and calligraphic value is the \\"Odes to Moving Filial Piety\\" (Gan Xiao Song) written by King of Longdong in the Northern Qi Dynasty (550-577 AD) and engraved on the outside gable of the shrine. Filial piety The shrine has been identified with the story of Guo Ju (), the 13th of the 24 Paragons of Filial Piety. Guo Ju is said to have lived during the time of the Han Dynasty. He prepared to bury his own infant son during a period of food shortage in order to preserve enough food to save his aging mother. When he dug the grave for his son, he found a treasure (inscribed as a gift to him) that allowed him to save his entire family. Location Entrance gate building of the shrine complex The Xiaotang Mountain Han Shrine is located on Xiaotang Mountain (, literally \\"Filial Piety Hall Mountain\\").

Iskra emphazised studies of Marxist theory and its application in Egyptian society.Gorman, Anthony. Historians, State, and Politics in Twentieth Century Egypt: Contesting the Nation. London: Routledge, 2003. p. 90 Iskra's approach was that the first task of the communists was to build a base among revolutionary intellectuals, and that mass mobilisation would follow at a later stage. In 1944 Iskra established a study centre, Dar al-abahth al-'ilmiya (ÿØÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ®ÿ≠ÿßÿ´ ÿßŸÑÿπŸÑŸÖŸäÿ©, House of Scientific Research). The centre published literature and gave classes on communist thought. Iskra was one of the forces behind the foundation of the National People's University in 1945, an institution that provided courses in politics and social sciences for labour activists. In February 1946, Iskra was one of the groups that organised the National Committee of Workers and Students, a mass movement for national independence and social reforms. The National Committee lasted until July the same year. In 1947 the organisation began publishing the newspaper al-Jamahir (ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÖÿßŸáŸäÿ±, 'The Masses').Gorman, Anthony.

Historians, State, and Politics in Twentieth Century Egypt: Contesting the Nation. London: Routledge, 2003. p. 222 Social profile In comparison to other contemporary communist organisations in Egypt, the membership of Iskra largely consisted of intellectuals. Like all communist groups, the cadres were mainly urban and based in the Cairo area. A large number of the Iskra cadres were Europeanised Jews or belonging to other European minorities. Many of the Iskra activists belonged to the upper strata of Cairo society, and were often recruited from the Lyc√©e Fran√ßais du Caire. The recruitment was often done through arranging parties and social events. In 1945, Iskra had a membership of about 900. 40% of them were foreigners.Beinin, Joel. Was the Red Flag Flying There?: Marxist Politics and the Arab-Israeli Conflict in Egypt and Israel, 1948-1965. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990. p. 104-105Kr√§mer, Gudrun. The Jews in Modern Egypt, 1914-1952. London: I.B. Tauris, 1989. p. 178 Notably the Jewish members of the Iskra leadership took a more militant anti-Zionist approach than the non-Jewish cadres. Around 1946/early 1947 they formed the Jewish Anti-Zionist League. It was in Iskra that the first female communists were organized in Egypt. Some of the first women cadres were Latifa az-Zayyat, Soraya Adham, Fatma Zaki, Inge Aflatun, Aim√©e Setton and Odette Hazan Solomon.Beinin, Joel. Was the Red Flag Flying There?: Marxist Politics and the Arab-Israeli Conflict in Egypt and Israel, 1948-1965. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990. p. 104, 272 The Iskra group soon got the reputation of being a haven for sexual libertinism. In fact the anti-communist discourse in Egypt at the time, which was centered around claims that the communist movement was morally depraved and dominated by Jews, was largely based on the reputation of the Iskra group. Other communist factions became harshly critical of Iskra, especially the role of women in the organisation. Henri Curiel, leader of HAMITU, criticized Iskra for organizing parties as a tool for political recruitment.

This is not as easy as scaling HD1080 content. In practice, these displays are made with 272 rows of pixels where it is more convenient to manufacture pixels in multiples of 8x8.

History Founded in 1825, Bnai Jeshurun was the second synagogue founded in New York and the third-oldest Ashkenazi synagogue in the United States. The synagogue was founded by a coalition of young members of congregation Shearith Israel and immigrants and the descendants of immigrants from the German and Polish lands. It was the stated intention to follow the \\"German and Polish minhag (rite).\\"Sarna, Jonathan, American Judaism, Yale University Press, 2004, p. 56. The order of prayers followed that of the Ashkenazi Great Synagogue of London, and the congregation sought the guidance of the British chief Rabbi Solomon Hirschell on matters of ritual. They first held services on Pearl Street, and dedicated their first building on Elm Street in Manhattan in 1829. The first rabbi, Samuel Myer Isaacs, was appointed in 1839. In 1845, a schism formed in the congregation leadership. By 1850, the congregation had grown large enough to make it necessary to build a new synagogue. A building on Greene Street was dedicated on September 25, 1851, and the Jewish newspaper Asmonean described the edifice and its builders as admirable. Its rabbi in the 1850s and 1860s, when it was frequently called \\"the Greene Street Synagogue\\", was Morris Jacob Raphall. By 1852, it had started a Hebrew school open to the entire city's Jews, of all varieties, and by 1854 had opened a separate school building a few doors down Greene Street. B'nai Jeshurun had a cemetery on 32nd Street. In 1864, the congregation moved yet again, to a new building on 34th Street, the parcel later part of the site of the flagship Macy's store. Driven by the rapid expansion of the city, they moved yet again in the spring of 1885 to Madison Avenue at 65th Street. That building was designed by Rafael Guastavino and Schwarzmann & Buchman. Less than a year later, a fire did extensive damage to the building. Reports rated the damage at $35,000. B'nai Jeshurun was temporarily relocated to Congregation Ahawath Chesed on Lexington Avenue, which ironically had a fire of its own within the month, leaving both congregations homeless. Henry Jacobs was another long-serving rabbi. He had a 17-year tenure, ending in January, 1893. The present building, located at 257 West 88th Street, between Broadway and West End Avenue, was dedicated in 1917. It was designed by Henry B. Herts, a congregant and celebrated theater architect, with Walter S. Schneider. See also: In addition to its place on the National Register of Historic Places, the synagogue was included in the New York City Riverside Drive-West End Historic District created in 1990. The muqarna-studded ceiling was redesigned following its collapse during renovations in the early 1990s and was replaced with a future-invoking space frame back-lit to simulate a nighttime sky . =Breakaway congregations= B'nai Jeshurun's original founders broke from the city's only synagogue, Shearith Israel, in 1825, in order to create an Ashkenazi congregation. Subsequently, B'nai Jeshurun members broke away to form new shuls several times. In 1828, at a time of rapid growth in the New York Jewish community, a group left B'nai Jeshurun to found Ansche Chesed. In 1845, Temple Shaaray Tefila was founded by 50 primarily English and Dutch Jews who had been members of B'nai Jeshurun. =Affiliation= B'nai Jeshurun took a leading role in founding the Board of Directors of American Israelites in 1859. By 1874, there were divisions within the congregation over remaining strictly orthodox or adopting ideas from the Reform movement, and by 1875, it was in litigation, with the Reformed movement ultimately winning in court. The Board of Delegates affiliated with the Reform movement's Union of American Hebrew Congregations in 1878, but in 1884 it left. Two years later, it also supported the founding of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS) in 1886, a school formed to support Orthodoxy in combating the Reform movement. In 1870, it worked with the other \\"conservative\\" (non-Reform) synagogues of the city to develop a uniform siddur. In 1889, the congregation published its own edition of the prayer book. When Solomon Schechter used JTS to create a more conservative set of reforms to traditional Judaism, B'nai Jeshurun joined his United Synagogue of America, now the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism. In the 1990s the congregation left the Conservative movement and is now independent. =Contemporary= A spiritual and demographic renaissance began in 1985, with the arrival of Rabbi Marshall Meyer. A \\"Stonewall Shabbat Seder\\" was first held at B‚Äônai Jeshurun in 1995.

He is one of those who were dubbed \\"The Forgotten Ten\\". Background Moran was born in Crossna, Ardcarn, County Roscommon. He was the third of eleven children of Bartholemew and Brigid Moran, and attended primary school in Crossna before going to work as a grocer's assistant in Boyle. In 1911, he settled in Dublin.Reinterment (sic) of 10 volunteers executed from Dept. of the Taoiseach; accessed 2 November 2008. An active member of the Gaelic Athletic Association, he was involved in the 1913 Dublin Lock-out. He was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and the Irish Volunteers. As Adjutant of D Company, 2nd Battalion of the Dublin section of the Volunteers he fought in the Jacob's Factory Garrison during the Easter Rising of 1916 under Thomas MacDonagh. In the aftermath of the Easter Rising, he was imprisoned at Knutsford Prison and later at Frongoch. He was tried in Wormwood Scrubs and released in July 1916. In 1917, he was a founder of the Irish National Union of Vintners, Grocers and Allied Trades Assistants. He went on to serve as the organisation's president and chairman of its Kingstown branch. Arrest and detention After his release from internment, Moran became a captain in 'D' Company of the 2nd Battalion, Dublin Brigade, IRA. He was arrested on one occasion in 1920 during a strike for better conditions for members of his union and was imprisoned in Mountjoy for two weeks when he refused to take bail as he said he had done no wrong. He was arrested at his place of work on the Friday after Bloody Sunday (1920) and taken to the Bridewell Station. He was transferred two weeks later to Arbour Hill. During the Bloody Sunday action to wipe out a group of British spies in Dublin, on 21 November 1920, Moran headed the IRA squad that killed two men in the Gresham Hotel in O'Connell Street: Leonard Wilde, a former British Consul in Spain,http://www.bloodysunday.co.uk/murdered-men/wilde.html and Patrick Joseph MacCormack, a World War I veteran and ex-jockey.

While in detention at Arbour Hill Prison, he was subjected to a number of identity parades and identified as being the man who had held up a motor cyclist outside 38 Mount Street, Dublin where Lieutenant Ames, a suspected intelligence officer was murdered. He strongly protested his innocence of involvement in that incident on Bloody Sunday. He claimed he was at Mass in Blackrock (over four miles from the scene of the shooting) at the time. Several witnesses supported this alibi evidence but it was false.Moran, May.

On 14 February 1921, Moran, O'Malley and Frank Teeling broke through the padlock of an outer gate of the prison. However, Moran refused to take the opportunity to escape as he reportedly felt the authorities would interpret it as an admission of guilt, telling O'Malley \\"I don't want to let down the witnesses who gave evidence for me.\\"\\"Kevin Barry - Just a Lad of 18 Summers\\" , thewildgeese.com; retrieved 27 January 2009. Moran started a concert to distract the guards while the men escaped, with Simon Donnelly taking Moran's place. The event is related in detail in O'Malley's memoir On Another Man's Wound. He was tried the day following the break out in City Hall, Dame Street, Dublin. Moran was convicted of murder three days later and sentenced to be hanged on 14 March 1921. Moran and Thomas Whelan were tried for murder; Francis Flood, Thomas Bryan, Patrick Doyle and Bernard Ryan for high treason. They were all convicted and sentenced to death. The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin spoke out against the sentence. The Irish National Union of Vintners' Grocers' & Allied Trades' Assistants, of which Moran had been an active member, called a half-day general strike on the morning of the executions and over 40,000 people gathered outside Mountjoy to pray for the six men who were hanged between 6am and 8pm. The townships of Bray, D√∫n Laoghaire, and Blackrock closed down, with the municipal flags flying at half- mast, on the day of his hanging, with Mass celebrated in all churches every hour from 6am to noon. All post office branches throughout Ireland stopped work.Evening Herald 14 March 1921. Aftermath and reinterment In 1961, a park was opened in Moran's memory in D√∫n Laoghaire. He had worked in Dun Laoghaire from 1916-20 in the premises of Lynch and O'Brien. He moved to Magees in Blackrock just two months prior to his arrest in November 1920. In May 2012, the park was closed to the public as work commenced on the removal of the bowling green, and the construction of a library and cultural centre. In 2001, he and the other nine executed men (dubbed \\"the Forgotten Ten\\") were exhumed from their graves in the prison and given a full State Funeral. He is now buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin. Bibliography * O'Malley, Ernie.

It is endemic to North Carolina in the United States. The name nantahala is a Cherokee word which means noonday. This subspecies was given this name because the snail lives in a deep gorge where the sunshine does not reach the ground until the middle of the day.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. July 3, 1978. Final Determination that Seven Eastern U.S. Land Snails are Endangered or Threatened Species  Shell description  Patera clarki nantahala The shell of the noonday globe snail is moderately sized (3/4 inch wide and 1/2 inch high) and globose in shape. The outer shell surface is shiny and reddish in color. Shells of this subspecies often exhibit 5 and half whorls. The shell surface is sculptured with rather coarse lines. The area around the shell opening (aperture) is white, and a long curved \\"tooth\\" is located on the inside portion of the aperture. The width of the shell is 18 mm. The height of the shell is 11 mm. The body is black.  Distribution  Map of North Carolina with Swain County marked in red Patera clarki nantahala is endemic to North Carolina, where it is known only from the Nantahala Gorge in Swain County in the Appalachian Mountains.Patera clarki. NatureServe. 2013. It occurs along about two miles of high cliffs on the eastern side of the gorge.2001\\\\. Guide to Federally Listed Endangered and Threatened Species of North Carolina . Noonday globe snail, Patera clarki nantahala, page 67 , North Carolina Natural Heritage Program This subspecies was probably never widely distributed. Its native habitat of steep wet slopes with calcareous rocks is rare in western North Carolina. It probably had a wider range before the gorge underwent the construction of a railroad and U.S. Route 19. Both of these projects altered the forest community along the river. The associated loss of the forest canopy allowed more sunlight to penetrate the gorge, drying the substrate on the lower slopes. This habitat alteration changed the floral and faunal assemblage, allowing non-native plants such as kudzu and Japanese honeysuckle to invade some roadside areas. In an attempt to secure the snail's continued existence, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service added it as a threatened subspecies, to the Federal Endangered and Threatened Species List on July 3, 1978.SEVEN SNAILS LISTED AS ENDANGERED OR THREATENED - July 3, 1978 http://www.fws.gov/news/historic/1978/19780703a.pdf It is a Federal offense punishable by as much as a $50,000 fine and one year in jail for taking a noonday snail.  Ecology  Because this snail is so rare and restricted in distribution, very little is known of its biology. = Habitat = This land snail is found in damp oak-hickory forest. The cliffs in the Nantahala Gorge region are very wet, intersected by many small streams and waterfalls. The forest is mature, with many large trees and a diverse plant community. The forest floor has a thick, rich humus layer, and the area has many exposed limestone rocks. Calcium carbonate, which is generally scarce in other cliffs in the area, is vital to most snails, because it is a major component of their shells. The rich, moist calcareous soils, and the mature forest community are likely to account for the unusually wide variety of snails which inhabit the area; Patera clarki nantahala being found in association with 29 other snail species. This subspecies appears to be most active during wet weather, when it is frequently found out on the surface of vegetation, rather than under the leaf litter on the forest floor. = Feeding habits = The feeding habits of P. clarki are unknown, but other related species in the genus Patera feed on fungi, in particular the subsurface, hair- like mycelia. = Life cycle = This subspecies' reproductive behavior is currently unknown. = Interspecific relationships = Snails are usually exploited as a food source by other animals. A common carnivorous land snail, Haplotrema concavum, was observed eating a noonday globe snail, and gnawed shells of the other subspecies of this snail, Patera clarki clarki, have been found in the dens of small rodents.

A graduate of Franklin & Marshall College, where he earned a degree in teaching and spent four years on several of its sports teams, Bridenbaugh coached football at several places in his home state of Pennsylvania prior to being selected as the head coach of the Geneva College Golden Tornadoes in 1917. He left Geneva in 1922 with a 23‚Äì12‚Äì5 record and took a job with New Castle Junior/Senior High School as a mathematics teacher and head football, basketball, and track and field coach. He did not lose a football game in his first two years, marking the first of eleven undefeated seasons, and, over the course of 33 years, won seven league titles in the sport, leaving in 1955 with a 265‚Äì65‚Äì25 record. He continued to work as an assistant football coach at Grove City College until 1964 and was inducted into several regional halls of fame. He died in June 1990 at the age of 100. Early life Bridenbaugh was born on May 1, 1890 in Martinsburg, Pennsylvania, one of 14 children of Professor Phillip Howard Bridenbaugh, an educator and academic administrator, and Catherine Oelling. He attended Altoona Area High School in Altoona, Pennsylvania for one year, and then enrolled in a university-preparatory school, prior to entering Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 1908. At Franklin & Marshall he competed in track and field, football, basketball, and baseball while earning a teaching degree, despite the fact that \\"football was considered out of bounds in the Bridenbaugh family\\". In football, he played in the position of quarterback and was team captain during his senior year. During his first season, the team went 4‚Äì6‚Äì1, but it improved to a winning record of 9‚Äì1 the following year, with its sole loss being against Carnegie Mellon University. In his final two years at the institution, the squad went 4‚Äì3‚Äì2 and 3‚Äì6. He graduated in 1912 and married Belva Rebecca Crissman, a teacher in Martinsburg, on June 8, 1916. They had three children: Betty, J. Ross, and Audrey. Coaching career Bridenbaugh's first assistant coaching job was with the Oberlin Yeomen of Oberlin College under head coach T. Nelson Metcalf. He then spent two seasons at Kiski Preparatory School in Saltsburg, Pennsylvania and another two at Beaver Falls High School. In 1917 he became the ninth head coach of Geneva College's Golden Tornadoes in Beaver Falls. His record in this first season was 5‚Äì3‚Äì1, although the team allowed as many points as they scored (114). He went 4‚Äì2 in 1918, outscoring the opposition 67‚Äì36, and 4‚Äì2‚Äì2 in 1919, despite a negative point differential of 51‚Äì59 caused by a 2‚Äì33 loss to the University of Pittsburgh. In 1920 his record was 5‚Äì2‚Äì1, outscoring other institutions 125‚Äì61 despite a 0‚Äì47 loss to Pittsburgh. He was 5‚Äì3‚Äì1 in his final season, with a positive point differential of 106‚Äì49; half of their points scored during this year came in a 54‚Äì0 victory over Juniata College. Following his resignation, he was replaced by Robert Park, who was head of the history department, for the 1922 season, and then Tom Davies in 1923. During this time he also coached the school's basketball team. In his first season, 1917‚Äì18, he went 13‚Äì2, outscoring his opponents 524‚Äì303 and losing against only Allegheny College and Westminster College. He maintained a winning record for the next two seasons, going 10‚Äì7 for the 1918‚Äì1919 season and 10‚Äì9 in 1919‚Äì1920. In the latter case, the Golden Tornadoes managed a positive point margin of 599‚Äì581. Bridenbaugh went 7‚Äì14 for the 1920‚Äì1921 season, being outscored 584‚Äì631, and 8‚Äì10 in his final year, with a 546‚Äì589 point record. In 1922 Bridenbaugh was hired by New Castle Junior/Senior High School as a mathematics teacher and as their head football coach. He was undefeated in his first two seasons with New Castle, posting an 8‚Äì0‚Äì1 record in 1922, with a point differential of 229‚Äì54, and finishing 10‚Äì0‚Äì1 in 1923. He continued his undefeated streak for another 13 games in 1924, before being bested 0‚Äì14 by a team from Ellwood City that went on to have a perfect season. He coached at New Castle for 33 years, earning the nickname \\"The Fox\\", and left in 1955 with a record of 265‚Äì65‚Äì25, which included 11 undefeated seasons, seven one-loss seasons, and seven Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League (WPIAL) championships (1924, 1932‚Äì34, 1942, 1948‚Äì49); at the time of his death, this was believed to be the best record in Pennsylvanian high school football history and the fourth-best in the United States. He also coached basketball at New Castle, leaving with a 319‚Äì159 record and two victories at the WPIAL championships in 1927 and 1936, and ran the track and field program. He ended his career by serving as an assistant coach at Grove City College in Grove City, Pennsylvania until 1964. Later life Bridenbaugh's wife died on March 19, 1982. A plaque listing his accomplishments was hung at the school in 1971 and he was inducted into the Western Chapter of the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in 1972, the Lawrence County Historical Society Sports Hall of Fame in 1984, the Pennsylvania High School Football Coaches Hall of Fame in 1989, and the Franklin & Marshall College Athletics Hall of Fame in 1994. He died on June 14, 1990 of heart disease, at the Indian Creek Nursing Center in New Castle, Pennsylvania, at the age of 100. The field at New Castle is named jointly in honor of Bridenbaugh and Lindy Lauro, a player under Bridenbaugh who later coached New Castle to a 220‚Äì104‚Äì15 record, making it the only high school in the nation with two coaches who earned 200 or more victories.

Early life Holcomb grew up in Southwick, Massachusetts, the son of Elijah Holcomb and Lucy Holcomb, and a descendant of the immigrant Thomas Holcomb. There were no schools in his district, so he didn't have formal schooling, but gave himself an education. He studied books on geometry, navigation, optics and astronomy that were previously owned by his uncle Abijah, who was lost at sea. At fifteen years of age Holcomb became a tutor at a private school in Suffield, Connecticut, teaching college preparatory courses to students older than himself. Mid life Holcomb went into the business of surveying land about 1808 since he was familiar with optics and associated equipment. For a while he also did private tutoring in the fields of surveying, optics, and astronomy. In the 1820s he manufactured many sets of surveyors' instruments. His buyers were his students as well as other civil engineers. Holcomb wrote his own almanac in 1807 and 1808, when he was twenty-one years old, because he found Nehemiah Strong's almanac was in need of much improvement. It did not predict the 1806 solar eclipse that he viewed on January 4 of that year. Holcomb had made astronomical computations from the books he had on hand and predicted this eclipse himself. Holcomb observed the eclipse with instruments he had made himself. Sometime around 1810 he decided to fabricate surveying instruments, selling chains, compasses, and small transit telescopes. He also fabricated for sale magnets, electrical apparatus and leveling instruments. He was quite successful in the surveying trade, however left it in 1825 and went into civil engineering.  Holcomb‚Äôs telescopes reflecting telescope on display at the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia Holcomb fabricated the first telescopes manufactured in the United States. The first reflecting telescope Holcomb made to order was for John A. Fulton of Chillicothe, Ohio, about 1826. It was fourteen feet long with a ten-inch (254 mm) aperture with six eye pieces with a magnification of from 90 to 960 times. He fabricated and manufactured telescopes in earnest soon thereafter, probably around 1828,Loomis, p. 376 which marked the first such manufacturing business in the United States. He enjoyed making telescopes and at the beginning of his manufacturing venture he never thought of it ever becoming a profitable business, just a labor of love. The telescopes he made were in four sizes: # fourteen feet long with a ten-inch (254 mm) aperture # ten feet long with an eight-inch (203 mm) aperture # seven and a half feet long with a six-inch (152 mm) aperture # five feet long with a four-inch (102 mm) aperture In 1830 Holcomb brought an achromatic telescope to Professor Benjamin Silliman at Yale University in New Haven. After inspection the professor ordered one for Yale University and published a notice of it in the American Journal of Science. Around 1833 he began to get orders for his telescopes. Holcomb's telescopes in 1834, 1835, and 1836 were inspected by a committee at the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia and granted awards for their outstanding workmanship. On the committee to examine his telescopes were Robert M. Patterson (director of the United States Mint), Alexander D. Bach (superintendent of the Coast survey), Dr Robert Hare (chemist), Sears Cook Walker, James Pollard Espy, and Isiah T. Lukens.Journal of the Franklin Institute, volume 14, p. 169, volume 16, p. 11, and volume 18, p. 312 In 1834, he was awarded the John Scott award, presented by the City of Philadelphia, under the recommendation of the Franklin Institute.The Franklin Institute Awards - Laureate Database page on Amasa Holcomb Holcomb's telescope fabricated in 1835 was the largest telescope in America in its day. Institutional customers of Holcomb's were Brown University, Delaware College, and Williston Academy. A telescope of Holcomb's went to the East Indies and one to the Hawaiian Islands. Holcomb remained the only telescope maker in the United States until Henry Fitz and Alvan Clark began making refractor telescopes. Holcomb retired from telescope making in 1846.  Smithsonian Two telescopes manufactured by Holcomb were donated by Holcomb's descendants to the Smithsonian Institution in 1933. Until then they were in the attic of the family home in Southwick, Massachusetts. * Herschelian reflector, aperture, in length, shown at the Franklin Institute in 1835, USNM 310598. * Transit telescope, refractor, 21 inches in length, mounted on a cross tube with graduated circle, but lacking the base, USNM 310599.  Other aspects of his life  In 1816 Holcomb was chosen a \\"father\\" in his town he lived in. He held a city office position there during four successive years and occasionally by subsequent elections. In 1832 he was chosen to represent the town in the Legislature of Massachusetts. In 1852 Holcomb was elected to the State senate. He served three terms in the Massachusetts legislature, was a Justice of the Peace for the county of Hampden for over 50 years, and had been a Methodist minister since 1831, preaching until he was 80 years old. Holcomb was also a trustee of Wesleyan University. In 1837 he received from Williams College the Honorary degree of A.M. Holcomb died when he was 87 years old in March 1875.

Title The title comes from a quotation by Charles Divine (1889-1950) in his poem \\"At the Lavender Lantern\\": \\"Some said it was Bohemia, this little haunt we knew When hearts were high and fortunes low, and onions in the stew\\"The poem is about a \\"snug cafe, half restaurant, half home\\" remembered by a soldier in the First World War. Bohemia here refers to a happy free place, the haunt of Bohemians rather than the country. Synopsis The book opens just after Pearl Harbor; divorced mother Betty and her two daughters, 12-year-old Anne and 11-year-old Joan, are living in Betty's mother's home and Betty works in a building contractor's office. She meets and marries Donald MacDonald. Their search for a home is made difficult by the wartime influx of population into the greater Seattle area, but they find a property on Vashon Island. Their house was intended as a summer home, so it is cold in winter and their priorities change. \\"Creosote logs\\" on the beach are highly prized. Stormy weather brings a \\"bark tide\\" of firewood which must be quickly gathered. Various neighbours provide help, hindrance or confusion. The early part describes the problems of settling into a rural community without urban infrastructure. One issue is commuting from a home without a road. The family has the choice of the beach, if the tide is low, or walking to a neighbor's driveway to catch the school bus. The adults must follow a muddy trail to catch a ferry, usually in a rush. At the same time, there are quite poetic pieces on some of the joys of getting food from the sea and land, and domestic scenes of the girls going through adolescence.

As of the 2019‚Äì20 season, the club play in Championnat National 3, the fifth level of French football, and are managed by Erwan Lannuzel. History The club was formed in 1921 as Sporting Club Poitevin, and joined the Division d'Honneur of the Ligue du Centre-Ouest in 1936. In 1952 the club lost its place in the league, and in order to regain it, merged with another local club Patronage des √âcoles Publiques de Poitiers, becoming known as Stade Poitevin PEPP. The new club were champions of the DH Centre-Ouest in 1963, and gained promotion to the top level of amateur football, known as the Championnat de France Amateur. The club was invited to the new \\"open\\" Division 2 in 1970. They were relegated to Division 3 in 1974 and Division 4 in 1988. Under the management of Denis Devaux the club achieved two successive promotions and played in the professional Division 2 for one season in 1995‚Äì96. Successive relegations followed, and the club played in Championnat de France Amateur 2 between 1999 and 2003. They were promoted again during the 2003‚Äì04 season, but suffered financial problems and were administratively relegate back to the Division d'Honneur. The club relaunched under a new identity of Poitiers Foot 86 and in 2007 merged with rival club Cercle Education Physique Poitiers, taking the name Poitiers Football Club. With this identity the club won promotion to CFA2 in 2009. They were relegated again to Division d'Honneur at the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season. In February 2016 the club announced a plan to return to their old Stade Poitevin FC name, and colours of black and white.

He was 22 years old at the time of his death.  Background  Whelan was born in Gortrummagh near Clifden, Co Galway to John and Bridget Whelan on 5 October 1898, the sixth child of thirteen. He attended national school at Beleek and Clifden, before leaving school at 15 to work on his father's farm. He moved to Dublin at the age of 18, where he found work as a railwayman, and joined the Irish Volunteers as a member of 'A' Company, 3rd Battalion, Dublin Brigade.http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/index.asp?locID=383&docID;=511http://republican- news.org/archive/2001/October11/11forg.html He lived at Barrow Street, Ringsend, Dublin and worked at a train depot.  Arrest and execution  He was arrested on 23 November 1920 and, on 1 February 1921, he was charged with the death by shooting of Captain G.T. Baggallay, an army prosecutor who had been a member of courts that sentenced Volunteers to death under the Restoration of Order in Ireland RegulationsRichard Bennett, pg 106 The Black and Tans; on Bloody Sunday (1920). Whelan was defended at his court martial by Michael Noyk, through whom he protested his innocence of the charges. As in the case of Patrick Moran, there was eyewitness evidence that Whelan had been at Mass at the time the shooting took place. The prosecution cast doubt on the reliability of the eyewitnesses, arguing that as Catholics they were not neutral. The defence complained that it was unfair to suggest the witnesses \\"were prepared to come up and perjure themselves on behalf of the prisoner\\" because \\"they belonged to a certain class and might hold certain political opinions\\". The court did, however, trust the evidence of an army officer who lived in the same house as Baggallay and who had identified Whelan as the man covering him with a revolver during the raid. There was also testimony by a soldier who had passed by the house when he heard shots fired. This witness said he saw Whelan outside, attempting to start his motorcycle. Whelan was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. In Mountjoy Gaol, he was imprisoned with the writer and activist Ernie O'Malley, who described him as: > \\"... smooth-faced, quiet and brown eyed with wavy hair; he smiled quietly > and steadily. His voice was soft and when he laughed with the others one > knew that the fibre was not as hard and that there was a shade of > wistfulness about him.\\" Whelan was hanged at 6.00 am along with Patrick Moran, the first of six men to be executed that day ‚Äì the six were executed in twos. A crowd estimated at 40,000 gathered outside the prison to pray as the executions took place. His mother, Bridget, saw him before his execution, and waited outside with the praying crowd holding candles. She told a reporter that she had left her son \\"so happy and cheerful you would almost imagine he was going to see a football match\\".  Reinterment  He was one of a group of men hanged in Mountjoy Prison in the period 1920-1921 who are commonly referred to as The Forgotten Ten. In 2001 he and the other nine, including Kevin Barry, were exhumed from their graves in the prison and given a full state funeral. He is now buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin. An annual commemoration is still held in Clifden for him.

A close friend and associate of Irish mob boss John Morrissey, Baker frequently battled supporters of the nativist Know-Nothing movement for over a decade. He is most remembered however as the assassin of William \\"Bill the Butcher\\" Poole. Baker shot and killed Poole in a Broadway saloon during a brawl.

He soon became involved in violent fighting against the many nativist organizations of the period, in particular, the Bowery Boys. In January 1855, Baker and Jim Turner entered Platt's Hall and became involved in a verbal altercation with prizefighter Tom Hyer \\"calling the fighter vile names\\". The argument escalated until Turner drew his pistol and shot Hyer in the neck. Hyer fired back but missed hitting the wall instead. Putting away his weapon, Hyer attacked his assailants and dragged Baker out into the street but the fight came to an end when a police officer arrived. The fight was broken up, but no charges were brought against the three.Sutton, Charles; James B. Mix and Samuel A. Mackeever, ed. The New York Tombs: Its Secrets and Its Mysteries.

Walking up to Poole, Baker spat in his face and then pulled a Colt revolver but accidentally shot himself in the arm as he stepped back to draw the weapon. Dropping to the floor, he did manage to fire a second shot hitting Poole in the leg and similarly incapacitating him. Both men eventually got up from the floor, however Baker managed to get to Poole first and pistol whipped him back to the ground. Baker then shot Poole twice, once in the stomach and the second in his chest, and left the saloon. A second version according to retired police chief George W. Walling, Turner and McLaughlin had a more active role in the fight. It was McLaughlin, he claimed, who challenged Poole to a fight spitting in his face each time he refused.

History In 1941, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill made an urgent appeal to the United States to provide war materials and pilot training for defense against a superior German air power which bombarded England during the Battle of Britain. President Franklin Roosevelt responded by implementing the Lend Lease Act, which called for the construction of six British Flying Training Schools in California, Arizona, Oklahoma, Texas and the British Flying Training School (BFTS) #5 at Riddle Field near the town of Clewiston, Florida, which trained more than 1,700 cadets in the Royal Air Force. The airfield was opened on 12 November 1942 by the United States Army Air Forces. Assigned to USAAF Southeast Training Center (later Southeast Flying Training Command). It conducted contract basic flying training by Riddle-McKay Aero College (which was at the time one of six divisions of the Embry-Riddle School of Aviation), under the jurisdiction of the 75th Flying Training Detachment (Contract Pilot School) Daily life at Riddle Field consisted of Primary flight training in the Stearman PT-17, Basic flying training in the Vultee BT-13, through to completion of the Advanced flying course in the Harvard AT-6. The cadets also received extensive training in formation flying, acrobatic maneuvers, armaments and instrument navigation. More than 1,300 cadets earned their wings at Riddle Field and returned to England to face their two greatest enemies, the Nazis, and the weather. Local volunteers established a Cadet Club in what was known as the Pioneer Building (on Ponce deLeon Street behind present day U.S. Sugar Corp.) where dances and games were provided. The Clewiston Inn also served as a meeting place for officers and cadets to socialize.

It is a sophisticated Trojan horse that uses stealth techniques to hide itself from the user. The Trojan opens a back door on the victim's computer which allows the attacker complete control over the computer. Payload The Trojan infects the MBR to allow itself to start even before the operating system starts. This allows it to bypass some safeguards and embed itself deep within the operating system. It is known that the Trojan can intercept read/write operations, embed itself deep within network drivers. This allows it the ability to bypass some firewalls and communicate securely, using a custom encrypted tunnel, to the command and control server. This allows the attacker to install other malware, viruses, or other applications. The Trojan most commonly steals information from the victim's computer, in an attempt for small financial gain. Mebroot is linked to Anserin, which is another Trojan that logs keystrokes and steals banking information. This gives further evidence showing that financial motive is most likely behind Mebroot. Detection/removal The Trojan tries to avoid detection by hooking itself into atapi.sys. It also embeds itself in the Ntoskrnl.exe. Mebroot has no executable files, no registry keys, and no driver modules, which makes it harder to detect without antivirus software. In addition to running antivirus software, one can also remove the Trojan by wiping or repairing the master boot record, the hard drive, and the operating system. Distribution Three variants of Mebroot have been discovered. It was estimated that the first version was compiled in November 2007. In December, Mebroot started drive-by downloads. In early 2008, a second wave of attacks arrived. In February 2008 a second variant was discovered which is accompanied by a modified installer. In March 2008 a third variant was discovered, in which attacks became more widespread. Since the third variant, the Trojan has been upgraded to try and outwit antivirus software. It is unknown if Mebroot is still in the wild. Mebroot is currently known to be distributed by visiting malicious websites, or by way of an application exploit. It is estimated that over 1,500 websites have been compromised, mostly in the European region. Traffic to websites infected with Mebroot can reach 50,000 to 100,000 views per day.

Unlike most rugby internationals, Cowey was most associated with the Army Rugby Union rather than club or county rugby. In later life he became Chairman of the Army Rugby Union.Army Rugby Union site Rugby career Cowey was born in Tidworth, Wiltshire in 1911 but when he joined the British Armed Forces, he was posted in the Welch Regiment, traditionally the reserve of Welsh nationals. He played rugby while on duty, for his regiment and later played for the Army's own rugby team. Outside the army, Cowey played for two first class rugby union clubs: London Welsh and Newport. It was while playing with Newport that he was selected to play for Wales, after his service with the Welch Regiment made him eligible to represent his adoptive country. Cowey's first cap was in the 1934 Home Nations Championship, where he was one of 13 new caps to be tested by Wales, in a match at the Cardiff Arms Park against England. Wales's inexperience showed and they lost 9‚Äì0. Although five of the players from that match were never selected for Wales again, Cowey wasn't amongst them and returned for the next game against Scotland. The Scottish game was far more successful for Wales, with a strong performance from Cliff Jones. Cowey repaid the selectors' trust in him with two tries in the Scotland match, and again in the last game of the tournament when he scored another against Ireland. Cowey's final game for Wales was during the 1935 Championship when he again faced England.

After graduating from high school, he attended the Leipzig Conservatory, where he studied music theory with Max Reger and piano with Robert Teichm√ºller. He also studied with Richard Strauss and later in Strasbourg with Hans Pfitzner. His conducting debut was in Breslau in 1923. He then worked as musical director and opera conductor in Essen (1924‚Äì31) and Dortmund (until 1933). In Dortmund he had to leave his position in the spring of 1933 due to the Nazi rise to power. He emigrated first to France and later to the United States. He conducted the Monte Carlo opera in 1936 and 1937. While in France, he was also the teacher of composer Lukas Foss, who studied orchestration with him. In 1938 he moved to New York city, where he worked as an assistant conductor at the Metropolitan Opera, where he stayed until 1947. In 1948 he followed a call to the New England Conservatory in Boston, where he taught for two decades. He died in Boston, aged 78. Musical compositions and editing Wolfes composed at least 140 songs that are published. Most were composed after he moved to Boston, but he continued to set German poetry. There are a few songs in English, however. As a disciple of Strauss and Pfitzner, Wolfes composed vocal works using similar complex rhythmic and harmonic materials. He was also highly skilled in editing and preparing the vocal scores for operas from the full orchestral score. Some of his important work in this area was for the Strauss opera Arabella and the Pfitzner opera Palestrina. He also prepared vocal scores for Strauss's opera Die schweigsame Frau and Pfitzner's operas Das Herz and Die Rose vom Liebesgarten.

It is located in the Colonial district of Santo Domingo. It was the Palace of the Viceroy of Santo Domingo and it is the first (oldest) headquarters of Spanish power in the New World. The building dates back to the sixteenth century, and was built to house the administrative offices of the Spanish colonies in the Americas, at the time any trespassers would be sentenced to death. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site called Colonial City of Santo Domingo.  History  The palace was built by orders of the Spanish Crown, represented by King Ferdinand II of Aragon, on October 5 of 1511 to house the main government offices of the colony in two interconnected buildings (hence the plural Casas Reales). In the first (South) section was the Royal Audiencia, the first court of the New World, as well as the office of the Comptroller General. The second (North) section was used by the successive Viceroys, Governors and Captains-General. The original architectural structure has undergone a number of changes through the country's history. In 1807, during the period of French sovereignty over the Eastern part of Hispaniola, French general Louis Ferrand gave the facade a classical architectural style. During the last year of government of President Carlos Felipe Morales, some changes were made to use the building as the Governmental Palace. The Presidency later moved to a mansion on the site of today's Palacio Nacional. During the government of Rafael Le√≥nidas Trujillo other modifications were made in order to house government offices. Trujillo's office, and an extensive collection of arms and armor that he purchased, remain on display. The building was later restored to its original 16th- century appearance and was established on October 18, 1973, during the administration of President Joaqu√≠n Balaguer, as a museum to highlight the history, life and customs of the inhabitants of the Spanish colony. However, it was not officially opened until May 31, 1976. Attending the opening ceremony was King Juan Carlos I of Spain. A self-guided tour giving a sequential history of the island includes a portable audio speaker that is available in various languages. It is currently one of the most visited sites in Santo Domingo.

They were built for Colonel Henry G. Wooldridge, to commemorate family members and other loved ones of his life, from 1892 until Wooldridge's death on May 30, 1899.AIC Wooldridge is the only one buried at the site.Wells p.7.1 The lot has been called \\"The Strange Procession Which Never Moves\\".Reigler History In 1892, Wooldridge lost the last of his sisters, leaving him with no immediate family; he was a lifelong bachelor. This prompted him to buy a lot at Maplewood Cemetery.Wells p.8.1 The monuments were gaining attention even in Wooldridge's lifetime, as represented in the November 7, 1897 issue of Republic. Stories told of the monuments include the Minnie statue actually representing a childhood sweetheart whose early death due to horse riding prompted Wooldridge's bachelorhood (family records say it was of a niece) and that Wooldridge was such a miser that money was buried with him in his tomb.Wells pp.8.2,8.3CoM Website Description Entrance/South view of the monuments The total area of the monuments are . All eighteen monuments face east, like most of the gravestones in Maplewood Cemetery. The most prominent is a life-size likeness of Wooldridge himself, a marble statue in the center of the site, made in Italy. Fourteen other monuments surrounding Wooldridge are made of limestone, and have more rigid poses. The largest of these represent Wooldridge on his horse, named \\"Fop\\". The other limestone statues are tall on bases, and represent family members. Behind these are replicas of a fox, a deer, and two hounds chasing them; the dogs are unidentified on the statue but represent Wooldridge's dogs \\"Towhead\\" and \\"Bob\\". The statue makers, who hailed from Mayfield and Paducah, Kentucky, never before or after had a more \\"complex\\" or \\"ambitious\\" project.Wells p.8.2 The female statues represent Wooldridge's mother Keziah, his sisters Minerva, Narcissa, and Susan, and his nieces Maud and Minnie. The male statues that are not of Wooldridge are of his brothers Alfred, John, Josiah, and W.H. There is no statue depicting Wooldridge's father. The fence around the lot was placed there by the Mayfield Masonic lodge, replacing the old iron fence.Wells p.7.2 Wooldridge was a Freemason. Modern times Northeast view, prior to January 2009 In September 1984 the monuments were featured on the TV show Ripley's Believe It or Not. To gain access to the monuments, one must go through another item on the National Register to get there, the Confederate Memorial Gates in Mayfield. On January 27, 2009, the monuments were damaged when a large tree in the cemetery fell as a result of an ice storm, breaking several of the heads. Only the statues of Wooldridge's sisters and a dog remained standing. City and County officials considered what to do to repair the damage to the monuments, one of the few tourist attractions for the city. Over the summer of 2010 all the monuments were restored on site by Monument Conservation Collaborative, a historic monument restoration firm based in Connecticut. On October 21, 2010 there was an official rededication of the monument as over a year's worth of repairs have been completed and all the statues are back in place.

He suggested that they were produced by the action of rivers, winds, and ice (continental), as well as by marine sedimentation. He also independently arrived at the theory of stoping as a mechanism for igneous intrusion. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1915. Life and career The Barrell family originated from a family that migrated from Suffolk in Britain to Boston in 1637. Joseph was born at New Providence on December 15, 1869. His father Henry Ferdinand and his mother Elizabeth n√©e Wisner, of Swiss descent, had owned a farm in Warwick, Orange County, New York before moving to a new farm in New Jersey. Henry Ferdinand was a trustee at the local public library and for the public school and Joseph, the fifth of nine children, grew up in a home surrounded by books. He took a great deal of interest in natural history and astronomy. Joseph went to the local public school until the age of sixteen. he then earned some money teaching at school and later joined Stevens Preparatory School at Hoboken before moving to Lehigh University in 1888. He graduated there and continued studies leading to an MS in 1897. He joined work in the University as an instructor in mining and metallurgy. Barrell taught Geology at Lehigh for three years. He spent a summer in Europe with Herbert E. Gregory and Charles Hyde Warren, travelling on foot, bicycle and third-class trains so as to be able to observe the land and geology with little interest in cities. He married Lena Hopper Bailey in 1902, and in 1903 he was invited by Yale University to develop a course in structural geology. Most of Barrell's key contributions to geology were possible during his time at Yale. Contributions to geology Some of Barrell's early work was in applied geology, dealing with the problems of measuring and estimating coal yields in the Lehigh Valley Coal Company (1894). He also worked with the United States Geological Survey to study the Elkhorn Mining District of Montana (1899). Some of the work done here became part of his doctoral dissertation. In 1900 he again worked with the USGS and produced a study \\"Geology of the Marysville Mining District, Montana: a Study of Igneous Intrusions and Contact Metamorphism.\\" The study of rock metamorphism became a major interest and in 1914 he wrote about the \\"Relations of Subjacent Igneous Invasions to Regional Metamorphism.\\" Another major advance he made was in the production of marine sediments and his ideas on how to determine ancient shore lines. Another area that he took an interest in was in the origin of the earth. He examined the theories of Chamberlin‚ÄìMoulton planetesimal hypothesis and questioned the idea that planetesimals grew by very gradual accretion of dust. Barrell suggested that most of the finer sediment on the surface of the earth or under the ocean had been produced by weathering. Barrell's approach to scientific questions was to collect all evidence, generate multiple hypotheses and argue through all hypotheses to look for consistency or the lack of it in explaining other observations. An example of his original thinking was in his examination of the evolution of air-breathing in fishes in the light of evidence for climatic and environmental changes.

Background Maxwell was born in Beauly near Inverness, Scotland, to the Honourable Bernard Constable-Maxwell (son of William Constable-Maxwell, 10th Lord Herries of Terregles) and the Honourable Alice Fraser (daughter of Simon Fraser, 13th Lord Lovat), both of whom were scions of notable Scottish recusant families. He was educated at Downside School. World War I service Maxwell was commissioned in the Lovat Scouts on 4 August 1914 and fought at Gallipoli. He then served in Egypt before returning to the UK, where he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in September 1916. Maxwell completed final pilot training at Central Flying School, Upavon and joined No. 56 Squadron in London Colney in March 1917. He was attached to 'A' Flight, commanded by Captain Albert Ball, flying SE5 aircraft. In April 1917, Maxwell's squadron was sent to France and he achieved a victory on his first patrol.Shores et.al. (1990), p. 262. Four days later he was hit by anti- aircraft fire and crashed unhurt. On 26 July 1917, Maxwell was appointed a flight commander, by which time he had been credited with eight victories. He was awarded the Military Cross on 18 October and was posted back to the UK. After instructing at the School of Aerial Fighting at Turnberry, he returned to No. 56 Squadron, where in six weeks he claimed six more victories. His confirmed 26 victories consisted of 12 enemy aircraft destroyed (including two shared wins), and 14 \\"out of control\\" victories, six of which were shared.

Rosenfield was born in Brookline, Massachusetts on April 28, 1933. He received a B.A. in biochemistry from Harvard College in 1955. In 1959, he graduated from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons with his M.D. degree.Segleken, Roger. \\"Dr. Allan Rosenfield, Women‚Äôs Health Advocate, Dies at 75\\", The New York Times, October 16, 2008. After receiving his medical degree, he worked in Thailand with the Population Council in the 1960s, in a country with a severe lack of physicians and a 3.3% annual population growth rate, providing advice to the ministry of public health on reproductive, maternal and child health issues. In the six years he spent in Thailand, he started a family and learned the Thai language. At the time, IUDs and birth control pills were only available by prescription from a doctor. This meant that the most effective types of birth control were not available to 99% of the Thailand population. The national family planning program Rosenfield helped develop trained auxiliary midwives to prescribe birth control. Thailand's annual population growth rate dropped to 0.8% by the year 2000. His work with the Population Council also took him to other countries in Asia and Africa, where he first realized the difficulties of lowering birthrates in poor countries. He was a leader in promoting the view that necessary steps for controlling population growth and achieving economic development were the provision of reproductive health programs and the raising of the status of women. Columbia University hired him in 1975 as a professor of public health and obstetrics and gynecology, and as director of the university's new Center for Population and Family Health. In this role, he focused the Center both on efforts in establishing community- based programs in the Upper Manhattan surrounding the school and in programs with a global reach. Until he was appointed dean of the Mailman School of Public Health in 1986, Rosenfield worked on a hands-on basis on the programs he had initiated, including the clinics for adolescent men and women, and clinics in local intermediate and high schools. In 1985, Rosenfield and Deborah Maine had the article Maternal Mortality ‚Äî A Neglected Tragedy: Where is the M in MCH? published in The Lancet, drawing attention to deaths of women in the third-world in pregnancy and childbirth. Efforts were made to improve access to health care for pregnant women in response to the article by international health groups. Rosenfield worked with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to create more than 85 \\"safe motherhood\\" programs worldwide. In 2000, at the International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa, Rosenfield followed up on his calls for improved access to maternal care, leading to the creation of the MTCT-Plus Initiative to help prevent mother-to-child transmission of AIDS. By the time of his death, the initiative had brought comprehensive health care to hundreds of thousands of women and infants throughout the world. Rosenfield was national chairman of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1985 and 1986. In 2006, he received the \\"Maggie\\" Award, highest honor of the Planned Parenthood Federation, in tribute to their founder, Margaret_Sanger. He also served as chairman of the Program Board of the American Foundation for AIDS Research. Rosenfield was an honorary member of the National Board of Public Health Examiners, an entity that provides the first and only core certification for public health professionals and graduates of CEPH-accredited institutions. The main building of the Mailman School of Public Health on West 168th Street was named for Rosenfield in 2006, with Columbia's president, Lee C. Bollinger, noting that \\"over the last three decades at Columbia, Allan has not only inspired and trained generations of public health leaders, he has helped define what a school of public health should be.\\" Rosenfield had been diagnosed with both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and myasthenia gravis in 2005, two separate diseases that affect motor nerve functions. After he received these diagnosis, tributes came from around the world, including a song dedication by Bono at a U2 concert.Perez-Pena, Richard. \\"Frail and Ill, but Still Focused on Global Health\\", The New York Times, June 12, 2006.

After the depredations of the war-time years and a devastating fire in the Abbey Theatre in 1951, the Radio √âireann Players' powerful weekly performances inspired interest in drama throughout the country. Their effect has been compared to an effort at national re-invention, in the same way that the national theatre fifty years earlier had been an attempt to redefine Irish identity.Eileen Morgan: Radio √âireann Players History Under Director Dr. T. J. Kiernan (husband of Delia Murphy, appointed 1935), Radio √âireann had already started broadcasting plays from the Abbey and Peacock theatres in Dublin and the Taibhdhearc in Galway. Roibeard √ì Farach√°in, a published poet, who set up the R√âP, became the first Radio √âireann Talks Officer in 1939 (his title changed to General Features Officer in 1945). In 1939 the station broadcast over 80 plays. During the Christmas holidays of 1942, √ì Farach√°in drew up his plans to ensure the radio drama, as well as other radio activities, should be served by professionals.Irish Times, 19 February 1976, page 9 He also fostered Irish writers such as Kate O'Brien, Edna O'Brien, James Plunkett and Francis MacManus, among many others. The formation of a full-time theatre company for a radio station was something new ‚Äî no English-speaking country possessed one. Many questions were asked, including in the D√°il and Department of Finance, before the station won approval to establish the company. Miche√°l √ì hAodha became the company's first producer and Roibe√°rd √ì Farach√°in with Ria Mooney of the Abbey recruited. All its members were from Ireland, many being native Irish speakers.Maurice Gorham, 40 Years of Irish Broadcasting, Talbot Press, 1976 Founding actors The founding actors (plus three who joined the following year) were: Tom Studley, George Greene, √âamonn Kelly, Joe Lynch, Arthur O'Sullivan, Pegg Monahan, Laurence O'Dea, Frank O'Dwyer, Christine Spencer, Ginette Waddell, Marie Mulvey, Gerard Healey, Leo Leyden, Charles McCarthy, Deirdre O'Meara, Una Collins, Seamus Forde, Charles Davis, Ronald Ibbs, Florence Lynch, Mair√≠n N√≠ Shuilleabh√°in, Joseph O'Dea, Christopher Casson, John Stephenson and Aiden Grennell. These \\"temporary, unestablished Civil Servants\\" started work at the studios on 18 August 1947. Dramatists Plays were written by writers such as Michael Farrell, Padraic Fallon, Benedict Kiely, Frank O'Connor and Se√°n √ì Faol√°in. This was a convenient income for these writers during the hard economic times of the 1940s and 1950s and also provided them a large audience. Another contributor was Brendan Behan, who made his debut with two plays for radio. Between plays, the players acted in radio variety programmes and read pieces on the radio as necessary. Prix Italia In 1961, the players performed The Weaver's Grave. Adapted and produced by M√≠che√°l √ì hAodha, it was written by Galway author Seamus O'Kelly, and won the coveted Prix Italia for Radio Drama. The cast was: Frank Dwyer (story-teller), Eamon Kelly (nailmaker), Thomas Studley (stone-breaker), Pegg Monahan (weaver's widow), Brendan Cauldwell (grave digger), Henry Comerford (grave digger), Arthur O'Sullivan (cooper), Maura O'Sullivan (weaver's daughter).Trinity College Dublin Film Research The players also won this award in 1965 with Dan Treston's \\"Piano in the River\\".

Early life and education  Quentin Fiore was born on February 12, 1920 in the Bronx, New York to Antonino, a tailor, and Bice (n√©e Bononi) Fiore and was raised in Brooklyn. Fiore was a self-taught designer. His visual education came from a short period of painting and drawing classes in New York in the late 1930s at the Art Students League of New York with George Grosz and, later, Hans Hoffmann. Fiore later studied at the \\"New Bauhaus\\" in Chicago. He was a conscientious objector during World War II along with two of his four brothers were assigned to camps around the country fighting forest fires and rescuing lost or injured skiers. After the war in 1946, Fiore married Jeanne DeWolfe Raseman. Career In the late 1940s, Fiore turned to graphic design and worked as an art director for Christian Dior and Bonwit Teller, later moving on to more corporate work for Ford Foundation, Bell Laboratories and RCA in the 1950s. Fiore is noted especially by his designs of the 1960s, where he mixed text and images, different sizes of type and other unconventional devices to create dynamic pages that reflected the tumultuous spirit of the time. In the words of critic Steven Heller, Fiore was \\"as anarchic as possible while still working within the constraints of bookmaking\\".Heller, Steven. Design Literacy: Understanding Graphic Design. Allworth Press, 1997 Of particular interest are his collaborations with media theorist Marshall McLuhan, such as The Medium is the Massage (1967). Initiated by Fiore, The Medium is the Masage didn't have a manuscript but was an amalgamation of McLuhan's previous works 1962 Gutenberg Galaxy and 1964 Understanding Media in an attempt to popularize McLuhan. The book has been described as the seed from which the idea that \\"consciousness can be affected by the knowing collision of verbal and visual information\\" sprouted. The style Fiore implemented in the book is a kinetic interpretation of the philosophy so that the complex ideas could be understandable to a visual audience. The typography within was at all different angles, superimposed on images, and meant to be read in a mirror. The book received mixed reviews with its disregard of typographic rules, while others thought it \\"it promoted illiteracy, encouraged drug use, it corrupted the morals of the American youth.\\" The initial print run by Bantam consisted of 5,000 paperback copies, with a hardbound edition from Random House. The book was wildly successful with subsequent print runs and translations in German, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese and Italian. Worldwide circulation was close to a million and McLuhan's largest-selling publication. The style was pushed further in DO IT!: Scenarios of the Revolution (1970), the controversial yippie manifesto by social activist Jerry Rubin. Rubin collected most of the material for the book, working with Fiore when he was available and was later described as an important political statement. In 1968 The Medium is the Massage was made into an LP (Columbia, CS 9501, CL 2701), combining readings of excerpts of the book with musical samples and original musical accompaniments. In 1999, a remastered version was released in CD format by SME Japan. He died in North Canaan, Connecticut on April 13, 2019 at the age of 99.

The closest major town is Monahans, Texas, and the closest limited-access highway ingress is Exit 86 on Interstate 20. Features Monahans Sandhills State Park is noted for the presence of sand dunes up to high. Although desert-like, the Monahans Sandhills are not a desert; they are a part of a semi-arid ecosystem (average annual rainfall ) characterized by the presence of both groundwater and relatively nutrient-poor windblown sand. The Shinoak (Quercus havardii) is a local climax shrub, an unusual type of oak tree which because of local conditions often achieves full growth of only in height. Most of a Shinoak's biomass exists in the form of a lengthy root system reaching down to groundwater. If a Monahans sand dune has become stabilized and has stopped blowing about in the wind, that is often because a small grove of Shinoaks have stabilized the dune with their extensive root systems. Despite the sterility of the landscape, various rodents are relatively common, and several packs of Sandhills coyotes feed upon them.\\"Monahans Sandhills State Park\\", Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, accessed November 1, 2008. Much of the Monahans Sandhills are privately owned property. The state of Texas is operating a 99-year lease with the Sealy-Smith Foundation for the ranch on which most of the land of the state park is located; the park opened to the public in 1957, and the state park has leasehold rights to this parcel of the sand hills until 2056. The Monahans Sandhills are part of the Permian Basin of hydrocarbon formations, and some oil production continues in and around the state park. Visitors practice several local forms of recreation at the Monahans Sandhills, such as sandboarding, 'sand football', 'sand surfing', and sand tobogganing. Geology The Monahans Sandhills consist of a sand deposits 70 miles long and 20 miles wide from Crane County, Texas to Andrews County, Texas. The Llano Estacado escarpment to the east is a barrier to further wind transport of sediment. The sand probably reached its greatest areal extent in the Late Pleistocene, 16,000 years before the present, with an earlier period of dune building 25,000 years before the present. The dunes consist of almost pure quartz grains with an average diameter of less than 0.22 mm, which is fairly uniform for all of the grains. Dune types include coppice, wind-shadow, Akle, Barchan, and parabolic. Winds from the southeast in the summer, from the northwest in the winter, and the southwest during spring, influence dune shape. These changes in wind directions change the shapes of the dunes and their position, but in general the dunes don't migrate, retaining their position and form when measured year to year.

There are two sand cays: North East Cay and South West Cay. The reefs were first seen on 27 of February 1823 by Lieutenant John Lihou aboard the vessel Zenobia and named after Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez. General Satellite View of Saumarez reefs (center) and the Swains reef (Left part of the Great Barrier Reef) and Frederick Reefs (right) Satellite view of Saumarez Reefs The Saumarez Reef is located on the Coral Sea Shelf, 330 km North East of Gladstone, Queensland and are thus one of the closer coral sea islands as they are only located 85 km to the east of the Great Barrier Reef Swain Reefs and 95 km to the southwest of the Frederick Reefs. The Saumarez Reef consists of three main reefs and many smaller reefs that form a large crescent-shaped formation, measuring 39 km across, that is open to the northwest. There are two sand cays: North East Cay and South West Cay. North East Cay (), is the northernmost of the Saumarez Reefs. It is a small sand cay lying near the Northern extremity of Saumarez Reefs. This 2.4m high cay, which is enclosed by a coral reef has an opening on the South Western side. A lighthouse (see infobox by side), is shown from the Northern edge of the cay. A clear channel, about 2.1 km wide, lies between Northeast Cay and the next reef to the South. South East Elbow () is located about 36 km SSW of Northeast Cay, forms the South Eastern extremity of Saumarez Reefs. , an American Liberty ship, is a conspicuous stranded wreck and lies about 9.4 km North East of South east Elbow. The Royal Australian Air Force F-111 aircraft used the wreck for target practice during the 1980s. Three small reefs lie between 900m to 7.6 km WNW of Southeast Elbow. These small reefs are separated from each other by unsurveyed channels with widths of 900m to 2.2 km. South West Cay (), enclosed by a reef, 10.8 km NW of Southeast Elbow, is the westernmost above-water part of the Saumarez Reefs, and is 2.4m high. There is a channel, 4 km wide between the cay and the reef SSE. History On 27 February 1823, Captain John Lihou, master of the 550-ton Zenobia of Calcutta, saw Sir JAMES SAUMAREZ' SHOAL (now Saumarez Reefs) and named the reef system after Saumarez. Lihou recorded the find as ‚Äúit is in latitude 21 degrees 40 minutes, and longitude 153 degrees 46 minutes by chronometer, which was found correct on making Sandy Cape a day or two afterwards. There is reason to suppose that many other reefs exist to the North-West of this position.‚ÄùVol. II has title: India directory, or, Directions for sailing to and from the East Indies, China, Australia, Cape of Good Hope, Brazil, and the interjacent ports... 4th ed. London, 1836 Lihou had just previously discovered Lihou Reef and Cays on 23 February 1823. Zenobia, was on passage from Manila to South America and Lihou had chosen a route through Torres Strait. This was the first occasion a ship was navigated through Torres Strait from west to east. It was also the first occasion a ship was navigated through the Coral Sea from Torres Strait, south-eastward to the southward of New Caledonia. The Zenobia entered Endeavour Strait in January 1823 and discovered a shallow port on the south coast of Prince of Wales Island, named Port Yarborough by Lihou and subsequently named Port Lihou. After a hazardous passage through the Strait, losing four anchors and a rudder, the ship departed the Great Barrier Reef via an opening near Murray Islands. On 23 February, Lihou Reefs were sighted and on the 27th of that month, other reefs were discovered and these Lihou named Sir James Saumarez Shoals (now Reef).http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/LIHOU/2001-02/0982849362 There is some thought that Saumarez Reefs could in fact be Midway Reef which had been sighted prior to the sailing of the Zenobia and described in an extract of a letter from Captain Carns, or the ship Neptune, to the Secretary of the Marine Board, describing the reef discovered between New Holland and New Guinea. > Thinking it a duty I owe for the benefit of Navigators, I beg leave to > acquaint you of the discovery I made between New Holland and New Guinea.

Known Shipwrecks on the Reef  =Noumea May 1880= 13 May 1880 the ‚Äúblackbirder‚Äù labour schooner Noumea, on her return trip from Santa Island to Mackay, with ninety nine Islanders, including eight women, struck on Saumarez reef, on May 13, and became a total wreck. Seven of the Islanders were drowned in swimming off from the wreck to the boats, but the remainder, together with the crew, were rescued by the steamer Leichhardt, sent to their assistance by the owner of the vessel The schooner Noumea was a vessel of some 144 tons approximately 100foot and built at George's River New South Wales in 1873 by Geo and Registered (64437) and owned by Mr Paxton, of Mackay, and was about six years old Her captain (RJ Belbin) was formerly in command of the Lady Darling, and has bad an extensive experience in the South Sea Island labour trade the vessel had, we behave, been recently purchased by Mr. Paxton for ¬£2600, and was on her first trading voyage between the South Sea Islands and Mackay She was insured in the Sydney office of the Australian Alliance Company Captain South, of the Keilawarra, from Brisbane, reported when he arrived at Sea Hill on the morning of the 18 May of having picked up a boat containing Captain Belbin and six white sailors in great distress of the schooner Noum√©a, which vessel had been wrecked on May 13 on Saumarez Reef, Captain South's report added that there were four white men (including the Government agent) and ninety-nine islanders still at the wreck and the reef, in need of immediate assistance, as they have no food to sustain them The captain left the vessel the day after she struck, and that, and as up to that time the crew had been unable to save any provisions from the wreck, it is feared the people left behind Mr WH Paxton, the owner of the Noum√©a, arranged with the ASN Company for the Steamer Leichhardt, to proceed to the wreck, and with instructions to bring the islanders from the wreck to Keppel Bay, where they are to be transshipped into the Tinonee for Mackay, which is their destinationThe Brisbane Courier Tuesday 18 May 1880 The steamer Leichhardt had arrived at Keppel Bay on 21 May 1880 from the scene of the wreck of the schooner Noumea with the whole of the European crew of the vessel and ninety- three South Sea Islanders. Other islanders were drowned while endeavouring to swim from the wreck to the boats the day after the vessel struck. Several of the rescued islanders are very weak, but there was no sickness amongst them. The islanders proceed to Mackay in the Tinonee. The Noum√©a was bilged and dismasted, and a total wreck on the north-east point of Saumarez Reef.The Brisbane Courier Friday 21 May 1880 The following narrative of one of the shipwrecked crew is Arthur William Munson, one of the crew of the captain's boat, gives us the. following short account of the wreck :-‚ÄúWe sailed about thirteen or fourteen days ago from the island of Santo, in the New Hebrides, bound for Mackay, with ninety-two South Sea Islanders on board as passengers. Everything went well till Thursday evening. I had finished my trick at the wheel about two hours before the accident; the course then was south-west half-west. At about half-past 7 in the evening the ship struck the reef, not heavily but grazing ; after that she struck heavier and then bounced right on to the reef high up. The captain at once got the starboard boat on deck, got her ready, and waited for daybreak. She was then launched over the starboard quarter with a crew consisting of the boatswain, four Kanakas, two black women, and a boy. The boat got through a break in the reef and lay under the lee of the reef on the other side. Then twenty-seven of the islanders took the water and swam through the reef to the boat ; but the boatswain could not take them all in, and I saw seven of them in the water when the boat left for the island or sandspit at the end of the reef. I am sure that of these at least five were drowned. In the meantime the port boat was launched over the starboard side. I was one of the crew. We took nine more islanders, including one woman, but could not succeed in landing her. I was swimming in the water nearly half-an-hour trying to land the woman, and at last they got her into the other boat. Only thirty-three islanders got out of the wreck, and when we came away in the captain's boat the rest of them were left on board. They had nothing to eat but bread damaged with salt water, and I don't know how they can have survived. The ship could not hold together long if it came on to blow. This is the second time within five months that I have been wrecked in these seas,\\" =SS Francis Preston Blair July 1945= SS Francis Preston Blair. American Liberty ship, 7196 tons.

The factory was built in 1839 by the Vienna-Raab Railway between the Vienna S√ºdbahnhof and Vienna Ostbahnhof and stocked with machinery, much of which was from England. The first locomotives and coaches were built in 1840 based on American prototypes. These were also the first railway vehicles to be built in Austria. The manufacture of railway vehicles was difficult because at that time in Austria there were still no iron foundries and none of the workers had the training for this type of work. One of the biggest influences on the development of locomotive construction in Austria was the first manager of the factory, John Haswell, who led it from 1840 to 1882. In 1855, the factory went into the ownership of the Staats-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft (State Railway Company) or StEG (full title: k.k. landesbefugte Maschinen-Fabrik in Wien der privilegirten √∂sterreichisch-ungarischen Staats-Eisenbahn- Gesellschaft), which had the factory expanded in size. Amongst the trail- blazing locomotives, which this factory produced, was the first six-coupled locomotive on the continent, the FAHRAFELD, the Semmering competition engine, VINDOBONA, and the first eight-coupled locomotive, WIEN-RAAB. The company runs a subsidiary today in Romania's Re≈üi≈£a. Until 1918, however only 7 steam engines were built there. Due mainly to the consequences of the First World War, there was only a low demand for locomotives within the reduced Austrian national territory. This was able to be compensated for a time by orders from abroad, nevertheless in 1930 the factory had to shut its gates.

The organization had branches in Alexandria and Cairo. The League conducted militant agitations in the Jewish neighbourhoods of Cairo.Kr√§mer, Gudrun. The Jews in Modern Egypt, 1914-1952. London: I.B. Tauris, 1989. pp. 180-181 The League was formed in the summer of 1946 by Jewish members of the underground communist Iskra movement. The founding Secretary of the Jewish Anti-Zionist League was Ezra Harari. Other members of the founding committee of the League were Marcel Israel, Edward Mataloun, Hanzin Kasfelt and Edward Levy. Immediately after the founding of the organization, the members of the founding committee were arrested. Communist-Zionist clashes in Dahir In April 1947 a violent clash erupted as between the League and Zionists, as disputes erupted over the election to the leadership in the Dahir Maccabi club. A slate of Zionist candidates won the election as result of manipulations and when the members of the Jewish Anti-Zionist League challenged the election outcome, the new club leadership called in police. In the clash, police forces sided with the Zionists and arrested the communists (considering the communists as a greater threat to public security than the Zionists). After the clash the communists reported the incident to the Wafdist newspaper Sawt al-Ummah. On May 24, 1947, conflict again erupted at the Dahir Maccabi club, as Zionists refused the communists access to the building to celebrate May Day. Two days later another clash erupted at the club between Zionists and Jewish communists. Following these events, the League issued an editorial stating that Jewish schools were used for Zionist propaganda and that sports clubs used for Zionist organizing rather than sports activities. Positions The ambitions of the Jewish Anti- Zionist League were twofold. On one hand, it sought to counter the Zionist influence within the Jewish community in Egypt. On the other hand, it sought to clarify to the Egyptian public that not all Jews were Zionists. In May 1947, the League had published a declaration, distributed in French and Arabic, condemning Zionism as a tool for British imperialism and called for Jewish-Arab unity. The latter part of the declaration read > Jewish Men! Jewish Women! Zionism wants to throw us into a dangerous and > hopeless adventure. Zionism contributes to making Palestine uninhabitable. > Zionism wants to isolate us from the Egyptian people. Zionism is the enemy > of the Jewish people. Down with Zionism! Long live the brotherhood of Jews > and Arabs! Long live the Egyptian people! The League argued that displaced European Jews should be given the possibility to return to their home countries or third country of their choice, rather than sending them to Palestine.It also claimed that only an independent democratic Palestine would be able to break the bonds of colonialism and safeguard the Jewish people. The organization condemned Zionist terrorist activity in Palestine. Banning In June 1947, the League was banned by the Egyptian Ministry for Social Affairs for \\"reasons of public security\\". Following the illegalization of the Jewish Anti-Zionist League, Harari founded the 'Forum Group'. The Forum Group was a Jewish anti-Zionist group within the Democratic Movement for National Liberation. According to contemporary British security reports, the Forum Group had a considerable following amongst the Jewish community in Cairo (Kr√§mer does however question the accuracy of this estimate, stating that the group had a rather limited impact).Beinin, Joel.

Vienna: C. Kr. Dvorna in Dr≈æavna Tiskarna, p. 107.) is a castle or mansion in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. Name The estate was attested in written sources in 1548 as Wokhauez (and as Bokaliz in 1580, and Wokhalez in 1697). The modern Slovene name (a feminine plural) was originally an accusative plural form of the surname Bokal. The origin of the surname is unknown. It could be the result of metathesis of the surname Kobal, derived from Italian Cavallo. It is also possible, but unlikely, that the name is derived from Slovene bok 'protected place, end of a hill, sharp slope', referring to the edge of Utik Hill. In the past the German name was Strobelhof, based on the name of the family that acquired the castle in the second half of the 17th century.Krajevni leksikon Dravske Banovine. 1937. Ljubljana: Zveza za tujski promet za Slovenijo, p. 340.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije. p. 315.  History  The castle stands next to the Ljubljana ring road, next to the Grada≈°ƒçica River. As early as the 12th century, the site was occupied by a fortification belonging to the noble Eghk family. From 1580 to the first half of the 17th century, the castle was owned by the Diennersberg family; from 1705 to 1809, both it and the surrounding estate belonged to the counts Lamberg. In that year, Janez Nepomuk Lamberg divided the estate, selling one half to Sigmund Pagliaruzzi. The other half, including the castle itself, remained a Lamberg holding until 1817, when it was sold to Jo≈æef Seunig. In 1899 the estate was reunited. As foreign-held property, the provisional government of Yugoslavia declared sequestration of the estate in 1919, lasting until 1924. After World War II, the castle was nationalized. It is currently rather badly decayed, and serves as an apartment building.

He was educated at Westminster School in London and became a King's Scholar before matriculating to Christ Church, Oxford, graduating B.A. in 1728 (M.A. in 1731), and B.D. and D.D. in 1742. Ordained deacon and priest in 1731, Johnson became Second Master of Westminster School (1733‚Äì1748) and held the rectory of Turweston (1741‚Äì1744), then concurrently the rectory of Berkhampstead (1743‚Äì1759) and of Mixbury (1744‚Äì1759), and the vicarage of Watford (1744‚Äì1759). In 1748 he was appointed a chaplain to King George II and canon residentiary of St. Paul's Cathedral. In 1752 he was consecrated Bishop of Gloucester but was quickly embroiled in a scandal involving allegations of Jacobitism. Christopher Fawcett had gossiped to Lord Ravensworth that Johnson, Andrew Stone and William Murray had drunk to the health of the Pretender in their youth. The allegations were brought all the way to the House of Lords and were subsequently thrown out. Johnson was translated to the see of Worcester in 1759 and made many alterations to Hartlebury Castle, the residence of the Bishops of Worcester, out of his own pocket. He was also a patron of Benjamin West, commissioning \\"The Return of the Prodigal Son\\". Johnson died in 1774 from a fall from his horse in Stall Street, Bath. There is a monument to him in Worcester Cathedral.

In the 28th year of his reign (227 BC), the State of Qin began its conquest of Yan, and his army approached Yishui (ÊòìÊ∞¥), modern-day Yi County, Hebei. Seeing the deep situation in which Yan was in, Crown Prince Dan, King Xi's son, sent an assassin Jing Ke, Qin Wuyang and others to kill the Qin king Ying Zheng, under the guise of presenting him with a map of Dukang (Áù£‰∫¢) and the severed head of the Qin general Huan Yi. As Jingke unrolled the map in front of the king, the dagger was revealed, but the assassination failed. This failure only helped to fuel the rage & determination of the king, and he increased the number of troops to conquer the state of Yan and order Wang Zhan to destroy Yan. The bulk of the Yan army was at the frozen Yishui River, Ji (Ëñä) fell the following year and the ruler, King Xi, fled to the Liaodong Commandery. To appease the King of Qin, King Xi had his own son executed by decapitation, and his head presented to the king. In 222 BC Liaodong fell as well, and Yan was totally conquered by Qin under the general Wang Ben (ÁéãË≥Å), the son of Wang Jian. King Xi of Yan was captured alive, and his fate is not known. Yan was the third last state to fall, and with its destruction the fates of the remaining two kingdoms were sealed.

The reef gained its name through the sinking of and Cato which were lost on Wreck Reefs. In 1803 Matthew Flinders embarked at Port Jackson as a passenger aboard Porpoise, which had been refitted to carry his collection of plants and papers. Cato and Bridgewater accompanied them. Eight days later (17 August) disaster stuck with Porpoise and Cato striking the uncharted reefs giving cause to the naming of the area. The area is protected as a historic wreck site. General Satellite View of Wreck Reefs The reef complex are approximately 100 km south east from Kenn Reefs, 150 km south east from the Saumarez Reefs and 120 km north nor west of Cato Island Wreck Reefs atoll consists of a narrow chain of reefs and cays which is approximately 25 km by 5 km west to east with an area of 75 km¬≤ and is open from the north. The sea always breaks over the cays. The coral reefs are situated on the top of a large shield volcano, produced by eruptions of the Tasmantid Seamount Chain. Cays found on the reefs include Bird Islet, West Islet and Porpoise Cay. Bird Islet , is a mound measuring some 500m by 250m and 6m high with a bare centre surrounded by a ring of herbage. It is the only one known to have any significant vegetation in the chain, and it has a reef 4.5 km. Porpoise Cay, is 275m long, 90m across and 3m high. It has a few low plants and lies 11 km west of Bird Islet in the centre of a shallow lagoon surrounded by a reef. The reef partially uncovers at low tide. West Islet , 1.8m high and bare, lies near the middle of the SE of three detached reefs at the west end of Wreck Reefs. A below-water reef surrounds West Islet.  History =Discovery= In 1803 when Matthew Flinders left Port Jackson for the last time in HMS Porpoise, in company with Cato and Bridgewater, he sailed by the Outer Route to Torres Strait. Wreck Reef, or rather the chain of reefs on which Porpoise and Cato were wrecked on the morning of 17 August (when Bridgewater left them to their fate), being on the eastern side of the barrier and about eighteen and a half miles in length and from a quarter to a mile and a half in breadth. It consists of patches of coral reef separated by navigable channels and is the home of seabirds and turtle. The eastern end of it, named, Flinders said, \\"not improperly,\\" Bird Islet, was found to be covered with coarse grass and shrubs. After striking, \\"Porpoise took a fearful heel over on her larboard beam ends,\\" fortunately falling towards the reef so that her people were saved. Cato, under Captain Park, struck about two cables length away and \\"fell on her broadside,\\" when her masts instantly disappeared. Several of the seamen were bruised against the coral rocks and three young lads drowned. One of the poor boys who had been shipwrecked no less than three or four times before‚Äîin every voyage that he had made‚Äîclung to a spar beside his captain and through the night bewailed that he \\"was the persecuted Jonas who carried misfortune wherever he went.\\" He lost his hold among the breakers, was swept away, and seen no more. The shipwrecked men gained the dry sand in the center of the reef and prepared their encampment. While searching for firewood that night they discovered a ship's spar and a piece of timber, rotten and worm-eaten, which, in the opinion of the master of Porpoise, was part of the stern-post of a ship of about 400 tons. Flinders presumed that it had belonged to one of Lap√©rouse's ships but the wrecks of La Boussole and Astrolabe were later discovered off Vanikoro in the Santa Cruz Islands. In more recent years timber as well as coins and other relics from a Spanish galleon have been recovered within the reefs, where they had been sheltered and preserved, perhaps embedded in some sandy shallow, so that it is not improbable that both sternpost and spar came from a long-lost Spanish vessel. Another theory is that the ship was an American whaler.The Sydney Morning Herald, 1 December 2009 Wreck may hold clue to nation's discovery Flinders and thirteen others including Captain Parker, rowed back to Sydney in the ship's cutter; this boat was given the name \\"Hope\\" and sailing on 26 August to Port Jackson. For the relief of the shipwrecked crews Governor King dispatched Rolla and two schooners, and Francis. Leaving Port Jackson at daylight on 21 September Flinders reached Wreck Reef eight days later, to the relieve of the shipwrecked crews. During his absence some of his old officers of Investigator‚Äîamong whom, besides Robert Fowler, were Samuel Flinders and John Franklin‚Äîsuperintended the building of a small, decked ship, which was named Resource. On being manned she was placed in charge of Denis Lacy, formerly master's mate of Investigator. The officers and men of Porpoise and Cato were distributed among the four ships. Those who preferred to return to Port Jackson sailed back in Francis and Resource; others, including Lieutenants Fowler and Samuel Flinders and John Franklin, sailed in Rolla to China, where they obtained passages to Europe. Matthew Flinders, with ten officers and seamen, embarked in Cumberland (the little schooner of twenty-nine ton lent by Governor King). Flinders, who was intending to proceed to England, was forced to call at Mauritius, where the French detained him for seven and a half years.Early Explorers in Australia =Guano Mining= On 27 October 1862, the British government granted an exclusive concession to exploit the guano on Lady Elliot Island, Wreck Reefs, Swain Reefs, Raine Island, Bramble Cay, Brampton Shoal, and Pilgrim IslandPilgrim Island is not located, possibly somewhere off Western Australia to the Anglo-Australian Guano Company organised by the whaler, Dr. W.L.

Kevin Barry features prominently in Frank McCourt's novel Angela's Ashes and in the 1999 movie adaptation of the book.  Lyrics  As the author is unknown there is no definitive version, they can be sung with various verses added or omitted, or without the chorus, or other minor variations. This is one version: :In Mountjoy jail one Monday morning :High upon the gallows tree, :Kevin Barry gave his young life :For the cause of liberty. :Just a lad of eighteen summers,Since Barry was born in January 1902, he had in fact lived through 19 summers when he was executed. The writer, it is assumed, was alluding to his age of 18 years :Still there's no one can deny, :As he walked to death that morning, :He proudly held his head on high. ;Chorus :Shoot me like an Irish soldier. :Do not hang me like a dog, :For I fought to free old Ireland :On that still September morn. :All around the little bakery :Where we fought them hand to hand, :Shoot me like an Irish soldier, :For I fought to free Ireland :Just before he faced the hangman, :In his dreary prison cell,The suggestion that Barry's torture took place in prison shortly before he was hanged is inaccurate. In fact, the ill treatment took place several weeks before his execution, at the North Dublin Union shortly after his arrest on 20 September 1920. :British soldiers tortured Barry, :Just because he would not tell. :The names of his brave comrades, :And other things they wished to know. :Turn informer or we'll kill you :Kevin Barry answered \\"No\\". :Proudly standing to attention :While he bade his last farewell :To his broken hearted mother :Whose grief no one can tell. :For the cause he proudly cherished :This sad parting had to be :Then to death walked softly smiling :That old Ireland might be free. :Another martyr for old Ireland, :Another murder for the crown, :Whose brutal laws may kill the Irish, :But can't keep their spirit down. :Lads like Barry are no cowards. :From the foe they will not fly. :Lads like Barry will free Ireland, :For her sake they'll live and die.

Biography Chester was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on January 27, 1869. He was the author of such popular works such as Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford and Five Thousand an Hour: How Johnny Gamble Won the Heiress that were made into silent films within his lifetime. His success in selling stories to The Saturday Evening Post and leaving his position with the Cincinnati Enquirer and moving to New York City to write fiction was the impetus for James Bearsley Hendryx to buy a typewriter and try his hand at writing fiction. Chester's first wife, Elizabeth Chester, divorced George in 1911, using the evidence that he was living at Gainsborough Studios in London with Lillian Josephine Chester. Elizabeth filed for divorced, and George and Lillian married while they were in Europe after hearing that the divorce was finalized. However, Elizabeth had only been granted an interlocutory decree, which made the divorce not final and therefore made his subsequent marriage to Lillian controversial. George and Lillian worked on several stories and plays together. George and Lillian only directed one film together, The Son of Wallingford (1921), which has been lost. Chester died on February 26, 1924, of a heart attack in his New York City home.

Desbutal was marketed as an antidepressant as well as a medication for the treatment of obesity, narcolepsy, parkinsonism, and alcoholism, although it was commonly also prescribed off-label for miscellaneous ailments. It was highly abused and is no longer manufactured.  Dosage forms  Desbutal was designed as round biphasic tablets, with the two active ingredients visibly partitioned between the two faces of the tablet to control their rates of dissolution and achieve a more preferable pharmacokinetic profile. Each tablet featured a yellow half which contained an immediate-release formulation of pentobarbital sodium, and a blue half which contained a sustained-release formulation of methamphetamine hydrochloride (Desoxyn Gradumet). The three dosages of tablets that were manufactured included 5mg, 10mg, and 15mg of methamphetamine hydrochloride with 30mg, 60mg, and 90mg of pentobarbital sodium, respectively. Abuse of Desbutal often involved physical separation of these two halves by sawing with a razor or fingernails, followed by the consumption of each active ingredient independently rather than concurrently. Typically abusers would ingest the blue half containing methamphetamine for stimulation and wakefulness, followed by future ingestion of the yellow half containing pentobarbital as a hypnotic for counteracting stimulant-induced insomnia whenever sleep was desired.  Overdose  A Desbutal overdose typically becomes life-threatening as a result of acute toxicity from pentobarbital poisoning, since the oral median lethal dose (LD50) of pentobarbital sodium is reached significantly sooner than the oral LD50 of methamphetamine hydrochloride when consumed as dosage units with the mass ratio present in Desbutal. Barbiturate overdose is a medical emergency which was treated with immediate gastric lavage, mechanical ventilation, and intermittent intravenous bolus administration of multiple different drugs, since no selective barbiturate binding site receptor antagonists were clinically available as an antidote, and dosages were dependent on individual patient response. These drugs often included picrotoxin, amiphenazole (Daptazile), bemegride (Megimide), and methamphetamine sulfate (Methedrine) in dosages sometimes exceeding 250mg over the first 24 hour period of being admitted into an intensive care unit (ICU). While a quantitative relationship between the blood levels of barbiturate derivatives and the depression of the central nervous system (CNS) had become established by researchers in 1955, they also emphasized that the accurate correlation of these factors is complicated by the presence of tolerance to the drug, intercurrent disease and senility, as well as the concurrent administration of other noxious substances.  Regulations  Desbutal is no longer manufactured since withdrawal of its marketing approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1973 as part of a mass recall of all obesity combination drugs containing a CNS stimulant, often with a CNS depressant. The recall also included all existing stocks of parenteral amphetamines based on the FDA's contention that these products have such a great drug abuse potential that they cannot be used safely. Although the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) had already reduced the amphetamine aggregate production quota (APQ) for pharmaceutical manufacturers by approximately 90% throughout the prior two years, these combination drugs had rapidly grown in popularity throughout the two preceding decades. Many pharmaceutical manufacturers were vigorously competing for market shares by continuously developing new combinations and dosage formulations, and at the time of the 1973 recall, the estimated annual distribution of these pills was equivalent to 480 million dosage units of Obetrol 10mg tablets.  Medical uses  The medical justification for these combination drugs was that the CNS stimulant elevates mood and suppresses appetite, while the CNS depressant mitigates many of the adverse effects of the CNS stimulant without simultaneously reducing its therapeutic benefits. Typically the CNS stimulant within these combination drugs was racemic amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, or methamphetamine as various single or mixed salts, and phenmetrazine hydrochloride (Preludin) was also marketed albeit less frequently. Typically the CNS depressant within these combination drugs was a single barbiturate salt, especially pentobarbital sodium and sodium amobarbital (Amytal), although meprobamate (Miltown), a minor tranquilizer, and methaqualone hydrochloride (Quaalude), a non-barbiturate sedative were also sometimes used. Some less common combination drug formulations included a CNS stimulant combined with multiple vitamins and minerals, a first generation antipsychotic (Eskatrol was popular), or a first generation antihistamine (Obocell-TF). Other formulations utilized amphetamines, barbiturates, and meprobamate for their ability to potentiate analgesia by combining them with analgesics such as phenacetin and aspirin.

It was broadcast on November 17, 2008 in the United States on the Fox Network.http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings.aspx?id=20081031fox04 In this episode, the team finally breaks into the Scylla room in the Company headquarters. Plot Michael Scofield and the team race against time trying to devise a plan to steal Scylla, as the Company will move Scylla to an unknown location on that same day. Michael, however, continues to suffer from his deteriorating health, and the team is forced to carry out the plan as Michael reluctantly agrees to have surgery that day. To reach Scylla, they must break through a concrete wall and a glass wall, without making any noise, changing the room temperature, or touching the floor. Meanwhile, Gretchen dresses up to seduce the General and steal the sixth card that is necessary to decode Scylla. Having personally trained her, the General realizes that she is lying and threatens to kill her. Gretchen pleads with him, mentioning her daughter, whose father is supposedly the General. The General lets Gretchen go but tells her if he ever sees her again, he'll kill her. T-Bag suddenly shows reluctance in continuing with the Scylla business, as he now has a respectable job and a comfortable life as Cole Pfeiffer. However, he forces himself to refuse his boss to go on a complementary cruise trip, as it leaves that same day. Mr. Xing barges into GATE again and demands Scylla, but Gretchen again promises him to deliver and asks for his help. Even though Gretchen fails to steal the sixth card, Michael and his team proceed to steal Scylla. Michael, from a sense of guilt of leaving others in peril, changes his mind and postpones his surgery, joining the team after getting some injections from Sara. Via the underground from GATE to the Company headquarters, Michael, Lincoln, Sucre, and Mahone reach the concrete wall. They manage to break through with slow drilling, some umbrellas to catch the falling debris inside, and electromagnets to disrupt the steel linings inside the wall so that it can be dug silently. Trishanne, T-Bag's assistant, listens to a call between T-Bag and Gretchen and alerts Agent Self. Don Self and Trishanne raid the address mentioned in the call, but end up in the hands of Mr. Xing after they are set up by Gretchen and T-Bag. Gretchen and T-Bag prepare to take Scylla for themselves once Michael and his team successfully retrieve Scylla. In silence, Sucre assembles a ladder above the floor, one rung at a time, to traverse the alarm-rigged floor and reach the glass wall. To fool the temperature sensor, he releases liquid nitrogen inside the room. Sucre loses balance when the ladder shakes, but manages to grab the falling liquid nitrogen container and makes it back up. After tense moments, Sucre finishes the ladder to the glass wall. Although suffering from occasional pain, Michael crosses the ladder and makes a hole on the glass. As he approaches Scylla and places his hands upon it, a sensor beneath Scylla goes off, warning the General who calls for security and comes after Scylla himself.

Zinsser (March 21, 1868 - January 20, 1956) was a resident of Hastings-on-Hudson, New York who established a chemical plant on the waterfront of the Hudson River called Zinsser & Company, which synthesized organic chemicals. The Zinsser plant was as one of the establishments contracted to produce mustard gas during the First World War. Zinsser was born in New York City to German immigrants parents. His brother was Hans Zinsser, the celebrated bacteriologist at Columbia and Harvard who became best known for authoring the best-selling book Rats, Lice and History in 1935. Zinsser completed a degree in chemistry at Columbia University, and then further studied at Louvain University in Belgium, and G√∂ttingen University and Heidelberg University in Germany where he received a Ph.D. in 1891. At Heidelberg University he worked three years under Viktor Meyer, who first synthesized mustard gas in 1886.https://archive.org/stream/WorldWar2Novdec2014/WorldWarIi2014-11-12_djvu.txt In 1897 he established Zinsser & Company, Inc., whose president and chief chemist he was and enter the emerging field of synthetic organic chemicals. The first product was called \\"Hastings Spirits\\", a refined wood alcohol or methanol. He married Emma Sharman and they had three children, they raised them in a well-to-do German-speaking household. (The son John attended Harvard University, and was a chemist and associated with his father for some years, then later became vice chairman of the board of Merck & Co. of Rahway, New Jersey and president of Sharp & Dohme Inc. of Philadelphia and was on the board of directors of the investment bank JP Morgan in New York during the 1940s.

Ellen married John J. McCloy, the chief lawyer for the Rockefeller and the ‚ÄúSeven Sisters‚Äù interests, member of the Warren Commission, and advisor to nine US presidents.) The Zinsser plant attracted Hungarians, Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, and Russians who immigrated for work. By the start of World War I the Zinsser's plant had grown to 30 buildings. In 1917, the U.S. government established a mustard gas on the property - the production was at capacity of 75 tons mustard gas per day by the time the armistice was signed. During the war, 200 National Guardsmen were stationed in Hastings because of the security interest of the chemical plants. At the same time Zinsser also served as a colonel in the US Army as assistant to William Walker, commander of the Chemical Warfare Service's Edgewood Arsenal in Baltimore, Maryland, where the army operated a mustard gas plant.Scott Christianson: The Last Gasp: The Rise and Fall of the American Gas Chamber.

Life Lewis Clarke was born in Madison County, Kentucky, seven miles from Richmond, in 1812. Depending on the source, Clarke's birth year is listed as 1812 or 1815. He is best known for his slave narrative, Narrative of the Sufferings of Lewis Clarke, During a Captivity of More Than Twenty-Five Years, Among the Algerines of Kentucky, One of the So Called Christian States of North America, dictated by himself. In the beginning of his narrative, Clarke expounds upon his slave and plantation-owning grandfather, Samuel Campbell. Campbell raped a female slave named Mary who, according to Clarke, was half white. They had one daughter, Letitia Campbell before Campbell married. Clarke's father, Daniel Clarke, was a Scottish weaver who came to America for the American Revolution. He had married once before but his wife died and left him two sons. He fought as a Minuteman at the Battle of Bunker Hill and remained active until the end of the war effort. Campbell promised Clarke's father that Letitia would be free in his will, and with this promise, Clarke's father married her around 1800. Clarke's father died when Clarke was either 10 or 12 years old after receiving a devastating wound leaving him disabled, possibly paralyzed. Even when promised freedom, Letitia did not receive it and stayed enslaved as Clarke claims Campbell's heirs destroyed the will. During this time, Clarke fell into the hands of his grandfather's children, being the property of William and Betsy Benson, who treated him brutally. After Clarke learned he would be sold in New Orleans, Clarke fled to Ohio and across Lake Erie into Canada in 1841.Digital History On arriving in Canada: He published Narrative of the Sufferings of Lewis Clarke in 1845, and an extended edition which included the experiences of his brother Milton, in 1846. He also traveled about giving lectures on his experiences as a slave. It was during one of these trips that he met Harriet Beecher Stowe, who was so impressed by Clarke and his story that she would base the character George Harris in her novel Uncle Tom's Cabin on Clarke. While Clarke was not traveling, he lived in Warren County, Pennsylvania, before moving over the New York border to the town of Busti, New York, in 1850, where he worked as a farm hand on the farm of David Storum, the father-in-law of African-American abolitionist Jermain Wesley Loguen.1850 Federal Census of Population for the town of Busti, Chautauqua County, New York, p. 32 After the end of the Civil War, he returned South and died on December 16, 1897 in Louisville, Kentucky. His body lay in state at the Kentucky State Capitol on order of Governor William Bradley, and he was subsequently buried in Westwood Cemetery in Oberlin, Ohio.

The exams were administered in the Spring of each school year. The goal was for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics, by the Spring of 2014. The tests focused on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The Science exam included content in science, technology, ecology and the environmental studies. The mathematics exam included: algebra I, algebra II, geometry and trigonometry. The standards were first published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education. In 2013, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania changed its high school assessments to the Keystone Exams in Algebra 1, Reading/literature and Biology1.

Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics, IPEDS, 2009 Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. Graduation requirements To graduate from the Susquenita School District a student is required to earn 27 credits. Beginning with the class of 2012, students are required to earn the following: English 4 credits, Math 4 credits, Science 4 credits, Social Studies 4 credits, Physical Education 1.5 credits, Health 0.5 credits, and 9 electives. By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.Pennsylvania State Board of Education, Proposed changes to Chapter 4, May 10, 2012 By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2019, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the Keystone Exams. The exam is given at the end of the course. Keystone Exams replace the PSSAs for 11th grade. Students have several opportunities to pass the exam. Schools are mandated to provide targeted assistance to help the student be successful. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. Students identified as having special needs and qualifying for an Individual Educational Program (IEP) may graduate by meeting the requirements of their IEP. School district superintendents have the discretion to graduate up to 10% of pupils who do not pass the exams or project. The original intent was to gradually add seven more exams including civics and geometry. In 2017, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation that eliminated developing any more Keystone Exams in other subjects.PA General Assembly, Act 6 of 2017, June 21, 2017Pennsylvania Department of Education, State Board of Education Finalizes Adoption of Pennsylvania Common Core State Academic Standards and High School Graduation Requirements, March 14, 2013 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams.

In December 2012, the district administration reported that 303 pupils, or 17.2% of the district's pupils, received special education services, with 48.8% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In 2010, Susquenita School District administration reported that 351 pupils, or 18.7% of the district's pupils, received special education services, with 56% of those identified as having a specific learning disability. In 2009, the Susquenita School District administration reported that 361 pupils, or 18% of the district's pupils, received special education services. In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full-day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full-day kindergarten would be recouped by districts in lower special education costs. Susquenita School District has seen a decline in the number of identified students. It has continued to experience higher costs for special education student services.Susquenita School Board, General Fund Budget 2016-17, June 2016 In compliance with state and federal laws, the district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Department of Special Education. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provides public school districts with a statewide total of $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Pennsylvania Department of Education Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, November 11, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Baruch Kintisch Education Law Center, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 Susquenita School District received a $1,331,925 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-2012, 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding was provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education Funding 2011-2012 Fiscal Year, 2011 Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The district administration must apply for this added funding. *2014-15, Susquenita School District received an increase to $1,353,806 in special education funding from the state.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 *2016-17 school year, Susquenita School District received a 1.2% increase in state special education funding to $1,395,629.Pennsylvania Department of Education, BEF, Special Education Funding, RTL Grants 2016-17, July 2016 In 2013, the state's Special Education Funding Reform Commission provided a report on the state of funding for special education in the Commonwealth. Funding for special education programs is borne largely on a local basis at 60%, with the state contributing $1 billion or 30% and the federal government providing 10% of the funding. =Gifted education= The Susquenita School District Administration reported that 81 or 4.19% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum through a push in model with the gifted instructor in the classroom with the regular instructor. This approach permits such specialized instructional strategies as tiered assignments, curriculum compacting, flexible grouping, learning stations, independent projects and independent contracts. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to honors and advanced placement courses, and dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Bullying policy While there were 35 school safety incidents in 2011, Susquenita School District Administration reported there were no incidents of bullying in the district. Susquenita School District Administration reported there were 3 incidents of bullying in the district in 2009. The Susquenita School Board has provided the district's antibully/cyberbullying policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE).

Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days‚Äô public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In June 2017, Susquenita School Board approved a new contract with the local teacher's union. It awards a 4% raise in 2017-18, a 3% raise in 2018-19 and 2.5% raises in both of the final two years.

The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget includes $5,354,629,000 for the 2011-2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation. This amount is a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted State appropriation for 2010-2011. The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011-12. Districts experienced a reduction in funding, due to the loss of federal stimulus funding, which ended in 2011. In 2010, Susquenita School District reported that 558 pupils received a free or reduced-price lunch due to the family meeting the federal poverty level. For the 2010‚Äì11 school year, the state provided Susquenita School District with a 2% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $8,404,930. Among Perry County school districts, the highest state funding increase went to West Perry School District at 5.14%. One hundred fifty school districts in Pennsylvania received a base 2% increase in state basic education funding. The highest increase of state funding in 2010‚Äì11 was 23.65% which went to Kennett Consolidated School District of Chester County. The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where each public school district received at least the same amount as it received the prior school year, even when enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district receives was determined by then Governor Edward G. Rendell and then Secretary of Education, Gerald Zahorchak through the allocation set in the state budget proposal made in February each year. This was the second year of Governor Rendell's plan to have the state fund some school districts at a much higher rate than others. In the 2009‚Äì10 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 6.39% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $8,240,128. This was the highest funding increase in Perry County. The district also received supplemental funding for: Title I (federal funding for low-income students), for district size, a poverty supplement from the Commonwealth and more. The highest state funding increase was 22.31% to Muhlenberg School District in Berks County. The state Basic Education funding to the district in 2008‚Äì09 was $7,745,178.40. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 508 students received free or reduced-price lunches due to low family income in the 2007‚Äì2008 school year.Pennsylvania Department of Education Funding Report by LEA 2009‚Äì10 October 2009. All Pennsylvania school districts also receive additional funding from the state through several other funding allocations, including Reimbursement of Charter School Expenditures; Special Education Funding; Secondary Career & Technical Education Subsidy; PA Accountability Grants; and low achieving schools were eligible for Educational Assistance Program Funding. Plus all Pennsylvania school districts receive federal dollars for various programs including: Special Education funding and Title I funding for children from low-income families. In 2010, Pennsylvania spent over $24 billion for public education - local, state and federal dollars combined. Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, and before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, Susquenita School District applied for and received $435,193 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The Susquenita School District used the funding to provide reduced class size K-3rd (3rd year) and for full-day kindergarten (1st year ‚Äì 2009). Ready to Learn grant Beginning in the 2014-2015 budget, the State funded a new Ready to Learn Grant for public schools. A total of $100 million is allocated through a formula to districts based on the number of students, level of poverty of community as calculated by its market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) and the number of English language learners. Ready to Learn Block Grant funds may be used by the districts for: school safety; Ready by 3 early childhood intervention programs; individualized learning programs; and science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) programs. Susquenita School District received $254,344 in Ready to Learn Grant dollars in addition to State Basic Education funding, Special Education funding, reimbursement for Social Security payments for employees and other state grants, where the district must apply to receive. In 2016, Susquenita received $300,005 in Ready to Learn state grant dollars. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Classrooms for the Future Program, 2007 The program was funded from 2006 through 2009. Susquenita School District received funding in 2008 of $268,410.Pennsylvania Auditor General Office, Classrooms for the Future Grants 2007‚Äì08, 2008 In 2009, Susquenita School District received $48,973. Among the public school districts in Perry County, the highest award was given to West Perry School District which received $361,599. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell as part of the 2009-10 state budget. Education Assistance grant Susquenita School Administration did not apply for the state's Education Assistance Grant. The state's EAP funding provides for the continuing support of tutoring services and other programs to address the academic needs of eligible students. Funds are available to eligible school districts and full-time career and technology centers (CTC) in which one or more schools have failed to meet at least one academic performance target, as provided for in Section 1512-C of the Pennsylvania Public School Code.PATTAN, Pennsylvania School Tutoring - Education Assistance Program 2010-2011, July 2010 Environmental Education Grant The Environmental Education Grant Program was established by the Environmental Education Act of 1993, which mandates that 5 percent of all pollution fines and penalties collected annually by the Department of Environmental Protection be set aside for environmental education. In 2012, Susquenita School District was awarded $6,418.DEP Awards Grants to Promote Environmental Education and Stewardship, PA Department of Environmental Protection Press Release, April 20, 2012. Grant recipients must use the funding for various initiatives, including environmental field trips for students, implementing environmental education curriculum at schools.

One other Perry County public school district received the Literacy grant funding and another Perry County District receives PreK Counts funding. Nor did Susquenita School District participate in the 2012 and 2013 Pennsylvania Hybrid Learning Grants. =Federal grants= Susquenita School District received an extra $1,598,172 in ARRA ‚Äì Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students.Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Perry County ARRA FUNDING, 2010 This was in addition to all regular, annual state and federal funding. The funding was limited to the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school years.Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, School stimulus money, March 12, 2009 Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the Pennsylvania Senate Education Committee, the Governor and the Pennsylvania School Board Association, to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top Grant Susquenita School District officials chose to not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district hundreds of thousands of additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. School Improvement Grant In the summer of 2011, the Susquenita School District administration did not apply for School Improvement Grant funding, from the federal government (over $9.9 million available). Susquenita Elementary School was eligible for funding, due to low academic achievement. The grant stipulates the funds be used for improving student achievement using one of four federally dictated strategies. The strategies are: transformation, turnaround, restart with new faculty and administration or closure of failing schools. Transformation calls for a change in faculty and administration evaluations, mandated training in proven teaching techniques and rigorous curriculum change that focuses on student achievement. The Pennsylvania Education Secretary awarded $66 Million to reform Pennsylvania's lowest-achieving schools For 2010-2011, Susquenita School District did not apply for a School Improvement Grant. It was eligible for funding due to the chronic, low achievement at the elementary school. In 2010, Pennsylvania received $141 million from the federal Department of Education, to turn around its worst-performing schools. The funds were disbursed via a competitive grant program. The Pennsylvania Department of Education has identified 200 Pennsylvania schools as \\"persistently lowest- achieving,\\" making them eligible for this special funding. Pennsylvania required low performing schools to apply or provide documentation about why they had not applied. The funds must be used, by the district, to turn around schools in one of four ways: school closure, restart - close the school and reopen it as a charter school. The other two options involve firing the principal. One would require at least half the faculty in a chronically poor performing school be dismissed. The second involves intensive teacher training coupled with strong curriculum revision or a longer school day.PA Department of Education School Improvement Federal Funds for School Reforms to Boost Student Achievement Awardees 2010 Title II grants The Federal government provides annual grants to schools to be used to improve the quality of teacher instructions to pupils. The goal is to provide each child in public schools with ‚ÄúHigh Quality‚Äù teachers and principals as defined by the state. The funds are sent to the state Department of Education which distributes them to each school district and charter school. Beginning in 2002, the federal funding committed to Title II was $3,175,000,000. Public school district administrations must apply to the state annually for the Title II funds. In 2012-13, Susquenita School District received $64,605 in federal Title II funding.PDE, Title IIA egrants 2012-13, 2012 In 2014-15, Susquenita School District applied for and received $61,596.PDE, Title IIA egrants 2014-15, 2014 English language learners grant The Federal government provides annual grants to schools to assist in educating immigrant children and children who are identified as limited English proficient. Upon registering for school a language survey is done for all new enrollment pupils, typically in kindergarten or preschool. They identify the primary language spoken at home. This data is collected and submitted to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, which in turn notifies the federal government.PDE, English As A Second Language (ESL), 2015 In 2012-13, Susquenita School District received $1,901 in Title III funding for English language learners. For 2014-15, Susquenita School District received $2,281 in Title III funding.PDE, Title III Grant Allocations 2014-15, 2014 =Common Cents initiative= The school board elected to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars.Common Cents program ‚Äì Making Every Dollar Count After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates, in 2017-18, were increased by the school board to: Reed Township in Dauphin County, at 23.392 mills. Perry County - 12.97 mills. Property taxes for district residents, in Perry County, were set at 12.1300 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service-related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Act 511 Tax Report, 2004 Susquenita School District includes municipalities in two different counties, each county has different rates of property tax assessment, necessitating a state board equalization of the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. In 2014, it was revealed that the district's business manager had been manipulating the tax assessment numbers for years in favor of greater revenue for the district. Unlike other states, under Pennsylvania state tax policy, natural gas and oil pipelines are exempted from property taxes. There are a plethora of gas pipelines in the district due to marcellus shale gas development. Pipeline companies prohibit development within the 100-foot-wide right-of-way, there by limiting future development options for the landowner. This limits future potential property tax revenues for the school district, by constraining future land development. *2016-17 - Reed Township in Dauphin County, at 22.8100 mills.

Perry County is ranked 538th of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income. In Dauphin County, property owners pay 3.48% of their income in property taxes which ranks 382nd in the USA.Tax-rates.org., County Property Taxes 2012, 2012 Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.

Eligibility to participate is set by the Susquenita School Board, in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA). The district is noncompliant with state law, due to failing to post its Interscholastic Athletic Opportunities Disclosure Form on its website. Susquenita School District is a member of the Mid-Penn Conference for sports and District III of PIAA. Susquenita School Board has ordered random drug testing of all pupils who are participating in student activities as well as those students who drive to school. The policy was a source of controversy when it became public that the school had tested a 5th grader who belonged to the Middle Honor Society 3 times in one school year. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those home schooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. The drama department was nominated for two Hershey Apollo awards (best pit band and best play) and won the award for 2011 best pit band. =Sports= According to Pennsylvania's Safety in Youth Sports Act, all sports coaches, paid and volunteer, are required to annually complete the Concussion Management Certification Training and present the certification before coaching.

Opened in 1975, the mall originally included four anchor stores and more than one hundred tenants, but lost three of those anchors (JCPenney, Belk and Rich's-Macy's) in the mid-2000s. In May 2009, the mall was completely closed as Sears and the rest of the stores in the mall closed. The mall was managed by General Growth Properties of Chicago, Illinois at the time of its closure. History Century Plaza opened in 1975 on the eastern side of Birmingham, Alabama, on U. S. Route 78 (Crestwood Blvd.) near Interstate 20, across from the existing Eastwood Mall. The mall's original anchor stores included Sears (which opened in 1974), Rich's, Loveman's of Alabama and JCPenney. Loveman's later was replaced by Pizitz, which in turn became McRae's in 1987. Rich's was dual-branded as Rich's-Macy's in 2003 when Macy's acquired the Rich's chain. The Rich's-Macy's store at Century Plaza, however, closed after only one year in operation and was never rechristened as \\"Macy's\\". A Piccadilly Cafeteria in the mall also closed that same year. When plans were announced to demolish Eastwood Mall across the street in 2004, two of the mall's tenants (Books-A-Million and Parisian) had announced preliminary plans to relocate to Century Plaza, with the latter taking over the McRae's space. McRae's was eventually converted to Belk in 2006 when the chain was acquired, but closed later that same year. JCPenney also closed in 2006, and many inline tenants began to close as well. In February 2009, it was announced that Sears, the last remaining anchor, would close its store by May 31. Mall closing Century Plaza closed at the end of business on May 31, 2009. At the time of its closing, fewer than 40 stores, including Foot Locker, Champs Sports, Finish Line and RadioShack remained open in the mall. General Growth Properties announced that Sears would remain open through June 14 to complete the liquidation of the store. In December 2017, the Howard Hughes Corporation sold the mall for $3 million to Lumpkin Development, a real estate company based in Pelham, Alabama. Lumpkin said that the Sears store would be converted into a self-storage facility, and that the rest of the mall was available for rent. In May 2020, it was reported that the site was being considered for development as a last-mile delivery center by Amazon. References External links Century Plaza archived website from 2004.

She was introduced in 2009 in Resident Evil 5 in which she is a native African operative of an anti-bioterrorism group and the new partner of the series' veteran Chris Redfield. Sheva is controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI) when playing with a single player, and is controlled by a second player in the game's cooperative mode. Designed to symbolize \\"the bond of partnership\\" within the game, the character's physical design was modeled off Australian actress Michelle Van Der Water, while her voice acting and motion capture were performed by American actress Karen Dyer. The character was met with mostly positive reception from video game journalists, who praised her strength and attractiveness, though her AI in- game received mixed to negative reviews. The character's depiction did, however, receive criticism from several sources for adhering to racial and gendered stereotypes. Sheva has not returned for any further installments of the series. Design and portrayal Sheva Alomar's character was designed during the early development phase of Resident Evil 5, with her designer Yosuke Yamagata calling her a \\"new major protagonist\\" who symbolizes the theme of \\"the bonds of partnership\\". Her face and story background changed several times while she underwent many redesigns and re-imagining as developers searched for the right look to combine the qualities of \\"feminine attraction\\" and the \\"strength of a fighting woman\\". Rejected concepts for Sheva included her being either a civilian, a guerrilla, or a military commander. Her character model was based on Australian actress Michelle Van Der Water, but her voice acting and motion capture were performed by American actress Karen Dyer. Dyer, in her first major game role of this kind, went through weeks of firearms training for the job, learning with both hands as Sheva is left- handed. She described her character as more acrobatic and agile than her partner Chris Redfield, and as \\"very passionate and youthful\\", adding she had an \\"emotional attachment\\" to her mission as she wants to save her people. Sheva appears in the game wearing a form-fitting purple singlet, beige pants and knee-high boots. She also carries a tactical belt and pistol holster, and wears leather forearm guards and traditional African jewellery. Alternate costumes are a staple within the Resident Evil series that let players dress playable characters in \\"silly, cool, and even embarrassing\\" outfits; the series also has a reputation for making their alternate costumes for women sexualised. Sheva's alternate costumes are a \\"Clubbin'\\" outfit consisting of a gold lam√© bikini, micro-miniskirt and blonde wig, and a \\"Tribal\\" outfit consisting of a leopard print bikini and tribal body paint. Appearances Sheva made her first and only appearance in Resident Evil 5. According to the character's backstory, her parents died when she was eight years old in an apparent factory accident and she was taken in by her uncle. Eventually, Sheva ran away and was found by a truck driver who was part of a rebel militia group. She later joined the group and soon learned that the factory accident her parents had died in was actually a test of a bio-organic weapon (BOW) by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella Corporation. With the help of the local government, Umbrella destroyed Sheva's village and its inhabitants after the test was complete. When Sheva was 15, she was contacted by U.S. operatives to sabotage Umbrella's attempt to sell a BOW. With Sheva's help, the deal was stopped and she was offered a chance to start a new life in America. Sheva accepted, was speaking fluent English within months and enrolled at a university two years later. After graduation, her benefactor recruited her to join the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA). While Umbrella had dissolved years before this, Sheva's hatred of Umbrella and others like them led her to join. She was assigned to a unit for eight months of training, in which she excelled and was chosen to become an agent assigned to the BSAA's West African department. When BSAA agent Chris Redfield is sent to intercept a black market BOW sale in the fictional African country Kijuju, Sheva is assigned to be his partner and guide. In Resident Evil 5, the primary player controls Chris, whom Sheva follows throughout the game as an ally controlled by artificial intelligence (AI). In the game's co-operative gameplay mode, a second player will control Sheva. When the game has been completed once, there is an option to make Sheva the primary character. During the events of the game, Sheva and Chris stop the Tricell corporation, who were continuing Umbrella's work, from infecting the world with a new BOW. In the end, they kill the series' villain Albert Wesker. Pre-order bonuses for Resident Evil 5 included a sand globe of Sheva and Redfield. Various action figures of the character have been released by the National Entertainment Collectibles Association, Hot Toys, Square Enix, and SomaliCraft. Karen Dyer posed as Alomar for a 2009 calendar she made available to download from her website. Reception Reception of Sheva by video game journalists was mostly positive. She was added to several lists that rank characters by their sex appeal. In 2008, GameDaily staff said that though they were yet to play Resident Evil 5, they were \\"already enamored with its glamorous starlet\\"; the following year, they cited Alomar as among the strongest female characters in gaming. In 2010, Dave Meikleham of GamesRadar included her partnership with Chris among gaming's \\"most violent double acts\\", and PlayStation: The Official Magazine opined she was intelligent and strong in addition to being beautiful, adding that her inclusion was \\"probably the highlight\\" of the game and awarding her \\"Tribal\\" costume 2009's Outfit of the Year award. In 2012, Complex ranked her among the best black characters in video games. GamesRadar's Matt Cundy said that unlike other characters in the series such as Jill Valentine and Ada Wong, Sheva's primary uniform was both less sexualised and more practical for fighting, describing her as \\"the absolute antithesis of vulnerable ... a walking fortress that is equal parts kick-ass and intimidating feminine sexuality,\\" and Lisa Foiles of The Escapist praised Sheva among other characters for having a hairstyle that is practical for fighting, unlike many video game heroines. In 2017, Inverse's Jessica Famularo ranked her as the eighth best character in the series. Several reviewers criticized Sheva's AI. IGN's Jesse Schedeen called her a \\"walking bag of useless\\", and \\"just dumb as a rock when it comes to fighting zombies\\", while Portal Play Game considered her performance to be extremely annoying. Dan Whitehead from Eurogamer described Sheva's abilities as a bit hit-or-miss, saying that in a game where ammunition is scarce it was often frustrating watching her miss her targets. In 2012, PLAY included her among the most unintentionally annoying PlayStation characters, citing the AI issues. Ryan Geddes from IGN was more mixed, describing her performance as fair and saying her limitations were on par with other AI characters at the time, while IGN's Chris Reed included her among most useful sidekicks in video games, saying that unlike many AI characters, she was quick to offer assistance and skilled at getting out of the way when the player was moving or shooting. Several sources have criticized Sheva's depiction for adhering to both gender and racial stereotypes. Andre Brock from Games and Culture opined that Sheva was a \\"videogame equivalent of Pocahontas: a woman of color coerced into 'guiding' White explorers across a foreign land\\", and also said that her alternate costumes \\"make it clear that she is window-dressing; a sexualized mule\\". Anita Sarkeesian said the tribal outfit was particularly disconcerting, as it combined sexualizing a female character \\"with the racist tradition of exotifying women of color\\". Writing for the Digital Games Research Association, Hanli Geyser and Pippa Tshabalala noted that the first shot of Sheva in the game is a close up of her buttocks, immediately objectifying and characterising her. Eurogamer's Whitehead said that Sheva \\"neatly fits the approved Hollywood model of the light-skinned black heroine\\"; Geyser and Tshabalala similarly stated that her skin tone, outfit and job all conform to Western ideals. Writing for The Philosophy of Computer Games Conference, Sabine Harrer and Martin Pichlmair said that Sheva was given the role of a \\"decorative side character\\", also stating that \\"gendered and racialized hierarchies\\" exist between Sheva and Chris; Chris's character is placed in charge of Sheva's resources, said to be reminiscent of \\"an abusive heteronormative relationship\\".

There is no precise data about the first Lithuanians in Rochester. Antanas Sabalis in his 1983 bookSv. Jurgio Parapija - St. George's Parish and the Lithuanians of Rochester by Antanas Sabalis, Rochester, NY, 1983 about St. George's Roman Catholic Lithuanian Parish and the Rochester Lithuanians quotes Mykolas Ventis remembering that the first Lithuanians came to Rochester about 1890. By the end of 1905, there were some 400 Lithuanians in Rochester, many of them young men having escaped the hardships of the coal mines of Pennsylvania. Visiting Lithuanian priests from other cities held Mass in Lithuanian in the Holy Redeemer Church or the parish's Concordia Hall. German Pastor Jacob Staub encouraged local Lithuanian men to seek a permanent Lithuanian priest. Before the Easter in 1905, they invited Father Kazimieras Urbonaviƒçius to come. To appear more favorably, they also organized the Saints Peter and Paul Society with 28 initial members.Saints Peter and Paul Society - Juozapas Bartaseviƒçius It was at the September 9, 1906, meeting of the Saints Peter and Paul Society that Adomas Butrimas proposed the idea of establishing a Lithuanian Roman Catholic Parish. All 200 members in attendance agreed. At the October 14 meeting of the Saints Peter and Paul Society, 134 members pledged their support and decided that members would go house-to-house collecting funds for the new parish. At the next meeting on November 13, the members settled on the name of Saint George, the Martyr, for their new parish. At the October 14 meeting 461 potential parishioners were enrolled; by April 1909 there were 690. On January 23, 1908, St. George's Roman Catholic Church (Lithuanians) was incorporated.Lithuanian Parishes of the Roman Catholic Diocese in America Building construction At the April 14, 1907, parish meeting the committee to oversee the construction of the church and parish hall was named. Their proposal to buy the vacant land between Hudson, Weeger, and Dudley Streets was readily accepted. Each person at the meeting pledged an initial 25 dollar donation. At the March 8, 1908, parish meeting $25,000 dollars were allocated to build a stone church. Although at first there were many stumbling blocks because of the hard financial situation of the time, Bishop Thomas Hickey dedicated the new church-hall-school building, costing about $18,000, on December 11, 1910. The success of the building project was in most part due to the energy of Father Juozas Kasakaitis, who became the first pastor of St. George Church after finishing his studies at Saint Bernard's Seminary in spring 1910. In 1925 a two-story rectory was finished. By January 1927, it became clear to all members that the parish was ready to build a church which would be separate from the hall and school. When Pastor Kasakaitis died in 1930, the new Pastor, Jonas Bak≈°ys, took on the building project of the new church. Finally, on August 11, 1935, the new church, built to seat 400 members, was dedicated with great celebrations by Archbishop Edward Mooney and Bishop Teofilius Matulionis. The old church was converted to a parish hall and opened with a concert and play on November 17, 1935. Parish school In 1929 a primary school was opened to house four grades. Father Jonas Baksys later expanded it to eight grades and invited Lithuanian Franciscan Sisters from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to staff it. The parish built them a convent on the church grounds. By 1930 the school had grown to 164 students, and the first graduating class included the present Pastor of Saint George, Father Dominic Mockeviƒçius. The school closed in 1965. Parish organizations The parish became a home of many organizations. The Sts. Peter and Paul Society, whose members took the initiative to build the church, was incorporated in 1905 and was disbanded by the 1990s. Various other societies were established: the Holy Mary Society (1908‚Äì1976), the Fraternity of Saint George the Soldier (1908‚Äì1965), Chapter 103 of the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Alliance of America (1908‚Äì1982), Saint Cecilia's Choir (1911‚Äì1940s), Chapter 93 of Knights of Lithuania (1917‚Äì1954), and others. The Grand Duke Gediminas Club, established in 1903, was the first and most controversial society. By 1912 they already had a building with a bar on the first floor and facilities for meetings on the second floor. The organization was left-leaning and did not participate in parish activities or support Lithuanian independence. In 1967 the association had 137 members. The parish supported Lithuania's goals of independence. For example, during the Lithuanian Days in 1916 Tautos Fondas raised $1,600 for the independence movement; in March 1918, 13 delegates representing Saint George parish and six other organizations took part in the Lithuanian Convention at New York's Madison Square Garden asking President Woodrow Wilson to recognize Lithuania's independence. Parish priests At the beginning Rochester's Lithuanians were served by priests from other towns. During the parish incorporation, the Rector was Father Vincentas Vizgirda, who signed the parish incorporation document, but in May returned to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, and Father Juozas Krasnickas, who left in October. The professors of Saint Bernard's Seminary then took the parish under their care. The most frequent guests were Father J. F. Goggin, who officiated at Mass, and Seminarian Juozas Kasakaitis, who gave the sermons in Lithuanian. When Father Kasakaitis graduated in spring 1909, he was assigned as the first pastor of Saint George Roman Catholic Lithuanian Church. Kasakaitis died of cancer in 1930. He was replaced by Father Jonas Bak≈°ys, alumni of Saint Bernard's Seminary, who worked in Hartford and Waterbury. Bak≈°ys finished building the present Saint George's church and expanded the parish's grammar school to eight grades. Father Bak≈°ys organized relief for the Lithuanian refugees of World War II: he organized clothing donations and raised $10,000 in June 1947 under the auspices of the local chapter of United Lithuanian Relief Fund. When immigration rules permitted Lithuanian refugees to come to the United States, Bak≈°ys himself sponsored many families and found jobs for many of the new arrivals. Because of failing health, Father Bak≈°ys handed over the pastorate to Pranas Valukeviƒçius in 1956. Valukeviƒçius was born and raised in Rochester and worked the assistant parish priest in 1938‚Äì1950. During his term he remodeled the church, hall, and school. To make the parish financially more secure, he started the bingo games. He was also one of the founders in 1950 of the Lithuanian Radio Program, which is still in existence today. Before his death of cancer in 1972, Father Valukeviƒçius worked to find a Lithuanian pastor. The Lithuanian Franciscan Fathers responded to his search and in 1972 took over the leadership of Saint George's Parish. Fathers Rafaelis ≈†akalys, Bernardinas Grauslys, and Augustinas Simanaviƒçius presided over the parish only for a few months. Father Jonas Dyburys was appointed in 1973, but died of a heart attack in 1976. He was replaced by father Justinas Va≈°kys, a distinguished personality. Having studied theology, philosophy, history, and pedagogy in Kaunas, Lithuania, and in Austria, in 1939 Va≈°kys was appointed Principal of the Franciscan High School in Kretinga, Lithuania. When in 1940 the Soviets occupied Lithuania, the Franciscan hierarchy sent Va≈°kys to America to find a place that would house the Lithuanian Franciscan Friars now scattered throughout the world. He found a place for a monastery in Kennebunk, Maine, which is still in existence. There, he was responsible for laying the foundations for the Lithuanian newspaper Darbininkas and the magazines Aidai and ≈†v. Pranci≈°kaus Varpelis. Because of failing health, Father Va≈°kys had to resign as pastor in June 1991 and went to live in a nursing home, run by the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Putnam, Connecticut, where he died in 1994. With him ended the Franciscan leadership at Saint George's. The Diocese made Father Ralph Fraats the temporary administrator of Saint George. One year later, in 1992, brothers Charles and Dominic Mockeviƒçius returned from retirement to serve Saint George's parishioners. They both had graduated from the Saint George's Grammar School, studied at Saint Andrew and Saint Bernard's Seminaries. In 1997 St. George's celebrated Charles' 80th Birthday and the 50th anniversary of his priesthood. Father Charles died in 2002. Father Dominic's 60th anniversary of priesthood was celebrated here in the summer of 2008. With help from the Honorary Consul of Lithuania Rimantas ƒåesonis and Bishop Eugenijus Bartulis, Kazimieras Gra≈æulis and Gintaras Antanas Jonikas came from Lithuania to assist Father Dominic. =Pastors= * 1910-1930 Juozas Kasakaitis * 1930-1956 Jonas Bak≈°ys * 1956-1972 Pranas/Frank Valukeviƒçius * 1972 Rafaelis ≈†akalys * 1972 Bernardinas Grauslys * 1972-1973 Augustinas Simanaviƒçius * 1973-1976 Jonas Dyburys * 1976-1991 Justinas Va≈°kys * 1991-1992 Ralph Fraats * 1992-1994 Kazimieras/Charles Mockeviƒçius *1994‚Äì2010 Domininkas/Dominic Mockeviƒçius =Assistant priests= * to 1910 Juozas Kasakaitis * 1938-1950 Pranas/Frank Valukeviƒçius * 1950-1956 Domininkas/Dominic Mockeviƒçius * 1962-1965 Antanas Raƒçaitis * 1965-1971 Liudas Janu≈°ka * 1970s Antanas Petrauskas * 1972-1973 Eugenijus Jurgutis * 1976 Gabrielius Baltru≈°aitis * 1980s Tadas Degutis * 1994-2002 Kazimieras/Charles Mockeviƒçius * 2004-2006 Kazimieras Gra≈æulis * 1990, 2006-2009 Gintaras Antanas Jonikas Post-World War II parish organizations In 1942 a Rochester Chapter of the Lithuanian-American Council (LAC) was established and merged with a chapter of the United Lithuanian Relief Fund of America in 1943. The chapter organized observances of the Lithuanian Independence Day, anti-Soviet demonstrations, cultural events, Lithuanian Days with car parades in the city, and raised funds for Lithuania's struggle for freedom and for needy Lithuanians. The chapter officers have, for a number of years, selected people for recognition and award of Lithuanian Foundation medals for achievement in the field of culture. Beginning in 1971, ten such awards were bestowed.JAV LB Penki de≈°imtmeƒçiai 1951-2002, Vilnius, 2003 Especially during 1987‚Äì1994 their focus was on supporting the struggle for Lithuania's independence. Worthy of notice at that time was the walk on foot from Rochester to Washington, DC by activist Paulius Klimas to publicize the case of jailed Lithuanian dissident Petras Gra≈æulis, who eventually regained his freedom and is now member of the Lithuanian Parliament. His brother, Rev. Kazimieras Gra≈æulis, served as Rev. Dominic Mockeviƒçius' assistant in 2004‚Äì2006. With the arrival of new immigrants the dearth of candidates was overcome and a new slate of officers elected in 2002. On their agenda, among other things, were efforts to support Lithuania's membership in NATO,Speaker: Mindaugas Butkus, Consul General of Lithuania, from New York and to participate in the long-term effort by the Eastman School of Music and the Episcopal Diocese to install at Christ Church a copy of the organ from Holy Ghost Church in Vilnius, Lithuania.A \\"Pipe Dream\\" No Longer: First global heritage project between the U.S. and LithuaniaThe Eastman-Rochester Organ Initiative: A Global Organ Project for the 21st Century (The inaugural concert of this organ took place in October 2008.)

The choir has sung at Mass and in concerts, at all North American Lithuanian Song Festivals as well as those in Lithuania in 1994, 1998 and 2002. 1949 also saw the start of a Lithuanian Folk Dance group. It debuted at the traditional Lithuanian Day at Schuetzen Park. Later the group was named Lazdynas (Hazel) while a spin-off veteran group was named Lazdyno ≈†aknys (Roots of Hazel). The group participated in folk dance festivals in North America as well as in Lithuania, including appearance in Vatican for the Pope in 1983. The last appearance for Lazdynas appears to have been the showing of its veterans group at the dance festival in Toronto in 2000.Pluralism Project at Harvard University: Church Profile #1 In 1984 a second Lithuanian folk dance group named ≈Ωilvinas appeared. The group performed in Atlanta in 1985 and at the Folk Dance Festival in Hamilton, Ontario in 1988. The group disbanded in 1991. Lithuanian Scouts and Ateitis (Future, a Catholic student organization) were established in 1949, a chapter of Ramovƒó (organization of Lithuanian Army veterans) and Lithuanian radio program Dainos Aidas (Echo of Song)Lithuanian Radio & TV Programs in the USA were organized in 1950. First aired on February 16, 1950, Dainos Aidas still broadcasts at 9 AM every Sunday for a half-hour on 90.1 FM. The program was started on a commercial basis, but soon a Radio Club was organized for raising funds through dues and contributions. Dainos Aidas won the Lithuanian-American Community's Cultural Council's award for 2002.Dainos Aidas wins Lithuanian- American Community Cultural Council Award In 1951 members of Ateitis organized a Lithuanian book stall in the church hall. During 1951‚Äì1973, 10,323 books were sold. Members of Ateitis also launched a drama circle, which staged plays locally and in other cities like Philadelphia, New York, Cleveland, Toronto, Montreal. The youth group took one to the 3rd Drama Festival in Chicago in 1974. Music group Sutartinƒó performed from 1977 to 1981 in cities like Cleveland, Baltimore, Detroit, Toronto. After about eight years of performance, a pop music band Slibinas (Dragon) split up in 1977. A Lithuanian Saturday school was established in 1961. Instruction was to take place Saturday mornings 32 weeks and subsequently ran all Saturday morning until after noon. The school, named for Mindaugas Tomonis, lasted until 1993. During its first 20 years the school graduated 56 students. In 2005 another Lithuanian school, The Edward Gervickas Lithuanian Heritage School, opened in Rochester. The school currently has 18 students, 4 to 15 years of age.Lithuanian Educational Council of the USA Balt≈≥ Vaikai (Children of the Balts) was organized in 2005 and currently has 28 members (22 adults and 6 children), mostly recently arrived immigrants. The goals of Balt≈≥ Vaikai are to foster Lithuanian culture, customs, and traditions. Since their beginning, Balt≈≥ Vaikai have organized many events of their own and helped other organizations with their events. The Parish Council requested to organize a Parish Future Committee in fall 2005. The purpose was to assess the future of St. George Parish and make recommendations with regards to aging clergy, financial support, declining parish enrollment, deteriorating buildings. The committee was successful in securing the services of Father Gintaras Antanas Jonikas who arrived in Rochester in the summer of 2006 from Lithuania to assist Father Dominic Mockevicius. An outgrowth of the Parish Future Committee was the Lithuanian Heritage Society of Rochester, an umbrella organization with over 100 members. The Society's main purpose is to continue and promote Lithuanian culture and traditions in the Rochester area. One of its principal goals is to secure a facility that is separate from the St. George Parish buildings.

Background Risler, dedicatee of Bourr√©e fantasque \\"Bourr√©e fantasque\\" is dedicated to the pianist √âdouard Risler (1873‚Äì1929), who in fact did not play the work in public until after the composer's death. The first public performance was given by (Mme Henry Jossic, 1868‚Äì1905) on 7 January 1893 at the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Musique in Paris.Delage R. Emmanuel Chabrier. Fayard, Paris, 1999. It was composed around April 1891, following a visit to his native Auvergne the previous summer, when Chabrier's health was deteriorating.Delage R. Emmanuel Chabrier. Fayard, Paris, 1999, points out that just prior to composition he and Jean Richepin had thought about collaborating on 'an op√©ra comique auvergnat'. According to Alfred Cortot it is \\"one of the most exciting and original works in the whole literature of French piano music\\".Myers R. Emmanuel Chabrier and his circle. J M Dent and Sons, London, 1973.

Emmanuel Chabrier and his circle. J M Dent and Sons, London, 1973; quoting Cortot The manuscript is at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. The music In a letter to Risler dated 12 May 1891, Chabrier wrote, \\"I have made you a little piano piece which I think is quite amusing and in which I have counted about 113 different sonorities. Let us see how you will make this one shine! It should be bright and crazy!\\" The precision of the notation in each bar, dynamics from ppp to tutta forza, accents, pedal indications, bear witness to his wish to obtain an exceptional tonal variety and richness.Delage R. Emmanuel Chabrier. Fayard, Paris, 1999. Delage then quotes Cortot on the ground-breaking aspects of the piece. The piece lasts six to seven minutes. In 2/4 time, the piece opens with the repeated notes of the main theme (Tr√®s anim√© et avec beaucoup d'entrain) hammered out in the middle register of the piano, and put through its paces. The middle section changes mood with a freely-modulating caressing melody (molto espressivo) before the original theme returns pp, worked in combination with the second theme, until the main bourr√©e theme \\"rampages from top to bottom of the keyboard subjected to increasing elaboration and bravura treatment\\". In relation to the \\"Bourr√©e fantasque\\" Charles Koechlin affirmed that Chabrier was the forerunner of modern French composers through the boldness of his writing technique, use of certain chord progressions, and use of modal atmosphere and ancient modes ‚Äì which is never artificial or imitative, but a natural means of poetic expression.In a lecture in San Diego, quoted in: Orledge R.

Its name derives from the Slovene word bistra 'clear'. History The predecessor of the current Slovenska Bistrica castle is first mentioned in 1265, when emperor Rudolf gave it and the adjoining town in fief to count (from 1286 duke of Carinthia) Meinhard of Gorizia. In 1313, it passed to the Habsburgs, who leased the castle and town to the noble house of Walsee. After 1368, the lordship was obtained by the counts of Celje; after their extinction in 1456 it reverted to the ducal lands. In 1587, the town and castle were bought by Hans Vetter; in 1717 the castle only was sold to the counts Attems, who retained until the end of World War II, when it was nationalized. During the Attems tenure, the castle was the home of the painter and historian Maria Attems. Architecture The mansion is located on the northwest side of the mediaeval old town of Slovenska Bistrica. Rebuilt into a renaissance mansion in the 17th century, the foundations of the current building adjoin one of the defensive towers of its fortified predecessor. The layout is trapezoidal, with a turret at each corner and an arcaded inner courtyard. The entire building is surrounded with a moat, now dry. The surrounding estate was planted with rare trees, now neglected, and a hornbeam tree row. The Attems decorated the interior in the early 18th century; the castle features a painted staircase, a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and a richly appointed great hall.

This device is often called a \\"barretter\\" because of its similarity to the barretter used for detection of radio signals. The modern successor to the iron‚Äìhydrogen resistor is the current source. Operation When the current increases, the temperature will increase. The higher temperature leads to a higher electrical resistance, opposing the increase in current. The hydrogen gas protects the iron against oxidation and also enhances the effect, since the solubility of hydrogen in iron increases as temperature increases, resulting in higher resistance. Uses Iron‚Äìhydrogen resistors were used in the early vacuum tube systems in series with the tube heaters, to stabilize the heater circuit current against fluctuating supply voltage. In 1930s Europe it was popular to combine them in the same glass envelope with an NTC-type thermistor made of UO2 until 1936, known as Urdox resistor and acting as an inrush current limiter for the series heater strings of domestic AC/DC tube radios.

Scorpion was sloop- rigged and could also be propelled by oars. She probably was built under contract for the U.S. Navy in 1812 for service during the War of 1812. Lieutenant Edmond P. Kennedy assumed command of the ship at Norfolk, Virginia, in September 1812. On 29 March 1813, Scorpion was ordered to the Potomac River to serve in the Potomac Flotilla, which was to protect Washington, D.C. Since Lieutenant Kennedy was to command the flotilla, Lieutenant George C. Read became the commanding officer of Scorpion on 4 May 1813. On 18 February 1814, Scorpion reported for duty at Baltimore, Maryland, in Commodore Joshua Barney's Chesapeake Bay Flotilla and became Commodore Barney's flagship. On 24 May 1814, with Major William B. Barney, Commodore Barney's son, acting as captain of Scorpion, the flotilla sailed for the lower Chesapeake Bay in an attempt to stop the British from advancing toward Washington. On 1 June 1814, a British squadron was encountered at the mouth of the Patuxent River, and the flotilla was forced to retreat up the river. During the following weeks, Commodore Barney's flotilla engaged the British on several occasions and was able to delay the British advance. Finally, on 21 August 1814, facing overwhelming odds, Barney was forced to retreat and landed his men at Pig Point, near Upper Marlboro, Maryland. Barney and his men then marched to assist in the defense of Washington, leaving Scorpion and the rest of the flotilla to be burned by a detail of men under Lieutenant Solomon Frazier to prevent the capture of the ships by the British. For more than a century, the remains of some of the flotilla were visible in the Patuxent River mud. But by the mid-20th century they had vanished, thanks to salvage hunters and the river silt. In 1979, marine researchers explored the Pig Point waters and located a shipwreck they thought to be Scorpion. Later, U.S. Navy and State of Maryland divers began exploring the site.Vogel, Steve.

Jean released her debut single, \\"Just a Guy\\", on September 14, 2010. She also starred in the web-series Talent produced by Alloy TV on YouTube as Harper, a musician who travels to Los Angeles in search of fame.

Fish bone also includes the bony, delicate parts of the skeleton of bony fish, such as ribs and fin rays, but especially the ossification of connective tissue lying transversely inclined backwards to the ribs between the muscle segments and having no contact with the spine. Not all fish have fish bones in this sense; for instance, eels and anglerfish do not. There are several series of fish bones: Epineuralia, Epicentralia, Epipleuralia and Myorhabdoi. Fish bones support the core muscles without inhibiting their motility. In cuisine, fish bones are usually removed and not eaten. Because of their slim, tapered shape they may get caught in the esophagus and cause pain and will have to be removed by a doctor. Fish bones have been used to bioremediate lead from contaminated soil.

The Global South is making increasingly significant contributions to global development. The economic and geopolitical relevance of many countries has grown. In the past, south-south cooperation focused on sharing knowledge and building capacities, but the countries of the Global South and new financial institutions have recently also become increasingly active in development finance. History The formation of SSC can be traced to the Asian‚ÄìAfrican Conference that took place in Bandung, Indonesia, in 1955 which is also known as the Bandung Conference. The conference has been largely regarded as a milestone for SSC cooperation. Indonesia's president at that time, Sukarno, referred to it as \\"the first intercontinental conference of coloured peoples in the history of mankind.\\" Despite Sukarno's opening address about the conference, there had been gatherings similar to the Bandung conference in the past. Nevertheless the Bandung Conference was distinctive and facilitated the formation of SSC because it was the first time that the countries in attendance were no longer colonies of distant European powers. President Sukarno also famously remarked at the conference that \\"Now we are free, sovereign, and independent. We are again masters in our own house. We do not need to go to other continents to confer.\\" The conference was sponsored by India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma, and Indonesia and was attended by these 29 independent countries: Afghanistan, Burma, Cambodia, Ceylon, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gold Coast, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Jordan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Sudan, Thailand, Turkey, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, State of Vietnam, and the Kingdom of Yemen. Each country supported the continuation of decolonization efforts happening in both Africa and Asia at the time. Although many countries disagreed on some issues, the Bandung Conference \\"provided the first major instance of the post-colonial countries' collective resistance to Western Dominance in International relations.\\" In 1978, the United Nations established the Unit for South‚ÄìSouth Cooperation to promote South‚ÄìSouth trade and collaboration within its agencies. However, the idea of South‚ÄìSouth cooperation only started to influence the field of development in the late 1990s. Due to the geographical spectrum, activities are known as South America-Africa (ASA) cooperation as well as, in the Asia-Pacific region, South‚ÄìSouth cooperation.Shikha Jha and Peter McCawley, South-South Economic Linkages: An Overview, ADB Economics Working Paper Series, No 270, August 2011. The ASA cooperation has so far held two summits. The first summit was held in Abuja, Nigeria, in 2006 where 53 delegates from Africa and 12 from South America attended. The second and most recent one was held on the Margarita Island in Venezuela in Sept 2009 where 49 heads of states from Africa and 12 heads of states from South America attended.Africa, South America strengthen ties South‚ÄìSouth cooperation has been successful in decreasing dependence on the aid programs of developed countries and in creating a shift in the international balance of power. Direction The Leaders of South American and African countries hope that this cooperation will bring a new world order and counter the existing Western dominance socially, economically and politically. Late president Hugo Ch√°vez saw the formation of this cooperation as the \\"beginning of the salvation of [the] people,\\" and as a major anti-imperialism movement. Like President Hugo Ch√°vez, the ex-Libyan Leader Muammar al-Gaddafi was also very critical of the Western dominance of the \\"third world\\" nations. Economic alliance One of the key goals of the cooperation is to strengthen and improve economic ties. Some of the areas which these \\"southern\\" nations look forward to improving further include joint investment in energy and oil, and a common bank. Among other regional trade agreements which were reached during the 2009 summit was Venezuela signing an oil agreement with South Africa and a memorandum of understanding with Sierra Leone to form a joint mining company. Meanwhile, Brazil has developed an increasingly successful model of overseas aid provision of over $1 billion annually (ahead of many traditional donors), which focuses on technical expertise and the transfer of knowledge and expertise. Most of Brazilian aid is allocated to Africa, specifically to Portuguese-speaking African countries, and Latin America. Brazil's form of South‚ÄìSouth development aid has been called a 'global model in waiting'.Cabral and Weinstock 2010. Brazil: an emerging aid player. London: Overseas Development Institute The two continents have over one quarter of the world's energy resources. This includes the oil and natural gas reserves in Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Venezuela, Algeria, Angola, Libya, Nigeria, Chad, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. In recent years, the South‚ÄìSouth cooperation has recognized the importance of effective financial inclusion policy in order to better deliver appropriate financial services to the poor. Because of this, financial policy makers from nearly 100 developing and emerging countries now comprise a global knowledge-sharing network called the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI). Representatives from the developing south meet annually at the Global Policy Forum (GPF), making it the most important and comprehensive forum for regulatory institutions from emerging economies with an interest in promoting financial inclusion policy. The forum is focused on developing and improving national financial inclusion strategies and policies, and is used as a platform for senior financial regulators to exchange ideas and engage in peer- to-peer learning activities. = Banks to finance infrastructure projects = One challenge for South‚ÄìSouth cooperation has been the lack of sufficient capital to start a South‚ÄìSouth bank as an alternative to the IMF and the World Bank. This has changed with the launch of two new 'South‚ÄìSouth banks'. At the sixth summit of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa), in July 2014, the five partners approved the establishment of the New Development Bank (or BRICS Development Bank), with a primary focus on lending for infrastructure projects. It will be based in Shanghai. A Contingency Reserve Agreement (CRA) has been concluded in parallel to provide the BRICS countries with alternatives to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in times of economic hardship, protect their national economies and strengthen their global position. The Russian Federation is contributing US$18 billion to the CRA, which will be credited by the five partners with a total of over US$100 billion. The CRA is now operational. In 2015 and 2016, work was under way to develop financing mechanisms for innovative projects with the new bank‚Äôs resources. The second new bank is the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. It has also been set up to finance infrastructure projects. Spearheaded by China, the bank is based in Beijing. By 2016, more than 50 countries had expressed interest in joining, including a number of developed countries: France, Germany, the Republic of Korea, United Kingdom, etc. = Asia‚ÄìPacific Free Trade Area = China is spearheading the creation of an Asia‚ÄìPacific Free Trade Area, which, according to China‚Äôs vision, would override existing bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements in the region. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in November 2014 endorsed the Beijing Roadmap for completing a feasibility study by late 2016.  South- South cooperation in science  = Role of regional economic communities = Countries of the South are developing cooperation through regional economic communities. For example, the Russian Federation is developing co-operation with Asian partners within the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Eurasian Economic Union. The latter was launched on 1 January 2015 with Belarus and Kazakhstan and has since been extended to Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. The Eurasian Economic Union replaces the Eurasian Economic Community. In July 2015, the Russian Federation hosted a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in the same city, at which the admission of India and Pakistan was announced. Regional economic communities have become a conduit for South‚ÄìSouth cooperation in science, technology and innovation. For example, Iran‚Äôs Nanotechnology Initiative Council established an Econano network in 2008 to promote the scientific and industrial development of nanotechnology among fellow members of the Economic Cooperation Organization, namely Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. = Bilateral collaboration = Countries are also co-operating in science, technology and innovation on a bilateral basis to develop infrastructure and diversify the economy. There is ‚Äòdynamic bilateral collaboration‚Äô between China and the Russian Federation, for instance. This cooperation stems from the Treaty on Good Neighbourliness, Friendship and Co-operation signed by the two countries in 2001, which has given rise to regular four-year plans for its implementation. Dozens of joint large-scale projects are being carried out. They concern the construction of the first super-high-voltage electricity transmission line in China; the development of an experimental fast neutron reactor; geological prospecting in the Russian Federation and China; and joint research in optics, metal processing, hydraulics, aerodynamics and solid fuel cells. Other priority areas for co-operation include industrial and medical lasers, computer technology, energy, the environment and chemistry, geochemistry, catalytic processes and new materials. =Role of regional centres= Increasingly, countries of the South are fostering cooperation in science and technology through regional or international centres. Africa has considerably expanded its networks of centres of excellence since the turn of the century. Most of these networks focus on biosciences but there is also a network in the field of mathematical sciences. Examples are the Bio-Innovate network based in Kenya, which focuses on improving agricultural techniques and developing agro- processing, and the African Biosafety Network of Expertise based in Burkina Faso, which helps regulators deal with safety issues related to the introduction and development of genetically modified organisms. These networks have an Achilles tendon, in that they tend to be reliant on donor funding for their survival. Many regional and international centres have been set up under the auspices of United Nations agencies. One example is the International Science, Technology and Innovation Centre for South‚ÄìSouth Cooperation (ISTIC) in Malaysia. It was established in 2008 under the auspices of UNESCO. In 2014, the Caribbean network of scientists, Cariscience, ran a training workshop in Tobago on Technopreneurship for the Caribbean, in partnership with ISTIC. Another example is a centre which uses Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East (SESAME). Most of the eight members of SESAME are developing economies: Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority and Turkey. The SESAME centre is being officially inaugurated in May 2017. Iran hosts several international research centres, including the following, which function under the auspices of United Nations bodies: the Regional Centre for Science Park and Technology Incubator Development (UNESCO, est. 2010), the International Centre on Nanotechnology (UNIDO, est. 2012) and the Regional Educational and Research Centre for Oceanography for Western Asia (UNESCO, est. 2014). Security alliance Peace and security responsibilities are also on the top of the agenda for cooperation. During the 2009 Africa-South America Summit, Colonel Gaddafi proposed a defence alliance between South America and Africa. He called the alliance \\"a Nato of the South.\\" This type of alliance aims to act as an alternative to the Security Council none of whose permanent members is from the two continents. Political unity Another area that some of the leaders intend to see big developments in is in the political arena. This is to say that cooperation will give the continents more political power when it comes to the global arena. Some leaders hope that the cooperation will offer greater freedom in choosing a political system. For example, Hugo Ch√°vez hoped to use South‚ÄìSouth cooperation as a stage on which to get his message of what he called \\"21st Century Socialism\\" across. Critique The most apparent critique is that there are just a few voices being heard. These voices are often from the comparatively rich and powerful states of the south (e.g. Brazil, India, South Africa and Venezuela).

It featured the SK Wyverns, who had claimed home ground advantage by finishing in first place at the end of the season, and the Doosan Bears, who had finished second and had defeated the Samsung Lions in a best- of-7 playoff series (4 games to 2) to advance to the next round. The SK Wyverns won the series in five games, after defeating Doosan four games straight after dropping the opening game. It pitted the final 2 teams from the 2007 Korean Series in a rematch. Game 1, October 26 Munhak Baseball Stadium, Incheon The first game of the series began at the home stadium of the Wyverns, but they failed to get the victory on opening game 2 years straight as Doosan got a decisive 5-2 victory, thanks to the excellent pitching of Matt Randal. Young prodigy Kim Kwang-hyun started for the Wyverns but was unable to shut down Doosan's hitting. SK struck first, as 2007's MVP Kim Jae-hyeon shot a solo home run over the right field fence. Doosan answered back in the 5th, when Chae Sang-byung got onto 1st base with a line drive towards 3rd base. Jeon Sang-ryeol bunt-sacrificed, then Chae advanced to 3rd on a passed ball. Lee Jong-wook hit him home with a single. Doosan went ahead in the 6th, as Kim Dong-joo hit a double, advanced on a sacrifice, then Ko Young-min got a base on balls. Doosan used power hitter Choi Jun-seok as a pinch hitter, and it paid off, as he hammered the ball, allowing Ko to score from first. Doosan added to their lead in the 7th, as Lee Jong-wook scored with help from Oh Jae- won and Ko Young-min. Hong Sung-heon shot a solo home run in the 9th, but it wasn't necessary. SK tried to fight back, but managed to only score one more run in the bottom of the 7th. A combination of Randal's pitching, as well as reliever Lee Jae-woo shut down the Wyverns. Game 2, October 27 Munhak Baseball Stadium, Incheon SK evened the series with the aid of some strong batting and some poor defensive work by Doosan. The game was an almost total turn-around of game 1, with an identical score of 5-2. Just like last year, SK started Chae Byeong-yong, while Doosan started former major-leaguer Sunny Kim. The game began well for SK as leadoff hitter Jeong Keun-woo got onto base and advanced with a narrow hit by Park Jae-hong. Lee Jin-young hit Jeong home, and Park scored after the pitcher threw a wild pitch. Doosan responded in the fourth with a double from Kim Dong-joo, then a triple from Hong Sung-heon. Ko Young-min hit a sacrifice fly to bring in the 2nd run. The game winner was in the 5th by Park Jae-sang, and in the 7th, Kim Jae-hyeon hit another home run (2 runs), for his second in the series and 2nd in 2 days. Game 3, October 29 Jamsil Baseball Stadium, Seoul Doosan returned home to their stadium in Jamsil with the series tied at 1-1 series. Doosan started left-handed Lee Hei- chun, and SK answered by starting Lee Jae-won in the place of the designated hitter, as he had a higher hitting average against left-handed pitchers. SK started Kenny Rayburn. The game started off as a pitcher's duel, with both pitchers striking out several batters. Both teams struck in the 4th inning, putting 1 run on the board each. SK went ahead 3-1 in the 6th, as young 3rd baseman Choi Jeong hit a 2 run home run on the first pitch of reliever Lee Jae-woo. Doosan answered back with a solo home run from relief catcher Choi Seung-hwan in the 7th, but SK held onto their 1-run lead to close the game up and take a 2-1 lead in the series. Doosan very nearly came back in the 9th inning, as closer Chong Tae-hyon loaded the bases with 1 out, but Kim Hyun-soo hit into a double-play, allowing SK to take the win and giving Chong the save. Game 4, October 30 Jamsil Baseball Stadium, Seoul Game 4 saw the return of Matt Randal for Doosan, while SK started sometimes-reliable Song Eun-bum in classic Kim Sung-keun strategy of fast and frequent pitcher changing. SK used 7 pitchers in total, while Doosan used only 3. Sk struck in the 1st inning with a hit from Park Jae-sang, stole to 2nd, and made it to 3rd after an error from Chae Sang-byung. Kim Jae-hyeon sacrificed to bring him home. Doosan struck back with the dangerous combination of Kim Dong-joo and Hong Sung-heon. Oh Jae-won hit into a double-play, but Kim scored from 3rd base. Game 4 continued a Doosan trend in the series of Doosan creating many scoring opportunities but failing to capitalize on them. Jeon Sang-ryeol managed to hit a lead-off double in the 3rd, but made a critical error. Lee Jong-wook hit a ball just behind the 2nd base that surely looked to be a hit, but some amazing defense from Jeong Keun-woo managed to catch the ball, and merely had to throw the ball to 2nd to tag out Jeon, who ran and never looked back. Also, Doosan managed to load the bases with 0 outs in the 7th, but once again failed to score as reliever Lee Seung-ho struck out 2 Doosan hitters, walked the next one, but the 4th one grounded out. SK decided to use Chae Byeong-yong as a closer in game 5, and he managed to hold on to the victory, giving him a rare save. He loaded the bases in the 8th, but struck out pinch-hitter Yoo Jae- woong. Doosan managed to get 1 runner to 2nd base in the 9th, but could not get any closer to scoring. SK went up 3-1, only one win away from claiming their 2nd consecutive Korean Series victory. Game 5, October 31 Jamsil Baseball Stadium, Seoul Game 5 was yet another pitcher's duel, this time between Kim Kwang-hyun and Kim Sun-woo, both vying for a win in this year's series. It was do or die for Doosan, and neither team allowed any runs until the 7th inning. Doosan had scoring opportunities almost every inning, but failed. However, SK rarely was able to get runners on base, shut down by the superb pitching of Kim Sun-woo. A reversal of fortunes came about in the 7th inning, as Sk was able to load the bases. Catcher Park Kyung-oan, who has hitless in the series, hammered a linedrive towards 3rd, hurting Kim Dong- joo's hand, and causing him to drop the ball. Sk would add one more to the scoreboard in the 8th, as Park Jae-sang hit a single, and came home with a hit from Choi Jeong. SK starter Kim Kwang-hyun allowed 0 runs in 6 innings, and was followed by 4 relievers in an attempt to shut down the hungry and now desperate Doosan hitters. Doosan once again got multiple runners on base in the 8th, but failed to score as Sk outfielder Cho Dong-hwa made an amazing catch against Hong Sung-heon. Once again reliever Lee Seung-ho saved the team, striking out Yoo Jae-woong. This performance earned Lee the MVP nomination, but he did not win. The 9th inning was the most pivotal moment of the game, as Doosan had the game but failed completely to capitalize on the situation. Once again, SK put Chae Byeong-yong on the mound as a closer. Doosan managed to load the bases with 0 outs. It looked like a Doosan comeback was inevitable. Amazingly, Chae put away Ko Young-min and Kim Hyun-soo hit into a double-play, handing SK their 2nd consecutive Korean Series victory.

He is the president of Abiding Truth Ministries, a conservative Christian organization based in Temecula, California which is listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an anti-gay hate group. He is a cofounder of Watchmen on the Walls, an international evangelical ministry based in Riga, Latvia that describes itself as \\"the international Christian movement that unites Christian leaders, Christian and social organizations and aims to protect Christian morals and values in society.\\" He was the state director of the California branch of the American Family Association and a spokesman for the Oregon Citizens Alliance. Lively has called for the criminalization of \\"the public advocacy of homosexuality\\" as far back as 2007. He gave \\"a series of talks\\" to Ugandans and met with Ugandan lawmakers immediately before anti-gay legislation in Uganda was drafted, and he allegedly helped engineer the Anti-Homosexuality Bill in Uganda. He appeared in Russian television channel Russia-1's documentary titled Sodom in September 2014. He has been interviewed in radio and television about his involvement in the ex-gay movement and his opposition to LGBT rights. According to a January 2011 profile, Lively \\"has not changed his view that gays are 'agents of America's moral decline,' but he has refocused his approach to fit his parishioners in Springfield, Massachusetts\\", and \\"is toning down his antigay rhetoric and shifting his focus to helping the downtrodden.\\" Background Lively was born and raised in the village of Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts, the oldest of six children. He became an alcoholic at the age of 12, an addiction he explains as a means to cope with an unhappy family situation. When Lively was 16, his father was committed to a mental institution, never to return. After graduating from high school in 1976, Lively spent the next 10 years \\"drifting around the United States, often homeless, sometimes sleeping under bridges and begging for spare change on street-corners.\\" Lively has stated in his autobiography: \\"I visited every one of the 48 continental states and logged over 25,000 miles by thumb, bus and train in my wandering. I didn't learn to drive a car until I was 25.\\" Lively states that he became a born-again Christian on February 1, 1986, while staying at an alcohol treatment facility in Portland, Oregon, of which he has said, \\"It was a miracle which completely removed my desire for alcohol and drugs‚Äîsomething I had been unable to do for myself over several years of a desperate futile struggle to find some way to freedom.\\" Political candidacies Lively was an independent candidate for Governor of Massachusetts in the 2014 election.07/17/2014 Radio interview with Jim Braude and Margery Eagan He ran again as a Republican candidate in the 2018 election. At the Massachusetts Republican Party's state convention on April 28, 2018, he received support from nearly a third of the delegates present, exceeding the minimum requirement to appear on the ballot for the primary election on September 4, challenging fellow GOP incumbent Charlie Baker. Lively lost the primary to Baker, with Lively receiving 36.1% support (98,214 out of 271,990 votes cast) and Baker the remaining 63.9%. Activities =Anti-abortion activism= In 1988, Lively began campaigning against abortion in Portland. In 1989, he joined Oregon Citizens Alliance and worked on the pro-life ballot measure for the 1990 general election. =Anti-homosexuality activism in the United States= In 1991, Lively, together with Oregon Citizens Alliance, shifted focus from abortion to homosexuality citing the \\"rapid advance of that agenda in Oregon\\". In 1991, Lively assaulted Catherine Stauffer, throwing her against a wall and dragging her across the floor of a Portland church, at an Oregon Citizens Alliance event she had been trying to film. In 1992 he was found liable for damages in excess of $31,000.Oregon Judicial Department Appellate Court Opinions - Catherine Stauffer v. Oregon Citizen's AllianceScott Lively profile , splcenter.org; accessed December 14, 2015. =Anti-homosexuality activism in Latvia and Russia= In 2006, Lively met with Latvian pastor Alexey Ledyaev to form an international anti-gay organization called Watchmen on the Walls, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has dubbed a hate group. Lively spent the summer of 2006 lecturing at Latvian universities and meeting with lawmakers, and preached at Ledyaev's New Generation church. During Lively's speaking engagements, he claimed that Western activists (backed by the European Union) were trying to infiltrate Latvian society and spread homosexuality, particularly to children. After his trip to Latvia, Lively then embarked on a 50-city tour of Russia and other former Soviet republics, sponsored by Ledyaev's church, which had roughly 200 congregations and a regional TV channel. As Lively traveled from the Baltics to Siberia, he pressed officials to outlaw the \\"public advocacy of homosexuality\\" and urged officials from passing anti-discrimination laws. Eight of the nine countries he visited eventually weighed nationwide bans on \\"homosexual propaganda,\\" and five (including Russia) either have bills pending or have since passed them into law. Lively takes partial credit for this development and calls Russia's gay propaganda ban his \\"proudest accomplishment.\\" On August 30, 2013, in response to anti-LGBT legislation in Russia, Lively wrote an open letter addressed to Vladimir Putin saying, \\"You have set an example of moral leadership that has shamed the governments of Western Europe and North America and inspired the peoples of the world.\\" =Anti-homosexuality activism in Uganda= In March 2009, Lively, along with evangelical activists Don Schmierer and Caleb Lee Brundidge, arrived in Kampala to give a series of talks. \\"The theme of the event, according to Stephen Langa, its Ugandan organizer, was \\"'the gay agenda‚Äîthat whole hidden and dark agenda'‚Äîand the threat homosexuals posed to Bible-based values and the traditional African family.\\" Lively gave a lengthy presentation to members of Uganda's parliament and cabinet, in which he laid out the argument that the nation's president and lawmakers would later use to justify Uganda's anti-gay crackdown; namely that Western agitators were trying to unravel Uganda's social fabric by spreading \\"the disease\\" of homosexuality to children. \\"[T]housands of Ugandans, including police officers, teachers and national politicians\\", reportedly attended the conference. Lively and his colleagues \\"discussed how to make gay people straight, how gay men often sodomized teenage boys and how 'the gay movement is an evil institution' whose goal is 'to defeat the marriage-based society and replace it with a culture of sexual promiscuity.'\\" He asserted that the 1994 Rwandan genocide \\"probably\\" involved gay men whom he referred to as \\"monsters\\". Lively wrote days later that \\"someone had likened their campaign to 'a nuclear bomb against the gay agenda in Uganda.'\\" The talks inspired the development of the Uganda Anti- Homosexuality Act, a private member's bill, was proposed in the Ugandan parliament. The bill, submitted in November 2009, called for the death penalty in some cases, and was harshly criticized in the international community. Lively expressed disappointment that \\"the legislation was so harsh.\\" \\"Lively says he recommended an approach rooted in rehabilitation, not punishment and says an anti-gay bill being considered by the Ugandan Parliament goes too far\\", even though he himself is not opposed to criminalizing homosexuality. > [M]y advice to the parliament was to go the other direction from what they > did to actually go on a proactive positive message promoting the family, > promoting marriage, etcetera, through the schools, and that if they were > going to continue to criminalize homosexuality that they should focus on > rehabilitation and not punishment. And I was very disappointed when the law > came out as it is written now with such incredibly harsh punishments. Lively has stated that he will endorse the bill if the death penalty is removed. In March 2010, Lively wrote: > In my view, homosexuality (indeed all sex outside of marriage) should be > actively discouraged by society‚Äîbut only as aggressively as necessary to > prevent the mainstreaming of alternative sexual lifestyles, and with concern > for the preservation of the liberties of those who desire to keep their > personal lifestyles private.

The lawsuit accused Lively of violating international law by conspiring to persecute the Ugandan LGBT community. This first-of-its-kind lawsuit alleged that Lively's actions over the previous decade, in collaboration with some Ugandan government officials and Ugandan religious leaders, were responsible for depriving LGBT Ugandans of their fundamental human rights based solely on their identity; the lawsuit alleged that this fell under the definition of persecution under international law and was a crime against humanity. Lively was to answer the allegations under the Crime Against Humanity of Persecution. He has portrayed the Ugandan LGBT movement as \\"pedophilic\\" and \\"genocidal\\" and linked it \\"to the Nazis and Rwandan murderers\\". Regarding the allegations of violating international law, he said, \\"That's about as ridiculous as it gets. I've never done anything in Uganda except preach the Gospel and speak my opinion about the homosexual issue.\\" Pam Spees, a staff attorney for the Center for Constitutional Rights, said, \\"This is not just based on his speech. It's based on his conduct. Belief is one thing, but actively trying to harm and deprive other people of their rights is the definition of persecution.\\" On August 14, 2013, an American federal judge ruled that the case against Scott Lively, by the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) on behalf of Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG), a Uganda-based coalition of LGBT rights and advocacy groups, could move forward. U.S. District Court Judge Michael Ponsor rejected the defendant's jurisdictional claims to dismiss the case, ruling that the plaintiffs were on solid ground under international and federal law and that First Amendment arguments were \\"premature\\". In December 2014, the First Circuit Court of Appeals rejected another petition to dismiss the case. In the summer of 2016 the case continued and a summary judgement hearing before Judge Ponsor was scheduled for September 14, 2016 in Springfield, Massachusetts. In June 2017, Ponsor dismissed the case due to lack of jurisdiction, citing the 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Kiobel v.

The phrase is mainly used in the United States and has become popular since the mid-1990s.  Origins  American pollster and political scientist Samuel Popkin coined the term \\"low-information\\" in 1991 when he used the phrase \\"low-information signaling\\" in his book The Reasoning Voter: Communication and Persuasion in Presidential Campaigns. Low-information signaling referred to cues or heuristics used by voters in lieu of substantial information to determine whom to vote for. Examples include voters liking Bill Clinton for eating at McDonald's and perceiving John Kerry and Barack Obama as elitist for wind- surfing and golfing, respectively.  Meaning  The ideological views of most low-information voters tend to be more moderate than those of high-information voters. Low-information voters are less likely to vote and when they do they generally vote for a candidate they find personally appealing. They tend to be swing voters and they tend to vote split-ticket more than well-informed voters do. Researchers attribute this to low-information voters not having developed clear cut ideological preferences. Some are single-issue voters, i.e. they vote primarily on a single issue they care very much about, such as gun control. Linguist George Lakoff has written that the term is a pejorative mainly used by American liberals to refer to people who vote conservative against their own interests and assumes they do it because they lack sufficient information. Liberals, he said, attribute the problem in part to deliberate Republican efforts at misinforming voters. In a 2011 article titled \\"Goodbye to All That: Reflections of a GOP Operative Who Left the Cult\\", thirty-year Republican House of Representatives and Senate staffer Mike Lofgren characterized low-information voters as anti-intellectual and hostile- to-science \\"religious cranks\\" and claimed Republicans are deliberately manipulating low information voters to undermine their confidence in American democratic institutions. Popular syndicated talk show host Rush Limbaugh became aware of the term in the aftermath of the 2012 presidential election, initially joking that it could be interpreted to signify stupidity. However, Limbaugh later clarified that a low information voter may also be considered in his view a \\"high liberal information voter\\". A 2012 paper by six American political scientists called \\"A Theory of Political Parties: Groups, Policy Demands and Nominations in American Politics\\" challenged the idea that Republicans want a low-information electorate and argued instead that both major American parties do. Noting that 95% of incumbents in the highly polarized House of Representatives win re-election despite voters' preference for centrist representation, the paper theorizes that voters' infrequent penalizing of extremist behaviour represents not approval, but a lack of attention and information. This, the paper says, is supported by the fact that when congressional districts and media markets overlap to create more informed electorates, extremist House members are at much greater risk for defeat. The paper proposes that in the American political system interest groups and activists are the key actor and that the electorate is uninformed and bamboozled.  Effects  A 1992 study found that in the absence of other information voters used candidates' physical attractiveness to draw inferences about their personal qualities and political ideology. A study performed using logistic regression analysis on data from the 1986 through 1994 American National Election Studies found that low-information voters tend to assume female and black candidates are more liberal than male and white candidates of the same party. A 2003 study that analyzed precinct-level data from city council elections held in Peoria, Illinois between 1983 and 1999 found that the placement of candidates' names on the ballot was a point of influence for low-information voters. An analysis concerned with the \\"puzzling finding\\" that incumbent legislators in mature democracies charged with corruption are not commonly punished in elections found that less-informed voters were significantly more likely to vote for incumbents accused of corruption than were their better-informed counterparts, presumably because they did not know about the allegations.

Superior Court of California, 495 U.S. 604 (1990), was a United States Supreme Court case addressing whether a state court may, consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, exercise personal jurisdiction over a non-resident of the state who is served with process while temporarily visiting the state. All nine justices unanimously agreed that this basis for personal jurisdiction--known as \\"transient jurisdiction\\"--is constitutionally permissible. However, the Court failed to produce a majority opinion, as the members were sharply divided on the reasons for the decision, reflecting two fundamentally different approaches to how due-process issues are to be analyzed. Justice Scalia wrote the lead opinion, joined in whole or part by three other Justices. Justice Brennan wrote an opinion joined by three other Justices. Justices White and Stevens wrote separate opinions. Procedural and factual history Dennis Burnham and Frances Cecilia (Perelman) Burnham, a married couple residing in New Jersey, agreed to divorce. Francie moved to California on July 14, 1987 with the couple's two children. Thereafter she persuaded Dennis to delay filing the divorce action in New Jersey until 18 months of separation would qualify for a \\"no fault\\" divorce. Then, several months later in early 1988 and prior to the 6-month residency requirement in California, Francie filed an action for divorce in California Superior Court. Upon learning of this action, Dennis attempted to promptly file and serve the New Jersey action instead of waiting 12 more months. Dennis was served with the summons when he travelled to California to handle an unrelated business matter and visit his children; service was made on a Sunday in the children's home. The following day, Francie was served with the New Jersey summons. Courts later held that the California action was \\"first in time.\\" Dennis filed a \\"special appearance\\" in the California court and moved to quash the service of process. He argued that he was a non- resident of California and had no connection with California sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over him consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Initially, the Superior Court in Marin County, California granted Dennis's request to allow New Jersey to decide the personal in personam jurisdiction issues and submit the subject matter in rem jurisdiction issues to California. Then, on a motion to reconsider, citing Pennoyer v. Neff (1877), the Superior Court reversed and denied Dennis's request to quash service. Dennis then petitioned for a writ of mandate from the California Court of Appeal for the First Appellate District, which denied relief, as did the California Supreme Court. Dennis then sought review from the United States Supreme Court, which granted certiorari493 U.S. 807. to address the continued validity of transient jurisdiction in light of recent developments in the law of personal jurisdiction.Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin, Oyez Project.. Approximately 29 months after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision, the California Superior Court granted the divorce in October 1992. =Legal background= At common law, recognized by the Supreme Court in Pennoyer v. Neff (1877), a civil action was commenced by serving process on the defendant within the forum jurisdiction. Service on a defendant within the forum state created jurisdiction over the defendant regardless of whether the defendant was a resident of the state or was merely visiting it, and regardless of whether the subject-matter of the lawsuit had anything to do with the defendant's activities in the state. Subsequently, in International Shoe Co. v. Washington (1946) and Shaffer v. Heitner (1977), the Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause requires that a state's exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant must comport with \\"traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,\\" at least when the defendant was not served with process in the forum state. The issue in Burnham was whether, in light of International Shoe and Shaffer, service on a non-resident visiting a state remained a constitutionally-sufficient basis for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the non-resident. Judgment of the Court The Court unanimously agreed that exercise of personal jurisdiction over Dennis Burnham based on \\"transient jurisdiction\\" through service of process was proper. However, the Justices could not agree on a rationale for the result, producing four separate opinions. =Justice Scalia's plurality opinion= Justice Scalia delivered the lead opinion in the case, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Kennedy, and in part by Justice White. Justice Scalia began by defining the question presented as \\"whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment denies California courts jurisdiction over a nonresident, who was personally served with process while temporarily in that State, in a suit unrelated to his activities in the State.\\" Justice Scalia took a historical approach to answering this question. In Justice Scalia's view, buttressed by citation of numerous cases, \\"[a]mong the most firmly established principles of personal jurisdiction in American tradition is that the courts of a State have jurisdiction over nonresidents who are physically present in the State.\\" At common law, service of process on the defendant within the forum state was a prerequisite to exercising jurisdiction over the defendant in that state. In cases such as International Shoe Co. v. Washington and Shaffer v. Heitner, the Court had accepted that a non-resident served outside a state could still be subject to jurisdiction, but only where the defendant had \\"certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend 'traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.'\\" However, these cases did not support the converse argument that the longstanding practice of obtaining jurisdiction over a defendant by serving process within the forum might now violate due process. \\"[A] a doctrine of personal jurisdiction that dates back to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment and is still generally observed unquestionably meets th[e] standard\\" of due process. =Justice Brennan's opinion= Justice Brennan, in an opinion joined by Justices Marshall, Blackmun and O'Connor, concurred that California could constitutionally exercise jurisdiction over Dennis Burnham because he had been served with process while visiting the state. However, Justice Brennan rejected Justice Scalia's contention that the long history of allowing transient jurisdiction was sufficient to resolve the case. According to Justice Brennan, the Court's decision in Shaffer v. Heitner required that all methods of obtaining jurisdiction must be evaluated according to contemporary notions of due process. Justice Brennan acknowledged that while not dispositive, the historical pedigree of transient jurisdiction was relevant in evaluating its constitutionality, because it provided potential defendants with notice that visiting a state could lead to their being subject to jurisdiction on a lawsuit in that state. While voluntarily present in a state, an individual avails himself of benefits provided by that state. Moreover, developments in modern communications and transportation make it much less burdensome than previously for a non-resident to defend himself or herself in another jurisdiction. Procedural devices such as the doctrine of forum non conveniens are available in a case where litigating in the forum would be genuinely burdensome. Justice Brennan concluded that \\"[f]or these reasons, as a rule the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant based on his voluntary presence in the forum will satisfy the requirements of due process.\\" =Justice White's opinion= In a short opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, Justice White stated that \\"[t]he rule allowing jurisdiction to be obtained over a nonresident by personal service in the forum state, without more, has been and is so widely accepted throughout this country that I could not possibly strike it down, either on its face or as applied in this case, on the ground that it denies due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\\" In Justice White's view, while the Supreme Court has authority to strike down even traditional accepted procedures that do not provide due process, there was no basis for doing so in this case. There was no showing that allowing service of process within a state to provide a basis for jurisdiction \\"is so arbitrary and lacking in common sense in so many instances that it should be held violative of Due Process in every case.\\" To avoid endless litigation, Justice White concluded that challenges to the fairness of jurisdiction based on service in individual cases need not be entertained, \\"[a]t least ... where presence in the forum state is intentional, which would almost always be the fact.\\" =Justice Stevens's opinion= In a separate opinion concurring in the judgment, Justice Stevens stated that he declined to join either Justice Scalia's or Justice Brennan's opinion because he was \\"concerned by [their] unnecessarily broad reach.\\" Justice Stevens stated that the historical evidence cited by Justice Scalia, the considerations of fairness discussed by Justice Brennan, and the common sense of Justice White's concurrence, \\"all combine to demonstrate that this is, indeed, a very easy case.\\" In a footnote, Justice Stevens laconically mused that \\"[p]erhaps the adage about hard cases making bad law should be revised to cover easy cases.\\" See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 495 * List of United States Supreme Court cases * Lists of United States Supreme Court cases by volume * List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Rehnquist Court External links * Text of decision *Link to a summary of the case *Oral argument at the Oyez Project References Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:1990 in United States case law Category:1990 in California Category:Legal history of California Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Rehnquist Court Category:Due Process Clause Category:United States due process case law Category:United States personal jurisdiction case law ","title":"Burnham v.

Born in Brooklyn, New York, he started touring as a teenager playing with jazz fusion violinist Micha≈Ç Urbaniak and singer Jean Carne, while still in high school in New York. At that time Burrus replaced Urbaniak's keyboardist Barry Eastman (who wrote \\"You Are My Lady\\" years later for Freddie Jackson). Burrus was brought to Jean Carne through percussionist-producer Norman Hedman who was one of Burrus's musical mentors as a child. Later on through these types of associations, Burrus went on to play with trumpeter Tom Browne, drummer Lenny White and singer Melba Moore. Recommended by his friend pianist Kenny Kirkland, who was the keyboardist for Sting during the mid-1980s, Burrus had moved on to play with the great Lena Horne in her award-winning show Lady and Her Music in 1984. Her band comprised Terry on piano and keyboards, Ben Brown on bass, Rodney Jones on guitar, Wilby Fletcher on drums, along with music director Linda Twine and an array of musicians including the London Symphony Orchestra. While still playing for artists, Burrus was releasing solo recordings and concertizing on his own. In 1983 Terry released his first solo single, called \\"Love Rockin'\\", for Arista Records a funk/electro/soul piece written and with all vocals and instruments by Burrus, with high-school buddy Omar Hakim drumming. This was known as Terry Burrus And Transe, produced by Burrus and Marcus Miller, another high-school friend. Burrus and Miller, along with drummer Poogie Bell, Bobby Broom, another high-school guitar friend, and Bernard Wright (also a high-school companion) went on to play for an off- Broadway show written by Weldon Irvine in 1977 called Young Gifted And Broke at the Billie Holiday Theater in Brooklyn, New York. Irvine had co-written with Nina Simone the famed song \\"To Be Young, Gifted and Black\\". Return To Forever's drummer,and jazz fusion pioneer Lenny White joined the \\"Young Gifted And Broke\\" crew of musicians as a second and replacement drummer for Poogie Bell at times, during the post Chick Corea Return to Forever season. As time went on Terry became a highly respected and successful recording session man, playing on recordings of Michael Jackson, Toni Braxton, Janet Jackson, Swing Out Sister, Mariah Carey, The Cardigans, Donna Summer, Lisa Stansfield, Gloria Estefan, Aretha Franklin, Phyllis Hyman, Frankie Knuckles, David Morales, Satoshi Tomiie, Todd Terry and others. Being no stranger to synthesizers and electronic sounds, Burrus is said to own just about every electric keyboard that has come out since the Wurlitzer electric piano. In addition Burrus has always been intrigued by the great classical masters, having studied the artistry of Mozart, Beethoven, Handel and others during his school days in New York, and in his contemporary piano compositions and playing can be heard classical influences. He performs many classical piano recitals around the world as well playing as in the jazz and pop genres. Burrus has been sideman/music director on many tours of Jazz Explosion, as they were known in the 1980s and '90s, as well as on soul and gospel concerts with the Harlem Gospel Singers, Lionel Hampton, Gato Barbieri, George Benson, Angela Bofill, Larry Carlton, Bill Withers, Ramsey Lewis, Crown Heights Affair, Chaka Khan, Ronnie Laws, The Main Ingredient, Johnny Kemp, Stanley Clarke, Noel Pointer, Bobbi Humphrey, Sherry Winston. Burrus also wrote and produced with the president of Philadelphia International Records, Kenny Gamble, including \\"Living In Confusion\\" and \\"Forever With You\\" for Phyllis Hyman. Burrus wrote \\"I Just Love You So Much\\" for Billy Paul and wrote/produced \\"Love Goddess\\" for Lonnie Liston Smith. Burrus also wrote and produced \\"I'll Wait for You\\" and \\"The One And Only Lady In My Life\\" for Virgin recording group Burrell, among a long list of other compositions and productions to his credit. With contributions to the many remixes of artists from the 1980s and '90s to the present day, reinforcing the sound of house music and electronic music, his early associations working with Def Mix Productions, Frankie Knuckles, David Morales, Satoshi Tomei and Todd Terry, Junior Vasquez, Paul Simpson, Winston Jones, Dave Shaw, Jellybean Benitez, Tony Humphries, Fran√ßois K and many other international and American DJ producers have rooted him well on the dance- floor and in the remix world. Burrus has created sounds in electronica that he has extended into the world of Techno, Trance, Ambient, World music and more, his piano style especially being prevalent and dominant in the 1990s on many recordings by well known and new artists around the world. From his teenage days as a jazz fusionist to funkster to house and electronica pioneer, Burrus has been an ambassador of electronic music.  Early life  Terry Burrus's interest in the organ and piano began at the age of five in Brooklyn at the Washington Temple Church Of God In Christ, a Pentecostal church under the founder Pastor Bishop F.D. Washington. Terry's mother Carter Lee and father James had been singing in the choir there since the mid-1950s. By the time Terry was five his parents enrolled him at the Alfred Miller Music school where he excelled to the point where he was playing gospel hymns a year or so later. He went on to study music in New York City at the La Guardia School of Arts (formerly known as Music and Art) and later attended Long Island University in New York. All the while he was recording in his personal and public recording studios as well as playing concerts worldwide as a sideman with Jean Carne, Michael Urbaniak, Tom Browne, Stanley Turrentine, Lenny White, Lena Horne, Phyllis Hyman, Crown Heights Affair and The Main Ingredient with Cuba Gooding. Terry Burrus always credits Sticks Evans, his junior high- school music teacher at John Coleman I.S.271 Junior High School in Brooklyn, for giving him encouragement and inspiration as a youngster. Stick Evans played drums for Aretha Franklin and Sammy Davis, Jr. Apart from being his teacher and mentor, Stick Evans regarded Terry as a little brother or even a son, and it was through this relationship that Burrus acquired strength to go on in the music world in life. In the late 1980s Burrus even took a newly built apartment in mid-Manhattan, in the area where Evans lived for many years until his death in the early '90s.

Federation Development =FIBA Africa Referees Clinic= The LBF was a traditional powerhouse in the North African region. The Libyan national team participated in the FIBA Africa Championship games three times, in 1965, 1970, and 1978, where they placed fifth, fifth, and tenth respectively. In past years, the federation was not very active, but recently began initiating a couple of important activities to improve the level of play in Libya and the African continent. FIBA Sports Director Lubomir Kotleba, assisted by Boujemaa Jdaini, President of the Technical Commission of FIBA Africa, visited the country for a FIBA Africa referees clinic. The Clinic was held on March 20‚Äì24, 2005 in Tripoli, with participation of 46 Referees and Referee candidates from Algeria, Libya, Mali, Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia. The two FIBA experts used the clinic to explain the latest changes in basketball rules, mechanics of basketball officiating as well as topics like officiating psychology, handling rough game situations and cooperation with players and coaches. The clinic concluded with a written test of basketball rules, a physical fitness test and a practical officiating test for referee candidates. At the closing ceremony, at which representatives of the Ministry for Sport and National Olympic Committee took part, the President of the LBF, Omar T.

It was founded primarily to support young talented musicians and bands from Northern Ireland and its huge and growing music scene by providing help and promotion, technical equipment for rehearsing, recording, gigs and event organisation, performing space and releases of band compilations (Oh Yeah Sessions). The Oh Yeah music centre's genres are varying in its manifoldness of Alternative rock, Indie rock, Electronica, Post rock, Post punk, Crossover, Experimental rock and further musical stylistic ways and conceptions. Formation The Oh Yeah project was formed after a meeting between Gary Lightbody, of Snow Patrol, the former Assistant Editor of NME Stuart Bailie, who has been presenting radio programmes for the BBC since 1999, Martin Neill, a multi-media professional and head of the web design business \\"No More Art\\" and Davy Matchett, who has been involved in business and banking for the past ten years and shares a passion for music, on 29 December 2005. The group agreed that the project would prove beneficial to the Belfast, and Northern Ireland, music scene. Additionally, the group decided that Oh Yeah would be a non-profit organization. After a number of fundraisers and charity work for the centre, Lightbody's band Snow Patrol donated a sizeable sum. Lightbody felt it would be more beneficial to get assistance from the government, and the group met Secretary of State Peter Hain on 11 January 2007 with their idea at Millbank, London. They succeeded in securing backing and financial assistance. Tim Wheeler from Ash and BBC Radio 1's Colin Murray are also counted amongst the active supporters of the Oh Yeah.

He was well known for his studies of the Chilean flora, its conservation and as university professor. Early life and study He developed an interest in natural sciences while studying agronomy at the University of Chile, from which he graduated in 1937. During 1939 and 1940 he studied plant taxonomy in the United States of America (USA), first at Harvard University and later at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. After his return to Chile, he returned to the USA in 1948 to study the Chilean plants kept in the Gray Herbarium of Harvard University. Teaching and advocacy He was an active advocate of the conservation of renewable natural resources and the scenic beauty of Chile. As a university professor, he constantly encouraged the younger generations to join him in this endeavor. He promoted the creation of the first Forestry School at the University of Chile. He taught botany for almost 40 years in the Agronomy, Forestry, and Architecture Schools of the University of Chile. Expeditions Many expeditions throughout Chile allowed him to become familiar with the flora of Chile and turned him into a tireless disseminator of its peculiarities. He promoted the creation of a Network of National Parks and Forest Reserves in Chile and was one of the first Chilean botanists to draw attention to the threatened and endangered condition of numerous endemic species of the Chilean vascular flora. He also actively participated in creating the National Botanical Garden in the Region of Valparaiso (Chile). His enthusiasm for taxonomic studies was crucial for the complete refurbishing of the National Herbarium located at the National Museum of Natural History in Santiago (Chile), which he accomplished along with a significant increase in the number of herbarium specimens, contributed by him or by others. With his wife, Ruth Schick Carrasco, he created a collection of phototypes of the Chilean specimens in foreign herbaria. His passion for plant taxonomy was so great that he named his daughters after three grass genera: M√©lica, Nassella, and Aira. Offices and awards He attended numerous conferences and scientific meetings. In 1940 he joined the Commission for the Protection of the Flora, Fauna, and Natural Scenic Beauty, which met in Washington (USA). That same year he was Vice President of the Biological Science Commission of the VIII American Scientific Congress held in the same city. In 1964 he was appointed Honorary Vice- Chairman of the X International Botanical Congress held in Edinburgh, Scotland. He was chairman of the Latin American Committee on National Parks (CLAPN) under the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) based in Switzerland. In 1967 it was incorporated as a Number Member of the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Chile. Many honors were bestowed upon him, but most notably was his appointment, in 1974, as Knight in the Most Excellent Order of the Golden Ark by his Royal Highness Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, for outstanding service in the cause of nature conservation. Notable publications His extensive research generated a considerable number of publications, mostly in Spanish, including the \\"Bibliographic Index of Chilean Grasses (1941), \\"Synopsis of the Chilean Flora\\" (1959 and 1966), \\"Plant Species described by R.A. Philippi in the 19th Century\\" (1960), \\"Wild Flowers of Chile\\" (1966), and \\"Chile: Endangered Plants Species\\" (1973). Death On May 12, 1976, while he was participating in the conference ‚ÄúExtinction is forever: threatened and endangered species of plants in the Americas and their significance in ecosystems today and in the future‚Äù at the New York Botanical Garden in commemoration of the Bicentennial of the United States of America, a heart attack ended his life at age 63.  Miscellanea  He described 8 new species for the Chilean flora, and 4 plant species have been named in his honour: Valeriana munozii (by Olga Helena Borsini),Gamochaeta munnozii (by √Ångel Lulio Cabrera), Senecio munnozii (by Cabrera), and Griselinia carlomunozii (by Michael Dillon & Melica Mu√±oz- Schick).

The context is usually one of a well defined clinical or pathological entity, which the case at hand almost ‚Äî but not quite ‚Äî fits. An opposite term in medicine, forme pleine ‚Äî seldom used by English-speaking physicians ‚Äî means the complete, or full-blown, form of a disease. Use According to gastroenterologist William Haubrich: > A patient may exhibit sudden, intense, epigastric pain and a rigid abdomen. > He is thought to have a perforated peptic ulcer. But at operation, only a > penetrating ulcer is found, sealed off by adhesion to the omentum or > anterior abdominal wall. Such a patient is said to have a forme fruste of > acute free perforation as a complication of his peptic ulcer > disease.Haubrich, William S. (1997), Medical Meanings: A Glossary of Word > Origins, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: American College of Physicians, pg 85. History The Latin phrase frustra esse means \\"to be mistaken\\" or \\"to be confused\\". As a technical term in French, the cognate fruste has been used in two related ways. First, as an antiquarian‚Äôs term it refers to a coin, medal or ancient stone on which figures and characters can no longer be recognized due to wear. Secondly, it was employed in natural history to denote mollusk shells whose striations, grooves or tips were worn down. By extension, this sense could be applied to sculpture, pottery, or other objects of great antiquity. It was in this sense of \\"indistinctness due to wear or through long use\\" that the great French internist Armand Trousseau (1801‚Äì67) first employed the term in connection with an obscured form of Graves' disease, which he described as a \\"‚Ä¶maladie dite fruste par l‚Äôabsence du goitre et de l‚Äôexophthalmie\\" (\\"‚Ä¶disease said to be crude [i.e., indistinct] for its absence of goiter and exophthalmia\\")Eulenberg, A., (1910), ‚ÄúThe Present Status of Graves' Disease (Exophthalmic Goiter.

Appleton and Company, pp 961-962. The sense of the term in medicine has slightly evolved to mean a \\"not fully developed form of an illness\\", rather than simply an obscure form. Sigmund Freud (1856‚Äì1939) often used the term forme fruste in connection with incomplete or obscured cases of neuroses and psychoses and thus the literature of psychoanalysis is replete with it. (An equivalent term in German is minimalvariante, but Freud used the French version.)

It begins when Fanny's overburdened, impoverished family sends her at the age of ten to live in the household of her wealthy uncle, Sir Thomas Bertram, at Mansfield Park. The novel follows her growth and development, concluding in early adulthood. Key events include the arrival of the charismatic Crawfords from London, the temptations of Sotherton, the family theatrical controversy, the coming-out ball, Fanny's obstinate refusal to marry Henry Crawford, Fanny's three month penance at Portsmouth, and Maria's elopement with Henry Crawford leading to family devastation followed by a final restoration.  Background  Mansfield Park is the most controversial of all Jane Austen‚Äôs novels, mainly because readers are unable to agree in their assessment of the novel‚Äôs heroine, Fanny Price. Fanny Price is unique amongst the Austen heroines in that her story begins when she is ten and traces her story up to age eighteen.Morgan, Susan \\"The Promise of Mansfield Park\\" pages 57‚Äì81 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, New York: Chelsea House, 1987 page 72. Paula Byrne says, \\"Mansfield Park is perhaps the first novel in history to depict the life of a little girl from within\\".Byrne, Paula. The Real Jane Austen: A Life in Small Things, HarperCollins Publishers. (Kindle Locations 489-490). Fanny's mother is Frances Price (n√©e Ward) youngest sister of Lady Bertram and Mrs Norris. Her father is an impoverished retired marine lieutenant in Portsmouth. There are eight other children. Because of the Price family's poverty, Sir Thomas Bertram offers to take Fanny in and bring her up at Mansfield Park, his Northamptonshire estate. Fanny is described as small for her age, \\"with no glow of complexion, nor any other striking beauty; exceedingly timid and shy, and shrinking from notice.\\" She is self-conscious, and untutored, but not brash or offensive in her movement or speech.Lane, Maggie. Understanding Austen, ch. 10, Robert Hale (Kindle Locations 1881-1882) = Fanny's arrival at Mansfield Park = Fanny feels intimidated at Mansfield Park and is homesick. The house seems far too big; Sir Thomas is daunting, Lady Bertram silent, Mrs Norris oppressive and her four cousins (Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia) are distant. Even the maidservants sneer at her clothes. Nobody puts \\"themselves out of their way to secure her comfort\\". She misses her brothers and sisters where she had value as playfellow, instructress, and nurse. Fanny, who had been taught to read, write and do needlework but nothing more, now receives her education from Miss Lee in the school-room alongside Maria and Julia. In private the sisters think her 'prodigiously stupid' and make fun of her ignorance. Mrs Norris, who spoils the sisters, constantly emphasises Fanny's inferiority. Only Edmund attempts to understand her predicament. He befriends her, helps her adapt to her new life and guides her reading.M.P. ch. 2. = Character and psychological profile = Many gentle adjectives are used in the novel to describe Fanny - sweet, pretty, quiet, modest, timid, shy, graceful - but none describe the true character of Fanny who is clever, observant, strong-minded and practical. The young Fanny is seen as mentally and physically fragile, a vulnerable girl with low self-esteem and emotionally thin-skinned. The strength that has enabled her to survive is the love of her brother William, just one year older. John Wiltshire says that, by the beginning of the 21st century, critics had come to appreciate Austen's highly sophisticated expression of her characters' psychological lives. They no longer understood Fanny as the pivot of moral right and, depending on their point of view, to be simply celebrated or berated. Instead they explored her psychological development, seeing her as ‚Äòa trembling, unstable entity, [an] erotically driven and conflicted figure, both victim and apostle of values inscribed within her by her history of adoption'.Wiltshire, John, introduction to Austen, Jane, Mansfield Park, Cambridge ed. 2005, p. lxxvii Joan Klingel Ray suggests that Fanny Price is Austen's insightful study of \\"the battered- child syndrome\\", a victim of emotional and material abuse in both households. Other writers have identified in Fanny symptoms common to those who have suffered the trauma of dislocation. Growing into adulthood Fanny learning to ride one of Edmund's horses = Young adult = Colleen Sheehan offers a partial defence for the readers and scholars who dislike Fanny. She maintains that Austen deliberately makes the character of Fanny difficult to empathise with and that one has to work at liking her. Austen refuses to give the reader simplistic stereotypes that will allow of easy moral judgement. Beneath all the liveliness and wit of the charismatic Crawfords there is an intense spiritual and moral battle being waged against Fanny and Edmund. Austen encourages her readers to think for themselves, to exercise their own moral judgement in a complex world. Once the governess, Miss Lee, has left, Fanny continues to find in Edmund a considerate companion who tries to protect her from discrimination within the family. In time she becomes romantically and jealously attracted to him, though in secret. Throughout the novel, Fanny is portrayed in the uncompromising position of loving without invitation and without hope.Byrne (2017) ch. 8, Kindle ed. loc. 3070 As an eighteen year-old adult, Fanny is considered pretty, with a good figure and countenance. But she tires quickly from any exercise, is still shy, and reluctant to give her own opinions or to assert herself. Deeply sensitive, however, she loves nature, poetry and biography, especially Shakespeare, Crabbe and Cowper. As well as later quoting from William Cowper‚Äôs Tirocinium, she also loves his extended poem, The Task.Byrne, Paula (2013) The Real Jane Austen: A Life in Small Things, ch. 1 (Kindle Locations 521-528). HarperCollins Publishers. Beginning to use her shyness creatively, she becomes a skilled observer, listener and reflector. These skills prove to be useful in future decision-making, in winning people's confidence, and eventually, in being a help and strength to others. Thomas Edwards says that, compared to the other characters, Fanny alone has a full conscience, a sympathetic understanding of what other people feel.Edwards, Thomas \\"The Difficult Beauty of Mansfield Park\\" pages 7‚Äì21 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, New York: Chelsea House, 1987 pages 16‚Äì17 Fanny's natural empathy is at times so intense that she is overwhelmed by the perceived needs of others. Her empathy also acts as a partial balance against her tendency towards being judgemental. She can feel compassion for Mrs Norris even when narrator and reader feel only condemnation. \\"Fanny's disposition was such that she could never even think of her aunt Norris in the meagerness and cheerlessness of her own small house, without reproaching herself for some little want of attention to her when they had been last together.\\"Austen, Jane, Mansfield Park, chap. 29 (Kindle Locations 3737-3739) Fanny lives by the strict moral principles she has learned from Edmund and derived from Sir Thomas's worldview. This code embraces typical regency views of propriety and of a woman's place in the world. Rousseau depicted the ideal woman as fragile, submissive, and physically weak, a view frequently reiterated in a young woman's reading matter. Fanny, with her constant illnesses, timid disposition, submissiveness and fragility, conforms outwardly to Rousseau's ideal woman.Kirkham, Margaret ‚ÄúFeminist Irony and the Priceless Heroine‚Äù pages 117‚Äì131 from Jane's Austen's Mansfield Park edited by Harold Bloom, New York: Chelsea House, 1987 pages 124‚Äì125. This leads some reviewers to consider Fanny priggish. Even Sheehan, who is deeply sympathetic to Fanny, describes her as pure, poor, plain, timid, sickly and without wit, and also rather prudish. Kingsley Amis described her as \\"morally detestable\\".Kingsley Amis, What Became of Jane Austen?, 1963. Other critics, like Claire Tomalin, point out that she is a complex personality, perceptive yet given to wishful thinking, and that she shows courage and grows in self-esteem during the latter part of the story. While faithful to the moral code she has learned from Edmund, Fanny grows into an understanding which is deeper than that of her teacher. Her sufferings, her introspection, her integrity, her willfulness and her observation of human interactions lead her to unexpected conclusions. She has a core strength and In the end, Fanny unwittingly undermines prevailing attitudes to propriety, and finds inner resources to place conscience above obedience and love above duty. = The East Room= The school-room is later renamed the East Room by Maria, and once Miss Lee departs, it becomes vacant. Fanny gradually appropriates the room, filling it with her plants, her simple treasures and the books she buys once she has a little money of her own. It becomes her safe place, her 'nest of comforts' where, though unheated (by order of Mrs Norris) she retreats in times of stress. Here she reflects that, \\"though there had been sometimes much of suffering to her; though her motives had often been misunderstood, her feelings disregarded, and her comprehension undervalued; though she had known the pains of tyranny, of ridicule, and neglect, yet almost every recurrence of either had led to something consolatory\\", and the chief consolation had always been Edmund.Austen, Jane, Mansfield Park, chap. 16 (Kindle Locations 2035-2037) Described in greater detail than any other part of the house, the room has many objects with symbolic potential. The table set against the East wall and its window with its transparency of Tintern Abbey, is suggestive of a chapel, a place of meditation, of comfort and prayer, though, unlike the improving novels of many of Austen's contemporaries, personal prayer is rarely mentioned. The trauma of her dislocation at the age of ten is recalled here by Fanny eight years later when she is promised a visit to her birth family. \\"The remembrance of all her earliest pleasures, and of what she had suffered in being torn from them, came over her with renewed strength, and it seemed as if to be at home again would heal every pain that had since grown out of the separation.\\"Austen, Jane. Mansfield Park (Kindle Locations 4880-4881) John Wiltshire describes Fanny as, \\"a heroine damaged early by her upbringing, as well as by her quasi-adoption, who experiences intense conflict between gratitude to her adoptive family and the deepest rebellion against them\\", a rebellion scarcely conscious. = Arrivals and departures = When Fanny is fifteen, her uncle Norris, the local clergyman, dies. Led to believe that she will be moved from Mansfield Park and live with Mrs Norris, Fanny again experiences the trauma of dislocation and abandonment though it soon becomes clear that Aunt Norris does not want her. The following year, Sir Thomas takes Tom to Antigua to deal with problems on his Caribbean estate, expecting to be away for about a year. His daughters do not grieve over his going, and Fanny only grieves that she cannot grieve. In his farewell private talk with Fanny, Sir Thomas encourages her to invite her brother William to visit but expresses the fear that William may see little improvement in her since they last met when she was ten. Her cousins, seeing Fanny's tears, misinterpret her pain and dismiss her as a hypocrite.MP ch. 3 The wife of the new minister has a half-sister, Mary Crawford who comes to live with her at the parsonage, accompanied by her brother, Henry Crawford. Mary, first interested in Tom, soon finds herself attracted to Edmund, a matter which distresses Fanny. = Outing to Sotherton Court = On the family visit to Sotherton Court, Fanny, now aged eighteen, silently observes Henry flirting, first with Julia and then with Maria. She is particularly concerned for Maria who is already engaged to the young master of Sotherton, the rich but dull Mr Rushworth. As Mrs Rushworth takes the party on a conducted tour of the house, Mary Crawford learns for the first time that Edmund is to become a clergyman; Mary, Edmund and Fanny subsequently debate the merits of an ecclesiastical career.McMaster, Juliet \\"Love: Surface and Subsurface\\" pages 47‚Äì56 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park edited by Harold Bloom, Chelsea House: New York, 1987 pages 52‚Äì53. David Monaghan, arguing for a conservative view of the novel, states that Fanny values what has emerged naturally over the centuries, that she alone is able to appreciate the charm of Sotherton as a great house despite its imperfections. She sees the house 'built in Elizabeth's time' as a symbol of tradition and when Mr Rushworth dismisses it as 'a dismal old prison' she defends the English idyllic society, despite in many ways being unequipped for the task.Monaghan, David \\"Structure and Social Vision\\" pages 83‚Äì102 from Jane's Austen's Mansfield Park edited by Harold Bloom, Chelsea House: New York pp. 85, 86, 89. Warren Roberts sees in this debate an expression of the conflict between French atheism and English religion. He asserts that the character of Mary Crawford, whose 'French' irreverence has alienated her from church, is contrasted unfavourably with that of Fanny Price whose 'English' sobriety leads her to faith, a faith that asserts: \\"there is something in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house, with one's idea of what such a household should be\\".Roberts, Warren Jane Austen and the French Revolution, New York: St. Martin's Press, 1979 page 34Austen, Jane. Mansfield Park, ch. 9 (Kindle Location 1171). The young people exploit Sotherton's allegorical potential, particularly in the garden and the wilderness.Edwards (JSTOR) p. 53-54 Henry, looking across the locked gate by the ha-ha says, \\"You have a very smiling scene before you\\". Maria responds, \\"Do you mean literally or figuratively?\\" She complains of being trapped behind the gate and having \\"a feeling of restraint and hardship\\".Austen, Jane. Mansfield Park, ch 10 (Kindle Location 1344-1349). The dialogue is full of innuendo. Fanny, also present, urges Maria not to climb the gate, warning of spikes, a torn garment and a fall, all unconsciously suggestive of moral violence.Edwards, Thomas (1965) ‚ÄúThe Difficult Beauty of Mansfield Park.‚Äù Nineteenth-Century Fiction, vol. 20, no. 1, pp. 53-54. www.jstor.org/stable/2932492 (Also in Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, New York: Chelsea House, 1987)Edwards (JSTOR) p. 53-54 Lucy Worsley calls this Austen's most striking incidence of phallic symbolism.Worsley, Lucy (2017) Jane Austen at Home: A Biography . Hodder & Stoughton. Kindle Edition.ch. 9. Home theatricals While Sir Thomas is still in Antigua, the elder son, Tom, recently returned from one of his diversions, and influenced by his new friend, the recently arrived Mr. Yates, decides that the young people should entertain themselves with amateur theatricals. All apart from Fanny and Edmund are enthusiastic and after several days of discussion and argument the play Lovers' Vows is chosen. On reading the script, Fanny is astonished that the play should be thought suitable for private theatre and considers the two leading female roles as \\"totally improper for home representation ‚Äî the situation of one, and the language of the other so unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty\\". She believes from her observations of the household that the acting will have a negative impact on the emotions and subsequent behaviour of the actors. However, she lacks the strength and courage to persuade the others.Tave, Stuart \\"Propriety and Lover's Vows\\" pages 37‚Äì46 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, New York: Chelsea House, 1987 page 40. When Tom and Mr Yates suggest bringing in an outsider to act, Edmund is even more distressed. He is concerned about Sir Thomas' sense of propriety which abhors any invasion of privacy. He also dislikes the thought of a stranger performing an intimate scene with Mary Crawford and so reluctantly accepts the part himself. Fanny is disturbed by Edmund's change of mind, though others gloat. But despite being pressed, Fanny continues in her refusal to act. However, she agrees to be a prompter and becomes very involved. During rehearsals, Fanny observes the ongoing flirtation between Henry and the about- to-be-married Maria, \\"Maria acted well, too well.\\"Austen, Jane. Mansfield Park, ch. 18 (Kindle Locations 2201-2202) She also sees the sexual tension and attraction between Edmund and Mary as they play the part of the two lovers.Tave, Stuart \\"Propriety and Lover's Vows\\" pages 37‚Äì46 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, New York: Chelsea House, 1987 page 43. Fanny's jealousy prompts much of the novel‚Äôs dynamic.Byrne (2017) ch.8, Kindle loc. 3099 alt= = The master returns = Some commentators see an allusion to the judgement parables of the Gospels as the young people entertain themselves during Sir Thomas's absence. In the parables, the Day of Judgement comes when least expected so hearers are warned to be obedient, faithful and alert, always ready for the master's return. On what turns out to be the final rehearsal, the door of the room is thrown open, and Julia, with face aghast, exclaims, ‚ÄúMy father is come!\\".Bonaparte, Felicia. \\"\\"LET OTHER PENS DWELL ON GUILT AND MISERY\\": THE ORDINATION OF THE TEXT AND THE SUBVERSION OF \\"RELIGION\\" IN JANE AUSTEN'S \\"MANSFIELD PARK\\".\\" Religion & Literature 43, no. 2 (2011): 45-67. p. 50 http://www.jstor.org/stable/23347030 For the first readers, this cliff-hanger marks the end of volume one. The story resumes with consternation, each person feeling it \\"most unwelcome, most ill-timed, most appalling\\". Every heart is sinking under some degree of self-condemnation or undefined alarm, ‚ÄúWhat will become of us? What is to be done now?‚Äù '... and terrible to every ear were the corroborating sounds of opening doors and passing footsteps.' For half a minute, there is complete silence. Julia, the first to speak, declares self-righteously, ‚ÄúI need not be afraid of appearing before him.‚Äù Fanny herself is full of fear, though Edmund later informs Sir Thomas, \\"All of us have been more or less to blame except Fanny.\\" Sir Thomas greets his family warmly. When he finally learns of their activity he is upset, puts an end to the play, but deals with them gently. = Slave trade = It is generally assumed that Mansfield Park, being a newly built property, had been erected on the proceeds of the British slave trade. Fanny asks Sir Thomas about the slave trade but receives no answer. The pregnant silence (underlined the following day in conversation with Edmund) perplexed Fanny and continues to perplex critics. Austen here, as often in the novel, raises moral questions but invites the reader to make their own judgement. Claire Tomalin, following the literary critic, Brian Southam, argues that in questioning her uncle about the slave trade, the usually timid Fanny shows that her vision of the trade's immorality is clearer than his.Tomalin, (1997) p.230. Fanny (like Austen) favours the poet William Cowper, who was a passionate abolitionist and often wrote poems on the subject. His most notable work, The TaskByrne (2014) ch. 1, (Kindle Location 523) was an assault on contemporary society, condemning the slave trade, French despotism, fashionable manners and lukewarm clergymen, all matters of concern to Austen.  Assault  Henry tells Mary of his plan to seduce Fanny = Flirtation = Henry Crawford returns some time after Maria's marriage to Mr Rushworth. For Henry, as for Mary, sexual conquest is the motivating force in a romantic relationship. Henry decides to ‚Äòmake a hole in Miss Price‚Äôs heart‚Äô simply because he thinks he can.Byrne, Paula (2013) ch. 8. Kindle .loc. 2773 He pretends to court Fanny, showing her attention and kindness. Fanny does not appreciate his attentions. She has a bad opinion of Henry's character, believing he has no principles. Sir Thomas, observing Henry's behaviour and failing to recognise his flaws, starts to think Henry might be in love with Fanny and approves. Henry shocks his sister by declaring that he has fallen in love with Fanny and speaks of her sweet conduct and forbearance. Mary identifies the only real attraction for Henry as Fanny's resistance to his charms, but begins to think he might truly be in love. Mary's attitude to Fanny now becomes ambivalent and she colludes with Henry in his attempted conquest of her. = Coming out = Fanny's 'coming out' ball, is the culmination of Sir Thomas' growing endorsement, following his return from Antigua. It begins when he gives her permission to attend the Grant's dinner party at the parsonage and makes his carriage available to her despite Mrs Norris' objections.Monaghan, David. ‚ÄúMansfield Park and Evangelicalism: A Reassessment.‚Äù Nineteenth-Century Fiction, vol. 33, no. 2, 1978, pp. 215‚Äì230. JSTOR, p. 229 www.jstor.org/stable/2933347. Henry dances with Fanny at the ball, and later, by using his uncle's influence, tries to gain her favour by facilitating the promotion of William to lieutenant in the Royal Navy. But when he proposes to Fanny, she rejects him. Apart from Henry's persistence, she has to cope with Sir Thomas' angry reaction. Fanny cannot tell of her secret love for Edmund and she is not willing to harm Maria and Julia by revealing Henry Crawford's scandalous behaviour towards them. Fanny is further isolated when Edmund fails to support her. Austen biographer Claire Tomalin argues that \\"it is in rejecting obedience in favour of the higher dictate of remaining true to her own conscience that Fanny rises to her moment of heroism.\\"Claire Tomalin, Jane Austen: A Life (New York: Vintage, 1997), p. 230. Trauma and restoration Fanny, accompanied by her younger sister, introduces Henry to her father = Portsmouth = \\"Home\\" is one of several major themes in the novel. Sir Thomas sends Fanny back to her family in Portsmouth so that she can better understand the benefits of what he believes to be an ideal match. Fanny anticipates this visit with excitement but soon realises that her memories of Portsmouth have been greatly idealised. In a conversation with Mary the previous autumn, Fanny had ruminated on the mystery and unpredictability of memory. Now, surrounded by the chaos of the Price household, she longs to return to Mansfield, her memories again transformed. Change in Fanny's character is most marked during her three months exposure to Portsmouth life. As she reassesses her own abilities, she realises she is capable of seeing and judging correctly, of giving, and of being positively useful. Symbolically a descent into hell, Portsmouth life becomes an opportunity for change and growth. One Saturday morning, nearly four weeks after her arrival, Fanny receives an unexpected visit from Henry. He treats her chaotic family with respect; his love for her is apparently constant. While still refusing Henry, she begins to think about him a little more favourably. Some time later, however, Mr Price, reads in his borrowed newspaper that Henry and Maria have eloped. Fanny learns more detail from letters sent by Mary and later Edmund: Henry has fulfilled her worst fears. Fanny is eventually brought back by Edmund to a traumatised Mansfield. She alone has the experience and inner strength to survive the trauma and becomes chief support to the family. She is welcomed as comforter to Aunt Bertram, listener to Edmund in his disappointed assessment of Mary, and increasingly as a special friend to Sir Thomas. Edmund unburdens himself to Fanny Susan Morgan says that Fanny, though a flawed heroine, possesses \\"the energy, open to us all, to struggle against selfishness, toward self-knowledge and that generosity of mind which should illuminate our view of the people around us.\\"Morgan, Susan \\"The Promise of Mansfield Park\\" pages 57‚Äì81 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, New York: Chelsea House, 1987 page 75 Fanny's principal virtue is that of 'growing worth', her ability to understand the world around her, to use her reason, to care about others, to change yet remain true to herself.Morgan, Susan \\"The Promise of Mansfield Park\\" pages 57‚Äì81 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, New York: Chelsea House, 1987 page 81. = The ending = Sir Thomas takes a long time to recover, examining his conscience and past motives. As he regains confidence, he comes to depend more on Fanny, treating her as a much loved daughter. Byrne finds in Mansfield Park an exploration of the role of parents in raising their children and forming their moral characters. Over time, Sir Thomas has gradually changed his view of his niece. At first he felt that she was not the social equal of his daughters. At the end, he acknowledges her advantages in starting from hardship in her parents' home, and recognises his failings in guiding his own daughters. Over time, Edmund proposes to Fanny and is delighted to find that she has always loved him. Austen's sister, Cassandra, thought Fanny should have married Henry, but despite their arguing about the matter, Jane stood firm.Worsley (2017) ch. 18. At the end of the book, the narrator suggests that if Henry had been more patient, Fanny would probably have accepted him. Additionally, Fanny's beloved cousin Edmund, whom she longed to marry, might have married Mary, had Mary not destroyed her own reputation by attempting to justify her brother's scandalous affair. Some commentators, like Thomas Edwards, see this as a rare weakness in the text, believing that if Fanny had accepted Henry, the narcissistic regency rake would have soon lost interest and turned his attentions elsewhere. Even in the text, Mary speculates that if they had married, Henry would have satisfied himself with the occasional dalliance. Colleen Sheehan concludes that \\"just as Fanny tries to remain a bystander to the production of Lovers‚Äô Vows but is drawn into the action, we the audience of bystanders are drawn into participation in the drama of Mansfield Park. Austen does not save Henry and Mary Crawford in this work; only they could save themselves. Neither does she save her readers. Our judgement must be our own.\\" See also *Who is Fanny Price?, an analysis of the character References Category:Mansfield Park characters Category:Fictional gentry ","title":"Fanny Price"},{"id":"20034299","text":"The National Radio Institute (NRI) established the Conar Instruments division in the fall of 1961 and announced it in their bimonthly publication, The NRI News.

It is owned and operated by Boyd Gaming. The resort was announced as the Aliante Station in December 2005, as a joint project between Station Casinos and The Greenspun Corporation, with an initial cost of $400 million to $450 million. Construction began in February 2007, and the resort was built at a cost of $662 million. After opening in November 2008, the resort operated at a financial loss. Station Casinos filed for bankruptcy the following year, and the resort's ownership was transferred to a holding company. Profits subsequently improved, and Station Casinos continued managing the property until November 2012, when it was renamed Aliante Casino and Hotel. Parts of the resort were then rebranded and refurbished, at a cost of $2.8 million. Boyd Gaming purchased the hotel- casino in 2016, at a cost of $380 million. History Aliante Station logo (2008‚Äì2012) Mike Montandon, mayor of North Las Vegas, Nevada, was initially against the inclusion of a casino in the planned community of Aliante during its early planning stages in 2002, although he was ultimately convinced by the community's developers that it would be a good idea. In October 2002, of property at the northeast corner of the Las Vegas Beltway and Aliante Parkway were set as the future site of a hotel-casino in the community. The land was owned by The Greenspun Corporation through its American Nevada Company, which was co-developing the Aliante community. Aliante Station was announced on December 20, 2005, as a joint project between Station Casinos and The Greenspun Corporation, which had previously partnered in developing the Green Valley Ranch hotel-casino. Under the deal, Station Casinos would build and manage the resort, which would include approximately 200 hotel rooms and 2,000 slot machines. Construction would cost between $400 million and $450 million, with joint financing from both companies. Construction was expected to begin in late 2006 or early 2007, with an opening in mid-2008. In September 2006, Station Casinos announced that the project's budget had increased to $600 million as the result of rising construction costs, in addition to redesigned plans for a larger resort. Rising construction costs accounted for approximately $30 million of the increased budget. Groundbreaking took place on February 22, 2007. The property had received 1,000 employee applications each week from mid-July through early October 2008. Prior to its opening, Station Casinos expected some economic difficulty for Aliante Station due to the Great Recession. Station Casinos' target clientele was a combination of the company's current customer base, the 6,500 households in the Aliante community, tourists, and visitors to the nearby Las Vegas Motor Speedway. The project was completed at a cost of $662 million. =Opening= Following a fireworks show, the Aliante Station opened early, at 10:40 p.m. on November 11, 2008, due to large crowds gathered outside. The resort had been scheduled to open at 11:11 p.m., a time which was considered lucky. It was the first new hotel-casino to open in North Las Vegas since the Cannery Casino and Hotel in 2003. A pre-opening party was held for nearly 3,000 invited guests, and included an hour-long concert performance by Sheryl Crow. Guests included George Maloof, Terrence Lanni, and other gaming company officials. Aliante Station included the largest casino in North Las Vegas at the time, measuring , with 2,554 slot machines and 40 table games. The casino also included a 170-seat sportsbook, with large television monitors spanning a total of 96 feet. Approximately 1,500 of the slot machines were penny games, and the resort also offered inexpensive restaurant options to appeal to Station Casinos' customer base while attracting new customers during the weak economy. The resort was located within a three-mile radius of more than 100,000 residents. The resort featured a food court as well as six restaurants, including Station Casinos' Feast Buffet. Also included was Camacho's Cantina, a Mexican restaurant with more than 100 different types of tequila, as well as a chandelier made out of 2,700 empty tequila bottles. Aliante Station featured a desert theme. Its design was inspired by Scottsdale, Arizona, and company officials described it as \\"contemporary Scottsdale with a combination of muted and vibrant colors.\\" A modern design was chosen after positive customer reactions to Station Casinos' Red Rock Resort, which opened in April 2006 with a modern design. The resort included Earth tones and crystal adornments, similar to the larger Red Rock Resort. Aliante Station included approximately 1,400 employees at its opening, including 350 who transferred from Station Casinos' other resorts. The resort had 5,000 parking spaces, including a 3,300-space parking garage. The resort also had of convention space with capacity for up to 1,000 people, in addition to an arcade and a 700-person pool.

The showroom included seating for 600 people, and could be arranged into a 340-seat lounge. The hotel also opened on November 14, with 202 rooms and 9 suites, while a planned future phase would add a second hotel tower for an additional 202 rooms. Similar to the Green Valley Ranch arrangement with The Greenspun Corporation, Station Casinos received a management fee of two percent of revenues for Aliante Station, and five percent of its cash flow. =Operation and sale= Aliante Station in 2012 After its opening, Aliante Station operated at a financial loss due to below-average operating margins, and its employee count later decreased to 880. After Station Casinos filed for bankruptcy in July 2009, Aliante was handed over in November 2011 to its creditors, a group of nine banks and three private equity firms that were owed more than $378 million, while the property's estimated liquidation value was only $47‚Äì53 million. ALST Casino Holdco LLC, a holding company, was created to own the resort, with its largest shareholders being Apollo Global Management (20%), Standard General (28%) and TPG Capital (20%). After the ownership change in November 2011, profits improved over the next year. Station Casinos continued to manage Aliante Station under an agreement with the new owners until November 1, 2012, when the resort was renamed Aliante Casino and Hotel. The Aliante was then managed by Aliante Gaming, and a 24-hour restaurant, The Farm 24/7, was added that month. A total of $2.8 million was spent on rebranding and refurbishing parts of the resort; a second-floor spa area was among the improvements. Following the end of Station Casinos' involvement in the property, three restaurants were rebranded and reopened in January 2013: The Salted Lime, Bistro 57, and the Medley Buffet. In the year after the management change, 200 additional employees were hired, for a total of 860. The casino's 1,800 slot machines were also updated, and a bingo room was added as well. Hotel renovations also took place. By February 2014, hotel occupancy had increased to an average of 90 percent, in comparison to 40 percent in late 2012.

It was first published in Japan by Towa Chiki in 1990 and in North America by SOFEL in 1992. Plot Set in a fantasy world, an evil warlock named Zabbaong attacks the once peaceful land of Baljing with his army of monsters, leaving the country in ruins. The Dragon Spirit, the guardian deity of the Baljing people, decides to take vengeance on Zabbaong by bringing the statue of a legendary warrior to life. The warrior must travel to Zabbaong's lair at Mount Gia in order to slay the evil warlock and avenge the people of Baljing. Gameplay The first stage of Dragon Fighter. The Metamorphosis gauge below the player's vitality gauge allows the main character to transform into a flying dragon. The player takes control of a magical human fighter who has the ability to transform himself into a flying dragon. As the fighter, the player can run, crouch, jump, and attack with his sword as he would in most side-scrolling action games. As the fighter, the player can also shoot a projectile attack by holding the B button until the character begins to flash, and waiting until the attack is fully charged. The types of projectile fired by the player depends on the color of the player's outfit, which can be changed by picking up certain power-up items labeled with the letters G (green, the player's default color), B (blue), and R (red). Underneath his life gauge is a \\"metamorphosis gauge\\" that will gradually be filled as the player destroys his enemies. When the metamorphosis gauge is at least halfway full, it will flash, and the player can transform into the dragon by pressing and holding \\"up\\" on the d-pad at the peak of a jump (the peaks of any jumps where the \\"A\\" button is let go prematurely also count). As a dragon, the player will hover in the air while the screen scrolls automatically to the right, similarly to a side-scrolling shoot-'em-up game. The dragon's attack corresponds to the color of the player's outfit. While the player can fly in any of the eight directions, they cannot turn around and the dragon will only face and attack to the right. As a dragon, the player's metamorphosis gauge will gradually be drained out. The player will transform back to a fighter if the metamorphosis gauge empties out completely, and the player can also transform back at any time by pressing the \\"down\\" and \\"A\\" buttons simultaneously. Though the instruction manual says you can also do so by rapidly pressing the A button, doing so does not work. Other power-ups (besides the different color outfits) include energy restoring potions, a flower that helps fill the metamorphosis gauge faster, and a ring that destroys all on-screen enemies. At the end of each stage, the player will receive a staff that will increase their maximum health. The staff will also partly refill the players health. There are six stages in all, each with their own guardian awaiting to challenge the warrior at the end. The game will end if the player loses all of their life power and only three chances are provided to continue at the stage where they died before the player is forced to start all over.

He plays an important part in disciplining the main characters on the ship as the story progresses, and helps the protagonists survive against the pirates later on. In the novel He first appears to the reader as a strict, bitter man who finds fault with everything and is never satisfied.Stevenson, p.52-57, Smollett says, \\"I'll have no favourites on my ship!\\" However, he quickly reveals that not all is well aboard the ship, and his first conversation with Jim Hawkins, Dr. Livesey, and Squire Trelawney foreshadows the eventual mutiny of many of the Hispaniolas members under the leadership of Long John Silver, a cunning and wealthy one-legged pirate. When the Hispaniola finally reaches its destination and the pirates rebel, he organizes the faithful crew's flight from the Hispaniola onto the shores of the island and helps in gaining a stockade. The next day, he attempts to negotiate with \\"Captain\\" Long John Silver, but the negotiations fail due to the arrogance of Silver and the stubbornness of Smollett. (Indeed, Smollett admitsStevenson, p. 124 \\"My lads,\\" said he, \\"I've given Silver a broadside. I pitched it in red-hot on purpose; and before the hour's out, as he said, we shall be boarded. We're outnumbered, I needn't tell you that, but we fight in shelter; and a minute ago I should have said we fought with discipline. I've no manner of doubt that we can drub them, if you choose.\\" that he has goaded Silver on purpose, reasoning that battle is probably inevitable and might as well be fought sooner rather than later, while they are alert and fresh.) As a result, Silver storms off in a rage, and Smollett is left to organize the defence of the stockade. In the battle of the stockade, he is seriously wounded by two bullets, though neither incapacitates him, and he disappears from the story for the most part. In the end, he and the faithful crew sail back to Bristol laden with treasure, and he retires from seafaring. Captain Smollett's role in the story is crucial, but he is usually remembered for his temperamental personality. He is obsessed with duty and expects all his orders to be followed to the letter.Stevenson, p.172, Silver says, \\"'Dooty is dooty,' says he, and right he is.\\" When the stockade's defences break down during his negotiations with Silver, he explodes, venting his rage on the Doctor and Squire Trelawney for abandoning their stations to watch the negotiations.Stevenson, p.124, Smollett says, \\"Mr. Trelawney, I'm surprised at you, sir. Doctor, I thought you had worn the king's coat!\\" Yet, he doesn't fail to reward those who perform well and praises Abraham Gray, a mutineer who defects to their side, for staying at his post dutifully.Stevenson, p.124, Smollett says, \\"Gray, I'll put your name in the log; you've stood by your duty like a seaman.\\" Film adaptations * Buddy Messinger in the 1918 version. * Harry Holden in the 1920 version.http://gensoup.org/genealogy/wallace/hmh.html * Lewis Stone in the 1934 version. * Basil Sydney in the 1950 Disney live-action version. * Rik Battaglia in the 1972 live-action version. * Richard Beale in the 1977 version. * in the 1982 version. * Klaus L√∂witsch in the 1987 outer space version. * In the 1996 Disney Muppets version, the character was renamed Captain Abraham Smollett (Kermit the Frog) by Brian Henson and the scriptwriters.

Construction and acquisition Scorpion was built in 1896 as Sovereign, a two-masted schooner-rigged, 775-ton, steel steam yacht, for M.C.D. Borden by John N. Robins, South Brooklyn, New York. She was powered by a pair of triple expansion steam engines, with cylinders of 15, 24 and 39 inches by 21-inch stroke, built by the W. & A. Fletcher Co. of Hoboken, New Jersey. Steam was supplied by two Babcock & Wilcox boilers at a working pressure of 225 pounds. The engines reportedly developed 2500 indicated horsepower and in an 1896 race with the steamer Monmouth‚Äîsaid to be the second fastest steamer in New York‚ÄîSovereign won handily. The U.S. Navy purchased her on 7 April 1898 for service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Renamed USS Scorpion, she was commissioned on 11 April 1898 with Lieutenant Commander Adolph Marix in command. Service history =Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War= Following commissioning, Scorpion proceeded to Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she joined the Flying Squadron on 1 May 1898 and prepared for duty in the Caribbean. On 22 May, she arrived with the squadron off Cienfuegos, Cuba, then continued on to the Santiago de Cuba area with dispatches for ships scouting off that port. On 25 May, she returned to Cienfuegos, patrolled there on blockade duty until the next day, then departed for Key West, Florida, for coal and water. On 7 June, Scorpion headed south, escorted a provisions ship and an ammunition ship to Santiago de Cuba, then, until 22 June, performed blockade duties off the harbor there. On 22 June, she assisted in clearing the beach at Daiquir√≠ in preparation for a United States Army landing and, on 23 June, carried out a similar mission at Siboney. On 24 June, she resumed blockade duties off Santiago de Cuba. On 30 June, she shifted to Cape Cruz, and on 1 July she joined the armed tug in an unsuccessful attack on Spanish gunboats in Manzanillo harbor. After the attack, she retired to waters off the entrance, captured a provisions lighter, and patrolled there until 5 July. Scorpion then proceeded to Guantanamo Bay for water, coal, provisions, and ammunition. She returned to Manzanillo on 11 July, and, on 18 July, participated in another attack that destroyed all Spanish Government vessels then in the harbor. After the second attack on Manzanillo, Scorpion resumed blockade duties, continued them until 3 August, then returned to Guantanamo Bay, whence she carried dispatches for the remainder of the war, which ended on 13 August. =Pre- World War I= On 27 November, Scorpion departed Cuban waters. A month later, she arrived at New York and, on 14 January 1899, she was decommissioned in preparation for conversion to a gunboat. Recommissioned on 22 August 1899, Scorpion was assigned to the Isthmian Canal Commission and ordered to Central America. Into the spring of 1900, she remained in the Caribbean as the Commission investigated the proposed canal routes. A report from February 1900 has her visiting Kingston, Jamaica, during a visit to that island of the British North America and West Indies Squadron. In June 1900, she returned to the United States, operated off the U.S. northeast coast into the autumn of 1900, then resumed operations in the Caribbean. From November 1900 to May 1901, she cruised off Hispaniola. In June 1901, she arrived at Boston, Massachusetts, and on 24 July 1901 she was again decommissioned. On 1 July 1902, Scorpion was recommissioned and assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron. On 2 September 1903 she collided with in the East River with considerable damage done to both vessels. For the next six years, she carried dispatches and personnel, conducted hydrographic surveys, and participated in exercises along the United States East Coast and in the Caribbean, operating primarily off Santo Domingo during 1906 and 1907. Ordered to the Mediterranean in 1908, Scorpion sailed from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 22 October 1908. On 4 December 1908, she arrived at Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire to take up duties as station ship, but she was ordered to Messina, Italy to assist in relief efforts for the survivors of an earthquake there. She supported International Medical Service efforts from 3‚Äì8 January 1909, then steamed back to the Ottoman Empire. From 10 February-15 July, she was at Naples, Italy, for repairs. She returned to Constantinople on 20 July and assumed station ship duties, which included work for the U.S. Embassy. From 27 November 1910 ‚Äì 28 January 1912, she was at Trieste in Austria-Hungary for extensive repairs, and in February 1912 she returned to Constantinople. In August 1912, she assisted earthquake victims in the Ottoman Empire and, in October 1912, as the First Balkan War broke out, she commenced operations to assist Americans caught in disputed areas. On 18 November, the Diplomatic Corps resident in Constantinople decided to land 2,500 men and 26 guns to protect foreign residents and their interests from rioting. In addition to detachments from British, French, German, Italian, and Russian warships, Scorpion landed a small detail to guard the U.S. Legation. The men from Scorpion reembarked on 3 December. Throughout the First Balkan War, which lasted six months, and the Second Balkan War, which followed in the summer of 1913, Scorpion continued to protect American interests. After the two wars, she assisted the international commissions which gave aid to refugees and displaced persons. =World War I= World War I began in August 1914, and in November 1914 the Ottoman Empire entered it on the side of the Central Powers. During the first years of the war, the Ottoman government held Scorpion at Constantinople. The U.S. entered the war on the side of the Allies on 6 April 1917, and, on 11 April 1917 the Ottoman government interned Scorpion. Under Ottoman Turkish guard from 15 November 1917, she was allowed to assist British personnel released from prisoner-of-war camps in the interior of the Ottoman Empire during late October 1918. Under the Armistice of Mudros of 30 October 1918, the participation of the Ottoman Empire in World War I ended on 31 October 1918, and on 9 November 1918, the Ottoman Empire allowed Scorpion to resume her previous activities and soon thereafter she began assisting the many refugees in the area. =Post-war= USS Scorpion visiting Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire on 7 July 1920\\\\. With the arrival at Constantinople of Rear Admiral Mark L. Bristol, U.S. High Commissioner to the Ottoman Empire and Senior U.S. Naval Officer in Turkish Waters, Scorpion assumed duties as flagship and dispatch vessel, continuing, at the same time, her station ship and relief work. Redesignated PY-3 in 1920 when the U.S. Navy instituted its alphanumeric hull classification system, she shifted to Phaleron Bay, Greece, in November 1923 and took up duties as station ship in the eastern Mediterranean. In late 1926, Commander Moses B. Byington took command. On 16 June 1927, she departed the Mediterranean under Commander Byington and steamed west to return to the U.S. On 11 July 1927, she arrived at Philadelphia. Final decommissioning and disposal Scorpion was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 27 October 1927, as part of Navy Day observances, with Rear Admiral Thomas P. Magruder, commandant of the Navy Yard, in charge of the ceremonial. Captain H. A. Jones was her last commanding officer.Associated Press, ‚ÄúFamous Naval Ship Is Taken From Service - Gunboat Scorpion Retired After Cruising 29 Years Since Spanish War,‚Äù The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Friday 28 October 1927, Volume LXI, Number 58, page 4.

ŒöŒ±œÅœÖŒ¨œÑŒµŒπŒ±; Caryae revolted from Sparta after the Battle of Leuctra (371 BCE), and offered to guide a Theban army into Laconia; but shortly afterwards it was severely punished for its treachery, for Archidamus III took the town and put to death all the inhabitants who were made prisoners. Caryae was celebrated for its temple of Artemis Caryatis, and for the annual festival of this goddess, at which the Lacedaemonian virgins used to perform a peculiar kind of dance.Lucian. de Salt. 10; This festival was of great antiquity, for in the Second Messenian War, Aristomenes is said to have carried off the Lacedaemonian virgins, who were dancing at Caryae in honour of Artemis. It was, perhaps, from this ancient dance of the Lacedaemonian maidens, that the Greek artists gave the name of Caryatid to the female figures which were employed in architecture instead of pillars. The tale of Vitruvius respecting the origin of these figures, is not entitled to any credit. He relates that Caryae revolted to the Persians after the Battle of Thermopylae; that it was in consequence destroyed by the allied Greeks, who killed the men and led the women into captivity; and that to commemorate the disgrace of the latter, representations of them were employed in architecture instead of columns.Vitruvius, 1.1.5. The exact position of Caryae has given rise to dispute. It is evident from the account of Pausanias, and from the history of more than one campaign that it was situated on the road from Tegea to Sparta.

He was possibly also a composer, but the only two works attributed to him may have been written by Polish composer Moritz Moszkowski. Life Very little is known about his life. He became the piano accompanist to Pablo de Sarasate and to his own brother, the violinist Teodor (Fyodor) de Schl√∂zer. In 1879 he taught at the Institute of Music in Warsaw, where he succeeded Juliusz Janotha. Ignacy Jan Paderewski mentions him in his letters, sometimes by disparaging references such as \\"Mr. Paul\\" and \\"Pablito\\". Around 1892 he became a professor at the Moscow Conservatory, where his most important pupil was the music historian Leonid Sabaneyev. On 3 February 1894, he performed the Chopin Cello Sonata with the visiting Czech cellist Hanu≈° Wihan, at the Conservatory.Hanus Wihan His niece Tatiana Fyodorovna Schl√∂zer became Alexander Scriabin‚Äôs second wife. His nephew, Tatiana‚Äôs brother, was the music critic Boris de Schl√∂zer. Controversy He is unknown as a composer except for two √©tudes, Op. 1, for piano. The assertion made in reference materials ‚Äì that Sergei Rachmaninoff used √âtude No. 2 in A-flat as his daily warm-up exerciseJorge Bolet ‚Äì Encores ‚Äì may also not be entirely accurate (one source refers to this story as a legend). There are several easily available recordings of the √©tude, such as by Jorge Bolet and Stephen Hough. There is also a famous 1933 recordingArkivMusic.com by Eileen Joyce Bach Cantatas Website. The first recording, from 1907, was by the Liszt pupil Vera Timanova. Some historians believe that de Schl√∂zer was not the composer of these √©tudes at all, and, given their virtuosity, it is very intriguing why nothing else from his pen ever appeared, or why he did not achieve any sort of recognition as a major pianist himself. The story goes that they were in fact written by Moszkowski, who lost the manuscript to de Schl√∂zer in a card game, who published them as his own works.ed. Dmitry Feofanov, Dover Publications, \\"Rare Masterpieces of Russian Piano Music\\", Introduction, p. ix The de Schl√∂zer √âtude No. 2 is longer, more elaborate, and more technically demanding than the 11th of Moszkowski's 15 √âtudes de Virtuosit√©, Op. 72, but both are in A-flat and in a similar bravura style. However, it may be that these similarities gave rise to the legend that de Schl√∂zer pieces were written by Moszkowski.

Fox was born on 2 May 1912, the son of an electrical engineer, and attended Regent Street Polytechnic Technical School and Jesus College, Cambridge. He graduated from the latter in 1933 with a degree in mechanical sciences. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography describes his success in the tripos as \\"unparalleled\\"; he received a starred first and all available prizes, including the Rex Moir Prize and prizes for the best marks in Thermodynamics, Aeronautical Engineering and Structures, all in the same examination. Fox returned to the Engineering Department at Cambridge four years after graduating, having first served a stint as a technical assistant at Imperial Chemical Industries. He began as a demonstrator and became a fellow of King's College, Cambridge in 1941. Due to his teaching position he did not see active service in the Second World War, but he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the University Officer Training Corps, Royal Signals section, on 3 October 1942, a commission he resigned on 9 February 1946. In 1945, he became a lecturer in the Engineering Department at Cambridge. In that same year, on 2 March 1945, the university accepted an endowment to form a chemical engineering department by the Shell Group of Oil Companies, who would also sponsor a department chair. Though not established in the field, Fox was announced as the first to fill the chair position in June 1946. Fox spent several years preparing the department before beginning to accept students in 1948. He was a supportive chair, dedicated to financing and furthering the research of others, including the team of Francis Thomas Bacon when they developed the hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell. He remained in the position until 1959, when poor health forced him to retire, and was succeeded by Peter Victor Danckwerts. According to The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Fox's poor health was the result of a high stress personality, which led him to \\"a succession of nervous breakdowns in the early 1950s\\". He died at the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases in London on 5 October 1962. On 2 March 1963, the T.R.C. Fox Fund was established at Cambridge in tribute to his memory.

He was known by various names including Billi-billeri,Massola, p. 7. Billibellary, Jika Jika, Jacky Jacky and Jaga Jaga.Ellender and Christiansen, p. 35. He was an astute and diplomatic leader, described as powerfully built with an influence and reputation that extended well beyond his clan.Ellender and Christiansen, pp. 18‚Äì23.  Clan Territories  Billibellary's family lived on the north bank of the Yarra from Yarra Bend Park, and up Merri Creek. His brother, Burrenupton lived on the southern bank of the Yarra upstream of Gardiners Creek. Bebejan, also known as Jerrum Jerrum and was the father of William Barak, lived on the Yarra River from Heidelberg up to Mount Baw Baw. Mooney Mooney, a ngurungaeta of the Baluk-willam clan occupied land from the southeast of the Yarra River to Dandenong, Cranbourne and the marshes near Western Port.Ellender and Christiansen, p. 35. Old Ninggalobin, ngurungaeta of the Mount Macedon clan, shared joint custody with Billibellary of the Mount William Quarry which was a source of the highly valued greenstone hatchet heads, which were traded across a wide area as far as New South Wales and Adelaide.McBryde, pp. 267‚Äì285.Ellender and Christiansen, p. 44.Presland, p. ?. The Quarry had been in use for more than 1,500 years and covered 18 hectares including underground pits of several metres. In February 2008 the site was placed on the National heritage list for its cultural importance and archaeological value.National Heritage List, Mount William Stone Hatchet Quarry, Australian Government, Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. Accessed 3 November 2008 Ninggalobin, Poleorong and Billibellary were the leading song makers and principal Woi-Wurrung leaders in the Melbourne region. European colonisation had caused disruptions to initiation ceremonies. In response these three men gathered at South Yarra and inducted the young William Barak into Aboriginal lore. This entailed formally presenting Barak with the symbols of manhood: strips of possum-skin tied around his biceps; the gombert (reed necklace) around his neck; given his ilbi-jerri, a sharp and narrow bone or nosepeg; and his branjep, the apron worn by men to cover their genitals. At the end of the ceremony Barack presented his uncle, Billibellary, a possum-skin cloak.Ellender and Christiansen, p. 52.  Treaty  When John Batman explored the Yarra river and its tributaries he met Billibellary, one of the eight ngurungaeta he signed a treaty with on 8 June 1835. The meeting took place on the bank of a small stream, likely to be the Merri Creek and treaty documents were signed along with exchanges of goods by both sides.Batmania: The Deed, National Museum of Australia. Accessed 3 November 2008 For a purchase price including tomahawks, knives, scissors, flannel jackets, red shirts and a yearly tribute of similar items, Batman obtained about 200,000 hectares (2,000 square km) around the Yarra River and Corio Bay. The total value of the goods has been estimated at about GBP100 in the value of the day.Carolyn Web, History should have no divide, The Age, 3 June 2005. Accessed 3 November 2008 In return the Woiwurrung offered woven baskets of examples of their weaponry and two Possum-skin cloaks, a highly treasured item. After the treaty signing, a celebration took place with the Parramatta aborigines with Batman's party dancing a corroboree.Ellender and Christiansen, pp. 18‚Äì23. The treaty was significant as it was the first and only documented time when European settlers negotiated their presence and occupation of aboriginal lands.Broome, pp. 10‚Äì14. The Treaty was immediately repudiated by the colonial government in Sydney. The 1835 proclamation by Governor Richard Bourke implemented the doctrine of \\"terra nullius\\" upon which British settlement was based, reinforcing the concept that there was no prior land owner to British possession and that Aboriginal people could not sell or assign the land, and individuals could only acquire it through distribution by the Crown.National Archives of Australia, Governor Bourke's Proclamation 1835 (UK) Accessed 3 November 2008  Clash of Cultures  In response to tending an injury and caring for his son Simon Wonga for a period of two months in 1840, Billibellary named his newly born daughter Susannah in honour of Susannah Thomas, the wife of Assistant Protector William Thomas.Ellender and Christiansen, p. 32-3. In January 1840 near Arthurs Seat William Thomas promised the gathered Kulin clans government rations until they could set up a self-sufficient community, but Chief Protector George Augustus Robinson had refused to release government supplies. Fearing for his wife and children Thomas spoke to Billibellary and explained the non-arrival of the rations, and asked for protection for his wife and children. Even though Billibellary was out of his territory, his authority was unquestioned. Thomas reported that Billibellary said Very good that Mr Fawkner and Batman...Big one Gammon (pretend) your Mr Robinson and Government. Susannah Thomas released all the stores she could spare and Billibellary ordered the clans to split up into smaller groups for foraging.Ellender and Christiansen, pp. 68‚Äì9. On the instructions of Charles La Trobe a Native Police Corps was established and underwritten by the government in 1842 in the hope of civilising the Aboriginal men. As senior Wurundjeri elder, Billibellary' co-operation for the proposal was important for its success, and after deliberation he backed the initiative and even proposed himself for enlistment. He donned the uniform and enjoyed the status of parading through the camp, but was careful to avoid active duty as a policeman to avoid a conflict of interest between his duties as a Wurundjeri ngurungaeta. Participation in the police corps also failed to stop troopers participating in tribal ceremonies, gatherings and rituals.Ellender and Christiansen, p. 88. After about a year Billibellary resigned from the Native Police Corps when he found that it was to be used to capture and even kill other natives. He did his best from then to undermine the Corps and as a result many native troopers deserted and few remained longer than three or four years.Wiencke, p. ?. In 1845 a school was established on the banks of the Merri Creek to, in European terms, educate and civilise Wurundjeri children. For the first year or two the school enjoyed strong enrolments, largely due to the support and encouragement of Billibellary, who sent his own children along. But there were conflicts over teaching European curriculum and the demands for the teaching of Aboriginal lore and ceremony. The death of Billibellary in 1846 led to a drop in student numbers at the school, with many students drifting away and others becoming disruptive.Ellender and Christiansen, pp. 94‚Äì7.  Death  Billibellary died on 10 August 1846 of inflammation of the lungs, an ailment which killed many of his people in the period after contact with Europeans. Billibellary was buried at the confluence of the Merri Creek and the Yarra river (Birrarang) near Dights Falls.Ellender and Christiansen, pp. 106‚Äì7. His passing was lamented by Thomas who had developed a deep friendship and mutal respect across cultures. He wrote of Billibellary after his death: \\"It may be said of this Chief and his tribe what can scarce be said of any tribe of located parts of the colony that they never shed white man's blood nor have white men shed their blood. I have lost in this man a valuable councillor in Aboriginal affairs.\\"Broome, p. 33. After his death, his son Simon Wonga became ngurungaeta of the Wurundjeri-willam clan.Ellender and Christiansen, p. 112.

As its title indicates, the book is an entry in the series of books about the Land of Oz written by L. Frank Baum and a host of successors. The book Paradox in Oz was published by Hungry Tiger Press, with illustrations by Eric Shanower. It was playwright Einhorn's first novel and first Oz book. (His second in both categories, The Living House of Oz, would appear in 2005.) The publication of Paradox in Oz was timed to coincide with the centennial of the original Oz book, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (as was also true of Gina Wickwar's The Hidden Prince of Oz and Dave Hardenbrook's The Unknown Witches of Oz). Einhorn's novel was warmly received and widely praised upon its initial publication,Edward Einhorn, The Golem, Methuselah, and Shylock: Plays by Edward Einhorn, New York, Theater 61 Press, 2005; p. 3. as were Shanower's illustrations; a review in Asimov's Science Fiction called it a \\"gorgeous book.\\" Genre In Paradox in Oz Einhorn maintains a fidelity to the benign utopian fantasy of Baum's Oz novels, though he also acknowledges the darker revisionist vein explored in contemporary books like Geoff Ryman's Was and Gregory Maguire's Wicked trilogy. Einhorn constructs an alternate, dystopian version of Oz,Richard Carl Truek, Oz in Perspective, Jefferson, NC, McFarland, 2007; pp. 103-4. an Obsidian City in contrast to Baum's Emerald City. Einhorn's book is also notable for its use of science fiction elements, principally time travel. There is a science fiction thread that winds through Baum's work,George E. Slusser and Eric S. Rabkin, eds., Intersections: Fantasy and Science Fiction, Carbondale, IL, Southern Illinois University Press, 1987. manifested in non-Oz books like The Master Key but also in the Oz stories, with robots (Tik-Tok of Oz), domed cities (Glinda of Oz), and other features. Critics have remarked on the interest in and acceptance of technology that sets Baum's Oz apart from earlier fantasy domains.Paul Nathanson, Over the Rainbow: The Wizard of Oz as a Secular Myth of America, Albany, NY, State University of New York Press Press, 1991.Marius Bewley, Masks & Mirrors: Essays in Criticism, New York, Atheneum, 1970.Suzanne Rahn, The Wizard of Oz: Shaping an Imaginary World, New York, Twayne, 1998. Synopsis As the novel opens, inhabitants of Oz are suddenly noticing unusual signs of aging. Omby Amby finds a white hair in his luxurious green beard, and common citizens confront wrinkles and back problems. Ozma and her advisers realize that the magic anti-aging spell, which has prevailed in Oz throughout her reign, has now stopped working. In their attempt to figure out why, Ozma and Glinda consult the Great Book of Records, but find cryptic references to the \\"Man Who Lives Backwards.\\" (This person is actually living in Glinda's palace at the moment; but since he lives backwards, he is a baby in the present time, and cannot explain himself to them.) In trying to puzzle out the problem, Ozma and Glinda confront a Parrot-Ox -- a large magic creature, half parrot and half ox. \\"Its front half was covered with red, blue, and green plumage, and out from among its feathers proudly emerged a bright yellow beak. Two large, orange wings rested against its body, which was a speckled brown, and it had a long black tail with a feathered end. It stood upon four hooved feet, and its dark eyes darted nervously around the room, dismayed at being discovered.\\" They learn that these creatures, normally invisible, are amazingly common; they co-exist with us in our everyday lives. A Parrot-Ox is \\"capable of doing nothing at all, unless it is impossible.\\" This particular Parrot-Ox calls himself Tempus. To resolve the mystery of the aging of Oz, Ozma rides Tempus back in time, to meet her predecessor King Oz in the forest surrounding the Forbidden Fountain. She encounters a curious person called Dr. Majestico, and she accidentally changes the past so that Oz becomes an evil place, ruled by a tyrannical Wizard from an Obsidian City, a negative-image of her own Emerald City. She must deal with altered versions of her familiar friends: the beautiful Glinda is old and worn, while the Tin Woodman is a human and very malevolent headsman, Nick Chopper. In her efforts to remedy the situation, Ozma takes more and more trips into the past; the woods around the Forbidden Fountain are soon filled with Ozmas from different times. Ozma must confront Tip, her own earlier male self, and take a journey to Absurd City to find the Man Who Lives Backwards; she must face mind-boggling confusions, and numerous Parrot-Oxes, before she can restore the familiar world she knows and loves. Ozian allusions Fans of Oz will find subtle allusions in Einhorn's text. In Chapter Six, for example, Tempus tells Ozma that he remembers things that \\"never happened,\\" such as \\"when East used to be West and West used to be East....\\"Paradox in Oz, p. 67. This is a reference to a major and well-known contradiction in the Oz literature. In the second chapter of the original Oz book, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Baum specifically places the Munchkin Country in the eastern section of Oz;L. Frank Baum, The Annotated Wizard of Oz, Edited with an Introduction and Notes by Michael Patrick Hearn; revised edition, New York, W. W. Norton, 2000; pp. 60-1, and illustration facing p. xlix. Dorothy's house famously kills the Wicked Witch of the East when it lands on her there. Yet in later books, Tik-Tok of Oz and The Lost Princess of Oz, maps show the Munchkin Country in the west. In Obsidian City, the alternative version of Omby Amby calls himself Wantowin Battles -- a name introduced by Ruth Plumly Thompson in her Ozoplaning with the Wizard of Oz (1939). When dealing with Dorothy, the Evil Version of the Wizard makes a reference to the 1939 movie version, by reversing part of the Wizard's dialog, describing himself, as \\"a very bad man, but I am a very good wizard,\\" before performing a wicked spell on the girl. The illustrations Eric Shanower's black-and-white illustrations for Paradox in Oz are faithful to the richly romantic style that Shanower has developed for Oz illustration, from The Enchanted Apples of Oz (1986) on. Yet for pertinent incidents in Einhorn's text, Shanower expands his style to include elements of pop art and op art, and allusions to the work of M. C. Escher.Paradox in Oz, pp. 165, 173, 175.

Biography  As a teenager, Geyer worked as an apprentice-gardener in Zabeltitz, and in 1830 became an assistant at the botanical gardens in Dresden. From 1835 to 1844 he performed botanical studies on several expeditions within the United States. In 1838-40 he worked as a botanist in the Upper Midwest for geographer Joseph Nicollet (1786-1843), and in 1841-42 collected plants in Illinois, Missouri and the Iowa Territory for botanist George Engelmann (1809-1884). Afterwards he joined explorer William Drummond Stewart (1795-1871) on an expedition through the present-day states of Nebraska and Wyoming. Eventually, Geyer parted company with Stewart, and performed extensive botanical research in what would later be known as the Oregon Territory. The plant specimens Geyer collected in 1843-44 were supposed to be sent to George Engelmann in exchange for Engelmann paying most of the expense of outfitting Geyer for the journey. However, Geyer left the U.S. west coast by boat, and sailed to England, delivering the plant specimens to William J. Hooker at Kew instead. In 1845 he returned to Germany, where he purchased land in Meissen and started a nursery. During his later years, he was an editor of the horticultural journal Die Cronik des Gartenwesens.JSTOR Plant Science (biography) Geyer has a number of plant species named after him, including Allium geyeri (Geyer's onion) and Euphorbia geyeri (Geyer's spurge).

The mountain is part of the Cordillera Central mountain range on Luzon island, the largest island in the country. Binuluan exhibits active volcanism through numerous fumarole fields, solfataras and hot springs on its slope. There were reports of possible eruptions in 1952 and 1986 (or 1987), but they are unverified. Geography Mount Binuluan [Bin-oo-loo-ahn (Lubuaganyen dialect)] is one of the highest peaks in the area. The mountain is surrounded by the municipalities of Lubuagan, Pasil and Tinglayan in Kalinga province. Pasil River Valley northwest of Mount Binuluan with the slopes of Binuluan in the foreground Southeast of the mountain is the Chico River flowing from southwest to northeast direction, while due northwest of the mountain is Pasil River, also flowing from southwest to northeast direction merging with Chico River just past the mountain. Mount Binuluan belongs to a range of mountains situated between the two rivers, trending southwest to northeast. Just southwest of Binuluan is Mount Mosimus , followed by Mount Cauitan and Mount Alchan (Alchanon) , the 19th and 20th tallest mountain in the Philippines.\\"Bontoc Topographical Map\\".

The village of Bangtitan in Upper Uma in Lubuagan is a good vantage point for views and photography of the mountain on the rare occasions when the primary peak is not mist-enshrouded. It is not known if Binuluan itself has ever been climbed as access to the site is very difficult. The terrain is rugged and undeveloped. There has been some geological surveying related to the Batong Buhay gold mining activities in Pasil, but the locals say no one has ever climbed or surveyed Binuluan because it is \\"too far away\\", \\"there's no reason to go there\\", \\"it is too difficult climbing that\\", and \\"even the geologists didn't bother\\". Groundwork in 2007 and 2008 as part of a comprehensive systematic survey, shows volcanic-related activities around Binuluan, from northwestward of the peak, going counterclockwise, to eastward side of the peak. Further groundwork was abandoned due to tribal conflicts on the southwest flank (Tinglayan-Tulgao tribal conflict), and unrelated intertribal conflicts on the northwest and northeast flanks (Upper Uma-Lubuagan conflict).

There are a number of sites with strong steam emission, fumarolic activity, surface sulfur deposits, hot fresh water springs, hot sulfurous water springs, sulfur staining of riverine rocks, poisonous gas emissions, recent volcanic gas related deaths (>100 in last 20 years at Batong Buhay mines alone), heat destruction of vegetation, poisonous water, fumarole fields with new and shifting activity. =Bu-ot Fumarole Field= The Bu-ot Fumarole Field (Balatoc dialect) is located on Balatoc tribal land, along the Pasil River on the steep western valley slope, with the path going up to Balatoc village immediately to the right of the fumarole field. Image:Bu-ot80420cga.jpgBu-ot Fumarole Field Image:Bu-ot80420cgb.jpgSteep-sided Bu-ot Fumarole Field Image:PasilRiver80420acg.jpgHeavily sulfur-stained Pasil River, upstream from Bu-ot Fumarole Field The steep area is located at approximately at an elevation of about above sea level. There are two active steam vents with yellow sulfuric water flowing out, as well as from some other locations in the field, down to the Pasil River. The rocks along the Pasil River are heavily stained orange-yellow both upstream and downstream from the Bu-ot fumarole field. =Bum-bag Fumarole Fields= Bum-bag fumarole fields [pron. Boom-bag (Balatoc dialect)], (or Djum-ag in Upper Uma dialect), are located approximately east of Bu-ot, on Batong Buhay tribal land in Pasil. The fields are on the eastern side of the Pasil River valley at an elevation of about above sea level. One walks through the Bum-bag rice terraces located at an elevation of about , to get to the fumarole fields. The fields though are located in a private property. The owner of the property reported that the underground rattling, banging, and explosions stopped years ago, but h7awrestdfyuhiuytreghjklrf m-bag fumarole fields appear to be consistent with the GVP's 'Bumabag Volcano', but it is located west of the summit, not east.

Field May 4 be consistent with the GVP's 'Podakan Volcano'. There were broad swathes of bare ground between the numbered fields where all vegetation was absent except broken scorched trunks of mature pine tree. Besides the four fields, there could be another field over the ridge to the north of field 1, but it is unexplored. =Sugo-oc fumarole field= Sugo-oc Fumarole Field The Sugo-oc fumarole field could be seen and photographed from the southern side of Binuluan in Bunog River valley, along the Tinglayan- Tulgao road. Unfortunately mist, cloud, and intermittent rain could easily prevent all photography. The fumarole field can be accessed through Dananao, Tulgao or Sumadel in Tinglayan. Hot Springs Numerous hot springs, both fresh water, and sulfurous water, exist in a wide half ring around the south and western sides of Binuluan. Bu-ot fumarole field, Bum-bag fumarole fields, and Sugu-oc fumarole field, all have hot sulfurous water springs. Along the Pasil River upstream from Bu-ot, six hot sulfurous water springs and one fumarole are said to be located. Sun-ut Sulfur Spring (centre) =Sun-ut hot spring= Downstream from Bu-ot on the Sun-ut River below the village of Ag- agama, is the Sun-ut hot sulfur water spring. The local priest in Ag-agama says there used to be a natural bowl on the banks of the Sun-ut River into which the spring flowed and in which the people of Ag-agama bathed daily. But a typhoon-induced flooding of the Sun-ut river washed away the bowl and now the spring flows directly into the river. The spring is located on private property, the owner, living in Ag-agama. Further information from locals may disclose the other hot water springs in tributaries off the Pasil River upstream from Bu-ot. Bunog Falls and Hot Springs =Bunog Falls and hot springs= Along the Bunog River, downstream from Bunog Falls below Tulgao West, are numerous hot sulfurous springs. The first spring is visible from Bunog Falls, about downstream from the Bunog Falls' hot freshwater springs. According to Tulgao and Tinglayan locals, there was a hot salt water spring on the Bunog River which used to be harvested and the water 'cooked' (evaporated) to produce salt, before the Cordillera Highway was first blazed. Also, according to them, one of the springs is poisonous killing animals and birds which drink from it. There are no paths along the Bunog River to get to the other springs. Locals in Tinglayan and Lubuagan do not know any other hot sulfur water springs in the Chico River or its tributaries other than Bunog River. Possible eruptions A possible phreatic or steam eruption was reported from Mount Binuluan in 1952, during which a sulfur-rich debris flow killed a dozen people. Details about the eruption in 1952 are still scant. In 2007 and 2008, some 90- and 100-year-old elders in Brgy. Tulgao in Tinglayan said the loss of life in 1952 was caused by an eruption during a typhoon followed with the collapse of a natural earth bank below Sugo-oc fumarole field, high on the northern side of the Bunog River. The consequent mudslide buried a few houses below near the villages of Dananao and Sumadel, Tinglayan, killing maybe 12 people or thereabouts. In 2007 and 2008, people in southern Kalinga around Binuluan spoke of an 'eruption' at Sugo-oc in 1986 or 1987. During the Abra earthquake at 20:16 hours on Sunday, January 13, 2008, buildings in Tinglayan shook and windows rattled for about 10 seconds. When speaking in English, the locals there at the time called this an 'eruption'. Gentle questioning of locals over months led to the conclusion that there are difficulties in communicating the difference between an eruption and an earthquake. There were reports about that earthquake of 1986, which was felt also felt throughout the municipality of Lubuagan, was simultaneous with an eruption at Sugo-oc resulting in the ejection of ash and rock. Three people in Dananao village were killed by the ejected rocks. Because of these, there was a large migration out of the village with the Dananao people taking possession of a land along the Tubuk-to-Aurora Road in eastern Kalinga and resettling there.

Note the T-bar on top for adjusting the compression A carbureted compression ignition model engine, popularly known as a model diesel engine, is a simple compression ignition engine made for model propulsion, usually model aircraft but also model boats. These are quite similar to the typical glow-plug engine that runs on a mixture of methanol- based fuels with a hot wire filament to provide ignition. Despite their name, their use of compression ignition, and the use of a kerosene fuel that is similar to diesel, model diesels share very little with full-size diesel engines. Comparison with full-size engines Full-size diesel engines, such as those found in a truck, are fuel injected and either two-stroke or four- stroke. They use compression ignition to ignite the mixture: the compression within the cylinder heats the inlet charge sufficiently to cause ignition, without requiring any external ignition source. A fundamental feature of such engines, unlike petrol (gasoline) engines, is that they draw in air alone and the fuel is only mixed by being injected into the combustion chamber separately. Model diesel engines are instead a carbureted two-stroke using the crankcase for charge-air compression. The carburetor supplies a mixture of fuel and air into the engine, with the proportions kept fairly constant and their total volume throttled to control the engine power. Apart from sharing the diesel's use of compression ignition, their construction has more in common with a small two-stroke motorcycle or lawnmower engine. Variable compression Model diesels have variable compression ratios. This variable compression is achieved by a \\"contra-piston,\\" at the top of the cylinder, which can be adjusted by a screwed \\"T-bar\\". The swept volume of the engine remains the same, but as the volume of the combustion chamber at top dead center is changed by adjusting the contra-piston, the compression ratio (swept volume + combustion chamber / combustion chamber) changes accordingly. There also exist model diesels with fixed compression heads. A few examples are the British 5 cc OWAT or the American DRONE. These engines have a fixed compression ratio, but the compression can be altered slightly with the use of more or less lubrication oil in the fuel. Also the engine's load affects the compression and ignition timing. Larger propellers give a longer combustion time and so higher compression. Smaller propellers reduce the load, and therefore the compression pressure build up, which changes the ignition timing to earlier. Advantages Model diesels are found to produce more torque than glow engines of the same displacement, and are thought to get better fuel efficiency, because the same power is produced at lower rpm, and in a smaller displacement engine. However, the specific power may not be significantly superior to a glow engine, due to the heavier construction needed to assure that the engine can withstand the much higher compression ratio, sometimes as high as 30:1. Diesels also run significantly quieter, due to the more rapid combustion, unlike glow engines, in which combustion may still be occurring when the exhaust ports are uncovered, causing a significant amount of noise. Disadvantages Compared to glow plug engines, model diesels are more difficult to throttle over a wide range of powers, making them less suitable for radio-controlled models than either two or four stroke glow-plug engines although this difference is claimed to be less noticeable with the use of modern schnuerle-ported engines.  Fuel  These \\"diesels\\" run on a mixture of kerosene, ethanol, ether, castor oil or vegetable oil, and cetane or amyl nitrite booster. The fuel used contains Diethyl ether, which is highly volatile and has an extremely low flash point, combined with kerosene and a lubricant plus a very small proportion (typically 2%) of ignition improver such as Amyl nitrite or preferably Isopropyl nitrate nowadays.  Starting  The engine is started by reducing the compression and setting the spray bar mixture rich with the adjustable needle valve, gradually increasing the compression while cranking the engine. The compression is increased until the engine starts running. The mixture can then be leaned out and the compression increased. Compared to glow plug engines, model diesel engines exhibit much higher fuel economy, thus increasing endurance for the amount of fuel carried. They also exhibit higher torque, enabling the turning of a larger or higher pitched propeller at lower speed. Since the combustion occurs well before the exhaust port is uncovered, these engines are also considerably quieter (when unmuffled) than glow-plug engines of similar displacement.

These roads typically follow along local streets often along a former U.S. route or state highway that had been replaced by an Interstate. Interstate business route reassurance markers are signed as either loops or spurs using a green shield shaped and numbered like the shield of the parent Interstate highway. Along Interstate 10 (I-10), business routes are found in the four westernmost states through which I-10 passes: California, Arizona, New Mexico, and the far western region of Texas beyond the Pecos River. Although I-10 is a transcontinental highway, none of the states to the east along the Interstate have yet to designate I-10 business routes. Some states regard Interstate business routes as fully integrated within their state highway system while other states consider them to be either local roads to be maintained by county or municipal authorities or a hybrid of state and local control. Although the public may differentiate between different business routes by the number of the parent route and the location of the route, there is no uniform naming convention. Each state highway department internally uses its own designations to identify segments within its jurisdiction. California Interstate business routes in California are assigned by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), but are not maintained by Caltrans unless they overlay other routes of the state highway system. Local authorities may request route assignment from the Caltrans Transportation System Information Program, and all requests require approval of the executive committee of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). =Blythe business loop= Interstate 10 Business is a business loop of I-10 at Blythe in Riverside County. The route begins at I-10 Exit 236 and goes to the north along Neighbours Boulevard. The route turns to the east along Hobsonway through town, then crosses underneath I-10 just before the Colorado River at the Arizona state line and emerges from the underpass as Riviera Drive where the route reconnects with I-10 at Exit 243\\\\. The business loop has major intersections with US 95 and SR 78. The route was formerly designated as part of US 60/US 70 except along Neighbours Blvd. The eastern part of the route also conveyed US 95. ;Major intersections Arizona The business loops within Arizona are maintained by the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) and by municipal authorities. Interstate 10 (I-10) has five business loops within the state including one in La Paz County, the westernmost in Arizona through which I-10 passes, and four in Cochise County, the easternmost. ADOT identifies Interstate business loops as State Business Routes followed by the number of the parent Interstate. Therefore, all I-10 business loops in Arizona carry the unsigned designation of Arizona State Route 10 Business (or State Business Route 10). Individual loops along an Interstate are designated by adding parenthetical numbers that increase eastward and northward. Gaps in numbering represent removal of former routes or potential expansion. Many of the business loops are sections of highways which preceded I-10, such as U.S. Route 60, U.S. Route 70, U.S. Route 80 and State Route 86. =Quartzsite business loop= State Business Route 10 (1) (also known as SR 10 Bus.) is a business loop of I-10 at Quartzsite in La Paz County operated since 1991. The route, which follows along the local streets Quartzsite Boulevard, Main Street, and Riggles Avenue, begins at Exit 17 of I-10 and U.S. Route 95 (US 95) west of town and ends at Exit 24 of I-10 east of town. Between its termini, the route has a major intersection with State Route 95 (SR 95) where it ends a concurrency with US 95. The route was originally designated along part of US 60 and US 70. ;Major intersections =Phoenix business loop= State Business Route 10 (Phoenix) (also known as SR 10 Bus.) was a business loop of I-10 at Phoenix, in Maricopa County, decommissioned circa 1990. Prior to the completion of I-10 through Phoenix, this business loop connected the eastern and western segments of the Interstate on a route through Downtown Phoenix. Prior to its decommissioning, the route began at I-10 exit 142 (27th Avenue), heading south before turning east at Van Buren Street. At the five-legged intersection with Grand Avenue and 7th Avenue, I-10 BL began a concurrency with US 60 & US 89. This concurrency ended as I-10 BL turned right at 44th Street, heading south again before terminating at I-10 exit 153 (48th Street). The 44th Street leg of the Phoenix I-10 BL has since been replaced by part of the Hohokam Expressway (SR 143). ;Major intersections Major highway intersections as listed shortly before I-10 BL was decommissioned in 1990. =Tucson business loop= State Business Route 10 (2) (also known as SR 10 Bus.) was a business loop of I-10 at Tucson in Pima County operated between 1972 and 2001. The route followed Benson Highway through the south end of Tucson, starting at Exit 262 in town and ended at Exit 267 east of town. Between its terminii, the route made a quick jog down Irvington Road near Tucson Boulevard to stay on Benson Highway and used a small section of Valencia Road at the end of Benson Highway to access Exit 267. The route was formerly designated as part of US 80 and SR 86. Maintenance of the route was transferred to the city of Tucson upon decommissioning. ;Major intersections =Benson business loop= State Business Route 10 (3) (also known as SR 10 Bus.) is a business loop of I-10 at Benson in Cochise County operated since 1974. The route follows along Benson's Fourth Street beginning at Exit 303 of I-10 west of town and ends at Exit 306 of I-10 east of town. Between its termini, the route has a major intersection with SR 80. The western part of the business loop from I-10 to SR 80 is signed as part of Historic US 80. The route was originally designated along part of SR 86 while US 80 was conveyed over a portion of the present business route. ;Major intersections =Benson business spur= State Route 10 Spur (also known as SR 10 Spur) was a business spur of I-10 at Benson in Cochise County operated from 1969 to 1999. The route followed Ocotillo Road south from I-10 before ending at 4th Street (I-10 BL) west of downtown Benson. Maintenance of the route was transferred to the city of Benson upon decommissioning. ;Major intersections =Willcox business loop= State Business Route 10 (4) (also known as SR 10 Bus.) is a business loop of I-10 at Willcox in Cochise County operated since 1986. The route, following along Willcox's Haskell Avenue, begins at Exit 336 of I-10 west of town and ends at Exit 344 of I-10 east of town. Between its termini, the route has a brief concurrency with SR 186. The route was formerly designated as part of US 666 and SR 86. ;Major intersections =Bowie business loop= State Business Route 10 (5) (also known as SR 10 Bus.) is a business loop of I-10 at Bowie in Cochise County operated since 1980. The route along Sixth Street in Bowie begins at Exit 362 of I-10 west of town and ends at Exit 366 of I-10 east of town. Between its termini, the route has no major intersections. The route was formerly designated as part of SR 86. ;Major intersections =San Simon business loop= State Business Route 10 (6) (also known as SR 10 Bus.) is a business loop of I-10 at San Simon in Cochise County operated since 1961. The route follows San Simon's Sixth Street beginning at Exit 378 of I-10 west of town and ending at Exit 382 of I-10 east of town. Between its termini, the route has no major intersections. The route was formerly designated as part of SR 86. ;Major intersections New Mexico All of the business loops within New Mexico are maintained by the New Mexico Department of Transportation (NMDOT). In New Mexico, Interstate business routes are named independently of their parent Interstate's designation with business loops of Interstate 25 (I-25) numbered between 10‚Äì19, those of I-10 between 20‚Äì29, and those of I-40 between 30‚Äì39. New Mexico business loop numbers ascend eastward and northward with gaps in numbering to allow for future designations. Within New Mexico, I-10 currently has business routes in Lordsburg and Deming. =Lordsburg business loop= Business Loop 21 is a business loop of Interstate 10 at Lordsburg in Hidalgo County. The route, which follows the city's Motel Drive, begins at Exit 20 of I-10 west of town and ends at Exit 24 of I-10 and U.S. Route 70 (US 70) east of town. Between its termini, the route has major intersections with US 70 and New Mexico State Road 494 (NM 494). The route was originally designated as part of US 80 while a portion of the business route also conveyed US 70. ;Major intersections =Deming business loop= Business Loop 22 is a business loop of Interstate 10 at Deming in Luna County. The route begins at Exit 81 of I-10 and US 70 west of town and follows Pine Street and Motel Drive to Exit 85 of I-10, US 70, and US 180 east of town. Between its termini, the route has major intersections with US 180, NM 418, and NM 549. The route was originally designated as part of US 70 and US 80 while a portion of the business route also conveyed US 180. ;Major intersections Texas All of the business loops within Texas are maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). Interstate 10 has four business loops in the state, each located in the far western Trans-Pecos region. Along I-10, TxDOT identifies each business route as Business Interstate 10 followed by an alphabetic suffix. Along Texas Interstates, the alphabetic suffixes on business route names ascend eastward and northward. There are gaps in the alphabetic values to allow for future system expansion. The alphabetic naming suffixes are included as small letters on the bottom of reassurance shields. =Sierra Blanca business loop= Business Interstate 10-C or Bus. I-10-C is a business loop of Interstate 10 at Sierra Blanca in Hudspeth County commissioned in 1991. The route follows El Paso Street beginning at Exit 105 on I-10 west of town and ending at Exit 108 on I-10 east of town. The route has one major intersection with Ranch to Market Road 1111 (RM 1111) to Cornudas and Dell City. left The road was originally designated as part of US 80 (US 80). After October 15, 1965, the road was designated Texas State Highway Loop 416, although it was signed as a business route of US 80\\\\. This became the present Business I-10 designation on June 21, 1990. ;Major intersections =Van Horn business loop= Bus. I-10-D in Van Horn Business Interstate 10-D or Bus.

Herbert's concepts and inventions have been analyzed and deconstructed in at least one book, The Science of Dune (2008). Herbert's originating 1965 novel Dune is popularly considered one of the greatest science fiction novels of all time,Touponce, William F. (1988), Frank Herbert, Boston, Massachusetts: Twayne Publishers imprint, G. K. Hall & Co, pg. 119, . \\"Locus ran a poll of readers on April 15, 1975 in which Dune 'was voted the all-time best science-fiction novel‚Ä¶It has sold over ten million copies in numerous editions.'\\" and is frequently cited as the best-selling science fiction novel in history. Dune and its five sequels by Herbert explore the complex and multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology and technology, among other themes. The Butlerian Jihad, an event in the back- story of Herbert's universe, leads to the outlawing of certain technologies, primarily \\"thinking machines\\", a collective term for computers and artificial intelligence of any kind. This prohibition is a key influence on the nature of Herbert's fictional setting. In Dune, ten thousand years after this jihad, its enduring commandment remains, \\"Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.\\" Atomics Atomics is the term used to refer to nuclear weapons in the Dune universe. Like real-world nuclear weapons, atomics presumably derive their destructive force from nuclear reactions of fission or fusion, and Herbert notes that \\"radiation lingers\\" after their use. However, the author never delves into the specifics of the technology or explores in detail how it may have evolved by the time of Dune's far-future setting. In the initial Dune novels, the Great Houses of the Landsraad own \\"family atomics\\" as heirlooms, keeping a secure, hidden cache as weapons of last resort in their wars. Though such possession is necessary to secure power, the use of atomics against humans violates the chief prohibition of the Great Convention, the \\"universal truce enforced under the power balance maintained by the Guild, the Great Houses, and the Imperium\\". Paul Atreides notes in Dune that \\"The language of the Great Convention is clear enough: Use of atomics against humans shall be cause for planetary obliteration.\\" The atomics themselves act as a military deterrent‚Äîany House which violates the Great Convention flagrantly (such as using atomics openly in warfare) faces massive retaliation from any number of the other Houses. As Paul notes via epigraph in Dune Messiah (1969), \\"any Family in my Empire could so deploy its atomics as to destroy the planetary bases of fifty or more other Families\\". A stone burner is a conventional weapon that uses atomics for fuel. Whether they are covered by the Great Convention is discussed several times in the series, with the opinion that while they \\"skirt the intentions of the law\\" they do not warrant retaliation. The explosion and radiation can be precisely adjusted depending on the desired effect. Stone burners emit \\"J-Rays\\", a form of radiation that has a tendency to destroy the eye tissue of anyone surviving the initial radiation blast. If of sufficient power, a stone burner can burn its way into the core of a planet, destroying it: =The original series= In Dune, Paul uses an atomic device on the surface of Arrakis to blast a pass through a wild desert mountain range called the Shield Wall. He considers this act to be in accordance with the Great Convention because the atomics are not used against humans, but rather against \\"a natural feature of the desert\\". A stone burner is used in an attempt to assassinate Paul in Dune Messiah; he survives but is blinded for the rest of his life. In God Emperor of Dune (1981), the God Emperor Leto II notes that since his 3,500-year reign began he has \\"searched out all of the Family atomics and removed them to a safe place\\". =Prequels= In the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson (1999‚Äì2001) it is revealed that a renegade House of the Landsraad had devastated the capital of the Corrino Padishah Empire, Salusa Secundus, with atomics and rendered the planet essentially uninhabitable. Padishah Emperor Hassik Corrino III had relocated the Imperial throne to the planet Kaitain, and the attacking House had been subsequently exterminated. During the events of the series in 10,175 A.G., Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV uses atomics to destroy House Richese's artificial laboratory moon of Korona. Part of Shaddam's plan to ensure his own spice monopoly, the explosion causes a quarter of the planet Richese's population to go blind from the resulting light produced by the destruction of the Richesian mirrors stored on Korona. Finally, the persecuted Earl Dominic Vernius plans to use atomics to attack Kaitain; when his hidden base on Arrakis is discovered by the Padishah Emperor's Sardaukar army, Vernius ignites a stone burner to destroy himself and as many of the Sardaukar as he can. The Legends of Dune prequel series (2002‚Äì2004) establishes that the first human victory of the Butlerian Jihad (the crusade against the thinking machines) is the 200 B.G. destruction of Earth and the Earth Omnius using atomics. \\"Pulse atomics\\" calibrated for use against the gel circuitry of the thinking machines are also used at the end of the war to systematically wipe out every single machine-controlled planet. It is this action, and the millions of human slaves who are killed in it, which ultimately leads to the ban on atomic warfare in the Great Convention. It also contributes to the development of the feud between the Harkonnens and Atreides. Axlotl tank Axlotl tanks are a fictional technology in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. Axlotl technology is also mentioned in Herbert's novels Destination: Void and The Jesus Incident but not elaborated upon. The name is presumably derived from the axolotl, an aquatic salamander native to Mexico known for its regenerative abilities. A trade secret of the Tleilaxu, an axlotl tank is a \\"device for reproducing a living human being from the cells of a cadaver\\", a type of clone called a ghola. Axlotl tanks are semi-artificial uteri created by transforming women into biological factories. Later in the series, the Tleilaxu scientists also use the axlotl tanks to replicate the spice melange, previously only available on the desert planet Arrakis where it is created naturally as part of the life cycle of giant sandworms. =The original series= The tanks are briefly mentioned in Dune: Messiah (1969) as the source of the Duncan Idaho ghola. Their nature is a well-guarded Tleilaxu secret. During his 3500-year reign which ends in God Emperor of Dune (1981), Leto II purchases countless Idaho gholas produced for him in the tanks. Within the 1500 years between the events of God Emperor of Dune and Heretics of Dune (1984), the Tleilaxu discover an artificial method of producing the spice melange in their axlotl tanks as well. Some melange users, like the Bene Gesserit, prefer the natural melange of Arrakis to the Tleilaxu substitute, claiming increased potency. In Heretics of Dune, Miles Teg recalls how his Bene Gesserit mother Lady Janet had said that \\"No one outside of [the Tleilaxu] planets has ever reported seeing a Tleilaxu female.\\" Wondering whether the Tleilaxu breed or simply rely on the tanks to reproduce, Miles had asked, \\"Do they exist or is it just the tanks?\\" Janet confirmed that females do indeed exist. Later in Heretics, Teg's own daughter, Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade, theorizes that the axlotl tanks may be, in fact, \\"surrogate mothers\\"‚ÄîTleilaxu females somehow transformed. Soon, the current Duncan ghola recalls his repeated \\"births\\" from the tanks: In Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), the last remaining Tleilaxu Master Scytale is coerced into revealing the means of creating the tanks to the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood. =Sequels= In Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007), the novels by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson which complete Frank Herbert's original series, the Bene Gesserit on the no-ship Ithaca use the captive Scytale's knowledge to create their own axlotl tanks from Bene Gesserit volunteers. The Rabbi, leader of the group of \\"secret\\" Jews on board, is upset when his follower Rebecca, a \\"wild\\" Reverend Mother, volunteers herself for the process. =Prelude to Dune= In the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy (1999‚Äì2001) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson (set immediately prior to the events of 1965's Dune), the Tleilaxu attempt to create artificial melange called ajidamal using axlotl technology; the best results are gained by using a Bene Gesserit sister to create an axlotl tank. However, the project ultimately fails. Cymek A cymek is a type of cyborg, or machine-human hybrid, in the fictional Dune prequel universe. They appear in the Legends of Dune prequel trilogy (2002‚Äì2004) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. The only organic part of a cymek is its brain; in the series, living humans willingly have their brains transplanted into large mechanized bodies with the intent of extending life indefinitely. The technology is later revived in the prequel novel Mentats of Dune (2014). =Legends of Dune= Over 11,000 years before the events of Frank Herbert's Dune (1965), a group of 20 ambitious humans see the stagnation of the Old Empire and realize that their small band can take control of it with the aid of thinking machines. Calling themselves the Titans, they rule humanity for a hundred years and rename themselves after famous historical and mythological figures, most notably Agamemnon, Ajax, Barbarossa, Dante, Hecate, Juno, Tlaloc and Xerxes. Ten years into their reign, their leader Tlaloc is killed in a freak accident. Realizing their mortality and limited lifespans, they seek a way to extend their lives. Juno is inspired by the cogitors, ancient philosophers whose brains had been installed in fluid-filled canisters so that they might analyze the universe indefinitely; they are living and retain awareness and consciousness, and the ability to communicate should they choose. The Titan Agamemnon is the first to become a cymek, his brain transplanted into a canister which, through special interfaces, is installed into a large, fearsome, and weaponized body. In cymek form, the remaining 19 Titans are virtually unstoppable, and continue their tyrannical rule of the universe for another 90 years. Growing complacent, the Titans are themselves overthrown and enslaved by Omnius, a sentient computer network given too much autonomy; Omnius controls the universe for the next 900 years. The Titans recruit humans from the enslaved, Omnius-controlled \\"Synchronized Worlds\\" to become neo-cymeks, footsoldiers who could more fully understand human strategy and thought processes than machines. A small group of worlds, united as the League of Nobles, resist the initial Titan rebellion and remain free from machine rule. With the thinking machines ever-persistent in their intent to enslave or destroy all humans, the League initiates the Butlerian Jihad, mankind's century-long crusade against the machines. The humans are ultimately victorious, destroying all but one hidden copy of Omnius as well as the Titans, the neo-cymeks and all thinking machine forces. With all thinking machine technology henceforth banned, new organizations arise, composed of humans who had developed specialized skills during the Jihad to replace and exceed technology, including the Spacing Guild, Mentats, and the Bene Gesserit. =Great Schools of Dune= In Mentats of Dune (2014), a group of new cymeks are created by the human Dr. Ptolemy using the brains of failed Guild Navigators. Funded by Josef Venport as a counter to Manford Torondo and his fanatical mobs of anti-technology Butlerians, these cymeks are more advanced than their predecessors; a team of them manages to destroy a sandworm on Arrakis, though they are destroyed themselves. Ptolemy himself later willingly undergoes the surgery to have his brain placed in a cymek. Ghola A ghola is a fictional creature in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. Similar to clones, they are \\"manufactured\\" human duplicates grown in an axlotl tank from cells collected from a deceased subject. A true ghola is initially shown to be the resurrection of a corpse through regrowth of damaged tissues, while later gholas in the series are more accurately described as clones‚Äîgrown from genetic material extracted from a few cells (e.g. a small scraping of skin taken moments before death). Through specific stresses, gholas can be made to recall the memories of the original, including their moment of death. In Herbert's Dune series, the technological process is developed and initially monopolized by the Tleilaxu; in later novels the process is also used by the Bene Gesserit. The first ghola featured in the series‚ÄîHayt in 1969's Dune Messiah‚Äîis a resurrection of the corpse of Duncan Idaho. Later gholas are grown from a few cells, as in the case of subsequent Idaho gholas provided to Leto II, as described in God Emperor of Dune (1981). The Tleilaxu can control their creations by forcing them into a hypnotic state with some predefined sound (often a specific humming or whistling noise) that has been pre- conditioned into each ghola. Csilla Csori analyzes the concept of recording and restoring memories in the essay \\"Memory (and the Tleilaxu) Makes the Man\\" in The Science of Dune (2008). =The original series= Before the events of Dune: Messiah, gholas are merely physical copies without the memories of their original incarnations. The ghola Hayt is programmed by the Tleilaxu to kill Emperor Paul Atreides under post-hypnotic suggestion. The attempt fails but, as hoped by the Tleilaxu, the stress of attempting to kill someone who was deeply loved in the ghola's previous life breaks the mental barrier between the ghola's consciousness and the life memories of the original. Hayt recovers the full memories of the original Duncan Idaho. The Tleilaxu are now able to offer Paul a similar ghola \\"resurrection\\" of his deceased beloved Chani to gain leverage over him, but he refuses. In God Emperor of Dune, over Leto II's 3,500-year reign he has, as constant companions, a series of Duncan gholas with restored memories of the original Idaho but not the memories of the previous gholas. They are perfectly reconstructed incarnations made from a few cells, created as needed in the time span of one to two years. In this novel, one of the Duncans recalls how, as a blank ghola, he was tasked to kill a Face Dancer duplicate of Leto's father and Duncan's friend, Paul, and the psychological stress awakened his memories. Fifteen hundred years later in Heretics of Dune (1984), Leto is dead and the Bene Gesserit are the consumers of Duncan gholas. The current Idaho ghola recovers the memories of the original like his predecessors; however, the later attempt by the Honored Matre Murbella to sexually imprint him results in his recovery of the memories of all his ghola incarnations. It is later determined that the Tleilaxu had mixed the cells from multiple Idaho gholas to make this one‚Äîhowever recovery of genetic material from every incarnation would have been impossible for the Tleilaxu, indicating the development of some form of prescient or metaphysical awareness. Though intense psychological trauma is the key to unlocking the memories of a ghola, the actual situation contrived to accomplish this is specific to each individual. When military genius Miles Teg is killed in Heretics of Dune, a ghola of him is born in Chapterhouse: Dune (1985) on orders from Teg's own daughter, Bene Gesserit leader Darwi Odrade.Though the replacement Teg is called a ghola, Herbert notes that he is technically a clone because the cells used to create him had been taken from the original just prior to his death, rather than from a corpse. His former memories are unlocked using sexual imprinting. The discovery of how to reawaken a ghola has tremendous consequences for the Tleilaxu Masters themselves; they subsequently use the technology of axlotl tanks and memory recovery to grant themselves effective immortality. Every Master is \\"recreated\\" upon his death with recovered memories, accumulating many generations of knowledge and experience and permitting planning on a timespan of millennia. =Dune games= There are also mentions of gholas in the Dune games. In Dune 2000 (1998), the Harkonnen Mentat is allegedly a ghola cloned from Tleilaxu flesh vats, and in Emperor: Battle for Dune (2001), House Ordos constantly deploy their own gholas in assassination and infiltration missions. This is particularly effective in tricking the Sardaukar and Fremen into allying with House Ordos. On a much larger scale, they plan to use a ghola of the now-deceased Corrino Emperor to claim the Golden Lion Throne, with the Executrix as the true leaders behind the so-called \\"puppet Emperor\\". Heighliner Spacing Guild heighliner from the Dune miniseries (2000) A heighliner is a type of fictional starship used for interstellar travel in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. These enormous spaceships are the \\"major cargo carrier of the Spacing Guild's transportation system\\". Duke Leto Atreides speaks of them in Dune (1965): Heighliner operation requires a Guild Navigator, who uses a limited form of prescience (made possible by their use of the spice melange), to safely guide the ship across space at \\"translight\\" speeds. Navigators are confined to giant tanks, completely immersed in highly concentrated orange spice gas. Unable to land, heighliners jump from point to point, parking in planetary orbits, though the ship itself does not technically move. Special laws govern travel aboard a heighliner; heighliners are considered neutral territory and all acts of war aboard heighliners carry stiff penalties, including loss of shipping privileges. According to the Legends of Dune prequel trilogy (2002‚Äì2004), heighliners are invented by Norma Cenva during the Butlerian Jihad. The Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy (1999‚Äì2001) establishes that in subsequent millennia, the ships are manufactured on the planet Ix. During the events described in the 2001 prequel Dune: House Corrino, a heighliner is expertly spacefolded into a cavern under the surface of Ix, incapacitating an occupying army during the Atreides-led liberation of the planet. In the novel, heighliners are noted to be more than 20 kilometers long. Holtzman effect The Holtzman effect is a fictional scientific phenomenon in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert, beginning with the 1965 novel Dune. The effect is never explained in detail, but it makes (among other things) defensive force shields and instantaneous space travel possible through its application in Holtzman shields, foldspace or Holtzman drives, suspensors, and glowglobes. Herbert defined the Holtzman effect as \\"the negative repelling effect of a shield generator.\\" Its discovery is explored in the Legends of Dune prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson (2002‚Äì2004). =Holtzman shield= In Dune, the Holtzman effect has been adapted to produce personal defensive shields which permit penetration only by objects that move below a pre-set velocity. Paul Atreides notes in Dune, \\"In shield fighting, one moves fast on defense, slow on attack ... The shield turns the fast blow, admits the slow kindjal!\\" The interaction of a lasgun beam and a Holtzman field results in subatomic fusion and a nuclear explosion. The magnitude of this blast is unpredictable; sometimes it destroys only the shielded target and gunner, sometimes the explosion is more powerful than atomics. Using lasguns in a shielded environment can result in military and environmental catastrophe, though at one point in Dune Duncan Idaho deliberately allows shield/lasgun contact as a discouragement to his enemies. By the time of God Emperor of Dune (1981), the God Emperor Leto II has banned shields throughout his empire \\"to avoid such explosive interactions.\\" The vibrations of an active shield will drive a sandworm on Arrakis into a killing frenzy, drawing them from across territorial lines to attack the shield. For this reason, the native Fremen eschew them. It is noted in Children of Dune (1976) that the Fremen have developed a small shield generator known as a \\"pseudo-shield\\" to attract and madden a worm, for use as an ersatz bomb. =Holtzman drive= The effect is used in this case to fold space at the quantum level, allowing the Spacing Guild's heighliner ships to instantaneously travel far distances across space without actually moving at all. However, the chaotic and seemingly non- deterministic quantum nature of \\"foldspace\\" requires at least limited prescience on the part of the human navigator; otherwise the absurdly complex mathematics involved in producing reliable physical projections of such events would only be possible with advanced computers, which are strictly prohibited because of mankind's crusade against thinking machines, the Butlerian Jihad. To this effect, the Guild produces melange-saturated Navigators who intuitively \\"see paths through foldspace\\" in this way. This stumbling block is overcome several thousand years after the events of Dune when Ixian scientists develop mechanical replacements for Guild Navigators. Kevin R. Grazier analyzes the concepts of folding space and faster-than-light travel in the essay \\"Cosmic Origami\\" in The Science of Dune (2008). =Suspensors= Hovering devices called suspensors utilize the \\"secondary (low-drain) phase of a Holtzman field generator\\" to nullify gravity \\"within certain limits prescribed by relative mass and energy consumption.\\" Suspensors are used in chairs, tables, and structures that are too massive to be physically sound, among other uses. In Dune, the grotesquely obese Baron Vladimir Harkonnen utilizes suspensor belts and harnesses to buoy his flesh and allow him to walk. In Dune, Jessica theorizes that suspensors, like shields, attract sandworms. Kevin R. Grazier analyzes the concept of anti-gravity technology in the essay \\"Suspensor of Disbelief\\" in The Science of Dune (2008). =Glowglobes= A varied use of the Holtzman effect is the glowglobe. This device is a small glowing sphere that floats gracefully above a surface like a portable, personal sun, and is typically tuned to a yellowish color. Herbert describes it as a \\"suspensor-buoyed illuminating device, self-powered (usually by organic batteries).\\" Ixian Probe An Ixian Probe is a fictional device in Frank Herbert's Dune universe used to capture the thoughts of a person (living or dead) for analysis. Ixian Probes are mentioned in Herbert's Heretics of Dune (1984). As described in Heretics of Dune, the probe is an interrogation device of Ixian manufacture which \\"can raid the mind even of a dead person\\". However, the substance shere blocks the effects of the probe, and will protect a person who has taken it even in death. The probe itself or how it works are not described, but when Miles Teg sees a T-Probe for the first time, he believes it is an Ixian Probe. The T-Probe consists of a hood with a series of electrodes attached to the skull, controlled by an operator; the notable difference is that shere has no effect against a T-Probe. Lasgun A lasgun (pronounced ) is a fictional directed-energy weapon, specifically a laser gun, in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. In Terminology of the Imperium, the glossary of the 1965 novel Dune, Herbert provides the following definition: The interaction of a lasgun beam and a Holtzman field results in subatomic fusion and a nuclear explosion. The magnitude of this blast is unpredictable; sometimes it destroys only the shielded target and gunner, sometimes the explosion is more powerful than atomics. Using lasguns in a shielded environment can result in military and environmental catastrophe, though at one point in Dune Duncan Idaho deliberately allows shield-lasgun contact as a discouragement to his enemies. In God Emperor of Dune (1981), lasgun fire is described as \\"blue arcs\\"; a lasgun is noted to be \\"heavy\\" in Chapterhouse: Dune (1985). A cutteray is described in Dune as a \\"Short-range version of a lasgun used mostly as a cutting tool and surgeon's scalpel\\". No-chamber/No-ship A no-ship, from the cover of Chapterhouse: Dune (1985) A no-chamber is a fictional stealth technology in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. Originally called a no-room in Herbert's God Emperor of Dune (1981), it is a construct that hides anything inside from prescient vision, as well as more conventional means of detection, including sight. The mechanism by which no works is unclear in method but explained in function: it takes its contents outside of space-time, preventing them from interaction with the \\"normal\\" universe and even its timeline. There is no entropy and therefore no aging inside a no-chamber. A no-globe is a larger construction of no-chambers, and a no-ship is a no- chamber in starship form, with enough limited prescience to be capable of interstellar travel without the use of a Guild Navigator. =The original series= In God Emperor of Dune, Leto II deduces that the new Ixian Ambassador Hwi Noree had been \\"born\\" in what would come to be known as a no- room to shield her creation and upbringing from him. Hwi had been created by the Ixians from the cells of Leto's friend/nemesis Malky but as Malky's direct opposite‚Äìusing Tleilaxu ghola technology‚Äìdesigned to be irresistible to Leto. The no-room is an improvement upon a device the Ixians had previously created for Leto to record his thoughts into a written journal and hide them from prescient vision. In Heretics of Dune (1984), Miles Teg, the Bene Gesserit Lucilla and the Duncan Idaho ghola hide in a no-globe on Gammu, created by the Harkonnens millennia before when the planet had been called Giedi Prime. It is a sizeable complex, noted to be \\"very ancient but the chambers are still intact and functioning\\". The exact era of its creation is not specified, but it is written that \\"Gammu was Giedi Prime, a Harkonnen place ... They were rich ... Rich enough to accomplish the secret installation of a no-room ... even of a large no-globe ... Bribes, third-party purchases, many transshipments ... The Famine Times were very disruptive and before that there were all those millennia of the Tyrant ... When the Harkonnens kept their heads down or lost them.\\" No-ships are in use at the time of Heretics of Dune; like no-chambers, anything inside a no-ship is hidden from prescient vision and other means of detection, and the ship itself is invisible to sight or photography. However, a no-ship has much greater technological capability than a no-chamber, as it can perform the functions of a Guild Navigator. Specifically, a no-ship's navigation machine is capable of enough limited prescience to successfully navigate its way through foldspace. Teg steals a massive no-ship from the fierce Honored Matres on Gammu in Heretics of Dune, and its Great Hold alone is noted to be one kilometer in length, large enough to transport an adult sandworm. In Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), the Bene Gesserit initially confine Duncan and Murbella to this no-ship on Chapterhouse for their own protection from prescient spying. As Murbella becomes the leader of a New Sisterhood composed of both the Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres, Duncan and Teg flee Chapterhouse with Sheeana and other passengers on the no- ship. In Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse Dune it is suggested that certain characters of Atreides ancestry have the ability to use their prescient powers to \\"see\\" no-ships. This ability to nullify no-field invisibility is unleashed in Miles Teg after he is interrogated with a device called a T-Probe. Teg's subsequent ghola duplicate also retains that unique ability after his memories are re-awakened. =Sequels= In Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007), the novels by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson which complete Frank Herbert's original series, the fleeing no-ship is named the Ithaca by its passengers in homage to the long journey of the mythological Greek hero Odysseus to his home of Ithaca. Accompanying Duncan, Teg and Sheeana are some 150 refugees, including the (apparent) last Tleilaxu Master Scytale, some Bene Gesserit Sisters, and a group of secret Jews. They seek a new world onto which to introduce the captive sandworms on board, as well as a new home for the Jews, but are in constant pursuit by the Unknown Enemy who seek to ensnare the ship in an inescapable tachyon net. With the help of genetic material possessed by Scytale, the passengers of the Ithaca begin growing gholas of historical heroes such as Paul Atreides and Lady Jessica to assist them in the final battle they know is coming against the Unknown Enemy. =Prelude to Dune= In the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy (1999‚Äì2001) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, the creation of the Harkonnen no-globe is attributed to a man named Chobyn. He invents the technology and builds the no-globe for Baron Vladimir Harkonnen immediately prior to the events of Dune (1965). However, Chobyn is killed and the technology lost until it is reinvented by the Ixians millennia later during the reign of Leto II. Ornithopter Paul Atreides's ornithopter, from Frank Herbert's 1985 work of short fiction \\"The Road to Dune\\" An ornithopter (from Greek roots ornithos- \\"bird\\" and pteron \\"wing\\" ) is an aircraft that flies by flapping its wings. In the Dune universe, ornithopters (or thopters) are one of the primary modes of transportation on Arrakis. Herbert describes ornithopters as \\"Aircraft capable of sustained wing-beat flight in the manner of birds\\" in his 1965 novel Dune. The craft achieve takeoff primarily though the beat of their wings, with jet power assisting in propulsion and stabilization: The wings themselves, consisting of \\"delicate metal interleavings\\", are adjustable in length through a \\"retractor bar\\" or manually. They are fully extended when the jetpods are used little or not at all: The wings are shortened when more jet thrust is used or the 'thopter uses the \\"jet-boost\\" alternative mode of takeoff, and tip to assist in braking. In the 1984 film adaptation Dune, ornithopters are depicted with small, folding, non-flapping wings. Propulsion is provided via an antigravity device called an \\"etherbender\\" by the film's designers but this is never mentioned in the film itself. The device itself, however, is visible on the undersurface of the ornithopter. In the 2000 Sci Fi Channel miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune, the craft have wings that appear to incorporate tiltrotor technology. Stillsuit Fremen wearing stillsuits, from Dune (1984) A stillsuit is a fictional body suit in Frank Herbert's Dune universe, first introduced in the 1965 novel Dune and appearing in every subsequent novel in the series. Stillsuits of varying types are worn by the native Fremen of the desert planet Arrakis to maintain their body moisture in the harsh environment. The Science of Dune (2008) analyzes Herbert's stillsuit and its feasibility in the real world as described. =Description= As described in Dune, a stillsuit is a \\"body-enclosing garment\\" of Fremen design which performs the \\"functions of heat dissipation and filtering bodily wastes\\" to reclaim moisture. Pumps actuated by movement of the chest (breathing), and others actuated in the heel, move the water through the filtration process and provide the necessary heat exchange. As the planetologist Liet-Kynes is assisting Duke Leto Atreides with the fitting of his stillsuit, he explains it in this manner: =Analysis= In his essay \\"Stillsuit\\" in The Science of Dune, John C. Smith suggests that \\"Stillsuits designed using strict literal interpretations from the Dune books probably would not work and most likely would cook the wearer like a Crock-Pot ... However, engineering solutions can be envisioned for all the suit's shortcomings.\\" T-Probe A T-Probe is a fictional device in Frank Herbert's Dune universe used to capture the thoughts of a person (living or dead) for analysis. T-Probes appear or are referenced in Herbert's Heretics of Dune (1984) and Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), as well as the sequels Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. As described in Heretics of Dune, the probe is a non-Ixian interrogation device brought by the Honored Matres from The Scattering. It is attached to the body through a series of \\"medusa contacts\\" placed around the skull and on major nerve centers. An operator can increase or decrease the power supplied to the probe to maximize its efficacy while at the same time not overloading the nervous system of the subject. While being subjected to the probe, Miles Teg's Mentat thinking deduces that not only can it \\"command his body as though he had no thinking part in his own behavior\\", but also \\"The whole spectrum of his senses could be copied into this T-probe and identified ... The machine could trace those out as though it made a duplicate of him.\\" The probe builds a 'digital framework' of the person which can be subjected to stimuli, and will respond as the person would. The T-Probe also causes massive, virtually unendurable pain in a living subject. Shere only prevents the T-Probe from recovering memories directly (as it does for the Ixian Probe) and does not impede any of the other features. Memories can still be guessed at from the model the probe constructs. The T-Probe is what causes Miles Teg's brain to change its structure, giving him the blinding speed and amazing abilities seen at the end of Heretics of Dune. This mental alteration continues in Teg even after being 'reborn' as a Tleilaxu ghola in Chapterhouse Dune. Weirding Module Paul Atreides (Kyle MacLachlan) wielding a Weirding Module in Dune (1984) A Weirding Module is a sonic weapon introduced in and specific to Dune, the 1984 David Lynch film adaptation of Frank Herbert's 1965 novel of the same name. In the film, the device is a sonic beam weapon that translates specific sounds into attacks of varying potency, used by House Atreides and later by the Fremen armies. In the novel, Paul Atreides and his mother Lady Jessica teach the Fremen the Bene Gesserit martial arts called the \\"weirding way\\" by the Fremen; an indirect reference to this detail is made in the scene where Jessica physically overpowers Fremen leader Stilgar at their first encounter. Director David Lynch is said to have adapted the weirding way into the Weirding Module because he did not like the idea of \\"kung-fu on sand dunes\\". The change literalizes Paul's line \\"My own name is a killing word\\". In the novel, the Fremen shout his Fremen name, \\"Muad'Dib\\", as a battle cry; in the film, the Fremen are surprised to find that saying \\"Muad'Dib\\" is a powerful trigger for the Weirding Module. The Weirding Module appears in the computer games Dune (1992) and Emperor: Battle for Dune (2001), and the concept is adapted into \\"sonic tanks\\" for the games Dune II (1992) and Dune 2000 (1998). There is no reference to this technology in the original novels. Other technologies Herbert's series of Dune novels have numerous other technologically advanced devices. In Dune (1965), water is scarce on the desert planet Arrakis; the native Fremen use a type of air well called a windtrap to condense moisture from the air and collect it in vast catch basins. They also collect moisture from the dead using a device called a deathstill. The Fremen accomplish long-distance coded communication using a distrans, a steganographic device that produces a \\"temporary neural imprint\\" on the nervous system of bats or birds. The message imprint is carried within the animal's normal cry, and can later be separated out using another distrans. A palm lock is a lock or seal keyed to a specific human hand, a solido is a projected three-dimensional image, and a poison snooper is a device which can detect poisons by analyzing radiation in the \\"olfactory spectrum\\". In Dune, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen employs a cone of silence, a sound-deadening field used for privacy, though it does not visually obscure lip movement. In Heretics of Dune (1984) Herbert mentions an Ixian damper, a similar, portable device described as a \\"black disc\\" which is buoyed midair by suspensors; it hides words from anyone without the proper coded translator, and projects distortions that hide the precise movements of lips and the sounds of voices. A filmbook is a shigawire imprint, used for training and education, which carries a mnemonic pulse that imprints information and corresponding images in the reader's mind. Herbert mentions other unnamed technologies in the Dune series. In Dune, the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Mohiam \\"tests\\" young Paul Atreides using a box that inflicts pain through \\"nerve induction\\". It is described as \\"a green metal cube about fifteen centimeters on a side\\", with one open side revealing a blackness so dark that no light penetrates it. Paul is forced to place his hand into the box and not remove it until Mohiam allows him. He experiences first coldness, tingling, then itching, followed by \\"the faintest burning\\" which soon intensifies to the point that \\"he could feel skin curling black on that agonized hand, the flesh crisping and dropping away until only charred bones remained\\". The pain stops, and when he is permitted to remove his hand, it is unmarked and unharmed. This device is later referred to as the \\"agony box\\" in Heretics of Dune, and is noted to be used for interrogation as well. Carol Hart analyzes the concept of inflicting pain without injury in the essay \\"The Black Hole of Pain\\" in The Science of Dune (2008). In God Emperor of Dune (1981), Moneo Atreides uses a memocorder, a tiny handheld device described as \\"a dull black Ixian artifact whose existence crowded the proscriptions of the Butlerian Jihad\\". In the same novel, the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Anteac writes a message to be sent to her Sisterhood: In Heretics of Dune, Reverend Mother Lucilla recognizes a device called a hypnobong in use on the street, witnessing a passerby lean into a concave basin and then lift his face \\"with a shudder ... staggering slightly, his eyes glazed\\".

This connection, while previously thought to be permanent, has been found to be brief and very dynamic. The European Space Agency's four Cluster spacecraft and NASA's five THEMIS probes have flown through and surrounded these FTEs, measuring their dimensions and identifying the particles that are transferred between the magnetic fields. Formation Earth's magnetosphere and the Sun's magnetic field are constantly pressed against one another on the dayside of Earth. Approximately every eight minutes, these fields briefly merge, forming a temporary \\"portal\\" between the Earth and the Sun through which high-energy particles such as solar wind can flow. The portal takes the shape of a magnetic cylinder about the width of Earth. Current observations place the portal at up to 4 times the size of Earth. Simulations Since Cluster and THEMIS have directly sampled FTEs, scientists can simulate FTEs on computers to predict how they might behave. Jimmy Raeder of the University of New Hampshire told his colleagues simulations show that the cylindrical portals tend to form above Earth's equator and then roll over Earth's winter pole. In December, FTEs roll over the north pole; in July they roll over the south pole.  Flux transfer events beyond Earth  Magnetic fields similar to Earth's are common throughout known space and many undergo similar flux transfer events. During its second flyby of the planet on October 6, 2008, the NASA probe MESSENGER discovered that Mercury‚Äôs magnetic field shows a magnetic reconnection rate ten times higher than Earth's. Mercury's proximity to the Sun only accounts for about a third of the reconnection rate observed by MESSENGER and the cause of this discrepancy is not currently known. Most recently, it has been found that the same phenomenon, also known as a 'magnetic rope', can be observed at Saturn. The findings prove that at times Saturn \\"behaves and interacts with the Sun in much the same way as Earth\\".

It was originally built as a district ranger station for the Clackamas Lake Ranger District. It was later converted to a summer guard station. Today, the Forest Service rents the historic ranger's residence to recreational visitors. The Clackamas Lake Ranger Station is listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  In the 1920s and 1930s, forest road networks were not well developed. To facilitate work in National Forests, the Forest Service built district ranger stations at strategic locations within the forest to house full-time employees and provide logistics support to fire patrols and project crews working at remote forest sites. After World War II, the Forest Service greatly expanded its road network, allowing employees to get to most forest areas within a few hours. As a result, many of the more isolated ranger stations were closed or converted to summer guard station.\\"A bit of History\\", Recreation Rentals of the Pacific Northwest, Pacific Northwest Region, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Portland, Oregon, 12 August 2008.Jacoby, Jayson, \\"Rustic Forest Service cabins available for rent\\" , Baker City Herald, Baker City, Oregon, 27 April 2006. The Forest Service began using the Clackamas Lake site in 1905. The original ranger cabin and barn were built by the district's first ranger, Joe Graham, in 1906. The compound was expanded during the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps. All of the historic buildings that exist at the site today are from that era. The range station served as the summer administrative site for the Clackamas Lake Ranger District from 1906 until the 1952 when the compound was converted to a guard station for fire crews and work parties. After a short period of disuse in the 1960s, the guard station was reopened in the early 1970s. Since then, the site has remained in continuous use as a guard station, work center, recreation facility, and visitor center.Joslin, Les, Uncle Sam's Cabins, Wilderness Associates, Bend, Oregon, 1995, pp 201-203. Because of the rustic architecture of the buildings and the site's unique historic value as an early Forest Service ranger station, the Clackamas Lake Ranger Station compound was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Place in 1981.\\"Clackamas Lake Ranger Station Historic District\\", National Register of Historic Places, www.nationalregisterofhistoricalplaces.com, 30 October 2008.\\"Clackamas Lake Guard Station\\", Facilities Master Planning Toolbox, Forest Service Engineering, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C., 24 July 2007.

The windows are four-over-four panes in a double-hung sash. The front entrance faces south and has a flagstone porch steps except for the final step, which is cut from a large peeled log. The office interior is divided into two rooms. The office walls are covered by painted wood panels, and the floors are varnished fir. * The ranger's residence was built the in 1933. The residence plan was chosen by District Ranger Francis Williamson out of a group of Weyerhaeuser plans entitled Your Future Home. With the exception of exterior building materials, the residence was constructed to the plan's specifications. It is a -story, wood-frame building with a concrete foundation. It has a wood-shingled exterior and high gable roof. Windows are six-over-six panes in double-hung sashes with slab-wood frames giving the appearance of being notched and joined logs. There is a small front porch that protects the south-facing front entrance. The interior rooms of the ranger's residence have varnished fir-paneling with a large stone fireplace and built- in book cases in the living room.

It is a one-story, wood-frame building with a concrete foundation. The structure is similar in style to the ranger's residence and office with a wood-shake exterior and high gable roof. There is a rustic stone chimney on the east end of the building. The front entrance faces north and is covered by a gable hood-type porch supported by peeled-pole brackets. * The mess hall was built in 1934. It is a one-story, wood-frame structure with two entrances on the north side of the building. The exterior siding, foundation, and gabled roof are the same as the office and ranger residences. * The fire warehouse was built between 1934 and 1935. It is a one-story, wood-frame structure with a concrete foundation covered with a rubble-stone veneer. The first four feet of the exterior walls were constructed with slab-wood. Above that level the exterior is covered with wooden shakes. The main entry is at the center of the north side of the building with a flagstone porch platform in front of a large wooden door. * The road and trails warehouse was built in 1934. It is a simple one-story, wood-frame building with double entrance doors and large sliding doors on the north side * The gas and oil storage building was built at the same time as the fire warehouse, and its design details match the warehouse. It is one- story, wood-frame structure. On the north side, the gable roof projects out over the gas pumps and vehicle service area. The main entrance is on the north side. There is also a loading dock on the east end of the building. * A one- story, wood-frame garage next to the ranger's residence was built in 1933. It has a concrete foundation with rubble-stone veneer and high gable roof. The exterior walls are slab-wood on the lower level with wooden shakes above, similar to the fire warehouse exterior. The garage has large double doors on the north side, and accommodates one vehicle. * The ranger station's blacksmith shop was built in 1934. It is a one-story, wood-frame structure. On three sides of the shop, the exterior has horizontal slab-wood boards on the lower level with wooden shakes covering the upper walls. On the south side the lower level is covered by horizontal wooden panels with wooden shakes above. The shop has double sliding doors in the centered of the north side and a normal entrance door on the south side. * The ranger station's horse barn was probably built in 1935. The barn is a -story, wood-frame, structure. It has a high gable roof with wooden shingles and a wood-frame cupola on top. The exterior walls are covered by wood shingles. * The pump house was built about the same time as the barn. Both building are located across the meadow from the other historic buildings. The pump house is small one-story, wood-frame building with a wood-shingle exterior and high gable roof. There is also a Forest Service campground next to the historic Clackamas Lake Ranger Station. The campground has 46 camp sites, potable drinking water, and several modern restrooms.\\"Campgrounds\\", Mount Hood National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Sandy, Oregon, 16 September 2008, The ranger station and campground are only a short distance to Clackamas Lake, and just three miles (5 km) from the much larger and very popular Timothy Lake.

J. (1997). \\"International dimensions of organizational behavior\\". Cincinnati, Ohio: South-Western College Pub. of McGill University which describes an attempt to bring two or more cultures together to form an organization or environment that is based on combined strengths, concepts and skills. The differences in the world's people are used in such a way that encourages mutual growth by cooperation.Managing Cultural Differences By Robert T. Moran, Philip R. Harris, Sarah V. Moran In a more general sense, cultural synergy can be observed in the creation new or reproduced cultural forms that are distinct from the cultures from which those forms are derived.Faulconbridge, J.R. and Beaverstock, J.V. (2009). \\"Globalization: Interconnected worlds\\". In Clifford, N.J., Holloway, S.L., Rice, S.P., and Valentine, G. (eds.). Key Concepts in Geography. 2nd ed. Los Angeles: Sage. In either case, cultural synergy may be expected to be more prevalent as globalization takes place., and the concept and/or phrase can be found in discussions of globalization.Hannerz, U. (1996). Transnational Connections. London: Routledge.  Cultural Assimilation  The concept goes back in the 1970s in the USA , at a time when the American management was thought to be the one and only business model. This is what is commonly known as the concept of Ethnocentrism , which some specialist consider to be cause of the general ignorance amongst American managers towards the influence of culture on management. It was only a matter of time (after the postwar economic success of other foreign countries) until American management realised that Ethnocentrism cand have negative consequences and started to incorporate different approaches for their management. Moreover, the flow of immigrants coming to work in the USA contributed to the change of conducting management, as the managers started to consider Cultural Pluralism , a completely different view from what they were used to have, known as the \\"melting-pot\\", which was based on forcing the immigrant workforce to adapt to the American culture.Adler, N.J (1980). \\"Cultural Synergy : The Management of Cross-Cultural Organizations\\" Published in W.Warner Burke and Leonard D.Goodstein (eds.), \\"Trends and Issues in OD : Current Theory and Practice\\". San Diego, California : University Associates, 1980: pp. 163-184  Definition of Synergy  The word comes from ancient Greek: synergia means working together. Andrew Campbell and Michael Goold, two British academics, define it as ‚Äúlinks between business units that result in additional value creation‚Äù. It is, they go on to say, ‚Äúa Holy Grail for large multi-unit companies‚Äù. It is something akin to the philosopher's stone: seeming to create extra value without consuming resources. Synergy means cooperation that occurs between diverse groups of people with different viewpoints that work together. The aim of synergy is to increase effectiveness by combining various knowledge, perceptions and viewpoints together. It is a common belief that ‚Äúwhen solving problems, groups are often smarter than the smartest people within them‚Äù.Surowiecki, 2004, p. G1 Synergy is extremely important in business, as it gathers resources needed for successful operations and it complies with our present society where diversity is considered to be a value.  Organizational Change  Organizational Change has a very broad meaning and it can be major or minor, depending on the number or individuals from a specific organization it affects. From changing the water supplier to completely transforming the marketing strategy, every change is important and has consequences. On one hand, cultural synergy can be understood as a major organizational change, as it merges cultures and customs within a company and presumably finalises with a change of the better, creating a more solid company culture, bonding the employees. On the other hand, the phenomenon has not been sufficiently studied and researched, and it is also known that it can be chaotic for the employees, as they are being put through unfamiliar circumstances.  High Synergy Organizations vs. Low Synergy Organizations  High Synergy Organizations have employees that cooperate for mutual advantage and usually tackle their problems by following a very simple structure that focuses on identifying the problem, culturally interpreting it and finally, increasing the cultural activity. Contrary to this, there are Low Synergy Organizations that work with employees that are ruggedly individualistic and insist on solving any problem alone.  Synergy and Cross-Cultural Communication Competence  Individuals from multinational organizations who follow the cultural synergy concept in today‚Äôs global economy must be aware and competent in cross-cultural communication. Previous research indicates that the effectiveness of global corporations is highly influenced by the cross-cultural competence.Cox, Lobel, & McLeod, 1991 \\"Effects of ethnic group cultural differences on cooperative and competitive nehaviour on a group task\\" Academy of Management Journal Vol.34 No.4 . 827-847Mateev & Nelson, International Journal of Cross Cultural Management August 2004 vol. 4 no. 2 253-270Townsend, Anthony, DeMarie, Samuel & Hendrickson, Anthony 1996.

The present postmodern society is transitioning towards a high-synergy era where the win-win and the all triumph concepts are adopted. The key-points of this system are the mutual advantage and the strong connection that people are building with each other. Commonwealth has become the main focus of social institutions which promote individual and group development. In order to give in into this postmodern era, acceptance of the high-synergy society which leads to way to better international business practices is required. ‚ÄúSynergy takes on increasing importance as multinational organizations, non-profit agencies, and governmental activities become more global in scope, more complex in practice, and more sophisticated in technology.‚Äù  Examples of organizations and companies that follow the Cultural Synergy concept  * Shell * Microsoft * Autolive * The University of Melbourne * Deutsche Bank * Disney Parks and Resorts * BP * Cadbury Schweppes * AmBank Group * Sara Lee * Telstra * Baker Hughes Inteq  Further reading  * Eisenhardt, K.M. and Galunic, D.C., ‚ÄúCo- Evolving: At Last a Way to Make Synergies Work‚Äù, Harvard Business Review, January‚ÄìFebruary 2000 * Goold, M. and Campbell, A., ‚ÄúDesperately Seeking Synergy‚Äù, Harvard Business Review, September‚ÄìOctober 1998 * Hagel, J.

As it is state-maintained, unlike most business routes in California, it is assigned route numbers - part of U.S. Route 50 on its western half (5.64 miles/9.08 km), and unsigned State Route 51 on its eastern half (8.86 miles/14.26 km). The full road is a freeway, and carried Interstate 80 until 1981, when the signage and designation of Interstate 80 was transferred to the Beltline Freeway, previously signed as Interstate 880. At that time, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) assigned the Interstate 305 designation to the west half, which met Interstate Highway standards. However, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has never signed this number, put it on any road signs, or used it internally.

Inalchuq was an uncle of Sultan Muhammad II of Khwarezmia. His name meant \\"little Inal\\" in his native Turkic, and he held the title Ghayir-Khan. History =Slaughter of Mongolian trade caravan= In 1218, a Mongolian trade caravan of around 450 men arrived in Otrar, including an ambassador of Genghis Khan. Inalchuq accused them of being Mongolian spies and arrested them. There may, in fact, have been spies in the caravan; however Inalchuq may have also been provoked by having been called Inalchuq rather than the less familiar Ghayir- Khan by one of the members of the caravan, or perhaps was motivated by simply wanting to seize the caravan's riches. With the assent of Sultan Muhammad, he executed the entire caravan, and its goods were sold in Bukhara. A camel driver escaped this massacre to report back to Genghis Khan, who responded by sending a delegation of one Muslim and two Mongol diplomats to Sultan Muhammad demanding Inalchuq be punished. Muhammad responded by beheading the Muslim ambassador and shaving off the beards of his two Mongol companions, provoking Genghis Khan's retaliatory invasion. Genghis Khan besieged Otrar in 1219, as one of the first major cities to be attacked. Inalchuq was in charge of the garrison (an exaggerated 20,000-60,000 men according to pro-Mongol historians).Carl Sverdrup, \\"The Mongols Conquests: The Military Operations of Genghis Khan and Sube'etei,\\" p. 148.

Unlike most of the other cities, which either felt no loyalty to the Shah and surrendered with little to no fighting or sallied out with outnumbered forces to be destroyed by the Mongols in the field; Otrar's garrison remained on their walls and resisted stubbornly against Mongol attacks for over five months. The city only fell when a traitor within the walls (a sub-commander named Qaracha) opened the gates to the besiegers and defected with part of his army; he and his men were slaughtered by the Mongols regardless, who said they would not trust traitors to serve them.Ata-Malik Juvayni, \\"History of the World Conqueror,\\" p. 83-84 (John Andrew Boyle's translation) =Capture and Execution= The Mongols entered the city and slaughtered most of Inalchuq's unprepared garrison at night. Following this, Inalchuq barricaded himself in Otrar's inner citadel with the remnants of his troops (reportedly 1/10 of the garrison), managing to hold out for another month and inflict heavy casualties against further Mongol attacks. Eventually, he was trapped with his last two remaining bodyguards on the upper floors of the citadel; the Mongols desired to capture him alive to execute him. Now out of missiles to launch, Inalchuq and his guards resorting to throwing bricks down on the Mongols, reportedly slaying many of them. Finally the governor's guards were killed and he was captured. Inalchuq was reportedly executed by molten silver being poured into his eyes and ears, though this may be apocryphal.

His programme, Here Comes The Night, was first aired on the opening day of Radio Ireland (now Today FM)'s existence, 17 March 1997. He later moved to the Small Hours show, which broadcast between Monday and Thursday in the midnight - 2AM slot. On 30 December 2007, The Small Hours had a two-hour radio special broadcast from the living room of David Gray's London home, where Gray and Liam √ì Maonla√≠ traded songs and stories on the piano and acoustic guitar, \\"intermittently picking their Desert Island discs for Dineen to spin\\". Dineen also had a line-up in the Body & Soul area of Electric Picnic 2008. As a curator, Dineen has worked on several musical series, most significantly A Month of Sundays which was devised with The Model Arts and Niland Gallery Sligo in 2006 and evolved into a touring series in 2007. In November 2009 he curated a mini festival called Fresh Air which profiled \\"his selection of the most exciting and experimental sound makers working today. The aim is to bring to light the sheer diversity and calibre of music being made on these shores, and to bring new music, live or recorded, to air\\". In addition to presenting a show on Today FM, Dineen has also presented programs on TXFM, a regional station that broadcasts to Dublin and the surrounding areas and which is also a sister station to Today FM.

Although milk and dairy products are noted to be an excellent choice for people with low economic status in order to provide them with a cheap form of calcium and numerous forms of nutrients, it doesn't completely rid the epidemic. For people in super low standing, many dairy products especially fresh are not in reach. Additionally, even for families than can afford to include dairy and achieve its health benefits, many cannot afford the high inflated prices that come with having the best versions of dairy such as organic, non-gmo products. The true way to aid in helping this epidemic is to advocate for businesses and large corporations to provide their dairy products for lower prices, increasing its accessibility to more people.

At over 12.5 metres tall, it is recognized as the largest barometer in the world by The International Guinness Book of Records.The Guinness Book of Records 1988, Enfield UK: Guinness Publishing Ltd, p.77. The instrument was created in 1985 in the Netherlands; in 2007 it was reinstalled in the new Visitor Centre of Denmark, Western Australia and was removed from there in 2011. History =The Netherlands= The Dutch writer and barometer specialist Bert Bolle (born 1947) designed and built the water barometer in 1985 as the focal point of the Barometer Museum, which he ran with his wife Ethne in the 18th-century country house ‚ÄòRustenhoven‚Äô at Maartensdijk in central Netherlands. In 1978 Bolle wrote a book titled Barometers, which was translated into German and English. In 1983 he wrote a scientific sequel to his first book and developed some modifications of the mercury barometer system. In 1985 Bolle and his wife set up a barometer museum in their country house. Their aim was to create a collection based on loans of barometers from private collectors and museums in the Netherlands. To obtain these loans, a massive publicity campaign was undertaken.Scientific Instrument Society Bulletin No. 10, 1986, p.22. Bolle wanted something to make the museum's launch spectacular, an appliance that would be impressive and definitive which would serve as the centre point of the Barometer Museum. He decided to design and make a water barometer, paying homage to the 17th-century scientists, such as Evangelista Torricelli and Gasparo Berti, who produced some of the first and most crucial vacuum experiments, and created the first water barometers alongside their houses between 1640 and 1660. Bolle's old three-story country house had ample height, the highest point of which was the roof of the main hall: a leaded glass cupola. The apex of the hall was over 12 metres from the hall floor; a perfect environment for such an enormous instrument. Bolle decided to make a construction of four borosilicate glass (e.g. Pyrex) pipes of 90 mm diameter. He fitted the pipes to a nine-metre-long solid oak plank, which was one metre wide at the base. For the top three metres of the barometer, a 25 mm thick polymethylmethacrylate (e.g. Perspex) sheet was used. The reservoir chamber was also made of borosilicate glass; with a diameter of 600 mm the capacity of this reservoir was enough to hold 150 litres of water, which was necessary to make the barometer work properly. The first successful test runs took place in November and December 1985. Bolle designed the top end of the water barometer to be connected to a rotary vane pump, which was governed by timer relays. At ten-minute intervals, the pump evacuated the air from the glass pipe, causing the 12-metre-tall instrument to fill with 55 litres of water within one minute. Visitors were invited to climb the stairs and follow the water to the top, where it started to boil spontaneously (see below). The huge register plate had two scales: centimeters of water and millibar. Water vapour pressure depresses the reading of water barometers, and the magnitude of this error increases with temperature. Thus, a rule of thumb was provided to make a correction for temperature. After a reading period of five minutes, air was admitted to the top area of the pipe. Within a couple of minutes all the water would return to the cistern downstairs, after which the ten-minute pump cycle would start again. Visitors were able to watch a real living instrument the whole day. The instrument proved to be a massive drawcard and appeared several times in the media during the subsequent twelve-year period during which Bolle's Barometer Museum operated.Scientific Instrument Society Bulletin No. 29, June 1991, p.27. In 1998 the museum was closed down.For a list of sources concerning the barometer in the Netherlands (in Dutch), see the Dutch Wiki- article. =Australia= Bolle and his wife migrated to Australia in 1999, but the maker didn‚Äôt want to part with his creation, so the barometer was brought with them to Australia, where Bolle donated it to the community of Denmark, a small town in Western Australia. The town didn‚Äôt have a building high enough to house the enormous instrument, but in 2004 plans were adopted for a new multi-function Visitors Centre, the centre part of which would be The Barometer Tower, built especially for the instrument. The Shire of Denmark made the water barometer a local monument, named The Bert Bolle Barometer. Furthermore, the shire announced that the tower would be dedicated to the water barometer and the history of weather instruments in general and access would be free of charge.Memorandum of Understanding between the Denmark Shire and Bert Bolle, 16.02.2007. In 2007 the Denmark Visitor Centre was finished.‚ÄúDenmark joins the big league‚Äù, Suellen Jerrard, The West Australian, 11.11.2006 p.64. It was officially opened on 10 August by the Minister for Tourism in Western Australia Mrs Sheila McHale.WIN TV News, 13.08.2007, 18.00WST, Denmark Bulletin, Albany Advertiser, Albany Weekender, 16.08.2007. In the Barometer Tower the Bert Bolle Barometer stood on a stainless steel pedestal. The vacuum pump cycle became shorter than it was in the Netherlands; reduced to six minutes from the previous ten. The timer relays had been replaced by a PLC, which now governs a refined and modernized vacuum system with 11 solenoid valves. Operating eight hours per day, seven days a week, the water barometer was constantly ‚Äòon the move‚Äô. Visitors could walk up the stairs and take a reading in the Reading Room atop the Tower. At the moment when the water reached its highest possible point in the glass pipe, visitors could witness an interesting physical phenomenon for about a minute. The air pressure above the water had lowered dramatically. Therefore, the evaporation of the water happened so vigorously that the water started to boil spontaneously, although its temperature rarely exceeded 20 ¬∞C. This ‚Äòcold boiling‚Äô is contributed to by air bubbles that were formed in the water column. As soon as the pump was disconnected, the evacuating of the pipe stopped and the water level became calm again, enabling people to take a reading. During the time the water level was calm, there was still some turbulence at the surface due to air bubbles rising to the top of the apparatus. Although water vapour pressure depressed the barometers pressure reading, visitors were told how to correct for this error and thus calculate the real air pressure, and could then compare it with the accurate Vaisala digital standard barometer in the Tower. After a reading period of two minutes, air was gradually admitted to the vacuum in the top area of the pipe. Within another two minutes all the water had returned to the reservoir downstairs, after which the six-minute pump cycle of the Bert Bolle Barometer repeated.Description of Barometer operation . Climbing the stairs in the tower, a selection of antique barometers from Europe was displayed, along with five murals depicting the oldest barometer experiments dating from the 17th century. In the Reading Room, tribute was paid to the pioneers of the barometer, the Italian scientists Galileo Galilei and Evangelista Torricelli. On the ground floor, Bolle had created several interesting physical experiments such as the Atmosphere Simulator, in which artificial highs and lows were created. There was also a bell jar showing interesting vacuum experiments with sound and air.‚ÄúThe Big Barometer‚Äù, Australian Broadcasting Corporation South Coast, 14.08.2007.

Special provisions are made to prevent this. Since water vapour is extracted continuously, the water level in the reservoir needs to be topped up every day. In addition, the abundance of sunshine in the barometer's environment, combined with the presence of algae in the rainwater that is employed, leads to a risk of algae growing within the water pipe. To address this, the owners have employed chlorine to kill the algae, but the evaporation of the chlorine had to be specifically catered for. Wear and tear also places considerable strain on the vacuum system's vulnerable pump, its 11 solenoid valves and its relays. Finally, the barometer needs to be exclusively filled with pure rainwater, as tap water contains many minerals which may be detrimental to the barometer.A Handbook for the Water Barometer, The Denmark Visitor Centre, 11.12.2008. Because the water barometer has always been treated with great care, the instrument still looks almost new despite its age. A well-considered choice of durable materials like oak and borosilicate glass certainly play an important role in its continued longevity. Other attempts to copy the instrument have floundered due to the use of inferior material, a lack of constant supervision, pollution of the pipe system and other factors reducing durability.

The fragments that make up this document include 4Q285, also known as The Pierced Messiah Text, and 11Q14 with which it was found to coincide. It is possible that it also represents the conclusion of the War Scroll, as the two read coherently and discuss related thematic issues. pp. 368‚Äì371 The Pierced Messiah text (4Q285) This six-line fragment, commonly referred to as the \\"Pierced Messiah\\" text, is written in a Herodian script of the first half of the 1st Century and refers to the \\"stump of Jesse\\"‚Äîthe Messiah‚Äîfrom the Branch of David, to a judgement, killing, and cleansing of the land of the dead by the Messiah's soldiers. Translation from Hebrew Hebrew is primarily made up of consonants; vowels must be supplied by the reader. The appropriate vowels depend on the context. Thus, the text (line 4) may be translated as \\"and the Prince of the Congregation, the Branch of David, will kill him,\\" or alternately read as \\"and they killed the Prince.\\" Because of the second reading, the text was dubbed the \\"Pierced Messiah.\\" The transcription and translation presented here support the \\"killing Messiah\\" interpretation, alluding to a triumphant Messiah (). Pierced Messiah controversy In September 1992, Time magazine published an article on the War Rule fragment displayed here (object no. 12) exploring the differing interpretations. A \\"piercing messiah\\" reading would support the traditional Jewish view of a triumphant messiah. If, on the other hand, the fragment were interpreted as speaking of a \\"pierced messiah,\\" it would anticipate the New Testament view of the preordained death of the messiah. The scholarly basis for these differing interpretations‚Äîbut not their theological ramifications‚Äîare reviewed in \\"A Pierced or Piercing Messiah?\\" Two different readings There are two possible readings of the war scrolls, with most scholars agreeing on the former as the most logical, as it parallels with the War Scroll and other Dead Sea Scrolls. =Scholarly consensus: English translation= (Serekh ha- Milhamah) 4Q285 (SM) Courtesy of the Israel Antiquities Authority (12) :[...]Isaiah the prophet: [The thickets of the forest] will be cut [ :down with an axe and Lebanon by a majestic one will f]all.

They will enter into judgment with [... :] and they will put to death the Prince of the Congregation, the Bran[ch of David ... :] and with woundings, and the (high) priest will command [ ... :the s]lai[n] of the Kitti[m]\\" Transcription and translation by Eisenman and Wise Terminology 11Q14 describes a Leader of the Congregation, that is, a messianic figure known from other Dead Sea Scrolls. References to Kittim refer to an opposing force, and scholars agree that it most likely refers to the Romans. The stump of Jesse and Branch of David in Frag. 1 Col. 1 refer to the coming of a Messiah from the line of King David.

After the conflict he returned to teaching. Early life and career Claudius Sears was born in the city of Peru located in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. He attended the United States Military Academy in West Point in July 1837, and graduated four years later, standing 31st out of 52 cadets. Despite his Massachusetts birth, Sears would receive his appointment to West Point from the state of New York. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 8th U.S. Infantry on July 1, 1841.Eicher, p. 477. Sears and the 8th Infantry fought in Florida during the Seminole Wars until the fall of 1842. Sears resigned his commission from the U.S. Army on October 10, 1842.

Sears then was a professor at Louisiana University from 1859 into 1860, teaching both math as well as physics. He returned to St. Thomas's Hall in 1860 to serve as its president until 1861. Civil War service At the start of the American Civil War in 1861, Sears chose to follow the Confederate cause and enlisted in the 17th Mississippi Infantry Regiment that May, and elected captain of its Company G soon afterward. Sears and the 17th Infantry fought at the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21 and at the Battle of Ball's Bluff on October 21, and participated during the 1862 Peninsula Campaign engagements of Yorktown, Seven Pines, and the Seven Days Battles. Sears fought at the Battle of Antietam during the Maryland Campaign on September 17. On December 11, 1862, Sears was appointed colonel of the 46th Mississippi Infantry, and began his Western Theater service. With his new regiment, Sears participated during the Vicksburg Campaign of late 1862 and summer of 1863. He fought at Battle of Chickasaw Bayou on December 29, 1862, and the Battle of Port Gibson on May 1, 1863, but during the fighting at the Battle of Champion Hill his regiment was held in reserve.

Sears next participated in the late 1864 Franklin- Nashville Campaign, taking part in the Battle of Allatoona on October 5, the Battle of Franklin on November 30, and the Battle of Nashville on December 15, where Sears was severely wounded. During the fight, a cannonball killed his horse and one of Sears' legs was shot off. He was removed for care to the rear areas of the Army of Tennessee as it retreated, but was left behind and captured on December 27 at Pulaski, Tennessee. Sears was paroled from Nashville, Tennessee on June 23, 1865. Postbellum After the war, Sears returned to Mississippi and taught mathematics & civil engineering at the University of Mississippi from 1865 to 1889.

The building was designed by architects Kirby, Petit & Green in the neo-classical style, and contains almost of space, with offices and residences on the upper floors. The exterior consists of a main facade on Broad Street with two columns, as well as side facades on Beaver and Marketfield Streets with pilasters. The building was erected in 1908 as the home of the American Bank Note Company, a leading engraving company that produced banknotes, currency, stamps, and stock certificates. The company had previously occupied several other sites in Lower Manhattan. After the company sold the building in 1988, it was sold numerous times, and renovated into offices and residences. It is a New York City designated landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History left The American Bank Note Company, a leading engraving company and the building's namesake, produced banknotes, currency, stamps, and stock certificates. It had been formed from a merger of seven firms in 1858. The company's first headquarters and plant were at 55 Wall Street, where in 1862 it created a factory in the penthouse. In 1867, the company moved to 142 Broadway, near the intersection with Liberty Street. It moved again to 78‚Äì86 Trinity Place in 1882. Subsequently, the company began to grow its operations, establishing other factories in Canada and the U.S., as well as expanding its product offerings. In the 1900s, under company president Warren L. Green, the company began looking for a new headquarters. The company purchased the lots at 70‚Äì72 Broad Street in May 1906. The new building at that site, erected to plans by Kirby, Petit, and Green, was completed two years later. The company also bought lots upon which it would construct the American Bank Note Company Printing Plant in the Bronx; Kirby, Petit, and Green also designed this plant, which was built from 1909 to 1911, and served as the company's printing plant until the 1960s. With these two facilities, the company was able to streamline its New York City operations. The American Bank Note Company housed its administrative offices in the building until 1988, when the offices were moved to Blauvelt, New York. The building was then sold to the Bank of Tokyo. See also: It was then bought by Murray and Irvin Reise for $3.5 million. The Reise brothers planned to turn the building into a \\"department store restaurant\\", with four fast-food restaurants at ground level, fast-food seating in the basement, and a larger restaurant occupying the second and third floors, as well as a kitchen on the fourth and fifth floors. The building was sold again in 1995 to Tony Goldman for $1.3 million. Goldman opened a restaurant on the lower floors and moved the offices for his company, Goldman Properties, onto the upper floors. The building was given New York City landmark status in 1997, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places two years later. The American Bank Note Company Building was purchased for $5.5 million in 2004 by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's organization, the Global Country of World Peace (GCWP). The organization supposedly bought the structure because it was \\"one of the very few buildings in all of New York City that's oriented due east\\", and east-facing buildings were considered \\"spiritually healthy\\" under the Maharishi's principles. The building underwent $4.9 million in renovations, and the GCWP used the upper floors as apartments and the lower floors as lecture and meditation rooms. The American Bank Note Company Building was then put up for sale yet again in late 2009; it was originally listed as a mansion for sale at $45 million, though the asking price was then reduced to $25 million. Ultimately, it was sold to an unnamed Chinese construction and investment company in 2010 for $18 million. The structure was then renovated again in 2015 and placed for sale the next year for $88 million in 2016. The building was listed for sale again in 2018 for $43 million.  Design The American Bank Note Company Building is located in the Financial District of Manhattan, two blocks east of Bowling Green. The building occupies a site bounded by Broad Street to the east, Beaver Street to the north, and Marketfield Street to the south. Nearby structures include the Broad Exchange Building to the north and 26 Broadway to the west. The plot measures on Broad Street by on Beaver and Marketfield Streets. Because of the Financial District's street grid, which is derived from the original Castello Plan for New Amsterdam, the site is trapezoid-shaped. The building is a neoclassical five-story structure with nearly of space. It contains office space and luxury apartments on the upper floors. It was designed by architects Kirby, Petit & Green, who based their design on their earlier structure for the Bush Terminal Company at 100 Broad Street. Hedden Construction Company was the general contractor and Charles H. Nichols was the consulting engineer. = Facade = Main facade on Broad Street The facades are divided into three horizontal layers by broad cornices above the first and fourth floors. The single-story base is made of rusticated stone blocks above a raised basement and water table made of smooth ashlar, and a string course runs above it. The second through fourth stories are faced with smooth ashlar, while the fifth floor serves as an attic and is also faced with smooth ashlar. An elaborate entablature runs above the fourth floor, encircled by a metal railing. Another cornice runs above the attic and contains gargoyle medallions at the corners. The Woodbury Granite Company provided the granite for the facade. The main entrance is through a set of glass-and-metal doors in the center of the Broad Street elevation; it is accessed by a small staircase leading from the sidewalk, flanked by short pedestals. Above the doorway, a carved eagle is perched on a cartouche atop two crossed branches. There is a tall, narrow casement window on either side of the entrance stair, as well as a shorter narrow window on the water table. The second through fourth floors on this facade contain two fluted, Corinthian columns, which support a metal-lettered frieze with the American Bank Note Company's name. The columns frame a recessed central bay with casement windows on each level. The side facades on Beaver and Marketfield Streets, to the north and south respectively, each contain five vertical bays. As with the main facade, the first story contains rusticated stone blocks. On the side facades, the three central bays of the first floor each contain large square window openings with aluminum windows. The center bays on the second through fourth floors have aluminum windows in each bay, flanked by large Doric-style pilasters, while the outer bays on each floor consist of flat ashlar masonry with narrow windows and ventilation openings. At the attic, the side facades have openings that are of the same width as the windows on the lower floors. = Interior = The original interior spaces were elaborately furnished. In general, the Shaw Furniture Company designed the furniture; the Black & Boyd Manufacturing Company made the lighting fixtures, and McNulty Bros. made the plaster ceilings. The building also included two elevators. The first floor contained a general office with a large oval mahogany counter, while the walls had wooden wainscoting under an ornate tapestry. There was a bank vault on the west end of the first floor, in the building's rear, while a mezzanine above the first floor had a mahogany handrail and a gilded clock. On the second floor was the president's office, which contained a plaster ceiling with east-west floor beams, as well as green leather furniture. The third floor had a general workroom, with walls painted in a \\"pale terra cotta color\\", as well as red- painted woodwork. On the fourth floor was a board room with blue-and-gold decorations and indigo leather; a private office with mahogany wainscoting, mahogany furniture, and gold chandeliers; and a private dining room with wood wainscoting and a tapestry. There was a kitchen on the fifth floor. The original decoration was subsequently heavily modified. , the upper three floors each contain a full-story residential apartment with two bedrooms, three bathrooms, two living rooms, a dining room, a breakfast room, a kitchen, and a washer-dryer room. A private elevator serves the three suites.

Donnell was born on April 20, 1854, in County Armagh, Ireland, to James Donnell and Elizabeth Doyle. At the age of two, Donnell and his family moved to the United States and settled in Waterford, Pennsylvania. At the age of eighteen, he began his career in the oil industry by hauling crude oil from a refinery in Titusville, Pennsylvania. When the Bradford Oil Field opened in 1874, Donnell went into business for himself, gaining leases at Red Rock and Dallas City, Pennsylvania. He went on to gain further leases in Allentown and Bolivar, New York. He then headed to Ohio to begin work at the Lima Oil Field, and became associated with the Standard Oil Company. In 1889, when the Standard Oil Company gained control of The Ohio Oil Company, Donnell was named a director of the company and manager of its field operations. In 1900 he was elected vice-president and general manager, moving his offices to Findlay, Ohio the following year. In 1906, he accompanied then president of Standard Oil, John D. Archbold to Romania to assist in the reorganization of The Romano-American Oil Company. Two years later, they again set about reorganizing another facet of Standard Oil, with the reorganization of Standard Oil of California in 1908. The Ohio Oil Company In 1911, the United States Supreme Court dismantled Standard Oil on antitrust violations, and The Ohio Oil Company again became an independent company. Donnell succeeded Archbold as its president. He retained the position until his death in 1927. Under his direction, Ohio Oil expanded operations into sixteen states and Mexico. In 1915, he organized the Illinois Pipeline Company to operate pipeline transportation for Ohio Oil. In 1924, Donnell gained control of the Lincoln Oil Refining Company in Robinson, Illinois, giving Ohio Oil its own refining capacity. When he died in 1927, the assets of The Ohio Oil Company totalled $108 million, with $17 million net income. of oil or natural gas producing lands were owned or operated under lease by the company.

Australian blog, Halo-17, gave the record a favorable 8.5/10 rating and said,\\"If you only take a chance on one new rock album this month, make it this one,\\" and \\"The Boxing Lesson cut all the fat from their music, and produced a record which shows that they're a band that should be taken seriously, in addition to providing some of the best music I've heard so far in 2004.\\" Songs in the Key of C In late 2004, Waclawsky relocated from California to Texas, where he assembled a new lineup including Jaylinn Davidson on synthesizers and Jake Mitchell on drums. Practicing and writing songs for a full year before playing live, the band recorded Songs in the Key of C with Tim Gerron at Music Lab in Austin, TX. The sound was a wild departure from the two previous EPs. The Onion's Los Angeles Calendar Section wrote, \\"Gone are the laid-back vocals and gauzy guitars, replaced by passionate singing, frenzied power chords, and tons of gurgling analog synthesizers.\\" The Austin Chronicle gave the release 3 stars and wrote, \\"Though claiming 'Indie Rock Is Dead', the Boxing Lesson's Songs in the Key of C provides enough lo-fi life support in its tales of criminals and crackheads to stay the reaper.\\" Meanwhile, Smother Magazine wrote, \\"The Boxing Lesson are an indie rock band on a mission to the moon.\\" Wild Streaks & Windy Days After doing several tours promoting Songs in the Key of C, the band quickly went back to Tim Gerron in 2007 to record their debut full length album. Focusing on more atmospheric textures and varied styles of songwriting, the 12-song album, Wild Streaks & Windy Days, took 8 months to record and was eventually self-released at SXSW 2008 to positive reviews. Barrett King of Baltimore's S√´n magazine compared the sound of the album to that of other space rock acts like Pink Floyd and David Bowie, while LA Cityzine praised its \\"rich lyrical offerings and strong musicianship\\". The Lemur Blog in Sweden wrote, \\"\\"The result is spaced out, it's probably the best space rock album you can find within the scrutinized confines of 2008.\\". The Music Reviewer gave the album a 9.0/10 and said, \\"It's an amazing mix of the past and the present, without being too much of either. It's a group that you'll hear more of in the future, and it's a group that knows how to pay homage to ‚Äì and not just copy ‚Äì their idols from the past.\\" Indiecision blog from India described The Boxing Lesson's sound as, \\"if Failure and Pink Floyd got together to drink mushroom tea out of fancy little teacups and chase the white rabbit with Brian Eno and Robert Smith\\". Eric Power directed the music video for \\"Dark Side of the Moog\\" from Wild Streaks and Windy Days, featuring an animated version of the band exploring an alien planet. A stop motion music video for the track \\"Brighter\\" was released as well. The video, directed by Victor Yiu, was constructed from over 6000 still images. Additionally, the band released a guerrilla-cam-style video for Dance with Meow shot by Matt Robertson which featured the band dressed in furry cat masks, chasing the White Rabbit, doing cat-nip and visiting local-haunts in Austin's nightlife. Jake Mitchell In August 2008, the band's drummer, Jake Mitchell, was sentenced to five years of prison after being charged by the Austin police for \\"conspiracy to manufacture marijuana\\". Before Mitchell went to prison, the band went into the studio to record a number of tracks that could become the foundation of a new EP. On February 14, 2009, Daytrotter posted a session recorded live in Rock Island, IL, featuring an unreleased song, \\"Room 17,\\" that was written as a tribute to Mitchell. Fur State On October 26, 2010, The Boxing Lesson released Fur State, a lo- fi acoustic/electronic instrumental album recorded on a 4-track by Waclawsky and Davidson in 2004. The album heavily features synthesizers and drum loops and marks a turning point in the evolution of the band. The album name is a play on words for the \\"first eight\\" songs recorded in Austin. Self-released on homemade cassette tapes, the album cover depicts the State of Texas in a tiger fur pattern. Some of these songs are instrumental stripped down versions of songs that appeared on Songs in the Key of C and Wild Streaks & Windy Days. Cassette restoration and Mastering by Danny Reisch at Good Danny's, Austin, TX. An animated music video by Jeanne Hospod was released for the opening track, \\"One\\". It features a ghost-rodeo, space-travel, feminine beauty, psychedelic felines, art and enlightenment from the far reaches of Austin, TX. Hospod released an erotic animated video for the track \\"Four\\" in early 2011. The artist's description was, \\"Alien woman seduces hapless human male involving a very unusual flower.\\" Nathan Guy directed a non-animated cat- themed video for the track \\"Three\\" that was released at SXSW 2011. The director described the video as \\"Morphing cats' psychedelic journey through the Fur State,\\" and video blended live performance shots with warped smoky images showing the band in costume hanging at local Austin haunts. Muerta EP The Boxing Lesson released a collection of four slow-tempo psychedelic tracks entitled Muerta EP in the summer of 2011. These songs were recorded over several years in Austin, TX with several drummers. These four recordings chronicle the band's evolution during this time period and are an expansion of their space rock sound. Vivogig reviewer Jim Sells says, \\"Well, the Boxing Lesson nails it on Muerta.‚Äù Pink Floyd influences the music but there is more to their sound than a Floyd fixation. Elements of M83, the Northern Soul- period of The Verve, and the adventurousness of Ponytail all are present here. The effects-laden guitar weaves in and out of the soaring Moog parts, creating a sonic landscape that draws the listener in from the first sound. Sells goes on to note that \\"Muerta has to be in my Top 10 for the year. There is just nothing like it out there.\\" A double 7inch vinyl set was pressed by New Fortune Records. The \\"Muerta\\" music video directed by Jonathan London and animated by Will Kistler was also released. The CGI enhanced video depicts the band drowning to the depths of the sea. Health is the New Drug b/w Better Daze \\"Health is the New Drug\\" was released as a single along with b-side \\"Better Daze\\" in February 2012. New Fortune Records, a Detroit imprint, pressed a vinyl single. It's the first track being released from the upcoming Big Hits LP produced by Chris \\"Frenchie\\" Smith (Trail of Dead, Meat Puppets, Ume). The song features psychedelic guitar riffs, a wall of synthesizers, and a few words of wisdom (or caution). \\"Relying on MOOG for bottom end and tons of sonic noise, the songs blend Meddle-era Floyd guitar freak-outs with M83 propulsion, Spiritualized soul space jams with Texas rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll thunder.\\" High praise came from the Houston Press who said, \\"Seriously, \\"Health is the New Drug\\" is the best song we've heard this year.\\" An animated music video for Better Daze was released at the end of 2012. The video depicts a meteor filled with dark life forms plummeting into Earth releasing bizarre creatures on Austin, TX. Directed by Eric Power the video combines live action with cut paper shadow animation filmed on a green screen. Houston Press ranked Better Daze number 15 in their Top 25 music videos of 2012. Big Hits! Big Hits! is the first full-length album released by The Boxing Lesson in five years. It's more rock-oriented than The Boxing Lesson's past albums and is produced by Chris \\"Frenchie\\" Smith (...And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead, The Darkness, Dandy Warhols, Ringo Deathstarr) at The Bubble in Austin, TX. Big Hits! was released at SXSW 2013 to positive reviews. The Austin Chronicle gave it 3 ¬Ω stars and said, ‚ÄúArms buried deep in galactic mud, the Boxing Lesson takes an outer space journey to the center of the Earth.‚Äù Making this new album was no easy fight for the Boxing Lesson. When Paul Waclawsky and keyboardist Jaylinn Davidson began writing the band's second LP four punishing years ago, they planned to name it Possibilities. Only after enduring a long and merciless beatdown of bad luck and creative interruptions did they come to curse that title. The album was mixed by Kevin Butler at Test Tube Audio, and mastered off analog tape by Jerry Tubb at Terra Nova in Austin, TX. The results brought the project to completion, except for the album name. Utilizing a clever triple entendre, they renamed it Big Hits! and emerged with a 12th round knockout. Musical style The band's sound primarily is built around a psychedelic space rock ethos, with Paul Waclawsky's dark melodic guitar work using reverb, fuzz, and tape delay effects, and Jaylinn Davidson's heavy use of Moog synthesizers. The band has not had a stringed bass player since relocating to Austin, the rhythmic function of the bassline is instead performed on the synth. Haunting vocals and moody melodies are punctuated by mesmerizing guitars, droney beats and expressive electronica. The Boxing Lesson plays \\"space\\" rock that can transport the listener to another dimension and beyond. Culturespill blog said, \\"An up-and-coming threesome out of Austin, Texas, The Boxing Lesson betray a rather thinly veiled affinity for Pink Floyd but they roughen the edges of that influence with an open-armed embrace of Spacemen 3, The Cure, Radiohead and Broken Social Scene. Craig Franklin from Halo-17 Australia wrote, \\"Not enough bands make music like The Boxing Lesson any more. Over the course of three EPs, they've managed to create some truly breathtaking and epic music that draw the dots between such seemingly disparate bands as Pink Floyd, My Bloody Valentine and David Bowie. They're equally at home writing short, concise pop songs, and kicking out the jams. They use a Moog synth extensively. In short, unlike a lot of bands, they're consistently 'interesting'.\\" Discography * Big Hits!

Name  The name Populus is from the Latin for poplar, and grandidentata refers to the coarse teeth on the leaves (grandis meaning \\"large\\", and dentata meaning \\"toothed\\").  Description  Populus grandidentata is a medium-sized deciduous tree native to North America, found mostly in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. Leaves are similar to Populus tremuloides, but slightly larger and having larger teeth. The leaves tremble in the wind as P. tremuloides does. Bark of younger trees is olive-green, thin and smooth; after 30‚Äì40 years, the bark is gray, thick and rough with grooves.  Reproduction  Bigtooth aspens produce seeds from wind-pollinated flower clusters, known as catkins. The tree is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are on separate trees, which flower from mid-April to mid-May depending on the climate zone. The seed, a two-valved capsule, is distributed widely by the wind. Seed production begins around 10 years old. Individuals can also reproduce through the roots after a disturbance event, such as fire or harvest; the roots of the dead/cut tree will begin to send up suckers, creating identical individuals, and can result in a stand of clones that resemble that individual. Seeds viability is high (around 80%) but despite this and the sheer number of seeds produced (a mature tree can produce over 1 million per season), very few actually end up germinating due to their short viability (two weeks), natural growth inhibitor, and high likelihood of landing in spots unsuitable for germination, which must be done on the surface of moist soil.  Growth  Bigtooth aspens are dioecious, medium-sized deciduous trees with straight trunks and gently ascending branches. Heights at maturity are around with diameters of . They are fast growing and are relatively short-lived; stands will begin to deteriorate after 60‚Äì70 years, while individuals can live up to 100 years. They often constitute early successional species of their landscapes. Roots are shallow and wide spreading; lateral root growth in a forest may be as far as . Generally, four to five lateral roots originate from the tree, and then branch within ; vertical, penetrating roots near the base anchor the tree.  Distribution  The range of Populus grandidentata extends from Virginia north to Maine and Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia; west to southeastern Manitoba and Minnesota; south through Iowa to extreme northeastern Missouri; and east through Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and West Virginia. Disjunct populations are found in Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina.  Ecology  The species is able to adapt to a wide range of soils, though it is most abundant on sands, loamy sands and light sandy loams. Big-tooth aspens can tolerate sandy uplands and high, rocky sites. The depth to the water table is generally about . Soil must be moist but well-aerated for good growth. Being very shade intolerant, most shaded stems die. They are pioneer species on disturbed sites, persisting in successional communities until senescence. Rapid height growth of suckers allows it to outcompete other sprouting species such as red oak (Quercus rubra) and red maple (Acer rubrum) on many sites. In the absence of disturbance, it is soon replaced by conifers and hardwoods. In the Great Lakes Region at the turn of the 20th century, many mature pine forests were logged and burned. Bigtooth and quaking aspens frequently dominated the postdisturbance forests. Without fire or other disturbance, these forests are being replaced by later successional, shade-tolerant species. This aspen usually grows in even-aged, mixed stands, most commonly with quaking aspens. Codominant in both hardwood and conifer forests, it does not occur as a subdominant because of its extreme shade intolerance. Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) is the predominant species in aspen stands in the Great Lakes region, but bigtooth aspen dominates on drier, upland sites. Aspen stands dominated by bigtooth aspens are generally more open than those dominated by quaking aspens. It is more disease resistant than P. tremuloides. The most serious disease is hypoxylon canker (caused by Entoleuca mammata). Other rots, fungi, and root decay affect this species. A preferred host of gypsy moth, death occurs when nearly complete defoliation by gypsy moths is followed by a fungal infection by Armillaria spp. The ambrosia beetle (Xyleborus saxesceni) attacks fire-damaged bigtooth aspens. Commonly, it occurs in areas that frequently burn, such as large upland areas distant from water and upwind of natural fire breaks, such as lakes.  Uses  Various wildlife feed on the bark, foliage, and twig buds. The wood weighs 27 pounds (12 kg) per foot and is light-colored, straight-grained, fine-textured, and soft. It is used primarily for pulp, but can be used to make particle board and structural panels. Minor uses include log homes, pallets, boxes, match splints, chopsticks, hockey stick components, and ladders. The bark is pelletized for fuel and supplemental cattle feed.

The diamond is cut into a cushion shape and weighs . The Star of the South is graded as a type IIa diamond, with a colour grading of fancy light pinkish-brown and a clarity of VS2. At the time of discovery, the diamond weighed . It has passed through the hands of many owners, including the Maharaja of princely Baroda State, and its last known purchase was by Cartier, the French luxury jeweller around 2002, when it was sold to them by Rustomjee Jamsetjee of Mumbai. The light reflected by the diamond is white, and the refracted light is of a rose tint. This gives the diamond its light pinkish-brown hue. History The diamond was found by Madi Magassa in 1853, at the Bagagem River in the city now called Estrela do Sul Diamond Mines in Brazil. It was handed over to her master, Casimiro de Moraes, who rewarded her for finding the diamond by granting her freedom and a pension for life. Casimiro de Moraes later sold it for ¬£3,000, a price far lower than its actual value. The buyer deposited the diamond at the Bank of Rio de Janeiro for ¬£30,000. The uncut diamond was passed through the hands of several buyers, until it was bought by Costers of Amsterdam for ¬£35,000. It was then cut into an oval cushion shape by a cutter named Voorsanger, renowned for having been one of the two men who refashioned the Koh-i-Noor. It was purchased by Halphen and Associates of Paris, a syndicate of diamond merchants, who named it Estrela do Sul, or Star of the South. The syndicate exhibited the diamond in 1862 at the Great London Exposition, and again in 1867 at the International Exposition in Paris. On both occasions, the Star of the South received considerable attention. The diamond was later sent to a diamond dealing house in India, where negotiations were carried out to sell it to a Maharajah for a price of ¬£110,000. However, this deal was not successful and the diamond was returned to Halphen and Associates. During the diamond‚Äôs stay in India, Prince MalhƒÅr RƒÅo of the royal family of Gaekwad got to know about the stone. He instructed E. H. Dresden of London to purchase the diamond, who purchased it from Halphen and Associates for ¬£80,000 on behalf of the prince. The Star of the South was in the possession of the Gaekwad family for several years. It was later mounted on a necklace along with the English Dresden diamond. The Pittsburgh Press reported in 1927, the diamond necklace which contained the Star of the South diamond, as a part of the royal collection worth $10,000,000 at the time, housed in the Nazarbaug Palace in Baroda; another important part of the collection was a cloth embroidered with precious stones and seed pearls, made to cover the tomb of Mohammed. In 1934, Prince MalhƒÅr RƒÅo‚Äôs son told Robert M. Shipley, an American gemologist about this. In 1948, the Maharani Sƒ´tƒÅ Devƒ´, was photographed wearing the necklace at her husband Maharajah PratƒÅp Sinh's birthday party. The Star of the South was later purchased by Rustomjee Jamsetjee of Mumbai, who sold it to Cartier in 2002. Characteristics At the time of discovery, the diamond had a rhombic dodecahedral form with obtuse angles and twenty four facets. There was a deep depression in one of the facets, indicating that it had accommodated another octahedral crystal. A few black specks were also present, caused by titanic iron or volcanic sand. The diamond originally weighed and was cut into an oval cushion shape weighing , losing almost half of its weight in the cutting process. The dimensions of the Star of the South were 35 mm x 29 mm x 19 mm. The light reflected by the diamond is white, and the refracted light is of a rose tint. This is attributed to the prismatic form given to the crystal during its cutting. The Star of the South has a colour grading of light pinkish-brown, pink and brown being two colours that can show up in colourless diamonds of type IIa. It is a plastically deformed diamond of type IIa, and has a clarity of VS2. Dispute After the diamond was purchased by Cartier, SangrƒÅm Sinh, the youngest son of Maharaja PratƒÅp Sinh Gaekwad of Baroda State, claimed that the Star of the South was among the heirlooms, the ownership of which was being disputed by the Gaekwad family. The diamond had been included in inventories disclosed in wealth tax returns filed in 1988 by FƒÅteh Sinh RƒÅo Gaekwad and his wife, heirs of the Gaekwad family. SangrƒÅm Sinh has announced that he intends to trace how the diamond had reached Cartier and is considering possible legal action.

The 20-story building was designed by Clinton & Russell and built between 1900 and 1902 for the Alliance Realty Company as a speculative office building. The Broad Exchange Building's articulation consists of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column, namely a base, shaft, and capital. The lowest three stories of the facade are clad with rusticated granite blocks; the fourteen-story shaft is clad with brick; and the three-story capital is clad with granite and terracotta, topped by a copper cornice. Inside, the building originally contained office space, but , has 307 residential units. With of rental space in total, the Broad Exchange Building was Manhattan's largest office building upon its completion. Due to the Broad Exchange Building's proximity to the New York Stock Exchange Building, many financial firms sought space in the building. The Broad Exchange Building was sold off numerous times in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The Broad Exchange Building was gutted and renovated into apartments in the late 1990s, and a southern wing of the building was demolished in the early 21st century. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998, and was designated a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2000.  Site  The Broad Exchange Building is located in the Financial District of Manhattan, at the southeast corner of Broad Street and Exchange Place. The block on which the building is located is bounded by Broad Street to the west, Exchange Place to the north, William Street to the east, and Beaver Street to the south. The Broad Exchange Building has of frontage on Broad Street and on Exchange Place. As designed, the building was shaped in an irregular \\"T\\" with a wing going southward toward Beaver Street. According to a 1909 advertisement, the building originally occupied of space. The southern wing was demolished in the early 2010s. The building is adjacent to 15 Broad Street to the north, the New York Stock Exchange Building to the northwest, the Continental Bank Building to the west, and 45 Broad Street to the south. In addition, 55 Wall Street and 20 Exchange Place are less than one block east, and Federal Hall is one block north. Historically, the Broad Exchange Building also abutted the Corn Exchange Bank at William and Beaver Streets, a site later taken up by 15 William Street. Flanking the main building entrance on Broad Street are two staircase entrances for the Broad Street station on the New York City Subway's Nassau Street Line (served by the ).  Design  The building was designed by Clinton and Russell in the Italian Renaissance Revival style. Emporis gives its height as , though a Real Estate Record and Guide article published during the building's construction stated that the structure was to be tall. Sources differ on whether the building has 20 or 21 stories. = Facade = Side entrance on Exchange Place The primary elevation on Broad Street contains 10 vertical bays, while the Exchange Place elevation has 26 bays. The Broad Exchange Building's articulation consists of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column, namely a base, shaft, and capital. The lowest three stories of the facade are clad with rusticated granite blocks. The fourteen-story shaft is generally clad with brick and contains terracotta trim. The highest three stories contain a facade of granite and terracotta, topped by a copper cornice. At ground level, there is an entrance portico projecting slightly from the center of the Broad Street elevation, measuring two bays wide and two stories high. The portico consists of fluted Doric columns supporting an entablature with the text , underneath which is a cast- iron aedicule containing the main doors. On either side of the portico are two stories of paired sash windows flanked by granite pilasters, with cast-iron vertical mullions and decorated cast-iron horizontal spandrels. The six center bays at the 3rd story are topped by an alternating series of four granite modillions and three heads depicting Greek figures. The secondary entrance on Exchange Place is similar to that on Broad Street, except that this entrance is six bays wide, has no projecting portico, and contains wall niches containing bronze lamps. There are two tertiary entrances along Exchange Place as well. A frieze runs above the second floor, and a granite string course runs above the 3rd floor. The 4th through 17th stories are clad with brick, except for the two outermost bays on either end of the Exchange Place and Broad Street elevations, which are instead clad with rusticated terracotta. In the six center bays on the Exchange Place and Broad Street elevations, there are elaborate cartouches between the 4th and 5th floors, and two cartouches and three lions' heads between the 16th and 17th stories. A terracotta string course runs above the 17th story. These elevations contain one rectangular window opening in each bay. The 18th through 20th stories comprise the attic; the two outermost bays on either end of the Exchange Place and Broad Street elevations are clad with rusticated terracotta. On the 18th and 19th story along Exchange Place, three of the pairs of bays are flanked by a pair of Ionic columns. A copper cornice runs above the 20th story. A penthouse, sometimes considered the 21st story, is atop the roof. The rear elevations are composed mostly of brick, as was the now-demolished south wing, and contain arched and rectangular window openings. The east elevation, now mostly concealed, contained cornices above the 16th and 20th floors. The south wing was topped by a decorative cartouche similar to those on the Exchange Place and Broad Street elevations. = Features = The Broad Exchange Building uses caisson foundations that descend to the bedrock layer, supporting the building's mass. The frame was made of structural steel, enabling it to be built to a taller height than previous buildings. There is a basement and subbasement with mechanical rooms, as well as large vaults. When built, the Broad Exchange Building was described as \\"a town under a single roof\\", with fourteen or eighteen elevators. It had of space in total and of rentable space, corresponding to on each floor. In the original configuration there were 40 offices per floor, but the floors were arranged in an open plan layout. The lowest four floors were targeted toward bankers and banking firms, with ceilings. Since residential conversion, the building has had 307 residential condominium units. These consist of 168 one-bedroom units, 135 two-bedroom units, and four penthouse apartments. Each condominium has ceilings measuring high, wooden floors, and glass bathroom tiles. In addition, the units have appliances such as washer-dryers, while the penthouses have outdoor terraces of between . The building's amenities include a shared lounge for residents; a room for games and simulations; indoor and outdoor play areas for children; a dog grooming salon; and a shared rooftop terrace. After its conversion, the building contained five elevators. The lobby measures long and is shaped in a \\"T\\". The longer leg of the \\"T\\" extends west‚Äìeast from Broad Street, while a shorter north‚Äìsouth passageway extends from Exchange Place and intersects with the west‚Äìeast corridor. Two classical staircases flank the corridor leading from Exchange Place and lead to a mezzanine. The walls in the lobby are clad with marble, and contain marble pilasters topped by Corinthian capitals. On the lobby's eastern wall are the five remaining elevators, with stainless steel doors. The lobby's ceiling is made of plaster beams with overhanging lighting fixtures. Four commercial spaces abut the lobby. After rental conversion in the 1990s, the lobby was used as a leasing office by its first owner Crescent Heights; Swig Equities converted it into a party space during the 2000s, and LCOR converted it into a lounge in the 2010s.  History  = Construction = Depicted in 1902 During the late 19th century, builders began erecting tall office buildings in New York City, especially in Lower Manhattan, where they were compelled to build tall structures due to a lack of available land. One such project was headed by the Alliance Realty Company, who hired Clinton & Russell in 1900 to design a speculative development at 25 Broad Street, near Exchange Place. The George A. Fuller Company was hired as the contractor. The structural steelwork was designed by civil engineer Marion S. Parker. In June 1900, Alliance Realty transferred ownership to the Broad Exchange Company, in which Fuller was involved, for $4 million. The Broad Exchange Company then secured a $2.25 million construction loan from the Equitable Life Assurance Society. Contemporary media reported that the building was occupied by late April or early May 1901. The building was officially completed in 1902, and was Manhattan's largest office building, with of space available for rent. The next largest buildings in Manhattan were the Bowling Green Offices Building, Equitable Life Building, and 42 Broadway, which each only had two-thirds of the space that the Broad Exchange Building had. The Architectural Record observed contemporaneously that New York City buildings like the Broad Exchange Building were increasingly being erected by holding companies \\"organized to 'finance' such big undertakings\\" rather than their owners. = Early 20th century = Financial firms began moving into the Broad Exchange Building because it was close to the New York Stock Exchange. The building provided office space for financial companies such as Paine Webber, who occupied the space starting in 1909, and Hayden, Stone & Co., which moved in during 1906. The New York Curb Exchange took space in the Broad Exchange Building in 1911, and remained there until the Curb Exchange Building opened in 1921. The Pierce Oil Corporation's offices in the building were described by The New York Times as being \\"among the most handsome in the financial district\\". Other tenants included brokers Carl H. Pforzheimer and Company, as well as investment bankers Stephen Trask and Company. In addition, the City Midday Club was housed on the building's 20th floor from 1901 to 1945. When the Broad Exchange Building was built, there existed a public alleyway called Lord's Court east of the building's southern wing; the alleyway connected to 53 Beaver Street. The owner of 53 Beaver Street sued Broad Exchange Company in 1905 after the company delivered coal and hauled out ashes to Beaver Street, and the company was subsequently found to have no right to use the alleyway. The Broad Exchange Company then bought a four-story building at 41 Broad Street for $325,000 () so it could transport the coal and ashes through 41 Broad Street, and then leased out the upper floors of that building. The Broad Exchange Building and 41 Broad Street were remortgaged in 1909 for $3.45 million. Three years later, the Broad Exchange Company announced plans to replace 41 Broad Street, \\"one of the most expensive coal chutes in this country\\", with an annex to the Broad Exchange Building. In 1921, the Broad Exchange Company bought outright the six-story building at 53 Beaver Street, providing an alternate entrance to the Broad Exchange Building. Broad Exchange and Alliance Realty acquired all of the Broad Street blockfront by 1922, although not all of these lots would become part of the Broad Exchange Building. = Mid- and late 20th century = 25 Broad Street was owned by the Broad Exchange Company until 1940, when Prudential Financial took over the building for $500,000 as part of foreclosure proceedings against the Broad Exchange Company. At the time, the property was assessed as being worth $5.6 million. During the mid-1940s, the building remained nearly 100% occupied, and one of the major lessees was the United States Department of War. 25 Broad Street was purchased by the City Investing Company in 1945, at which point its worth was assessed at $4.85 million. Walker & Gillette renovated the storefronts shortly afterward, adding two entrances on Exchange Place. Harry Helmsley bought the building in 1952 for $6.5 million. Several major tenants moved out during the late 20th century. Hayden, Stone & Co. moved out during 1970; Paine Webber & Co. moved its headquarters elsewhere in 1979, though some of the company's operations remained in 25 Broad Street through at least 1983. In 1979, JPMorgan Chase bought 25 Broad Street and the adjacent 27 William Street for $20 million. The building was still 75% occupied at the time. JPMorgan planned to replace 25 Broad Street with a new office tower to serve as its headquarters, but put it for sale in 1981 after failing to do so. Olympia and York subsequently bought 25 Broad Street for $20.5 million, also planning to build an office tower, and also failing. In 1984, Joseph Neumann bought the building for $73 million in cash, assuming $58 million of the previous owners' debt, with the intention to build a headquarters for Kidder, Peabody & Co. on the site. Neumann's consortium spent $18 million to restore the building for office use until it ran out of money. After the 1987 stock market crash, Neumann locked up 25 Broad Street in 1988, and the building sat empty for the next four years, during which it was looted. Neumann defaulted on the $58 million loan in 1989. The mortgage- holder, American Savings and Loan Association went out of business, and Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation assumed the mortgage, while a consortium headed by Robert Bass assumed property management duties. = Residential conversion = Seen at ground level New West placed 25 Broad Street for sale in 1992, and the next year, Arthur Shapolsky signed a contract to buy the building for $5.8 million. Shapolsky wished to convert the building to either apartments or record storage. Abe Hirschfeld and Bruce Menin bought 25 Broad Street in 1994 for $4.975 million, a price that The Wall Street Journal noted at the time as being cheaper than that of some Manhattan townhouses. Menin's firm Crescent Heights then began converting the building into 345 luxury apartments. Costas Kondylis, as well as John Cetra of CetraRuddy, devised a plan to renovate 25 Broad Street, in one of the first major commercial-to-residential conversion projects in Lower Manhattan. The original interior was completely removed for the project. The conversion was originally supposed to be completed in 1996, although a rental office opened in 1997 and the project was ultimately finished the next year. In total, the conversion had cost $100 million. Around the same time that the conversion was completed, city officials were considering a plan to purchase and raze the entire block upon which 25 Broad Street was located, erecting a new New York Stock Exchange building on the site. In 1998, Crescent Heights petitioned the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) to designate 25 Broad Street as a landmark to preclude such development. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 13, 1998, and was designated as a landmark by the LPC on June 27, 2000. About fifty tenants left the building after the September 11 attacks on the nearby World Trade Center in 2001, though these vacancies were quickly filled as part of a grant program to encourage people to live in Lower Manhattan. Crescent Heights put 25 Broad Street for sale in 2005, and Swig Equities purchased it for $260 million, planning to convert the building into a rental complex. Swig subsequently indicated plans to de-designate part of the building as a landmark, because it wished to demolish the southern wing above the first floor, transferring the air rights to its new residential skyscraper at 45 Broad Street. The local community board, Manhattan Community Board 1, endorsed the decertification. Under Swig's management, 25 Broad Street became known as the Exchange, and condominium sales launched in early 2007. Lehman Brothers Holdings made a mortgage on the building in 2007, but when Swig fell into default as a result of the 2007‚Äì2008 financial crisis, Lehman initiated foreclosure proceedings in January 2009. Lehman Brothers itself filed for bankruptcy in 2008, prompting Swig to close the sales office for the condos at 25 Broad Street. A court- appointed receiver designated LCOR, a subsidiary of the California State Teachers Retirement System, as the new developer for the rental project, and Lehman spent $39.9 million on preparing the building for conversion. In March 2011, Lehman sought permission from the judge overseeing its bankruptcy proceedings to restart work on the conversion, as well as demolish the south wing. The building's leasing office opened the next month. 25 Broad Street was auctioned in 2012 as part of the foreclosure proceeding against Swig, and LCOR made the winning bid of $170 million. After receiving approval from the LPC, LCOR spent another $50 million to renovate 25 Broad Street in 2013, demolishing the south wing and restoring the exterior to its early-20th- century appearance. The residential units were largely converted to luxury rentals and were mostly occupied by September 2013. However, the building had previously received a 421-g tax exemption, meant for developers converting Lower Manhattan buildings to residential use, and as such, some of the residential units were rent-stabilized. A judge ruled in 2015 that two rental tenants could stay in their rent-stabilized apartment, since they had not been given proper notice that the exemption for their unit was expiring. Most of the remaining units in 25 Broad Street were converted into condominium units, with sales launching in 2019. Booking.com ran a promotion at the building in January 2020, allowing people to stay in several of the unsold units for two nights. The same month, Regal Acquisitions bought the building's ground level storefronts. In July 2020, the developers announced that 15% of the condominium units were under contract, despite a general slowdown in real estate market due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City.

There have been four major sources of the slang: the First World War, the Second World War, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The name Digger slang derives from the cultural stereotype of the Digger in the First World War. Graham Seal AM, Professor of Folklore at Curtin University of Technology, calls the slang Diggerese. It is a combination of an occupational jargon and an in-group argot.  First World War  The first influence on Digger slang was Australia's involvement in the First World War. The soldiers themselves were not called Diggers until well into the war, the name first entering common use around 1917, with the first recorded use in something other than the traditional goldmining sense occurring in 1916. Originally, they were known as \\"Anzacs\\" after the abbreviation ANZAC for the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, a name that quickly entered the mainstream lexicon and was even the subject of federal legislation within a year of its coinage. The War Precautions Act forbade the use of \\"ANZAC\\" in the name of any private residence, boat, vehicle, or charitable institution, on penalty of a ¬£100 fine or six months in prison. The Australian government even petitioned the British government to enact similar restrictions. The men of the Australian Imperial Force, and the women who nursed them, coined many words of Digger slang, including \\"Blighty\\" for Great Britain (it being the name for a wound severe enough to get one returned to Britain for hospitalization), \\"chocolate soldiers\\" (and thence \\"chocs\\") for soldiers who were believed to be unwilling to fight, and \\"six-bob-a-day tourists\\" for the soldiers themselves (a reference to their daily wages of six shillings). As well as gaining slang versions of many French words from the areas in which the soldiers fought, such as \\"naipoo\\" for \\"no way\\" (taken from the French \\"il n'y a plus\\"), \\"tray bon\\" (from \\"tr√®s bon\\", and from which other Digger slang words such as \\"bonsterina\\" and \\"bontosher\\" were in turn derived), \\"plonk\\" (from \\"vin blanc\\") for cheap wine, and \\"cushy\\" for \\"easy\\"; the soldiers also incorporated Arabic words learned at their training grounds in Egypt, such as \\"saieeda\\" for \\"goodbye\\" and \\"imshi\\" for \\"go\\", and, most notably \\"bint\\" for a woman (who were also called \\"tabbies\\"). One slang phrase, going \\"to the top of the Wazir\\" derives its meaning, of doing something to excess, from a troop riot in the red light district Cairo on Good Friday 1915, over the prices being charged by prostitutes and the rumour that they were intentionally infecting the men with sexually transmitted diseases. Many military-related words and phrases were also coined. The slang name \\"daisy-cutter\\", for an anti-personnel bomb, originated with Anzac slang, for example. Soldiers lived in \\"dugouts\\", fired from \\"possies\\" (positions), and fought against \\"Johnny Turk\\" or \\"Jacko\\". And they suffered from the \\"Gallipoli Gallop\\", dysentery. Like the U.S. Navy's \\"scuttlebutt\\", rumours shared amongst soldiers around the water-wagons, manufactured by Furphy & Sons, were known as \\"Furphys\\". Some of the slang originated in the street slang of the larrikin pushes, such as \\"stoush\\" for \\"fight\\", which led to such words as \\"reinstoushments\\" for reinforcements. One of the essential components of the slang was the prolific (for the time) use of swearwords. Much of this slang was collected by W. H. Downing in his book Digger Dialects, which was published in 1919 (and reprinted in 1990).  Second World War  The second influence on Digger slang was Australia's involvement in the Second World War. Some of the soldiers who had fought in the First World War perpetuated Digger slang into the second. These \\"retreads\\" were fit enough to return to action and continued the use of terms such as \\"bint\\", \\"backsheesh\\" for money, \\"shoofti\\" for a look around (borrowed via British slang from Arabic), and \\"guts\\" for news and information. Several slang words and phrases evolved. What in the First World War had been a \\"base bludger\\", someone who hangs around headquarters avoiding the fighting (from \\"bludger\\", a British slang name for a pimp, and generally adopted as the name for any form of layabout), became a \\"base walloper\\" (also known as \\"fountain pen fusilier\\"), for example. Similarly, several new slang words and phrases appeared. A \\"shiny arse\\" was someone with a desk job at headquarters, and a \\"blue pencil warrior\\" was a propagandist. Many slang phrases were expressions of malcontent, such as \\"wouldn't it root ya?!\\", an expression of disgust, which came in many Bowdlerized variations, from \\"wouldn't it rotate yer?!\\" to \\"wouldn't it rot your socks?!\\". The shortened version of this, \\"wouldn't it?!\\" is still in use today. Anything thought to be nonsense was \\"a lot of cock\\" (sometimes \\"a lot of hot cock\\"). Something that was useless was \\"as much use as a cuntful of cold piss\\" (or \\"not worth a cuntful of cold water\\"), and a malfunctioning piece of equipment was \\"cactus\\" (originally 1940s RAAF slang, and briefly revived in the 1980s). Other Digger slang expressions involving complaint and error were \\"whinge\\", \\"balls-up\\", and \\"upter\\" (a contraction of \\"up to shit\\"). Food was called \\"afterbirth\\", a cook was a \\"bait layer\\", a quartermaster a \\"q bastard\\", and a sergeant's mess a \\"snake pit\\". Someone who wanted to \\"give the game to the blacks\\" was expressing unhappiness with the army or the war. One significant source of slang were the prisoner of war camps run by the Japanese, where Diggers sometimes ended up. These were the sources of many particularly strong expressions, such as \\"white nip\\" for a prisoner who collaborated with the Japanese, and \\"japs\\", \\"nips\\", \\"jeeps\\", \\"little yellow men\\", and \\"little yellow bastards\\" for the Japanese themselves. In the camps, \\"kippers\\" were the British POWs, and \\"cheese-eaters\\" the Dutch. The urinals were \\"pissaphones\\" and the stew served to prisoners was \\"Danube\\", a contraction of the rhyming slang \\"Blue Danube\\". There were many other Digger slang words and phrases coined during the Second World War. Two of the most notable are \\"wheelbarrow\\" for a conscript (because he had to be pushed) and \\"doover\\", a general name for just about anything at all. Others include \\"snarlers\\", who were soldiers from the Middle East who were \\"SNLR\\" (\\"Services No Longer Required\\") and sent home on \\"three P boats\\" (troopships that contained \\"pox, prisoners, and provosts\\").  Korean and Vietnam Wars  The third influence on Digger slang were Australia's involvement in the Korean War and its involvement in the Vietnam War. As with the Second World War, much of the slang was carried over, and some of it evolved. In the Second World War, a subaltern was \\"baggie-arsed\\", but was simply a \\"baggie\\" by the time of the Korean War. Similarly, the Second World War \\"mongaree\\" and \\"monga\\" for food, taken from Arabic as \\"mongy\\" was taken from the French \\"manger\\" in the First World War, and from which \\"hard monga\\" for iron rations and \\"soft monga\\" for ordinary food were derived, became \\"mongar\\", this time adopted from Italian. World War II \\"cock orange\\" for a commanding officer became a \\"cock oboe\\" in the Korean War. The Korean War introduced further words to Digger slang, which were re-used in the Vietnam War. One such was \\"hutchie\\", the equivalent to World War I \\"dugout\\", taken from the Japanese word for a house. The Vietnam War introduced \\"noggies\\" for Vietnamese in general (\\"gooks\\" being the North Vietnamese in particular), \\"frag\\" (shared with U.S. military slang) for a foolhardy officer killed by his own men, \\"bush-bash\\" (a reference to four-wheel driving practices in the Australian Outback) for a jungle patrol, \\"mammasan\\" for a madam of a brothel, and \\"Saigon rose\\" (or \\"Vietnamese rose\\") for a particular sexually transmitted disease. Other Digger slang words coined during the peacetime after the Second World War and that were then used in the wars were \\"nasho\\" for a national serviceman.  Modern Operations  Australia's involvement in numerous United Nations peacekeeping operations, regional stabilisation operations such as Bougainville and Solomon Islands, as well as East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan, have created new opportunities for Diggers to work and interact closely with soldiers and civilians from other nations. In Iraq, a local man was known as a \\"smufti\\". Getting sick from eating local food was known as \\"intestinal jihad\\". The American combat rations allocated to Diggers on combat patrols, Meals Ready to Eat (\\"MRE\\") were known as \\"Meals Ready to Excrete\\". A Digger who did not patrol outside of the wire was a \\"Fobbit\\", derived from the NATO acronym FOB (Forward Operating Base). Rifles were known as \\"bang-sticks\\", \\"tools\\" or a \\"woody\\". A task which went wrong was known as a \\"cluster-fuck\\" and if no-one was to blame then it was due to the \\"Inshallah factor\\". The slang term for the Middle Eastern areas of operations was referred to as the \\"Sand pit\\". A lazy Digger was known as a \\"jackman\\", \\"jack\\", or \\"oxygen-thief\\". \\"Jack\\" is most commonly used as an adjective for a person or behaviour that places the individual performing the action's interests ahead of those of the team. The term \\"Quoinker\\" is used to describe someone who would suck up, befriend or attempt to please persons of higher rank. This expression would also be used by mates of a soldier as they received an award, accolade or just general praise for a job well done. This is done by the soldiers mates to remind the praised soldier that they are not getting the award for hard work but for \\"Quoinking\\" Due to the institutionalised nature of military weapons training in Australia, a number of metaphors associated with rifle ranges were applied to operations. Combat was known as the \\"two way rifle range\\", returning fire to the enemy was known as \\"putting a few rounds down range\\", and coordinating Diggers for a large, long, boring or mundane job was known to be as exciting as a \\"brass party at Gallipoli\\" (brass parties painstakingly collect all of the expended ammunition cartridges off the ground at the completion of a rifle range practice). The boredom or repetitive mundane aspects of operations were described by the term \\"living the dream\\" or the American term \\"Groundhog Day\\".An item of equipment that is either of high quality or particularly useful may be described as \\"gucci.\\" These items are almost invariably not standard issue. Some slang has retained significant longevity and while finding its origins in previous conflicts are nevertheless still used by Diggers today. For example, medals were known as \\"gongs\\" or \\"tin\\". Common sense was known as \\"CDF\\" or \\"common dog fuck\\" and the morning of the last day in theatre of operations or exercise was known as a \\"wakey\\". The small metal spoon found in the Australian Defence Force's 24-hour combat ration pack, called a Field Ration Eating Device, was abbreviated to \\"FRED\\" (said to stand for Fucking Ridiculous Eating Device). Some Digger slang entered mainstream Australian English vocabulary. Some examples of this were \\"zap\\", \\"waste\\" or \\"turn into pink mist\\", all originally taken from U.S. military slang, meaning \\"to kill\\". Similar influence of Digger stereotyping on mainstream vocabulary has been the retention of \\"returned-servicemen\\" or \\"vets\\" for what in many other countries are called veterans. The latter name became more common in the 1980s with the creation of the Department of Veterans Affairs by the federal government, but \\"returned-servicemen\\" still remains in popular usage through the Returned Servicemen League clubs.

During the war, Briggs served as a captain with the 8th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. He was the colonel and first commander of the 10th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. After suffering serious wounds during the Battle of Fair Oaks in 1862, Briggs was promoted to brigadier general and served primarily administrative commands in Baltimore, Washington, D.C. and Alexandria, Virginia. He was, however, periodically assigned various brigade commands in the field for brief periods during the latter half of the war.Bowen, 890-891 Both prior to and after the war, Briggs was a lawyer and politician. He served as a state legislator, Massachusetts Auditor and a judge.Roe, 301-303. Early years Briggs was born to George Nixon Briggs, (governor of Massachusetts from 1844-1851) on August 1, 1824 in Lanesborough, Massachusetts. Henry Briggs graduated from Williams College in 1844 and was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar in 1848. On August 6, 1849, Briggs married Mary Elizabeth Talcott, daughter of Nathianiel P. Talcott of Lanesborough, Massachusetts. Shortly before the war, Briggs established a law practice in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. He took an interest in military affairs as well and became captain of a company of state militia in Pittsfield known as the \\"Allen Guards.\\" Briggs also took an active interest in politics. In 1856, he served as a member of the Massachusetts Legislature. Civil War service =8th Massachusetts= In the days following the attack on Fort Sumter, Briggs's company became Company K of the 8th Massachusetts. After reaching Maryland, Company K was detached from the regiment and assigned garrison duty at Fort McHenry near Baltimore. The company eventually rejoined the rest of the regiment and labored to repair and guard the railroads in the vicinity of Baltimore.Bowen, 183. =10th Massachusetts= On June 21, 1861, Briggs was detached from service with the 8th Massachusetts, promoted to colonel and placed in command of the newly formed 10th Massachusetts.Eicher, 144. The regiment reached Washington, D.C. on July 28 and spent the remainder of 1861 in camp near Washington, drilling and preparing for the spring campaign. The regiment was eventually attached to the IV Corps.Bowen, 197. In March 1862, Major General George B. McClellan commenced his Peninsular Campaign aimed at capturing the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. As the Army of the Potomac (of which the 10th Massachusetts was a part), moved by water to the Virginia Peninsula, Col. Briggs was placed in command of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division of the IV Corps on March 13, 1862. He served in this capacity until May 1862 when he was replaced by Brig. Gen. Charles Devens and returned to command the 10th Massachusetts.Bowen, 198. The 10th Massachusetts, led by Briggs, saw its first major action during the Battle of Fair Oaks on May 31, 1862. The regiment suffered severe casualties during this engagement and Col. Briggs was seriously wounded, shot through both legs.Bowen, 199. =Brigade commands= The severity of his wounds obliged Briggs to relinquish command of the 10th Massachusetts. He returned to Massachusetts for the remainder of the summer of 1862 to recover.Welsh, 36-37 For his \\"gallant conduct on the field\\" during the Battle of Fair Oaks, Briggs was promoted to brigadier general on July 17, 1862. In September 1862, Briggs was reassigned to command Camp Chase on Arlington Heights just outside Washington.Bowen, 590. This was a training camp for new regiments arriving in Washington from across the country. During the Maryland Campaign in September 1862, Briggs was briefly assigned to command the 2nd Brigade, 3rd Division of the V Corps taking several fresh regiments to reinforce McClellan's Army of the Potomac. Briggs, however, had not fully recovered from his wounds and was unable to take the field. In February 1863, Briggs was assigned to the Army's Middle Department, commanding a brigade in the VIII Corps serving guard duty in Maryland. Serving in this capacity until July 1863, Briggs's headquarters was in Baltimore. For two weeks in the latter part of July 1863, during the Confederate retreat from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Briggs was placed in command of a brigade of the 1st Division, I Corps. His brigade did not see any significant action during this time. August 1863 found Briggs in command of another training camp in Alexandria, Virginia known as the \\"Rendezvous for Draftees,\\" a post he maintained until July 1864. From that date until his resignation on December 4, 1865, Briggs served on court-martial boards in Washington. Post-war career As a civilian Briggs returned to a political and law career after the war. From 1865 to 1868, he served as Massachusetts Auditor. With the establishment of the District Court of Central Berkshire in 1869, Briggs was appointed a standing justice of that court in recognition of his law career and his duty on court-martial boards during the war. Briggs resigned from the bench in 1873. Briggs died of heart disease on September 23, 1887.

He was known for his harsh application of the law, such that officials travelling to and from his area of governance would say to each other \\"Better to face a nursing tigress than the wrath of Ning Cheng!\\" Life Ning Cheng initially served under Emperor Jing as a palace attendant and master of guests. He employed dishonest means to reach positions of power, eventually being appointed as chief commandant of Jinan. His predecessors in the post had all approached Zhi Du, the governor of Jinan, as though they were mere county officials owing to their fear of him, but Ning Cheng considered him an equal and sought to outdo him. Having known Ning Cheng by reputation, Zhi Du befriended him. Years later, after Zhi Du's death, Emperor Jing appointed Ning Cheng as a military commander in Changan in order to stymie the large number of crimes committed by imperial relatives. Ning Cheng emulated Zhi Du's style of governance and soon became an object of fear to everyone in the imperial family. Upon Emperor Wu's accession to the throne, he made Ning Cheng prefect of the capital. However, the emperor's in-laws took every opportunity to slander Ning Cheng, ultimately resulting in his conviction. Despite it being customary for high officials of the time to commit suicide when charged with a capital offence, Ning Cheng submitted to even the most severe of punishments. Eventually, he escaped and made his way home, forging papers in order to get through the pass. Declaring that \\"An official who can't advance to a salary of 2,000 piculs or a merchant who can't make at least 10,000,000 cash is not fit to be called a man!\\", Ning Cheng borrowed money and bought over 1,000 qing (equivalent to about 600 million square feet) of farmland on which he employed several thousand poor families to work. By the time a general amnesty was declared years later, he had amassed several thousand pieces of gold and exerted more power over the populace than the governor of the region did. Later, Emperor Wu took him out of retirement and made him chief commandant of Hangu Pass after Gongsun Hong's protests that he was like a \\"wolf driving a flock of sheep\\" had prevented Ning Cheng from becoming a provincial governor. When Yi Zong was travelling from Henei to Nanyang to take up a post of governor at the latter, Ning Cheng had retired again and was living in Nanyang. Despite meeting Yi Zong at the pass and escorting him on his way, Ning Cheng's courtesy was not reciprocated. Instead, Yi Zong pressed charges against the Ning family forthwith and utterly demolished their homes. As a result, Ning Cheng was convicted of an offence.

His sympathies were with the fringe Independent sects of the Commonwealth period, and after the English Restoration of 1660 his life was embattled. Richard Baxter criticized Bagshaw as \\"an Anabaptist, Fifth Monarchy man, and a Separatist\\".J. F. Maclear, Restoration Puritanism and the Idea of Liberty: The Case of Edward Bagshaw. Journal of Religious History Volume 16 Issue 1, pp. 1-17. (2007) Life His father Edward Bagshawe was a lawyer and politician. Henry Bagshaw (1632‚Äì1709) was his brother. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, where John Locke was also, when Bagshaw was a Student (i.e. Fellow of the college). Locke's Two Tracts on Government, representing more orthodox views of the time, were intended as replies to Bagshaw's views on religious toleration, published as The Great Question concerning things indifferent in religious worship in 1659.http://www.iep.utm.edu/l/locke-po.htmNicholas Tyacke (editor), The History of the University of Oxford: Volume IV: Seventeenth- Century Oxford (1984), p. 419. A position teaching at Westminster School in 1656 ended badly when he quarreled with headmaster Richard Busby. He was ordained in 1659 by Ralph Brownrigg,http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/DBY/Tilley/VolumeI/RidgeMarshSlackHalls.html and became vicar at Ambrosden, but was soon ejected for non-conformity. A large and acrimonious pamphlet literature grew up around Bagshaw, some of it generated by his hostility to George Morley, the Restoration bishop of Worcester (translated in 1662 to Winchester), and Dean of Christ Church from 1660. He was chaplain to Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey in 1661. He then spent a time imprisoned in the Tower of London, from early 1663.http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/strype/TransformServlet?page=book1_091, says 1662 i.e. 1662/3. He was attacked in print by Roger L'Estrange.Louis Edward Ingelhart, Press and Speech Freedoms in the World, from Antiquity Until 1998: A Chronology (1998). In the last year of his life he published a biography of Vavasor Powell. To the end he was also arguing out the separatist case against Richard Baxter, who hoped to keep dissenters (apart from the extremes) within the Church of England. Bagshaw hit out at Baxter's lukewarm position on dissent.Paul Chang-Ha Lim,, In Pursuit of Purity, Unity, and Liberty: Richard Baxter's Puritan Ecclesiology in Its Seventeenth-Century Context (2004), p. 151. In 1672, Baxter was still accusing Bagshaw of tricky polemics, in trying to draw discussion of the position of honest Nonconformist dissenters onto the touchy grounds of full toleration, politics and war.William M. Lamont, Richard Baxter and the Millennium (1979), p. 229.

This is in contrast to the lateral recording system which uses a stylus that cuts side-to-side across a record. The vertical recording process, also known as the hill and dale process, was used to record phonograph cylinder records as well as Edison Disc Records, Path√© disc records, and disc records made by numerous smaller companies. Vertical cut recording was also used as a means of copyright protection by the early Muzak 16-inch background music discs. In this process the stylus makes a vertical cut, its depth determined in accordance with the current in the recording coil. The grooves of vertically cut records have a constant separation and varying depth, as opposed to grooves of laterally cut records, which have a varying distance of separation and constant depth. Examining a vertically-cut groove along its length reveals a continuous wavy line as the needle cuts at different depths according to the tone and the loudness of the audio being recorded. These grooves show a transition from high to low peak as a smooth curve, giving the characteristic rounded 'hill and dale' effect to the groove, similar to the appearance of many geographic areas. Recording is by mechanical means and the vibrations from acoustic energy, transferred to a cutting needle, make the needle cut a deeper or shallower groove. It is necessary to set the parameters of the cutting depth accurately: too shallow a groove on silent sections and the playback device, also a needle, will slip out of place; too deep a groove risks cutting through the thin layer of recording medium and/or creating excessive wear when the recording is played back. Due to mechanical noise generated by the recording system, the needle is never totally still; total silence would produce a flat even depth groove, so the hill and dale effect exists over all the audio recording section.

By September that year the title track was recommended listening on Three D Radio. The original line-up of I Killed the Prom Queen consisted of vocalist Lee Stacy, guitarist Jona Weinhofen, drummer Josef Peters, bass guitarist Ben Engel and second guitarist Simon O'Gorman. The following year Michael Crafter, now synonymous with I Killed the Prom Queen and Australian Hardcore, joined the group to share the vocal duties.

It is the largest municipal airborne law enforcement organization in the United States and operates from the LAPD Hooper Heliport. While originally devoted to aerial traffic enforcement, it has grown to support a wide variety of police activity. Today, its operations are divided between Air Support To Regular Operations (ASTRO) and Special Flight Section (SFS). The ASD motto is The mission is the same, only the vehicle has changed. The Air Support Division currently operates 19 aircraft of 2 different models, and maintains the largest municipal police aviation unit around the world, in addition to having the world's largest roof-top airport and world's busiest heliport. History Hooper Heliport The Air Support Division (ASD) was established as the LAPD Helicopter Unit in 1956 with one Hiller UH-12C three-seat helicopter. They added a second helicopter in 1963 and a third in 1965. The city operated Bell 47G and 47J model helicopters. In 1968, the unit received its first turbine powered helicopter the Bell 206A JetRanger, which significantly decreased police response times. With a major expansion in 1974, the Helicopter Unit was renamed the Air Support Division. At that time, the ASD grew to 15 helicopters and one Cessna 210 manned by 77 sworn personnel. In 1976, the ASD added the Special Flight Section (SFS), a unit dedicated to supporting undercover police operations. In this support role, SFS is a significant contributor to narcotics and serialized criminal investigations. In 1989, the ASD added its first Aerospatiale AS350 B1. The city replaced all but 4 of the Bell 206 JetRangers and retired the older piston models. Two officers with at least three years of patrol car service fly in each air unit; they are armed and able to land and make arrests in areas not accessible by other means. Air units today provide aerial surveillance for vehicle pursuits, robberies, large crowd demonstrations, drug interdiction as well for SAR missions. Air units are automatically requested when initiating a traffic stop on a \\"code 37\\" vehicle, or suspect with known wants or warrants that are a felony in order to limit the potential for a pursuit. Aircraft will not fly during poor weather due to aviation safety. Mission Statement *To provide Air Support to patrol and specialized units of the Los Angeles Police Department. *To enhance officer and public safety, reduce the incidence of crime and thus reduce the fear of crime. *To accomplish this mission we will provide rapid response, tactical insight and airborne assessments of incidents, in a safe and professional manner. Fleet Today the Air Support Division consists of 88 sworn personnel and 19 helicopters which include two Bell 206B3 JetRangers, 10 Eurocopter AS-350B2 AStars, 4 Airbus H125 (AS-350B3e), one Bell 412 and one Beechcraft King Air 200 twin-engined aircraft. The city of Los Angeles briefly flew a fleet of Bell 407s in the late 1990s as a replacement for the AS-350B1s. However, in 2000 the LAPD started replacing the 407s with more powerful AS-350B2s. Two of the 407s were sold to the General Services Department which uses the helicopters on flights for the Department of Water and Power. =Current numbers= *10 American Eurocopter AS350 B2 A-Star *4 Airbus H125 *2 Bell 206 JetRanger *1 Bell 412 *1 Beechcraft King Air 200https://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/07/local/me-chief7 Accidents and incidents American Eurocopter AS350 B2 A-Star of the LAPD Air Support Division On November 30, 1964, Sergeant Norman D.

Ilnicki, were on traffic patrol in Air 1 (Bell 47G Reg.N1162W) flying in the vicinity of Dodger Stadium, and a media helicopter (Bell 47G reg. N1157W) was also in the area reporting on freeway traffic conditions. Air 1 and the media helicopter collided, resulting in the deaths of both officers and the occupants of the media helicopter. Policeman Ilnicki had about 401 hours of total flight time and 236 hours in type at the time of the crash On May 29, 1974, Commander Paul J. Gillen was killed when his helicopter crashed. On June 11, 1976, Officer Jeffrey B. Lindenberg was killed when the Bell 47G-5 helicopter (U.S. registration N7085J) he was training in lost power and crashed while landing. Lindenberg was practicing simulated urban high-rise rooftop landings at an off-site pad on top of a small mountain near the Los Angeles Zoo in the hills above Hollywood. On short final approach, the engine lost power and the helicopter impacted short of the pad. The Helicopter rolled down the mountain side . Lindenberg was killed and another officer was seriously injured. Lindenberg had been with the agency for seven years. Lindenberg was an experienced instrument rated pilot with 3575 hours of total flight time and 426 in type. On March 1, 1983, Reserve Officer Stuart Taira was killed as a result of a police helicopter crash. Taira, an observer for the helicopter unit, and two other officers were conducting aerial patrols following a tornado. In between patrols the officers were dispatched to investigate a report of a burglar on a roof. As the helicopter took off it struck a power line, causing it to crash. The officers survived the initial impact and Taira was able to exit the aircraft. Taira then returned to the aircraft in an attempt to rescue his two partners. One of the helicopter's rotors struck Taira in the head, killing him. Taira was posthumously awarded the department's Medal of Valor. On June 13, 1991, Officers Gary Alan Howe and Charles Randall Champe were killed when they experienced an in-flight engine failure which caused their helicopter to crash into a parking lot. They were flying an AS350B1 helicopter (U.S. registration N214LA).

He is most fondly remembered for his humorous feuilletons, which chronicled the everyday life of Warsaw and cultivated the Warsaw dialect. Stefan Wiechecki was born 10 August 1896. In inter-war Poland he collaborated with numerous Warsaw-based newspapers, initially as a court reporter. During numerous trials he documented typical personalities of the poorer, less-known part of the city with its distinctive culture, language and customs. With time he was given his own column in Express Wieczorny evening newspaper, where he published humorous sketches and feuilletons featuring personalities based on people taking part in trials he took part in. They gained much popularity and in late 1930s Wiechecki opened a chocolate shop in the borough of Praga, which became his main source of income. During the Warsaw Uprising, he was cut off from his house on the other side of the river, in the Old Town. There he collaborated with numerous newspapers published in the Polish-held part of town, notably the Powstaniec. Sharing the fate of the rest of Warsaw's civilians, Wiechecki was forced out of the city after the end of the uprising. However, he returned soon after the town was retaken from the Germans and resumed his duties as a journalist. Some of his humorous stories were published in book form, while others continued to be published by Warsaw- based newspapers. While criticised by linguists and polonists for filling the Polish language with trash, he was nevertheless considered a classic of the Warsaw dialect, at that time suppressed by schools along with all other non- standard variations of the literary language. One of the scientists to defend him in numerous articles was Bronis≈Çaw Wieczorkiewicz, who later published the first monograph on the dialects of Warsaw. A renowned Polish poet Julian Tuwim dubbed Wiechecki the Homer of Warsaw's streets and Warsaw's language, his feuilletons are also mentioned in the works of Antoni S≈Çonimski, Stefan Kisielewski and Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska. He died 26 July 1979 in Warsaw, where he is buried. After 1989 one of the main pedestrian-only zones of downtown Warsaw was officially named the Wiech Passage in honour of Wiechecki.

It was developed by John Ward Jenkins whilst developing heterogeneous catalysts for Shell Oil company, but was never patented. Process description A simple container (U-tube) is filled with a solid or catalyst. This sample vessel is positioned in a furnace with temperature control equipment. A thermocouple is placed in the solid for temperature measurement. The air originally present in the container is flushed out with an inert gas (nitrogen, argon). Flow controllers are used to add hydrogen (for example, 10% hydrogen in nitrogen). The composition of the gaseous mixture is measured at the exit of the sample container with appropriate detectors (thermal conductivity detector, mass spectrometer). Now, the sample in the oven is heated up on predefined values. Heating rates are usually between 1 K/min and 20 K/min. If a reduction takes place at a certain temperature, hydrogen is consumed, which is recorded by the detector. In practice the production of water is a more accurate way of measuring the reduction. This is due to the potential for varying hydrogen concentrations at the inlet, so the decrease in this number may not be precise, however as the starting concentration of water will be zero, any increase can be measured more accurately.

Design and construction Geyser was ordered on 12 March 1840 as the fourth of a class of six second-class steam vessels. She was laid down in August 1840 and launched on 6 April 1841. She was long on the gundeck and displaced 1,590 tons. Power for her paddles came from a Seaward & Capel 2-cylinder direct-acting steam engine developing 280 nominal horsepower,Winfield (2004), p.160 which was fitted at Woolwich in May 1841. Having conducted engine trials in the River Thames, she left Woolwich for Sheerness on 31 October 1841 to be coppered and made ready for sea. She was commissioned for the first time at Sheerness on 8 March 1842. Service history She served in the Mediterranean and the Levant in 1846. By December 1848 she was at the Cape of Good Hope. On 16 February 1850 she rescued the survivors of the barque Childe Harold, a passenger ship homeward bound from Australia. Childe Harold had struck the south east point of Dassen Island on the West Coast of South Africa. The only fatality was the Master, James Byres, who drowned while attempting to swim ashore with a line. She spent much of 1851 conducting anti-slavery patrols off the coast of Brazil. On 11 February 1851 she captured the slave brig Mangano in the vicinity of Rio de Janeiro. The slaver was sent for adjudication to the Vice-Admiralty Court at St. Helena, and in June 1851 she was sentenced to be restored to her master without costs. She was present at the Fleet Review at Spithead on 23 April 1856, and in 1857 was at Simon's Town in South Africa for patrols off the East Coast of Africa. On 23 June 1860 she was recommissioned at Devonport for service on the Home Station as a storeship. She was driven against the quayside in a gale at Plymouth on 14 January 1865 and was damaged. Fate Geyser was broken up in 1866.

The 1-benzylisoquinoline moiety can be identified within numerous compounds of pharmaceutical interest, such as moxaverine; but most notably it is found within the structures of a wide variety of plant natural products, collectively referred to as benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. This class is exemplified in part by the following compounds: papaverine, noscapine, codeine, morphine, apomorphine, berberine, tubocurarine. Biosynthesis (S)-Norcoclaurine (higenamine) has been identified as the central 1-benzyl-tetrahydro-isoquinoline precursor from which numerous complex biosynthetic pathways eventually emerge. These pathways collectively lead to the structurally disparate compounds comprising the broad classification of plant natural products referred to as benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIA), which have been comprehensively discussed by Hagel. The biosynthesis of (S)-norcoclaurine, which is catalyzed by (S)-norcoclaurine synthase, is accomplished by the stereoselective condensation of dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (4-HPAA); each of these compounds is prepared by multiple enzymatic transformations from L-tyrosine. It is of interest to note that early studies initially identified norlaudanosoline (tetrahydropapaveroline) as the purported central precursor for the biosynthesis of BIAs. However, more than two decades latter it was finely unequivocally established that (S)-norcoclaurine was the central precursor for the biosynthesis of the structurally diverse BIAs.

The group emerged in mid-1948 as the Voice of the Opposition, following a split from the Democratic Movement for National Liberation. Voice of the Opposition published Sawt al- brulitaria (ÿµŸàÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ±ŸàŸÑŸäÿ™ÿßÿ±Ÿäÿß, 'Voice of the Proletariat'). In December 1948 the group merged with the group Toward Bolshevik Organisation, becoming the Egyptian Communist Organisation.Beinin, Joel.

Was the Red Flag Flying There?: Marxist Politics and the Arab-Israeli Conflict in Egypt and Israel, 1948-1965\\\\. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990. p. 115 MISHMISH condemned the Egyptian military intervention in Palestine as a 'racist war'. It saw that war as a ploy of the Arab bourgeoisie, supported by imperialists, to divert the class struggle of Arab workers. The organisation called for Jewish self-determination in Palestine. In the view of MISHMISH Zionism would not be able to retain its dominance over Jewish politics in Palestine as the Jewish working class would be radicalised, and that Israel could develop into a socialist state. In 1949 MISHMISH was one of the bigger communist splinter groups, with several hundreds of members. Its relationship to other communist groups was however very bad. MISHMISH routinely dubbed the other communist groups as police informers, blaming them for arrests of communists. Moreover, it began to label all other Egyptian communist groups as 'Titoists'. In early 1949, two MISHMISH cadres were arrested in Alexandria. In August 1950 the Cairo-based leadership of the group (Sidney Solomon, Odette Solomon, Aslan Cohen, Miray Cohen and Mohamed Sid- Ahmed) was arrested.Beinin, Joel.

The most commonly used index from the family, FGT2, puts higher weight on the poverty of the poorest individuals, making it a combined measure of poverty and income inequality and a popular choice within development economics. The indices were introduced in a 1984 paper by economists Erik Thorbecke, Joel Greer, and James Foster. The individual indices within the family are derived by substituting different values of the parameter Œ± into the following equation: FGT_\\\\alpha=\\\\frac {1} {N} \\\\sum_{i=1}^H \\\\left(\\\\frac {z-y_i} {z}\\\\right)^\\\\alpha where z is the poverty threshold, N is the number of people in the economy, H is the number of poor (those with incomes at or below z), yi is the income of each individual i. If \\\\alpha is low then the FGT metric weights all the individuals with incomes below z roughly the same. The higher the value of Œ±, the greater the weight place on the poorest individuals. The higher the FGT statistic, the more poverty there is in an economy.  FGT0 and FGT1  With Œ± = 0, the formula reduces to the headcount ratio: the fraction of the population that lives below the poverty line. FGT_0=\\\\frac {H} {N} With Œ± = 1, the formula reduces to the poverty gap index. FGT_1=\\\\frac {1} {N} \\\\sum_{i=1}^H \\\\left(\\\\frac {z-y_i} {z}\\\\right) The FGT1 can be rewritten as: FGT_1=\\\\frac {H} {N} \\\\left(\\\\frac {z-\\\\bar{y}_p} {z}\\\\right) , where \\\\bar{y}_p=\\\\sum_{i=1}^H\\\\frac {y_i} {H} is the average income of the poor. Thus, the FGT1 can be expressed as the product of the FGT0 and the average income gap of the poor.  FGT2  While the two reduced indexes are widely used, the most common FGT-specific index in development economics is the Œ± = 2 version, which is the lowest (whole) parameter to weigh income inequality along with poverty. FGT_2=\\\\frac {1} {N} \\\\sum_{i=1}^H \\\\left(\\\\frac {z-y_i} {z}\\\\right)^2 The FGT2 can be rewritten as: FGT_2=\\\\frac {H} {N} [\\\\mu^2 + (1-\\\\mu^2) C_v^2] where Cv is the coefficient of variation among the incomes of the poor, H is the total number of the poor, and Œº is given by: \\\\mu=\\\\frac {1} {H}\\\\sum_{i=1}^H \\\\left(\\\\frac {z-y_i} {z}\\\\right) . Other decompositions of the index are also possible.Mauricio Olavarria-Gambi: \\"Poverty Reduction in Chile: has economic growth been enough?\\" , Journal of Human Development, Vol. 4, No. 1, 2003 The only measure that combines FGT0, FGT1, and the Gini index is the Sen index. In Mexico, this version of the index was used to allocate federal government funds between regions for educational, health, and nutritional programs benefiting the poor. In 2010, the Government of Mexico adopted a multidimensional poverty measure based on a variant of the FGT measure that is to be used in targeting the allocation of social funds to poor households at the municipality level.

Later in the series, it is revealed about Milhouse that both his middle name and his maternal family name is \\"Mussolini\\". Milhouse is Bart Simpson's best friend in Mrs. Krabappel's fourth grade class at Springfield Elementary School, and is insecure, gullible, and less popular than Bart. Milhouse is often led into trouble by Bart, who takes advantage of his friend's na√Øvet√©, and he is also a regular target for school bullies Nelson Muntz and his friends Jimbo Jones, Dolph Starbeam, and Kearney Zzyzwicz. He also has a crush on Bart's sister, Lisa, which is used as a plot element in many episodes. Milhouse is one of the few residents in Springfield with visible, in fact rather thick, eyebrows.  Profile  Milhouse is of Italian, Greek, Danish and Dutch descent, based on comments and characters introduced throughout the series. He has his mother's coloring, but none of her confidence. He has his father's facial features, as well as his father's primary personality features (which include disappointment, insecurity, and generally depressed demeanor). Milhouse is constantly bullied by Nelson Muntz, Jimbo Jones, Dolph Starbeam, and Kearney Zzyzwicz, to the point that when Bart questions Milhouse by saying \\"Milhouse! I thought you had a three o'clock wedgie with Nelson\\", in the episode \\"Little Orphan Millie\\", Milhouse simply responds \\"I had to reschedule\\". They do often inflict violence upon the geeky Milhouse, who wears thick eyeglasses, without which he cannot see. Although not disliked and having a moderate number of friends among other kids from school aside from Bart himself, Milhouse has made a career of getting victimized, although his overall true antagonists are the schoolyard bullies of Springfield Elementary (Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney). In \\"Sideshow Bob Roberts\\", Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney wrapped Milhouse in bumper stickers and placed him in a shopping cart. After Jimbo claimed that \\"the mummy's ready for his mystical journey!\\", the bullies pushed the cart with Milhouse down a very steep hill. He is harmed frequently, and on some occasions is injured by dangerous hazards, e.g., being run over by a train, falling down a waterfall, receiving electrical shocks, having his head polished to bone, and having his teeth knocked out by a hockey puck. As a lead character he always survives and recovers, often with no further mention of any injuries. He frequently visited a female psychiatrist until even she could not deal with his constant calling and blocked his number. On one occasion, Bart got Milhouse placed on the FBI's Most Wanted List even though they are friends, and tried to lure Milhouse into a cactus. Milhouse is not always subservient to Bart; in \\"Bart Sells His Soul\\", Milhouse toyed with Bart's anxiety after Bart sold his soul for $5, and Milhouse demanded $50 to return it. On another occasion, Bart introduced Milhouse to his girlfriend and had to explain why he and Milhouse are friends, but could not come up with a good answer and admitted it was due to geographical convenience. Bart did admit in \\"Little Orphan Millie\\" that he loves Milhouse.Bart: \\"Oh, I love him so much!\\" Homer also sometimes makes fun of Milhouse (once referring to Milhouse in the boy's presence as \\"that little wiener\\"). In \\"Burns, Baby Burns\\", Larry, Mr. Burns' son, brings Homer to eat at his house. Mr. Burns was angry and he asks Homer if his son \\"brings home nitwits and make you talk to them\\", to which Homer answers \\"Oh, all the time! Have you ever heard of this kid Milhouse? He's a little wiener who...\\", before being interrupted by Burns. In an attempt to purposefully enrage his father, Bart once stated that he felt \\"a little attracted to Milhouse\\", sending Homer into a rage. Bart and Milhouse appear to be the same height, but in the episode \\"Radioactive Man\\", it is revealed that Milhouse is at least an inch taller than Bart. Milhouse is frequently the butt of a variety of jokes, such as being beaten up by Nelson for delivering a love note from Lisa (which Nelson thought was from Milhouse himself), having the door slammed in his face while playing Pin the Tail on the Donkey, having his possible budding homosexuality given away by his school counselor to Homer and Marge by accidentally picking up the wrong folder while discussing Bart, making him a wanted fugitive (see above), inadvertently inheriting Bart's dismal permanent record at school through a side deal arranged between Bart, Edna Krabappel and Principal Skinner, which will disqualify Milhouse from \\"all but the hottest and noisiest jobs\\". He is fluent in Italian (\\"The Last of the Red Hat Mamas\\") due to visiting his maternal grandmother in Tuscany for two weeks every year. She hates the English language and did beat him whenever he spoke English, thus he was forced to learn Italian. He also began bed-wetting that summer. He helps Lisa learn Italian, but there is no reference to his Italian background or language skills in any other episode. Milhouse's personality drastically changes when speaking Italian, becoming a suave, confident ladies' man popular with Springfield's Italian community in the episode. The show's opening sequence, and various scenes of band practice suggests that Milhouse plays a brass or woodwind instrument, possibly clarinet or trumpet, but all the Springfield Elementary band members, besides Lisa, are very poor musicians. Milhouse is allergic to honey, wheat, dairy, mistletoe, holly, the red parts of candy canes, and his own tears. = Romance = Milhouse harbors a crush on Lisa, but they remain close friends, as shown in \\"Lisa's Date with Density\\", when she admits she liked Nelson. At the end of that episode, after she has stopped liking Nelson, Milhouse asks Lisa who will be her next crush; Lisa coyly answers that it could be anybody and Milhouse rejoices. His feelings for Lisa have been used in episodes set outside of the show's main story line. For example, the episode \\"Lisa's Wedding\\" shows what the future might hold for Springfield in fifteen years' time. Milhouse is Homer's boss at the nuclear plant, and after learning of Lisa's impending marriage, Milhouse recalls an earlier date with Lisa in which she said she might never marry, then angrily prepares Homer's annual review. Later in the episode, Lisa wonders if it is acceptable to wear a white wedding dress, suggesting that she had already lost her virginity; Marge, tells her \\"Milhouse doesn't count\\". In the episode \\"Holidays of Future Passed\\" (2011), set in the year 2041, Lisa and Milhouse are married and have a daughter, Zia. Lisa has always opposed the idea of going out with Milhouse (e.g. \\"Lisa's Date With Density\\" and \\"Future-Drama\\"), however after Milhouse starts tutoring Lisa in Italian and takes her to Springfield's Little Italy, she begins to develop a secret crush on him, until she caught Milhouse with a girl named Angelica in the episode \\"The Last of the Red Hat Mamas\\", and began hitting him and cursing in Italian just like his grandmother had done. Milhouse's first real girlfriend was Samantha Stanky, a new student who had moved to Springfield from Phoenix, Arizona in the episode \\"Bart's Friend Falls in Love\\". After her father who responds to Bart's call caught her and Milhouse kissing, he sent her to a Catholic girls' school run by French-Canadian nuns. While Milhouse's official first kiss was with Samantha Stanky in the aforementioned episode, it was contradicted in the episode \\"The Way We Weren't\\", where Milhouse accidentally kisses Homer, during a game of spin the bottle that Homer interrupted. In the episode \\"Homer Scissorhands\\", Milhouse dated a 5th grader, Taffy. The relationship ended when Milhouse and Taffy caught Lisa spying on them in the bushes. Taffy told Lisa that Milhouse still loves her, and Lisa kisses Milhouse. Lisa told Milhouse that he should not give up searching for other girls and that life has unexpected things to offer.  Creation  Milhouse was designed by Matt Groening for a Butterfinger commercial, and it was decided to use the character in the series.Groening, Matt. (2006). \\"A Bit From the Animators\\", illustrated commentary for \\"Lisa's Date with Density\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Milhouse was named after U.S. President Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. The name was the most \\"unfortunate name Matt Groening could think of for a kid\\". Years earlier, in a 1986 Life in Hell comic entitled \\"What to Name the Baby\\", Groening listed Milhouse as a name \\"no longer recommended\\". Milhouse is a favorite among the staff as Al Jean noted \\"most of the writers are more like Milhouse than Bart\\". His last name was given to him by Howard Gewirtz, a freelance writer who wrote the episode \\"Homer Defined\\". Gewirtz got the name from one of his wife's friends. According to Arden Myrin and Dana Gould (former writer and co- executive producer of The Simpsons), Rob Cohen (Simpsons writer) inspired Milhouse's look.\\"The Dana Gould Hour\\" for 2014-10-14 around 13m30s.

Whilst this idea was never implemented, Klein applied for- and received- a patent on June 30, 1959, and then wrote enthusiastically about this new idea to his dealer Iris Clert, asking her in particular not to mention the invention to her friend, the artist Takis, who had also been experimenting with air sculptures. This led to a serious argument with Clert, who tended to side with Takis, as well as re- opening a previous feud with Jean Tinguely. > \\"Their disagreement was so strong that Klein had removed all of his art from > Clert's gallery in August 1959 and had told her assistant to inform any > interested buyers that his paintings were all invisible and that if a buyer > wanted one, it would suffice to write a check. He further specified that the > check had to be very visible.\\"Yves Klein, Stich, Cantz 1995, n90 p268 Clert then told this anecdote to a number of visitors to her gallery, one of whom, Peppino Palazzoli, an Italian gallerist, expressed an interest in buying an invisible artwork from Klein; in an attempt to repair the friendship, Clert informed Klein of the sale. She also recommended that Klein design a 'proper receipt'. Palazzoli became the official owner of the first Zone on November 18 that year, having bought the work for 20 grams of gold, valued at $466.20 as of November 1, 2008Only Gold valuation website The reunion with Clert was to prove short-lived, however. By the end of 1959, he would sever his affiliation with her gallery, and the Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility would be their last collaboration. His next exhibition, the notorious Anthropom√©tries de l'epoque bleue, March 1960, (featuring models covered in blue paint pressing themselves on to canvases in front of an invited audience of notables) would be held in the considerably more upmarket Galerie Internationale d'Art Contemporain, on the Rive Droite. Yves Klein and Dino Buzzati engaged in the ritual transfer of immateriality, January 26, 1962 =The artist's book and Klein's use of gold= The book took the form of a parody of a banker's chequebook. Klein printed eight books of these receipts of which five surviveor at least claimed that he did; See Stich, n92, p268\\\\- apart from the first book (which contained 31 unnumbered checks for an unspecified amount of gold), each book contains 10 numbered receipts for a set value of gold; series one cheques cost 20 grams of gold, series four cost 160 grams. The value of the seventh book's cheques was listed in the Antagonismes Exhibition, Paris 1960, at 1,280 grams. Any gold that wasn't thrown into the Seine ended up in Klein's concurrent series of Monogolds; large scale works made of gold leaf. He had first come across the material's use in art whilst working in a framing workshop, Robert Savage's, in London 1949-50; he was also to encounter it used in golden Buddhas and screens whilst visiting Japan. Curiously, these encounters led Klein to associate the precious metal with immateriality; > \\"And the gold, it was something! These leaves that literally fluttered with > the least current of air on the flat cushion that one held in one hand, > while the other hand caught them in the wind with a knife.... What a > material! The illumination of matter in its deep physical quality, I came to > embrace it during that year at the 'Savage' frame shop.\\" KleinYves Klein, > quoted in Stich, Cantz 1995, p193 =The Ritual= The use of ritual is a theme running through Klein's work, from his exhibition Le Vide (The Void) 1958, in which he exhibited invisible works at Clert's gallery flanked by Republican Guards, to his elaborately planned wedding ceremony in 1962 and his votive offering to Saint Rita of Cascia (see ). Klein was fascinated by Catholicism & Buddhism, as well as being an enthusiastic member of the archaic group the Knights of the Order of Saint Sebastian.Yves Klein, Berggruen Hollein & Pfeiffer, Schirn 2004 p217 The obsession with the void, or nothingness, also runs throughout his work, with Le Vide (The Void) being the most famous example; for his second major exhibition at Iris Clert's, he emptied the entire gallery, painted it white (using his patented medium) and then persuaded the French government to send Republican Guards to stand outside as sentries, at the end of a hallway painted ultramarine, covered with blue curtains to ensure there would be no way of anticipating the gallery's contents. Anyone who didn't have an invitation was charged 1,500 frs. entrance fee.Yves Klein, Stich, Hayward Gallery, Cantz 1995, p134 It was estimated that between 2,500 and 3,000 people turned up for the opening,Yves Klein, Stich, Hayward Gallery, Cantz 1995, p138 and Clert decided to prolong the exhibition for an extra week to accommodate the 'several hundred' visitors each day.Yves Klein, Stich, Hayward Gallery, Cantz 1995, p139 > ‚ÄúHaving rejected nothingness, I discovered the void. The meaning of the > immaterial pictorial zones, extracted from the depth of the void which by > that time was of a very material order. Finding it unacceptable to sell > these immaterial zones for money, I insisted in exchange for the highest > quality of the immaterial, the highest quality of material payment ‚Äì a bar > of pure gold. Incredible as it may seem, I have actually sold a number of > these pictorial immaterial states . . . Painting no longer appeared to me to > be functionally related to the gaze, since during the blue monochrome period > of 1957 I became aware of what I called the pictorial sensibility. This > pictorial sensibility exists beyond our being and yet belongs in our sphere. > We hold no right of possession over life itself. It is only by the > intermediary of our taking possession of sensibility that we are able to > purchase life. Sensibility enables us to pursue life to the level of its > base material manifestations, in the exchange and barter that are the > universe of space, the immense totality of nature.‚Äù Yves Klein, from the > Chelsea Hotel Manifesto, 1961Quoted from Theory Now =Reception of the Work= The French press delighted in calling the event 'a scandal' (Klein Sells Wind!), but others were more impressed; Various members of the group present to watch Michael Blankfort's ritual transaction, for instance, on February 10, 1962, concurred that the event was 'extremely awe- inspiring', ending with the noonday chimes ringing out from churches all around Paris. Blankfort, a Hollywood writer, wrote later of having \\"no other experience in art equal to the depth of feeling of [the sale ceremony]. It evoked in me a shock of self-recognition and an explosion of awareness of time and space.\\"Blankfort quoted in Yves Klein, Stich, Cantz, 1995 p156 It has been suggested that the work is a response to Walter Benjamin's essay \\"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\\",Mark Cameron Boyd, Theory Now retrieved 01-11-08 in which he wrote ‚ÄúThe unique value of the ‚Äòauthentic‚Äô work of art has its basis in ritual, the location of its original use value.‚Äù\\"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\\" by Walter Benjamin If so, the Zones directly refute Benjamin's central argument, that modern mass production can finally \\"emancipate the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual\\". > \\"Believe me, one is not robbed when one buys such paintings; it is I who am > always robbed because I accept money.\\" Yves KleinQuoted in San Francisco > Chronicle References * Klein's Ritual For The Relinquishment of the Immaterial Pictorial Sensitivity Zones, quoted in Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art by Kristine Stiles & Peter Howard Selz * Yves Klein, Jean-Paul Ledeur, Editions Guy Pieters * Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery 1995, Cantz Editions * Yves Klein, Selected Writings, Tate Gallery * Yves Klein, Berggruen Hollein & Pfeiffer, Hatje Kantz 2004 =Notes= External links * Yves Klein Archive * A biography of the artist * The Chelsea Hotel Manifesto * An essay on Klein's obsession with the Void by Jason Beale * \\"Yves Klein's Zones of Immaterial Space\\", an essay by Jennifer Grant * \\"Odd Couple: Yves Klein and Ed Kienholz‚Äôs Unlikely Affinities\\", by Joanna Fiduccia * de sensibilit√© picturale immat√©rielle (1962-2012), by Marc de Verneuil and M√©lanie Marbach, January 26 2012, Paris Category:French art Category:Artists' books Category:Conceptual art Category:Nouveau r√©alisme Category:Modern art Category:Performances ","title":"Zone de Sensibilit√© Picturale Immat√©rielle"},{"id":"20037754","text":"The Norwegian Institute for Alcohol and Drug Research (, SIRUS) was a social science research institute based in Oslo, Norway.

Thora van Loon-Egidius, who lived in the house, was a lady-in- waiting for Wilhelmina of the Netherlands.

There are four sculptures on top of the house, representing Ceres, Mars, Minerva and Vulcan. The interior of the house has been renovated, and appears reminiscent of its look in the 18th-century, with wood paneling and stucco work. The upstairs features several paintings of Roman sports figures and a bedroom that is decorated with a Romanticism period painting of Italy. The house also has fake bedroom doors: the 18th-century owners desired to have symmetry in the interior design so they painted the real bedroom doors to match the walls and fake doors to appear real in a location where one would assume a door would be.

The service is available at no extra cost to existing Sky TV customers, with accessible content depending on the subscriber's Sky package. Non-Sky TV customers can access the service by subscribing on a pay-per-view basis. Sky Go is viewable on up to two devices, with the ability to increase this to four devices with Sky Go Extra for a monthly fee. The now-deprecated Microsoft Silverlight 3.0 browser plug-in is required to play content on computers. Due to viewing rights, certain programmes are not available to watch via Sky Go, and are 'blacked out' from the schedule. To have access to the full selection of live TV channels available on Sky Go, users will need a subscription to the relevant Sky TV packages that correspond to the available channels. History Sky Player on Windows Media Center It originally launched on 11 January 2006 as Sky by Broadband. On 25 November 2006 Sky announced that Sky By Broadband had been rebranded as Sky Anytime on PC. The rebranding also coincided with an update to the client, which included a new interface and a pay-per-view service for movies and US television shows. On 16 May 2008, Sky Anytime on PC was rebranded as Sky Player, along with updated software to include live simulcasts of Sky News and Sky Sports. On 29 October 2009, the service expanded on to the Xbox 360. An Xbox Live Gold subscription is required, and users need to register via the Sky Go website. Features include a party system which allows multiple users to watch content at the same time, with users represented by their Xbox 360 Avatars in a virtual room. Due to the high level of demand, the launch of the service was troublesome and technical issues caused the entire Sky Go platform to become unavailable. To rectify this, Sky decided to open up Sky Go on Xbox 360 to users incrementally over the following days. On 19 November 2009, Sky Player was also made available to Windows Media Center-equipped Windows 7 computers. Users of 3G phones on Vodafone, Orange, and T-Mobile could subscribe to Sky Mobile TV. The service consisted of three packages ‚Äî-Sky News, Sport and Factual Pack; Sky Entertainment Pack; and Sky Music Pack‚Äî-which include a mixture of live and made-for-mobile channels of broadcasters‚Äô channels.

The island is ,Coastline for the property \\"0612-235/1 Ut√∏en\\", according to Statens kartverk, http://seeiendom.no/ situated off the shore, by the E16 road, about driving distance south of H√∏nefoss, and northwest of Oslo city centre. Overview The ferry MS Thorbj√∏rn at the arrival pier at Ut√∏ya. The nearest white-painted house is one of the original houses on the island. Ut√∏ya is owned by the Workers' Youth League (AUF), a youth group associated with the Labour Party, which holds an annual summer camp there. The island is operated commercially by Ut√∏ya AS. The island is largely forested, with some open spaces. A small pier on the east side of the island is used to ferry people to and from Ut√∏ykaia on the mainland. There are also permanent buildings. Hovedhuset (\\"The Main House\\"), Stabburet (\\"The H√≥rreo\\"), and L√•ven (\\"The Barn\\") are located together near the dock. Up on the hillside (LO-toppen) are the main campgrounds, the cafeteria building, and the sanitary building. Skolestua (\\"The school house\\") is located further south. The name The first element ut means 'out', or 'outermost'; the last element √∏ya is the definite form of √∏y, meaning 'island'. Ut√∏ya is the southernmost (or farthest \\"out\\") island of three which lie in the lake of Tyrifjorden. The name is used in reference to its position in relation to two other islands (lying north of Ut√∏ya); Stor√∏ya (Big Isle) and Geit√∏ya (Goat Isle). Stor√∏ya is the northernmost, and Geit√∏ya lies between Ut√∏ya and Stor√∏ya. All of these islands were formerly used for herding (as is shown in the meaning of Geit√∏ya) by the people at Sundvollen. Ut√∏ya is quite clearly connected to the name of Utvika on the shoreside. History The island was a croft until purchased by the right wing politician Jens Bratlie in 1893. Bratlie used the property as a summer residence until 1933 when it was purchased by the Trade Union Confederation.Bergens tidende magasinet 21.juli 2012 s.13. The island was given as a commemorative gift by the Oslo Trade Union Confederation on 28 August 1950,Store Norske Leksikon: Ut√∏ya Retrieved 2011-07-24 and it has hosted several political organizations' summer camps. =2011 massacre = On 22 July 2011, a mass shooting took place at the AUF's summer youth camp, where 650 young people were staying. Anders Behring Breivik arrived alone on Ut√∏ya dressed as a police officer and told those on the island that he was there for security reasons following the explosions in Oslo which took place a few hours before. He then began shooting at individuals, continuing until the police arrived one hour after the first alarm call. The suspect immediately surrendered. Combined, the attacks in Oslo and Ut√∏ya left 77 dead, with 69 killed on the island, 33 of whom were under the age of 18.Terrorofrene p√• Ut√∏ya og i Oslo =After the massacre = \\"Rapidly it became clear, that ... [the bereaved] needed more time. [Construction work, or] The construction was put on hold for two years\\", according to the island's manager (as of 2016), J√∏rgen Frydnes. After the attack, several donations were given to AUF for the restoration of the island. Some of the buildings would be demolished, including [parts of] the cafeteria building where 13 people had been killed; some of the buildings have been demolished, as of 2016. With some disagreement having been bridged (as of 2016) - the future of Ut√∏ya has been the source of disagreements among the victims and family of the attacks. While AUF's planned to [rapidly] rebuild and return to Ut√∏ya, others wanted to leave the island as a memorial to the dead. The massacre at Ut√∏ya remains the deadliest mass shooting worldwide committed by a single gunman. Places and buildings Bays on the island's coastline include Bolsjevika. There are paths including Kj√¶rlighetsstien ([lovers' lane or]\\"the love path\\"). A hill - \\"used by discussion [groups]\\" leads to [a barn, according to its name,] Arbeidsmilj√∏l√•ven.

Thirteen people were killed inside, and several youths (escaped, or) jumped out open windows. Hegnhuset - consists of \\"Parts of the caf√© building (kaf√©bygget ) ..., where 13 people were killed ..., [that] have been preserved (as of 2016); around- and under the caf√© building - a [\\"learning center\\"] l√¶ringssenter\\" has been created; 69 columns support the roof, inside the glass walls (of the exterior of the building). 495 \\"safeguarding\\" planks - positioned vertical in the ground - enclose the building; with space - svalgang - between the planks and the building. \\"The house will protect the memory of the 69 who were killed at Ut√∏ya\\", a father (of one of the massacre's survivors) wrote in a news article. Etymology: The building has been named Hegnhuset - \\"a place that shall safeguard (hegne) democracy\\". A synonym of hegn is the imperative form of the verb \\"safeguard\\"; therefore Hegnhuset can mean \\"safeguard house\\" (with the determinate conjugation of \\"house\\"). Inside the caf√© building, preserved (as of 2016) are bullet holes in walls, \\"the open windows where several youths jumped out to escape\\" the murderer; an old chart (that was there in 2011) that says \\"you must know the past, to understand the present and peer into the future\\", and pictures of dead victims; at least one heart-shaped stone, with the inscription \\"Missing you [singular]\\", lies on the floor. In lillesalen (\\"the small hall\\") there is a piano; one was there during the crime. Court testimony has indicated that persons hiding behind the piano on 22 July 2011, were shot. In 2016 Oliver Wainwright named it the \\"top 10 buildings of 2016\\", adding that \\" the Hegnhuset on the island of Ut√∏ya makes a simple, powerful record of an event that shook the very foundations of Norway‚Äôs national identity. The cafe building, where Anders Breivik murdered ... before killing a further 50 on the island, has been retained as a stark relic, its walls sliced with Matta-Clark rawness, and encased in a simple timber and glass pavilion\\".

The Theatro Lyrico Fluminense (also spelled as Teatro L√≠rico Fluminense) was one of the main theatres in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during the mid-19th century and was for many years the primary theatre for opera performances in that city. It was demolished on 30 April 1875 to make way for a park.  History  Entrance to the Theatro Lyrico Fluminense, 19th century. Under the guard of the Brazilian National Archives. When the Theatro S√£o Pedro de Alc√¢ntara burned down in 1851, Rio de Janeiro was left without a theatre big enough to host the touring European opera, theatre and dance companies that had been performing in the city since the late 1820s. The city decided to build a new theatre as a matter of urgency. The theatre was originally intended to last for only three years, until the Theatro S√£o Pedro de Alc√¢ntara could be rebuilt. Its construction was entrusted to a relatively inexperienced contractor, Vicente Rodrigues, and work began on 29 September 1851. Initially called the Theatro Provis√≥rio (the Provisional Theatre), it was completed six months later. The contractor held a masked ball there on 21 February 1852, and on 25 March 1852, the theatre was officially inaugurated with a performance of Verdi's Macbeth. Ant√¥nio Carlos Gomes whose first opera, A noite do castelo, premiered at the Theatro Lyrico Fluminense in 1861. By 1854 the Theatro S√£o Pedro de Alc√¢ntara had been rebuilt, but it was decided to keep the Theatro Provis√≥rio as well. As the theatre was no longer \\"provisional\\", it was officially renamed the Theatro Lyrico Fluminense on 19 May 1854, celebrating with a performance of Verdi's Ernani. For the next twenty years it was the leading opera house in Rio. The first two operas by Brazil's most famous opera composer, Ant√¥nio Carlos Gomes were premiered at the theatre - A noite do castelo (1861) and Joana de Flandres (1862). In 1871, the theatre saw the Brazilian premiere of Gomes' most famous work, Il Guarany. In addition to its opera season, the theatre also put on plays and concerts with appearances by performers such as Adelaide Ristori and Sigismond Thalberg. Located in the Campo da Aclama√ß√£o, the theatre had a simple neoclassical facade. Its rose painted interior was more elaborate. The ceiling was decorated with portrait medallions honouring various composers and dramatists including Auber, Donizetti, Verdi, Bellini, Meyerbeer, Schiller, and Servandoni. In the center was Rossini surrounded by palm leaves and a laurel wreath. The arena section provided seating for 830 men (514 in seats, and 316 on benches). Seating for women and their escorts was provided by four tiers of boxes built of pine wood. However, the theatre's rapid and faulty construction led to many problems, not the least of which was the fear that it could collapse at any moment. There were also complaints about the poor acoustics and the ever-present dust that plagued the interior. The theatre was remodelled in 1865 when French tapestries and wallpaper, a ceiling fresco, and gas lighting were added. Its demise began with the inauguration of the more magnificent Theatro Dom Pedro II in 1871. The Theatro Dom Pedro had better acoustics, a slightly larger seating capacity, and was located in a more fashionable street. The Theatro Lyrico Fluminense gradually went into decline and was demolished on 30 April 1875 to make way for a park.

It consists of four movements: The Mission is used for NBC Nightly News, with variations used for some other NBC programs, Fugue for Changing Times was used for Before Hours during 1987‚Äì1988, Scherzo for Today was used for Today until 1990, and The Pulse of Events is used by Meet the Press and special breaking news reports.  History  At the time Williams was approached to write the NBC News suite, he was already well known for his work on Star Wars, Superman, and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. He was engaged because the network wanted to contrast with the synthesized music that was common for news programs at the time. Williams said that he wanted to convey the concepts of nobility of purpose, consistency, and dignity. The original recordings were made with an 80-piece orchestra.  Movements  The suite consists of four movements. The original recording included two versions of each movement to open and close each show, and eleven bumpers conveying varying moods. = The Mission = The first movement is also called The Mission, and has been used for NBC Nightly News since September 9, 1985. It has also been known as The Sound of the News. Its opening features a distinctive syncopated fanfare over a violin line. A reviewer for Slate compared it to the work of Richard Strauss and Aaron Copland, and noted that the piece makes \\"you feel that you‚Äôve been asked to join an exciting journey for truth\\". The Mission was re-recorded in October 2004 with a 100-piece orchestra conducted by Williams. This recording has a crisper and cleaner sound. The opening theme of The Mission was updated on November 29, 2004, and the closing theme of The Mission was updated on March 26, 2007, in preparation for Brian Williams succeeding Tom Brokaw as the anchor on Nightly News. Another update was made in 2011, containing only subtle changes. Variations of The Mission have also been used for NBC News at Sunrise prior to 1996, for The Chris Matthews Show, and for Today from 1990 until 2013, when it was replaced with a new piece by Adam Gubman conveying a \\"more newsy and less cinematic\\" sound. The theme has also been used on some NBC affiliates for their local newscasts. Australia's Seven Network adopted the original theme for its news bulletins in the late 1980s. Seven has since updated its version of the theme thrice‚Äîindependently from NBC‚Äîthat each have utilized a modernized \\"hard news\\" cadence compared to the original theme's strictly orchestral composition. Two Seven Network affiliates, Prime7 (for its Prime7 News broadcasts serving the subnetwork's affiliates in parts of New South Wales and Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory and the Queensland Gold Coast) and TNT (for its Southern Cross News) in Tasmania, also use the theme for their local news programming. Before 2015, the intro for the news of the Radio Television of Djibouti also used to feature a short part of this theme. = Fugue for Changing Times = Fugue for Changing Times was used for Before Hours, a 15-minute early morning business news program hosted by Bob Jamieson, which aired between March 1987 and September 1988. = Scherzo for Today = Scherzo for Today is a short two-minute piece composed for use as the opening theme of NBC's The Today Show. Its mood was intended to be celebratory and flashy. Like most scherzos, it is light and upbeat, and utilizes ternary or \\"ABA\\" form. The \\"A\\" theme, carried by the strings, is rather jumpy and loud, with the brass serving as a raucous accompaniment, and the \\"B\\" theme, the theme of The Today Show, is smoother and more melodic. The new music gave the program a distinctly modern and refined sound. The music was used until 1990, when it was replaced with a variation on The Mission. = The Pulse of Events = The Pulse of Events was originally intended for midterm election coverage on November 4, 1986NBC News Decision '86 Coverage and was later adopted by Meet the Press in 1990Credits of Meet the Press in 1990 and NBC News special reports in 1993.NBC News Special Report open in 1993 It was meant to convey a worldly and serious tone. Slate characterized the song as having \\"fast, complicated modulations that sound more urgent and wary than [The Mission]: They foreground the show‚Äôs relentless, logical ethos.\\" References Category:Compositions by John Williams Category:NBC News Category:Seven News Category:Television news music packages Category:1985 compositions ","title":"The Mission (theme music)"},{"id":"20038020","text":"Josiah H.
