He was born in 1958 and raised in a very musical family. He spent most of his childhood in a village called Bazou in western Cameroon where he was introduced to music. Like most children in his village, he began playing percussion and making instruments. However, with his Grandmother's assistance, Njacko met with the elders of the village who taught him to play music. He studied drumming (toum and kak), kalimba (also called the thumb piano, however, he plays with his fingers), percussion (various instruments), and an African harp called zaa koua. Early Life Njacko left Cameroon at the age of 17and continued his study of contemporary and traditional African music while he travelled in various Central and West African countries some of which include Nigeria, Benin, Togo, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Niger and Mali. During his travels, he resorted to doing various jobs during the day and working in clubs with different musicians at night. He eventually made his way to Paris by the time he was 21 years old. While living in Europe, Njacko continued to work as a musician, dancer, and choreographer and worked with groups like Africa Salimata, Ernest Ciss√©, Sosoba, Vinjama, and Mioso Mika. He also began his recording career with his first two albums in Amsterdam: Le Destin and Bamilek√© Reggae.  Career  Njacko currently lives in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, but he first arrived in Montr√©al, Quebec in 1989. He worked with other African artists, including the late Boubacar Diabat√©, Oumar Diay√©, and dancer Zab Maboungo.

She was commissioned in October 1804 under Commander Samuel Jackson. She served in the North Sea and the Baltic, and Jackson supervised the first successful rocket attack in Europe at Boulogne in 1806. After the war she served off Africa and captured some slavers. She was broken up in 1822, having been laid up since 1818. North Sea and Baltic On 28 December 1804 Musquito sent into Yarmouth Roads a large smuggling vessel carrying 1400 half-ankers of liquor, and some tobacco. The smuggler was the former King George Packet that the Dutch had detained at the beginning of the war.\\"Ship News\\". Morning Post (London, England), 31 December 31, 1804; Issue 11307. Lloyd's List (LL) had reported on 31 May 1803 that Earl of Leicester, Princess Royal, and King George Packet had been detained at Helv√∂et. The vessel was named Aurora and she and her cargo were sold at auction on 9 July 1805.\\"Advertisements & Notices\\". Ipswich Journal (Ipswich, England), 6 July 1805; Issue 3765. Musquito was off Scarborough on 12 April 1805 when Jackson saw two ships firing their guns at a third. Jackson caught up with the quarry, which turned out to be a sloop from Guernsey carrying contraband goods. Her captain informed Jackson his pursuers were French privateers. Jackson sailed in pursuit and captured one of the privateers at midday and the other early the following morning. The privateers were the Dutch-built doggers Orestes and Pylades. Each was armed with a 24-pounder carronade and six swivels and had a crew of 33 men. They had been at sea for three weeks, flying false Prussian colours. Their plan had been to attack merchant shipping off Scotland but bad weather had foiled them. Musquito sent both into Yarmouth.Lloyd's List, no. 4217, - accessed 16 May 2014.Lloyd's List, no. 4218, - accessed 16 May 2014. Later that year Musquito escorted transports carrying some 5,000 troops to Lord Cathcart's army in Hanover. By trusting his judgment over that of the pilots he was ordered to use, Jackson saved the convoy from grounding on the Haak Sand off Texel, although one transport did ground with the result that the Dutch captured her and the 250 men of the Fifth Regiment of Foot she was carrying.Marshall (1827), Supplement, Part 1, pp. 275-6. Later, Musquito drove five French armed schooners ashore on the Calais-Boulogne coast. On 27 March 1806, Musquito was with and the gun-brig when they captured Vrow Cornelia, R.R. Cruzenga, master. On 7 April Musquito, Monkey, and captured Bradford. Two days later, Musquito and Ariadne, and the gun-brigs , Bold, and captured Anna Margaretha, Klinkammer, master. On 14 April Musquito, Ariadne, Monkey, and Blazer captured the merchant vessel Elizabeth Anna. Then on 5 June Musquito was among the vessels that shared in the capture of Prospere, J.G. Huret, Master. Almost two months later, on 28 July, many of the same vessels shared in the capture of Jonge Jacob. \\"Use of rocket's from boats\\" - An illustration from William Congreve's book. During Commodore Edward Owen's rocket attack on the French flotilla at Boulogne in October 1806, Jackson directed the boats firing Congreve rockets. As night drew in on the Channel, 24 cutters fitted with rocket frames formed a line and fired some 400 rockets at Boulogne. The barrage took only 30 minutes. Apparently the attack set a number of fires but otherwise had limited effect. Still, the effect was enough to lead the British to employ rockets on a number of further occasions.Werrett (2009) This was the first successful use of rocket artillery in Europe. An earlier attack on Boulogne in November 1805 had been a complete failure with the rockets not even reaching the town. Musquito joined the expedition to Copenhagen in October 1806 where she was stationed in the Belt to prevent supplies reaching Zealand. In June 1807 Mosquito captured Jeune Adolphe, M. Combet, Master. Musquito shared in the prize money for the capture of Copenhagen on 7 September 1807. Musquito was recommissioned in October 1807 under Commander William Goate for the North Sea. She next appears in the records in early 1809. In late 1808 or early 1809, Musquito retrieved and brought into Heligoland George, Maddock, master, which had been sailing from London to Heligoland when she ran ashore nearly filled with water. Her crew had deserted her, and her cargo was much damaged.Lloyd's List, no.4329,, - accessed 16 May 2014. Musquito captured the Danish privateers Princess Juliana Sophia on 17 May 1809, and the cutter Sol Fulgen (or Soe Fulgen) of six guns and 24 men off Heligoland on 25 May 1809. Musquito may have been in command of the gun-vessel because on 30 May Lieutenant E.W. Mansel, of Patriot sent a letter to Goate for onward transmission announcing the capture of the Danish cutter privateer Snap. The capture took place in the River Hever. Snap was armed with three guns and had a crew of nine men. She was one week out of Tonningen, but had not captured anything. That same month Mansel advised Goate that Patriot had captured in the Jahde River a Dutch gun-vessel of one gun, some swivel guns, and 10 men, a Danish privateer of one gun, six swivels and 25 men, off Langerooz, and with the hired armed vessel , of the destruction of two French privateers and a sloop in the Jahde. Elbe In June 1809 Lord George Stuart gave Goate command of a small force consisting of Musquito, the two s and , five gun-brigs, including , and Patriot and Alert. On 7 July they entered the Elbe. There was a battery at Cuxhaven so they anchored out range of its cannons. Next morning at daylight Goate led a landing party but before they could attack the battery its 80-man garrison retreated, abandoning their guns. The British then loaded the battery‚Äôs six 24-pounders into vessels lying in the harbour, together with all the shot and military stores they could find and some other small guns. Next, they blew up the fort and seized two French gunboats, each of two guns. Lastly, the landing party handed the town of Cuxhaven back to the civil governor before returning to its vessels. Later, Mosquito, Basilisk and would share in the prize money. On 26 July French cavalry almost captured several British naval officers reconnoitering the village of Ritzbuttle. Lord Stuart responded by sending a detachment to meet the French. However, Stuart then discovered that the French had retreated to Gessendorf, which was some from Cuxhaven. He sent Goate and a landing party from Mosquito towards Gessendorf. As soon as Goate approached the French they evacuated Gessendorf in requisitioned wagons, while about 60 cavalry covered their retreat. At the same time Stuart had Pettet of Briseis take his men around the flank to capture a battery of four 12-pounders that was firing round shot and grape at Stuart and Captain Watts of Ephira. Before the British arrived, the French artillerymen abandoned their guns, making their escape via boats on the Weser. Still, the British captured the commander of the battery, together with three of his officers or non-commissioned officers. The British then burst the four 12-pounders before they took away the powder. The only British casualty on the entire expedition was Watts, who had been wounded. On 21 October Musquito was under the command of Commander Robert Petter and in company with the gun-brig when they captured the galliot Fortuna. On 30 October, Musquito and Richmond captured the Fortuna. Whether these are the same or different vessels is an open question. Cruising Musquito was recommissioned in June 1811 under Commander Christopher Bell. Early in September Primus, carrying tar and hemp, Worksam, in ballast, Experiment, carrying iron, Columbus, carrying linseed, Neptunus, carrying timber, and Hctor, carrying sundry goods, came into Yarmouth. They were prizes to , , , , Musquito, , and .Lloyd's List, no. 4596, - accessed 16 May 2014. In February 1812 Musquito came under the command of Commander James Tomkinson. On 1 June 1812 Musquito, which was shorthanded, intercepted a group of lobster boats off Heligoland. She then impressed two seamen from the boats. The men and their colleagues sued for their release, and in 1813 were granted a writ of habeas corpus. The argument was that because Britain had taken possession of the island and its fisheries in 1807, the Heligoland fisheries were British possessions and thus fell within a defined statutory exception for \\"the fisheries of this Kingdom\\".The law review and quarterly journal of British and foreign jurisprudence. (London: Owen Richards, 1845-1856), Vol. 13, pp.254-5. Between 29 July and 4 August, Musquito captured several Dutch fishing boats: Gute Verwagting, Tobie Maria, Jonge Maria, Jeannette, Femme Elizabeth, Hoop (alias Esperance), and the Rondwich. By agreement, Musquito shared the prize money with , , and Cretan. On 7 August 1812 Musquito was at Yarmouth, having captured three Dutch prizes off the Dogger Bank. These were Jonge Maria, Jonge Dirk, and Saloritta, all carrying saltfish.Lloyd's List, no.4692, - accessed 16 May 2014. On 11 February 1813, the schooner , with Musquito in company, recaptured the Neptune. On 24 April 1813 Musquito sailed for the Leeward Islands. On 11 February 1814, Musquito, still under Tomkinson's command, detained the American brig Halligren in the river of Surinam. Halligren was condemned under droit of admiralty and prize money was awarded. Then on 30 June Musquito captured the slaver Manuella, which was carrying a cargo of slaves. Manuella was sailing under Spanish colours and was on her way to Puerto Rico with \\"500 Negros\\" when Musquito captured her and sent her into Tortola.Lloyd's List, - accessed 16 May 2014. Perhaps because of the head money for the slaves, the prize money involved was quite substantial. On 6 July Musquito captured the ship Sophia. Post-war On 26 February 1815, Musquito was one of the warships that sailed from St. Thomas as escort to a convoy of 95 vessels bound for Great Britain.Lloyd's List, no.4959, - accessed 16 May 2014. On 26 June, Panther, Gezoline, master, arrived at Plymouth as a prize to , Musquito, , , and . She had been sailing from Martinique to Dunkirk when the British captured her.Lloyd's List, no.4984, - accessed 16 May 2014. On 9 July, Sophia, Westfolm, master, arrived at Plymouth. Musquito had detained Sophia as she was sailing from Drontheim to Rochelle.Lloyd's List, no.4987, - accessed 16 May 2014. A few days later Neptune, Horner, master, also arrived at Plymouth. Musquito had detained her as she was sailing from Holland to Rochelle.Lloyd's List, no.4989, - accessed 16 May 2014. On 12 August Commander George Brine was appointed to Musquito from and he took command on 25 August. She then spent several years off Africa, much of the time at St Helena, \\"guarding Napoleon\\". In August 1816 Musquito was at Port Louis, √éle de France. While cruising in the vicinity she captured a number of slave vessels, including the schooners Petite Aim√©e and Helen, and the luggers St. Joseph and Zephyr. The captures of Petite Aim√©e and St. Joseph occurred on 15 and 17 October 1816. The capture of Zephyr took place on 19 December. On 7 October 1817 Musquito arrived at the Cape of Good Hope from √éle de France. From there she sailed to Saint Helena. She was reported at St Helena on 12 April 1818 and again on 17 August. On 14 November she arrived at Deal from Portsmouth and sailed for the Thames. Brine received promotion to post-captain on 7 December 1818. Fate Musquito was paid off at Deptford in 1818. The Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy first offered the \\"Mosquito brig, of 18 guns and 384 tons\\", lying at Deptford, for sale on 13 April 1822.

As Amy had initially assumed Rory was gay due to his lack of interest in other women, a teenage Mels (Nina Toussaint-White) had been the one to inform Amy of Rory's affections. On 21st century Earth, Mels hijacks the TARDIS and directs it to 1938, where she is shot by Hitler (Albert Welling) and regenerates into River Song. They learn she is the assailant they saw kill the Doctor in his future. At the episode's conclusion, they decide to let the adult River make her own way in life and continue their travels. Rory features prominently in \\"The Girl Who Waited\\", where he is confronted with the horrible consequences time travel has had on a version of his wife. In \\"The God Complex\\", he is the only one of the TARDIS crew who is not hunted by the creature that feeds on faith because of Rory's rational nature and lack of personal faith. The Doctor eventually realises the danger he is exposing his friends to and returns Amy and Rory to Earth, giving them a house and a car as exit presents. The Doctor next glimpses the couple in \\"Closing Time\\", some time after he left them. The pair appear in his life once again when River creates an alternate reality by refusing to kill the Doctor. They witness the Doctor marry River in the alternate universe before returning to the established course of events where the Doctor once again appears to die. Once reality is restored, however, they are visited by their daughter River, who tells them the secret that the Doctor is still alive, and that the version of him that died had been a robot duplicate. Though he wishes the world to believe he is dead, the Doctor joins Rory and Amy two years in their future for Christmas dinner in the Christmas special \\"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\\". Series seven opener \\"Asylum of the Daleks\\" (2012) establishes early on that Amy and Rory are set to divorce. The Daleks kidnap the Doctor to go on a mission for them, as well as kidnapping Rory and Amy on the day they are about to sign their divorce papers because they know the Doctor works better with companions. During the mission, the Doctor engineers a reconciliation between the two. The two discuss their feelings for each other. It is revealed Amy left Rory because she has been infertile since \\"A Good Man Goes to War\\", and she knew he wanted children. The Doctor subsequently embarks on sporadic journeys with the Ponds. Rory is said to be 31 years old at the time of \\"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\\". They rejoin him as permanent companions prior to their last adventure in \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\". In this story, Rory is sent back to 1930s New York by a Weeping Angel, where he encounters River, and is tracked there by the Doctor and Amy, where he finds himself repeatedly the victim of Weeping Angels repeatedly attacking him and dislocating him in space and time. It is discovered he is in an Angel \\"battery farm\\", where they intend to trap him until he dies of old age. Rory even encounters his dying older self there. Amy and Rory jump from a building to create a paradox and destroy the Angels, but one survives and sends Rory back in time. Amy chooses to let it send her back in time as well, and due to the massive paradox the Doctor can never reunite with them. From a tombstone he learns that Rory died at age 82, and Amy at 87. The website-only epilogue \\"P.S.\\" later reveals that Rory and Amy adopted a son, in 1946, and named him Anthony Brian Williams. His middle name was chosen after Rory's father, Brian, to whom Rory sent a letter in \\"P.S.\\".Information on \\"P.S.\\" on Doctor Who website Literature Rory appears alongside the Doctor and Amy in numerous Doctor Who stories found in the New Series Adventures novels, the 2in1 series chapter books, the Quick Reads novels, and original audiobooks. Casting and characterisation For his audition, Arthur Darvill received two scenes from the first episode and one from the sixth, but beyond the fact Rory was Amy's boyfriend he was not informed of details of the character. Lead writer and executive producer Steven Moffat stated that what stood out about Darvill's audition was \\"just how funny\\" he was. Darvill felt \\"privileged\\" to be part of the show, and was pleased with Rory's storyline. Darvill had previously worked with Matt Smith on a play called Swimming with Sharks. He became a regular with \\"A Christmas Carol\\"; Darvill had his \\"fingers crossed\\" that he would become a regular. Rory was a character who was \\"completely in love\\" with Amy, but Amy had things to do in life before admitting she loved him too. Moffat described Rory as someone who had grown up in the \\"shadow\\" of Amy's imaginary Doctor. Rory became a nurse because of this. Rory eventually evolves into a \\"bumbling action hero\\". Speaking of Rory's characterisation in the first series, actor Darvill felt that he was \\"on the outside looking into this world he was desperately trying to save Amy from.\\" Executive producer Steven Moffat had intended to have a married couple on the TARDIS \\"from the off\\". Darvill stated of the couple's marriage that Amy will always \\"wear the trousers\\". However, he felt that Rory's marriage had stopped the character \\"feeling so unworthy.\\" In regards to how Rory changed between series five and six, Darvill stated that \\"his sense of adventure has awoken\\" and that he is more comfortable with himself. Reception Rory's frequent deaths in the programme have been subject to criticism. Digital Spy reviewer Morgan Jeffery wrote, \\"One of the key elements in Doctor Who is obviously the sense of danger and the lingering presence of death, but Rory's repeated demises and resurrections are now becoming so frequent that comparisons to South Park Kenny seem almost inevitable.\\" In a review for \\"The Doctor's Wife\\", Neela Debnath of The Independent announced that \\"Rory-gets-killed fatigue has now officially set in\\". On the other hand, SFX awarded Rory the third spot in the top 10 resurrections of science fiction TV, saying that \\"it's becoming a clich√©. But it's not one we mind too much, mainly because it's always done with such gusto. Except, perhaps, in the pirates episode which was a fairly gusto free zone all round\\". However, critics have celebrated the increased opportunities for Rory to be heroic in series 6. Following the airing of \\"A Good Man Goes to War\\", io9's Charlie Jane Anders compared the character to Wesley Wyndam-Pryce (Alexis Denisof), whose arc in the American television programmes Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel similarly saw him transition from laughable comic relief to a genuine warrior. Anders comments: \\"We're thrilled that Rory is getting his Wesley Wyndam-Pryce on. Badass Rory is, as we already observed, totally badass.\\" Sam McPherson of Zap2it believed that Rory had the most character development of the characters in the fifth series, evolving into a \\"generally enjoyable character\\". The Radio Times blog singled the character out for praise: \\"As a traveller in the Tardis, Rory probably speaks for the audience far more than past companions have. Sure, we all like to think we'd spring into action just like the Doctor. But in truth, if we joined an eccentric alien on a journey through time and space, we'd probably be more Rory than Rose.\\" However, in 2015 Michael Hogan of The Daily Telegraph criticised the general portrayal of male companion figures in Doctor Who. He described Rory, alongside 2005-2006 character Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and 2014 character Danny Pink (Samuel Anderson) as all \\"basically soppy, sappy, slightly annoying plus-ones to far superior females\\". Rory was named \\"TV Character of the Year\\" in the Virgin Media TV Awards in 2012. SFX named Amy and Rory the second-best science fiction and fantasy romance.

Shipmeadow has no shop or even a church because it was made redundant in 1980. Of the village's 140 population, 69 are male and 71 are female according to the 2011 Census. Norwich is located approximately 14.9 miles (24.1 km) NW of Shipmeadow as the crow flies and Great Yarmouth is located 13.7 miles (22.1 km) NE of the village. The River Waveney runs to the North of the village and feeds into the River Yare to the East. 'The White house' and the River Waveney define the North and Western boundaries of the settlement while the boundary to the South is the area between Shipmeadow Common and Hawthorne Farm.  History  Shipmeadow is recorded in the domesday book as Scitmetdua or Scipmedu. This settlement appears on the John Speed's 1610 map as Shepemeadow. This shows that the name has more likely to be sheep meadow rather than the current Shipmeadow. In the 1870s, John Marius Wilson made the following notes about Shipmeadow: > 'Shipmeadow, a parish, with a village, in Wangford district, Suffolk; 2¬Ω > miles W by S of Beccles r. station. It has a post-office under Beccles. The > church was repaired in 1856. The Wangford workhouse is here, has > accommodation for about 400 inmates.' The workhouse remains, but has since been converted to residential use.The Workhouse in Wangford The Workhouse website  Industry  Historically, Shipmeadow's primary industry has been agriculture due to its rural location. During 1881 the three most popular occupations were Agriculture with 31 workers, Domestic Services with 29 workers and textile services with 7 workers. According to the 2011 Census, the top three industries in Shipmeadow were Human Health and Social Work with 14 workers, Wholesale and retail trade with 11 workers and Agriculture with 6 workers.This graph shows the occupations of Shipmeadow in 1881  Transport  Population of Shipmeadow based on Census dataThe B1062 road runs through Shipmeadow, linking it to Beccles to the East and Bungay to the West. The A143 and A146 run to the North of the village and provide a route to Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft. The nearest train station to the Village is located within Beccles about 3.5 Miles away.

He was killed in action during World War I. Military career Bradford was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and was commissioned into the Seaforth Highlanders as a second lieutenant on 22 August 1888. He was promoted to lieutenant on 11 June 1890, and to captain on 3 July 1895. In 1897 he served in the occupation of Crete. The following year he took part in the Soudan campaign under Sir Herbert Kitchener, where he was present at the Battles of Atbara and Khartoum, for which he was mentioned in despatches and received the Queen's Sudan Medal and the Khedive's Sudan Medal with two clasps.Hart's Army list, 1903 He was next Aide-de-camp to Sir Francis Grenfell, Governor of Malta. In January 1900 he was transferred back as a regular captain in the 2nd battalion of his regiment, and early the following month embarked the SS Canada leaving Southampton for South Africa, where the battalion was to serve in the Second Boer War. He was appointed to the staff as Deputy-Assistant Adjutant-General on 3 January 1902, and received a brevet promotion as major in the South African Honours list published on 26 June 1902, with a note for future staff employment. The war ended that month, and Bradford returned to the United Kingdom on the SS Syria two months later, arriving in Southampton in early September 1902, when he joined the 1st battalion of his regiment. Bradford was killed in action during the First Battle of the Aisne of the First World War by shrapnel from a shell impact near Bucy-le-Long in Picardy on 14 September 1914, whilst commanding the 2nd Battalion of his Regiment. He is buried in Crouy-Vauxrot French National Cemetery. Cricket career Bradford was a right-handed batsman who was a right-arm fast bowler. Bradford's playing role was that of an all-rounder. Bradford made his first-class debut for Hampshire in the 1895 County Championship against Somerset. During the 1896 County Championship Bradford represented the club three times, taking his maiden five wicket haul against Essex, finishing with figures of 6/28 in Essex's first innings as Essex were bowled out for only 98. Essex were made to follow on in their second innings, with Bradford repeating his feat of taking a five wicket haul in the first innings by taking 5/40 as Hampshire won by an innings and 113 runs. Bradford next played in 1899 against the touring Australians, where he took the wicket of Frank Iredale, who was his only wicket in the match. Later in 1899 Bradford made his maiden first-class century, scoring 102 against Leicestershire. Bradford's final first-class match came for Hampshire in 1905 against Surrey, where he made a half century score of 60. In Bradford's eight first-class matches he took 311 wickets at an average of 25.91. With the ball Bradford took 20 wickets at a bowling average of 16.40, with figures of 6-28. In the field Bradford took five catches. During his brief career, Bradford's bowling action was not approved by several first-class umpires, being no-balled on numerous occasions.

Its founder, in 1959 as Clarksons Tours, a subsidiary of the long-established City firm of H. Clarkson shipbrokers, was Tom Gullick, a former flag lieutenant in the Royal Navy. The company was immensely successful but ran into financial difficulties and in 1972 was taken over by its major supplier of air travel, Court Line. However, after two years, on 15 August 1974, Court Line collapsed, taking down Clarksons with at least ¬£7m owing to 100,000 holidaymakers and possibly twice as much. Services The company was based appropriately in Sun Street, EC2 in the City of London. It specialised in short tours to European cities and wine regions, and low-cost package holidays which included accommodation, full or half-board and air transport by charter flight from the UK to the holiday destination. Destinations included Spain, Portugal, Italy, Yugoslavia and Greece as well as Mediterranean cruises and a wide range of short tours to European cities and wine regions. A typical example was ¬£50 with full-board in Palma, Majorca for 14 nights. Flights also were made to Tunisia and other destinations. In 1972 the company introduced package holidays to Court Line- owned hotels on the Caribbean island of St Lucia, using wide-bodied Court Line Lockheed L-1011 TriStar aircraft, the first to operate in Europe. Always a pioneer, Clarksons installed the very first real-time computer system in the western hemisphere, which handled bookings, flights, and hotels all in one. The system was a UNIVAC 96K 9400 card-reading real-time computer, with a complete terminal using a teletype-like data entry point with hexadecimal data entered by pressing numerous buttons illuminated on the main board. There were 6 magnetic tape machines, two magnetic disk drives (each 10 megabytes with six heavy metal disks for each machine), and a high-speed line printer (capable of printing charter airline tickets at a rate of about one every three seconds on multi-part paper). The basement computer room was maintained at and 65% humidity, and operated 7 days per week, 52 weeks per year. Air travel Clarksons had an air terminal at 202‚Äì204 Finchley Road, London, NW3, close to the junction with Frognal Lane. This was used for coach transport to Luton Airport, the main airport served by Court Line, which was Clarksons' main air transport supplier. Court Line eventually had to step in and bail out the company when it went into financial difficulties as it was their largest customer. Flight International magazine estimated that in the five years before the collapse, eight million holidays had each averaged ¬£1 below cost. Flight International stated that the marketing of airline seats with Mediterranean hotels had given millions of ordinary people holidays once available only to the privileged and that the collapse was: \\"the inevitable consequence of continuing to see ¬£25 flights for ¬£20 and less\\". This was compounded by high inflation, a sinking pound, doubled fuel prices and coups in Portugal, Cyprus and Greece. On top of that was the three-day week in the key booking period. A takeover of their competitor, bankrupt Horizon Holidays, by Court Line failed to improve the financial situation. Flight International added that the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), headed at the time by Lord Boyd-Carpenter, must bear some responsibility for CourtLine's and Clarksons' collapse and asked questions such as how interlocking companies were related. It also stated that the information should be public, as in the United States, and criticised Peter Shore, the Secretary of State for Trade at the time, for continuing the government policy of secrecy, financial unprofessionalism and hiding behind the Civil Aviation Act of 1971. Political repercussions Clarksons held an Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (ATOL) licence and were therefore theoretically covered by their insurance bond. Unfortunately, although the 35,000 passengers stranded abroad were repatriated, there was insufficient funds for the 100,000 whose holidays had been paid in advance.Civil Aviation Authority History of ATOL Civil Aviation Authority Tours and Travel Arrangement The Trade Minister, at the time, Tony Benn assured customers that none would lose money as a result of the collapse, perhaps mindful that a second General Election in 1974 was likely, as indeed it turned out. All eventually had their money returned. Accidents On Friday evening, 3 July 1970, a Clarksons chartered Dan Air de Havilland Comet, registration G-APDN, en route from Manchester to Barcelona deviated from the intended course and crashed into high ground at the Montseny Massif, Girona, in northern Spain. The aircraft was destroyed by impact and subsequent ground fire. There were three flight crew, four cabin crew and 105 passengers aboard. All suffered fatal injuries. It was Dan Air's first fatal accident with fare- paying passengers. The Dan Air G-APDN Air Crash Memorial is in Padiham, Lancashire.

The film is based on the 1882 novel Mr. Isaacs written by Francis Marion Crawford. Plot Karim is the son of rajah and jewel merchant Hamid, traveling with him through India. On the twentieth day of their journey, after Karim hears his father speak about the importance of gratitude, they are attacked by bandits. The group of travelers is massacred, but Rao Rama, a holy man, hides Karim in a shallow grave. He survives the tragedy, and is left with his father's most valuable diamond. Karim next journeys to Bombay, where he attempts to sell the diamond in a jewelry store. Feeling that they aren't offering him enough money, he leaves. The corrupt store owners claim that Karim is a thief. He is arrested, and unable to prove he is the true owner of his father's diamond, faces a long prison sentence. William Darsey, an American witness, saves him by revealing the truth and Karim is released. Some time later, Karim becomes one of the wealthiest men of Bombay, attending many high society social functions. At a polo match, he meets Janice Darsey, an attractive young American woman accompanied by her aunt and Dr. Wallace. Feeling attracted to each other, they are soon in love. This is much to Mrs. Darsey's dislike, who doesn't approve of her niece dating an Indian man. She attempts to sabotage their relationship by announcing that the Darseys will leave for Kolkota. Janice, however, does not want to leave Karim and runs away from her aunt to secretly accompany Karim on a tiger hunt. When her aunt finds out, she is infuriated and immediately calls for William, who happens to be Janice's brother. During the hunt, Karim notices his father's killer. When confronted, the murderer shoots at Karim. Janice starts to hide and stumbles upon a poisonous plant. Karim brings her to safety and removes the poison, after which they become engaged. Back at home, William and Mrs. Darsey try to stop the marriage by telling them lies, but Karim and Janice come to the conclusion that their love for each other is stronger.

He feared the cost would fall on the next generation or even the generation afterwards. Public anger was justified as banks had made loans which could never be repaid and these loans were sold on around the world creating the subprime mortgage crisis. The banks still had undeclared risky assets. In the meantime, bankers pay, which in 1980 was comparable with a doctor or lawyer, had risen by 2006 to four times that value and Haldane said it needs to fall to that of other professions.

History  Producer Ken Nelson set up recording sessions in August 1958 to record enough tracks for two albums. The first was to become Country Love Ballads, the second the gospel music for Satan is Real. Over 20 songs were recorded in a seven-day span. The 3-minute title-track, with only two sung choruses, is largely taken up by a personal narrative monologue describing the dangers of Satan. Cover Designed by Ira Louvin, the cover features the brothers standing in a rock quarry, dressed in matching spotless white suits and black ties, in front of a plywood rendition of the Devil, as several hidden tires soaked in kerosene burn behind them as fire and brimstone. Reception While reviewers have generally commented on the distinctive album cover, they have also highly praised the song writing and performances. Mark Deming stated in his AllMusic review: \\"You don't need to share the Louvin Brothers' spiritual beliefs to be moved by the grace, beauty and lack of pretension of this music; Satan Is Real is music crafted by true believers sharing their faith, and its power goes beyond Christian doctrine into something at once deeply personal and truly universal, and the result is the Louvin Brothers' masterpiece.\\" Don Yates of No Depression called the album a \\"bold statement of its title signified the uncompromising nature of the Louvins‚Äô beliefs. Whereas much country gospel of the ‚Äô50s was filled with feel-good platitudes that reflected the general optimism of the time, the Louvins‚Äô gospel songs mirrored their own fire-and-brimstone Christianity... the album is an essential document of a side of the Louvins‚Äô music that was at least as important to them as their more famous secular recordings.\\" Critic Scott Walden compared the Louvins' music to the Velvet Underground; \\"Their comprehension of the tortured throes of a drunkard's Satan-infested soul are no less profound than Lou Reed's own understanding of a heroin junkie wrestling with a world devoid of meaning beyond the piercing tip of the needle... The depth is there in Satan is Real. This album transcends the immediate kitsch appeal of its cover. There is a reason why songs from this album have been performed by the more commonly accepted genius of artists such as Gram Parsons, Johnny Cash, and Emmylou Harris.\\" Cultural legacy \\"The Christian Life\\" was covered by The Byrds on their 1968 country rock album Sweetheart of the Rodeo. \\"Satan's Jeweled Crown\\" was covered by Emmylou Harris on her 1975 album Elite Hotel. The opening bars of the album's title track \\"Satan is Real\\" can be heard at the beginning of Hank Williams III's \\"Medley: Straight to Hell / Satan is Real\\", on his Straight to Hell album of 2006. It is also excerpted in Will Ferrell's 2009 one-man Broadway show You're Welcome America. A Final Night With George W Bush.

North‚Äìsouth faulting is in part responsible for elevating harder-wearing strata above the general level of the Cheshire Plain. Typically the higher summits are formed from the Helsby Sandstone. The ridge acted as something of a barrier to the passage of Irish Sea ice during the last ice age and its hills are etched with numerous glacial meltwater channels, many of which formed subglacially. Particularly spectacular examples are those at Urchin's Kitchen in Primrosehill Woods and at Holbitch Slack near Cotebrook.British Geological Survey 1:50K map sheets 97, 109, 122 Hill forts A series of Iron Age hill forts adorn the ridge from Woodhouse Hill and Helsby Hill in the north through Eddisbury and Kelsborrow Castle to Maiden Castle in the south. Recreation The ridge is traversed by the popular Sandstone Trail, a middle-distance recreational route originally established by the former Cheshire County Council between Beacon Hill and Grindley Brook on the Shropshire border but now extended into Frodsham to the north and Whitchurch to the south. Sections of the Delamere Way, Longster Trail and Eddisbury Way also explore parts of the ridge. Numerous of the woods along the ridge have been used for orienteering competitions over the years.

He has written and directed and documentary films that challenge the status quo on such issues as class conflict, torture, the prison system, and the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. In 1993, Loevy was awarded the Israel Prize in Communication, Radio and Television in 1993 for his life's work. Loevy is Professor Emeritus of Cinema and Television at Tel Aviv University. Biography Ram Loevy was the son of Theodor Loevy, a journalist and his wife Elisa, originally from Poland. His father was the editor of the Danziger Echo, a prominent Jewish newspaper in the Free City of Danzig, who had been jailed for publishing anti-Nazi articles in his paper. Upon his release he fled to Poland, but that country later expelled him in the months leading up to World War II, under pressure from the authorities in Nazi Germany. He and his wife arrived in Palestine just three months before Ram Loevy was born.Penny Starr, \\"ITV pioneer Ram Loevy still searching for reel truth\\", in the \\"Focus\\" section of the Jerusalem Post, April 2‚Äì8, 1993. Loevy grew up in Tel Aviv, where he attended the Carmel School and Municipal High School A. As a boy, he was active in the Scouts and in the paramilitary Gadna program, in which high school age boys and girls undergo paramilitary training in preparation for military service. It was in the Scouts that he met his wife Zipora. Upon being drafted to the Israel Defense Forces, he served in a Nahal unit that combined military training with agricultural work on a kibbutz. He was sent to Kibbutz Gal'ed in northern Israel, near the large Israeli Arab town of Umm al-Fahm. He later worked on Kibbutz Sde Boker in the Negev. Upon completing his military service, Loevy majored in Economics and Political Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. At the same time, he dabbled in theater by participating in student productions, and worked at the national Voice of Israel radio station as a program editor, actor, producer, director, and skit-writer.. In 1967, upon completing his degree, he traveled to London to attend the London Film School (then known as the London School of Film Technique). Loevy's stay in London was cut short by the Six-Day War. Loevy returned to Israel to serve in the army. Soon after the war, he returned to London to continue his studies and worked as an assistant director at Elstree Studios for the British espionage/science fiction adventure series The Champions. At the same time, he was also an announcer for the BBC's Hebrew- language department. Media career Loevy made his first foray into film as the assistant director for a documentary film, Sand Screen by Baruch Dinar, with American journalist Drew Pearson. This was immediately followed by work on the documentary I Ahmad (1966), directed by Avshalom Katz, for which he served as the executive producer and co-screenwriter. The film told the story of an Arab laborer's journey from the Triangle to Tel Aviv. In 1968, while in London, Loevy proposed to create a documentary film about the many rifts in Israeli society. Though the BBC expressed interest in the project, Loevy abandoned it in order to return to Israel and help the Israel Broadcasting Authority launch the country's first attempt at television broadcasting, Channel 1,Gil Sadan, \\"Mourning on Both Sides of the Barricade\\", in Yediot Ahronot, 1 August 1972. which began broadcasting on 2 May 1968. In addition to his work on the new channel's weekly shows, he also directed a number of documentary films for it:All basic information about Loevy's films is derived from his Curriculum Vitae in this author's possession, and abridged version of which can be found here . Additional information has been annotated. Note that in some instances, the dates given in the CV refer to the production, whereas the dates given here refer to the screening dates. * Barricades (1969), which examined the Arab-Israel conflict from the perspective of two families, one Jewish and one Palestinian. * Israel in the '80s, (2 films, 1971), speculating on the future of Israeli education. * Don't Think Twice, (1972), about preparations by the Habima Theatre for a new stage production by Nisim Aloni. The film was nominated for the prestigious Prix Italia for Radio and Television. * Time Out (1975), on encounters between young Arabs and Jews. Already in these early works, Loevy focused on two themes that would dominate his laterprojects: the tense relationship between Arabs and Jews in Israel, and the role of education and art in shaping a society. His next documentary would introduce another key theme: the inequities of class disparity and discrimination between Jews and Arabs in Israel, and between Jewish Israelis. * Second Generation Poor, (1976), was a two-part series that offered a chilling look at the effects of poverty in Israel. In 1971, he directed seven short films based on the poetry of Yiddish writer Kadya Moldovsky. First features for television These films can be divided into two groups: two films released in 1972, and two released in 1975. They are: * Rose Water from Port Said (1972), based on a story by Gideon Talpaz, tells of a landlady who runs a boarding house in Jerusalem at the time of the British Mandate. One day, she receives a Black slave from the Sudan as a gift. Though the film was set in the relatively distant past, in 1932, this first attempt at drama already hints at two of the major themes that appear throughout Loevy's later work: class distinctions and ethnic differences. * The Fifth Hand, also from 1972, breaks from the serious nature of Loevy's themes to tell the story of a group of people addicted to the game of bridge. Nevertheless, his insights into the role that leisure activities play in people's lives would be echoed over thirty years later in one of his most riveting documentaries, Sakhnin, My Life, about the Bnei Sakhnin football club from the Arab town of Sakhnin. * The Bride and the Butterfly Hunter (1974) is a quirky, surrealistic film version of a play by Nisim Aloni about a bride who flees her wedding and a clerk who flees his humdrum existence by escaping to the park every Wednesday afternoon to hunt‚Äîand release‚Äîbutterflies. The encounter between the two takes place in a park, where political propaganda is broadcast over a loudspeaker system. Though this is not integral to the story, it indicates that even in the most whimsical encounters it is impossible to escape the overbearing presence of political forces exploiting the conflicts in Israel for their own advantage. This film was selected to represent Israel at the Prix Italia. * Stella (1975) is a love story about an affair between a piano teacher and a messenger boy. It was also selected to represent Israel at the Prix Italia. Khirbet Khize Khirbet Khize cast: Amos Tal Shir, Itzik Aloni, Dalik Volonitz, Gidi Gov, Avi Luzia, Shraga Harpaz, and Avraham Sidi In 1978, Loevy was propelled into the spotlight for his dramatization of the novella Khirbet Khize (◊ó◊®◊ë◊™ ◊ó◊ô◊ñ◊¢◊î) by S. Yizhar. The story, written in May 1949, tells of how Israeli soldiers expelled the Palestinian inhabitants of the fictional village of Khirbet Khize from their homes toward the end of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Though controversial, the story was well-known, and had been incorporated into the Israeli curriculum. S. Yizhar was a highly respected author, a recipient of the Israel Prize, and served in the Knesset from 1949 to 1967. Loevy first proposed the dramatization of the story in 1972, but was rejected by the Israel Broadcasting Authority. He submitted the proposal again in 1977, this time with a script by Daniella Carmi, hoping that the film would be used to mark Israel's 30th Independence Day. This time the film was approved, and he was given a budget of 700,000 Israeli liras, an enormous sum at the time. He filmed in the West Bank and completed the film in August of that year. There was some debate over whether the film should be screened because of its controversial nature, but after a screening before the board of the IBA, it was decided to go ahead. In 1977, while the film was being produced, a new government headed by Menachem Begin was voted into power, Anwar Sadat visited Jerusalem, and people from across the political spectrum began to question whether it should be screened, given the sensitivity of potential peace negotiations. Khirbet Khize was originally planned to be aired on 16 January 1978, but on that day the joint Israeli-Egyptian Political Committee first met in Jerusalem, and it was deemed inappropriate. When the talks broke down in February, it was decided to screen the film in the context of a political talk show to enable a public debate. A decision was made to reconvene the IBA board to make a final decision, as two members were opposed, but in the end, Minister of Education Zevulon Hammer stepped in and blocked the film from being aired at all. This prompted a bitter debate in Israel, with Knesset member Yossi Sarid of the Labor Party declaring that \\"Freedom of expression in Israel has been brought to half mast!\\".Amos Carmel, \\"Khirbet Khize: \\"A Festival of Demagoguery\\", in the Davar newspaper, 10 February 1978 Some reports even claimed that Begin himself was stunned that the film was being censored.Gideon Alon, \\"Begin Expresses His Surprise over the Minister's Decision to Delay the Screening of Khirbet Khize\\", in the Haaretz newspaper, 8 February 1978. In protest at the ministerial decision, IBA employees decided to black out the broadcast for 48 minutes during the night that Khirbet Khize was to be screened (February 6, 1978) to protest the IBA's decision to allow the government to intervene in television broadcasting. The next week, the Board of the IBA decided to screen the film. It aired on 13 February 1978, and Ram Loevy earned the reputation of an iconoclast who was willing and able to fight a deeply politicized system. This was a turning point in his career, and his later films continued to challenge the established mythology of modern Israel.Most of the information about the Hirbet Hiza'aa incident is described by Anita Shapira in Alpayim, a leading Israeli literary journal, vol. 21, 2000. Loevy then made two documentary films about the theatre and its role in society. It was a theme he had addressed in Don't Think Twice, but these films highlighted the role he believed theatre plays in the political discourse. * Playing Devils, Playing Angels (1979) followed a Haifa theatre troupe to the development town of Kiryat Shmona on the tense northern border with Lebanon. The border town had been the site of a massacre of eighteen people (including nine children) in 1974, and had long been the target of Katyusha rocket attacks from across the border. What distinguished this film however, was its depiction of the encounter between volunteers from the relatively affluent cities and what became known as the \\"Second Israel\\": impoverished Mizrahi Jews of Middle Eastern and North African descent. Attitudes toward this underclass would emerge as a major theme in Loevy's work. The nationalist aria \\"Va, pensiero!, sung by Hebrew slaves in Verdi's Nabucco, was a highlight of the performance in Caesarea. * Nebuchadnezzar in Caesarea (1980), about a performance of Giuseppe Verdi's opera Nabucco by the Deutsche Oper Berlin at the ancient Roman amphitheatre in Caesarea. The opera tells the story of Nebuchadnezzar, who destroyed the biblical Kingdom of Judah. It was performed in a theatre built by the Romans, who destroyed Judah's successor state, the Hasmonean kingdom of Judea, by the successor generation of Nazi Germany, which perpetrated the Holocaust against the Jewish people, successors of Judah and Judea, in their own, newly established homeland. The nationalist aria \\"Va, pensiero!\\"Modern History Sourcebook: Liberal Nationalism‚Äîa highlight of the opera‚Äîhad especial significance for the audience. The line O mia patria, si bella e perduta (\\"O my country, so lovely and so lost\\"), sung by Jewish exiles, particularly resonated with the audience. In another poignant scene, the opera's German producer apologized to a group of Jewish extras for asking them to play Babylonians, while German performers played persecuted Jews.Philip Gillon, \\"Remarkable\\", in the Jerusalem Post, 4 July 1980. * Indian in the Sun (1981) was based on a short story by Israeli journalist and author Adam Baruch, with a script by Dita Guery (with Micha Levtov and Ram Loevy). In Playing Devils, Playing Angels, Loevy examined the relationship between affluent, urban Israelis and the \\"Second Israel\\" as a documentarian. In this film, he dramatized the conflicts and similarities between the two groups. The story revolves around Laufer (played by Doron Nesher), an Israeli soldier from the wealthy suburbs of northern Tel Aviv, who is ordered to accompany another soldier, known only as \\"the Indian (played by Haim Gerafi)\\", to prison. \\"The Indian\\" was a dark-skinned Cochin Jew and a moshavnik (though Gerafi himself was an Ethiopian Jew), and the film highlights the patronizing attitude that Laufer has to his charge. Over time, however, and as the driver (played by Moshe Ivgy) watches, the two realize that they share a common enemy in the Establishment, and Laufer even offers to help the Indian escape. All the while, the driver watches in trepidation as two extremes of the Israeli social spectrum find that they have more in common than they thought, and begin to forge an alliance between them. The film won the Harp of David Award for the best Israeli television production of the year, as well as the Israeli Broadcasting Authority Award. Loevy spent 1983 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He had more than anyone shaped the direction of Israeli television as a medium addressing the country's major social issues, and for this he was awarded a Nieman Fellowship by Harvard University.Nieman Fellowship, Class of 1982 Among the other fellows with whom he studies was Alex Jones, winner of the 1987 Pulitzer Prize. During his year in Harvard, he studied what he called \\"epic television\\", and wrote about how a single night of watching American television‚Äî(Family Business, the news, and The Love Boat, plus commercials) could be compared to a three-act drama by Bertolt Brecht. He bemoaned the idea of a politically neutral medium of television, and concluded \\"Television was almost never neutral. On the rare occasions when it took a stand, (McCarthy, the Vietnam War, Watergate), it helped bring a significant change.\\"The article, which appears in the 1982 Nieman Reports, closes with a quote by Brecht from his Uber Experimentalles Theatre: \\"How can the unfree, ignorant man of our century, even with his thirst for freedom and his hunger for knowledge; how can the tortured and heroic, abused and ingenious, changeable and world-change man of this great and ghastly century, obtain his own theatre which will help him master the world and himself?\\" Upon returning to Israel, Loevy made a series of four documentary films for Israel TV, PBS, and England's Channel 4: * The End of the Bathing Season (1983, for Israel TV), about the present, as seen by archeologists of the future. * The Buck Stops in Brazil (1983, for PBS), about Brazil's national debt. * Between the River and the Sea (1984, Channel 4) about Rafik Halabi, then a Druze television correspondent in Israel. * The Million Dollar Scan (1985, PBS/Israel TV coproduction), about the Israeli company Elscint and its magnetic resonance imaging equipment. In 1972 Elscint was the first Israeli company to have an initial public offering on NASDAQ, but in the 1980s, the company suffered a series of severe financial losses that required a government bailout.Elscint, Ltd.‚ÄîCompany History. At the same time, he was preparing to embark on the project for which he is best known today, a drama about the Second Israel that would shake the country to its core. Bread (Lehem) A few years before Loevy left for Harvard, Israel Television commissioned two young scriptwriters, Gilad Evron and Meir Doron, to write a story about the \\"Second Israel.\\" Loevy had begun to explore this topic in his earlier works such as Indian in the Sun, and when he returned to Israel, he was presented with the first draft of their script. He and the writers spent two years rewriting the script and visiting the development towns of Yeruham, Dimona, and Sderot to meet with the local residents whose stories they wanted to tell,Rachel Neeman, \\"Khirbet Emaliah\\", in the magazine Koteret Rashit (Headlines), 1986. and producing sixteen more drafts until the story was finalized. In an interview, Loevy later explained the significance of these encounters to him: > The gap between rich and poor is enormous in a country that was once the > most egalitarian nation in the world. In the youth movements, Zionism was > seen as the Jewish way of achieving social justice that would encompass the > whole world. That ideal has been shattered. Now we have the pretension of > being an open and attentive socialist welfare state, but in fact, that > message only comes from a single direction. The system only responds to > those who shout. Those who are silent remain on the outside. The basic human > element has disappeared from the system. Loevy was determined to tell the story of the silenced masses, and he was determined to do it not by shouting but by silence. At a 2006 retrospective of his work, Loevy was introduced as an artist who \\"creates a silent scream in a soft but overwhelming voice.\\"Introductory remarks by Aner Preminger at the opening event of the Ram Loevy Retrospective, held at the Jerusalem Cinematheque, 3 January 2006. Cited in the magazine Cinemateque, vol. 142, September‚ÄìOctober 2006. The result was his film Bread (◊ú◊ó◊ù). The film tells the story of a Job-like character, Shlomo Elmaliach (played by Rami Danon), who loses his job at his town's local bakery when it is forced to close. Rather than join the other unemployed protesters, Elmaliach locks himself in his home and launches a very personal hunger strike. At first people come to visit him at home, and there's even a rumor that television reporters might show up (quickly dismissed by Elmaliach's friend Zaguri, \\"They only come when there's a ruckus.\\") Gradually, even Elmaliach's friends abandon him, and he ends up dragging his family down with him. A son (played by Moshe Ivgy) seeks radical solutions to poverty, a daughter (played by Etti Ankri) who escaped to Tel Aviv to study returns home and takes a job on a production line, and Elmaliach's wife (played by Rivka Bechar) takes a job as a seamstress. At the end of the film, the factory is reopened as a result of all the protests, but by then it is too late for Shlomo Elmaliach. When Bread was aired in 1986, unemployment was skyrocketing in Israel after a period of relative affluence, and even the Israel Broadcasting Authority had just fired all of its contractors.Tzippora Roman, \\"There's Bread\\", in LaIsha, 1986. The social impact was of the film was felt throughout the country, with one critic calling it a \\"punch in the stomach.\\"Meir Schnitzer, \\"The Death of the Little God\\", in HaIr, 1986. That year it was awarded the Prix Italia for television fiction. According to the prize's jury: > Bread is more than the story of a family on the fringes of the Israeli > society. It is a commentary on the universal problems of unemployment, > pride, stress, and the nature of human life.Jury of the Prix Italia, 1986. Loevy examined the role of music and film in society in two documentary films: * Voice of the Multitude (1987) looked at the role that popular choirs had played in defining the national soundtrack. * In the Seventh Sky (1991), more properly described as a training film, produced for Israel's Ministry of Education and Culture, offered a glimpse into how films are created by combining methods, tools, and human emotions to create an illusion of reality. Rather than tackle literature the same way, Loevy chose instead to adapt major literary works to the medium of television. In each of these, the works themselves tackled major issues facing Israeli society. In these cases, Loevy saw himself as a conduit by which he could bring the work of leading Israeli authors and playwrights and the issues they tackled to a broader public. * Winter Games (1988) was based on a story by Yitzhak Ben-Ner, adapted to the screen by Dita Guery (together with Meir Doron, Gilad Evron, and Ram Loevy, who had earlier collaborated on Bread). Ostensibly the story of the Jewish underground movement fighting against the British in Mandatory Palestine as seen from the perspective of a young boy, it is also a classic Bildungsroman about a boy transitioning into manhood with all the responsibilities that this entails. At the same time, however, it can also be seen as a metaphor for the State of Israel and its transition from youthful idealism of its founders' generation to the recognition of the stark realities facing a nation in its forties. * Crowned (1989) tackles a similar theme, but from the perspective of the founding fathers. The film, based on a play by author Yaakov Shabtai (adapted by Ephraim Sidon and Ram Loevy), is an intense comedy based on the final days of the biblical King David. As his life approaches its end, he faces the most difficult task of his forty-year reign‚Äîgiving up his crown to the next generation. Or perhaps he might even find a way to keep the crown for himself. The fact that this film was aired when Israel was itself forty years old was not lost on its audience. * Butsche (1992), based on a play by Yosef Bar-Yosef (script by Gilad Evron) tackles the religious divide within Israeli society in much the same way that Bread tackled the socio-economic divide. It is the story of an ultra-Orthodox man who returns home to his family in the Mea Shearim neighborhood of Jerusalem after being expelled by his father twelve years earlier for committing adultery. A reviewer wrote of the film that \\"Levy undermines what the secular think they know about the haredim, what haredim perhaps think they know about the secular....\\"Ronie Parciack, \\"Breaking Boundaries\\" in the Jerusalem Post, January 1992. One final film in this period was an original work scripted by Daniella Carmi. The Woman Who Stopped Eating (1991) is the story of a troubled scriptwriter who wants to write a feature film about a woman who stops eating. She turns to a film director who is also going through a crisis in his life, and together they begin to weave a story about this imaginary woman. The tension soon erupts, however, because the screenwriter wants to keep her story in the realm of the imaginary, while the director struggles to adopt a more realistic approach to the storyline. In some way, the story reflected the tensions marking Loevy's own career as both a documentarian and a dramatist.In his CV, in this author's possession, Loevy himself describes the film as \\"a story of self-castration. Israel Prize In 1993, when Loevy was at work on a documentary, he received the news that he had been awarded the Israel Prize for his lifework. It was the most prestigious honor that the Israeli government awards to its citizens, given annually to people from a wide range of fields who have made a significant contribution to Israeli culture, the sciences, or the country in general. It was only the second time that the prize was awarded to an individual for his contributions to television (the other was Moti Kirschenbaum), though in 1985, the country's Arabic-language television broadcasts also received the award. According to the jury that awarded the prize, > \\"On the one hand, a prominent feature of his work in film is the desire to > bring to a wider public of viewers an inner understanding and empathy for > the way of life, the outlook on the world, and the motives that govern the > actions of those known as \\"the fringe of society\\"‚Äîthe homeless, the > inhabitants of development towns, the Arabs, and the ultra-Orthodox.From the > citation explaining why the judges awarded Loevy the Israel Prize. Loevy (left) at a symposium in Tel Aviv University at which he delivered a talk on The Film that Wasn't. The newspaper Yediot Ahronot reported that, \\"Israel Prize Winner Making Film about the Secret Service's 'Torture Chambers.'\\"\\"The Film That Wasn't\\" in Wikisource contains a full account of the incident as described by Loevy in a speech at Tel Aviv University, 11 February 2009. Loevy's project, The Film that Wasn't, was a two-part documentary on interrogation methods in Israel, both within the Green Line (Episode 1) and in the Occupied Territories (Episode 2). In 1987, an official commission headed by the former President of the Supreme Court Moshe Landau ruled that \\"moderate physical pressure\\" might sometimes be necessary as an interrogation tool. What the second episode really investigated was what was being defined as \\"moderate physical pressure.\\" The two episodes were scheduled to be aired one week apart in October‚ÄìNovember 1993. While the first episode aired as planned, Kirschenbaum, then Director-General of the Israel Broadcasting Authority, was reluctant to screen the second episode until all three groups that interrogated prisoners‚Äîthe police, the Shin Bet, and the military‚Äîresponded to the allegations against them. Both the police and the Shin Bet did, but the IDF refused to respond to the charges of an anonymous young reservist, who claimed on camera to have been involved in the physical and mental abuse of prisoners. Even when it finally agreed to respond, it refused to ensure that the whistleblower's anonymity would be protected. The second episode finally aired almost eight months after the first, on 14 June 2004. Some people claimed that Loevy should have been denied the Israel Prize. Others came to his defense, with one critic writing: \\"The Israeli establishment had no choice but to embrace Loevy and grant him the Israel Prize in 1993, but even this did not succeed in silencing his penetrating voice and lightening his uncompromising perspective on Israeli society.\\"Cinemateque, vol. 142, September‚ÄìOctober 2006. This view was also echoed in the citation of the jury explaining why it selected Loevy: > \\"Equally worthy of special mention is his persistent struggle to show themes > regarded as 'unacceptable,' though they touch on fundamental truths about > Israeli society.... Given this context, his work is marked by boldness and > at the same time a great sense of responsibility. Two films that he made > [Barricades and Khirbet Khize] had their first television screening > delayed.... In his struggle to bring these films before the viewer despite > the fact that they treated controversial topics‚Äîa struggle which more than > once led to the impugning of his personal and professional credibility‚ÄîLoevy > proved that he was not merely a maker of documentary films but first and > foremost an artist with a point of view which he strives to bring before the > viewer for him to grapple with.\\" Over the next few years, Loevy was embarked on four major projects. The first of these was The Child Dreams (1994), an adaptation of a new play (1993) by noted Israeli playwright Hanoch Levin. The play itself was a remarkable achievement, inspired originally by the saga of the Saint Louis,Yitzhak Laor, \\"From the Destroyer 'Goodbye, Hitler' to 'The Child Dreams': An Introduction\\" (◊û◊î◊û◊©◊ó◊™◊™ '◊©◊ú◊ï◊ù ◊¢◊ú◊ô◊õ◊ù ◊î◊ô◊ò◊ú◊®' ◊¢◊ì '◊î◊ô◊ú◊ì ◊ó◊ï◊ú◊ù', ◊î◊ß◊ì◊û◊î), in Mitaam 19, September 2009. but transformed over time into an \\"operatic\\"Michael Ajzenstad, \\"Hanoch Levin: Satirist who both shocked and entranced Israel\\", in The Guardian, 27 August 1999. metaphor about death and the loss of faith in messianic redemption that transcends any historical setting. In the words of theater critic Michael Handelzaltz, \\"It is a moving play, evoking compassion and identification. It is shocking, farcical, warped, grotesque, and amazing.\\"Michael Handelzaltz, \\"Poetry about the Death of Children\\", in Hanoch Levin in His Own Way, Yediot Ahronot Press, 2001. Note that the word farcical is a loose translation of a Hebrew term that literally means circuslike. This was followed by Loevy's adaptation of Mr. Mani, a best-selling epic saga by Israeli author A.B. Yehoshua, with a script by longtime collaborator Gilad Evron. The novel is based on five conversations that tell the story of five generations of a Turkish‚ÄìGreek-Jewish family,Ethan Bronner, \\"Friendly Fire\\", in the New York Times, 13 November 2008. but in a larger sense, it is the story of Jewish and Israeli identity over the past two centuries. Originally, Loevy was hesitant about adapting the book for television, and asked the author: \\"You already have a book. Why do you need a movie?\\"From a talk delivered by Loevy to a forum on Middle Eastern Culture at the Van Leer Institute in Jerusalem, 1997, and printed in the magazine Cinemateque, vol. 142, September‚ÄìOctober 2006. In the book, five distinct \\"mono-dialogues\\", a term Loevy himself used in personal correspondence, are used to tell the story of the family to an assumed listening partner, who is neither seen nor heard. Each of these mono-dialogues is different, and given by different people in different languages or period-appropriate forms of Hebrew. Loevy captured this in the film, creating a new television vocabulary. The \\"mono-dialogue\\" technique eliminated the \\"fourth wall\\" taboo of television and film, according to which the audience absolves itself of traditional neutrality and assumes the role of a character in the story. In Loevy's own words, \\"Television demands text, but the television viewer is used to getting the complete text. Every question has an answer....\\" In Mr. Mani, the role of respondent is filled by the camera and, by extension, the audience itself. \\"As soon as the speaker turns to the camera‚Äîin other words, to the audience, speaking directly to it in a way that demands an answer, it is as if the speaker stepped out of the screen, almost like in Woody Allen's The Purple Rose of Cairo. The viewer is shaken up. The artificial nature of the situation itself in Mr. Mani screams its presence.\\". Like the characters in Luigi Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author, the characters cease being the subjects of scrutiny by some external viewer. The external viewer, i.e., the audience, becomes a partner in dialogue with the actors and an active participant in the story. Loevy later said that, \\"As the person responsible for the artistic aspect of the production, I was eulogized on one hand and derided on the other. Since it was first screened in 1996, Mr. Mani has won considerable acclaim for the way that it redefined the medium of television by transforming the viewer into an active participant. Mr. Mani was a critical success, and represented Israel at INPUT (the International Public Television Screening Conference) 1998. Life around Hiriya, a former garbage dump In 1999 Loevy expanded his scope to tackle a new issue that was rising to the forefront of Israeli consciousness: environmentalism. Fourteen Footnotes to a Garbage Mountain was a documentary film about the Hiriya, once Israel's national garbage dump, on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. To Israelis, however, the Hiriya is more than a dumpsite. It is a physical landmark‚Äîa flat-topped mountain (87 m)‚Äîtowering over the heavily urbanized coastal plain and the Ayalon River. Loevy succeeded in capturing the world of the Hiriya in its final days, as it was transformed from a dump to a recycling center and national park. He documented life around the site, and the art that sprouted up from its role‚Äîonce mocked‚Äîas a national compost heap. Loevy's next documentary film, Letters in the Wind (2001), was a tribute to noted Israeli actor Yossi Banai, one of the country's most noted performers and scion of a well-established theatrical family. Banai was particularly close to Nisim Aloni, whose plays featured prominently in Loevy's early films, and he was also close friends with Yaakov Shabtai (Crowned) and Hanoch Levin (The Child Dreams), two artists whose work Loevy also adapted for the screen. By making this film about Banai, it was as if Loevy had captured the artistic pulse of an entire generation that had dominated Israeli theater. Banai, however, was also known as a singer, and his interpretations of the chansons of Jacques Brel and especially Georges Brassens in Hebrew (translated by Naomi Shemer) had endeared him to an even wider public. Banai's music featured prominently in the film, so that the pulse it captured turned into what one reviewer termed \\"a metronome of Yossi Banai's life.\\"Yehudah Stav, \\"Ram Loevy's Film on Yossi Banai is one of the Highlights of the DocAviv Festival\\", in Maariv, 2001. Three television dramas Shortly before Letters in the Wind, Loevy directed a miniseries, Policeman (2000), based on a script by Galia Oz and Ofer Mashiach. In 1997, Loevy approached Moti Kirschenbaum with plans to direct a miniseries about a murder that took place in a fictional television station, Channel 66. Kirschenbaum approved of the project, but the following year Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to replace Kirschenbaum with Uri Porat. Porat had previously served as Director-General of the Israel Broadcasting Authority from 1984 to 1989, and was Director-General when Loevy produced Bread. Porat, however, was also closely aligned with the rightwing of the Israeli political spectrum, and had even referred to one of Hanoch Levin's anti-militaristic early plays as \\"theatrash\\".See \\"The Marker Caf√© (Hebrew). He used the made-up term ◊û◊ó◊ñ◊ë◊ú (mahazevel), combining the Hebrew words for play, mahazeh (◊û◊ó◊ñ◊î), and trash, zevel (◊ñ◊ë◊ú). The problem with Loevy's project, he claimed, was the plot and budgetary constraints.See Ruta Kupfer, \\"Murder on Channel 66 in Haaretz, 10 December 2001. Batya Gur wrote the script for Murder in Television House. Loevy denies that the script for Murder in Television House (2001) was a critique of Israeli public television. He had enlisted Batya Gur, a popular writer of detective fiction, to tell the story of a murder that took place in Channel 66, a fictional commercial television station. Some critics, however, considered the story to be a settling of accounts with Channel 1. The film revolves around several plot axes, one of which is the story of a veteran director who wants to make a film about the story \\"Ido and Einam\\" by the Nobel laureate Shmuel Yosef Agnon, but has the project rejected by the petty authorities who manage the station. The director decides to make the film anyway, but his girlfriend, the set designer is soon murdered, initiating a chain of murders at the station. Two factors adding to the complexity of the story is the fact that the murdered woman is also the ex-wife of the director's close friend, the station's senior programming manager, and the Agnon story that he is filming is also a story about a love triangle.See Oshra Schwartz, \\"Quiet, Murder\\", in Tasrit u-Bimui p. 22. The background for Murder in Television House was eerily reminiscent of life behind the scenes at Israel's Channel 1. When he rejected the film, Porat reportedly said, \\"People will think that there really are murders taking place here. In fact, the film opens with the line, \\"All of the events described in this film are fictional‚Äîexcept for one\\", leading the audience to wonder which one it is.Aviva Zaltzman, \\"A Wonderful Doughnut to Chew on This Holiday\\", in Maariv, 8 December 2001. Zaltzman continues: \\"Which one is it? Does Loevy know something we don't know? That is not, however, the only reference to real events in Israeli television. The Hebrew name of the film, ◊®◊¶◊ó, ◊û◊¶◊ú◊û◊ô◊ù (Retzach, metzalmim, literally, \\"Murder, we're filming\\"), is a play on the name of a popular TV show, ◊©◊ß◊ò, ◊û◊¶◊ú◊û◊ô◊ù (Sheket, metzalmim, or \\"Quiet, we're filming\\"), and among the subplots are a news story about striking workers (a continuation of the story Loevy began in Bread) (other news stories being covered throughout the film include tensions between religious and secular, men and women, the unemployed and the wealthy, Arabs and Jews, and new immigrants‚Äîthe detective investigating the murders is a Russian immigrant, who once served in the KGB and the FBI). What makes the film most shocking, however, is the final discovery that the roots of the murder date back to an incident the Six Day War, when a group of Israeli soldiers massacred 52 Egyptian prisoners at Ras Sudar in the Sinai. Loevy later admitted that this was the one incident in the plot that was not fictional. It was based on an account he had heard from a participant in 1970, while he was serving in the reserves. He went on to report the incident to the military authorities and, in consequence, was removed from his unit.Nurit Gratz, \\"An Old Shepherd's Memory Becomes a Malignant Spirit\\", in Haaretz, 14 April 2009. He had long wanted to make a film about the incident, but lacked the evidence to prove conclusively what had happened. Loevy later said: > \\"When the Six Day War ended, everyone thought that the 'mother of all wars' > was over and we won. I was terrified and thought to myself, 'What would > happen to our prisoners there if this story gets out?' Nevertheless, I feel > that we must not be silent.... People say that these things happen in > wartime and that there is loyalty to the army and loyalty among the troops, > which causes these things to disappear beneath the carpet. But I believe > that we are betraying our real responsibility, which is to take these > skeletons out of the closet, even if we think that the enemy has more > skeletons than us. We must not be silent. We are all part of this terrible > conspiracy of silence, and it is eating us up inside.\\" When Porat refused to produce the story, Loevy resigned from Channel 1. It was the end of a 31-year relationship. Channel 2 bought the rights to the series and Loevy directed it for them. Nevertheless, Loevy insists, \\"I had no intention of settling accounts with Channel 1. I love them like family.\\" But the underlying story behind Murder in Television House had haunted him almost since he began working at Israeli television. It was a story that he needed to tell, and it made no difference where he told it. Since then, Loevy made one more television drama, Skin (2005), written by Shoham Smith, about a former stripper who works in the Diamond Exchange District in Ramat Gan, gets involved in a murder. Throughout most of the decade, however, his work focused on documentary films. The 2000s Over the remainder of the decade, Loevy directed seven documentary films: * Close, Closed, Closure (also known as Gaza, L'enfermement, 2002) is a chilling account of life in the Gaza Strip, a place that Loevy describes as \\"a prison with one million inmates.\\"David Kehr, \\"Opposing Views, Shared Agonies,\\" in the New York Times, January 15, 2003. An Israeli-French coproduction, it was one of very few Israeli films screened in the Arab world, airing on SOREAD in Morocco and on three separate occasions on Al Arabiya television in the United Arab Emirates. * Genifa, Genifa (2003) is the story of an Israeli reserve unit that served during the Yom Kippur War. * May I Hug You (2004) addresses the issue of homelessness through the story of a theater company that is producing a play about the phenomenon. * Sakhnin, My Life (2006), also an Israeli-French coproduction, is a sports story about the Bnei Sakhnin football club from the Arab town of Sakhnin, the first team from an Arab town to win the State Cup in football, Israel's most popular sport. * Enter the Devil Drummer (2007) is an account of a group of young Israelis that travels to a small village in Mali to learn to play the djembe, and ends up learning more about themselves. * Barks (2007) is, ostensibly, the story of Israel as seen through the eyes of its dogs, though it is more about its owners than the pets themselves. Loevy explained that the inspiration for the film was the dog Dooby that he grew up with as a child, and a scene he once witnessed in an affluent neighborhood in Tel Aviv. It was there that he first encountered a dog with an electric collar, which would deliver a shock every time the animal barked. Though this never appears in the film, the incident eventually made him think about how Israelis are usually so kind to their dogs, even though they can act so cruelly to others. \\"The film is about Israeli society\\", he said, \\"about our racism.\\"Ruta Kupfer, \\"Where's the Dog Buried?\\" in Haaretz, 17 May 2007. * In The Games They Play (2009) Loevy returns to the world of sport to document an international student basketball tournament that endeavors to promote peace between nations. In 2007, Loevy also served as producer for the film The Woman From The Bubble about a young woman who translates sign language. It was an emotional project for Ram Loevy, not least because the film's director, Netta Loevy, was his daughter. Loey's first full length film, The Dead of Jaffa, is being written by his longtime collaborator Gilad Evron and produced by director-producer Eran Riklis. It is an intimate look at Arab life in the city of Jaffa both in 1947 and today. In an interview, Loevy said: \\"'I want to make a film for the big screen, but I am also afraid, because television is so human. It has human dimensions. It's there in the living room. Film has a mythical dimension to it. Its characters are distant gods, larger than life.\\" See also *List of Israel Prize recipients ReferencesExternal links * *Faculty page at Tel Aviv University Category:Living people Category:Israeli film directors Category:Israeli Jews Category:Israeli people of Polish-Jewish descent Category:Israeli screenwriters Category:Israel Prize in communication recipients Category:1940 births ","title":"Ram Loevy"},{"id":"25831569","title":"Florin Salam"},{"id":"25831625","text":"James Wood James Wood (14 December 1760 - 23 April 1839) was a mathematician, and Master of St John's College, Cambridge.

Local groups in Frydek county formed later. Members and electors of the SPP came from Protestant circles among the citizens of Cieszyn Silesia, so the largest organizations within the party existed in Bielsko and Cieszyn, where large Protestant communities lived. The party's largest local groups, as of 1913, existed in Skocz√≥w (214 members) and Cieszyn (210 members).

Silesian nationalist positions were first advocated by the Union of Austrian Silesians, which was founded in 1848 by Silesian deputies of the Austrian Parliament: Franz Hein, Hans Kudlich and Johann Demel von Elswehr. Such sentiments were also voiced informally by community institutions, like the paper Nowy Czas (New Time), edited by preacher Theodor Haase. \\"The Szlonzakian movement had expanded in the nineties of the 19th century, collecting Slavic people who didn‚Äôt want to vote for Poles or Czechs and chose attachment to a separate Silesian nation\\".Ru≈æena Vyhnalikova w A.

Activity in Austria In 1909 there were elections to the Silesian Parliament in Opava. The Silesian People's Party and German liberals had established a united election list, the Silesian Progressive Coalition, which included SPP candidates in rural electoral districts and German liberal candidates in urban electoral districts. Finally electors from the rural Bielsko-Strumie≈Ñ-Skocz√≥w electoral district chose one deputy ‚Äì the leader of Silesian People‚Äôs Party, J√≥zef Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ, who defeated J√≥zef Londzin from the Union of Silesian Catholics, who was leader of the Poles in Cieszyn Silesia. In the rural Cieszyn-Fry≈°t√°t-Jablunkov electoral district, Fraciszek Halfar of the Union of Silesian Catholics won with support from the SPP and Polish parties as well. The second deputy from this circle, Jan Michejda, defeated the SPP candidate, Josef Cichy, thanks to the votes of Polish Catholics and Czechs. Michejda became leader of the Protestant Polish National Party. The third SPP candidate, Edward Quasnitza, won the first round of elections in the rural Bohum√≠n-Slezsk√° Ostrava-Fr√Ωdek electoral district, but in the second round he was defeated by the Czech candidate Jan Poppe, mayor of Slezsk√° Ostrava, who was supported by the Poles. In July 1910, the non-political cultural base of Silesian People's Party was formed: the Union of Silesians (, , ), founded by Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ, Cichy, and Paul Wania, originally under the name Silesian People's Union \\"Our Homeland\\" (, ). From 1909 to 1923 the official paper of the Silesian People's Party was the weekly ≈ölƒÖzak (Silesian). In 1911 there were local elections in Austria. The SPP won in 39 municipalities of the counties of Bielsko and Cieszyn: Jaworze and Jasienica in the judicial district of Bielsko; B≈Çadnice Dolne, Cisownica, Golesz√≥w, Godzisz√≥w, G√≥rki Wielkie, Harbutowice, Hermanice, Kozakowice G√≥rne, Kozakowice Dolne, ≈ÅƒÖczka, Miƒôdzy≈õwieƒá, Nierodzim, Simoradz, Wieszczƒôta, Wilamowice and Ustro≈Ñ (here with a coalition of Szlonzakians and Germans) in the judicial district of Skocz√≥w; BƒÖk√≥w, Drogomy≈õl, Pruchna, Zaborze and Rudzica (here with a coalition of Szlonzakians and Poles) in the judicial district of Strumie≈Ñ; Ba≈ºanowice, Dziƒôgiel√≥w, Gumna, Konsk√°, Leszna G√≥rna, Komorn√≠ Lhotka, Nebory, Pu≈Ñc√≥w, Svibice, Zamarski, Horn√≠ ≈Ωukov and ≈†umbark (here with a coalition of Szlonzakians and Poles) in the judicial district of Cieszyn; Ly≈æbice, Mosty u Jablunkova and Old≈ôichovice in the judicial district of Jablunkov.PiƒÖtkowski Kazimierz, Stosunki narodowo≈õciowe w Ksiƒôstwie Cieszy≈Ñskim, Cieszyn 1918. In 1911 there were also elections to the Austrian Parliament in Vienna. SPP candidates lost many socialist votes and were defeated by Polish and Czech candidates. Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ did not even win in majority municipalities that his party had ruled in local elections. Eight municipalities around Bielsko, called a \\"German language island\\", which had voted for Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ in the Silesian Parliament elections in 1909, constituted an exception within the rural Bielsko electoral district. Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ won 26% of the votes in the Bielsko electoral district and 19% of the votes in the Cieszyn electoral district. Louis Schindler took 7.5% votes in the Frydek electoral district. In the period when Cieszyn Silesia belonged to Austria‚ÄìHungary, the Silesian People's Party reached the largest popularity in the triangle between Cieszyn, Wis≈Ça and Strumie≈Ñ, centering on Skocz√≥w, Jaworze, Ustro≈Ñ and Golesz√≥w. In the plebiscite period After World War I members of Silesian People's Party hoped to get Austrian Silesia a place as a free state in the federation of Austrian states. When this effort failed, they pushed for the independence of Cieszyn Silesia and probably a union with the formerly Prussian Upper Silesia. Upper Silesia's independence was advocated by the Upper Silesian Committee (which, beginning in January 1919, was called the Union of Upper Silesians). Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ, along with Richter and Fulda ‚Äì the leaders of the Delegation of German Parties of East Silesia ‚Äì wrote \\"Petition regarding an independent Republic of East Silesia ‚Äì Cieszyn\\". During the Paris Peace Conference, this petition was presented by a member of the town council in Bielsko ‚Äì Robert Piesch ‚Äì to a member of the Austrian delegation in Paris. The International Commission in Cieszyn had received \\"Petition regarding the rights of Cieszyn Land‚Äôs people to self-determination\\",Schroeder Eduard August, Denkschrift zum Selbstbestimmungsrechte des Teschner Landes (mit Beilage Die Neutralit√§tserkl√§rung des Herzogtums Teschen vom 5.

This option was supported by three members of the International Commission: Dubois from the United States, Tissi from Italy and Coulson from the United Kingdom, but the fourth ‚Äì Grenard, the representative of France ‚Äì was opposed to even including independence as an option in the planned plebiscite. The plebiscite was supposed to decide whether Cieszyn Silesia would belong to Poland or Czechoslovakia. Soon the leader of the SPP gained close contacts with leading Czechoslovak politicians: president Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk, prime minister Karel Kram√°≈ô, foreign affairs minister Edvard Bene≈° and future prime minister Vlastimil Tusar. They promised Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ that if Silesia lay within the borders of Czechoslovakia it would have political autonomy. Workers of the plebiscite committee of the Silesian People‚Äôs Party. J√≥zef Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ is marked with a white \\"X\\". Even when the SPP officially supported Czechoslovakia, the party did not abandon the option of independence, which was still advocated by its allies, the Germans of Cieszyn Silesia.

The SPP had more than 10,000 members and the Union of Silesians had 52,000.Protest ‚Äû≈ölƒÖskiej Partyi Ludowej, ‚Äû≈ölƒÖzak‚Äù nr 31, 6.08.1920. At this time, the Plebiscite Committee of the Silesian People's Party was founded in Karwina, along with 139 communal plebiscite committees in the counties of Bielsko (50 committees), Cieszyn (61 committees) and Fry≈°t√°t (28 committees).Andrzej Stƒôpniak, Kwestia narodowa a spo≈Çeczna na ≈ölƒÖsku Cieszy≈Ñskim pod koniec XIX i na poczƒÖtku XX wieku, Katowice 1986. In the winter of 1920 in Fry≈°tat, Franti≈°ek Janku and Pawe≈Ç Bajtek founded the Silesian Social-Democratic Party, formed from Silesian workers, who were mainly former members of the Polish Socialist Party and the Silesian People's Party from Wis≈Ça, Ustro≈Ñ and Golesz√≥w. Karol Smyczek, Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ‚Äôs personal secretary, was important in the formation of this new party's local organizations. Taken together, the members and supporters of the Szlonzakian movement numbered about 100,000 in 1920.Arnulf Hein, Vor 55 Jahren starb der Schlonsakenf√ºhrer Josef Ko≈ædo≈à, \\"Unser Oberschlesien\\" nr 23-24 von Dezember 2004. In July 1920, the Western allies divided Cieszyn Silesia without holding a plebiscite. In Poland On the Polish side, where about 80% of the Szlonzakian movement's organization was located,Dobrowolski Piotr, Ugrupowania i kierunki separatystyczne na G√≥rnym ≈ölƒÖsku i w Cieszy≈Ñskiem w latach 1918‚Äì1939, Warszawa ‚Äì Krak√≥w 1972. its activity was prohibited. \\"Members of the Silesian People‚Äôs Party and Union of Silesians were subject to persecution and arrests\\".Arnulf Hein, Vor 55 Jahren starb der Schlonsakenf√ºhrer Josef Ko≈ædo≈à, \\"Unser Oberschlesien\\" nr 23-24 von Dezember 2004. In January 1934, Konrad Markiton, Jan Pokrzyk, Pawe≈Ç Teda, Alfons Po≈õpiech, Jerzy Jele≈Ñ and Waleska Kubistowa re-formed the Silesian People's Party in Katowice. These people were also members of other Silesian organizations: the Association of Regional Writers, which edited the Trybuna ≈ölƒÖska (Silesian Tribune), the Cultural-Economic Association of Silesia and the Union of Upper Silesian Defence. They connected with the former electors Jan Kustos from the former Prussian Upper Silesia and J√≥zef Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ from the Polish part of Cieszyn Silesia. On April 15, 1934, Polish police confiscated the first issue of the party's bilingual paper, ≈ölƒÖska Stra≈º Ludowa ‚Äì Schlesische Volkswacht (Silesian People‚Äôs Watch) and stamped its editorial office. This act marked the end of the organization's activities in Katowice.Dobrowolski Piotr, Ugrupowania i kierunki separatystyczne na G√≥rnym ≈ölƒÖsku i w Cieszy≈Ñskiem w latach 1918‚Äì1939, Warszawa ‚Äì Krak√≥w 1972. Activity in Czechoslovakia In 1923 there was a schism in the Silesian People's Party. Three factions appeared: one German-speaking (including Rudolf Francus, Walter Harbich, Karol Sikora, Arthur Wohrizek, Emmanuel Harbich, Otto Wohlman, Karl Kordula and Hans Peschke); a second Polish-speaking (including Karol Folwartschny, Gustaw Wa≈Çach, J√≥zef Santarius, Adam Broda and Pawe≈Ç Tomanek); and a third pro-Czech (including Karol Smyczek, Karol Pawlas and Alfred Farnik). The German-language faction started in some communal and all-district elections in a coalition with the German-minority election community. The Polish-language faction formed election coalitions with Polish minority parties. Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ, as leader of all the party, linked these two factions. In some communes he stood for election alone. The pro-Czech faction cut ties with Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ and became a separate organization, closely affiliated with the Republican Party of Agricultural and Smallholder People. In communal elections it stood for election alone or entered Czech coalitions. Sometimes in one commune started all three factions of the SPP, which competed among themselves. In communal elections the SPP gained various success. Its two candidates (Rudolf Francus and Karol Sikora) were members in the ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n county council, and the number of its members in the town council of ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n was still expanding (five in 1923, ten in 1927, twelve in 1931), and from 1923 to 1928, Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ served four terms as mayor of ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n. The SPP dominated the commune of Svibice too, and it had a large number of communal council members, starting in various political configurations (alone as the Silesian People's Party, in a separate Polish-language faction, in a separate German-language faction, in a broad German and Polish coalition, and in various communal and citizens committees). The newspaper of the Polish-language faction was Nasz Lud (Our People). \\"≈ölƒÖzak w Czechos≈Çowacji\\" (Silesian in Czechoslovakia) and Nasz ≈ölƒÖzak (Our Silesian) were the pro-Czech papers. The Czechs founded the organization Czech-Szlonzakian Unity (ƒåesko-≈°lonzack√° jednota), which incorporated weak SPP organizations in Frydek county and connected it to the Czech political camp. The leading members of the Silesian People's Party in Czechoslovakia were: J√≥zef Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ, Rudolf Pierniczek, Karol Malina, Rudolf Francus, Walter Harbich in ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n, Ludwik Niedoba i Alojzy Kuchejda in Jablunkov, Oswald Bayer in T≈ôinec, Gustaw Wa≈Çach in Orlov√°, Robert Wallach in Komorn√≠ Lhotka, Karol Sikora and Jan Pasterny in ≈†umbark, Karol Kubik in Ly≈æbice, Bruno Kappel in T≈ôanovice, Karol Bruck in Svibice and J√≥zef Pellar in Bystrzyca. In the 1925 parliamentary elections in Czechoslovakia, the SPP formed a coalition with the Polish minority parties: the Union of Silesian Catholics, the Polish People's Party and the Polish Socialist Workers Party. Gustaw Wa≈Çach, a member of the Szlonzakian movement, took third place, after Leon Wolf from the Union of Silesian Catholics and Wies≈Çaw W√≥jcik from the Polish Socialist Workers Party. The election slogan of the Polish coalition was \\"Silesia for Silesians\\", which was originally an SPP slogan that all Polish organizations had opposed in the Austrian period.Dariusz Jerczy≈Ñski, Historia Narodu ≈ölƒÖskiego (History of Silesian Nation), second edition (implemented and corrected), Zabrze 2006, page 195Krzysztof Nowak, Leon Wolf (1883‚Äì1968) Biografia polityczna, Katowice 2002. Leon Wolf was elected deputy. In 1927 the Czechoslovak authorities, against their own guarantees to the SPP, decided to connect Czech Silesia with Moravia. In response the mayor of Opava, Ernst Franz, founded the Committee for the Protection of Silesian Rights, which opposed this decision. The committee produced a German-language brochure by Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ, \\"Right of our Silesian homeland for administration unhabitance\\", in which he argued that the merging of Czech Silesia with Moravia was irrational, based on historical, social and economic issues.Josef Ko≈ædon, Das Recht unserer schlesischer Heimat auf die verwaltungm√§ssige Selbst√§ndigkeit, Troppau 1927. The SPP, the Union of Silesians and all the organizations of Polish and German minorities protested the decision, but authorities in Prague ignored them. In the 1928f elections to the Silesia‚ÄìMoravia regional assembly, the SPP formed a coalition with the Poles again. A Szlonzakian‚ÄìPolish‚ÄìJewish election list included Gustaw Wa≈Çach from the SPP, but nobody from this list was elected. In the National Assembly elections in 1929 and elections to Silesian- Moravian Regional Assembly in 1935, the SPP supported the Polish-Jewish list. In the National Assembly elections of 1935, the SPP supported Polish candidate Karol Junga from a Polish-Slovak-Ruthenian list, the Autonomy Bloc. On the other hand, Walter Harbich, leader of the German-language faction, supported Sudetendeutsche Partei. In 1938 Nazi Germany claimed the Opava Silesia and other Czechoslovak territories inhabited by ethnic German majorities. Poland claimed the Zaolzie region. In this situation, on September 8, 1938, the Silesian People's Party, as \\"representative of the Silesian nationality\\", sent a messeage to the representative of the United Kingdom, Sir Walter Runciman, in which it reminded him of the question of the plebiscite in 1920. In this new emergency, the SPP demanded four allied powers to execute a plebiscite regarding the future of Cieszyn Silesia. The petition, to which was attached Kurt Witt's work \\"Die Teschener Frage\\" (\\"The Cieszyn question\\"), was signed by Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ as mayor of ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n, along with Bruno Kappel, Karol Kubik, Robert Wallach, Walter Harbich and ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n county council member Rudolf Francus.Grobelny Andƒõlin, Te≈°insko jako p≈ôedmƒõt nƒõmecke politiky v letech 1933‚Äì39, Opava 1970. On September 18, 1938 Walter Harbich as leader of the \\"assembly of the Silesian nationality\\" sent a telegram to Adolf Hitler, requesting the independence of Cieszyn Silesia under the protection of Nazi Germany. A petition about this issue was sent to the British prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, too.Andƒõlin Grobelny, Te≈°insko jako p≈ôedmƒõt nƒõmecke politiky v letech 1933‚Äì39, Opava 1970. Decline On October 2, 1938 Polish Army incorporated Zaolzie into Poland, and eventually the Wehrmacht incorporated Silesian territory near Opava and other territories into Nazi Germany. On October 2, 1938, Rudolf Francus and Walter Harbich, the leaders of the German-language faction of the Silesian People's Party sent a telegram to Adolf Hitler, speaking for the Silesian people and German people from Bohum√≠n in protest of the cession of the Zaolzie to Poland.Otokar Ka≈àa, Dokumenty o pronƒõmeske anga≈æovnosti Josefa Ko≈ædonƒõ a jeho stoupenc≈Ø (≈†lonzak≈Ø), Opava /otisk \\"Slezsky Sbornik\\" 1971 All the telegrams were sent without Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ's knowledge.Dariusz Jerczy≈Ñski, Historia Narodu ≈ölƒÖskiego (History of Silesian Nation), second edition (implemented and corrected), Zabrze 2006, page 233; equal to A. Grobelny, 1970 and O. Ka≈àa, 1971 On October 6, 1938, Polish authorities banned all non-Polish organizations in Zaolzie. German and Czechoslovak organizations were banned, as well as the Silesian People's Party and the Union of Silesians. Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ was deposed as mayor of ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n and authorities forced him to leave Cieszyn Silesia and go to Opava. At this time, Walter Harbich, in cooperation with Paul Lamatsch but without Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ's knowledge, subordinated the illegal Silesian People's Party to the Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle (\\"Central office of ethnic Germans living abroad\\") in Berlin. Two weeks after the invasion of Poland by Germany, Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ \\"was welcomed by ovation\\" back to Cieszyn.Wilhelm Szewczyk, Syndrom ≈õlƒÖski. Szkice o ludziach i dzie≈Çach, Katowice 1986. In December 1939, Nazi Germans organized a police census, in which 157,000 citizens of Cieszyn Silesia declared themselves members of the \\"Szlonzakian nationality\\" (Volk der Schlonsaken) and 184,000 declared Szlonzakian (Schlonsakisch) to be their native language. The Germans did not legalise the activities of the Silesian People's Party or reinstate Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ as mayor. The Germans used the immense popularity of party's ideals for the purpose of Germanization.

In 1988, the Independent MP for the state seat of North Shore, Ted Mack, resigned from Parliament to avoid qualifying for a parliamentary pension. Read contested the resulting by- election as an independent with Mack's endorsement, and easily defeated her nearest rival, Liberal candidate Jillian Skinner. In the 1991 redistribution, however, the neighbouring seat of Mosman was abolished, and Read was challenged by its Liberal MP, Phillip Smiles and Smiles won narrowly. Read contested North Shore one more time unsuccessfully in the by-election held in 1994 in which she was defeated in a rematch by her old Liberal rival Jillian Skinner. A crime novel written by Read, The More Things Change, was published in 1996 by Random House. In the novel the body of a member of parliament is found floating in the pool in parliament house.

It was designed as a night reconnaissance aircraft for the Imperial Japanese Navy, but was not accepted, the two aircraft built being used as transports as the Type 96 Transport Flying Boat during the Second World War. Development and design In 1936 the Imperial Japanese Navy drew up a requirement for an aircraft to replace the Aichi Type 96 Reconnaissance Seaplane as a specialised night reconnaissance aircraft, intended to spot naval gunfire in night actions and to shadow enemy forces at night, allowing submarines to be directed to targets. The requirement was passed to Aichi and Kawanishi, with both companies producing aircraft to meet the navy's needs. While Aichi produced a biplane similar to the aircraft that was to be replaced, Kawanishi designed a gull winged cantilever monoplane. It was powered by a single pusher Hiro Type 91 w engine strut mounted above the wing driving a four-bladed propeller, with its radiator mounted in a fairing above the rear fuselage so that it was located in the propeller's slipstream. It was fitted with retractable wingtip floats, while its wings folded to aid storage aboard the cruisers of the Japanese Navy. The first of two prototypes of Kawanishi's design, the Experimental 11-Shi Special Reconnaissance Seaplane, with the short designation E11K, made its maiden flight on 11 June 1937. It proved to have poor stability and water handling, while the engine installation overheated. It was unsuitable for the night reconnaissance role, with the Aichi design proving generally superior and being ordered into production as the Aichi E11A. Operational history The two prototypes were fitted with retractable beaching gear, in order to serve as a utility transport aircraft, and was accepted into service by the Japanese Navy as the Type 96 Transport. These aircraft were used as liaison aircraft for reconnaissance seaplane squadrons and remained in use well into the Second World War.

I can imagine a very hammy production of Last of the Red Hot Lovers that might satisfy for as long as it took to say the lines. But this movie version strives for a dismal realism that plays under the lines and doesn't even support their potential for theatrical excitement.\\"Roger Greenspun, \\"Last of the Red Hot Lovers\\" Aug. 18, 1972 https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9802E1DF1631E63BBC4052DFBE668389669EDE Variety wrote that a \\"very funny play\\" had \\"been made into a funny motion picture. The absence of the word 'very' is the principal difference between the two versions and as Doc Simon himself handled the transition, the only excuse for the drop in laughter volume is, possibly, over-familiarity.\\"\\"Film Revired: Last of the Red Hot Lovers\\". Variety. June 7, 1972. 18.

Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times agreed, writing, \\"After the stunning confrontation of Arkin and Sally Kellerman, everything else is a bit of a letdown.\\" Nevertheless he found the film \\"a substantial moviegoing experience, funny and touching, and its troubles stem, refreshingly, from trying not too little but too much.\\" In his annual Movie Guide, Leonard Maltin gave the film a BOMB rating, calling it \\"a shoddy production for which the term 'photographed stage play' must have been invented.\\" See also * List of American films of 1972 ReferencesExternal links  Category:1972 films Category:1970s sex comedy films Category:Adultery in films Category:American films Category:American films based on plays Category:American sex comedy films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on works by Neil Simon Category:Films directed by Gene Saks Category:Films produced by Howard W.

The airline operated from 1935-1940\\\\. History=Background In 1932 Imperial Airways began operating a weekly flights from England to South Africa, and the flight served numerous cities throughout Africa on its route. An increase in traffic numbers saw the flight being operated twice weekly from January 1935, and it was at this time that the airline completed negotiations with the Air Ministry for the creation of a route from Khartoum in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan to Nigeria. It was intended for the flights to terminate in Lagos, but because there were no airports which were suitable for operations, the flights terminated in Kano, and passengers connected to Lagos by train. Imperial Airways required an airline to operate between Kano and the Elder Dempster Lines docks in at Takoradi in the Gold Coast. To this end, Imperial Airways (Nigeria and Gold Coast) Limited was jointly formed between Imperial and Elder Dempster on 7 November 1935, and it was operated as Elders Colonial Airways. Imperial Airways owned a half stake in the company and supplied all aircraft and personnel. It was planned for Elders Colonial services to run so they would connect with the arrival and departure of both Elder Dempster ships and Imperial's flights, allowing for quick distribution of passengers and mail throughout the Gold Coast and Nigeria. Operational years On 13 October 1937 flights on the route from Lagos-Accra were commenced utilising a de Havilland Express from Imperial Airways. It was reported that traffic on the route was held back by health issues, but Imperial Airways overcame these concerns by installing an apparatus capable of killing mosquitoes in the aircraft. A weekly service in conjunction with Imperial from Freetown to Bathurst was commenced on 25 June 1938 with Short Scion Senior, and was operated via Conakry, Bolama and Bissau. The Lagos-Takoradi route was started on 4 April 1939, whilst on 15 July 1939 the Freetown-Bathurst service was terminated. Following the sinking of one of the airline's Short Scion Senior aircraft in Bathurst whilst at anchor in August 1939, services to Bathurst were halted in their entirety. With the onset of World War II, Elders Colonial Airways ceased operations on 14 June 1940, and after the war services did not resume, rather flights were replaced by West African Airways Corporation.

The main antagonist of the second season (after being introduced in the first), Fulcrum, is revealed in the Season Two finale to be only one part of the Ring, which then serves as the main antagonist of Season Three. The Ring's goals are not known, but it is clearly in conflict with the legitimate American intelligence community, and attempts to manipulate politics in several countries to accomplish its ends. Organization Little information about the Ring has been revealed so far. In \\"Chuck Versus the Ring,\\" Bryce Larkin reveals that FULCRUM was only one part of the Ring, however he died from a fatal gunshot wound before he could say anything further about what he knew. Unlike FULCRUM, which is primarily made up of rogue elements of the CIA, the Ring has operatives outside the intelligence community.\\"Chuck Versus the Ring\\" How much the government knows about the organization is also unknown. Bryce Larkin was familiar with their existence, and Daniel Shaw has been tracking them for at least five years by the time he takes over command of Team Bartowski.\\"Chuck Versus Operation Awesome\\" In \\"Chuck Versus Operation Awesome\\" he reveals that the Ring is primarily cell-based and consists of a large number of small and decentralized groups. Ring cells operate with a high degree of autonomy, and an agent who misidentified Devon as a spy would not have reported in to her superiors until it was confirmed they had him \\"turned.\\" All Ring agents are issued distinctive, circular smart phones. These phones work off a closed network that was impossible to crack until Team Bartowski captured one. Also, nearly all Ring agents carry FN Five-seven pistols. The Director The Director is the head of the Ring. He first appeared in the third season episode \\"Chuck Versus the American Hero,\\" where he was revealed to be the driving force behind the Ring itself. He is portrayed by actor Mark Sheppard. Biography Nothing has been revealed about the Director's identity, and even his real name is unknown. Although his nationality has also not been identified, he does speak with an English accent, reflecting the international nature of the Ring. Series The Director was first mentioned by his subordinates in \\"Chuck Versus the American Hero,\\" when he sent them to apprehend Shaw and bring him in, but this plan was inadvertently thwarted by Morgan, Casey and Devon. Believing he had an opportunity to take out the Director and a substantial part of the Ring's senior leadership, Shaw contacted him and agreed to come in as a Trojan Horse, intending to use himself as a walking targeting beacon for an air strike. The Director confronted Shaw in an underground facility, where he played him a surveillance video recovered from the corpse of CIA turncoat and Ring informant Hunter Perry to \\"educate him\\" about his slain wife, Evelyn. The video revealed that Evelyn Shaw was not killed by a Ring agent as Shaw believed, but by Sarah. Shaw attempted to attack the director, but his adversary revealed he was never actually in the room and Shaw was instead interacting with a sophisticated hologram. The Director therefore escaped the destruction of the facility when it was bombed shortly afterwards. In \\"Chuck Versus the Other Guy,\\" the Director is involved in a complex plot to turn Shaw to the Ring. He convinced Shaw that the government believed Eve had already been turned, and utilized Sarah to execute her before Evelyn proved she was a liability. The Director allowed Shaw to strengthen his position with the government by allowing him to capture the Ring's prototype for the Cipher and \\"eliminate\\" him. Shaw then met him in Paris where he turned over the Cipher and all government technical data on the Intersect. While Shaw was dealt with by Chuck, the Director attempted to escape with the Intersect data, but he was intercepted and apprehended by Casey. Development Actor Mark Sheppard's casting was first indicated on December 10, 2009, and later confirmed by Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune. More details emerged in an interview with ifmagazine.com, in which Sheppard confirmed he will be playing the Director of the Ring. Few other details of the character, or the nature of his position within the Ring, have been revealed however in his IF Magazine interview, Sheppard identifies the Director with Blofeld and notes that he will figure heavily into Casey's story arc. He further suggests that the Director may become a recurring role in the series. =Personality= As with his origins, the series has so far revealed very little of the Director's personality, however the Director has proven cautious and calculating. In \\"Chuck Versus the American Hero,\\" he confronted Shaw using a sophisticated hologram rather than expose himself directly to danger, commenting with disbelief that Shaw thought he would meet with him face to face. The Director is also extremely manipulative. He revealed Evelyn Shaw was actually killed by the CIA to turn Shaw to the Ring, and claimed the CIA suspected Eve herself had been turned and ordered the hit to secure Shaw's loyalty. In \\"Chuck Versus the Other Guy,\\" he conspires to gain access to the technical data on the Intersect to complete the Ring's system by taking advantage of Shaw's single- minded desire to avenge his wife's death, and orchestrates a complex series of operations to achieve this objectives. Ring Elders In \\"Chuck Versus the Predator,\\" Fulcrum agent Vincent reports to a panel of five superiors whose faces are hidden in shadow. They give him permission to further investigate the Burbank Buy More to further his search for Orion. In \\"Chuck Versus the Mask\\" it is revealed that this panel is actually senior leadership of the Ring, when Vassily reports Daniel Shaw's involvement in the interception of a chemical weapon. The council has Vassilis summarily executed when he presses them on how they wish to deal with Shaw. In \\"Chuck Versus the Ring: Part II\\", the Ring Council is formally introduced as the Five Elders, who planned to take over the NSA and CIA. However, they were all captured by Team Bartowski. First seen in: Chuck Versus the Predator. Motives The motives of the Ring are currently unknown. Much like FULCRUM, they did attempt to gain control of the Intersect until it was destroyed by Chuck Bartowski. They hired arms dealer Karl Stromberg to obtain and move an intelligence safe for them, and also attempted to assassinate Premier Allejandro Goya to prevent him from opening his country to democratic elections.\\"Chuck Versus the Angel de la Muerte\\" Unlike FULCRUM, who saw themselves as patriots attempting to protect the United States' dominance in the world,\\"Chuck Versus the Suburbs\\"\\"Chuck Versus the Beefcake\\" their assassination attempt against Goya indicates the Ring has wider global interests. \\"Chuck Versus the Nacho Sampler\\" has confirmed that the Ring has a continuing interest in obtaining the Intersect. They stole burned-out components of Intersect 2.0 from a government holding facility after Chuck destroyed it, and hired a computer expert to attempt reconstruction of the device. \\"Chuck Versus the Other Guy\\" revealed that the Ring had succeeded in producing their own prototype of the Cipher, the central component of the Intersect, although Shaw noted significant flaws in the device. Shaw later provided the Ring detailed technical information so they could refine their prototype, however this was intercepted by Casey and it is unknown how much data they managed to recover. After their defeat in Paris the Ring briefly laid low. In \\"Chuck Versus the Role Models\\" the organization resurfaced again when one of their operatives poisoned Devon in such a way as to mimic the symptoms of malaria in order to remove him and Ellie from Africa. \\"Chuck Versus the Tooth\\" begins to bring their plans for Ellie into sharper focus, when Ellie is manipulated into becoming an asset for the organization under the belief that her father was in danger. \\"Chuck Versus the Living Dead\\" reveals the Ring is after Stephen to capture a device he has developed called the Governor, which controls the electrical impulses the Intersect generates during a flash and poses a threat to the brain of an Intersect host. Although the exact and final goals of the Ring were never clearly defined, in \\"Chuck Versus the Subway\\" and \\"Chuck Versus the Ring: Part II\\" they attempted to seize control of the CIA and NSA during a coup, first by discrediting Team Bartowski and General Beckman, then by using Shaw to arrange the replacement of multiple senior members of both organizations with the Elders. The plot was ultimately foiled by the team, and both Shaw and the Elders were apprehended. Affiliated Organizations The Ring is a larger organization composed of many other groups, in addition to its own cells. =FULCRUM= FULCRUM was the main antagonist of the series for parts of Season One and the entirety of Season Two. They are a CIA splinter group seeking to maintain America's place in the world, although their exact goals were never specified beyond this and acquisition of the Intersect. FULCRUM's status at the end of season two was not conclusively revealed. =McTiernan Industries= In \\"Chuck Versus the Subway\\", Chuck flashes on a control panel outside the Ring base, identifying the manufacturer, McTiernan Industries, as a subsidiary of the Ring. Development The Ring was first introduced in passing in the season two finale, \\"Chuck Versus the Ring.\\" The episode revealed no further information about the organization, other than that FULCRUM is only one part of it. \\"Chuck Versus the Tic Tac\\" would later push back the Ring's direct involvement in the events of the series to as early as \\"Chuck Versus the Sensei\\". According to Chris Fedak, the Ring has a specific goal so far revealed only as different from the goals of Fulcrum.Interview, April 27, 2009: What's Alan Watching? List of Known Agents=Jack Artman Jack Artman (Andrew Connolly) is a poisoner sent by the Ring to assassinate Premier Allejandro Goya when the latter attempted to open up free democratic elections in his country, because the Ring desired to preserve his country's current situation. His first attempt was foiled by Devon Woodcomb, who successfully treated Goya's heart failure. A second attempt also failed when Devon mistook Casey‚Äîwho had spotted Artman and was moving in‚Äîfor the assassin. He made a third attempt on Goya with a poisoned cigar, which Devon again managed to thwart (using Casey's knowledge of Goya's blood type as well as Casey's blood). Artman expressed a familiarity with Casey and attempted to kill him, but Casey managed to defeat him and escape. Artman escaped as well, and kidnapped Devon at the hospital where he worked. Chuck's flash on Artman indicates that he was born in Connecticut, his specialty is chemical engineering and he was involved in the highly publicized poisoning of ex-KGB colonel and Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in London. First seen in: Chuck Versus the Angel de la Muerte. Ty Bennett Ty Bennett (Carl Lumbly), born April 11, 1963 at Camp Foster Marine Base, is a karate and kung fu expert who was previously a combat trainer with the NSA, serving as the sensei for John Casey. When he first appears in present day, he is working as a global arms dealer and steals an inertial guidance system from the Global Launch Agency. Bennett attempts to recruit Casey, but Casey rejects the offer with disdain. Following a protracted abduction and hand-to-hand battle, Casey becomes the first known agent to force Bennett to \\"tap out,\\" contributing to Bennett's apprehension. Bennett is also known to crush cans with his bare hands.NBC.com: Chuck Spy Dossiers \\"Chuck Versus the Sensei\\" \\"Chuck Versus the Tic Tac\\" later reveals that Bennett was not working independently after all, but had in fact been turned to the Ring by Col. James Keller. First seen in: Chuck Versus the Sensei. Julius Burrow Julius Burrow (Bob McCracken) was the Ring operative in charge of handling Manoosh Depak while the engineer was working on rebuilding the Intersect. When Manoosh attempted to cheat the Ring, he tracked him to Weap-Con in Dubai and demanded he turn over the prototype after capturing him and Team Bartowski. First seen in: Chuck Versus the Nacho Sampler. Javier Cruz Javier Cruz (Adoni Maropis) was a Ring assassin. He was sent to kill someone at a nightclub where Casey and Sarah were running a sting operation believing him to be a courier, before Chuck inadvertently blew the op when he thought Sarah was being targeted. Javier escaped but tracked Chuck to the Buy More, where he murdered Emmett and captured Chuck and Sarah. He was gunned down in a firefight by Casey during his rescue of his teammates. First seen in: Chuck Versus the Pink Slip. Del and Neil Del (Diedrich Bader) and Neil (Cedric Yarbrough) were two Ring operatives who infiltrated the Buy More in an effort to locate and destroy Castle, acting on the Council's intelligence that identified the store as a CIA substation. They entered the store posing as corporate executives of Cost-Less who were interested in buying the store, and began interviewing the employees while the rest of their team searched for the entrance to Castle. Del successfully identified Chuck as Agent Carmichael and located the facility. However, before his team could destroy the government's data on the Ring and eliminate Chuck and Morgan, Chuck flashed and defeated them with Morgan's assistance. First seen in: Chuck Versus the Beard. James Keller Col. James Keller (Robert Patrick) was a former US military black ops officer who recruited John Casey‚Äîthen known as Alex Coburn‚Äîinto the NSA in 1989 while operating in Honduras. The full extent of Keller's activities during the time from his recruitment of Casey and when he re-emerged in the present day are unknown, however at some point Keller joined the Ring and turned former NSA combat instructor Ty Bennett as well. A flash by Chuck suggests that Keller had been dishonorably discharged. He contacted Casey following a failed attempt by the Ring to seize Castle and blackmailed him into stealing a top-secret government emotion-suppressing and performance-enhancing drug called Laudanol. Keller threatened to murder Casey's ex-fiancee if he refused to obey. However the plot was foiled by the team, and Keller was killed when Casey snapped his neck. First seen in: Chuck Versus the Tic Tac. Miles Miles (Tug Coker) was a member of Casey's old special ops unit. Miles murders an imprisoned Ted Roark and his own comrades on Casey's team after Ellie and Devon's second wedding. He spares Casey's life because his commander once saved his. Miles was revealed as an agent of \\"the Ring,\\" an organization of which FULCRUM was only one part. He attempted to steal the rebuilt Intersect, but was foiled by Chuck, who uploaded the computer into his own brain again before destroying the system. Miles attempted to retaliate by killing Chuck, but was defeated when it was revealed the Intersect gave Chuck advanced martial arts skills. First seen in: Chuck Versus the Ring. Hugo Panzer Hugo Panzer (\\"Stone Cold\\" Steve Austin) is one of two Ring agents transporting the key to the Ring Intelligence Safe on a flight from Los Angeles to Paris. He is an expert at close-range combat and uses a short sword that he keeps in his checked luggage. After being rendered unconscious three times during the flight, he is apprehended upon arrival in France. Steve Austin reprises his role in the fourth season episode, \\"Chuck Versus the Cubic Z.\\" He is rendered into the team's custody when a prison transport on which he is being moved breaks down and is diverted instead to Castle. He escapes after fabricating a weapon from a newspaper innocently given to him by one of the guards and reveals that he was contracted by Volkoff to kill Heather Chandler, who was being transferred with him, in retaliation for her failed attempt to acquire her husband's plans for the modified F-22 Raptor. After chasing the team and Heather through the store he is briefly recaptured by Casey, only to escape again. He is finally subdued when Big Mike stuns him with a cattle prod while fleeing through the Buy More. Although Panzer is a very large and formidable man, he displays a great degree of intelligence. He was able to successfully hack into Castle's computer systems both to prevent Casey from gaining access to the facility, and to override the door security in the holding cells in an attempt to kill Heather. Panzer is also the first member of a previous season's main antagonist organization to return after that organization's defeat. His escape in Castle was scored with a reprise of the Ring's droning theme music from Season 3. First seen in: Chuck Versus First Class Sydney Prince Sydney Prince (Angie Harmon) was a Ring operative who headed a cell in Los Angeles. She tried to recruit Devon Woodcomb after mistaking him for a spy, but was shot by Daniel Shaw after being cornered by the team. However, in \\"Chuck Versus the Ring, Part II\\", an Intersect flash show that Sydney was in fact captured. Two members of her team, Glenn and Ian, are referred to by name. First seen in: Chuck Versus Operation Awesome. Serena Serena (Josie Davis) is one of two Ring agents transporting the key to the Ring Intelligence Safe on a flight from Los Angeles to Paris. She was placed aboard the flight in the guise of a flight attendant to support Panzer during his mission. Serena freed Panzer after he was disabled in the cargo hold, and poisoned Chuck to force him to return the key. She was later incapacitated by falling luggage after Sarah took control of the aircraft via satellite and destabilized it, and was apprehended when the flight arrived in France. Shaw expressed a familiarity with Serena's tactics, and implicated her in several poisonings of high-ranking officials. First seen in: Chuck Versus First Class. Daniel Shaw Daniel Shaw (Brandon Routh) was a CIA operative and expert on the Ring assigned by General Beckman to lead Operation Bartowski in their efforts to destroy the organization. His wife was killed five years prior to his joining the team while investigating the Ring, and he believed that the Ring was responsible for her murder. He learned in \\"Chuck Versus the American Hero\\" his wife was actually killed by Sarah during her red test, and the Director reveals in \\"Chuck Versus the Other Guy\\" her death was ordered by Langston Graham after the CIA uncovered information suggesting Evelyn had been turned by the Ring, although the Director never himself states that Eve had turned. Shaw subsequently turned himself and joined the Ring, but soon after was shot and presumably killed by Chuck to prevent Shaw from killing Sarah in revenge for his wife's death. However, in Chuck Versus the Tooth and Chuck Versus the Living Dead, it is revealed that Shaw is still alive, and has downloaded the Ring's new Intersect. He is presumably the person behind Justin Sullivan's plot to use Ellie for luring Steven Bartowski out of hiding. First seen in: Chuck Versus Operation Awesome. After the Director's arrest Shaw continues working for The Ring, and in the season three finale, Chuck Versus the Ring: Part II, he kills Steven. He remains the last men left of The Ring after his arrest and in season five he blackmails his way out to get revenge. Justin Sullivan Justin Sullivan (Scott Holroyd) is a security coordinator who operated in Africa for Doctors Without Borders. He met Devon and Ellie after their arrival, punctuated by killing a venomous snake approaching the couple while having dinner. Later, while Ellie expressed her frustration at her difficulties adjusting to working under such conditions, Justin encouraged her over the work they were doing. He further assisted them with making an emergency evacuation when Devon was stricken with malaria. However, as they departed, Justin made a call on a Ring communicator announcing that the couple were out of the way and that Devon's symptoms were artificially engineered. Justin follows Ellie back to Burbank in \\"Chuck Versus the Tooth\\" and poses as a CIA operative to gain Ellie's confidence and recruit her as an asset. He claims that Casey is a double-agent who poses a significant threat to her father, and manipulates her into revealing Stephen left a means for his children to contact him when he left after her wedding. Justin uses Ellie in an attempt to capture Stephen and steal the Governor, which regulates the electrical impulses of an Intersect flash and helps protect the host from harmful side-effects and brain damage. He was captured, along with the Ring Elders, when they attempted to leave the Joint Security Summit, in \\"Chuck Versus the Ring: Part II\\". Justin has the most appearances in the series among villains, not counting Daniel Shaw, who entered the series as a member of Operation Bartowski. First seen in: Chuck Versus the Role Models. Nicos Vassilis Nicos Vassilis (Henri Lubatti) was an agent of the Ring charged with smuggling a chemical weapon in via a golden mask of Alexander the Great. At some point in the past his face was burned by Shaw, leaving him with a scar. When Chuck and Sarah successfully swapped out the mask, Vassilis mistook Chuck for the agent in charge, believing he used Sarah and Hannah to gain access to the vault. He attempted to use Hannah to force Chuck to return the mask, but was duped with a duplicate, which Chuck smashed to make him believe the weapon was released. As he fled the scene, he saw Shaw with Sarah, and reported his presence to his superiors. Vassilis was executed for his failure. First seen in: Chuck Versus the Mask.

Developed in 2006 by a Sydney-based company named Audinate, Dante builds and improves on previous audio over Ethernet technologies, such as CobraNet and EtherSound. Like most other audio over Ethernet technologies, Dante is primarily for professional, commercial applications. Most often, it is used in applications where a large number of audio channels must be transmitted over relatively long distances or to multiple locations. Digital audio provides several advantages over traditional analog audio distribution. Audio transmitted over analog cables can be adversely affected by signal degradation due to electromagnetic interference, high-frequency attenuation, and voltage drop over long cable runs. Thanks to digital multiplexing, the cabling requirements for digital audio distribution are almost always reduced when compared to analog audio. Dante also provides specific advantages over first-generation audio over Ethernet technologies, such as CobraNet and EtherSound. Technological advancements include native gigabit support, higher channel count, lower latency, and automatic configuration. History A Dante interface card installed in a Lawo sound mixer. After Motorola closed an Australian research facility in 2003, current Audinate CTO Aidan Williams brought a team of researchers to the National Information and Communication Technology Australia (NICTA) research centre in Sydney, Australia. There, with the help of government funding, the team spent three years developing the foundations of Dante. In 2006, Williams founded Audinate and began the process of bringing Dante to the market. Audinate received funding from NICTA until negotiations concluded in 2006, at which point Audinate became NICTA's first successful spin-out company. Since 2006, Audinate has also secured two rounds of A$4 million investments led by venture capital firms Starfish Ventures and Innovation Capital. In 2009, Audinate established an office in Portland, Oregon and named Lee Ellison as CEO. Audinate also has offices in London and Hong Kong. Since its founding, Audinate has licensed 350 companies, which have produced 1000 products that incorporate Dante technology. Platforms Audinate offers Dante technology on a number of hardware and software platforms. *Virtual soundcard - software interface for PC and Mac *Brooklyn II - medium channel count module, Gigabit Ethernet *Ultimo - low channel count microcontroller, Fast Ethernet *Dante HC - high channel count FPGA, Gigabit Ethernet *Broadway - low channel count FPGA, Gigabit Ethernet NotesReferences External links  * Category:Digital audio Category:Audio network protocols Category:Ethernet ","title":"Dante (networking)"},{"id":"25832423","text":"Howellanthus is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the borage family containing the single species Howellanthus dalesianus, commonly known as Scott Mountain phacelia or Howell's phacelia. Until 2010 the plant was known as Phacelia dalesiana.Walden, G. K. and R. Patterson. (2010). Howellanthus dalesianus, Recognition of a new genus and species in Tribe Phacelieae (Boraginaceae). Madro√±o 57:4 268-273. It is endemic to the southern Klamath Mountains of northern California, including the Scott Mountains for which it is named. It grows in mountain forests and meadows. Description Phacelia dalesiana is a perennial herb producing a few decumbent stems up to about 15 centimeters long, forming a patch on the ground. It is glandular and hairy in texture. The leaves are located in a rosette, with a few smaller ones along the stems. They are oval and smooth-edged. The inflorescence is a small curving cluster of flowers each just under a centimeter wide. The flower is white with small purple streaks at the throat. There are five protruding stamens tipped with large purple anthers. It blooms between May and August, the timing dependent on snowmelt. Ecology The plant is a paleoendemic, its morphology unique among the phacelias, and probably a relict persisting in areas of ultramafic rock substrate in a small section of the Siskiyou-Trinity Mountains. Taxonomy The new name honors botanist John Thomas Howell and his friend, plant collector Ella Dales Miles Cantelow. The type location is the summit of Scott Mountain in Trinity County, California, near California State Route 3 and the Pacific Crest Trail, the type locality for many species of rare endemic plants.

He wrote two volumes of the official British History of the Second World War; \\"Grand Strategy\\" Volumes V and VI. The son of Albert Ehrman, John Ehrman was educated at Charterhouse School and Trinity College, Cambridge, when the outbreak of war in 1939 interrupted his studies. Ehrman served in the Royal Navy in the Middle East and the Atlantic. He returned to Trinity College after the war and his work gained him the admiration of G. M. Trevelyan and George Clark. He was elected to a Fellowship in 1947. In 1948 Ehrman married a daughter of Vice-Admiral Sir Geoffrey Blake and they had four sons. J. R. M. Butler, who had been Ehrman's tutor and was the leading spirit behind Britain's official History of the Second World War, chose Ehrman to write the fifth and sixth volumes on Grand Strategy for the series. These were published in 1956 and were well received. Ehrman also wrote The Atomic Bomb (1953), where he explained Britain's involvement in the making and use of the atomic weapon. Due to the classified information it contained, the book was not published until the early 1990s. In 1957 he delivered the Lees Knowles Lectures at Cambridge. From 1960 until 1977 he was Treasurer of the Friends of the National Libraries, where he oversaw its growth from a small group to a national institution. From 1971 until 1965 he was a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery and he served on the Committee on the Export of Works of Art from 1970 until 1976. He was also a member of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts from 1976 until 1994 and he ran the National Manuscripts Conservation Trust from 1989 to 1994. He was also twice vice- president of the Navy Records Society. In 1970 he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy. His three volume biography of Pitt the Younger is a huge work of scholarship, amounting to around 300,000 words of text and 150,000 words of footnotes.

Development  Prior to its completion in 1965, the Rutgers Houses was one of the sites of a city-wide civil rights protests in 1963. Demonstrators attempted to block construction until African Americans and Latinos get more jobs in the building trades until several were taken into custody. While not in opposition to the protests, construction crews at the development site were reported to have said they were more integrated than most. Designed by Hart, Jerman & Associates, the Rutgers Houses in 1961, the development was completed March 31, 1965. Pelham Street, which ran between Pike Street and Rutgers Street, was taken off maps of the area about 1960 for the construction of the development. The development is named after Henry Rutgers (1745‚Äì1830), a captain in the American Revolutionary War and a major landowner and philanthropist who was the last descendant of Dutch immigrants. Henry Rutgers' farm, the \\"Bouwery\\", made up most of the Lower East Side around Chinatown, and later gave large sections of his farm to churches and the development is on a part of the former farm site.

During World War I he was a flying ace credited with 15 aerial victories. He remained in RAF service until retiring in 1941. Biography=Early life and education He was born Harry King, in Handsworth, Staffordshire, the son of Florence Annie King, a dressmaker, but was adopted by Thomas and Margaret Goode of Ryton, Bulkington, Warwickshire. He attended a local school, and in 1907 was offered a scholarship from the local education authority, on condition he serve as a student teacher for not less than a year on completion of his studies. He entered King Edward VI Free Grammar School in Nuneaton on 16 September 1907, and in 1912 was awarded a Cambridge local honours degree. However, having spent time as a student teacher in Nuneaton and Rugby, he decided against a teaching career, and instead took a job at Alfred Herbert's making machine tools. World War I Goode joined the army soon after the outbreak of World War I, enlisting in the Royal Engineers on 8 September 1914. He served in France for two years, from July 1915 to July 1917, mainly as a motorcycle dispatch rider, and also gained promotion to corporal. In late 1917 he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, starting his flight training at the No. 2 School of Military Aeronautics in Oxford on 21 September as a cadet, and was appointed a probationary second lieutenant on 8 November. In late November he was posted to No. 5 Training Squadron at Castle Bromwich, and in January 1918 to No. 63 Training Squadron at RAF Joyce Green, near Dartford, Kent, for advanced flying training. Goode was confirmed in his rank of second lieutenant on 8 April, just over a week after the Army's Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) had been merged to form the Royal Air Force. In early May he was sent to the No. 2 School of Aerial Fighting and Gunnery in Marske, Yorkshire, to complete his training. On 27 May Goode was posted to \\"C\\" Flight, No. 66 Squadron, flying the Sopwith Camel on the Italian Front, flying his first combat patrol on the 30th. On 25 June he claimed his first victory; an Albatros C shot down south of Asiago, then on 18 July an Albatros D.III during a mel√©e over Cesuna. On 1 August he shot down a Roland C, which crashed near Guistina, and 5 August claimed his first kite balloon, which went down in flames south-east of Oderzo. On 9 August he shot down a Brandenberg C north of Motta, and on the 11th claimed an Albatros D.III over Valpegara. On 22 August he shot down another D.III in flames over Conegliano. After a month's leave in England Goode returned to active duty in late September and shot down an LVG C north-east of Conegliano on the 29th. On 8 October he shot down a Roland C south west of Vado, his last victory against an enemy aircraft, as all his remaining victories were against balloons. On 22 October Goode and Captain Harold Hindle-James attacked a balloon south-west of Vazzolo, which burst into flames. Goode was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross following this action, which was gazetted on 3 December. Goode destroyed another balloon on 27 October, and two on the 28th, being appointed an acting-captain the same day. On 29 October he took part in an early morning bombing raid against an artillery position, then strafed the aerodrome at Stradatta, destroying another balloon on the ground, and making further attacks on ground troops. At 10:00 he took part in an attack on a train near Pianzano. On his third patrol of the day Goode first took part in an attack on enemy troops moving east on the Vittorio‚ÄìCordignano road, and then on the aerodrome at San Giacomo, strafing parked aircraft and the hangars, before harassing horse transports and other targets. Goode returned to San Giacomo later in the day to make further low level attacks. For his actions on this day he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 5 November 1918, which was gazetted on 8 February 1919. On 30 October Goode's flight overflew San Giacomo aerodrome, which had been destroyed by the enemy and evacuated. Later in the day they bombed a group of horse transports and light guns on the Fontanafredda‚ÄìSacile road before landing at San Giacomo to inspect the wreckage. Goode was slightly wounded in the face on 1 November, but pressed on with his attack regardless. Over the next few days Goode flew several patrols a day as the Austrians fell back in disarray. Finally, on 4 November, the armistice of Villa Giusti brought the war between Italy and Austria to a close. No. 66 Squadron remained in Italy for another four months, until finally returning to England in February 1919. It was initially based at RAF Yatesbury, then at Leighterton in Gloucestershire. Goode briefly served as Officer Commanding, but on 21 April he crashed an Avro 504 at Leighterton. His observer was killed, but Goode escaped with a broken wrist. This would be Goode's last flight with No. 66 Squadron, with which he had made 177 flights, 134 of them operational, for a total of almost 325 flying hours. He was credited with eight enemy aircraft and seven balloons (more than any other RAF pilot on the Italian front), for a total of fifteen aerial victories. No. 66 Squadron was finally disbanded on 25 October. Inter war career Goode remained in service with the RAF following the end of the war, and was granted a permanent commission as a lieutenant on 1 August 1919. He was posted to the Aircraft Depot, India, on 29 July 1923, returning to the Home Establishment on 15 February 1924. He was posted to the No. 1 School of Technical Training RAF, based at RAF Halton, on 7 May 1924, transferring to No. 2 Flying Training School at RAF Digby on 8 September. On 16 January 1925 Goode was again sent overseas, to serve at No. 4 Flying Training School in Egypt, then served in the Aden Flight from 19 November. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 July 1926. Goode was serving in No. 45 Squadron RAF in Egypt in 1927 when he met Ena Marshall Scales, a teacher from Bosham, Hampshire, who was on a sight-seeing trip to the pyramids. They were married at Bosham on 2 February 1930. Their only child was born in November 1930, but died after two weeks. On 29 December 1929 Goode was posted to the Station Headquarters at RAF North Weald, Essex, and on 9 July 1931 to No. 502 (Ulster) Squadron based at RAF Aldergrove in Northern Ireland. No. 502 was a \\"cadre squadron\\" which was composed of two flights; one of regular officers, the other of part-time civilian \\"special reserve\\" personnel . The squadron operated as a night bombing unit and each flight was equipped with four Vickers Virginia heavy bombers and one Avro Tutor for flying training. Goode was posted to Station Headquarters, RAF Hendon on 21 November 1934. He was promoted to squadron leader on 1 December 1935, taking command of No. 24 (Communications) Squadron, which provided VIP air transport. Goode was promoted to wing commander on 1 November 1938, and was awarded the Air Force Cross on 2 January 1939. In April 1939 he flew General Viscount Gort, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on an inspection tour of the Maginot Line. World War II On 1 March 1941 Goode was promoted to group captain, and commanded No. 60 Operational Training Unit from late April. Having twice extended his period of service Goode finally resigned his commission on 15 December 1941, and joined the Air Ministry's Accidents Investigation Branch. Death Goode was killed on 21 August 1942, while flying as a passenger aboard an RAF Consolidated Liberator Mk. III. The No. 120 Squadron aircraft had taken off from RAF Nutts Corner, Northern Ireland, on a test flight in heavy mist and subsequently crashed into a hill, Big Trosk Mountain, near Carnlough with the loss of all aboard. He is buried at Tamlaght Finlagan churchyard, Ballykelly, County Londonderry. Honours and awards ;Distinguished Service Order :2nd Lieutenant (Acting Captain) Harry King Goode, DFC. (Italy) ::During the recent operations this officer has displayed magnificent courage and determination in attacking enemy aerodromes, kite balloons and retreating columns, inflicting very heavy loss. On 29 October he led two other machines in a bombing raid against an enemy aerodrome; he completely destroyed with a bomb, one hostile machine on the ground; and, attacking the hangars and workshops with machine-gun fire, he caused many casualties amongst the mechanics. Later on in the same day he returned alone to attack the same aerodrome, and found the enemy about to evacuate it. Flying at a very low altitude‚Äîat times his wheels almost touched the ground‚Äîhe destroyed one machine with a bomb and set fire to another with machine-gun fire. The enemy personnel were driven back into the village by the vigour of his attack. Captain Goode's utter disregard of personal danger inspired all who served with him. ;Distinguished Flying Cross :2nd Lieutenant (Acting Captain) Harry King Goode.

Unlike the Sabot, the Holdfast Trainer has both a main and a jib in order to facilitate a two-person crew and to teach jib handling.

It was written by show co-producers Dylan Morgan and Josh Siegal, and directed by Gail Mancuso. It originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on November 19, 2009. Guest stars in this episode include Nate Corddry, Al Gore, Marceline Hugot, Chris Parnell, Bobb'e J. Thompson, and Tony Torn. In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) puts NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) in charge of reducing the fictional sketch comedy show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan's (TGS) carbon footprint. Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) learns her apartment is becoming a condominium and tries to kick out the resident above her (Corddry). At the same time, Jack and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) reevaluate fatherhood. \\"Sun Tea\\" received generally mixed reviews from television critics. According to the Nielsen ratings system, the episode was watched by 5.858 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 2.9 rating/7 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Plot Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) learns that her apartment building is being converted into a condominium and is told that she must purchase her apartment or face a rent increase. She decides that she wants to buy her apartment and the one above her, and turn them into her dream home. When she learns that her neighbor, Brian (Nate Corddry), will not be bribed out of his apartment, she agrees to move in with him, seemingly to save money, hoping to drive him out with her behavior. At work, Liz is disgusted by her staff writer, Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) peeing in bottles to stop global warming. However, she decides to adopt this behavior to force Brian to leave; she is successful. At the same time, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tells his boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), the negative impact fatherhood has had on his life. They both decide to get vasectomies from Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell). While waiting, Jack discovers the respect Tracy's son, Tracy Jr. (Bobb'e J. Thompson), has for his father. After being put under, Tracy realizes his life is horrible because he does not have a daughter. Luckily, Jack is able to stop Dr. Spaceman before he conducts the procedure. Meanwhile, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) is put in charge of reducing TGS with Tracy Jordan's carbon footprint. He argues that Frank's habits, albeit disgusting, are actually environmentally friendly. Kenneth gets advice from former Vice President of the United States Al Gore, who tells him to recycle everything \\"including jokes\\". At that point, Gore declares that a whale is in trouble and runs off. Production \\"Sun Tea\\" was written by show co-producers Dylan Morgan and Josh Siegal, and directed by Gail Mancuso. This episode was the first writing credit for both Morgan and Siegal, and Mancuso's eighth directed 30 Rock episode. Morgan and Siegal, along with series producer Paula Pell, would later collaborate on the episode \\"Argus\\", that aired in the show's fourth season on April 29, 2010. \\"Sun Tea\\" originally aired on November 19, 2009, on NBC in the United States as the sixth episode of the show's fourth season. Former Vice President Al Gore made his second appearance as himself on 30 Rock in this episode. This episode aired as part of Green Week, an initiative introduced by NBC's Chief Executive Jeff Zucker which included having every primetime program which aired between November 15 and November 22, 2009, contain some sort of positive environmental theme. Jack McBrayer, who plays NBC page Kenneth Parcell, in regards to the environmental theme, said \\"It's something that is relatable and is something that a lot of people are doing. Everybody is on board with greening up the place and being more environmentally friendly in real life. Every now and then people need to be reminded of things that can be done.\\" \\"Sun Tea\\" was filmed on October 23 Save Picture as ‚Üí Right click file ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Summary ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Date Picture Taken and November 10, 2009. Save Picture as ‚Üí Right click file ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Summary ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Date Picture Taken In October 2009, it was confirmed that actor Nate Corddry, best known as the brother of a former correspondent on the late night satirical television program The Daily Show, would guest star on the show as Liz Lemon's upstairs neighbor. Former Vice President of the United States Al Gore made his second guest appearance, playing himself, with this episode. Gore first appeared in season two episode \\"Greenzo\\". Actress Marceline Hugot reprised her role as Kathy Geiss, the daughter of Don Geiss (Rip Torn), for the eighth time. Don Geiss's estranged son, Bertrum (Tony Torn), sues Kathy for control of the Geiss family trust fund. It is later revealed that Kathy is being represented by Teddy Ruxpin. Comedian actor Chris Parnell, who played Dr. Leo Spaceman in this episode, has appeared in the main cast of Saturday Night Live (SNL), a weekly sketch comedy series which airs on NBC in the United States. Series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey was the head writer on SNL from 1999 until 2006. This episode was actor Bobb'e J. Thompson's third appearance as Tracy Jordan's son, Tracy Jr., on the show. Thompson first guest starred in the episodes \\"Gavin Volure\\" and \\"The Bubble\\". The character Astronaut Mike Dexter was first referenced in this episode, in which Liz considers him to be her imaginary perfect husband. In \\"Sun Tea\\", \\"Dot Com\\" Slattery (Kevin Brown) pretends to be Mike Dexter, Liz's \\"crazy black boyfriend\\", to help her get Brian out of his apartment. In the following episode, \\"Dealbreakers Talk Show\\", actor John Anderson played the character, when Liz fantasizes about what it would be like following the success of her talk show, and is then notified by Mike Dexter that he has to go back to outer space. Astronaut Mike Dexter would be mentioned further in the season. One filmed scene from \\"Sun Tea\\" was cut out from the airing. Instead, the scene was included on 30 Rocks season four DVD as part of the deleted scenes bonus feature. Frank Rossitano is told to stop peeing in jars in his office and forced to use the bathroom. After exiting a bathroom in the 30 Rock building Frank runs into Kenneth and tells him \\"They can make me use the bathroom, Kenneth, but they will NEVER stop me from eating food in the garbage.\\" Frank then sees a janitors cart and picks up a half-eaten egg muffin, eats it, and goes through the garbage in search for more food. Cultural references * In one scene of \\"Sun Tea\\", Jack Donaghy reveals that Don Geiss's son, Bertram, is suing his half-sister, Kathy, for control of the Geiss family trust fund. Kathy, who is outside of court and interviewed by the news media, is being represented by Teddy Ruxpin, an animatronic talking bear, who is dressed in a suit. * When Liz learns from Kenneth that NBC will have Green Week, she says \\"Oh brother, are they actually going to do something this year or are they just going to put that stupid green peacock in the corner of the screen?\\", a reference to the NBC peacock symbol having a green logo design during Green Week. As a result of what Liz said, Kenneth breaks the fourth wall, a term used when a character in a television show, film or on stage directly addresses the audience, when he glances down at the logo. * Tracy, under anesthetic for his vasectomy operation, dreams that he is playing actor Bill Cosby's television character Cliff Huxtable and Tracy Jr. is Theo Huxtable from the television situation comedy The Cosby Show. * Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) admits to Kenneth she once took a low-volume shower with actor Ed Begley Jr., and said \\"What more can I do?\\", after Kenneth told her he was in charge of reducing TGS's carbon footprint, and that everyone has to help with this. This is a reference to Begley's environmental activism. * At the end, when Al Gore says \\"Quiet! A whale is in trouble. I have to go!\\", he repeats a line from season two episode \\"Greenzo\\", in which he also guest starred. Reception According to the Nielsen ratings system, \\"Sun Tea\\" was watched by 5.858 million households in its original American broadcast. It earned a 2.9 rating/7 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 2.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year- olds, and 7 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. It constituted a three percent drop in viewership from the previous week's episode, \\"The Problem Solvers\\". During its original broadcast, \\"Sun Tea\\" ranked third in its 9:30 p.m. slot, behind CBS' CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, which drew 15.064 million household viewers, and ABC's Grey's Anatomy, which drew 14.300 million households. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger was positive about the episode, writing \\"This was the strongest overall Thursday this season for NBC's comedies, and 'Sun Tea' brought the evening to a fine close. Not all of it worked, but enough of it did ... that I was left happy.\\" He opined that if the episode gave more time to Kathy being represented by Teddy Ruxpin \\"I would have given 'Sun Tea' my stamp of approval\\". In regards to the environment story, Sepinwall said it \\"tied in nicely with both Frank's disgusting jars and the apartment plot\\". Nick Catucci of New York magazine said that the episode was \\"chockablock with great mini-sketches, gags, and flights of fancy.\\" Catucci enjoyed Tracy's Cosby dream, while he was anesthetized, calling it \\"delightful\\". The A.V. Club's Steven Hyden enjoyed the episode, writing it was \\"one of the funniest and most enjoyable episodes of the season.\\" Hyden commented that Liz's plot had \\"a string of craaazy jokes. But they were amusing to laugh-out-loud jokes.\\" \\"I wouldn't claim that it was an absolutely top tier episode [...] but what the hell, it had some pretty great moments\\", said Sean Gandert for Paste magazine. Gandert enjoyed Jack/Tracy and Liz's plots, respectively, was glad that Chris Parnell returned as Dr. Spaceman, and said that Gore \\"also rarely disappoints\\", but was not complimentary towards NBC \\"[shoehorning] its green week thing\\" into \\"Sun Tea\\". Time contributor James Poniewozik observed that \\"the best bits\\" from this episode were \\"Teddy Ruxpin the lawyer; the declaration that 'I, Bertram Geiss, am still Daddy's fancy boy'; and, especially, the show's treatment of the Green Is Universal mandate.\\" Not all reviews were positive. IGN contributor Robert Canning did not enjoy the green theme in the episode, reasoning that it \\"just seemed to get in the way of everything else happening in 'Sun Tea'.\\" He was not thrilled with Jack and Tracy's storyline, noting it was missing heart and emotion, and overall it felt \\"flat\\". Canning felt that Al Gore's cameo was \\"fun but wholly unnecessary.\\" Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad gave \\"Sun Tea\\" a mixed review, noting \\"I don't know how funny it was, though. I mean, sure, there was still a ton of great lines tonight ... but not all of them hit the mark like they usually do.\\" Nonetheless, Sassone concluded \\"...any 30 Rock episode with Dr. Spaceman and a couple of digs at NBC's Green Week is still a pretty good one.\\" Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, said this episode of 30 Rock was \\"even more of a comedy drag race than usual.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:30 Rock (season 4) episodes Category:2009 American television episodes Category:Al Gore ","title":"Sun Tea (30 Rock)"},{"id":"25833106","text":"Fertile Crescent; the Levantine corridor is by the sea Layer sequence at Ksar Akil in the Levantine corridor, and discovery of two fossils of Homo sapiens, dated to 40,800 to 39,200 years BP for \\"Egbert\\",and 42,400‚Äì41,700 BP for \\"Ethelruda\\".. The Levantine corridor is the relatively narrow strip between the Mediterranean Sea to the northwest and deserts to the southeast which connects Africa to Eurasia.

These movements were created around certain beliefs that were unorthodox and not held by the mainstream Shia Muslims. These movements eventually after their very brief existence had their followers fall into mainstream Islam. Ghulat sects * Bazighiyya- who believed that Ja'far al-Sadiq was God. * Dhammiyya- who believed that Ali was God and Muhammad was his appointed Messenger and Prophet. * Ghurabiyya- who believed the angel Gabriel was mistaken. * Hurufiyya- who believed God is incarnated in every atom, reminiscent of the Alevi-Bektashism. ** Nuqtavi- who believed in a cyclical view of time, reminiscent of the Isma'ili Shia. * Kaysanites- who believed in the Imamate of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah after the death of Husayn Ibn 'Ali Ibn abu Talib. ** Bayaniyya- the followers of BayƒÅn al-Nahdi, who believed that Abu Hashim was a prophet and would return to rule the world as Mahdi. BayƒÅn claimed prophethood for himself after the demise of Abu Hashim, as well. ** Harbiyya- the followers of  øAbd AllƒÅh ibn al-Harb ibn al-Kindi, who initially taught antinomianism then joined Ibn Mu'awiya's party and later expressed many extremist views about him. Furthermore, Ibn al-Harb introduced some fundamental doctrines including metempsychosis, cyclical history of eras and aeons into the radical branch of Shi'ism. The group claimed that Abu Hashim designated Ibn Mu'awiya as his successor Imam of Hashimiyya. *** Riyahiyya- Harbiyya and pro-Abbasid Hashimiyya disputed over Abu Hashim's will about the imamate and eventually the disputed parties agreed upon the arbitration of their respected leader Abu Riyah, who decided that the imamate should remain in Abbasids. The most of the followers of Harbiyya, who had previously recognized Ibn Mu'awiya as their imam, seceded and joined to the Abbasid party and they had been called Riyahiyya. Those who stayed in Harbiyya and continued to recognize the imamete of Ibn Mu'awiya subsequently called as Janahiyya. *** Janahiyya- the followers of  øAbd AllƒÅh ibn Mu'awiya ibn  øAbd AllƒÅh ibn Ja'far, who was a descendant of Ja'far ibn Abi Talib known as Dhu'l-Janahayn, believed incarnation of God in a succession of Prophets and imams passing eventually through Ibn al-hanafiya and Abu Hashim to Ibn Mu'awiya; transmigration of the souls; and the allegorical interpretation of the Quran. * Mughiriyya- who influenced by Mandean and Manichean doctrines, founded by the first Shi'i gnostic al-Mughira, who claimed that God is a man of light with a crown of light on his head resembling Mandean doctrine of deity referred to as \\"king of light\\". Al-Mughira further added that God has limbs corresponding to the letters of Arabic alphabet reminiscent of the teaching of Marcus the Gnostic. * Rawendis- who believed in the transmigration of souls. They asserted that the spirit that was in Jesus was in Ali, and the spirit of Adam was in Othman ibn Nahik. * Soldiers of Heaven- who believed that their former leader Dia Abdul Zahra Kadim (died 2007 CE) was the Mahdi and reincarnation of Ali ibn Abi Talib. * Ya‚Äôfuriyya- who believed in reincarnation and that a man named Mu‚Äôammar al-Kufi was their Lord. Zaydi Shia sects *Mutrafya A Hamdani based sect of the Zaydi Shia led Mutraf bin Shihab that start gaining followers in Yemen after the fall of the Ismaili Zurayids, they were weakened by Sunni Ayyubids & later famously exterminated as heretics by the Zaydi imam Al-Mansur Abdallah for calling for backing a Hamdani imam *Dukayniyya- who believed Muhammad‚Äôs followers fell into unbelief after his death because they did not uphold the Imamate of Ali. *Jarudiyah- who believed the companions were sinful in failing to recognise Ali as the legitimate Caliph. They became extinct in Iran and Iraq but still survive in Yemen under the Hadawi sub-sect. *Khalafiyya- who believed in a unique line of Imams after Zayd ibn Ali ibn Husayn Ibn 'Ali Ibn abu Talib, starting with a man named Abd al-Samad and continuing with his descendants. *Khashabiyya- who believed that the Imamate must remain only among the descendants of Hasan and Husayn, even if that Imam is ignorant, immoral and tyrannical. *Tabiriyya/Butriyya/Salihiyya- who believed the companions, including Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman, had been in error in failing to follow Ali, but it did not amount to sin. Imami/pre-Twelver Shia sects *Fathites- who believed Abdullah al-Aftah was the succeeding Imam after his father Ja'far al-Sadiq's death. *Muhammadites- who believed that Muhammad ibn Ali al Hadi was the true 11th Imam, rather than Hasan al-Askari. *Tawussites- who believed that Ja'far al-Sadiq was the Mahdi and that he was alive and did not die. *Waqifites- who believed in the Imamate of Musa al-Kadhim but refused to accept the Imamate of his successor Ali ar-Ridha. *Musha'sha'iyyah- founded and led by Muhammad ibn Falah, an Iraqi-born theologian who believed himself to be the earthly representative of Ali and the Mahdi. IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´ Shia sects *Hafizi- who believed the Caliph of the Fatimid Caliphate, Al Hafiz and his descendants were also the Imam of the Time. * Seveners-believed that Isma'il ibn Jafar was the seventh and the last Imam (hereditary leader of the Muslim community in the direct line of Ali). They believed his son, Muhammad ibn Isma'il, would return and bring about an age of justice as Mahdi. * Qarmatians- a sect of Seveners who believed in a world view where every phenomenon repeated itself in cycles, where every incident was replayed over and over again.

Life The Blowing up of the French Commander's Ship \\"L'Orient\\" at the Battle of the Nile, 1798 John Thomas Serres was born in London in December 1759 to Dominic Serres, a prominent painter and a founder of the Royal Academy. Instructed by his father, John was involved in the publication of the maritime painter's guide Liber Nauticus and the younger Serres had soon developed a successful independent painting career, the Royal Academy and British Institution exhibiting over 100 of his paintings over his lifetime. He also became Master of Drawing at the Royal Naval College in Chelsea and in 1793 was made Marine Painter to the King after his father's death. Serres' successful career was badly damaged in the early 19th century by the activities of his wife Olivia Serres, who came to believe that she was the illegitimate daughter of the Duke of Cumberland and publicly pressed her \\"claim\\" to his estate, insisting on being addressed as \\"Princess Olive of Cumberland\\". Consequently, out of favour at court, Serres was forced to attempt to recoup his losses by investing in the theatre, setting up the Royal Coburg Theatre in 1818 that eventually became known as the \\"Old Vic\\". However his wife's activities again ruined him and he died in December 1825 in a London debtors' prison. His daughter Lavinia Ryves spent most of her life continuing to unsuccessfully press her mother's \\"claim\\" on the estate of King George III, even managing to take it to the House of Lords.

Below is a stylized representation of Mary's Tomb, with flowers lying on the sarcophagus. The Cincture of the Theotokos is an alleged relic of the Theotokos (Blessed Virgin Mary), now in the Vatopedi monastery on Mount Athos, which is venerated by some members of the Orthodox Church. The word \\"cincture\\" (Greek: zone) is sometimes also translated as \\"belt\\", \\"sash\\" or \\"girdle\\". It is the Orthodox equivalent of the Girdle of Thomas in the Western church, and the Syriac Holy Girdle. Tradition According to the Sacred Tradition of the Orthodox Church, at the time of her Dormition, the Theotokos was buried by the Twelve Apostles in Jerusalem. Three days later, Thomas the Apostle, who had been delayed and unable to attend the funeral, arrived and asked to have one last look at the Virgin Mary. When he and the other apostles arrived at Mary's Tomb, they found that her body was missing. According to some accounts, the Virgin Mary appeared at that time and gave her belt (cincture) to the Apostle Thomas. There is no scriptural evidence for this event, nor is the relic the subject of any pronouncement by the Ecumenical Councils or the Holy Fathers. Its history prior to the reign of Justinian in the sixth century is unknown. Traditionally, the cincture was made by the Virgin Mary herself, out of camelhair. It was kept at Jerusalem for many years, until it was translated to Constantinople in the 5th century, together with the Robe of the Virgin Mary, and deposited in the Church of St. Mary at Blachernae. This relic was embroidered with gold thread by the Empress Zoe, the wife of Emperor Leo VI, in gratitude for a miraculous cure. Placing of the Cincture Placing of the Cincture of the Most Holy Theotokos (Russian icon) During the reign of Emperor Manuel I Komninos (1143‚Äì1180) in the 12th century, an official feast day for the cincture was established on August 31 on the Orthodox liturgical calendar. Later, the Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos (1347‚Äì1355) donated the cincture to the Holy Great Monastery of Vatopedi on Mount Athos,\\"The Placing of the Cincture (Sash) of the Most Holy Mother of God\\", Orthodox church in America where it remains to this day, in a silver reliquary of newer manufacture which depicts the Monastery. Public veneration In 2011, pilgrims gather in Ekaterinburg to venerate the Cincture of the Virgin Mary exposed at the city's Trinity Cathedral In the fall of 2011, the venerated object was brought to Russia to allow Russian Orthodox Christian pilgrims to reverence it in different cities. In St.Petersburg it attracted a 2 km-long line of people to the Resurrection Nunnery on Moskovsky Prospect virtually blocking automotive traffic on adjacent streets, totalling 200 thousand, with Vladimir Putin being among the first ones. The second city was Yekaterinburg where about 150,000 people from nearby territories came, including regional governor Alexander Misharin. n:ru:–ö –ü–æ—è—Å—É –ë–æ–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∏—Ü—ã –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–∏–ª–∏—Å—å 150 —Ç—ã—Å—è—á —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫ –≤ –ï–∫–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–±—É—Ä–≥–µ –∏ —á–µ—Ç–≤–µ—Ä—Ç—å –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –¢–∞–π–º—ã—Ä–∞ ‚Äî Russian Wikinews report The next cities were Norilsk (50 thousand, a quarter of Taymyr Peninsula population) and Vladivostok, the further voyage is planned until the end of November.

It was built to designs by William Hague (c.1840-99), under the supervision of William Henry Byrne (1866‚Äì1917). Architecture The lack of ornamentation to the summit indicates that the additional stage and spire projected by Byrne in association with William Hogan was never executed.

Maeser Building, also known as the MSRB, is a building that houses classrooms, administrative offices, and an assembly hall for the Brigham Young University Honors Program on the university's campus in Provo, Utah. The building is named for Karl G. Maeser. Background The assembly room of the Maeser Building in 1911 Soon after the death of Karl G. Maeser in 1901, plans were begun to erect a fitting memorial to this great teacher. Ten years later the beautiful Maeser Memorial Building was completed. This graceful structure was the first permanent building on upper campus, then called Temple Hill. Designed originally as a classroom building, it has served thousands of students. But that has not been its only function. For a while, the spacious 175-seat assembly hall, occupying the central portion of the third and fourth floors, was used for college devotionals, and for forty years it served also for faculty meetings. Briefly, in 1918, the building housed a unit of the Student Army Training Corps. In 1921 the Maeser Building became the first home of the newly organized College of Commerce and Business Administration which, for the next thirteen years, occupied most of the building, except for part of the first floor, where the Purchasing Department, under the direction of Kiefer B. Sauls, was housed. In 1931 the offices of the University president and other administrators were moved from lower campus to the Maeser Building. Two years later the BYU Press began its operation in the south end of the first floor, directly under President Franklin S. Harris's office. Before moving out in 1947, the press had occupied the entire first floor. For sixteen years the administrative offices shared the third floor with the campus telephone switchboard. In the 1950s the Maeser Building assembly hall was dismantled. A partial floor was built across the second story, and the historic hall was chopped into temporary offices to help alleviate the growing pressure for office space as the University population exploded following World War II. Upon completion of the Abraham O. Smoot Building in 1961, the administration moved out and the Archaeology and English Departments moved in, the former to the first floor and the latter to the second and third. The Department of English stayed only two years, then History occupied the northern half and Political Science the southern. This arrangement lasted for the next fourteen years, until the French and Italian Department moved into the suites vacated by History, and the German Department took those left by Political Science. Between 1981 and 1983, Anthropology-Archaeology and the two language departments also left the building. With the decision of the administration and Board of Trustees to restore the Maeser Building to its original classical dignity, and to make it the center for the University Honors Program, a complete renovation was carried out. The Honors Program came into being to provide capable and motivated students with an enriched education. The first quarter century of the program's operation witnessed numerous administrative adjustments and curriculum changes in order to help fulfill Karl G. Maeser's vision of this hill covered with temples of learning. Making the Maeser Building a home for the Honors Program is another appropriate tribute to the memory of Karl G. Maeser.

In January 2016 he served as the host of the National Geographic Explorer television show, Call of the Wild, which explored how screens are screwing with our brains and how nature can be restorative. In October 2013, he appeared on MSNBC‚Äôs The Cycle to offer his take on the anniversary of Hurricane Sandy. His video, \\"Skiing the Beach,\\" has now been watched by almost 18,000 YouTube viewers. Literary works In 1997, Gessner published A Wild, Rank Place, a short memoir about spending a year on Cape Cod and tending to his father while he died of cancer. The book subverted the typical Thoreauvian year-in-the-woods theme with its dark themes and blunt language. This was followed by Under the Devil‚Äôs Thumb, a collection of essays about an Easterner‚Äôs years spent in the West, years made more vital and radiant by the author‚Äôs own recovery from testicular cancer. Since 2001, Gessner has published seven more books that combine memoir with humor and observations of the natural world, beginning with Return of the Osprey, in 2001. The Boston Globe and Book of the Month Club both chose Osprey as one of the top ten nonfiction books of 2001, the Globe calling it a \\"classic of American Nature Writing.\\" In 2003, Gessner published Sick of Nature. Sick of Nature has been much-anthologized and taught at MIT and Harvard University and many other colleges. Of Sick of Nature, renowned eco-critic Michael Branch wrote, \\"Gessner has positioned himself as a sort of Woody Allen of environmental writers\\" and \\"like Emerson, who observed that the dead forms of institutional practice must be revivified through radical acts of intellectual, aesthetic and moral imagination, Gessner rails against the narrowness of environmental literature to open the field to new (if less earnest) approaches.\\" This was followed by The Prophet of Dry Hill, which described a series of encounters with the great nature writer John Hay. In Soaring with Fidel, released in April 2007, Gessner continued to push the nature genre, following the entire 7,000 mile migration of ospreys from New England to Cuba and Venezuela.

The first official protest associated with Redwood Summer took place in June 1990 at the Louisiana Pacific export dock in Samoa California. Before the protests officially started, the campaign gained international attention on May 24, 1990 when the campaign leader, Judi Bari, and a fellow activist, Darryl Cherney, were involved in a pipe bomb explosion that critically injured them while they were driving through Oakland, California. The explosion led to the FBI accusing Bari of manufacturing and transporting bombs. Due to the FBI not being able to adequately support their claims, she was eventually found innocent. The movement was also known to use many controversial techniques to disrupt the logging companies including tree spiking, symbolic protests, and disarming machinery. Though the protests were supposed to remain non-violent, many critics argue that Earth First! is a radical group and the techniques used in the protests are debated.  The logging companies  The campaign of Redwood Summer was an environmental battle to save the old growth forests in Northern California due to the forests rapid depletion of about 95%. However, there were two big incidents that caused the Earth First! activist to act. The first incident was when the California elections were coming up, which, included the decision of if California Proposition 130 was to be passed or not. In the summer of 1990, logging companies feared of a new law passing in the upcoming November ballot that would make the restrictions tighter for logging practices of the old- growth forests. If Proposition 130 (Restrictions on Logging and Bonds for Forests) passed, it would mean that there would have been new restrictions on logging practices and sale of timber. It would have also authorized the sale of $742 million in bonds to acquire forestlands and for compensation of timber employees. The organizers of Earth First! predicted that the timber companies would increase their logging significantly in the summer in order to get as much timber as possible before the November 1990 ballot. In the end, however, Proposition 130 did not pass. The second incident that made environment activists act was when the news of Louisiana Pacific Lumber Company being bought out by Maxxam Inc. was made public. After the company was purchased, they publicized their plan to increase their logging practices by doubling the rate of logging of the old growths forests due to the companies owner, Charles Hurwitz, being in debt after purchasing Louisiana Pacific with junk bonds. Many think that the increase of logging was so Hurwitz could try and get out of his debt. Earth First! response was to start Redwood Summer expose the big logging companies, making legislation make stricter laws about the logging of the old growth forests.  Bari and Cherney car bombing  On May 24, 1990, right before the kick off of Redwood Summer the campaign leader, Judi Bari, and a fellow activist, Darryl Cherney, were on their way to The Seeds of Peace House, an activist support group, in Oakland, California. While Bari was driving, a bomb underneath Bari's seat exploded. After the explosion, both were immediately transported to the hospital. Cherney had serious injuries to his face and obtained a broken wrist, while, Bari was in critical condition due to a shattered pelvis and internal injuries. She was also left permanently disabled due to the injuries she sustained. After the incident, both Bari and Cherney were charged with transporting an explosive device as the FBI and Oakland Police Department (OPD) claimed that both of the activists had knowledge of the bomb in the vehicle and the bomb accidentally exploded. After Cherney was treated, he was arrested at the hospital, while Bari stayed hospitalized due to her injuries. Both adamantly denied any knowledge or involvement in the bomb. Bari and Cherney claimed that they had received many death threats in the previous weeks making them believe that the bomb was an assassination attempt. Despite their claims, the FBI and OPD still pursued the criminal charges against the pair. Despite the accusations, the Redwood Summer campaign quickly gained national attention as the media frenzied around the details of the bombing and the accusations made against the activists. This made the campaign quickly gain recognition and momentum. Bari and Cherney's case eventually made it to trial where they were found not guilty due to the FBI not doing a proper investigation and having a lack of evidence. In the coming years and after both Bari and Cherney's names were cleared, they sued the FBI for violating their constitutional right. On June 11, 2002, roughly twelve years after the bombing, the jury found that the FBI unlawfully violated the pairs first and fourth amendment rights by arresting them, charging them, searching their homes, and the defamation of character. The jury awarded Darryl Cherney and the late Judi Bari $4.4 million.  Earth First! methods during Redwood Summer  During Redwood Summer, the Earth First! activists used a variety of methods, including standard protesting techniques, during the campaign. Earth First! activists claimed to be non violent, using civil and passive disobedient actions to save the Redwood Forests.  Tree spiking  One of the more controversial tactics that the activists used was tree spiking. Tree spiking was the act of inserting a metal spike in the base of a Redwood tree thus making it impossible for loggers to cut down the tree without damaging or destroying their equipment. However, one event made environmental groups, including Earth First!, denounce tree spiking. A factory worker was severely injured and almost lost his life due to the malfunctioning of the machine that he was using. The machine malfunctioned as a result of a spike still being imbedded in a piece of wood. After the incident, Earth First! declared that it would stop using tree spiking as means of disrupting the logging industry as it posed threats to human life.  Obstruction  On multiple occasions, the campaigners used obstructive practices to try to stop the destruction of the Redwood forests. In many instances, the activists chained themselves to trees, stood between bulldozers and trees, blocked trucks, and disabled machinery at night. On one occasion, forty-four activists were arrested in front of the main gate of the Louisiana- Pacific Pulp Mill in Samoa, California. On June 21, 1990, protestors blocked a logging truck that was carrying logged Redwoods resulting in the activists‚Äô arrests. After the arrests, however, about twenty other protestors climbed on top of one logging truck, which, blocked twenty-two other logging trucks, halting the production of the logging company.  Symbolic actions  A consistent tactic that the Earth First! protestors used against the loggers was symbolic actions. On many instances the protestors camouflaged themselves using nature, such as leaves and sticks, and sang Native American war cries. The protestors would also dress in animal costumes and, more particularly, wore costumes and patterns depicting that of the threatened spotted owl. The habitat of the threatened species was in the old growth forests, which, at the time, was threatened by the logging practices.  Tree-sitting  Tree- sitting was a strategy used to protect the trees that were marked to be logged down. Activists would camp in the old growth trees, sometimes for extended periods of times, to prevent the trees from being destroyed.  Timber company employees  Due to the protests, the logging practices and factory production slowed down and, sometimes, were at a stand still. The drop of profit made Louisiana-Pacific fire some of their employees, which, caused even greater tension between the Redwood Summer protestors and the employees of the timber companies. Not only did the employees fear losing their jobs, some employees stated that the actions of Earth First! against the logging industry tarnished their family legacy and some claimed that they feared going to work. The growing agitation between the environmentalist and the loggers caused confrontation between the two groups. There were instances where the activists said to have filed charges with the police because some loggers were hostile towards them. The protestors also report that workers threw rocks at them and one activist was hit with the handle of an axe. On another occasion, a logger severally beat an activist. At times, the protestors reported that some of the workers threw eggs at them, spat on them, and verbally threaten them. Despite this, however, protestors also report that many of the loggers they encountered disagreed with them, but were respectful and friendly. Some employees also admitted to fearing their job security due to the clear cutting of trees because if there are no trees left to log, they don't have a job.  After Redwood Summer  Though more attention has been brought to the depletion of the old-growth forests in California and more regulations are in place to protect the forests, the logging of the forests continue. Despite this, the Redwood Summer campaign gained international attention and made many people aware of the destruction of the old growth forests. Also, many activists are still focused on protecting the ancient trees, expanding the forests, and preserving what they can.

His particular area of expertise was Euphausiids or Krill, small shrimp-like creatures found in all the oceans of the world. Early life Brinton was born on January 12, 1924, in Richmond, Indiana to a Quaker couple, Howard Brinton and Anna Shipley Cox Brinton. Much of his childhood was spent on the grounds of Mills College where his mother was Dean of Faculty and his father was a professor. The family later moved to the Pendle Hill Quaker Center for Study and Contemplation, in Pennsylvania where his father and mother became directors. Academic career Brinton attended High School at Westtown School in Chester County, Pennsylvania. He studied at Haverford College and graduated in 1949 with a bachelor's degree in biology. He enrolled at Scripps Institution of Oceanography as a graduate student in 1950 and was awarded a Ph.D. in 1957. He continued on as a research biologist in the Marine Life Research Group, part of the CalCOFI program. He soon turned his dissertation into a major publication, The Distribution of Pacific Euphausiids.http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/3xq6r58k In this large monograph, he laid out the major biogeographic provinces of the Pacific (and part of the Atlantic), large-scale patterns of pelagic diversity and one of the most rational hypotheses for the mechanism of sympatric, oceanic speciation. In all of these studies the role of physical oceanography and circulation played a prominent part. His work has since been validated by others and continues, to this day, to form the basis for our attempts to understand large-scale pelagic ecology and the role of physics of the movement of water in the regulation of pelagic ecosystems. In addition to these studies he has led in the studies of how climatic variations have led to the large variations in the California Current, and its populations and communities. He has described several new species and, in collaboration with Margaret Knight, worked out the complicated life histories of many Euphausiid species. He received a formal tribute from the international GLOBEC program in 2009. He served as a major adviser and scientist for the State Department-sponsored Naga expeditions in the Gulf of Thailand and, later, as the curator of the UNESCO-sponsored Indian Ocean Biological Center in Cochin, India. He taught numerous students in both venues. His Academic career continued at Scripps until his retirement in the 1991. Family life Brinton met and married Desiree Ward in 1948. He had four children and was widowed in 1976. He remained unmarried until the time of his death. His primary residence was in La Jolla, California. He and his family lived in Bangkok, Thailand for a year in 1960, and in Kerala, India from 1965-1967. He died after a long illness on January 13, 2010.Obituary Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

The only species yet known is P. jugaliperforatus. Fossils of Piscogavialis have been found from the Mio-Pliocene Pisco Formation of the Sacaco Basin in southern Peru in 1998.Piscogavialis at Fossilworks.org It is the first reptile known from the formation, which is otherwise notable for its high diversity of fossil vertebrates. Piscogavialis is known only from a single specimen, but it represents some of the best preserved gavialid material known from South America. The skull is preserved in three dimensions and is nearly complete. A mandible and some postcranial material have also been found in association with the skull. Several important features of the occipital region of the skull support a referral to the family Gavialidae, which also includes the extant gharial and false gharial.  Paleobiology  The strata from which remains of Piscogavialis have been found suggest that it lived in a coastal environment. Another extinct gavialid, Siquisiquesuchus, is also known to have lived in a coastal setting. The presence of other gryposuchines in coastal strata may be an indication that all members of the subfamily inhabited coastal environments. However, some gryposuchines have been found from localities that clearly represent non-marine environments.

Ashirbad literally translates as blessing in the Nepali language. After the wedding, the bride moves into her husband‚Äôs family, usually far away from her family and friends. Since marriage is arranged by the elders of the family, the bride is surrounded by unfamiliar people, in new relationship, and with new duties. It is a sad moment for the bride and her family. The parents, relatives and friends of the bride pray that God will bless her with all the fortune and the happiness of the world in her new home. The album was produced in 1970, at the eve of wedding of the crown prince Dipendra of Nepal. The lyrics were written by Laxman Lohani and the music was written by Shiva Shankar.

Background and education George Massee was born in Scampston, East Yorkshire, the son of a farmer. He was educated at York School of Art and Downing College, Cambridge, but did not complete his degree.There is no reference to him in Venn's Alumni Cantabrigienses. South America and the Foreign Legion Massee had an early interest in natural history, publishing an article on British woodpeckers at the age of 16 and compiling a portfolio of botanical paintings. Through the influence of Richard Spruce, a family relative, he was able to travel on a botanical expedition to Panama and Ecuador, where, despite considerable hardships, he collected orchids and other plants. On his return, Massee joined the French Foreign Legion, hoping to see combat in the Franco-Prussian War, but, the war being almost over, he was prevailed upon to return home to the farm. He had nonetheless gained a \\"4th Chasseurs\\" tattoo on his arm as a result of his brief military adventure. Mycological career Back in Yorkshire, Massee developed a particular interest in fungi which he illustrated, his paintings attracting the attention of M.C. Cooke, the first head of mycology at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Having moved to London, he began a series of ambitious publications on fungi, whilst undertaking public lectures, and also working briefly at the Natural History Museum. When Cooke retired from Kew in 1893, Massee replaced him as Principal Assistant in Cryptogams, a post he retained till he himself retired in 1915. From 1904, Massee's assistant at Kew was A.D. Cotton who worked principally on the algae. In 1910 Elsie Wakefield also assisted Massee with the fungi, taking over his position after 1915. George Massee helped found the British Mycological Society in 1896 and was elected its first President, serving in that capacity from 1896 to 1898. He was awarded the Victoria Medal of Honour in 1902. He was President of the Quekett Microscopical Club from 1899-1903. During his career, he published over 250 scientific and popular books, papers, and articles on fungi, myxomycetes, plant pathology, and natural history. He was editor of the cryptogamic journal Grevillea for its final two volumes. Massee also described a substantial number of new fungal species, but (despite working in an herbarium) did not always keep type specimens. As a result, all too many of his new species are now relegated to lists of nomina dubia (names of uncertain application). Most of the collections he did retain are now in the mycological herbarium at Kew. Part of Massee's personal herbarium was, however, sold to the New York Botanical Garden in 1907.http://sciweb.nybg.org/science2/hcol/mass/index.asp The fungal genus Masseea was named after him, as were several species, including Acremonium masseei, Ascobolus masseei, Entoloma masseei, and Ocellaria masseeana.http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/Names.asp Beatrix Potter, whose mycological interests he encouraged, called him \\"a very pleasant kind gentleman.\\" His colleague John Ramsbottom said of him that \\"though often brilliant he was often careless: if he had had any capacity whatever for taking pains he would have been a genius.\\"Ramsbottom, J.

It flows through arid terrain, including the Painted Desert. Name The Puerco River is sometimes called Rio Puerco of the West, to distinguish it from the Rio Puerco of the East that rises in the same vicinity but flows east to the Rio Grande. Although the word Puerco means pig, it also used to mean dirty or filthy in Spanish, this usage in the southwest United States is better translated as Dirty River or Muddy River due its high content of silt and mud. Geography The intermittent river is the main tributary of the Little Colorado River, which is a tributary of the Colorado River. It drains an area of about and is long. The river's average discharge is very low, less than in normal years, because its drainage basin is extremely dry. For most of the year, the Puerco River is a braided wash containing little or no water, although large flash floods can occur in downpours. Course McKinley County, New Mexico. The Puerco River headwaters are on the western slopes of the Continental Divide of the Americas, east of Hosta Butte, in McKinley County, New Mexico. It flows first north, and then west, through a wide desert valley bordered by high rocky buttes and cliffs. It passes under Interstate 40, and receives the South Fork Puerco River from the right-south near Gallup. For most of its remaining course, I-40 and the former Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (now the BNSF Railway) tracks follow the river's valley. The Puerco River crosses into Apache County, Arizona. It flows by Houck, Sanders, and Chambers, and then flows through the middle of Petrified Forest National Park, where Lithodendron Wash enters from the left-north.

Swallow has been a lawyer since 1990 and was a member of the Utah State House of Representatives from 1996 to 2002. In December 2009, John Swallow was appointed Chief Deputy Attorney General for Utah. While serving as Chief Deputy, some of his most prominent projects included the fights to overturn the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and to gain state control of Utah's federally controlled lands. In November 2012, Swallow easily won the election for Utah Attorney General by a 64 to 30 percent margin.\\"Utah Election Results Retrieved August 8, 2013 In November 2013, following federal and state investigations into alleged improprieties, Swallow resigned, after less than a year in office,' Retrieved Nov 22. 2013 while proclaiming his innocence and denying all wrongdoing.

Mark Shurtleff, Salt Lake Tribune (October 3, 2019). In September 2019, the Utah State Legislature, by nearly-unanimous votes, approved a $1.5 million settlement, reimbursing Swallow for his legal fees. Early life Swallow said that when he was nine, his father was killed \\"in a stupid accident\\"; the claim was later questioned, to which Swallow clarified, \\"It is something that happened to my family more than 30 years ago. As a family, we do believe (his biological father) was killed in an accident ‚Äî that's how we grew up.\\" The Deseret News added, \\"Swallow says he did not purposely mislead the newspaper or voters.\\" The family moved to live with his maternal grandparents in Juneau, Alaska, for three years. When his mother married Richard Swallow, he moved to Orem, Utah, where he adopted his step-father's last name. The family later moved to South Spring Valley, Nevada, in an area of what is now Great Basin National Park, where Swallow's teenage years were spent on an alfalfa farm. Swallow served a Spanish-speaking mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Los Angeles, California, where he \\"learned to speak Spanish with an L.A. accent\\". He earned an undergraduate degree in Psychology and then a J.D. degree from Brigham Young University J. Reuben Clark Law School, where he was a member of the Law Review. In 1985, Swallow married Suzanne Seader; after his graduation they moved to Sandy, a suburb of Salt Lake City. They have five children. Politics In 1996, after working as a lawyer for several years, Swallow successfully ran for the Utah House of Representatives for a district based in Sandy and continued serving as a State Representative for six consecutive years. While in the legislature, Swallow sponsored the then- largest tax cut in Utah's history and was named Taxpayer Advocate of the Year by the Utah Taxpayers Association for sponsoring and passing legislation to reduce taxes in Utah. Swallow gave up his state house seat in 2002 to run for against freshman Democrat Jim Matheson. The district had been located entirely within Salt Lake County, but redistricting after the 2000 census pushed it into a large swath of rural territory in southern Utah. The redrawn 2nd was significantly more Republican than its predecessor. Indeed, Swallow's colleagues in the state told national Republicans that they had drawn a district that no Democrat could possibly win, even a conservative one like Matheson. As a result, the national party spent very little money on Swallow's behalf. Ultimately, Swallow lost to Matheson by a margin of only 1,600 votes, largely because he could not overcome a 25,800-vote deficit in Salt Lake County. Swallow sought a rematch in 2004, losing this time by 12 points. In 2009, Swallow was appointed as the Chief Deputy Attorney General of Utah for civil cases. A major focus was the state lawsuit to overturn U.S. President Obama's healthcare law. Swallow also sued Barack Obama and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to unlock federal land within Utah for oil and gas exploration, and to help fund education for Utah children. Swallow announced his candidacy for Attorney General in January 2012. During his race, he was endorsed by his predecessor, Attorney General Mark Shurtleff and U.S. Senator Mike Lee. Swallow was also endorsed in his candidacy by the NRA and received an \\"A+\\" rating from the 2nd Amendment organization, because of \\"his dedication to gun owners,\\" and \\"his defense of the second amendment.\\"http://www.nrapvf.org/news- alerts/2012/04/nra-pvf-endorses-john-swallow-for-utah-attorney-general.aspx Swallow was elected and sworn on January 7, 2013.

According to Johnson, who was indicted for mail-fraud charges related to his internet business iWorks, Swallow attempted to broker a deal to bribe Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid with $600,000 through lobbyist Richard Rawle. In May 2013, Marc Sessions Jenson (who was convicted in 2008 of defrauding millions from investors) turned receipts over to the FBI he claims show that in 2009 he gave Swallow free meals, massages, golf outings and rooms at a gated Newport Beach villa.

Public lands John Swallow has a track record of fighting for Utah's lands. He advocates a position arguing that federal control over land in Utah keeps the state government from having access to Utah's resources, and that this subsequently prevents economic growth and impinges on what he sees as constitutional rights. Swallow credits his upbringing on a farm with giving him an appreciation for the land and its worth. While serving as Chief Deputy Attorney General, Swallow doubled the size of the Public Lands litigation team. The office also filed suit over the Wild Lands Policy, filed notices of intent to litigate against the government over more than 12,000 RS-2477 roads, and worked to keep the Sage Grouse from being listed as an endangered species.

He is the chairman and founder of Hong Kong Television Network, and the founder of Hong Kong Broadband Network. He is also a member of the Board of Trustees, United College, the Chinese University of Hong Kong. As an entrepreneur in the telecommunications and technology industries, Wong set up City Telecom (H.K.) Limited (CTI) in 1992, providing alternative international direct dialing (IDD) services at affordable tariffs which broke the predominant market monopoly. In 1999, he established Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, building a territory-wide fibre network to provide super high speed broadband, telephone and IP-TV services, and led the company to become the second largest IP provider in Hong Kong. In 2010, Wong was voted the 60th most powerful person in Global Telecoms Business by the Global Telecom Business Magazine. In 2009, Wong's CTI applied for a domestic free television program service licence and in 2012, he disposed all telecom businesses to focus on the development of his television and multimedia businesses, eventually renaming CTI to Hong Kong Television Network (HKTV). However, HKTV's application was subsequently rejected in October 2013, prompting Wong to lead HKTV towards the mobile TV and internet shopping industries. A former member of the Liberal Party in the 1990s, Wong surrendered his Canadian citizenship and contested the 2016 legislative election in the Hong Kong Island constituency, with the objective to oust Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, but failed to win a seat. Education Wong holds a bachelor degree in electronics engineering and an Executive Master of Business Administration from the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Ricky Wong, Chairman and Co-founder, City TelecomRicky Wong builds Hong Kong‚Äôs 21st century network Career=Early years Ricky's entrepreneurship started as early as 17, when he claimed to have started the first private tutoring school for students in Hong Kong, and earned HK$40,000 (US$5128 in the 60s). Also reported in many other interviews by local press through the years, was that Ricky Wong had the business idea of bringing in non-taxed engineering textbooks from Taiwan when he was 21, at his 3rd year at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, which earned him a good fortune and helped fellow undergraduates, at a time when textbooks are rare and expensive locally. IDD Ricky Wong was instrumental to the introduction of callback IDD service to Hong Kong. In the early 90s, IDD was a luxurious service in Hong Kong, costing HK$12 (USD1.5) per minute and was monopolised by Hong Kong Telecom. At the time Ricky Wong migrated to Canada, where the Canadian Government liberalised the telecom market using callback, Ricky Wong and his cousin then wrote to the Hong Kong Government about it, and with the government's confirmation, the cousins brought callback to Hong Kong. With this new competition, IDD price started to drop over 50%. In March 1998, after lengthy negotiation with the government, Hong Kong Telecom International surrendered its exclusive licence for provision of certain external telecommunication circuits and services, eight years earlier than the scheduled expiry, in return for a cash compensation of HK$6.7 billion. According to official data, cumulative savings resulting from competition in the mobile and IDD service markets have also been substantial, while savings from IDD service were estimated at HK$25.5 billion between 1999 and 2002. Broadband Ricky Wong was also credited for bringing broadband internet to Hong Kong. At the time when the whole city is still wired by traditional copper wires using legacy technology (ADSL), with service speed limited to 1.5Mbit/s to 6Mbit/s, Ricky Wong acquired a fixed line service license and began a ten-year project of building an all new network in Hong Kong using fibre optics, of which accumulatively invested over HK$3 billion (US$400 million). The audacious investment decision was considered impossible by the market and investors, and Ricky Wong's company had lost money for seven years. As the investment project went on, with equipment and technical support from Cisco Systems, Ricky Wong successfully built the largest Metro Ethernet in the world, and launched probably the first 100Mbit/s & 1000Mbit/s broadband service for residential use in 2004 & 2005\\\\. His company became the second largest service provider in Hong Kong in 2008, the fastest growing service provider in 2009, and targets to overtake the incumbent in 2016. In 2010 he was awarded the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year China in the 'Telecom' category.

Ricky Wong is the chairperson of HKTV and remains in charge of the full operation of HKTV. He initiated the application for broadcast license in 2009, but the application was rejected in October 2013. As a result, operations of HKTV was adversely affected and the company dismissed 320 employers. Wong and the public blamed the government for using a vague and generic phrase \\"a basket of factors\\" to refuse its application. He then sought another way for the company to survive. In December 2013, HKTV acquired a mobile TV licence and the spectrum needed to broadcast, and planned to launch services on 1 July 2014. However, in March 2014, the government refused to accept HKTV's technical proposal on the deployment of DTMB, the mobile TV standard deployed in China. Such matter was brought to court for further judgment. Despite all these, Wong's actions made him to be named Radio Hong Kong's Icon of the Year in 2013. In February 2015, Wong led HKTV to seek business opportunities in internet shopping and launched online shopping platform \\"HKTV Mall\\". Wong aimed to build the largest and the most diversified in terms of brand names, products and services e-shopping mall in Hong Kong, providing one-stop shop & 24 X 7 services. HKTV Mall lost HK$200 million a year in the first two years of its operation. In October 2016, Wong launched a physical store of HKTV Mall in North Point to boost its online shopping business, targeted to its 1.23 million registered subscribers. Personal life  Ricky Wong has a daughter and a son with his first wife Helen, with whom he divorced in 2016. Wong is engaged to Shirley Yuen, former CEO of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. Wong is also a columnist with articles published in the local free newspapers The Headline and major financial newspaper Hong Kong Economic Times and its free newspaper arm The SkyPost.  Political Stance and participation  Wong is usually considered as a centrist, but he was supported by the Liberal Party when running in 2016 Hong Kong legislative election.  2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests  In the initial stages of dispute, Wong suggested a limited relation between the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill and his businesses and refused to comment. However, when the dispute were heating up, Wong has asked for government self-control for a few times. In 19 July, 35 leaders in business and political sectors, including Wong, urged for actual actions by the government to respond to the voice of the society, such as independent investigation of police violence, in the hope of mediating the worsening situation of Hong Kong. In 9 August, Wong openly criticized for the non-action and lying of police regarding the attacks in North Point and 2019 Yuen Long attack. On 12 November (2019 Chinese University of Hong Kong conflict), Wong urged the CUHK students and alumnus to go to CUHK and to protect the campus.

Located to the southeast of Paris in Chennevi√®res-sur-Marne, the fort was part of an outer ring of fortifications built in response to improvements in the range and effectiveness of artillery since the construction of the Thiers fortifications of the 1840s. It was built in accordance with improved principles of fortification developed for the S√©r√© de Rivi√®res system. The Fort de Champigny was built between 1878 and 1880 on an area of eight hectares at a location that had been used by the Prussians to bombard Paris in the 1870 war. The site controlled movement on the Paris-Troyes railway line at Champigny-sur-Marne. The four-sided fort is surrounded by a ditch and a counterscarp. The fort encloses a paved court surrounded by quarters for 388 men. Water was supplied by cisterns. The fort was initially armed with 34 guns. The fort was modernized in 1911, with additional fortifications in concrete, including two observation turrets in the fort's caponiers with machine guns. In 1914 the fort contained no more than ten guns on the rampart and ten on the caponiers. During the First World War the fort fired on the Plateau d'Avron with ten guns of 12 and 15 cm caliber. In 1939 and 1940 the fort was used for anti-aircraft artillery. The fort's caserne was burned in July 1944. The Fort de Champigny was taken out of military service in 1965. It was placed on the Supplemental Inventory of the Monuments Historiques in 1979. It has been under restoration since 1984, and is to serve as a youth center.

Movements in Modern Art: Arte Povera. London (2004): 34. Print. In December 1967, she had another show at the Piper Pluri Cub, a Turin isco that had opened the year before to host radical artistic events. In October 1968, she participated in the three day Arte Povera + Azione Povera event, curated by Germano Celant, in Amalfi.\\"Arte Povera piu azioni povere 1968\\", Madre. Retrieved 18 October 2018. This Arte povera event, which also included the artists Michelangelo Pistoletto, Alighiero Boetti, Giovanni Anselmo, and Mario Merz, was radical for its avant-garde display of every day \\"poor\\" materials as art. Her work continued to reflect many of the fundamental issues with which Arte Povera artists are preoccupied, such as organic forms, subjectivity, the use of lower forms of art, including crafts, and the relationship between art and life. In 1969 she had a solo exhibition at the Attico Gallery in Rome. Her works took on an openly environmental character in a series of \\"rooms.\\" Her husband Mario was supportive of her art and her career and would help her with her installations.Lumley, Robert. Movements in Modern Art: Arte Povera. London (2004): 37. Print. In 1975 she also had a solo exhibition in Rome. This exhibition featured installations made by using knitted copper, under the title of Ad occhi chiusi gli occhi sono straordinariamente aperti ('To closed eyes, the eyes are extraordinarily open'). As a young artist, Merz did not receive wide-spread recognition, despite her huge contribution to the scene. Later, the growth of feminism brought her greater consideration. Marisa Merz's art has been described as lyrical, subtle, visionary, and private. Her installations feature the idea of the home as an intimate place, private, and feminine. An example is her 1966 installation Untitled (Living Sculpture), which was intended both for her home and to be presented in a gallery (she once said 'There has never been any division between my life and my work'). The installation consisted of thin strips of aluminium, clipped and suspended from the ceiling, forming coils and spirals. The work was acquired by Tate Modern in 2009. Her practice integrated aspects of craft and practices traditionally associated with women (e.g. knitting) and often employed mundane materials, such as copper, aluminum, waxed paper, and paraffin wax, which reflected her home environment. In this way, her art exemplifies that of the Arte Povera group, which collectively sought to \\"call into question‚Äîif not subvert‚Äîthe high-gloss finish of fine art and its deadness as an institutional commodity.\\" As an artist, Merz refused to formally name or date her works and claimed that art making operated \\"beyond time.\\" In her 1975 artist statement she talked about the absent divide between her life and her work that she created. By this time she had extracted herself from the art scene and practically locked herself in her studio to work. Therein she reflected about life with her daughter, Bea, while she was constructing her aluminum sculptures and how her daughter taught her so much in that time. In 1977, Merz had a solo exhibition at Galleria Salvatore Ala in Milan, Italy. After her husband's death in 2003, Merz left his studio untouched and continued to work into her 90s. In 2015, Beatrice Merz later opened a contemporary art center, the Fondazione Merz, in Turin. She took part in documenta 7 in 1982 and documenta 9 in Kassel in 1992. She was also included in the Venice Binnale in 1988. In 1994, she had her first US show at Barbara Gladstone.

He made his film debut in 2012 with the romantic comedy Vicky Donor, in which his performance as a sperm donor earned him the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. Following a brief setback, he starred in the commercially and critically successful romance Dum Laga Ke Haisha (2015).

In addition to acting, Khurrana has sung for several of his films, including the song \\"Pani Da Rang\\", which earned him the Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer. Early life and education Khurrana was born on 14 September 1984 in Chandigarh to Poonam and P. Khurrana, as Nishant Khurrana. His parents changed his name to Ayushmann Khurrana when he was 3 years old. He was a part of Guru Nanak Khalsa College. He studied at St. John's High School, Chandigarh and DAV College, Chandigarh.

He hosted the show Big Chai ‚Äì Maan Na Maan, Main Tera Ayushmann and also won the Young Achievers Award in 2007 for it. He was the youngest recipient of the Bharat Nirman Award in New Delhi.

Apart from hosting the second season of MTV Rock On and India's Got Talent on Colors, Khurrana was also a part of the anchoring team of Extra Innings T20 for Indian Premier League Season 3 on SET Max with Gaurav Kapur, Samir Kochhar , and Angad Bedi. Following which he took up the offer of anchoring the dance-based reality show Just Dance on STAR Plus. 2012‚Äì2015: Film debut and career struggles Khurrana at an event for Vicky Donor (2012), his film debut Khurrana made his acting debut in 2012 with Shoojit Sircar's romantic comedy Vicky Donor, co-starring Annu Kapoor and Yami Gautam. It marked the production debut of actor John Abraham, and starred Khurrana in the titular role of a sperm donor. In preparation, he attended acting workshops and interacted with medical professionals. For the film's soundtrack, he sang \\"Pani Da Rang\\", which he had written and composed with Rochak Kohli back in 2003. Praising the film's ensemble cast, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com wrote that Khurrana's \\"candid disposition and roguish face ensures his street smart drollery works like a breeze\\". With worldwide earnings of over against a budget of , Vicky Donor emerged as a commercial success. At the Filmfare Awards ceremony, Khurrana was awarded trophies for Best Male Debut and Best Male Playback Singer. In 2013, Khurrana appeared in Forbes India Celebrity 100 list, ranking 70th with an estimated annual income of . He then collaborated with Kunaal Roy Kapur in Rohan Sippy's Nautanki Saala! (2013), a comedy based on the French film Apr√®s Vous (2005). Anupama Chopra found Khurrana to be \\"earnest\\" in it but felt that his comedic work was overshadowed by that of Roy Kapur. He also recorded two songs for the film's soundtrack. A year later, Khurrana teamed with Yash Raj Films (as part of a three-film deal) in the romantic comedy Bewakoofiyaan (2014), co-starring Sonam Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor, about a young man who has trouble convincing his girlfriend's father to approve of their marriage. Writing for The New York Times, Andy Webster disliked the film's \\"strained, contrived humor\\" but commended Khurrana for \\"holding his own opposite [Rishi] Kapoor\\". Both Nautanki Saala and Bewakoofiyaan were commercially unsuccessful, as was his next release, Hawaizaada (2015). In it, he played the scientist Shivkar Bapuji Talpade, for which he lost weight and learnt to speak Marathi. In the same year, Khurrana collaborated with his wife, Tahira Kashyap, to write his autobiography Cracking the Code: My Journey to Bollywood. Khurrana's career prospects improved when he starred opposite newcomer Bhumi Pednekar in the Sharat Katariya directed-romance Dum Laga Ke Haisha (2015). It tells the story of an underachieving man who is married against his will to an overweight woman. Anuj Kumar of The Hindu praised him for effectively capturing his character's \\"diction and body language\\". Despite minimal promotions, the film emerged as a commercial success, grossing over worldwide against its budget. 2017‚Äìpresent: Success Two years later, after starring in the poorly received Meri Pyaari Bindu, Khurrana's career progressed with his two other films releases of 2017, Bareilly Ki Barfi and Shubh Mangal Saavdhan, both of which were commercially successful. In the former, adapted from Nicolas Barreau's French novel The Ingredients of Love, he played alongside Rajkummar Rao and Kriti Sanon as a writer involved in a love triangle. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV wrote that Khurrana does a \\"convincing job of mutating from a brooding jilted lover to a crooked manipulator who puts his own interests above everyone else's\\". In Shubh Mangal Saavdhan, he starred opposite Bhumi Pednekar as a newly engaged man suffering from erectile dysfunction. A remake of the Tamil film Kalyana Samayal Saadham (2013), Khurrana hoped that the film's humorous take on mental and sexual problems faced by men would bring wider attention to the topic. Rajeev Masand took note of how well the film handled sexuality without being crude and commended him for \\"investing the fellow with genuine likeability and an understated charm\\". Khurrana received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for the latter film. Khurrana accepting the 2019 National Film Award for Best Actor for his performance in Andhadhun In 2018, Khurrana starred in two of the top-grossing Hindi films of the year. His first role was in Sriram Raghavan's Andhadhun, a thriller co-starring Tabu and Radhika Apte, in which he played a blind pianist who unwillingly becomes embroiled in a murder. He lobbied for the part after hearing about it from the casting director Mukesh Chhabra, and in preparation, he learnt how to play the piano and interacted with blind piano players. Udita Jhunjhunwala of Mint praised Khurrana for giving a \\"taut performance that balances vulnerability with craftiness\\" and Ankur Pathak of HuffPost found his to be \\"a layered, no- holds-barred performance worth applauding\\". Andhadhun earned worldwide, a majority of which came from the Chinese box office, to become Khurrana's highest-grossing release and one of Indian cinema's biggest grossers. He next starred in Badhaai Ho, a comedy from director Amit Sharma about a young man whose middle-aged parents get pregnant. Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost considered his performance to be \\"completely convincing\\" and commended him for choosing \\"to work in small films where the star is the story\\". A sleeper hit, it earned over worldwide. For Andhadhun, Khurrana won the National Film Award for Best Actor (shared with Vicky Kaushal for Uri: The Surgical Strike) and the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor. The series of successful films continued with Khurrana's 2019 releases, Article 15, Dream Girl, and Bala. In the formermost, a crime thriller directed by Anubhav Sinha, he played the starring role of a righteous police officer solving a rape case. Highlighting caste discrimination in India, the film was inspired by multiple events, including the 2014 Badaun gang rape allegations and the 2016 Una flogging incident. Khurrana agreed to the project to play a dark and intense character for the first time in his film career. Writing for The Guardian, Wendy Ide commended him for \\"combin[ing] soulful Bollywood heartthrob charisma with an arrestingly intense performance.\\" In the comedy Dream Girl, he starred as a cross-gender actor who speaks in a female voice while working at a call centre which unwittingly attracts male attention. Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in considered his \\"manic energy and believable Everyman persona\\" to be the film's highlight. His next release, Bala, was also a comedy, in which he played a young man who faces societal pressure due to premature balding. He found it physically challenging to play the part due to the heavy layers of prosthetics used on his head. Rajeev Masand opined that Khurrana \\"cuts a sympathetic figure as another not-instantly-likeable loser\\" and added that he had \\"cornered the market when it comes to playing flawed, insecure men with confidence issues\\". He won another Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor for Article 15 and received a Best Actor nomination at the ceremony for Bala. That year, he reappeared on Forbes India Celebrity 100 list, ranking 37th with an estimated annual income of . For his next project, Khurrana actively looked for another mainstream film that would portray sexuality in a humorous manner. He found it in Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan (2020), in which he played a gay man who has trouble convincing his partner's family of their relationship. Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express credited Khurrana for \\"allowing the film to be so much about\\" his lesser known co-star Jitendra Kumar. It underperformed commercially. Khurrana was next seen in the comedy-drama Gulabo Sitabo, co-starring Amitabh Bachchan. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film was unable to be released theatrically and instead streamed on Prime Video. Personal life Khurrana was born in Chandigarh. His father P Khurrana is an astrologer and an author on the subject of astrology, whereas his mother Poonam is a housewife and she is of half-Burmese descent and a qualified M.A. in Hindi. While Ayushmann remains busy with his work in Mumbai, his family still stays in Chandigarh. His brother Aparshakti Khurana is a radio jockey at Radio Mirchi 98.3 FM in Delhi and made his debut in the 2016 Aamir Khan- starrer film Dangal. The ambiance of literature at home influenced Khurrana as well and he took writing as a hobby. He also maintains a blog where he writes in Hindi and it has been received very well by his admirers. Ayushmann is known for being very close to his family and wife, Tahira Kashyap who has directed a critically acclaimed film Toffee. They are childhood sweethearts and are parents of a son and a daughter. His son, Virajveer, was born on 2 January 2012 and his daughter, Varushka, was born on 21 April 2014. In 2018, when he was promoting Badhaai Ho and Andhadhun, his wife Tahira was diagnosed with stage 0 breast cancer. Tahira's positive outlook helped them remain rock solid through this difficult phase.

George Thomas was a stagecoach driver who came west to California in 1849, before moving to Walla Walla. Colonel J. S. Ruckle arrived in Oregon in 1855 as a steam boat pilot for the Oregon Steam Navigation Company (OSN) along the Columbia River. Eventually Ruckle left the OSN and ran his own boat along the river. The two men planned and built the road in 1864 and 1865, as well as a stage line from Walla Walla to the Idaho Mines. The road ran from the northwest to the southeast, offering a more direct connection to Walla Walla, despite being longer than the Meacham Road. The Ruckle Road, as well as others over the Blues, charged $3 to $5 per wagon. Several towns were platted along the road: Summerville in 1873, and Cove sometime in the 1870s. Mail was delivered over the road, causing it to bypass La Grande in favor of Union and Summerville, helping Union become elected as the county seat in 1872.

The common name of the species is club coral. It is a member of the basidiomycete fungi family Gomphaceae. Description The species has a fruiting body in the shape of a club. The flesh is white, thin, and hollow at the top. The vertical side of the fruiting body normally has folds and wrinkles, but can be smooth. The spores are smooth and their spore print is pale yellow to ochre. The yellow chanterelle is distantly related to the mushroom and looks nearly the same, except for the ridges and cross-veined hymenium. The authors of Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America said that they think that it is unlikely that anyone would confuse the mushroom with another species. Habitat The mushroom's habitat is in coniferous forests from summer to autumn. The mushroom is a common species. The species is found at a high elevation and is widely distributed. C. truncatus can bioaccumulate significant amounts of zinc, and radioactive caesium-137. Edibility The mushroom is edible and has a sweet taste. While the species is edible, old mushrooms may be spongy and soft inside. The species is high in nutrition and can be used for cooking. The authors of North American mushrooms: a field guide to edible and inedible fungi said that the mushroom has a pleasant odor. A Field Guide to Mushrooms: North America says that the mushroom is one of the best to eat and has a sweet flavor that is especially appealing to some people. David Arora, the author of Mushrooms demystified: a comprehensive guide to the fleshy fungi, said that the mushroom can be sauteed and served for dessert. Medicinal The mushroom contains clavaric acid, which has been shown to reduce the rate of tumor development when given to mice. Clavaric acid interferes with farnesyltransferase, an enzyme implicated in tumorigenesis, which suggests that clavaric acid may have therapeutic value in the treatment of certain cancers.

The British Channel 4 science fiction comedy-drama Misfits features a number of fictional characters. The main cast comprises five characters, while a number of additional characters support the show. The main cast originally consisted of Alisha Daniels (Antonia Thomas), Curtis Donovan (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett), Kelly Bailey (Lauren Socha), Nathan Young (Robert Sheehan), and Simon Bellamy (Iwan Rheon). After Sheenan (Nathan) left the role Rudy Wade (Joseph Gilgun) was introduced. Rheon (Simon) and Thomas (Alisha) departed their roles at the end of series 3. Seth (Matthew McNulty) is initially introduced as a guest character but later begins appearing in a recurring role. Jess (Karla Crome) and Finn (Nathan McMullen) join the cast in a main role at the beginning of series four. Supporting characters introduced have included Sally (Alex Reid), Pete (Michael Obiora), Superhoodie, Nikki (Ruth Negga), Shaun (Craig Parkinson) and Greg (Shaun Dooley). Main cast The initial five main characters are brought together when they are all sent to community service for various crimes. A storm occurs and the group are struck by it without any damage. They discover they each have a superpower, with the exception of Nathan, who does not find out his power until the finale of the first series. Their probation worker Tony is also affected by the storm and flies into a murderous rage. They kill Tony in self-defence. After this, the group go on to become more of a unit when further developments of how many other people who were affected by the storm comes to light. Rudy, Jess and Finn eventually join the group when they end up in community service, integrating with the group as the original members leave. Nathan Young Alongside the rest of the 'ASBO five', Nathan gains his powers in the storm. Nathan's powers aren't revealed till later in the series, whereupon in S1E6 Nathan falls off the roof of the community center and is impaled on the fence below him. Nathan wakes up later in his coffin, realizing he is immortal. Nathan dies a total of five times in the series. In S2E2 Nathan is revealed to have a 'second' power, as he is able to see the ghosts of the recently deceased. Nathan later goes on to sell his power and buy a new one in S2E7, exchanging his immortality for the ability to use 'real' magic. His new power is only visible in the short 'Vegas Baby!'.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8TJEpIj_4& Simon Bellamy Simon began the series with the power of invisibility, tying into Simon's reclusiveness and how he feels 'invisible' when alienated by the rest of the group. While Initially he struggles with controlling his power, he gains access to it fairly quickly. in S2E7, Simon sells his power, and purchases another. Simon gains the ability of Foresight to begin with, making him able see the imminent future of a course of events. He can alter his future by choosing a different course of events if he chooses to. When Simon realizes he has to become 'Superhoodie', he purchases two other powers. Immunity, and One- way time travel. Immunity is the ability to be unaffected by other people's powers, whilst One way time travel is the power to travel back in time to any desired point, however, unlike Time Reversal, the user cannot return to the present and instead of appearing in their past-self, they appear as a duplicate whilst their past-self stays where they were at that time. Kelly Bailey Kelly originally had the power of telepathy. After she sold this power she then gained a power that made her a rocket scientist. She briefly gained the power to turn back time in an alternate time stream (created when the previous owner of the turn back time power tried to kill Hitler and inadvertently gave Hitler his cell phone - enabling the Nazis to win WW2) but switched back to being a rocket scientist after correcting the time stream. Curtis Donovan Curtis originally had the power of time manipulation, allowing him to travel back and change events, stemming from his regret over the incident that led to his community service. He later exchanged this for the power to swap biological sex, and later the ability to resurrect the dead (albeit as zombies). Alisha Daniels Alisha initially gained the ability to make those who touch her skin go into a sexual frenzy towards her. She later gains the power to see through another person's eyes. She knew Rudy in high school, and has a relationship with Curtis. She later fell in love with future Simon, carrying those feelings over to the present Simon when his future self died. Her death prompted Simon's return to the past. Rudy Wade Portrayed by Joe Gilgun, Rudy is given community service after damaging his ex-girlfriend's car. The storm affected him so that he splits off a gentler and sadder version of himself, Rudy Two. It's later revealed that there was a third, more aggressive Rudy as well, who the other two let get arrested and go to prison. A shallow womaniser for most of the show, he changes his ways after meeting and falling in love with the nun Nadine. He ends up in a relationship with Jess. Jess Jess is played by Karla Crome. She and Finn join community service at the same time. She gained the ability to see through solid objects. She has a brief relationship with Alex, but eventually ends up with Rudy. Finn Samson Finn is played by Nathan McMullen. His power is telekinesis, though he can usually only move small objects with great effort. For most of his time on community service he has a deep crush on Jess. Abbey Smith Portrayed by Natasha O'Keeffe, Abbey Smith believes she lost her memory in the storm, since she can't remember her life before it. Rudy and Finn encounter her drunk and unconscious at a party; she later pretends to be on community service to keep Finn out of trouble, but is found out and sentenced to community service for real. Alex Alex is played by Matt Stokoe. A barman who works with Curtis, he first appears in the fourth series and behaves oddly around women, including Jess when she asks him out. It's revealed he has no powers as he wasn't caught in the storm, but has been affected by someone else's power. And the end of series four he is injured and receives a lung transplant from a storm survivor, gaining the power to remove the powers of others by having sex with them. At the start of series five, he breaks into the community centre to save Jess from a possessed Finn, and is sentenced to community service as punishment. Supporting cast=Sally Sally, played by Alex Reid, appears in the first episode. Sally is revealed to be the fianc√©e of Tony, whom the group have killed in self- defence. She becomes the group's new probation worker. She suspects that the Misfits are involved in Tony's disappearance and she begins leaving threatening messages in group's lockers. She begins contacting Simon over the internet under the alias 'Shygirl18'. In the 4th episode of series 1 , she searches their lockers, finding Tony's credit card in Simon's. In the next episode, she fakes an interest in Simon in order to find evidence that the Misfits are involved in Tony's death, but Simon rejects her suggestion that he should turn the other Misfits in, proclaiming they are the only friends he has. Simon accidentally kills her when he throws her against a door as they violently fight each other. Simon keeps her corpse in a freezer in the community centre and visits her body often. In the first episode of the second series, Simon realises that he needs to dispose of Sally's body, since a search is to be conducted. While sneaking her out, under a sheet in a wheelbarrow, he is confronted by the other Misfits, and tells them what happened. At the end of the episode, the Misfits wrap her in blankets, row out to the middle of the canal, and dump her weighted body into the water. Sally re-appears in the finale of Series 3, when she is brought back by a medium. Thinking she has been brought back to take revenge upon the gang she tricks Simon into kissing her, filming it on his phone and sends it to Alisha. She later tries to push Alisha off a building but is stopped when Tony finds her. He tells her they have both been brought back to say goodbye to one another, they then embrace and kiss, moving on to the afterlife. Pete Pete, played by Michael Obiora, first appears in episode 3 of series 1. He first appears when investigating the disappearance of Gary and Tony. He later tells Sally that Tony has purchased a ticket for a flight using his credit card so it is likely Tony is alive. In episode 4, it is revealed that he was the policeman who arrested Curtis for drugs possession, resulting in his community service sentence. When Curtis goes back in time, we see Pete in the club. He asks Alisha where she bought drugs from and rejects her advances. After Alisha points out a drug dealer who is speaking to Curtis and Sam he searches them. Upon finding Curtis with a small amount of drugs he gives Curtis community service to send out a message because of his status. In episode 6 of series 1 he comes looking for Sally at the community centre. He later appears in episode 1 of series 2 when questioning the group about Sally's whereabouts after her disappearance and tells Shaun that he may disappear next. Superhoodie Superhoodie, played by Daniel Ilabaca, first appears in one of Simon's videos, helping a member of the public, and features on posters both on the E4 website game and in the show. In the first series' finale, Superhoodie helps Nathan escape a group of 'Virtue' followers. His face is concealed by a hood and a black mask. He is later seen in another of Simon's videos, demonstrating extreme free running skills before talking to Simon. He reveals he has been watching the Misfits and is aware of their abilities. In the first series, Superhoodie is portrayed by free runner Neil Hutson. Superhoodie returns in the first episode of the second series, dressed in black, initially studying a room full of photos of the Misfits along with five large digital clocks counting down to an unspecified target. He throws a paper aeroplane from a building across a river to Kelly, informing her to go to Nathan's grave where she discovers his immortality. He returns at the conclusion of the episode, saving Curtis from suffocation at the hands of Lucy. In the second episode of the second series, he shields a temporarily mortal Nathan from his brother Jamie's exploding car, causing him to be apparently hurt quite badly by shrapnel, though he manages to escape. In episode 3 of Series 2 Superhoodie leads the group to Nikki's flat. Having repeatedly saved Alisha from danger, Superhoodie reveals himself to be a future version of Simon to her, and makes her keep his identity hidden. It is revealed that he is immune to Alisha's power, while present-day Simon is not. They enter into a secret relationship and he tells her that he travelled through time to make sure particular events happen. In the fourth episode of the second series, Ollie is put into community service along with the group but is soon after killed by Tim, and his heart is transplanted to Nikki, who in turn gains Ollie's power. Alisha confronts future Simon when she discovers that he knew it would happen but didn't stop it, but Simon tells her that if he saved Ollie, there would have been consequences. When Tim kidnaps Kelly, the group steal ¬£100,000, but when they deliver it to him, Tim takes the other Misfits hostage. Alisha escapes her binds but Tim catches her. He is about to shoot her but future Simon, who has been timing the events, drops down from a skylight and takes the bullet. As Tim leaves to complete his next 'level', Alisha cradles a dying Simon and admits she is in love with him. He dies and at his instruction Alisha burns his body, having received the key to his base. Alisha reveals Superhoodie's true identity to Simon after the Misfits go public, as well as her relationship with him, but this timeline is erased by Curtis. In the three-month gap between the second series' finale and the Christmas special, Alisha tells Simon who Superhoodie really is. The Independent described the character as a \\"guardian angel for the misfits\\" who is \\"seen free-running, leaping from rooftop to rooftop until he stands, Batman-like, surveying the city\\". Shaun Shaun, played by Craig Parkinson, is a probation worker who replaces Sally's position in the second series. He has a very relaxed, somewhat bored attitude towards the group, and although he seems to understand when they are lying to him, he doesn't let it bother him if it happens beyond his working hours, at which point he washes his hands of all responsibility and goes home. He is also not worried by the fact that the last two probation workers have disappeared. The Misfits unintentionally kill him on his first day of work when they assume that he is the disguised Lucy, but Curtis is able to undo the event. In the second series' penultimate episode he overhears Nathan, Curtis and Simon talking about their powers and sells them out to the media before leaving the country. Curtis later rewinds this timeline. He becomes the group's probation worker when they begin community service for a second time. In the fifth episode of the third series he is stabbed by a girl called Jen who swaps bodies with Kelly. As he is dying from the wound in the changing rooms of the community centre, the group revealed to him that they have superpowers. He laughs in his last few moments expressing his disbelief that he has remained ignorant to the situation. In an alternative timeline where the Nazis won WWII, Shaun was a Nazi officer. He had a relationship with Alisha after she was caught drunk driving and he released her. He was shot by Kelly, who wanted to release Seth from prison and was disappointed to find out that Alisha was cheating on him with Simon. Neela Debnath of The Independent labelled Shaun \\"lecherous\\". MSN News opined that Shaun was played \\"brilliantly\\" and questioned if the fact that he makes it clear that he \\"couldn't care less about the young offenders\\" has anything to do with him having \\"survived longer than any of his predecessors\\". Neela Debnath of The Independent felt Shaun's ending was \\"shocking\\" adding that even though all previous probation workers had been killed it was \\"completely unexpected\\" when Shaun was killed. Debnath added that out of all previous probation workers he was \\"the most memorable because of his apathetic attitude towards youth offenders and the rehabilitation system\\". She added that Parkinson's performance has been \\"brilliant\\" through his time on the show which means both he and his character will \\"be sorely missed\\". On his final moments she added that they were \\"very touching\\" because there was an understanding between the group and Shaun. Digital Spy branded Shaun \\"fab\\". Nikki Nikki, played by Ruth Negga, is a young woman with an unspecified heart condition who becomes involved with the gang. She is introduced in the second episode of the second series when Curtis' inverted power causes him to 'flash forward' and experience a future event, a romantic encounter on a rooftop with Nikki. The Misfits then encounter her in the present when they break into her flat, mistakenly believing it was the residence of Superhoodie, who had led the group there. Curtis continues to visit her, learning about her heart condition. When Ollie, the group's new member of community service, is shot and killed, Nikki is given his heart. The transplant cures her heart condition, but also leaves her with Ollie's ability to teleport. Nikki possesses little to no control over this ability. When Nikki feels she is about to teleport, she experiences a sensation similar to falling, or being drawn backwards, and then she immediately shifts to her new location. Nikki and Curtis begin a relationship after he tells her about the Misfits' powers and the effects of the storm. During a fancy dress party, the two of them experience the events from Curtis' 'flash-forward' again. In the Christmas special, Curtis and Nikki sell their abilities to Seth, who can deal powers. The couple plan to travel together, but Nikki is shot and killed by an armed robber under the orders of a priest named Elliot pretending to be Jesus. Her death inspires the group to try and regain their abilities, as Nikki would never have died if they still had their powers. Curtis' power to rewind time is no longer available, since he sold his power to Seth, and Nikki remains dead. SethGreg Greg, played by Shaun Dooley, is the gang's fifth probation worker, replacing Laura, who was bitten by a zombie and subsequently killed by Rudy before she could start her first day. He first appears at the end of the first episode of Series 4. He mocks Finn in front of the group. Later on Finn asks Greg if he can leave the community centre, to which Greg responds by asking him to pay him. When Finn pays him Greg takes his money and refuses to let him leave. Dooley had been a fan of the show since it began so approached the casting director for a role. The casting director later told the producer of the show who agreed that Dooley would be \\"ideal\\" as the new probation worker. Dooley described Greg, saying he is \\"really, really horrible ‚Äì a complete sociopath. He can flip on the turn of a coin from being really nice to completely horrific, and he‚Äôs suddenly someone who‚Äôs going to kill you there and then. He‚Äôs brilliant to play\\". He added that the character is \\"a test to play\\" due to his nature to \\"flip\\" when he is acting naturally, similar to \\"Jekyll and Hyde within his own personality\\". Dooley felt the part a challenge to play due to Greg's intensity. Dooley said Greg is \\"very funny, but because his character‚Äôs so funny\\", explaining that the audience are supposed to \\"laugh at him\\" rather than with him. Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffrey said the first episode of series 4 begins to feel like the show has \\"begun to find itself again\\", which is \\"compounded with the magnificent arrival of sinister new probation worker Greg\\". Neela Debnath of The Independent commented that Greg \\"is terrifying and may even have a scary power of his own. However, he comes across as far too aggressive and hostile without any reason it would seem. His frightening temperament will probably be explained later on but at the moment it feels too jarring and he is just a pure ball of fury\\". Radio Times said \\"Dooley growls, gnashes his teeth and generally has a whale of a time as the terrifying new probation officer\\". Lola Lola, played by Lucy Gaskell is introduced in episode 2 of series 4. Lola was originally an aspiring actress called Debby. As a result of the storm, her desire to better embody her characters transformed her into one of her roles: Lola, a manipulative seductress with a troubled past. As Lola, she seduced men into killing her ex-boyfriends, eventually setting her sights on Curtis while pretending to be a trainee probation worker. After manipulating him into killing her ex-boyfriend Jake, Curtis eventually learns the truth behind her power while Lola begins to set up Curtis's murder. Events transpire in which Lola shoots and kills her new boyfriend in an attempt to stage a double murder. This results in Curtis getting shot, but his current situation as a zombie leaves him invulnerable allowing him to bite and then murder Lola. This is then followed by his own suicide. Digital Spy's Catriona Wightman said Lola is \\"so clearly bad news that she should really wear a hat with a flashing warning sign. She's properly full on, purring about how she loves bad boys and spraying graffiti to watch Curtis \\"scrub\\". Unsurprisingly, this ends up with the duo doing the dirty at the end of the episode\\". Wightman felt it \\"hard to really care\\" about the storyline as she knew it was only building up the storyline for the next episode.

An interim facility, called the Mayo Mountain Access, was opened to the public on April 1, 2010. Information The park's principle public access area is the Mayo Mountain Access, near Mayodan. A visitor contact station, two picnic shelters, a small picnic area, a half-mile loop hiking trail, a 1.8-mile loop hiking trail, rest rooms, a catch and release fishing pond, and a maintenance facility were built or renovated at the public access.

It was created by her alongside Claude Dir and Olivier Gillotin of the company Givaudan. The product, which was released on February 3, 2010, uses the tagline \\"catch the fever\\". The release was promoted with a cover version of \\"Fever\\" recorded by Beyonc√© and a limited edition extended play (EP) also titled Heat. She also appeared at Macy's Herald Square to launch the perfume and on The Today Show where she discussed about Heat. The fragrance's commercial, directed by director Jake Nava and released in December 2009, spawned controversy for its sexually explicit imagery, and was only allowed nighttime broadcast in the United Kingdom. Macy's sold US$3 million worth of Heat between early February and early March 2010. It received mixed reviews from critics, and it was nominated at several fragrance award ceremonies. Heat was followed by five additional releases: Heat Ultimate Elixir meant to capture a more private side of the entertainer, Heat Rush intended as a daytime fragrance, Midnight Heat, a night fragrance, Heat The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour, a limited product dedicated to the tour of that name, Heat Wild Orchid, a floral update of the original, Heat Kissed, a romantic update of the original and Heat Seduction. Each scent was followed with its own Eau De Parfum release and multiple gift sets.

Conception=Development Knowles performing during the I Am... World Tour, 2009. She said that the main inspiration for the title of Heat came from the live performances of her tours which utilized pyrotechnics. In December 2009, Beyonc√© announced that she would release her first fragrance, titled Heat, the following year. Prior to releasing the fragrance, she had collaborated with Tommy Hilfiger on his perfume True Star in 2004 and Giorgio Armani's Diamonds for which she also appeared in several promotional campaigns. Beyonc√© created the fragrance in 2009 with the testing of its smell done by Coty, Inc.. Beyonc√© presented Heat to her fans during backstage meetings on her I Am... World Tour (2009‚Äì10). It was released in the United States on February 3, 2010. According to Beyonc√©'s official parfum website, Heat is a \\"captivating fragrance that unleashes a spirited fire within.\\" It was also described as \\"a unique expression of a woman's powerful sensuality: sexy, elegant yet feminine with an air of mystery\\", summing up that the fragrance reflects \\"a self-assured woman, who is not afraid to desire and to be desired.\\" Beyonc√©s' official perfume website also described Heat as an \\"alluring [and] modern fragrance... [which] embodies a compelling spirit\\". In a behind the scenes video, Beyonc√© revealed the reason behind naming the fragrance Heat. According to her, it was because the scent comes off as \\"infectious\\", further elaborating: \\"It's like something you can't get enough of. It's hot, it's sexy, it definitely makes you feel like you caught the fever.\\" She additionally stated that her favorite fragrance notes are red vanilla orchid, due to its \\"sexy\\" and \\"spicy\\" smell, and honeysuckle, due to its \\"sensual\\" and \\"sweet\\" smell. She concluded: \\"It was a lot of work but I was really really happy and I think it's something I'll be proud of 20 years from now.\\" During an interview with Teen Vogue, Beyonc√© stated that she loved the perfume because it featured notes of orchid, her favorite flower. She further said that it was suitable for her alter ego Sasha Fierce as it was \\"fiery\\". Packaging and scent Heat is packaged in a red triangular bottle. The top of the bottle is edged with a gold band and the words \\"Beyonc√©\\" and \\"Heat\\" and the cap is etched with the letter B. The scent has been described as floral, fruity and woody, and it was marketed as both \\"feminine and irresistible\\" by the entertainer's official perfume website. The fragrance is described as having top notes of vanilla, magnolia, neroli and peach; middle notes of almond macaroon, honeysuckle and musk; and base notes with \\"a warm and sexy dry-down\\" of giant sequoia milkwood, tonka bean and amber. Reviewers particularly identified tonka bean, neroli and almond, along with woody and floral notes. Following the release of Heat, Beyonc√© described its bottle design, scent and inspiration in depth, as follows: > A lot of my performances have had fire involved, so we thought 'Heat.' Also, > red is one of my favorite colors, as is gold. So then we thought of making > the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles ‚Äî my mother had a > collection of them when I was growing up. I wanted something with an antique > yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try to find things that > have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The > bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the > bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials‚Äìthat's me. When > I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [creative > control over a fragrance] until this project.

Thompson said in a behind the scenes look at the shoot for the fragrance, that he wanted to capture Beyonc√© \\"in her true essence\\", where she \\"generates heat\\" and is just \\"sensual and fun and full of energy.\\" A writer of Rap-Up praised her look, saying that she was \\"burning up\\" the print. The advertisement was published in fashion, beauty and lifestyle magazines in February 2010. On February 3, 2010, Beyonc√© launched the scent at Macy's Herald Square in New York City, where she posed for photos and signed autographs for fans. Heat was released in 2,000 department and specialty store doors in the United States. The collection was also released in Canada and Latin America in February 2010 with additional global distribution in Europe, Asia and Australia in August 2010. On February 9, 2010, Beyonc√© appeared on The Today Show where she talked about Heat. From January 15, 2011, to February 15, 2011, Seventeen magazine gave away 10,000 free samples of Heat. A sample of the fragrance was given for each copy of the February 2011 issue of the magazine bought. A sample of Heat was distributed alongside each copy of Beyonc√©'s live album, I Am... World Tour (2010) and her fourth studio album, 4 (2011). Industry sources estimated that Coty Beauty spent a total of $20 million on advertising and promotion of the perfume the first year after its release. Commercial The television commercial for Heat was directed by Jake Nava, who previously directed Beyonc√©'s videos for her singles \\"Crazy In Love\\", \\"Baby Boy\\", \\"Beautiful Liar\\", \\"If I Were a Boy\\", and \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\". Trey Laird was the executive creative director, while Hans Dorsinville was the creative director of the video. Laird stated that the main theme of the commercial was that Beyonc√© should appear \\"sexy and a little bit dangerous\\", but in a \\"sophisticated and elegant way\\". Released on television channels in December 2009, the commercial is set to Beyonc√©'s cover version of \\"Fever\\" (2010) playing in the background. It features her in the same red satin kimono that she has worn on the print advertisement. Beyonc√© is seen sweating profusely in a steamy bathroom while in one of the scenes, she is seen seemingly enjoying herself in a bath. Nava praised Beyonc√©'s acting in the commercial, stating: \\"She's so scorchingly hot that even when she touches the floor with her dangerous high-heels, she kind of sets her world on fire.\\" In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, Beyonc√© described the sexual tone of the video stating: \\"'It's called Heat, so we wanted the ads to be really steamy and dewy. My sexiest moments are when I'm just getting out of the tub or the shower and I'm clean, so I wanted to incorporate that in the ads. The dress was this liquid-y satin. The song Fever I did years ago and always loved it. [For the commercial] I got to sing it a bit more whispery, more natural.\\" \\"Fever\\" was re-recorded by Beyonc√© on two different occasions. Knowles first recorded her version of \\"Fever\\" on September 9, 2003 for her film The Fighting Temptations. Before the release of Heat, she recorded \\"Fever\\" again for the fragrance's television commercial. After the launch of Heat, the latter version of the song was officially released as a promotional single to the US iTunes Store through Columbia Records on February 8, 2010, to promote the fragrance. It was made available digitally in the United Kingdom the following day. The commercial for the fragrance found controversy in the United Kingdom with UK's Advertising Standards Authority. It was banned from the country's daytime TV rotation due to its \\"sexy imagery\\" and was only shown after 7:30 in the afternoon. The U.K.'s Advertising Standards Authority commented on the ban decision, stating \\"We considered that Beyonc√©'s body movements and the camera's prolonged focus on shots of her dress slipping away to partially expose her breasts created a sexually provocative ad that was unsuitable to be seen by young children.\\" Coty, Inc., the world's largest fragrance company, replied to the ban, stating that they do not think there is anything too explicit about the TV spot. Coty continued that the commercial was \\"intended to reflect the singer Beyonc√©'s personal 'sexy chic' style,\\" and while Beyonc√©'s cleavage is exposed at certain parts of the commercial, Coty stated that it is not \\"overtly graphic or explicitly sexual and at no point was Beyonc√© naked.\\" Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly defended Beyonc√©, saying that \\"[the advertisement] is sexy. It's suggestive and sultry. But it's certainly not X-rated.\\" Beyonc√©'s mother and collaborator Tina Knowles called the commercial's ban \\"very good\\", as people purposely went to watch the video which further increased sales. Reception A model holding a bottle of Heat during its release in Brazil Amy Odell of New York magazine gave Heat's scent a negative review. She criticized the fragrance's packaging as being very similar to that of K-Y Jelly. She stated: \\"Once on the skin, the scent transformed in a matter of just a few minutes from something floral-y and vaguely acceptable to an offensive mix of car fumes and that vanilla body spray Victoria's Secret used to sell to 12-year-olds\\", then adding that the perfume's logo and gold swirls \\"sway too similar to that of KY Jelly's\\", before concluding that \\"calling to mind sex is kind of Beyonc√©'s thing, which is why this fragrance could just be a smashing success.\\" Holly Siegel of The New York Times complimented the fragrance's scent of \\"floral-fruity-woody blend and notes of neroli, almond and tonka bean.\\" On October 25, 2010, the perfume won a gold status at the Design of the Times Awards by The Strive Group. At the 2011 CEW Beauty Awards, Heat won in the category for Best Fragrance of the Year: Mass. The same year, it also won in the category for Best Fragrance at the Dutch Drugstore Awards, and Best Fragrance in the Lifestyle at the Norwegian Cosmetic Awards. It also received a nomination in the category for Media Campaign of the Year at the 2011 FiFi Awards. It was revealed by Macy's Chief executive officer, Terry Lundgren, that his chain had sold US$3 million worth of Heat between early February 2010 and early March 2010. Lundgren revealed that, during a one-hour period at the launch of the scent when Beyonc√© was at the store signing autographs, 72,000 bottles were sold. Within days of the fragrance's release, it was named as one of the best- selling scents in America. According to The Fragrance Shop in the UK, Heat also topped a poll of best-selling celebrity scents. Related products During an interview with Women's Wear Daily in December 2009, Stephen Mormoris announced that Beyonc√© planned to release several other fragrances after Heat meant to explore the different sides of her personality. However, he added that Heat was meant to be \\"the enduring classic... this scent will re-energize the celebrity category\\". Consequently, five additional fragrances were released from the Heat line: Heat Ultimate Elixir, Heat Rush, Midnight Heat, Heat: The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour and Heat Wild Orchid. In 2013, it was revealed that with $400 million earned at retail globally, the line of perfumes was placed at number three on the list of best-selling fragrances. The Heat releases further became the best-selling line of celebrity endorsed fragrances. Mormois discussed his collaboration with Beyonc√© on the Heat line, saying: \\"Beyonc√© has always chosen simple and strong concepts for her fragrances. She's very collaborative in that she know[s] what she wants and she has a very clear view of her fan base. There are just a few of that qualities that make her an excellent partner. She is excellent at making decisions and making them happen.\\" In September 2011, Beyonc√© followed Heat with a new line of fragrances titled Beyonc√© Pulse. Heat Ultimate Elixir In August 2010, it was revealed that Beyonc√© would be re-releasing her first fragrance as an \\"ultimate elixir\\", emphasizing elements intended to embody her private side. The scent was released in September 2010. As its theme, the perfume offers a more intense and sensual version of the original Heat scent. Upon revealing the inspiration of Heat Ultimate Elixir, Beyonc√© stated that the reason which motivated her to update the original scent was the idea of her mother's scent when she was a child: > My first memory of fragrance is my mother, and as a very young girl, hearing > her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor > and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it would > just stay in the room.

Ultimate Elixir mixes notes of vanilla orchid and osmanthus top notes with cedarwood and amber middle notes, then adds in vanilla and tonka bean base notes. Kelly Bryant of StyleList wrote that the base notes of Heat Ultimate Elixir \\"drive the point home that this is a bouquet meant for one sexy siren\\". Selling the scent's elixir, Macy's described the fragrance as an \\"opulent and intoxicating twist on the original scent.\\" Keeping with the scent's \\"sexy theme\\", the new scarlet jus is contained in the original bottle, updated with a black atomizer, which has been described as \\"boudoir-ready\\" by Katherine Kluznik Rentmeester of People magazine. Nathalie Atkinson of The National Post held a sniff test for the Heat Ultimate Elixir perfume to assess the different scents picked up by people of the opposite sex. Cosmetics editor Dave Lackie, who was asked to be the male participant of the scent, described the elixir as \\"stronger than the original\\", noting strong hints in scents such as \\"peach- flavoured candy paired with nondescript flowers\\" which offered \\"a nice drydown\\". Atkinson, the female participant, noted Beyonc√©'s intense use of creamsicle, adding that the scent holds strong enough \\"to get noticed above the hairspray fumes and thumping bass\\". In a list of \\"Noseworthy Perfumes\\", Oprah Winfrey listed Heat Ultimate Elixir at number two, favoring the fragrance's \\"honeysuckle nectar, musk, and warm, sensual\\" sequoia scent. The Independent described the scent as a \\"spicier flanker\\" in comparison to the original release. New York magazine found the fragrance's packaging \\"just as 'lubelike' as the original.\\" Products * 50 ml/ 1.7 oz Heat Rush New fragrance project working sessions for Heat Rush took place backstage in Newcastle upon Tyne, England in November 2009 and the fragrance was released in February 2011. During the new fragrance project working sessions, Beyonc√© deciphered through different scents, later choosing a \\"Sunset Cocktail Mod 5\\" scent because it made her feel \\"as though a breeze were coming through the room\\" and seemed \\"like more of a risk\\". Beyonc√©'s official perfume website described Heat Rush as a fruity, floral fragrance \\"that is luminous and vibrant with a dewy delicacy at the same time... It captures Beyonc√©'s bright sensuality; it's young, fresh, and joyful.\\" The same source listed the scent's top notes as passion fruit, orange and cherry; the middle notes meant to embody \\"Beyonc√©'s ultra-feminine side\\" with orchid, mango and orange hibiscus; and the base notes contain teak, honey and a musk blend that was said to be inspired by sunsets in Brazil. Heat: Limited edition CD A limited edition gift extended play (EP) also titled Heat was released in February 2011, almost a year after the promotional release of \\"Fever\\". Promotion in the United States for the perfume took place with a free tote bag, while the limited edition gift EP was used as promotion for all United Kingdom releases of the perfume. One compact disc copy of the EP was included with every purchase of a 50 ml bottle of Heat.

Plot summary In the beginning of this adventure, the player characters set off in search of the city of Quagmire. The characters must travel through a monster-infested swamp to get to the city, which is being slowly swallowed into the sea. Quagmire is a whelk-shaped \\"spiral city\\", built by a dead race in the Serpent Peninsula. The module includes a description of the city. The player characters stumble upon a message in a bottle sent by the king of Quagmire, desperately requesting their help in overcoming the oppressive lizard men who hold them captive. Publication history X6 Quagmire! was written by Merle M. Rasmussen, with cover art by Steve Peregrine, and was published by TSR in 1984 as a 32-page booklet with an outer folder. The module featured interior art by Jeffrey Butler.Rasmussen, Merle M. Quagmire! (TSR, 1984) The scenario was written for the Expert Rules. Reception Rick Swan reviewed the adventure in The Space Gamer No. 72. He commented that \\"Just when you thought adventure modules had exhausted every conceivable variation on dungeon design, along comes Quagmire with its 13-level cities in the shape of gigantic spiral seashells.\\" Swan continued: \\"Quagmire is perfect for DMs who balk at the thought of having to absorb pages of background information before they can run an adventure. Since all of the preliminary information is contained in a few paragraphs and the plot itself is very simple, a DM could conceivably have his adventurers on the road within a few minutes of his first reading. Most of the module concerns the journey to the spiral cities, a trip that may involve travel across deserts, swamps, and the open sea. Designer Merle Rasmussen has provided dozens of encounters to spice up the journey, neatly addressing a fundamental problem of many wilderness adventures: how to keep the party occupied while they travel long distances. Though it sounds gimmicky, the spiral cities setting is also a nice change of pace from the usual underground dungeons and haunted houses.\\" He added: \\"Quagmire suffers from one of the most common failings of roleplaying modules, the anti-climactic ending. After hours or days of working through an adventure, players have the right to expect a big finish to make all their trials and tribulations worthwhile. Though the architecture is interesting, there's not much going on in the spiral cities, and rescuing the good guys involved little more than beating up the bad guys. The encounters along the way are generally good ones, but they're also totally unrelated to the purpose of the mission.\\" Swan concluded his review by saying: \\"Quagmire isn't particularly engaging for either players or DM. The flimsy story line that makes it easy to run also makes it ultimately a drag to play. It should be notes, however, that the extensive wilderness section has a lot of useful ideas and imaginative encounters that could easily be used elsewhere. \\"Quagmire makes a good supplement, but as a self-contained adventure, it's not much.\\" Graham Staplehurst reviewed Quagmire! for White Dwarf, and gave it 8/10 overall, calling it \\"a useful acquisition for any D&D; player, particularly as a first excursion into a fully fledged wilderness.\\" Staplehurst praised the module, stating that it \\"promotes a whole 'experience', a total environment and ecosystem, with background colour and depth which more localised scenarios and modules lack. The designers have done a good job in describing large areas of wild lands, giving inspiration and yet not pedantic detail to DMs with players itching to see a bit of their characters' world and feel it come to life.\\" He called the eponymous city a \\"superb piece of original design\\", although he noted that DMs running the scenario \\"will want to dress up the city a little to add to the scenario as it is a little sparsely populated\\". Staplehurst concluded the review stating, \\"The weather, the fatigue of travel, disease, the question of provisions, etc, all play a major part in the characters' concerns, and this increases enjoyment of the game no end. A very good scenario.\\" In his 1991 book Heroic Worlds, Lawrence Schick provides an alliterative summary of the scenario: \\"Sea slowly swallows seashell-shaped swamp city\\". Games historian Jon Peterson used Quagmire! as the subject of a detailed study of TSR's internal operations during the height of the Dungeons & Dragons fad in the 1980s, showing how staff designers moved projects from concept briefs to story boards and drafts up to publication.Quagmire!

The band seldom conformed to a single style of music, quoting themselves as 'experimental Rock/Metal/Goth'. Their lyrical themes covered a range of topics such as love, frustration, sadness and personal struggle, as well as hope in finding beauty in a bleak world. The band was always keen to try new ideas, stating that they believed \\"that music shall be created via lust, curiosity and joy\\". The Provenance ran from 1995 to December 2008, where the band announced on their MySpace page that a mutual decision to split up had taken place: > \\"We all felt it would be wrong to continue our musical endeavors within a > concept that sadly grew tired and weary to us...We thought it better to call > it quits while we were at our peak rather than push forward making a new > album that would undoubtedly have lowered the flag at half staff.\\" The band released a series of demos, followed by four full-length studio albums, one of which released a single. Their last album, Red Flags, received good reviews from critics, and was called 'harrowingly seductive' by Terrorizer Magazine. A track from Red Flags called 'At The Barricades' was featured on the Metal Hammer Peaceville Records promo sampler in 2006.

Viewpoint  According to Indologist Michael Witzel, there is a recent tendency of indigenously minded revisionism and rewriting of India's history and archeology in scholarly publications, media, the Internet and government publications. This Indocentric rewriting includes claims that the first human civilization in the world formed in India in c. 10,000 BC, that there is an uninterrupted continuity of the Indian civilization from 7500 BC to present, and that Indo-European speaking Europe was populated by the immigrant people from the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Responses of other countries=Sri Lanka Much of Sri Lanka's early history has been described as having an Indocentric bias. This Indocentric bias in understanding Sri Lankan history led to a trend of Sri Lankan historians breaking away from the Indocentric bias in Sri Lankan history and instead focusing on Sri Lanka's historical and cultural links with Southeast Asia, which the country had close ties to. One of the most famous historians to break the Indocentric view of Sri Lankan history was Senarath Paranavithana who focused on Sri Lanka's connection with the Malay Peninsula and the rest of the Malay Archipelago. He established the \\"Malaya theory\\", claiming Sri Lanka's history with Kalinga was with the Kalingga Kingdom of Central Java, Indonesia and not with the Kalinga kingdom of eastern India.

The humanitarian response by national governments to the 2010 Haiti earthquake included numerous national governments from around the world pledging to send humanitarian aid to the Haitian people. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and ReliefWeb are coordinating and tracking this aid. More than six months later after the earthquake, less than one-tenth of the money that was pledged by foreign governments to the United Nations special fund for the Haiti quake was actually received. of all the nations that had pledged money to this fund only 20 countries had actually sent any money: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States. Others have sent supplies and/or personnel instead of money, and/or they pledged or sent money outside of the UN channels. Initial pledges of assistance were tracked by the US Congressional Research Service. In 2015, the United Nations reported that US$13.34 billion had been earmarked for Haiti through 2020, though in the two years following the quake, less than half of that amount had been deployed.

A medical assistance station has been set up by the Chinese rescue team in Port-au-Prince. On 21 January 2010, China donated an additional US$2.6 million and sent a 40-member medical care and epidemic prevention team. Japan: After the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake, the Japanese government plans to offer up to in grant aid, which will be exercised through international organizations including UNICEF and the World Food Programme (WFP). It will also donate emergency relief materials for as much as ¬•30 million (). The Japanese Ministry of Defense deployed a disaster relief team (JDRT). The Japanese government sent a C-130 Hercules from Arizona with a 26 member-JDRT team and emergency relief goods stocked in Florida to Haiti. The medical team arrived at L√©og√¢ne, 30 km west of Port-au-Prince, and started its operation on 18 January 2010. The International Disaster Relief Medical Support Unit relieved JDRT of their activities in L√©og√¢ne. South Korea: South Korean National Emergency Management Agency immediately dispatched team of 35 rescue workers. They set up a clinic in Port-au-Prince. In January 2010, an additional 10-member team was sent to review the area and determine on-site needs. In March 2010, South Korea sent in a further 250 member force to Haiti for a United Nations (UN)-led peacekeeping mission to help rebuild. South Korea has provided a total of over in aid, which is by far the largest aid package from East Asia, making it one of the main contributors of humanitarian aid to Haiti. The large-scale relief effort is seen to reflect the South Korea's determination to actively join the international efforts. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak hinted that additional assistance was on its way in a telephone conversation with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on 16 January 2010, and it sent an immediate aid package as the first batch, and provided over worth of aid on the second batch. About the two-thirds came directly from the South Korean government in the form of short and long-term aid, while the rest was the result of collective efforts from the private sector. Private organizations raised the another US$2 million for Haiti. Southeast Asia Brunei: The Government of Brunei has pledged or gave US$50,000 in aid to Haiti. Cambodia: The Royal Cambodian government contributed . Indonesia: Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said Indonesia would send aid workers to help Haiti earthquake victims.

The remaining 25 are experts in construction and telecommunications. The Indonesian government will also send five tonnes of medical supplies, five tonnes of food, and five tonnes of special equipment and tools. The aid was airlifted by a Lion Air 747-400 jumbo jet. The aircraft was diverted to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic due to heavy air traffic in Haiti.

The Philippine Government has also donated US$50,000. Singapore: The Singaporean government donated to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Thailand: After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the Thai Government had initially decided to donate for humanitarian assistance in Haiti. Such amount of money gained heavy criticism that it was too little, while Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban remarked, \\"That was the first amount of money we could give, but more will come. We may send our military army engineers to join the world, following assessment of the situations. The problem is that Haiti is too far from us, unlike the cases having occurred in our neighbours such as Indonesia or the Philippines. What we could do for Haiti is only donation of money or personnel.\\" Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Thai Queen Sirikit also sent a missive of condolences to Haitian President Rene Preval. Following that, the Council of Ministers resolved to send another , which was later extended to , and 20,000 tonnes of rice. Deputy Education Minister Chaiwuti Bannawat said in a cabinet meeting that medical teams from many educational institutes under his ministry were ready to go to Haiti, but needed funding from the government. While Thai Foreign Minister Kasit Piromya proposed to have his ministry co-ordinate the relief effort, but also the Natural Resources and Environment Minister Suwit Khunkitti offered to personally take the aid to the affected country. However, all was turned down by Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, citing that money and rice was enough for the moment. Vietnam: Vietnam donated to support relief efforts. Oceania Australia: The Australian government pledged $10 million in immediate aid funding. Australian Government increased aid with additional $5 million to meet urgent and emergency humanitarian needs such as food, water and sanitation, shelter and medical assistance.

Background and early career  It is not known when Li Chan was born. He was a member of Tang Dynasty's imperial Li clan, being a descendant of Li Hu (ÊùéËôé), the grandfather of Tang's founding emperor Emperor Gaozu who was a general during Northern Zhou and carried the title of Duke of Tang, through Li Hu's son Li Yi (ÊùéÁ¶ï) the Duke of Changping. (As Emperor Gaozu, after founding Tang, posthumously created Li Yi the Prince of Xun, Li Yi's branch of the imperial clan line became known as the Prince of Xun Branch.) Li Chan was a sixth-generation descendant of Li Yi's son Li Shuliang (ÊùéÂèîËâØ) the Prince of Changping.New Book of Tang, vol. 70.Li Hui's biography in the New Book of Tang indicated that he was a sixth-generation descendant of another son of Li Yi's, Li Deliang (ÊùéÂæ∑ËâØ) the Prince of Xinxing, but as this account conflicts with the more comprehensive family tree listing in the table of the chancellors' family trees, it appeared to have been in error. See New Book of Tang, vol. 131. Both Li Chan's grandfather Li Jun'e (ÊùéÂ≥ªÂ¥ø) and father Li Ruxian (ÊùéÂ¶Ç‰ªô) served as county magistrates. Early in the Changqing era (821-824) of Emperor Muzong, Li Chan passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class, and he later passed a special imperial examination for those with good tactics. He thereafter served on the staffs of military governors (Jiedushi) of Yicheng Circuit (Áæ©Êàê, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan) and then Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). He was later recalled to the capital Chang'an, initially to be the census officer at the Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, i.e., the Chang'an region) government, and then as the officer in charge of military rolls. He was later promoted to be Bujue (Ë£úÈóï), a low-level advisory official in the imperial government, as well as imperial chronicler (Ëµ∑Â±ÖÈÉé, Qiju Lang). It was said that he was capable in all matters he handled, and particularly impressed the chancellor Li Deyu.Old Book of Tang, vol. 173.As context indicates that this was referring to Li Deyu's first term as chancellor, rather than his much longer second term, this would have been referring to a time period from 833 to 834. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 174. He was later made Zhifang Yuanwailang (ËÅ∑ÊñπÂì°Â§ñÈÉé), a low-level official at the ministry of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®, Bingbu), but was also put in charge of handling matters for the ministry of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®, Hubu). He later served as Libu Yuanwailang (ÂêèÈÉ®Âì°Â§ñÈÉé), a low-level official at the ministry of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, Libu), but was also put in charge of serving as assisting the minister directly. Yet later he served as Xingbu Yuanwailang (ÂàëÈÉ®Âì°Â§ñÈÉé), a low-level official at the ministry of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®, Xingbu), but was also put in charge of the administrative affairs of the Office of Imperial Censors (Âæ°Âè≤Ëá∫, Yushi Tai). Early in the Kaicheng era (836-840) of Emperor Muzong's son Emperor Wenzong, he was promoted to be Kubu Langzhong (Â∫´ÈÉ®ÈÉé‰∏≠), a supervisory official at the ministry of census, and was also put in charge of drafting imperial edicts. He was then promoted to be Zhongshu Sheren (‰∏≠Êõ∏Ëàç‰∫∫), a mid- level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng).  During Emperor Wuzong's reign  Emperor Wenzong died in 840 and was succeeded by his brother Emperor WuzongZizhi Tongjian, vol. 246. ‚Äî and as Emperor Wuzong was named Li Chan (ÊùéÁÄç), albeit a different character than Li Chan's name, Li Chan changed his name to Li Hui to observe naming taboo. Li Deyu became lead chancellor, and thereafter, Li Hui became deputy minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Gongbu Shilang), then deputy minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Hubu Shilang). In 843, he was also made deputy chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤‰∏≠‰∏û, Yushi Zhongcheng). As of 843, Emperor Wuzong was preparing a major campaign against the warlord Liu Zhen, who had taken control of Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi) without imperial sanction after the death of his adoptive father (and biological uncle) Liu Congjian, who had served as Zhaoyi's military governor. Concerned that the three de facto independent circuits north of the Yellow River ‚Äî Weibo (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), then governed by He Hongjing; Chengde (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), then governed by Wang Yuankui; and Lulong (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing), then governed by Zhang Zhongwu ‚Äî would side with Zhaoyi, Emperor Wuzong sent Li Hui to those three circuits to express to them that the imperial government had no intent to intervene in their internal affairs, so as long as they sided with the imperial government in the campaign against Zhaoyi. It was said that Li Hui was capable in speaking and persuasion, and all three circuits accepted the imperial orders.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 247. (It was also said that part of Li Hui's mission was to alleviate the adversarial relationship between Zhang and one of the imperial generals, Liu Mian (ÂäâÊ≤î) the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Li Hui's biographies in the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang indicated that that part of the mission was successful,New Book of Tang, vol. 131. but the Zizhi Tongjian indicated that he was unsuccessful, causing Emperor Wuzong to eventually transfer Liu Mian away to avoid creating complications in the Zhaoyi campaign.) While the Zhaoyi campaign was going on, Emperor Wuzong's administration was also dealing with Dangxiang incursions. Under Li Deyu's proposal, which Emperor Wuzong accepted, Emperor Wuzong's son Li Qi (ÊùéÂ≤ê) the Prince of Yan was nominally made the supreme commander over six circuits (i.e., the six circuits affected by the Dangxiang incursions) and chief comforter of the Danxiang. Li Hui was made the deputy commander, to be in actual command of the operations, working with Zheng Ya (ÈÑ≠‰∫û), who was made the secretary general. In 844, after Liu Zhen was killed by his own officer Guo Yi (ÈÉ≠Ë™º), who then surrendered Zhaoyi to the imperial forces, Li Deyu wanted to use the opportunity to carry out reprisals against his political enemies, the former chancellors Li Zongmin and Niu Sengru, and therefore, even though no evidence was found at Zhaoyi that Li Zongmin and Niu were in secret communications with Liu Congjian, had Liu Congjian's secretary Zheng Qing (ÈÑ≠ÊÖ∂) claim that Liu Congjian would burn letters from Li Zongmin and Niu after reading them. Emperor Wuzong had Zheng report to the Office of the Imperial Censors, and subsequently, Li Hui and Zheng Ya, handling the investigations, indicated that they believed Zheng Qing's accusations. In anger, Emperor Wuzong had Li Zongmin and Niu exiled.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 248. In 845, Li Hui was made Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the legislative bureau, and chancellor de facto with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã). He also continued to oversee the ministry of census.  During Emperor XuƒÅnzong's reign  Emperor Wuzong died in 846 and was succeeded by his uncle Emperor XuƒÅnzong. As Emperor XuƒÅnzong despised Li Deyu for his hold on power, he had Li Deyu removed from his chancellor post and sent out of the capital. Li Hui, meanwhile, remained as chancellor and oversaw the building of Emperor Wuzong's tomb, but in 847 was also sent out of the capital to serve as the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan). That winter, with Li Deyu accused of having wrongly killed Wu Xiang (Âê≥Êπò) on charges of corruption and forced marriage with a commoner ‚Äî a case that both Li Hui and Zheng Ya were both involved in reviewing and affirming the death sentence of ‚Äî Li Hui was demoted to be the governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Hunan Circuit (ÊπñÂçó, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan) and prefect of its capital Tan Prefecture (in modern Changsha, Hunan). Emperor XuƒÅnzong was then set to further give him the empty title of Taizi Binke (Â§™Â≠êË≥ìÂÆ¢), an advisor to the Crown Prince (there being no crown prince at the time) and having his office at the eastern capital Luoyang,Edict Demoting Li Hui to be Taizi Binke with Office at the Eastern Capital, All Tang Texts (ÂÖ®ÂîêÊñá), vol. 79. when an imperial attendant objected to it as being an overly lenient punishment. Li Hui was thereafter demoted to be the prefect of Fu Prefecture (Êí´Â∑û, in modern Fuzhou, Jiangxi). (It was from Emperor XuƒÅnzong's edict that it could be attested that Li Hui carried the title of Duke of Longxi, which was not otherwise mentioned in his biographies.)  Divergent accounts of late career and death  It is from this point on that the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang accounts substantially diverged as to the rest of Li Hui's career and life. According to the Old Book of Tang, after the main chancellors of Emperor XuƒÅnzong's reign, Bai Minzhong and Linghu Tao, were no longer chancellors ‚Äî which would probably mean sometime around 861, during the reign of Emperor XuƒÅnzong's son Emperor Yizong, as that was the end of Bai's second term as chancellor,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 250. Li Hui was recalled to Chang'an to serve as the minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Bingbu Shangshu), and then again sent out to Xichuan to serve as its military governor. He died there and was given posthumous honors, including the posthumous name of Wenyi (ÊñáÊáø, \\"civil and benevolent\\"). The New Book of Tang, however, indicated that Li Hui died at Fu Prefecture, and that in 855 Emperor XuƒÅnzong, still emperor at that point, posthumously restored the offices of governor of Hunan and ministry of defense to him.

It was written by Graeme Morris and Tom Kirby and published by TSR. Plot summary Drums on Fire Mountain is a scenario describing a jungle island, and the ancient tunnels beneath its volcanic mountain. The seaways southeast of Thyatis have never been safe, but now it appears that legends of green-skinned pirates and strange living fogs are true. Shipping is being disrupted and an expedition to discover the cause returned crippled with just one prisoner. This scenario is set southeast of a major empire, on a volcanic island geographically isolated and unrelated to the other powers in the world. The player characters are given a full briefing by the Master of the Seafaring Merchants Guild, and then set off to face a vicious tribe of green-skinned demi-humans who worship a pig \\"god\\". Publication history X8 Drums on Fire Mountain was published by TSR in 1984 as a 32-page booklet with an outer folder, and was written by Graeme Morris and Tom Kirby, with art by Brian Williams. The module features additional artwork by Paul Ruiz.Morris, Graeme, and Tom Kirby. Drums on Fire Mountain (TSR, 1984) The scenario was written for the Expert Rules. Reception Wendy J. Rose reviewed the module for Imagine magazine, giving it a positive review. She thought that \\"DMs will love X8\\" as no matter where the players wander on the island, something has been provided for them. According to Rose, the gamemaster does not have to push the players in any specific direction - they will find their way by themselves and \\"have plenty of fun on the way\\". When they have finally reached the 'dungeon' the players find themselves in \\"an exciting adventure with lots of interesting little twists and details\\". Rose noted that the setting is fantastical but \\"more believable\\" than Castle Amber. On the downside, Rose noted that the opportunities for roleplaying are limited as many encounters are of the 'attack on sight' variety, which could cause the players to miss out on lots of cultural details the module provides. As to the dungeon, Rose praised the good effect to which the third dimension (up and down) is being used. She felt that \\"a fair amount of brain as well as brawn\\" would be needed to really enjoy this module, as its complexities could leave players with only a limited idea of what is going on. Rose finished by saying that the module contains enough material for at least two good gaming sessions and that it is rewarding in terms of loot as well as enjoyment. She called it \\"worth a try\\". Graham Staplehurst reviewed Drums on Fire Mountain for White Dwarf, and gave it 8/10 overall, calling it \\"Another welcome addition to the range of D&D; scenarios\\". Staplehurst noted that Graeme Morris and Tom Kirby are designers from TSR UK (and that Graeme's name is misspelt on the front cover). He felt that the module \\"has a mainly Polynesian flavour, with a hint of Amerind and African overtones\\", making the setting \\"ideal for translation into any on-going campaign\\". Staplehurst felt that the module \\"contains a lot of thoughtful detail and plenty of attention has been paid to the society, history and the whole atmosphere of the island. There are many exciting (and even humourous ) encounters and players and DM alike should find the scenario very satisfying.\\" He concluded the review by stating that \\"Intelligence has been used in developing the scenario's rationale and balancing it in favour of player skills and enjoyment. Highly recommended.\\" According to Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book Heroic Worlds, the scenario \\"Includes a magic-using devil-swine, so how can you beat it?\\" References Category:Dungeons & Dragons modules Category:Mystara ","title":"Drums on Fire Mountain"},{"id":"25834270","text":"Verde Pulgar (Spanish for green thumb) is a software application concept that assists the user in understanding proper yard and garden maintenance.

Nottingham based label In At the Deep End Records were due to attend their band The Killerest Expression's show in Leeds when Hitechjet were added to the bill. Although this was only their second show, based on their performance that night offered Hitechjet a recording contract. If you take anything In June 2003 Hitechjet released, 'If you take anything...', a 7 track mini-album which received critical acclaim in many magazines and fanzines including Kerrang (4K), Big Cheese (4/5) and Drowned in Sound (9/10). This led to shows with Lagwagon, Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly, Kasabian, Instruction, Red Animal War, Million Dead amongst others. 600 miles from... The album was recorded, engineered and produced by longtime producer John Hannon. The album was presented to In At the Deep End Records in October 2004. A 14-date first UK headline tour was booked for February 2005 to coincide with the release of the album. Artwork problems delayed the release of the album, and this led to Hitechjet leaving for their tour with their friends Driving on the Right without an album to promote. This was their most successful tour to date with several shows selling out. Due to a busy release schedule, In At the Deep End Records finally released \\"600 miles from...\\" in October 2005. Although Hitechjet were known for their \\"genre hopping\\" style, '600 miles from...' explored new areas for Hitechjet with elements of post rock, electronica and post punk and contained heavy use of samples. The album was greeted with more critical acclaim receiving 8/10 in Rock Sound, 5/5 Big Cheese, 5/5 Zero Magazine, 4.5/5 Punktastic.com amongst them. After playing 'Making Movies' regularly on his show, Radio One DJ Mike Davies, invited Hitechjet to record a session for the Lock Up show at the end of 2005. They played live '(I should have left you at the) Roadside', 'Perfect Video (full band version)', 'This Lift goes down' and 'As though nothing happened'. In April 2006, after touring with The Once Over Twice, Hitechjet's frustrations with their future and their label was beginning to cause tensions within the band. Hitechjet decided to go on an \\"indefinite hiatus\\". In July 2012, Hitechjet reformed for two one off shows in London.

She was noteworthy for being selected by Henry Honychurch Gorringe for the purpose of transporting the Cleopatra's Needle Obelisk from Egypt to New York City. She was sold to Ocean Steam Company in 1880 and renamed Dessoug. She served between New York and Savanna for her final years. In 1896 she sailed to Cow Bay, Long Island and broken up for scrap.https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9905E2DA1E3AE533A25750C2A96E9C94679ED7CF History Denton was built in Hartlepool England in 1864 for the Khedive of Egypt. She was selected by Henry Honychurch Gorringe for the purpose of transporting the Cleopatra's Needle Obelisk from Egypt to New York City. Realizing that lifting a roughly 200-ton stone up and placing it down into the cargo hold was beyond the technology of the day (and placing it as top-heavy deck cargo would capsize the ship), Gorringe devised a novel loading method. He had the ship moved to a sturdy dry dock. Then, he had a by hole cut in her starboard bow --and the obelisk would be slid along horizontally right into the ship's interior. Cannonballs were used as bearings to move the obelisk inside. Thus loaded and the bow planks replaced, she left on 12 June 1880 for the United States. During the voyage her propeller shaft broke and was replaced using a spare while she was under sail power from shore. (The obelisk in London also called Cleopatra's Needle was of similar weight; it was shipped in a purpose-built temporary vessel, the Cleopatra.) She was later used between New York and Savannah until she was scrapped in 1890.

The company was incorporated February 12, 1898, by David Eccles, Charles W. Nibley, and George Stoddard. A shareholder meeting was held on February 26, 1898 in Baker City, Oregon, and a factory was built in La Grande, Oregon, thereafter. Eccles was president of the company and the board of directors included Thomas R. Cutler, Nibley, Stoddard and William Eccles. The factory was built by the E. H. Dyer Construction Company of Cleveland, Ohio, and was \\"almost identical\\" to the layout of Amalgamated's Ogden factory. The sugar beet refining factory in La Grande was built in 1898 and Oregon Sugar also founded the company town of Nibley, Oregon, where Mormons raised sugar beets for the factory. By 1904, due to farmer reluctance, Oregon Sugar began farming sugar beets directly, after purchasing of land. The region was never very productive for sugar beets, and closing the factory was seriously considered in 1907. An outside expert was brought in who made a \\"very voluminous report\\", which confirmed the area was not likely to become more productive, even with changes. In 1908, the factory only operated on 28 days due to low yields, and a special committee was appointed to plan for the removal of the factory. The factory, \\"a mistake from the beginning and soon recognized as such\\", was shuttered in 1912. The only reason the factory was not removed sooner was the need for a new location for the machinery. An 1898 account of the sugar factory was published in the La Grande Daily Chronicle: :The main building has 320 tons of structural steel and upwards of 1500 tons of machinery‚Ä¶The beets as they come from the shed are carried to the factory in a stream of water; they are then thoroughly washed and elevated to the upper part of the building, where they go through a slicing machine. After being sliced they go into a battery of cells, which are heated by steam, and the juice is extracted from the pulp by a process called \\"diffusion,\\" which is exactly the same as extracting the essence of coffee from the berry or of tea from the leaves.

It currently carries Amtrak and Metro-North Railroad trains over the Norwalk River. In 1896, the New Haven Railroad built the bridge and widened its route to four tracks, as it simultaneously built its South Norwalk Railroad Bridge over the intersection of Washington Street with North Main and South Main streets. The span, with a rotating swing span long was provided by the Berlin Iron Bridge Co. This type of swing bridge is one of just two on the Northeast Corridor. and The swing span has a rim-bearing system of 96 rollers, allowing tall vessels to pass by. The span is one of only 13 of the company's bridges (and one of only two railroad bridges) that survive in the state as of August 2001. In 1907 the rail line was electrified with overhead catenary wires, which form a prominent feature of the bridge today. It is or was also known as Norwalk River Bridge. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. It is one of eight moveable bridges on the Amtrak route through Connecticut surveyed in one multiple property study in 1986. The eight bridges from west to east are: Mianus River Railroad Bridge at Cos Cob, built in 1904; the Norwalk River Railroad Bridge at Norwalk, 1896; Saugatuck River Railroad Bridge at Westport, 1905; Pequonnock River Railroad Bridge at Bridgeport, 1902; Housatonic River Railroad Bridge, at Devon, 1905; Connecticut River Railroad Bridge, Old Saybrook-Old Lyme, 1907; Niantic River Bridge, East Lyme- Waterford, 1907; and Thames River Bridge (Amtrak), Groton, built in 1919. As a single movable span with aging mechanical mechanisms, the Norwalk River Bridge represents a frequent point of failure for Amtrak and Metro-North service and has been targeted for replacement with dual movable spans. The final design approved for the new Walk Bridge calls for a dual-span vertical-lift bridge.

As Oregon was aligned with the union states during the American Civil War, a railroad connection was proposed to help supply the Union and build morale. Early proposals A map of Willamette Valley rail lines from 1919. Byron J. Pengra, the Surveyor General of Oregon from 1862 to 1865, secured a federal land grant in 1864 for the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road from Eugene to Owyhee, and proposed a railroad along this line, then joining the transcontinental railroad near Winnemucca, Nevada. Pengra incorporated a company in 1867 but failed due to lack of financial support. William Williams Chapman, Surveyor General of Oregon from 1857 to 1861, proposed a railroad along the Oregon Trail from Portland, over the Blue Mountains, along the Snake River, then south to the transcontinental railroad at Salt Lake City. Chapman created the Portland, Dalles and Salt Lake Railroad Company in 1881, then reincorporated it as the Portland, Salt Lake and Salt Pass Railroad Company in 1876. He attempted to raise funds for this company in the eastern United States as well as England. Both Pengra and Chapman's companies were hampered by the Cr√©dit Mobilier of America scandal in 1872. Rail routes to follow the Oregon Trail were surveyed by the government, Union Pacific, and others, including James H. Slater and Dan Chapman's Grande Ronde Valley and Columbia River Valley Construction Company in 1874, and the Blue Mountain and Columbia River Rail- Road Company's narrow gauge effort. The wooden-railed narrow-gauge Walla Walla and Columbia River Railroad, established in 1868, involved several overland portages. Henry Villard Henry Villard was sent by German investors to oversee their investments in the Oregon and California Railroad Company, then became the major force in railroading for the region. In 1879, he purchased the Oregon Steam Navigation Company and the Oregon Steamship Company, merging them to the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (OR&N;). Since Union Pacific and Central Pacific had an uneasy agreement due to owning the western and eastern halves of the Transcontinental Railroad, Vilard approached Union Pacific with an alternative to using the Central Pacific line from Salt Lake City to San Francisco. He offered a 50% partnership in the OR&N; in 1879. Union was already building an extension from Brigham City, Utah to Butte, Montana that could be extended west. Central Pacific threatened Union Pacific if such an arrangement was made, which ended it immediately. Northern Pacific had a line reaching from the Dakotas to northern Idaho. Villard reached an agreement with Northern Pacific in 1880, which gave Portland access to transcontinental rail lines. Since activity in the Pacific Northwest had picked up by 1881, Union Pacific was again interested in the 1879 proposal. Union Pacific created the Oregon Short Line from Granger, Wyoming to the OR&N; lines at Huntington, Oregon, joined on November 11, 1884. Union Pacific and Northern Pacific were now in direct competition, which led Northern Pacific to build their own line directly to the coast at Tacoma, Washington. Villard's OR&N; lines were leased to Union Pacific's Oregon Short Line from 1887 until Union Pacific purchased OR&N; in 1889. Planned or incomplete railroad lines The following railroad lines were surveyed and perhaps graded, but not completed. Northeast Oregon * Union, Cornucopia and Eastern Railway (or UCE) - planned to connect Union, Oregon with mines near Cornucopia, $3 million in funds * Union, Cove and Valley Railway - planned to use the Union depot of the UCE to Cove * Union, Cornucopia and Eastern Transportation Company - planned to build on the same route of the planned UCE. November, 1898, $3.5 million in funds, had a Chinese-American director, unusual in the 1890s. * Summerville, Blue Mountain and Walla Walla Railroad Company - planned to follow the former Thomas and Ruckle Road from Summerville to Walla Walla. Fall 1898. * Union Railroad and Transportation Company, renamed Union Railroad Company. Planned to follow the UCE to the Snake River. * Hilgard, Granite and Southwestern - originate on the OR&N; line near Hilgard and connect to Granite to supply the Powder River Mines. * Grande Ronde and Wallowa Railway Company - follow the Grande Ronde River to connect Elgin, Wallowa, and Joseph. * Oregon Washington Railroad Company - G. W. Hunt, January 1889 intended to run from Weston across the Blue Mountains, eventually to Boise. Company purchased by 1891, never completed in part due to the Panic of 1893. * Wallowa Valley Railroad Company, W. J. Cook, 1905 attempt to connect Elgin to Lewiston, Idaho. OR&N; completed their line as far as Elgin once they discovered this attempt, but never completed the Lewiston segment. Completed railroad lines * Central Railway of Oregon - purchased existing rail lines near Union, Oregon and built an extension from Union to Cove in 1906. Went bankrupt in 1909, reformed as Central Railroad of Oregon in the same year. Surveyed lines across the Blue Mountains in 1910, actually built a line from Richmond to a Hot Lake Hotel. Hauled 33,415 passengers and 18,200 tons of freight in 1912, but went out of business in 1924. All rail lines were scrapped, except for the Union-Union Junction segment, which was taken over by the Union Railroad of Oregon, which was in service (especially for the Ronde Valley Lumber Company) at least into the 1970s.

Considerable turbulence was experienced between Knoxville and Birmingham due to active thunderstorms throughout the South. The flight, which was scheduled to arrive at 12:52 a.m. Central Time,Official Launch Inquiry In Crash Here Killing Two; The Birmingham News, January 7, 1946. was cleared for a straight-in approach from the north by the Birmingham tower at 3:48 a.m.. At 3:51 a.m., Flight 105 notified the tower it was performing a normal arrival pattern landing rather than a straight-in approach. The last radio contact from the plane was received at 3:54 a.m. Tower personnel observed the flight approach Runway 18 from the north in a shallow descent that visibly steepened near the approach end of the runway. The flight continued airborne just above the runway until the intersection of Runway 18 with the east‚Äìwest runway (now removed) where it touched down with only 1,500 feet (457 m) of runway remaining. As it became obvious that the flight was going to continue off the runway, tower personnel notified rescuers who immediately responded to Runway 18. After turning off the runway to the left and attempting a ground loop, the aircraft continued into Village Creek. The right wheel dropped off the 12-foot (3.7-m)-high bank first, allowing the right wing to strike rocks on the bank. The DC-3 then spun to the right and struck the south bank of the 35-foot (10.7-m)-wide creek. Village Creek was swollen from the rain which had plagued the Southern United States in the days of and before the accident, with widespread flooding and deaths due to tornadoes in neighboring Mississippi the day of the accident.Rain-Drenched City Groan At Forecast Of More Dampness; The Birmingham News, January 7, 1946. The plane came to rest nose-down with the passenger area suspended over the waters of the creek. Though the cockpit was crushed, the passenger cabin was largely undamaged and no fire resulted. Rescue personnel alerted by the tower immediately worked to evacuate passengers and rescue the three critically injured pilots in the cockpit. Most of the passengers were from various cities in central Alabama, with one passenger each from New Orleans, Louisiana; Biloxi, Mississippi; Atlanta, Georgia; and Brentwood, Pennsylvania. Media An article, photograph of the wrecked airplane, and photograph of flight attendant Miss Betty Proctor appeared at the top of the front page of the Birmingham News the day after the crash. The photo depicts the DC-3 nose down in Village Creek with extensive damage to the right wing. Significant media attention was given to an altercation between two photographers from the Birmingham News and three PCA employees who threatened the newspapermen in an attempt to prevent photographs from being taken of the crash scene. The newspaper criticized the Birmingham Police Department for not intervening and protecting the newspapermen during their efforts to report on the crash. PCA officials expressed regret over the incident and the Commissioner of Public Safety announced an investigation would be conducted into the officers‚Äô conduct. One PCA mechanic was later arrested.Police Decline Newsmen Aid in Airport Row; The Birmingham News, January 7, 1946. Investigation One official from PCA and two from the Civil Aeronautics Board office in Atlanta responded to the site to investigate the accident the same day as the crash. The CAB held public hearings in Birmingham on January 15 and 16, 1946. CAB findings On June 17, 1946, the Civil Aeronautics Board found the probable cause to be \\"the action of the pilot in committing himself to a landing from an approach which was too high and too fast.\\" The CAB held public hearings in Birmingham on January 15 and 16, 1946. Finding arrived at by the CAB focused on the poor weather that the flight experienced over a long duration, marginal weather conditions at the time of landing in Birmingham, and the possibility of mental and physical fatigue due to the late evening/early morning time of the flight, continued adverse weather, and long length of the flight. Victims The pilot, first officer, and a check airman who occupied the cockpit jump seat perished in the crash; several passengers were injured, none fatally. The first officer and check airman died the evening of the crash at Norwood Hospital in Birmingham; the captain shortly after. One passenger was paralyzed by his injuries. The flight attendant was hospitalized for shock and a possible chest injury but was widely praised for ensuring everyone was buckled just prior to landing and her efforts to administer first aid after the crash.

Near the end it began to change from a gift economy to an early form of trade called reciprocity, and introduced the apparent use of barter tokens, an early form of money. The Neolithic world Members of the Cucuteni- Trypillia culture shared common features with other Neolithic societies, including: *An almost nonexistent social stratification *Lack of a political elite *No occupational specialization *Rudimentary economy, most likely a subsistence or gift economy *Pastoralists and subsistence farmers Societies from the earlier Mesolithic period were composed of hunter gatherer tribes that also had no social stratification. Later societies of the Bronze Age had noticeable social stratification, developed occupational specialization, the sovereign state, social classes of individuals who were of the elite ruling or religious classes, full-time warriors, and wealthy merchants. Bronze Age societies also had individuals on the other end of the economic spectrum, who were poor, enslaved, and hungry. In between these two economic models (the hunter gatherer tribes and Bronze Age civilizations) we find the later Neolithic and Eneolithic societies such as the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, where the first indications of social stratification begin to be found. However, it would be a mistake to overemphasize the impact of social stratification in the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, since it was still (even in its later phases) very much an egalitarian society. Social stratification was just one of the many aspects of what is regarded as a fully established civilized society, which began with the Bronze Age. Subsistence economy Like other Neolithic societies, the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture had very little division of labor, other than the ubiquitous dualistic division based upon a person's gender. Although this culture's settlements sometimes grew to become some of the largest on earth at the time (up to 15,000 people), there is no evidence yet discovered of large-scale labor specialization. Their settlements were designed with the houses connecting with one another in long rows that circled around the center of the community. Some settlements did have a central communal building that was designated as a sanctuary or shrine, but there is no indication yet whether or not a separate group or individual would have been supported by the community as a full-time priest or priestess. Almost every home was a self-supporting unit, much as if isolated in the middle of the woods, rather than part of a large settlement. Most homes had their own ceramic kilns, baking ovens, and work centers, indicating that almost all of the work that needed to be done to maintain human existence at the Neolithic standard of living could be done within each household in the community. Reconstruction of a typical Cucuteni-Trypillia house, in the Cucuteni Museum, Piatra Neam»õ, Romania. Notice the many varied work stations within the home. Every household probably had members of the extended family who would work in the fields to raise crops, tend livestock, go to the woods to hunt game and bring back firewood, work by the river to bring back clay or fish, and all of the other duties that would be needed to survive. Contrary to popular belief, the Neolithic people experienced considerable abundance of food and other resources. This lack of competition for limited resources was probably one of the reasons that the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture (as with most of the other European Neolithic cultures) had no evidence of war throughout their entire existence. If the population of a community became too large, and began to outstrip the ability of the surrounding environment to support the inhabitants' needs, there were still vast, unexploited territories around them that a break-off group could easily travel to and start a new settlement without fear of encroaching on some other group's territorial lands. These settlements did indeed grow and divide; during its existence the Cucuteni- Trypillia culture's geographical region expanded immensely as the population increased and new communities were established. Since every household was almost entirely self-sufficient, there was very little need for trade. Goods and services were exchanged, but a household's survival did not depend on it. In the course of bringing in various resources, it was natural that a given household would reap a windfall of a particular resource, be it a large harvest of apricots, wheat, or a large bison that was brought back by the hunters, etc. When a household found itself with a plentiful supply of a particular resource, it did not necessarily mean that the surplus would be traded in the modern sense of the word, but rather, the surplus would probably be given away to others in the community who could use whatever resource they had on hand, with no thought of reciprocation or direct realized return on the part of the gifters. This is the basis of a gift economy, which has been observed in many hunter-gatherer or subsistence farmer cultures, and that was most likely the same with the Cucuteni-Trypillia society, at least during the early period of the culture. Primitive trade network Cucuteni-Trypillia shell artefact, one of the few commodities that were extensively traded in their society Although trade was not likely necessary, archaeological evidence supports the theory that long-distance trade in fact did occur. One of the clearest signs of long-distance trade is the presence of imported flint tools found at Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements. In the case of the settlement at T√¢rgu Frumos, over 7% of the chipped stone artifacts were made of a type of flint found only in the Dobruja region over 300 km to the south. In addition, another type of flint (Miorcani type) found only within cultural territory of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture has been found at archaeological sites of other Neolithic cultures to the west in Transylvania and the Pannonian Plains. A sample of Miorcani flint from the Cenomanian chalky marl layer of the Moldavian Plateau (approximately 7.5 cm wide) There were also certain rare mineral resources that, because of limitations due to distance and prevalence, were also moved along these rudimentary trade networks that towards the end of the culture would begin to become more and more important to the survival of the members of this society. The most important of these minerals was salt, which is critical for human existence. Indeed, the Cucuteni-Trypillia saltworks located at the brackish spring at Lunca, Neam≈£ County, Romania, may very well be the oldest in the world.Romania Olivier Weller & Gheorghe Dumitroaia The earliest salt production in the world: an early Neolithic exploitation in Poiana Slatinei-Lunca , Antiquity, Vol. 79 No. 306, December 2005 There is evidence to indicate that the production of this valuable commodity directly contributed to the rapid growth of the society.Arch√¶Dyn ‚Äì Dijon Dynamics settlement pattern, production and trades from Neolithic to Middle Ages, 23‚Äì25 June 2008 This saltworks was so productive that it supplied the needs of the entire region. For this to happen, the salt had to be transported, which may have marked the beginning of a trade network that developed into a more complex system over time.Valeriu Cavruc, Gheorghe Dumitroaia Vestigii arheologice privind exploatarea s√£rii pe teritoriul Rom√¢niei √Æn perioada neo-eneolitic√£ Other mineral resources that were traded included iron magnetite ore and manganese Jacobsite ore, which came into play later in the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture's development. These minerals were used to create the black pigment that decorated the beautiful ceramic pottery of this culture, and came from two sources: 1) Iacobeni, Suceava County, Romania for the iron magnetite ore, and 2) Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Ukraine for the manganese Jacobsite ore, located in the farthest eastern periphery of the Cucuteni-Trypillia geographical region, along the Dnieper River.B. Constantinescu, R. Bugoi, E. Pantos, D. Popovici Phase and chemical composition analysis of pigments used in Cucuteni Neolithic painted ceramics , Documenta Praehistorica XXXIV (2007) However, no traces of the manganese Jacobsite ore have been found in pigments used on artifacts from the western settlements on the opposite end of the region. This indicates that, although there was a trade network established, it was still rudimentary.Investigation of Neolithic ceramic pigments using synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction Roxana Bugoi and Bogdan Constantinescu ‚ÄúHoria Hulubei‚Äù National Institute of Nuclear Physics and Engineering, 077125 Bucharest, Romania Emmanuel Pantos CCLRC, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington WA4 4AD, United Kingdom Dragomir Popovici National Museum of Romanian History, Bucharest, Romania Interaction with other societies The Cucuteni-Trypillia people were exporting Miorcani type flint to the west even from their first appearance. The import of flint from Dobruja indicates an interaction with the Gumelni≈£a-Karanovo culture and Aldeni-Stoicani cultures to the south. Toward the end of the Cucuteni- Trypillia culture's existence (from roughly 3000 B.C. to 2750 B.C.), copper traded from other societies (mostly from the Gumelni≈£a-Karanovo culture copper mines of the northeastern Balkan) began to appear throughout the region, and members of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture began to acquire skills necessary to use it to create various items. Along with the raw copper ore, finished copper tools, hunting weapons and other artifacts were also brought in from other cultures. In exchange for the imported copper, the Cucuteni-Trypillia traders would export their finely crafted pottery and the high-quality flint that was to be found in their territory, which have been found in archaeological sites in distant lands. However, the Lunca salt, which was ubiquitous throughout the region, was not traded away. The introduction of copper marked the transition from the Neolithic to the Eneolithic, also known as the Chalcolithic or Copper Age. This was a transitional period, as it was of a relatively short duration lasting less than 300 years before being replaced by the Bronze Age that was probably introduced by Proto-Indo-European tribes that came into this region from the east. The end of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture coincided with the arrival of the Bronze Age. There is much controversy surrounding how the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture ended, which is discussed in greater detail in the article Decline and end of the Cucuteni‚ÄìTrypillia culture. Bronze artifacts began to show up in archaeological sites toward the very end of the culture. Beginning as early as 4500 B.C., the Yamna culture, a Proto-Indo-European group from the Pontic steppe north of the Black Sea, began to establish nomadic camps and temporary settlements throughout the region settled by the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture. These Proto-Indo-Europeans were nomadic pastoralists, who rode domesticated horses, and ranged over a wide region stretching from the Balkans to Kazakhstan. They had superior technologies in horse domestication, metalworking, and a much more developed trade network compared to the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, however the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture had a higher level of technology in regards to agriculture, salt- processing, and ceramics. The Proto-Indo-Europeans acquired technologies to work copper and then bronze much earlier than the Cucuteni-Trypillias, who never quite managed to develop bronze artifacts. The Proto-Indo-Europeans traded their copper and bronze tools and jewelry with the Cucuteni-Trypillias for their elaborately designed and finely crafted pottery. As these cultures interacted with each other over a period of nearly 2000 years, there is little evidence of open warfare, although there is speculation that the huge Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements grew as large as they did during their later phase of their culture as a result of providing a stronger defense against any potential raiding conducted by nomadic Proto-Indo-European groups that might have been wandering through their neighborhood. Still, remarkably, almost no actual weapons have been found in any Cucuteni-Trypillia sites, neither have there been skeletal remains discovered that would indicate the person had died violently (arrowheads lodged in the bones, crushed skulls, etc.). Irish- American scholar J. P. Mallory wrote in his 1989 book In search of the Indo- Europeans: > Ethnographic evidence suggests a very fluid boundary between mobile and > settled communities, and it is entirely probable that some pastoralists may > have settled permanently whilst Tripoleans may have become integrated into > the more mobile steppe communities.

The final blow may have come when the favorable agricultural conditions during the Holocene climatic optimum, which lasted from 7000 to 3200 B.C., quite suddenly changed, resulting in the arid Sub-Boreal phase, which created the worst and longest drought in Europe since the end of the last Ice Age. The large Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements, which relied entirely on subsistence agriculture for support, would have faced very nasty Dust Bowl conditions, making it impossible to continue their way of life. It is theorized that the combination of this drought and the existence of neighboring nomadic pastoralist tribes led to the complete collapse of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, and the abandonment of their settlements, as members of the culture left behind the plow to take up the saddle of a nomad, as pastoralists are better equipped to eke out a living in an arid environment. The results were that by 2750 B.C. the Proto-Indo-European culture completely dominated the area. The primitive trade network of the Cucuteni-Trypillia society that had been slowly growing more complex was thus abruptly ended, along with the culture that supported it. Or, rather, it was supplanted by another more advanced trade network as the Proto-Indo-Europeans moved in to take the land, and to bring with them an entirely new society with division of labor, a ruling and religious elite, social stratification, and, in a word, civilization.Cucutenian Communities in the Bahlui Basin File:Tripolye pots.jpgBronze artifacts from later Cucuteni-Trypillian period File:CucuteniBattleAxes.JPGFew copper artifacts have been found, many copper tools were imported from the Balkans.

That's just the way it is, and I'm completely laidback with that. I got to experience the rockstar existence so much in 1987 and especially in 1989 and a little bit into 1992, so that dream has been realized. If I'm not upfront, that's totally cool, because I know I've been a part of all this.\\" He played his last concert with TNT in Ume√•, Sweden on 5 March 2011.

Pinaud perfume house and cosmetics company in 1830. Leaving home at age 13 for Cologne, Pinaud sought to become an apprentice in perfumery. In 1830, he bought ‚ÄúA la Corbeille Fleurie‚Äù, a store located at 230 rue Saint Martin in Paris. In 1852, he partnered with his friend, Emile Meyer, to found La Villette (a perfume factory) and opened four stores in the city. On 18 August 1855, Queen Victoria went to Paris to attend the Universal Exposition that year. Pinaud wanted to attract her attention, and as such, created a perfume named after her: ‚ÄúBouquet de la Reine Victoria‚Äù. As a result of this, Pinaud would become the official supplier to Queen Victoria, as well as Emperor Napoleon III. Following Pinaud's death in 1868, Meyer took over management of the company, and in 1883 the company was handed to Meyer's son- in-law, Victor Klotz. Klotz would maintain control of the company until the Great Depression in the early 1930s. The company today manufactures men's grooming products under the Clubman-Pinaud brand.

The county existed from the late ninth century to the middle of the tenth. The name of the county survives in that of the comune of Valloriate. The earliest known count was one Rodulf, who died in 902, leaving the county to a Frank named Roger, who had been his second-in- command. Between 940 and 945 Roger's son and successor, Arduin Glaber, drove the Saracens from the Val di Susa and annexed that region to his county of Auriate. Arduin was a supporter of Berengar of Ivrea in his successful bid for the Iron Crown of Lombardy in 950. The following year (951) Berengar completed a reorganisation of western Lombardy, creating three new marches to better defend the coast from Saracen attacks: the March of Genoa (Eastern Liguria), the March of Montferrat (Western Liguria), and the March of Turin. Arduin was created the first Margrave of Turin. At this time Auriate disappears from the records as a distinct entity, but it remained the centre of the property of the Arduinici family three generations later, when Bertha married Ottone del Vasto of the Aleramici clan. Their joint properties formed the nucleus of the later March of Saluzzo.  References  * M. G. Bertolini. \\"Arduino.\\" Dizionario biografico degli Italiani, VI:49‚Äì52.

In 2007, he won the Civil Courage Prize for his work on behalf of North Korean refugees. Early life Buck was born in Hwang Hae Nam Do, Ong Jin Goon, present-day North Korea in 1941. He was separated from his family during the Korean War and fled to South Korea in the 1950s. He later attended Han Sae University, receiving a Bachelor's and Master's in theology. In 1982, he immigrated to Seattle, Washington in the US, and became a naturalized US citizen in 1989. Mission work Buck began his mission work with Assemblies of God Korean District in January 1992 in Khabarovsk and Vladivostok, Russia, establishing churches in both cities. In 1994, he began to evangelize in China, working there for the next twelve years. In 1997, he expanded his ministry to North Korea as well, founding a noodle factory at Sun Bong Goon during the North Korean famine. Raising money in the US, he established a network of shelters for North Korean refugees within China, compared by Time magazine to the US Underground Railroad. In 2002, he avoided arrest by chance after an informant gained entry to one of his safe houses, leading to a police raid; Buck happened to be out of the country. He then gave up his birth name and legally changed his name to Phillip Buck so that he could return undetected. By 2012, Buck had helped more than 200 North Korean refugees escape and resettle in South Korea. Arrest On May 9, 2005, Buck was arrested in Yanji by Chinese authorities while escorting a group of 14 North Korean refugees. He was imprisoned for 15 months before being released through the intervention of the US Embassy, but was banned from returning to China. Columnists for The New York Times described the arrest as a sign of \\"a gradually hardening Chinese posture\\" toward the growing number of North Korean refugees. Though his children asked him to stop his work given his increasing age‚ÄîBuck was 65 at the time of his release‚ÄîBuck stated that he intended to continue. Recognition In 2007, Buck was awarded the Civil Courage Prize of the Train Foundation, which recognizes \\"steadfast resistance to evil at great personal risk ‚Äî rather than military valor\\". The prize came with a cash award of $50,000.

Background In 1861, states located in the southern region of the United States, withdrew from the union after the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln, out of fear that he would hurt the institution of slavery. These southern states formed the Confederate States of America. Many prominent speakers from both the North and Middle States expressed a desire to allow the southern states to secede peacefully. In the middle states, there also existed a sentiment to actually join the Southern Confederacy. Former Congressman John Pendleton Kennedy and Governor Thomas Hicks, both of Maryland, called for a Central Confederacy composed of the states of Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, North Carolina, and Maryland.. The plan Kennedy published a pamphlet entitled The Border States on December 15, 1860, that suggested the secession and confederation of the Border States of Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, North Carolina, and Maryland..

It was the sixth event under the Lockdown chronology and the fourth event of the 2010 TNA PPV schedule. In the tradition of Lockdown events, every match took place inside a steel cage. It was the first Lockdown event with a four-sided steel cage. In October 2017, with the launch of the Global Wrestling Network, the event became available to stream on demand. Production=Background The sixth installment to the Lockdown PPV chronology was first announced in a press release on January 16, 2010 regarding the February Against All Odds PPV event. The date and area of the event was not announced until February 4, 2010, when another press release proclaimed that it would take place on April 18, 2010 at the Family Arena in Saint Charles, Missouri. A tradition of the series is that all encounters take place inside a steel cage which will be continued. On January 17, 2010 at their Genesis PPV event, TNA discontinued the usage of their normal six sided ring, with a four sided ring being chosen instead. It was the first Lockdown to feature the traditional four-sided cage. Storylines Lockdown featured nine professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The headline match for the Lockdown event featured the TNA World Heavyweight Champion A.J. Styles defending his title against D'Angelo Dinero, who, at Against All Odds, won the opportunity to challenge for the title. At the beginning of the show it was announced that X Division Champion Douglas Williams was unable to get to St Louis due to the massive flight cancellations worldwide and was therefore stripped of the title. The Motor City Machine Guns' match with Brian Kendrick and Homicide was changed to a four-man Xscape match, in which the winner would replace Williams in the X Division Title Match. Homicide was victorious, but was unable to capture the gold. It was also announced that Syxx-Pac had no-showed the event and would not compete in his scheduled match teaming with Scott Hall to take on Team 3D. Later in the night it was announced that Hall needed to find a partner, or go into a handicap match against Team 3D. At the conclusion of Kevin Nash's match he announced he would replace Syxx-Pac as Hall's tag partner. Aftermath The night after Lockdown, Rob Van Dam defeated AJ Styles to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. A rematch would take place at Sacrifice, with Van Dam defeating Styles to retain the title. After turning heel at Lockdown, Tara teamed up with the babyface duo of Sarita and Taylor Wilde in a losing effort against The Beautiful People in a match for all of the Knockouts championships. Tara later challenged Madison Rayne to a Title vs Career match at Sacrifice, which Rayne won to retain the title and end Tara's career. However, Tara would return at Victory Road and continue her status as a villainess by aligning with Rayne.

Reasons for opposition The opposition was initiated by media activists already active in high key campaigns such as the struggle for the preservation of the Star Ferry Pier in Edinburgh Place in 2006 and Queen's Pier in 2007, at the outset, only focused on saving Choi Yuen Tsuen village, which was painstakingly built by its residents over four decades. Yet, while the activists were working on ways to solve the problem, they found out the many inconsistencies with the government plan and finally went out to oppose the rail link as a whole. It was widely regarded as sacrificing the interests of the common people to a small minority of economic elites. Besides possible damage to the environment during its construction and operation, the rail link would cost HK$69.9 billion (US$9 billion), while the estimated return over 50 years is only HK$80b. A village along the track, Choi Yuen Tsuen, home to about 500 people, would be dismantled. Tai Kok Tsui residents said the railway would cause unbearable noise pollution to residents in some districts and could cause a number of old buildings with poor foundations to collapse.New front opens in fight against hi-speed rail link , The Standard (4 January 2010) A number of different groups, ranging from environmentalists to the affected villagers, oppose the project for different reasons.

Cultural critic Law Wing-sang regards the opposition to the Guangzhou-Hong Kong Express Rail Link as the first step of the collapse of the dominant ideology and analyses the movement as having initiated the process of decolonisation for Hong Kong, where local economic elites and colonizers have historically worked hand in hand with each other, in what he termed collaborative colonial power.Kwong wing-yuen (ed.), Zhan zai dan de yi bian, Xianggang bashihou, Hong Kong, UP Publications Limited, 2010, pp. 16‚Äì32.Law Wing-seng, Collaborative colonial power, The Making of the Hong Kong Chinese, Hong Kong University Press, 2009 Ma Ngok, another prominent political observer, also supported the protesters, and regarded the \\"black box\\" process through which the project of the Rail Link was arrived at as epitomising the structural governance problem of the Hong Kong administration.

Florida was two United States Supreme Court cases dealing with the imposition of the death penalty. In the first case, 454 U.S. 1037 (1981),. the Supreme Court, with two dissents, refused Spaziano's petition for certiorari. However, the Florida Supreme Court would reverse Spaziano's death sentence based on the judge's receipt of a confidential report which was not received by either party. On remand, the judge reimposed the death penalty and the Florida Supreme Court upheld the sentence. In the second case, 468 U.S. 447 (1984),. the Court heard Spaziano's appeal of his death sentence. Facts Spaziano was tried for first-degree murder, but the court refused to offer lesser non-capital offenses as the statute of limitations had expired on them when Spaziano refused to waive the statute of limitations. The jury convicted Spaziano and recommended a sentence of life imprisonment. Florida law makes the jury's recommendation merely that, a recommendation, and requires the judge to examine the aggravating and mitigating factors and thus gives the judge the power to override the jury and impose the death penalty. Issues 1\\\\. Was the judge in error for not advising the jury that it could consider lesser non-capital offenses? 2. Is a jury's determination not to impose capital punishment final? 3. If a judge is imposing a death sentence after a jury imposition of life imprisonment, does this violate the double-jeopardy clause? 4. Is a judge imposition of death over-riding a jury decision of life imprisonment violating the constitutional requirement for reliability of capital sentencing? Result Since the non-capital offenses were not lesser- included offenses of the crime to which Spaziano was charged, it was not error for the court to refuse to offer them to the jury (in the absence of Spaziano waiving the statute of limitations). Florida law giving the trial court the power to over-ride a jury recommendation of life and impose the death penalty is not unconstitutional, in that there is nothing irrational or arbitrary about this method. Spaziano's death sentence was upheld. Dissents White and Rehnquist concurred in general, and dissented in part on the majority holding that a state must allow the defendant to waive the statute of limitations where there is the possibility of a lesser charge. Stevens, Brennan and Marshall concurred in the majority opinion and dissented in part, holding that they felt that imposition of the death penalty against the wishes of the jury violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Other The Spaziano ruling was vitiated by the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in another death penalty case, Hurst v. Florida (2016)..

A small shrub to 1 m (3 ft) high with pinnate leaves and pink to white flowers, it is found in eucalypt woodland. Description Boronia imlayensis grows as a small shrub to 1 m (3 ft) high. It has hairy, warty stems, and pinnate leaves, which are made up of seven to eleven smaller leaflets, each one lozenge-shaped and measuring 3.5 to 16 mm in length and 1‚Äì4 mm wide. Flowering occurs in late spring and early summer (September to December). The inflorescences are made up of three to nine small flowers which range in colour from white to a dark pink. Each flower has four petals which range from 5 to 7.5 mm in length. Taxonomy Boronia imlayensis was first formally described in 2003 by botanist Marco Duretto in the journal Muelleria from specimens he collected on a Mt Imlay ridgetop in 1995. Its specific name refers to the place where it is found, Mount Imlay. Within the genus Boronia, this species is placed in the type series Boronia which contains well known species such as Boronia megastigma. Within this, it belongs to a group of 25 species of pinnate-leaved boronias from southeastern Australia, many of which have restricted ranges. Its relatives include B. citriodora, B. gunnii, B. latipinna, B. muelleri, B. pinnata, B. rivularis, B. safrolifera and B. thujona. Distribution and habitat The species is found only in eucalypt woodland on a ridge atop Mount Imlay in Mount Imlay National Park near Eden in far southern New South Wales. As of April 2010 there is no official status for this rare plant, despite it being found only at Mount Imlay in an area which is only 500 metres long by about 50 metres wide. Cultivation The species is unknown in cultivation. Boronias in general are sensitive to dieback and tend to be short-lived.

Conversion of the building The conversion of the building for the Museo Picasso was a major undertaking, led by the American architect Richard Gluckman,Presentaci√≥n del libro Arquitectura del Museo Picasso M√°laga.

Article begins on p. 31, link is to p. 33, which has the relevant passage. Gluckman was something of a known quantity in M√°laga, having previously successfully remodeled the city's Episcopal Palace as an exhibition space. The project was budgeted at over 2,000 million pesetas, about US$20 million. The start of the project was delayed three months to get permission from the city for the existing buildings that would be demolished. Gluckman originally considered a simple rehabilitation of the palace, but soon decided on a different course.Pablo Ferrand, Cultura no puede edificar en el jard√≠n para ampliar el Museo de Bellas Artes, ABC Valencia, 2003-12-21. Accessed online 2010-01-17. The article is mainly about a proposed enlargement of the Museo de Bellas Artes in Seville. The original of the quoted phrase from Mar√≠a Salinas Ruiz is \\"sus maravillosos espacios, su suelo, sus recovecos y sus fuentes\\". The palace itself would not be big enough for the contemplated museum, and they went about acquiring adjacent buildings and land, and getting permission to incorporate or destroy various existing buildings. An initial plan was presented in July 1998; it was later expanded to include more space for a library/documentation center, an auditorium, and an educational department. The result was a decision to incorporate and refurbish several nearby historic buildings that were in disrepair. The ultimate design placed the modern buildings for offices and the new auditorium in and among a set of restored 18th and 19th century buildings.Isabel C√°mara Guezala and Rafael Mart√≠n Delgado, El encuentro del pasado y el futuro, Diario Sur Digital. Part of the Canal Picasso series. Accessed online 2010-01-18. The excavations for the work led to remarkable discoveries: remnants of a city wall and towers dating back to the Phoenicians, of a Roman factory to produce the fish-based sauce garum, and also of the earlier Nasrid palace on the same site. As a result, the basement is effectively an archeological museum in its own right,Simon Baskett, John Fisher, The rough guide to Spain, Rough Guides, 2004. . p. 464-465. visible from above through transparent panels in the floor.Museo Picasso - M√°laga, Diario Sur Digital. Part of the Canal Picasso series. Accessed online 2010-01-18.Taujel, official site. Many of the most difficult aspects of the conversion are precisely the ones that cannot be seen by the casual visitor. A purpose-built museum can take considerations of temperature, humidity, and cleanliness of air into account from the start of the design. When working with a 450-year-old palace, matters are not so simple, and are even more complex when one is resolved to change the ambience of the rooms‚Äîespecially the exhibition halls‚Äîas little as possible. In particular ductwork must be well hidden, but running through the walls is also a very complicated matter, because one must not weaken the building's structure. This problem was solved in part through making air conditioning vents out of white marble slabs with pseudo-Mud√©jar design elements, integrated into the walls. Similar techniques were applied to lighting considerations: modern technology in ancient disguise. In This approach of mixing the modern and the historical was put particularly to the test in March 2002, when a fire broke out, damaging three of the halls destined to be exhibition spaces. The damaged 16th century coffered ceilings were recreated by the Madrid-based Taujel company, combining traditional craftsmanship with computer design techniques. Gluckman's firm received a 2005 Design Award from the American Institute of Architects for the project.The Architect Richard Gluckman Wins an Award from the American Institute of Architects for his design of the Museo Picasso M√°laga , Museo Picasso M√°laga, Press release 2005-10-18. Accessed online 2010-01-18. Still, historian Mar√≠a Salinas Ruiz of M√°laga was not at all pleased by the undertaking, criticizing the sacrifice of two houses with listed historical status and the major modifications to the palace itself, destroying \\"its marvelous spaces, its flooring, its winding passages and its fountains\\" that took such advantage of the light at different times of day. Others have spoken of how well the resulting galleries display Picasso's work. Picasso and the Calle San Agust√≠n The Museo Picasso M√°laga is only from the Plaza de La Merced, where Picasso was born, and is located in the Calle San Agust√≠n, to which Picasso and his family had no small connection. Although he moved away from M√°laga at the age of 10, Picasso went to nursery school on that street, and his father Jos√© Ruiz Picasso was curator of the city museum in the old town hall, also on that street. That museum had an excellent collection of the city's main artists, but for budgetary reasons was seldom open to the public. Because of the same budgetary issues, part of the elder Picasso's compensation was space for his own painting studio, where the younger Picasso did some of his first artwork.Places in Malaga associated with Picasso , Fundaci√≥n Picasso.

He was the son of Tormod. Malcolm and his kinsman Torquil are the first MacLeod chiefs to appear in contemporary records. Clan tradition states he was the greatest hero of the clan and links him to the origin of the clan relic known as Sir Rory Mor's Horn. He is said to have become extremely overweight in his old age and was known as 'Good Fat Malcolm' or 'Malcolm the thick-legged'. According to tradition he was buried at Iona. Malcolm's son, Iain Ciar MacLeod, succeeded him as chief of the clan. Life Malcolm has traditionally been said to have been the son of Tormod, second chief of Clan MacLeod. The traditional view was that Tormod was a grandson of Leod, founder of the clan; that Tormod's father, also named Tormod, died before Leod, and thus when Leod died the chiefship skipped his generation. The current view is that the 'middle' Tormod did not exist and that Malcolm was the son of Tormod, and thus the grandson of Leod. According to early 20th-century clan historian R.C. MacLeod, Malcolm was born in 1296 and succeeded his father in the year 1320. Malcolm and his kinsman Torquil are the first MacLeod chiefs to appear in contemporary records. Their names are recorded as \\"Malcolme, son to Tormode M'Cloyde\\", and that of \\"Torkyll M'Cloyd\\", in a royal charter dating to about 1343, during the reign of David II (r. 1329-1371). The Bannatyne manuscript is the main authority for information on the early chiefs of Clan MacLeod. This traditional account of the clan is thought to date to about the 1830s. The document describes Malcolm as the greatest hero of all MacLeods and states that he married a daughter of Sir Neil Campbell of Lochow, ancestor of the Dukes of Argyll. According to 19th-century historian A. Mackenzie, Malcolm married Martha, daughter of the Earl of Mar. R.C. MacLeod speculated that this earl was \\"the seventh\\" and considered it not impossible that Malcolm could have married both women. MacLeod noted that both marriages would have had close links to the family of Robert the Bruce; both Sir Neil, and Lord Mar, had married sisters of Bruce (Mary Bruce and Christina Bruce). According to one tradition, Sir Rory Mor's Horn, originated with Malcolm's victorious encounter with the terrorising bull from Glenelg. According to clan tradition, Malcolm was both brave and strong. The manuscript tells a tale of how Malcolm returned from a tryst with the Campbell wife of the chief of the Frasers who possessed part of the lands of Glenelg. That night Malcolm encountered a bull which lived in the woods of Glenelg and which had terrorised the local inhabitants. Armed with only a dirk, Malcolm slew the bull and broke off one of its horns. He then carried off the horn to Dunvegan as a trophy of his prowess. For this act of valour, Fraser's wife forsook her husband for Malcolm; thus starting a lengthy clan feud between the Frasers and the MacLeods. The tradition runs that ever since the horn has remained at Dunvegan and that it had since been converted into a drinking horn, which each chief must drain to the bottom in one draught. The manuscript continues that ever since Malcolm defeated the bull, the family of MacLeod of MacLeod have used a bull's head as their heraldic crest, with the motto \\"hold fast\\". Today the crest of the MacLeods of MacLeod contains a bull and the clan possesses a drinking horn, known as Sir Rory Mor's Horn (pictured left), which is said to be the horn of clan tradition--it is located in Dunvegan Castle with other heirlooms. The manuscript states that in his old age, Malcolm became extremely overweight, and for this he was known as \\"Callum Reamhar Math\\" (Good Fat Malcolm). It also noted the within the 1767 memorial, he is known as \\"Malcolm Coise Reamhar\\" (\\"the thick-legged\\"). It states that he died in the castle of Stornoway while visiting his kinsman, MacLeod of Lewis; and that he was laid to rest on the isle of Iona, beside his father. Issue The Bannatyne manuscript states that Malcolm had four sons--John, his heir; Tormod; Murdo; and Malcolm Og. Tormod, the second son, lived on Bernera, Harris. His descendants lived there until the time of Sir Rory Mor; the writer of the manuscript also notes that at the top of writing, Tormod's descendants lived on Pabbay and called themselves \\"Clan Vic Gillecallam cas Reamhar Vic Leod\\". Malcolm's third son, Murdo, was left the lands of Glenelg; his descendants held onto these lands for several generations and were known as the MacLeods of Gesto. The head of the Gesto branch was always called \\"Mac Vic Tormod\\". The fourth son of Malcolm, Malcolm Og, married a daughter of MacDuffie of Colonsay and settled in Argyll. The manuscript states that general belief amongst MacCallums was that Malcolm Og was their founding ancestor. However, the writer of the manuscript notes another possible origin for the MacCallums, which he had learned from another source. The manuscript states that Malcolm fathered six illegitimate sons with his Campbell lover (who had left her Fraser husband). These children then lived in their mother's native Argyll and considered themselves a sept of the Campbells. The writer of the manuscript states that according to his source, the oldest senachies of the MacCallums traced their descent from these illegitimate sons of Malcolm.

The older fountain, by Maderno, is on the north side of the square. Pope Innocent VIII fountain The Maderno fountain on the north side of the square is located on the site of an earlier fountain, built in 1490 during the time of Pope Innocent VIII. It was reputed to be the finest fountain in Rome, with two vasques and three jets of water coming from the mouths of three stone heads, and three coats of arms of Pope Innocent VIII, carved by Alonso du Capua. The fountain was described by the Roman chronicler Stefano Infessura: \\"In the year 1490, His Holiness constructed on the Square of St. Peter ... a magnificent fountain, with marble plaques inscribed with history, and two round vasques one above the other, so that they can be seen; and anyone will judge, nothing comparable can be found anywhere in Italy.\\"Cited in Mauizia Tazartes, Fontaines de Rome, p. 24. The fountain was restored by Pope Alexander VI in 1500 and a watering basin for animals was added.Maurizia Tazartes, Fontaines de Rome, p. 82. Maderno fountain Fountain of St. Peter's Square by Carlo Maderno Fountain of St. Peter's Square by Carlo Maderno (1612-1614) In 1612, the ancient Roman aqueduct the Aqua Traiana was rebuilt by Pope Paul V and renamed the Acqua Paola; the restored aqueduct provided the fountain with a much more abundant source of water. The architect Carlo Maderno, nephew of the architect Domenico Fontana, was given the commission to redesign the fountain. He built a new octagonal base for the fountain on top of which he built a large irregular basin, decorated with steps and small columns, to hold the water. He kept the large lower stone vasque of the old fountain, and ornamented the pedestal above it with four stone scrolls. He removed the smaller upper vasque, and replaced it with an inverted vasque or cap like a mushroom, covered with stone scales. When the water spouted from the top, it poured down over the top of the upper vasque, its flow broken and made to sparkle by the stone scales. In addition, he removed the coats of arms of the three previous Popes and replaced them with plaques honoring his patron, Pope Paul V. Like all fountains of the time, the fountain on St. Peter's Square had no pumps and operated purely by gravity, with a source of water higher than the fountain which caused the water to shoot upwards. The source of water for the fountain, the Aqua Paola, was on the Janiculum hill, 266 above sea level, which meant that the fountain could shoot water twenty feet upwards into the air.Katherine Wentworth Rinne, The Fall and Rise of the Waters of Rome, in Fountains - Splash and Spectacle. pg. 31. In 1641, the Flemish lawyer Theodor Ameyden said that the jet of water from the top of the fountain \\"seemed to rise in the air like a veritable river.\\" He called it \\"the most beautiful fountain which exists in Europe\\".Cited by Tazartes, Fontaines de Rome, pg. 25. Bernini fountain Fountain of St. Peter's Square by Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1667-1677) For half a century, the square was decorated with the Maderno fountain and with the obelisk raised by Pope Sixtus V, but the southern part of the square remained empty. In 1667, Pope Clement X commissioned Gian Lorenzo Bernini to build a second fountain, which closely followed the design of the Maderno fountain. The Bernini fountain was completed in 1677. Influence The Fountains of St. Peter's Square influenced other fountains throughout Europe. The Roman fountain at Peterhof in Russia (1720) was inspired by the Maderno fountain, and took its name from it.Alexandre Orloff and Dimitri Chvidkovski, Saint-Petersburg, l'architecture des tsars. Paris, Editions de Menges, 1995, p. 324. The Fontaines de la Concorde in the Place de la Concorde in Paris (1840), by Jacques-Ignace Hittorff, were also strongly influenced by the Maderno fountain and the arrangement of the fountains and obelisk in St. Peter's Square.\\"La reference a Rome, tres present au cours du siecle, est ici patent; la situation des fontaines par rapport a l'obelisque, la vasque superieure formant calotte illustrent clairement l'influence de la place Saint-Pierre de Bernin.\\" Beatrice Lamoitier, L'Essor des fontaines monumentales, in Paris et ses fontaines, de la Renaissance a nos jours, Collection Paris et son Patrimoine, Paris, 1995.

It is located at the intersection of State Highway 16 and Farm Road 1769, in the northeast corner of Young County about 21 miles from Graham. As of the 2000 Census, the population was estimated to be 50.  History  Indian ExodusMarkley cemeteryMarkley was founded in 1888 and was originally known as Plum Grove. That year, a post office named Manlee was established there with Steve Munderbeck as postmaster. Other early postmasters included: John Wellington, James McDaniel, W.W. Gregg, and Myra Connelly. By 1890, the original name given to the community, Plum Grove, was changed to Markley to honor General A. C. Markley who had settled in Young County. Markley grew slowly until oil was discovered there in the early 1900s. By the 1920s, it possessed several churches, businesses as well as its own school, and a bank. The community of Markley continues to be an oil-producing area as new wells are still being drilled today. Even before Markey was officially a town, the location was a known camping spot and was used as a layover during the Indian exodus in 1859. This event marked the end of the Indian tribes time on the Brazos reservation as they were moved to Indian territory. The Indians were accompanied by wagons, supplies, soldiers, supply agents and others. The Markley cemetery was begun in 1888 next to the old Plum Grove School. The first burial there was of M.C. Norfleet. After ten years, the burial ground was no longer being cared for, so in 1890, a group of citizens from the surrounding rural community including J. C. Calvin, J.W. Cox, R.E. Currie, S.G. Dean, Nelson Owen, M.A. Stewart, Andy and Ike Tinney, J.M. Wallace, and W.M. Watson, organized an annual \\"Graveyard Working Day\\". The working day was scheduled for the first Saturday in May. During this time, residents from the surrounding area came by wagon and horseback. After cleaning the area, the practice of placing flowers on the graves was performed. In 1925, the observation was changed to the first Sunday in May. Today, there is a cemetery association that provides care for the cemetery yet Decoration Day continues as an annual social event bringing dozens of people from far away to pay respect to those buried there. Some of the individuals honored each year include the graves of thirteen Civil War veterans: John F. Bussey, J.C. Butler, Jessie Byrd, R.E. Currie, George J. Lucas, J.D. Mankins, J.L. McDaniel, J.L. Norfleet, Nelson Owen, J.C. Stanley, James Stinnett, Cates Thompson, and David White.  Education  Markley's students are served by the Graham Independent School District.

History The Martha‚Äôs Vineyard Times was founded in the spring of 1984 by five Islanders in the midst of great population growth (45 percent between 1970 and 1980, 30 percent between 1980 and 1990, and another 30 percent between 1990 and 2000) and social and economic change in the Vineyard community personal per capita income increased more than sixfold in the same period. In the obituary for Robert ‚ÄúBob‚Äù Carroll, retired Times editor Doug Cabral said, ‚ÄúThey believed that the Vineyard needed a newspaper that would take an aggressive interest in the year-round residents and the year-round economy of the Vineyard, both of which they thought were under-represented,‚Äù and so took direct aim at the editorial convictions of the venerable and much admired weekly Vineyard Gazette, which was deeply committed to conservation and preservation of the Vineyard‚Äôs bucolic past. The challenges of publishing a comprehensive and responsible community newspaper in a competitive market proved daunting to the founders, and in 1991 they sold The Martha‚Äôs Vineyard Times to their editor Doug Cabral and his wife Molly. An early challenge was the decision to convert the Times from a paid circulation broadsheet, like the Vineyard Gazette, to a free, mailed, tabloid-size newspaper. The new competition was met with consternation and disdain from the Gazette‚Äôs leadership, but the strategy proved successful. In combination with comprehensive community readership and a broad editorial constituency, the business advantages of total market circulation and advertiser reach provided the financial support necessary to sustain a viable model for community journalism.  Staff and Organization  The Martha‚Äôs Vineyard Times employs approximately 20 full-time staff year- round, along with a number of freelance and part-time staff. Responsibility for all editorial products lies with Jamie Kageleiry, associate publisher. All print and web products are published by Martha‚Äôs Vineyard Times Corp., which is owned by Peter and Barbara Oberfest, who serve as publishers. The Oberfests became partners in The Times with Doug and Molly Cabral in 1995 and became sole owners in May 2014.

She was dismissed from the New South Wales Police Academy for failing to disclose her past. Her judicial attempts for reinstatement were ultimately unsuccessful. Early life Hollingsworth was born in 1966, the daughter of a Victorian police officer. After completing her schooling at Wodonga West High School in 1984, she moved to Sydney. After a succession of jobs including shop assistant and waitress, she turned to stripping and eventually prostitution. She sometimes performed at fundraising functions and buck's nights frequented by police officers, occasionally leading to paid sex. During her eight years as a prostitute, Hollingsworth became aware of some police extorting brothel keepers and demanding sexual favours from prostitutes. Police trainee and undercover agent In 1994 Hollingsworth applied to join the New South Wales Police Force but failed the physical agility test. She applied successfully in 1995 and was sent to the New South Wales Police Academy in Goulburn. She began well and earned positive comments in her class report. As other students became aware of her past, she was subjected to harassment and requests for sexual favours. About one month after commencing her studies, Hollingsworth was recognised as a former prostitute by a police officer studying a detectives course at the Academy. He approached her to work in a brothel that he was opening in western Sydney. Undercover agent Hollingsworth lodged a formal complaint against the detective; the matter came to the attention of the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service which was at that time investigating police corruption. In meetings with staff assisting the Commission she named a further 20 officers who frequented brothels and strip shows. Hollingsworth subsequently stated that the Royal Commission encouraged her to return to prostitution to collect information on police involvement in the vice industry. Her flat was fitted with a hidden camera and she wore a \\"wire\\" to entrap the corrupt police officer, who by then was skimming 10% of Hollingsworth's income from prostitution. Hollingsworth was subsequently sent to Adelaide for her own protection; however, it was alleged she was encouraged by police to again return to prostitution to support herself. Dismissal and fight for reinstatement On 18 July 1995 (while Hollingsworth was co- operating with the Royal Commission) Superintendent R. J. Myatt, Acting Principal at the Academy, dismissed her for omitting information about her previous employment from her application.. In 1997 Hollingsworth appealed her dismissal to the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales (IRC). Commissioner Connor ordered the Police Service to reinstate Hollingsworth to her former position as student police officer and to pay her $35,000 for lost income. The Police Service in turn appealed this decision and, on 22 December 1997, the full bench of the IRC quashed her reinstatement, noting Hollingsworth's deception of the Police Service at the time of her recruitment. The Commission noted, however, \\"room for sympathy for Ms Hollingsworth and the position which she is in, particularly after her substantial co-operation with the Police Royal Commission\\". A counter appeal by Hollingsworth was determined in her favour by the IRC on 21 May 1999. The Police Service was ordered to reinstate her to her former position as a student police officer and to recommence her training with the next intake after 21 May 1999, and that the amount of $35,000 be paid no later than 28 May 1999.. By the time of Hollingsworth's reinstatement, initial police training had been transferred to Charles Sturt University where students were required to complete three sessions of the Diploma of Policing Practice prior to appointment as a probationary constable. Hollingsworth agreed to participate in that program. Despite attempting to study at the College on three occasions however, she was subjected to harassment and ridicule from other students and left the program. In 2006, then aged 40, Hollingsworth launched a last-ditch effort to join the Police Force. She returned to court and sought to enforce the earlier orders to be employed as a student police officer. The court found that the position had since been abolished, and it had no power to vary the earlier decision.. Hollingsworth's business interests now include horse agistment and trail riding. Equine issues Hollingsworth has been a vegetarian since childhood. She became a vegan in the 1990s. Had she gained reinstatement as a police trainee, Hollingsworth intended to pursue a vegan police uniform and footwear. In 2004 Hollingsworth gave evidence against a horse property owner accused of failing to exercise reasonable care for a horse on agistment. She also led protests against the captivity of animals in Australian circuses. In 2012, 11 horses under Hollingsworth's care were seized by the RSPCA and placed under veterinary treatment. In December 2012 Hollingsworth was charged with hindering an animal welfare officer. In April 2013 she faced 11 charges relating to animal cruelty. In August 2013, Hollingsworth pleaded guilty to charges of animal neglect for horses that were seized by the RSPCA in July 2012. She was convicted and ordered to pay costs of $49,180.63, witness expenses of $10,876.60 and veterinary fees of $88,403.36 and prohibited from owning more than 20 horses for 2 years. In November, 2013 the RSPCA NSW withdrew animal cruelty charges for horses that were seized in December 2012, based on forensic evidence. On 19 November 2014 Hollingsworth was convicted of 14 charges relating to neglect of five horses. The charges were contested. The magistrate awarded custody of the horses to the RSPCA, ordered Hollingsworth to pay the RSPCA $114,000 prohibited from owning more than 20 horses for two years and put on a two-year good behaviour bond. Hollingsworth's challenge to her convictions in the NSW Court of Appeal was unsuccessful. In December 2017 Hollingsworth was convicted of multiple animal cruelty charges and given a suspended jail. Hollingsworth was also ordered to pay almost $140,000 in vet and boarding bills. This was in regard to 40 horses in her charge and the 10th time Hollingsworth had been charged with animal cruelty. Depictions in the media In 2002 the Seven Network and Screentime Australia considered a biopic called Blue Lady, to be based on the life of Hollingsworth, depicted as \\"the true story of Kim Hollingsworth's determined, terrifying and courageous journey from stripper to police officer\\". The program did not proceed to production. Following the success of the first two series of Underbelly, the Nine Network and Screentime Australia produced a third series (Underbelly: The Golden Mile) set in Kings Cross, Sydney in 1989. Hollingsworth's character (played by Emma Booth) featured in the series. Executive producer Des Monaghan said \\"It's a remarkable role because Kim Hollingsworth is a remarkable woman. Her story is one we've been interested in for a long time.\\" Hollingsworth is described as \\"one of the series' most compelling characters\\". Hollingsworth was a key adviser on the production. A companion book to the series was published in 2010. Its summary notes \\"Kim Hollingsworth is a policeman's daughter who wants to follow daddy's footsteps. She's a stripper and a hooker but that's no problem ‚Äì until she blows the whistle on bent cops who think they can stand over her\\". In 2010 Hollingsworth appeared in a bikini spread in lads' mag Zoo Weekly at age 44.

K. Arjunan (; 1 March 1936 ‚Äì 6 April 2020) was an Indian film and theatre composer, known for his works in Malayalam cinema and the theatre of Kerala. He was fondly referred to as Arjunan Master. Early Life Arjunan was born at Chirattapalam in Fort Kochi (now part of India) as the youngest of 14 children born to Kochukunju and Paru, among whom only four survived childhood. Losing his father at a young age, the burden of looking after a big family fell on his mother (Parvathi). Unable to provide for all her children she sent Arjunan and his brother, Prabhakaran, to Jeevakarunyananda Ashram at Palani. It was here that Arjunan got his first lessons in music. Every evening, after school, Arjunan would join the other children in singing bhajans. Noticing something different in the young boy, the head of the ashram decided to give him music lessons. For the next few years Arjunan began learning music under Kumarayya Pillai. He later learnt music under K.N Vijayarajan Master. Career During his youth, composing music was another turn in Arjunan's life. After attempts in small-time amateur plays, music composing grew into a serious hobby.

At a time when stalwarts like K. Raghavan, G. Devarajan and M. S. Baburaj ruled the roost, Arjunan managed to break into the scene and establish an identity of his own. \\"Karuthapurnami' was his debut movie as a composer which was released in 1968.

Heart-kun was born in ≈ådate, Akita, Japan on May 18, 2007, at the Pucchin Dog's shop. Born in a litter, Heart-kun was the only one of the group to have a heart-shaped patch. Shop owner Emiko Sakurada, who has bred more than 1,000 puppies over the course of several years, said that she had never seen such unique markings. \\"Kun\\" is an honorific that is appended most often to male names. Heart-kun's owner, Sakurada, has received many requests from people who wish to buy him. Sukarada has rejected these requests, believing that the dog's special patch is giving her and her family luck. Two months after Heart-kun's birth, Sakurada's sister, Maki Matsuyama, won the lottery and a concert ticket. Matsuyama attributes this good fortune to Heart-kun. The pattern of a dog's fur is determined by genes. Heart-kun likely had a heart- shaped design on his coat because he had a collection of genes that induced brown fur, as well as a second collection dictating that the brown fur would be amalgamated with white patterns. Over 200,000 people watched videos of Heart-kun on YouTube TV. Heart-kun became well known in Japan after a Japanese TV station photographed him. In August 2009, Heart-kun sired Kokoro-chan, who also possesses a heart-shaped design on its coat. In the same month, Heart- kun's mother, in a litter comprising four puppies, had a pup named Love-kun that possessed the distinct heart-shaped design on its coat.

Deneen was the gold medalist at the 2009 International Ski Federation (FIS) Freestyle World Ski Championships. In December 2009, Deneen won the US Olympic trials, held at Steamboat Springs, Colorado, securing a spot on the US Olympic Team for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. In FIS World Cup events, he has reached the podium at 4 events in 25 starts, and was the 2008 Freestyle Rookie of the Year. Early life and career A native of the Snoqualmie Pass area of Washington, Deneen was raised in Cle Elum where his family's ranch remains his home. His family's life revolved around the world of skiing; Deneen's father Pat was part owner and general manager of the Hyak ski area (now part of The Summit at Snoqualmie), where his mother Nancy managed sales. The local ski shop was owned and operated by Deneen's grandfather. Surrounded by family and friends, Deneen took his first turns on skis at the age of 11 months, two months after he began walking. His father had brought him to a ski shop asking for the smallest skis they had, and had to stuff newspaper in the boots in order for them to fit. \\"The boot-fitter was just shaking his head,\\" said Deneen's father. After his father found the flattest slope near the lodge, Deneen skied down toward his mother who was at the bottom, turning along the way as people called his name. Deneen was homeschooled, allowing ample time for skiing pursuits, up to 190 days a year. He began competitive skiing at the age of 7 as an alpine skier, and was a top ranked junior in downhill before starting to freestyle. As a junior downhiller he was a member of the racing team at Silver Mountain, Idaho where he and his family spent winters. His competitive endeavors were not confined to the slopes however, he was also a youth champion in the equestrian sport reining. At the age of 15, he gave up competitive horse riding to focus on skiing, and began the transition from alpine to freestyle; at one point he won a downhill race and a moguls contest during the same weekend. He developed quickly as a freestyle skier, and was named to the US Junior Ski Team by the age of 16. Deneen made his first FIS World Cup start in January 2005 at Lake Placid, New York; the following year, after returning from an injury, he was bronze medalist at the World Junior Championships at Krasnoye Ozero, Russia. Professional career Cypress Mountain Deneen had difficulties at the beginning of his professional career; after his World Cup debut, in which he finished 48th, he was forced off the international circuit for a year due to a knee injury. Deneen's bronze medal performance at the 2006 Junior Championships was his first major competition after returning from injury. He spent the following season on the North American Freestyle Circuit (NORAM). With a NORAM dual moguls championship in 2007, he regained his spot on the US Ski Team. Returning to the FIS World Cup circuit in January 2008, Deneen reached the podium with two straight 3rd place finishes at Lake Placid, New York. Over the rest of the 2008 season, he started 7 more World Cup events, with another 3rd place finish at Valmalenco, Italy in March. Deneen's overall performance in 2008, his first full season on the tour, earned him the Rookie of the Year award which is voted on by the international coaches. During that season, Deneen became well known for his speed on the slope, prompting 1994 Olympic moguls champion Jean- Luc Brassard to nickname him \\"The Rocket\\". Deneen's 2009 World Cup season was marked by inconsistent results, including 4 crashes; his finishes ranged from 3rd to 45th and 47th place within the span of one week in January. In February, he finished an American best 4th place at an Olympic test event at Cypress Mountain, the venue for freestyle skiing at the 2010 Winter Olympics. He competed in two other World Cup events in February, finishing 17th and 23rd, before heading to Inawashiro, Japan for the FIS Freestyle World Ski Championships. During the World Championships, Deneen incorporated a new jump into his two clean runs‚Äîthe Back X, performing a back flip while crossing skis. His final score of 23.41 beat the closest competitor by more than 1.5 points earning him the gold medal. The first two events of the 2009‚Äì2010 season, Deneen was unable to finish in the top 20; he however rebounded once again at the US Olympic trials at Steamboat Springs, Colorado. On his final run, he landed a back layout and a twisting 720-degree spin, earning a score of 26.68 which bested the runner-up by fifty-seven hundredths of a point. His win at Steamboat secured a spot on the US Team for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia. In his Olympic debut at the Vancouver Games, after qualifying in 10th place with a score of 23.97, Deneen crashed on his run in the finals. The run was not scored, and he officially finished tied for 19th place.

Scofield c. 1894. The Cuyahoga County Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument (1894) Levi Tucker Scofield (originally Schofield) (November 9, 1842- February 25, 1917) was a prominent architect and sculptor from Cleveland, Ohio. He served as a Captain in the 103rd OVI in the American Civil War and designed many public buildings and several monuments during his career. He was a third generation Cleveland resident and the Schofield Building, which he designed, is named after him.  Early Life  Scofield was born in Cleveland to William Benedict and Mary Scofield. His grandfather, Benjamin Scofield, came to the city in 1816 from New York and was responsible for the construction of many of Cleveland's earliest buildings. In 1856, Scofield's father built the Scofield Block on Erie Street out of which his mother ran a boardinghouse on the second and third floors. Scofield attended Cleveland Public Schools and trained as a builder and architect, working under his father.  Civil War  In 1861, at the age of 19, Scofield joined as a private in Battery D of the 1st Ohio Light Artillery under the command of Colonel James Barnett. His unit took part in battles including Perryville, Chickamauga. When his enlistment ended, he was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant of the 103rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry, eventually attaining the rank of captain in 1864. During his service, he served largely as an engineer on the staff of Jacob Dolson Cox. Scofield published a book in 1909 detailing his experiences during The Battle of Franklin.  Career  Following the war, he briefly worked in New York before returning to Cleveland. Scofield's architectural work is broad and included institutional buildings, residences, and public art. Some of his more well- known projects included the Athens Lunatic Asylum (1868), a Kirkbride plan psychiatric hospital in Athens, Ohio, now on the campus of Ohio University; and the Ohio State Reformatory (1886) in Mansfield, Ohio which served as the backdrop of the film The Shawshank Redemption (1994). His firm designed five Cleveland Public Schools between 1869 and 1883. Scofield was part of a commission established to construct a memorial to those from Cuyahoga County who served in the Civil War. The commission included a number of prominent local veterans including General James Barnett. Despite significant resistance, the southeast quadrant of Cleveland's Public Square was selected as the location for the structure. Scofield served as both chief architect as well as sculptor for what would become the Cuyahoga County Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument. Both Barnett and Scofield are honored with busts above either main doors. Scofield's name is listed on tablet 14. The monument opened in 1894 with a dedication ceremony attended by William McKinley. It remains open to the public and free to visit to this day. Scofield also designed a well-known statue called These Are My Jewels which is a Civil War monument currently on the grounds of the Ohio Statehouse It was initially exhibited at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. Ohio State Reformatory, Mansfield, Ohio (1886)In 1901, Scofield began construction of the Schofield Building, a 14 story structure that would serve as the headquarters of his architectural firm. During construction, a worker named William O‚ÄôNeal was injured when a wall collapsed, burying him. Scofield was arrested on September 16, 1901 for violating local building codes which lead to the unsafe conditions that caused O'Neal's injury. He was later acquitted due to insufficient evidence. In October of 1901, a man fell from the building. Scofield was not arrested due to the intervention of Cleveland mayor Tom L. Johnson who suggested the contractor be arrested instead. Upon completion, Scofield's office was located on the Northwest corner of the building on the top floor which allowed him to look down across Euclid Avenue towards the completed Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in Public Square. The building's red terra cotta facade was modernized in 1969 with a steel and enamel facade. The building was restored in 2019 for around $50 million which included the removal of the modernized facade. The building now serves as the Kimpton Schofield Hotel and the Schofield Residences. Schofield BuildingScofield's personal residence was built in Cleveland's Buckeye-Woodhill neighborhood in 1898. Since then, the mansion has fallen into significant disrepair. Efforts are underway to preserve and restore the structure.  Personal Life  Scofield married Elizabeth Clark Wright in 1867. Together they had five children: William, Donald, Sherman, Harriet, and Douglas. Scofield's four sons all worked at his architectural firm. The Scofields were members of First Baptist Church of Greater Cleveland. Elizabeth Scofield died in 1914 and was interred at Lake View Cemetery in a mausoleum designed by her husband. Three years later, in 1917, Scofield passed away at his home. He too was interred in the family mausoleum. Scofield was the first Cleveland architect taken into membership in the American Institute of Architects. He was known to be a friend and golfing partner of John D. Rockefeller.

Wayne Scott, the executive director of the TDCJ, established the Youth Offender Program, to house prisoners 14 to 16 years old who were sentenced as adults, new arrivals aged 17‚Äì20, and prisoners transferred out of the Texas Youth Commission, aged 16‚Äì18 and with determinate sentences. Rodney Hulin, a 17-year-old prisoner, reported being raped, harassed and assaulted by fellow inmates of his age group after his November 1995 transfer to a division for younger offenders in Clemens. Although he became a symbol of a movement that advocates keeping juvenile offenders housed separately from adults in prison institutions, his case was more complex, as he was attacked by prisoners his own age. Michael Berryhill, a journalist who wrote at length about this case, found that the prison was not yet organized to support its population. After being attacked and harassed, and failing to gain protection from prison officials, Hulin hanged himself. He was saved but had suffered severe brain damage and died four months later.

The interior is arranged around two patios. The first patio is surrounded by a double colonnade (a separate colonnade for each story). The other, farther in, is in the Mud√©jar style, with octagonal pillars, and two Roman-era mosaics. One of these, from C√°rtama, represents the birth of Venus. The other, from Benalm√°dena, is in a geometric pattern. The stairway at the right accesses the upper story, which originally had the same floor plan as the ground floor.

The palace is the most important example of seigneurial architecture executed after the 1487 conquest of M√°laga by the forces of the Catholic Monarchs Isabella and Ferdinand during the Granada War, the last war of the Reconquista; Diego de Cazalla had participated in that conquest. The architectural style is basically that of the Renaissance, with a Plateresque fa√ßade and Mud√©jar aspects. Some of those Mud√©jar aspects may be directly inherited from the previous Nasrid palace on the site: Professor Fernando Mar√≠as states that the torre morisca (\\"Moorish tower\\") adjacent to the Mudejar patio dates back to the old Nasrid palace. This combination is particularly emblematic of the period following the completion of the Reconquista.

Shawn McCarthy. Globe and Mail. 2-Oct-2014\\"SaskPower launches world's first commercial CCS process.\\" SaskPower News release. 2-Oct-2014 In 2015, internal documents from SaskPower revealed that there were \\"serious design issues\\" in the carbon capture system, resulting in regular breakdowns and maintenance problems that led the unit to only be operational 40% of the time. SNC-Lavalin had been contracted to engineer, procure, and build the facility, and the documents asserted that it \\"has neither the will or the ability to fix some of these fundamental flaws.\\" The low productivity of the plant had in turn meant that SaskPower was only able to sell half of the 800,000 tonnes of captured carbon dioxide that it had contracted to sell to Cenovus Energy for use in enhanced oil recovery at a cost of $25 per tonne. In addition to the lost sales, this meant that SaskPower had been forced to pay Cenovus $12 million in penalties. In June 2016, and to avoid paying a $91-million penalty, SaskPower renegotiated its CO2 supply contract with Cenovus. That renegotiation means annual revenues are reduced from $25 million to \\"$16-17 million\\". Over the 30-year project life this represents reduced revenue of $240 million to $270 million and will further weaken the project economics.\\"SaskPower renegotiated contact to avoid $91.8M penalty.\\" The Leader Post. 13-Jun-2016.

Almost half of captured emissions end up being released in the atmosphere by processing in the oil field and the capturing process.http://www.saskwind.ca/boundary-ccs Among other concerns, critics point to the following: * The foremost goal of the CCS project is to keep the aging plant from becoming a stranded asset. * The unfair sharing of the costs, risks and benefits: Energy consumers are said to be saddled with a \\"very expensive carbon tax\\", while Saskatchewan's aging oil industry, namely Weyburn Consortium (formerly headed by Cenovus Energy), which owned the Weyburn oil field until it was sold in 2017 receives a \\"backdoor subsidy.\\" All of these concerns are compounded by a lack of transparency: As of 2015 the project operators had not presented any financial or environmental performance numbers.

Hansard 13-Nov-2014 Annual revenue from carbon dioxide sales is thus estimated at $25 million. Cenovus Energy used the carbon dioxide mainly for field injection work to increase crude oil production before its Saskatchewan operations were sold to Whitecap Resources. Sulfuric acid Most of the sulfur emissions from the power station (predominantly sulfur dioxide) will be captured, converted to sulfuric acid and sold. SaskPower sulphur dioxide emissions are approximately 5 tonnes per gigawatt hour of system generation.SaskPower Sustainability Report 2011. (no longer available on SaskPower site) Given annual electricity generation of 1,010 gigawatt hours, it follows that total annual sulfur capture will be 5,050 tonnes. Fly ash Fly ash, also known as flue ash, is one of the residues generated following the combustion of coal and lignite. In the past it was released into the atmosphere through the smoke stack but pollution control requirements have put an end to that practice. It is now captured by electrostatic precipitators and stored at the point of generation, placed in landfills or recycled - where it will typically replace Portland Cement in concrete production. Typical fly ash recovery rates, for Saskatchewan lignite- fired power stations, are 31 kilograms per megawatt hour.Reference withheld at author request. Fly ash, depending on its use, can attract a range of prices. The best arises from concrete-quality ash which fetches $22‚Äì$49 per tonne.\\"How Much are Coal Combustion Products Worth?\\" The American Coal Ash Association Website. Expenses There appear to be two main expense items: Operations and maintenance, and parasitic load.

There are redoubts at the corners of the wall and at each side of the gates to make the fortress more easily defensible. There are also traces of moats outside the wall. This fortress is valuable remains revealing much information about fortress constructions during the middle Joseon period.

The episode was written by Michele Fazekas and Tara Butters and directed by Marita Grabiak, the first in the series she has directed. It aired in the United States on Fox on October 2, 2009. In this episode, Echo has been imprinted as a mother of a child. However Topher has managed to change Echo on a glandular level, giving Echo strong maternal instincts. This unfortunately causes Echo to be paranoid causing her to kidnap the child. Ballard not only has to find Echo, but is forced to face his past as Madeline Costley, known to Ballard as Mellie, comes back into the Dollhouse for a diagnostic. Plot The episode starts with Ballard walking into Topher's office inspecting the chair. Topher walks in and they discuss Echo's current engagement. Topher notes that he has just opened up a new world to imprinting. By making changes to the brain, he can theoretically program it to fight cancer or even be telekinetic. On engagement, Echo wakes up in the middle of night, to breastfeed \\"her\\" child. In the morning, Echo wakes up and proceeds to take Jack (the baby) downstairs for breakfast. Her husband, Nate who has been working in his home office comes out and is about to leave for work. It is clear that Nate is not prepared to be a father as he is reluctant to hold Jack, while Echo makes coffee. As Echo sees Nate off to work, she notices a black van parked across the street. In the park, Sierra is on the same engagement acting as one of Echo's friends. Echo tells Sierra about Nate's shortcomings as a father and believes he is having an affair or is engaged in illegal activities. Sierra chalks it up to hormones, but Echo express her paranoia at the black van parked across the street. Sierra tells Echo she is sleep deprived and she needs a good nights rest. Back at home, Echo is unable to let it go, and begins to rummage through Nate's home office. When Nate comes home, Echo asks Nate \\"who she is?\\" referring to some photos she found in Nate's office. Nate tells Echo that she was a former lover, but has since died and apologises for keeping it from Echo. Nate tells Echo to go to sleep and he will take Jack tonight. However Echo wakes up in the middle of the night, and overhears Nate telling someone on the phone to \\"get rid of her\\" and he will get rid of the baby. At Perrin's residence, Perrin discusses the lack of evidence he has against Rossum with his wife. The doorbell rings and Perrin's wife goes to answer the door. However no one was there and she brings Perrin a stack of documents left at the doorstep. DeWitt goes to visit Madeline formerly November/Mellie. DeWitt attempts to engage Madeline in idle conversation, but Madeline is suspicious of DeWitt's intentions. DeWitt asks Madeline to come in for a diagnostic, citing she will not take \\"no\\" for an answer. On engagement, Echo attempts to flee the house with Jack. Nate tries to prevent Echo from leaving telling her that her car is in the shop with the baby seat. Nate takes the baby telling Echo to go get some rest, but Echo takes Jack back, citing she needs to feed him. Echo calls Sierra to pick her up. However, as she arrives, so does a black van and Echo watches as Sierra is taken away. Dollhouse staff surround the house as Ballard tries to go inside to talk Echo down. However Echo has managed to escape, taking Sierra's car. In the Dollhouse, Nate is furious with DeWitt. But DeWitt is unmoved citing that with the money Nate has, he could have hired a nanny, but he wanted a mother, someone to bond with his child. Echo attempts to go to the bank to withdraw money. However she spots the black van and runs. Echo is able to find some police officers who take her back to the station to get her statement. Ballard and Nate arrives, and Echo attempts to flee. Echo is hysterical as Jack is taken away from her. In the Dollhouse, Madeline is receiving her diagnostic. As they finish, Ballard brings Echo in and attempts to place her in the chair. Echo manages to escape but is cornered and sedated. Ballard notices Madeline is cut, and takes her to see the doctor. Madeline tells Ballard that Echo will be fine, as she knows how it feels to have a child taken away. She reveals that she had a baby daughter, who had terminal cancer. Ballard asks if Madeline is happy now, in which she replies she isn't sad. Echo wakes up and is wiped. However the wipe seems to fail, as Echo punches Topher, knocking him unconscious. Perrin goes through the documents that were given to him. He realises, the illegal activities that Rossum is engaged in. Perrin's wife says they must follow through with this. Echo manages to escape the Dollhouse. In DeWitt's office, Topher tries to explain what has happened. Ballard believes that Echo is going to get the baby. DeWitt wonders how it is possible as Echo was wiped. Ballard believes it is because Topher, changed her at a glandular level and a normal wipe is not strong enough. Topher agrees and notes that triggering lactation was a step too far. DeWitt orders Ballard to retrieve Echo. At the house, Nate goes to make a bottle of milk for Jack. DeWitt calls Nate telling him to leave the house now, however the power is shortly cut due to a storm. Nate goes back to the bedroom, but Jack has been already taken. As Nate runs back downstairs, he sees Echo holding the baby and a knife. Nate tries to talk Echo down, but Echo is infuriated when Nate tells Echo, she is not his mother. Echo attempts to slash Nate, but feels as if this is not who she is. Nate apologises for making Echo love Jack and then taking him away. Nate tries to talk Echo down again as Ballard arrives. Nate is successful, as Echo hands Jack back to Nate and walks away. Ballard follows Echo to a park. Echo tells Ballard that she does not remember her engagements, but she does remember the feelings associated with each engagement such as love, pain and fear. She notes that it is not pretend for her. Ballard offers to tell Topher what is happening and fix it so she doesn't feel like she does now. Echo says it would be worse that way. She is awake now and doesn't want to go back to sleep. The episode ends with Ballard sitting next to Echo on the park bench. Reception=Reviews Rachel Reitsleff from iF Magazine said the episode had a huge flaw citing that \\"one can see where the work required by the viewer to put together what we‚Äôre being told about Echo‚Äôs evolution could be downright daunting to anyone tuning in for the first time.\\" She also notes that it is extremely hard to relate to the series saying \\"the arc and standalone elements don‚Äôt complement each other very well in ‚ÄúInstinct‚Äù ‚Äì we are told that Echo‚Äôs recent experiences are having an effect on her, but we don‚Äôt yet see that effect.\\" Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a 7. He said, \\"after that jarring beginning, this turned out to be a somewhat lackluster installment, which unfortunately once again brought up some of the show's problems.\\" He notes that there is no real investment into the characters citing that \\"even learning that Echo is now remembering everything after an engagement doesn't change the fact that when she's in the midst of an engagement, she is apparently still not herself.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2009 American television episodes Category:Dollhouse (TV series) episodes ","title":"Instinct (Dollhouse)"},{"id":"25836499","text":"Gnaeus Claudius Severus Arabianus (113-after 176) was a Senator and philosopher who lived in the Roman Empire. Severus was the son of the consul and first Roman Governor of Arabia Petraea, Gaius Claudius Severus, by an unnamed mother. Severus was of Pontian Greek descent. He was born and raised in Pompeiopolis, a city in the Roman province of Galatia. When Severus had come to Rome during the reign of Emperor Hadrian (117-138), he had become a philosophical mentor and a teacher to Roman noble students. Among his students was the future Emperor Marcus Aurelius, with whom he had become friends. In Rome, Severus assumed a reputation as a man of spirit and as a great philosophical mentor. He was a follower of Peripatetic philosophy and later served as an ordinary consul in 146 in the reign of Antoninus Pius (138-161). He married an unnamed woman, by whom he had a son called Gnaeus Claudius Severus. Severus was evidently a politician with a deep interest in political philosophy, as evidenced by Marcus Aurelius‚Äô opinion of him in Meditations (1.14n): : From Severus: love of family, love of truth, love of justice; to have come by his help to understand Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, Dio Brutus; to have conceived the idea of a balanced constitution, a commonwealth based on equality and freedom of speech, and of a monarchy which values above all the liberty of the subject; from him, too, a constant and vigorous respect for philosophy; beneficence, unstinting generosity, optimism; his confidence in the affection of his friends, his frankness with those who met with his censure, and open likes and dislikes, so that his friends did not need to guess at his wishes.

Within the series' narrative, Victor is an \\"Active\\" or a \\"doll\\", one of a group of men and women who can be programmed with memories and skills to engage in particular assignments; in their default state, Actives are innocent, childlike and suggestible. Before having his memories wiped, Victor's name was Anthony Ceccoli. Although Victor does not exhibit the same self-awareness that Echo has, he develops feelings such as love in his doll state. Character=Before the Dollhouse Sergeant Anthony Ceccoli was an Afghanistan war veteran with severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) which he was cured of in exchange for a five-year contract with the Dollhouse. He was transferred straight into the LA Dollhouse and did not meet with Adelle DeWitt as per the usual procedure (in this sense, he is similar to prison recruit Karl William Kraft and psychiatric ward recruit Priya Tsetsang). For the next five years, he serves as doll called Victor. In S1: \\"Echoes\\", under the effects of the psychoactive drug N-7316, Victor (as Tom Voran) experiences a memory glitch: a flashback where he is a soldier trying to save a young woman in a war zone. She panics and runs off, setting off an explosive. In S1: \\"Needs\\", Victor is imprinted as Anthony without any memories as part of an exercise to let the Actives achieve a sense of past life closure: Victor's ends when he kisses Sierra (imprinted as real self, Priya). Their attachment to one another is shown in every identity either pair assumes, whether that means blank state, engagement identity or their real selves. When Victor and Sierra put paint on one another's faces in S2: \\"Belonging\\", he flashes to Anthony's memory of another soldier asking him for orders in the middle of a war zone. Victor then collapses into Sierra's arms, weeping that he doesn't want to be in charge. When he is released in S2: \\"Stop-Loss\\", even the blank state Sierra is able to say he's not ready yet, indicating that his PTSD lingers with Victor at least until he is restored to his original personality. Also prior to the Dollhouse, Victor seems to be a baseball fan, as he is able to recite the entire New York Mets line-up in \\"Needs\\" In the Dollhouse Victor was originally introduced as Lubov, Paul Ballard's informant inside the Russian mob, before being revealed to be a Doll in the third episode. The character is also regularly hired out by Adelle DeWitt herself to be her lover, whom she truly appears to love. In his mind-wiped state, Victor is inexplicably attracted to Sierra despite numerous attempts to wipe away his memories of and feelings for her. Victor, along with Echo and Sierra, is part of a trio of Dolls who continually seek out each other's company during down time at the Dollhouse. Topher Brink writes this off as \\"herd\\" behavior, but the three Dolls show signs of human friendship. Topher first notices something more suspicious than herd behavior when, in \\"True Believer,\\" he observes Victor's erection when in his doll state, which is not supposed to happen. Victor has obviously started to show signs of attraction toward Sierra though he may not realize it at the moment. He has, however, been employed by the Dollhouse long enough to have attracted a regular client, a woman nicknamed \\"Miss Lonelyhearts\\" by the Dollhouse staff. Topher and Dr. Claire Saunders review the surveillance footage of the showers and notice that Victor responds to Sierra's presence, not to any residual imprinting from his engagements with Miss Lonelyhearts. Adelle responds to this news by ordering Victor to be \\"scrubbed.\\" \\"Spy in the House of Love\\" shows that \\"Miss Lonelyhearts\\" is actually Adelle, who has been hiring Victor secretly as \\"Roger,\\" a suave Englishman. After the events of the episode, Adelle says \\"Miss Lonelyhearts\\" will no longer be hiring \\"Roger.\\" In \\"Man on the Street,\\" Victor is suspected of raping Sierra. The evidence seems stacked against him: she screams in response to his touch, she is found to have been having sex recently, and she tells the staff that Victor likes to \\"pretend they were married.\\" After these events, at Langton's instruction, Dollhouse staff members detain Victor and his substitute handler, Bicks (his regular handler is Selena Ramirez). The detention confuses and upsets Victor because, as he tells Echo, he can't understand why Sierra screamed at him, and nobody has told him what action had gotten him into trouble. Fortunately for Victor, he and his handler's incarceration is just a ruse by Langton in order to flush out the real culprit, Joe Hearn, Sierra's handler. Afterwards, Sierra is wiped in order for her to forget the ordeals, and Victor goes to see her while she is reading. He is happy that Sierra is back to her calm self, and after asking her, he sits down to read a book with her. In \\"Needs\\", Victor notes to Sierra that he is aware of what is happening to him while in the Dollhouse but is unable to do anything, in a sense being trapped in his own body and mind. This would suggest he is also developing sentience but in a different way to Echo. He even mentions that he saw Sierra being raped but couldn't do anything because of his doll state. He also always stays up to watch Sierra go to sleep to make sure she is all right, showing more of a developing bond. When he and Sierra encountered Nolan he displayed a protective nature to Sierra by attacking Nolan for what he did to her. In \\"Briar Rose\\", Victor is imprinted with Laurence Dominic's personality to answer a question about a mysterious flash drive. Later, he is awoken in his sleeping pod when a fight between Boyd and Paul breaks the cover, giving him minor scratches. Claire finds him and takes him to her office, where Alpha is lying in wait. Alpha slashes Victor's face with a knife. In \\"Omega\\", Dr. Saunders tends to Victor's scarred face. Victor realizes he isn't \\"my best\\" anymore, and Saunders is unable to comfort him, even angrily announcing that now he is stuck being ugly. In \\"Vows\\", Victor undergoes an expensive treatment to repair his scars, at Adelle's personal request. In \\"Belle Chose\\", Victor is imprinted with the mind of Terry Karrens, a comatose serial killer, in order to find out where his victims are. Terry/Victor then escapes and goes looking for another victim. Topher's attempt to remote wipe him instead results in swapping imprints with Echo, and he receives the Kiki imprint. Kiki's college girl behavior in Victor's male body leads to an altercation with some club patrons which Paul rescues \\"her\\" from. \\"Belonging\\" shows that Victor was one of the Actives hired by Nolan Kinnard to help him seduce Priya Tsetsang. Even in this state, as early as their first encounter he demonstrates that he is attracted to and protective of her. In the present, Victor tries to help Sierra's distress by getting rid of the black paint in the art class, but this sets off another war flashback. When Sierra is sent away, he sits and waits patiently for her to return. The episode ends with him and Sierra cuddling in a sleep pod while Echo watches over them. In \\"The Left Hand\\", Topher imprints Victor with a copy of his own mind to stay in Los Angeles and assist him in recovering Echo from the D.C. Dollhouse. In \\"Meet Jane Doe\\", Matthew Harding has Victor and Sierra are imprinted as a research & development scientists working under Topher to perfect the remote wipe technology. When their successes are demonstrated, Victor and Sierra cannot contain their joys and they begin kissing. Topher wipes them, but Harding nevertheless notices they are \\"grouping\\" and recommends splitting them up. In \\"A Love Supreme\\", Victor is programmed as a Jewish psychologist (nicknamed \\"Dr Freudenstein\\" to analyse the new, wholly self-aware Echo's mental state. Later, like all the other dolls, he is remotely imprinted by Alpha to attack the Dollhouse employees; Topher wipes him with the new device. Post-Dollhouse  When Anthony is released into the real world after five years in the Dollhouse, he has some trouble adjusting. He stays at a hotel and now has a considerable sum of money. At a nightclub he sees a young Asian woman who he mistakes for Sierra. He sleeps in his shower because it recreates the sleeping pod environment of the Dollhouse. He is then captured by Scytheon, a Rossum Corporation-sponsored paramilitary group which recruits ex-Actives into a hive mind supersoldier unit. They are also all ex-soldiers, some of whom Anthony recognizes. Programmer Topher Brink notices when Anthony's biolink feed went offline (still in his 'adjustment' period), so Boyd investigates with the Active Echo, who is self-aware and can access multiple personality skills. Echo is loaded up with more personality and skills packages, and Sierra is imprinted as Priya, and the two track down Anthony. Anthony is able to overcome group mind programming because of Priya's presence. Echo enters into the hive mind and overpowers it with her 40+ consciousnesses. Anthony and Priya are set to escape, but are instead rendered unconscious by DeWitt using the Disruptor, and returned to the Dollhouse, from where they are sent to the Attic by Adelle DeWitt. In the Attic, Victor is caught in a simulation, an infinite loop of war time nightmares. The consciousnesses of Laurence Dominic and Echo enter his scenario. The three track a shadow creature called \\"Arcane\\" into Priya's nightmare; when they catch it, the group meet Clyde Randolph, a Rossum founder and the first victim of the Attic. Clyde reveals the Attic is a network of brains that form a supercomputer; by killing off consciousnesses as Arcane, he reduces the \\"CPU count\\" and impairs Rossum's progress. His nightmare is an outcome simulator: in short, a 97% probable future of societal collapse, as caused by the Dollhouse technology. Anthony, along with Echo and Sierra, allow themselves to be killed in the Attic with the hope they can wake up again after flat-lining and disengaging from the computer system. Anthony stabs Priya, and lets the mob outside kill him. They are successful, and Adelle DeWitt later informs them that she sent Echo (and them) to the Attic to retrieve information on how to defeat Rossum. Relationships=Sierra In the episode \\"True Believer\\" it comes to the attention of both Topher and Dr. Saunders that Victor is having erections. Upon further investigation, it is shown that Victor is actually attracted to Sierra. While being interviewed after Sierra was raped, Victor was asked how Sierra made him feel. He states that she makes him feel better. Dr. Saunders has also observed Victor's feelings towards Sierra. During the self-fulfillment exercise Sierra needed to confront Nolan for putting her in the Dollhouse. Victor accompanies her. During their time together they remember details about their doll state. Sierra recalls how Victor always makes sure she is fine before they go to sleep in the pods. They swear to each to keep looking out for each other before sharing a kiss. Boyd wonders what Victor's self-fulfillment was. Dr. Saunders believes he loves her. Sierra has seemingly reciprocated feelings towards Victor. In the closing scenes of the episode \\"Vows\\" they walk past each other and Sierra notices the scars on Victor's face are gone. They hold hands and walk off together. Priya admits she is in love with Victor in the episode \\"Belonging.\\" When Sierra was due for a treatment, Victor attempted to come with her, however Topher stops Victor and he waits for Sierra to return. Priya states to Nolan she is in love with someone she does not even know. Upon seeing Victor back in the Dollhouse, she asks Topher if the love is real. He says it is and that the feelings are mutual. After being wiped Sierra and Victor walk off holding hands and are eventually seen sleeping in a pod together. In \\"Epitaph Two: Return\\" it is revealed that Priya and Victor have a child, \\"T\\" (Tony), and she is furious over Victor's decision to leave them and become a Techhead. At the end they are a family once more and were last seen reading a story to T while waiting underground in the Los Angeles Dollhouse. Adelle Dewitt Adelle hires out doll Victor as Roger, a British businessman, under the alias Ms. Lonelyhearts/Catherine for both her emotional and sexual needs.

Instead, he received lessons in painting from in Memmingen. Later, he took study trips to Stuttgart and Basel. In 1633, at the height of the Thirty Years' War, he fled to Italy. Originally, he lived in Rome, then moved to Naples around 1649. After a brief stay in Dresden he returned home in 1651. The following year, in Pfuhl (near Ulm) he married Anna Elisabetha Strau√ü.

Originally called Albertland, it was the last major European settlement in New Zealand. The area has become known for its well draining soil, which has made it good farming and growing land. History In 1861 William Rawson Brame, a Birmingham Baptist minister, founded the Albertland Special Settlement Association, organising non-conformist immigrants to come to New Zealand as part of the last organised British settlement in New Zealand. They included farmers, carpenters, servants, butchers, joiners, cabinetmakers, millers, drapers, sawyers, clerks and many other trades.Borrows, J.L. (1969). Albertland. A.H & A.W Reed. AucklandBrett, H., Hook, H.( 1929). The Albertlanders. Auckland New Zealand: The Brett Printing Company Limited. The Albertlanders set sail for New Zealand on 29 May 1862, aboard numerous ships including the Matilda Wattenbach, Hanover and William Miles. The Matilda Wattenbach, which in some documents is referred to simply as the Matilda, made it to Auckland first on 8 September 1862, and the new settlers made their own way to the settlement of Albertland (now known as Port Albert). On 21 January 1862, a party set out from Auckland heading northward along the east coast in a whale boat. On board the boat were two Non-Conformist Settlement Associates, a provincial Surveyor and five men rowing the boat. The group landed late that afternoon at Wade (now Silverdale) where they stayed the night before setting off the next day on foot up the Waiwera Valley having to cross several creeks on the way. From there they set off by boat heading for the Puhoi river where there was a Maori settlement. This area of land would have been suitable for the Albertland settlement due to it covering both the west and east of the Island; however, the Maori had a claim to the water frontage of both sides of the island so landing would have been hard for the settlers. The explorers then surveyed a block just north of Helensville called the Komokoriki block. This block was so overgrown that the explorers struggled to walk through the dense bush and it would require too much work to bring it back to productive farming land. They then heard of the Oruawharo block on the Kaipara Harbour and decided to head back to Silverdale to get fresh supplies before attempting the five-day trek to this block. After surveying the majority of the Okahukura Peninsula the explorers gained information from residents who lived on the Oruawharo River and decided to create the Albertland settlement a few kilometres up where there was good scrubland and bush with kauri for building, using an Auckland Provincial Council scheme which \\"...provided each for a man and his wife, and for each child between five and 18 years old ‚Äì provided they paid their own fare and stayed on the land for five years, built a house, and began farming...\\".\\"The Land and People of Kaipara\\", Waitangi Tribunal A sign at Port Albert concludes: :More immigrant ships followed, but isolation and difficulties of access hindered progress and the original plans for a township at Port Albert were thwarted.

Some sources classified the Palaeoryctidae as a superfamily.  Description  From a near-complete skull of the genus Palaeoryctes found in New Mexico, it is known that palaeoryctids were small, shrew-like insectivores with an elongated snout similar to that of the Lepticids. However, in contrast to the latter, little is known about palaeoryctids postcranial anatomy (the skeleton without the skull). Where the leptictids were short-lived, the paleoryctids seem to have been ancestors of Eocene species. While their dental morphology still indicate a mostly insectivorous diet, it, to some extent, also relate to Eocene carnivores such as creodonts.  Taxonomy  The relationship between this archaic group and other insectivorous mammals is uncertain. Palaeoryctidae was originally assigned to the now-abandoned grouping Insectivora by Sloan and Van Valen (1965) and more recently to Eutheria by Scott et al. (2002). Sister groups include: Kennalestidae, Nanocuridae, Pantolestidae, and Zalambdalestidae. Generally speaking Palaeoryctidae has been used as a wastebasket taxon, but it is now considered obsolete; the only group of insectivorous mammals now considered valid is the order Eulipotyphla.

Another group invented a son for Abdullah al-Aftah, called Muhammad ibn Abdullah al-Aftah, because they unconditionally believed the Imamate could only be inherited from father to son, rather than from brother to brother. This group also claimed that Muhammad ibn Abdullah al-Aftah was the promised Mahdi. As the family continued to grow, an original family tree of the Prophet Muhammad from Imam Jaf‚Äôar as Sadiq to his elder son Abdullah al Aftah is given below. This extensive family tree now extend to the 31st generation, and more than 100 surviving families throughout most continents.  SƒÅhib al-Haqq  In a letter sent to the IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ community in Yemen by Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah, which was reproduced by Ja'far ibn Mansur al-Yaman,  øAbd AllƒÅh al-Aftah ibn Ja øfar al-Sadiq was referred as SƒÅhib al-Haqq or the legitimate successor of ImƒÅm Ja øfar al-Sadiq by AbdAllƒÅh in an attempt to explain the genealogy of his ancestors. Instead of tracing his descent to Isma'il ibn Jafar and his son Muhammad ibn Ismail, the first Fatimid Caliph Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah designates Ja øfar's eldest son  øAbd AllƒÅh as his forefather. According to  øAbdallah al-Mahdi Billah,  øAbd AllƒÅh ibn Ja'far had called himself IsmƒÅ øƒ´l ibn Ja øfar for the sake of taqiyya, and each of his successors had assumed the name Muhammad.  øAbdallah al-Mahdi Billah explains the genealogy of the Fatimid Caliphs and he claims Fatimid ancestry by declaring himself to be  øAli ibn al-·∏§usayn ibn A·∏•mad ibn  øAbadullƒÅh ibn  øAbd AllƒÅh ibn Ja øfar al-Sadiq. But the Imamah (Ismaili doctrine) was later formulated in a different manner since  øAbdallah al-Mahdi Billah's explanation of his ancestry was not accepted by his successors.Farhad Daftary, The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines, pg. 108.

This assertion is contested by others, including many Fathites, who believe that Abdullah died without issue. When Abdullah al-Aftah died without an issue to succeed him in the Imamate, a portion of his followers believed in the necessity of the continuation of the Imamate in the children and the grandchildren of the Imam through pure vertical inheritance. Due to this they could not shift to the belief in the Imamate of the brother of Abdullah al-Aftah, Musa al-Kadhim. They therefore believed that Abdullah secretly had a son, claiming that this son was the Mahdi. They argued: \\"His name corresponds to the famous Prophetic hadith (of Muhammad): 'His name (i.e. the Mahdi) is my name (i.e. Muhammad), the name of his father is the name of my father (i.e. Abdullah).'\\" There maybe evidence that he had a son named Sayed Alawi.

The Supreme Court building is located in Port-au-Prince. History From 1806‚Äì1817, the Senate of Haiti served judicial functions. The Supreme Court was first formed in 1817 under Petion's 1816 constitution as a body of a grand judge, dean, six judges and a government commissioner, all of whom were to be appointed for life. The first Grand Judge of the Supreme Court was Andr√© Dominique Sabourin, who concurrently served as Minister of Justice in Petion's cabinet. Other appointees to the court were: * Louis Germain Linard, dean * Jacques Ignace Fresnel * Jean Th√©zan, * Jean-Fran√ßois Lespinasse, * Thomas G√©deon Christ (who was sworn in later), * Lemerand * Pitre Jeune * Louis- Gabriel Audig√©, Government Commissioner Jules Solime Milscent was also appointed as the first clerk. The Law of 16 July 1954 added a Judge to the eleven provided by the Law of 1918 and since then, the Court of Cassation of Haiti is composed of twelve Judges (including the President and Vice- President), a Government Commissioner, and three substitutes. Composition The Constitution of Haitihttp://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Haiti/haiti1987.html stipulates that Supreme Court justices are appointed by the president from a list submitted by the senate of three persons per court seat.Article 175 of the Constitution of Haiti It is unclear whether they are appointed for 10 years (Art. 174 says so) or for life (Art. 177 says so).IBP, Inc. 2015.

Stotzky, 1999. Silencing the Guns in Haiti: The Promise of Deliberative Democracy. University of Chicago Press. p. 99. . Role The Supreme Court of Haiti interprets and expounds all congressional enactments brought to it in cases, and as such it interprets state law. It also has superseding power over all courts to examine departmental and federal statutes and executive actions, determining whether they conform to the country's Constitution. The Labor Courts and the Land Court are only appealable to the Supreme Court, as opposed to the Juvenile Court and the High Court of Accounts.IBP, Inc. 2013. Haiti Labor Laws and Regulations Handbook ‚Äì Strategic Information and Basic Laws. Lulu.com. p. 103. . If the constitutionality of a law, statute, or an executive action is ruled against by the Supreme Court, its decision can be overcome if the Constitution is amended by the people parliaments or if the Court overrules itself. Decisions by the Court do not pertain to specific cases, rather are intended to encompass interpretation of legislature and executive authority, actually developing the way laws are interpreted. The Cour de Cassation therefore potentially yields the highest power in the Haiti governmental system.Rene Chery, 2011. Women and Children's Tribulation in Haiti. Xlibris Corporation. p. 247. .

These are not only important to the study of the culture of Gaya Kingdoms (1st-6th centuries AD) but are also revealing about how that culture was transmitted to Japan.

He served under James Cook during Cook's second voyage of exploration. Later he led two private trading expeditions that involved collecting sea otter pelts in the Pacific Northwest of North America and selling them in Canton, China, where the British East India Company maintained a trading post. Wintering in the recently discovered Hawaiian Islands was a key component of the new trade system. Colnett is remembered largely for his involvement in the Nootka Crisis of 1789--initially a dispute between British traders and the Spanish Navy over the use of Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island that became an international crisis that led Britain and Spain to the brink of war before being peacefully resolved through diplomacy and the signing of the Nootka Conventions. Due to Colnett's central role in the initial incident that sparked the international crisis, Colnett's account of his second fur trading voyage, including the events at Nootka Sound in 1789, was published in 1940, as part of the Champlain Society's General Series. His first trading voyage journal remained unpublished until 2005. Early life Colnett was born in Devon at Devonport in 1753, and was baptised on 18 October 1753 at Stoke Damerel parish church, Plymouth. His parents were James and Sarah (n√©e Lang) Colnett. He had two older sisters and one younger brother. Very little is known about his life until he joined the Royal Navy as an able-bodied seaman in 1770. Colnett joined the Royal Navy in June 1770, initially serving as an able seaman aboard , and then aboard as a midshipman under Lieutenant James Cook from September until December 1771, when both Cook and Colnett moved to . Colnett served as a midshipman during Cook's second voyage to the Pacific Ocean between 1772 and 1775. After returning to England in 1775, Colnett continued to serve in the Royal Navy during the American War of Independence, being appointed gunner aboard on 1 January 1776 and then as master of . He rose in the ranks, passing his lieutenant's examination on 4 February 1779, and ten days later, on 14 February, he was appointed third lieutenant of .Voyage to the Northwest Side of America, p. 3 He was with Bienfaisant until 1783, when he joined as her first lieutenant. On 17 August 1786 he went on half pay as work for naval officers fell following the end of hostilities. Between 1786 and 1791 Colnett led two private fur-trading ventures. With the Royal Navy's approval and a leave of absence he was first given command of a two-vessel fur trading expedition to the Pacific Northwest coast, Hawaii, and China. The vessels included Prince of Wales and . Afterwards, a second expedition was organized with the Argonaut and the Princess Royal. The second expedition culminated in the Nootka Crisis. The first voyage was under the aegis of the London-based King George's Sound Company, first known as Richard Cadman Etches and Company, which owned the ships. The second was a joint venture of the King George's Sound Company and John Meares and his partners. Both companies were exploring the possibilities of collecting sea otter pelts along the Pacific Northwest coast, via trade with the indigenous peoples, and selling the goods in China. The idea had its origins in Cook's third voyage, during which sea otter pelts obtained along the northwest coast of America, from Nootka Sound northwards, were sold for high prices and great profit in Canton.A Voyage to the North West Side of America: The Journals of James Colnett, 1786-89 (book review) , Journal for Maritime Research First fur trading voyage, 1786-1788 During the first fur-trading venture Colnett was in command of a two-vessel expedition. Colnett himself was captain of the 171-ton ship Prince of Wales. The second vessel was the 65-ton sloop , under Charles Duncan. The ships were owned by the King George's Sound Company, or Richard Cadman Etches and Company, and operated under licenses from the South Sea Company and the East India Company, which had a monopoly on British trade in the Pacific Ocean.The Journal of Captain James Colnett aboard the Argonaut, p. xxi The two ships left England on 23 September 1786, rounded Cape Horn, and reached the Pacific Northwest late in the summer of 1787. After trading for furs with the indigenous peoples in the vicinity of the Queen Charlotte Islands, Aristazabal Island, and Banks Island, Colnett and Duncan sailed to the Hawaiian Islands where they spent the winter. While on the coast of present-day British Columbia they had a series of first contact encounters with some of the Kitkatla Tsimshian. In Hawaii they were involved in several violent conflicts with the islanders, including one at Waimea Bay, during which between five and fourteen Hawaiians were killed.Voyage to the Northwest Side of America, pp. 9, 11, 17, 62, 99, 263-264, 32 During his voyage, Colnett became the first European to see parts of the southern Queen Charlotte Islands. Juan P√©rez had visited the northern Queen Charlottes in 1774, but had not gone ashore. Colnett and his crew were among the first Europeans to set foot on the islands. They were also the first British explorers to contact the Tsimshian and southern Heiltsuk people.Colnett, James, ABCBookWorld Although his primary focus was collecting sea otter pelts, Colnett explored the complex coastline in detail, apparently in hopes of finding the fabled Northwest Passage. His journal contains twelve maps of various channels, harbours, inlets, and other coastal features. After spending the winter of 1787-88 in Hawaii, Colnett and Duncan returned to the Pacific Northwest to acquire more furs. Once on the coast they parted ways and operated separately, unlike the previous year when they remained in company. After trading through the summer Charles Duncan heading south for Nootka Sound. Before arriving he heard from fellow fur trader John Meares that Colnett was not at Nootka. Therefore, Duncan did not stop there but instead continued trading for furs south of Nootka Sound, in the vicinity of Clayoquot Sound and near the entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. In August 1788 Duncan sailed the Princess Royal to Hawaii where he found Colnett and the Prince of Wales. Together they sailed to Canton, China, arriving in late November 1788. They sold their cargo of sea otter pelts. The Prince of Wales was taken back to England via the Cape of Good Hope, but James Colnett stayed in China. The Princess Royal also remained in order to carry out a second fur trading voyage starting the next year. Colnett was given command of another two-vessel expedition. The Argonaut sailed under Colnett, with the Princess Royal under Thomas Hudson. Second fur trading voyage, 1789-1791 During the time of Colnett's first voyage two other British ships, owned by John Meares and his partners, were trading on the North West coast. Meares had chosen not to pay for licenses from the East India Company and South Sea Company, instead striving to conceal the ship's illegal conduct by using the Portuguese flag. During the winter of 1788-89 the owners of all four vessels decided to form a joint venture under the protection of the licenses, although the South Sea Company license applied only to the Prince of Wales and Princess Royal. The joint venture had no firm name; Meares called it variously \\"The Associated Merchants of London and India\\" or \\"The United Company of British Merchants Trading to the North West Coast of America\\". Colnett called it \\"The South Sea Company of London\\". It was loosely referred to as \\"this united Company\\". In early 1789 Colnett was given command of the joint undertaking as a whole. He was made captain of the Argonaut and given command over its tender, the Princess Royal, under Thomas Hudson. The goal of the joint venture was not just to send vessels to the North West coast but also to set up a permanent trading post at Nootka Sound, to be named Fort Pitt.The Journal of Captain James Colnett aboard the Argonaut, p. xxi-xxii, 17 Meares claimed he had purchased land there from Chief Maquinna of the Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka) people. The post could be built on Meares's land. Later, the question of whether Meares had actually acquired land from Maquinna become an issue of contention. Even if he had there were unresolvable questions about the amount of land purchased and its location. In time Chief Maquinna denied that any such purchase had been made, saying instead that the Spanish had the only rightful claim to land at Nootka Sound. Meares, one of the primary forces behind the venture, hoped that a permanent post at Nootka Sound would establish his own dominance in the lucrative marine fur trade. However, before the British ships arrived Spanish forces had already occupied the harbour and established their own fort. By the time Colnett's Argonaut arrived at Nootka Sound, the first phase of the crisis had already begun. The Spanish had taken control of the port and seized Captain Douglas and his ship. Nootka Crisis=Background Before the Nootka Crisis of 1789, Spain had long held that all foreign sailors in the Pacific Ocean were to be treated as enemies. Spanish claims of sovereignty, especially on the west coasts of the Americas, dated back centuries. One of the first serious threats to the Spanish claim came from the extension of Russian fur trading activity from Siberia to Alaska during the middle and later parts of the 18th century. Spain reacted not only by expanding the foothold already gained in Alta California but also by launching a series of exploration and reconnaissance voyages from San Blas, Mexico, to Alaska. The purpose of these voyages was not only to ascertain the Russian threat but to reinforce their claims of sovereignty by right of first- discovery and through the use of formal possession-taking rituals, which were still regarded as a meaningful part of international law. Another purpose was to search for a possible Northwest Passage, which, if it existed and fell under the control of another nation such as Britain, could prove disastrous to New Spain's Pacific coast. Juan P√©rez was the first to sail to the far north, reaching the Queen Charlotte Islands in 1774. Subsequent expeditions were launched in 1775, 1779, and 1788. Detailed information about Russian activities in Alaska was acquired in 1788, including ominous indications that Russia might seize control of Nootka Sound. This, in addition to the rapidly increasing numbers of fur traders working the Pacific Northwest coast--mainly British but also American and others--coupled with Spain's firm claim of sovereignty north to 61¬∞N latitude (the vicinity of Prince William Sound, Alaska), and the lack of any Spanish outpost north of California, made it imperative that a firm stand be taken. During the 1780s Nootka Sound had become the focal point of all these conflicting factors. It was perhaps not the best port of the region, but it was well known and well charted, fairly easy to reach, and usefully located at a general base of operations and a place of rendezvous. Over the years it had become the fur-trader's primary harbour and gathering point. Factors such as these resulted in Russia, Britain, and Spain all deciding to build a fort there, in order to solidify their claims and interests. From Spain's perspective, which had long regarded the entire region as Spanish territory, the occupation of Nootka Sound would be the first step toward creating a new province of New Spain, north of California and south of Alaska. Implicit in such a plan was the restriction of free trade by other nations, a policy the Spanish had long enforced within the lands of the empire.Bodega y Quadra, Juan Francisco, ABCBookWorld The position of the British government, since the days of Queen Elizabeth, had been that its subjects had the right to navigate the ocean and visit, trade, and make settlements anywhere not already occupied by a civilized nation.The Journal of Captain James Colnett aboard the Argonaut, p. xxii The Spanish claim the Sound In 1789 a Spanish expedition under Esteb√†n Jos√© Mart√≠nez set sail from San Blas in order to occupy Nootka Sound. Arriving on 5 May 1789, the Spanish quickly built a few buildings and a small fort with the Spanish flag clearly displayed. Martinez formally occupied the land and began checking the papers of visiting vessels. Two American fur trading ships were already anchored in the sound, one of which was the Columbia Rediviva, and more arrived later, including the Lady Washington, under Robert Gray. Soon after Mart√≠nez secured control of the Nootka Sound a number of other vessels arrived, including the Princess Royal, under Thomas Hudson, along with Iphigenia (William Douglas); the Argonaut, under James Colnett, and North West America, under Robert Funter--all British fur trading vessels. Mart√≠nez was particularly troubled by the appearance of Colnett's Argonaut. Not only was the Argonaut carrying material and supplies obviously intended for the construction of a permanent base, but a group of Chinese laborers were also on board, one of the first examples of \\"coolie\\" labour in the Pacific Northwest. Mart√≠nez, whose warships gave him de facto control, asserted Spanish sovereignty. After a heated exchange between the two men, Mart√≠nez had Colnett arrested, along with the crew of the Argonaut. Mart√≠nez wrote in his journal about personal insults slung at him by Colnett. He was also irritated by Colnett having sailed the Argonaut under Portuguese rather than a British flag, which he felt was deceptive.Nootka Crisis , Beyond the Map After a complicated series of events, Mart√≠nez ended up with three captured ships and their crews, including the Argonaut, Princess Royal, and North West America. Hudson had taken the Princess Royal into Nootka Sound earlier and had been allowed to leave on the condition he proceed to China. Instead, he collected more furs from the region and returned to Nootka Sound, expecting Mart√≠nez would no longer be there. Hudson did not intend to enter the sound but the Princess Royal was becalmed on an incoming tide. A Spanish longboat captured the ship and towed it in. The prisoners were eventually released and the ships returned. The Chinese workers were forced to help build Fort San Miguel, a small battery of Spanish cannon overlooking the entrance to Friendly Cove, the main harbour of Nootka Sound at the time. Nootka Conventions The British ships captured by Mart√≠nez, along with Colnett and his crew, still prisoners, were taken to the Spanish naval base at San Blas, Mexico. In Britain, King George III and Prime Minister William Pitt soon learned what had happened to the British ships, officers, and crews. The arrest of James Colnett, who was after all still an officer of the Royal Navy, was particularly troublesome in England. Angered by the incident and by ongoing competition with Spain for the Pacific Northwest, the British threatened war. France, a Spanish ally, was coping with the early stages of the French Revolution and would not be able to fight for Spain in an armed conflict. Without the French, Spain could not realistically secure their massive North and South American territories in the event of war with Britain. Bowing to pressure from Britain, Spain agreed to sign the Nootka Conventions in 1790, ending the Nootka Crisis and beginning the first phase of the Spanish withdrawal from the Pacific Northwest. Three separate Nootka Conventions were signed and it took over five years to resolve the many outstanding problems. Among other things, Spain agreed to restore the captured ships to their owners and pay them an indemnity. Both nations sent officials to Nootka Sound in order to carry out the details of the Nootka Conventions. George Vancouver served as Britain's representative at Nootka, while Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra served as Spain's. While both were respectful toward one another and even became friends, they could not reach an agreement about how to carry out their instructions. They decided instead to await further instructions. At this time, they decided to name the large island on which Nootka was now proven to be located as \\"Quadra and Vancouver Island\\". Years later, as Spanish influence declined, the name was shortened to simply Vancouver Island.The Voyage of George Vancouver 1791-1795, Volume 1, ed: W. Kaye Lamb, Hakluyt Society, 1984, p.247 Spain continued to occupy Nootka Sound until 28 March 1795. Under the Nootka Convention, Britain and Spain agreed not to establish any permanent base at Nootka Sound, but ships from either nation could visit. The two nations also agreed to prevent any other nation from establishing sovereignty. Further trading After the initial crisis at Nootka Sound, James Colnett was taken to San Blas, New Spain, and kept under Spanish custody until released in May 1790. His company's ship, the Argonaut was returned to his command. He was still not permitted to leave until July, after which he sailed north to Clayoquot Sound where he resumed his fur trading activities. In early 1791, he revisited Nootka Sound. By then Francisco de Eliza was the Spanish commandant at Nootka. Colnett had been given a passport by the Vice Roy of New Spain allowing him to sail to Nootka Sound in order to receive the Princess Royal, which had been seized in 1789, but to then leave the coast because it was, the Vice Roy said, Spanish territory. Colnett was also forbidden to trade with the indigenous peoples. However, when Colnett arrived at Nootka he told Eliza, the commandant, that the passport had been lost at sea. Colnett spent about five months trading along the coast, acquiring about 1,100 sea otter pelts.The Journal of Captain James Colnett aboard the Argonaut, pp. xxviii, 119-120 By the time Colnett arrived at Nootka Sound the Princess Royal had sailed to San Blas, arriving there about 13 November 1790.The Journal of Captain James Colnett aboard the Argonaut, pp. 184-185 Therefore, it could not be returned to Colnett as required by the Nootka Conventions. The governments of Spain and Britain agreed that the vessel would be returned to its owners in Macau. Manuel Quimper sailed it from San Blas to the Philippines, stopping at Hawaii on the way. Another Spanish officer was to take the vessel from the Philippines to Macau. Meanwhile, Colnett, having finished trading on the North West coast also sailed to China via Hawaii. By chance both Colnett and Quimper arrived at Hawaii in March 1791. The two met. Colnett demanded that the Princess Royal be turned over at once, while Quimper explained his orders were to take it to the Philippines. Colnett became angry and prepared to seize the ship by force. The quarrel was calmed by John Kendrick Jr. (sometimes known as Juan Kendrick) who had come to Nootka in 1788 aboard the Columbia Rediviva with his father John Kendrick, entered Spanish service as a pilot, and was now on board the Princess Royal. Quimper slipped away at a convenient time and sailed to Manila, arriving in June. Colnett sailed from Hawaii to China, arriving at Macau on 30 May 1791. To his chagrin he found that the Chinese officials had prohibited all ships with furs from entering the port of Canton. China was at war with Russia and thought the ban on fur trading would injure Russia. The prohibition was imposed in early 1791 and lifted on 30 May 1792.The Journal of Captain James Colnett aboard the Argonaut, pp. 229, 237 Unable to sell his cargo, Colnett sailed to Japan in a bold but unsuccessful attempt to trade there. Thus the Argonaut under Colnett was the first British ship to try to re-open trade with Japan since 1673, when the East India Company's ship Return tried and likewise failed. Eventually Colnett was able to sell some of his furs in northern China. He then sailed for England with his remaining cargo, which he sold to the East India Company for ¬£9,760.The Journal of Captain James Colnett aboard the Argonaut, p. xxviii Later, in 1792, he sailed to the Galapagos Islands on behalf of private whaling interests. His work led to the development of whaling near the Galapagos Islands. The maps from the survey carried out in 1793, 1794 are inscribed by Captain James Colnett of the Royal Navy in the merchant-ship Rattler. Chart of the Galapagos, surveyed in the merchant ship Rattler, and drawn by Capt. James Colnett, of the Royal Navy. Later life Colnett returned to England after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars and was promoted to commander on 19 December 1794. He was given command of the sloop , and in March 1795 examined the coastal defences of the east coast of England from the River Thames to Boston aboard the galley , subsequently producing a report for the Admiralty. He was advanced to post-captain on 4 October 1796 and appoint to command the following day. His period of command was short-lived, Hussar was wrecked off the coast of Brittany and Colnett was captured and imprisoned for six months by the French. On his release he was tried by court-martial for the loss of his ship, but was acquitted. After his release he tried to convince the Royal Navy to launch a surprise attack against Spain's poorly defended Pacific coast. On 29 June 1802, he was appointed to command the transport , on what became his last Pacific voyage. In command of Glatton, he sailed on 23 September with 399 convicts and some free settlers to Australia. Only 12 of the convicts died during the voyage. Before departing Sydney, Colnett unsuccessfully petitioned Governor Philip Gidley King for a free pardon for one of the female convicts, so that she might share his cabin for the return voyage to England.Bladen 1979, p.414 His petition having failed, Colnett set sail for home with a cargo of timber for use in the Royal dockyards. He remained in command of Glatton until 7 March 1805, when he retired on half- pay. He died at his lodgings at Great Ormond Street in London on 1 September 1806. The bulk of his estate he left to his daughter, Elizabeth, although he had never married.A Voyage to the North West Side of America, p. 4 Legacy There are several places named after James Colnett including Bah√≠a Colnett (bay) and nearby Cabo Colnett (cape) on Mexico's Baja California peninsula, ; Mount Colnett on New Caledonia, ; Cabo Colnett (cape) and nearby Bah√≠a Colnett (bay) in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, ;NGA GEOnet Names Server (GNS), National Geospatial-Intelligence AgencyThe journal of Captain James Colnett aboard the Argonaut, p. xvi and Mount Colnett on Meares Island, British Columbia, Canada, .

Severus was the son of the senator and philosopher Gnaeus Claudius Severus Arabianus by an unnamed mother. Severus was of Pontian Greek descent. He was born and raised in Pompeiopolis, a city in the Roman province of Galatia. His paternal grandfather, Gaius Claudius Severus, was a consul and the first Roman governor of Arabia Petraea in the reign of the Emperor Trajan, 98-117. Like his father, Severus was a follower of peripatetic philosophy. Although Severus held no major political influence, he was considered as an influential figure in the intellectual and philosophical circles in Rome. Like his father, Severus was a friend and had a great influence on the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180). It was probably Severus that introduced Marcus Aurelius to the rhetorician Cornelianus and recommended Galen to him as his personal physician. Severus and his father accompanied Marcus Aurelius on a philosophical visit to Athens in 176. Severus served as a suffect consul in 167 and an ordinary consul in 173. In the year of his second consulship, Severus became a patron and was made an honorary citizen of Pompeiopolis. That same year, an honorific inscription, which survives to this day on a statue base, was dedicated to Severus in his birth city: : For the good fortune of Gnaeus Claudius Severus who was consul twice, pontifex, son-in-law of the Emperor Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus, patron of the city, the metropolis Pompeiopolis of the province of Paphlagonia put this up in the 178th year of the province through the work of Publius Domitius Augureinus Clodius Kalbeinus the chief archon.  Wives and children  Severus married twice: * An unnamed noblewoman, with whom he had a son: ** Marcus Claudius Ummidius Quadratus. His birth name is unknown and he is known by his adopted name. Claudius was adopted by the consul of 167, Marcus Ummidius Quadratus Annianus, who was the nephew of Marcus Aurelius. In 182, he was involved in a failed plot to kill the Emperor Commodus (180-192), which led to the former's execution. * After 159 he married Annia Galeria Aurelia Faustina, the second daughter and fifth child born to Marcus Aurelius and Faustina the Younger. They had a son called: ** Tiberius Claudius Severus Proculus, who served as an ordinary consul in 200 and married his maternal second cousin Annia Faustina.

In the 1880s, the Natural History Museum was in the process of moving its collections from the main British Museum site in Bloomsbury to their new building in South Kensington. During that time, Miers published his Catalogue of the stalk- and sessile-eyed Crustacea of New Zealand in 1876 and revised the Plagusiinae, Hippidae, Majidae, Squillidae and Idoteidae in monographs dated 1878‚Äì1881, based on the museum's collections. He also reported on the collections donated by the Admiralty from a number of voyages, including the survey of the coast of Japan by H.M.S. Sylvia (1870‚Äì1877), an expedition to view the Transit of Venus in Kerguelen and Rodrigues (1874‚Äì1875), a survey of the Gal√°pagos Islands by H.M.S. Petrel, Novaya Zemlya by H.M.S. Isbjorn (1879), Baron Hermann-Maltzan's voyage to Gor√©e in 1881, and the voyages of H.M.S. Alert to Patagonia and the Strait of Magellan (1881‚Äì1882). The upheavals at his workplace and the quantity of work to be done may have taken their toll on Miers, and he was \\"completely prostrated with illness\\" for three months. Miers was still working on material from the Alert expedition, when six boxes containing the crabs from the Challenger expedition arrived, sent by John Murray. Describing these crabs would be Miers' largest taxonomic work, one which was published in 1886 as Report on the Brachyura collected by H. M. S. Challenger during the years 1873‚Äì1876 in 1886. Miers' honorarium for this work was ¬£63 (60 guineas; ). Miers tendered his resignation on 30 October 1885. The curation of the crustacean collection was handed to Jeffrey Bell, but Bell only published one paper on crustaceans, and the task of curation was soon shared with Reginald Innes Pocock. Miers lived to the age of 79, and died on 15 October 1930 at Burchetts Green, near Maidenhead, Berkshire. Taxa Portunus trituberculatus, the most heavily fished crab in the world, was described in Edward Miers in 1876.

The daily drama aired on KBS1 from February 1 to October 1, 2010, from Mondays to Fridays at 20:25 for 173 episodes. Synopsis Leading the cast is Kwon Oh-bok (Kim So-eun - in her first ever leading role in a drama series), a talented 19-year-old girl who aspires to be a recognized illustrator and allows herself very little in terms of being swayed by any trials or tribulations. Wanting to find her father who abandoned her when Oh-bok's mother had died 10 years earlier, she heads to Seoul where she earns a living selling her handmade merchandise out of a street-side stall. Very soon, she clashes with Jang Dae-han (Jin Yi-han), an irascible but lonely-at-heart man who also happens to be the head designer for Well-Being Dairy, one of South Korea's largest dairy product companies; incidentally it is also here where Oh-bok later succeeds in gaining employment as an illustrator. Their chance meeting initiates an \\"ongoing battle\\" which eventually unfolds into a somewhat love triangle between them and her old hometown oppa, Ki-chul (Kang Eun-tak). As the drama continues, Oh-bok gets to know Dae-han's younger brother, Jang Min-guk (Lee Hyun-jin), a drifter, upon saving his life when she thought he was trying to commit suicide. And just as Dae-han opens up his feelings to Oh-bok, his first love and the mother of his son, Choi Mi-ran (Lee Sung-min), the only daughter to a rival food company who had moved to the States for an arranged marriage, returns to Korea as a divorcee to reconnect with her life with him and their son.

It is expected to cost ¬£742 million and will be delivered by Network Rail. The programme was initially announced by the Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2006http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/13064417.It_is_surely_time_to_jump- start_electrification_of_our_railways/, and was continued, although cut back from the original scheme, by the subsequent Scottish National Party governments.  Aims  The project will deliver the infrastructure to enable 8 car, electric trains to operate (an increase from the previous 6 car maximum) on Edinburgh - Glasgow services with a fastest journey time of 42 minutes. The additional train carriages will allow a total increase in capacity of 30%. It will also deliver electrification of 94 miles of track including diversionary routes through Cumbernauld and Falkirk.  Timeline of planned improvements  * December 2013 - Haymarket Station Redevelopment opens. * May 2014 - Glasgow - Cumbernauld electrification complete. * May 2015 - Haymarket - Inverkeithing signalling renewals complete. * July 2015 - Winchburgh Tunnel clearance completed. * April 2016 - 61 Bridges and structures cleared for electrification. * August 2016 - Glasgow Queen Street (High Level) tunnel track and trackbed replacement completion. * October 2016 - Platform extensions at Linlithgow, Croy, Polmont and Falkirk High. * December 2016 - Platform extensions at Edinburgh Waverley. * December 2016 - Electrification of the Edinburgh to Glasgow via Falkirk High Line. * December 2016 - Edinburgh Gateway station opened. * 2017 - Millerhill Depot opens. * December 2017 - Delivery of first new Hitachi Class 385 trains.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-38275332 * July 2018 - first Hitachi Class 385 EMUs enter service.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland- glasgow-west-44910925 * December 2018 - Platform extensions at Glasgow Queen Street. * December 2018 - Electrification of the Cumbernauld - Falkirk line. * March 2019 - Glasgow Queen Street redevelopment complete.  Previous proposals  As originally announced in 2006, the project would have cost ¬£1 billion and aimed to increase capacity by increasing service frequency to 6tph rather than by lengthening trains. Transport Scotland commissioned Jacobs to examine the project for potential savings and they identified that the a similar capacity increase could be achieved by increasing train length while maintaining a 4tph frequency. This had previously been thought to be impossible due to restrictions at Glasgow Queen Street station. The redevelopment of Buchanan Galleries allowed this option to be developed instead with a major rebuild and the lengthening of platforms at Queen St high level station. This enabled several major schemes to be dropped from the scope of EGIP as they were only required if an increase in train frequency took place: * Construction of turnback sidings at Abbeyhill Junction and . * Remodelling of Greenhill Junction to provide a non-conflicting junction; * Construction of a new chord line at Dalmeny to allow trains from the west to access the Haymarket north lines without obstructing existing services at the junction on approach to the station.. Another proposed scheme the Garngad Chord, near had already been dropped from the scheme. It was intended to allow Glasgow-Cumbernauld services to use the North Clyde Line into Queen Street Low Level, thus freeing up capacity on the High Level station. Instead services started on this route in 2014 with a reversal in Springburn, creating a slightly longer journey time. Electrification to Stirling, and was originally reported to have been dropped as part of the changes to EGIP. Electrification is continuing and is expected to be complete by 2018; it has been carried out under the rolling programme of electrification, rather than as part of the EGIP programme.  Criticism  The new proposals were criticised by business and environmental groups. Sustainable transport campaign group Transform Scotland described the cuts as 'a major step backwards' and suggested that the government's concurrent decision to bring forward a ¬£3 billion project to dual the A9 road demonstrated a 'perverse set of priorities'. The fastest journey times between Glasgow and Edinburgh under the scheme will now be 42 minutes compared to the just over half an hour previously promised. One of the most disruptive elements of the project was the complete closure of Glasgow Queen Street (High Level) for a 20-week period between March and August 2016, to allow replacement of the track in the Cowlairs Tunnel and the lowering of the track bed to accommodate the installation of overhead electrification equipment in the tunnel. ScotRail warned that the diversion works created a potential single point of failure which could paralyse Glasgow's rail network in the event of a train failure or other incident.

In such cultures, girls' puberty held more significance than boys' due to menstruation, the girl's potential for giving birth, and widespread ideas of ritual purification related to the sacred power of blood. These societies practised various rites of passage, many of which lost their original forms or completely disappeared with the emergence of modern trends such as industrialization. Rites Venus of Laussel Two rules were common in the seclusion of adolescent girls: the girl must neither touch the ground nor see the sun. According to Sir James George Frazer, these rules also applied to divine kings and priests. These divine kings were carried on shoulders by their underlings who walked upon tapestry or carpet. Scholars have speculated that the Paleolithic Venus figurines are related to such puberty rites as they lack facial features (not seeing the sun), their tapered legs without feet (not touching the ground), and their adiposity (caused by seclusion). Among puberty rites which Frazer described, many adhered to the above rules: * Once a girl from Zulu tribes in South Africa showed the first signs of puberty, she had to cover her head with her blanket and hide among the reeds by the river until the sunset. Afterward, she had to stay in a hut for some time before coming back to the society. *In New Ireland and in the Kabadi District of New Guinea, pubescent girls were kept indoors in seclusion for several years. *In many societies, including Brahmins of Bengal, girls undergoing puberty were not allowed to see any males, not even their relatives. Native Americans of California did not allow girls in their first menstruation to \\"look about\\". *Among the Tiyans of Malabar, such girls were not allowed to catch the sight of a cow or touch \\"any other person, tree or plant\\". * Among the Tukuna of the Northwest Amazon, the girl at puberty is kept in isolation for about three months while preparation for the ceremony is underway. During this time, she \\"is believed to be susceptible to all varieties of supernatural power\\" Frazer believed that the Greek myth of Dana√´, who was kept by her father in seclusion but was impregnated by Zeus, was related to girls' puberty rites. Lincoln also finds parallels between the Greek myth about the abduction of Persephone and the seclusion of girls at puberty. According to him, the seclusion of Tukuna girls at puberty may be referred to as \\"being in the underworld\\". Reasons for the seclusion=Preparation for womanhood Such seclusion rites are linked to the social preparation of girls for womanhood and their roles as wives and mothers. During their seclusion, girls would be taught by older women about their future roles. Superstition Frazer claims the reason for seclusion practises was the \\"deeply engrained dread\\" of \\"menstruous blood\\". The first appearance of menstrual blood caused more fear than subsequent menstrual cycles. These fears stemmed more from superstition related to the sacred power of blood than from hygienic issues or the possible spread of disease. Among the Apache Indians, \\"the adolescent girls are not segregated as sources of danger, but court is paid to them as to direct sources of supernatural blessing\\". A girl at her first menstruation was considered to be possessed of \\"a degree of supernatural power\\" which, though not entirely malevolent, still aroused feelings of the \\"power of evil\\". The Bushmen of South Africa believed that making eye contact with a girl during this period would make men \\"fixed in whatever position they happen to occupy\\". In earlier societies, some pubescent girls might have shown some unusual behaviours, giving rise to superstitions. Such behaviours could have been triggered by a number of factors; for example, pubescent girls are more prone to depressive episodes than boys of a similar age. Historical records also show that these girls may have been subjects of incestuous relationships and abuse, triggering abnormal behaviours.

Ushakovskoye was named after the explorer and founder of the polar station in Rogers Bay, Georgy Ushakov, who discovered a number of new islands in the Russian arctic. The settlement was founded as part of an attempt by Russia to assert sovereignty over the island following attempts by British and Canadian parties to claim the island and in 1935 was the scene of a grisly murder by the local Governor. The whole area experiences a severe, almost year-round arctic climate, with temperatures rarely above freezing. History=Early settlement Although Ushakovskoye was to become the main settlement on the island, it was not the first time that attempts had been made to settle the island. From the late 19th century, Canada and the United States were interested in Wrangel Island, and both attempted to claim the island, despite the fact that Russia had claimed it in 1911.Northeastern Border Control, Coastguard and FSB Newsletter, July 1st 2006 During the Russian Civil War, the countries intensified their efforts. In 1921, an expedition financed by Vilhjalmur Stefansson and led by Canadian Allan Crawford attempted to settle a small party to claim the island for Canada, on behalf of Great Britain, with Stefansson stating that, \\"We want to have Wrangel Island for the development of [British] air routes, so that it will be the home base for airships and airplanes in the same way as the Falkland Islands provide a base for our ships and cruisers\\".S. Vinogradov, New Settlers on Wrangel Island, Politizdat, 1981 However, conditions were not favourable, with a lack of hunting available once the expedition members ran out of rations forcing the majority of the party to flee across the Chukchi Sea, leaving party member Ada Blackjack as a castaway on the island for two years.Niven, Jennifer, 2003, Ada Blackjack: A True Story Of Survival In The Arctic. Hyperion Books, New York, New York. 431 pp. In 1922, the Canadian Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King officially announced the Canadian claim that Wrangel Island was British territory. In 1923, in the Bay of Rogers, an American expedition landed to claim the island. Russian settlement Georgy Ushakov, the Arctic explorer after whom the settlement was named. In response, in 1924, the Soviet Union sent the gunboat ; the crew stopped the activities of American firms and Stefensson, declaring the island to be Soviet territory. The Soviet Government, in 1926, declared its sovereignty over the island; and, to confirm this, Ushakovskoye was founded by Georgy Ushakov's expedition on August 14, 1926. Ushakov had stopped off in Provideniya Bay and had brought with him several Inuit families from the village of UrelikiPetit Fute, Chukotka, p.137 The initial population of the settlement included Chukchi and Russian families, totalling about 60 peopleRussian sources identify the Russian families as \\"G. A. Ushakova, J. M. Pavlova, N. Savenko, Skurikhina, Taiana, Tagyu, DMOs, Etui, Nnoko, Kivyana, Pal, Anyalika, Analko\\". In 1928, the first child, PI Pavlov, was born in the village. During the first three years, a hydrometeorological station was established on the island. The settlers established themselves on the island and few chose to return to the mainland after their first posting ended in 1929. Indeed, so successful was the initial settlement that resulted in the founding of Ushakovskoye, that a second village, Zvyozdny, literally, Star, was founded some 30 km west of Ushakovskoye on the shores of Somnitelnaya Bay. Zvyozdny would later become linked with Russian airbase at Cape Hawaii and would become the landing point for supplies delivered to the island from Mys Shmidta as well as mail, which would be delivered to Ushakovskoye along the dirt track which links the two settlements.E. Sashenkov, Chukotka Airmail, Philately USSR, No. 11 - 1982. Murder The establishment of the Russian claim and the settlement was also not without its troubles when, in September 1934, a new governor, Konstantin Semenchuk, previously posted to Iran, took office to supervise the attempts by the Russians to turn the tundra into a vegetable garden for all Russia, allegedly announcing the commencement of his time in office by gathering the people of Ushakovskoye together and informing them that, \\"Up here I am everything. I have all the rights, up to shooting people!\\"Anonymous, Crazy Governor, 1936. Time Magazine, vol. XXVI, no. 22, pp. ??-??. (June 1, 1936). Due to the isolated nature of the settlement, it was only in the winter of 1935, over a year after Semenchuk's arrival, that suspicions were first aroused when Otto Schmidt received a communication from Semenchuk requesting additional medical assistance to deal with an outbreak of typhoid and scurvy, despite there having been no previous outbreaks of typhoid being reported in the arctic. This radio message, swiftly followed by the news that hitherto loyal party member Mrs Wolfson, the doctor's wife, was being returned to the mainland as a result of counter-revolutionary activities, resulted in dispatching of a GPU agent to investigate. The agent amassed a large quantity of evidence against Semenchuk including the murder of the doctor, rape of local Inuit women and assault against the local Inuit men and charges of banditry, a more serious charge simply than murder, were brought against Semenchuk. The case was deemed so important as an example to dissuade other rural governors from lapsing into autocracy that Chief Public Prosecutor Andr√© Vishinsky took personal charge of the trial and, despite allegedly presenting signs of insanity during the trial, Semenchuk was convicted and sentenced to death by firing squad. Modern history The camp of the 1914 Canadian expedition in Rodgers Bay at the site of the village. The settlement grew and developed, until at the end of 1970 it had a school, club, shop, post office, hospital, helipad, a modest museum of natural history, an underground repository in the permafrost for storing meat, a temporary corral (for the slaughter of reindeer), the polar station \\"Rogers Bay\\" airport for An-2, Mi-2, Mi-6 and Mi-8 aircraft, fuel storage and bulk storage of coal, library and a communal bath.Brief history of the settlement by former inhabitant Vasily Prydatko-Dolin Electricity was supplied to the homes. The airbase at Cape Hawaii closed in the 1970s and the settlement of Zvyozdny was abandoned, but for a handful of Chukchi hunters, in the 1980s. In 1984, a monument to Georgy Ushakov was erected in the settlement by the Geographical Society of the USSR,vvv.ru, 100 anniversary of the birth of George Alekseevich Ushakov and the population of the settlement had grown to around 180 people. From the early 1990s, subsidies were reduced and in 1994 the last supply ship brought provisions and fuel to the settlement. Afterwards, cargo and mail were carried by helicopter. People began to leave Ushakovskoye and in 1997 it was decided to resettle the inhabitants at Mys Shmidta. The last resident of Ushakovskoye, Vasilina Alpaun, was killed by a polar bear on October 13, 2003 not far from her home.centralasia.ru Polar bear gnawed the last person on Wrangel Island However, Google Earth satellite imagery dated 21 July 2016, shows that in the preceding two years there had been considerable development of habitation and radar facilities to the east and north east of the village. Weather With a tundra climate (K√∂ppen climate classification ET), Ushakovskoye experiences harsh weather almost all year round, and with temperatures only struggling above freezing for a few brief summer months, with temperatures often below freezing from September all the way through to the following June.

The Malayalam theatre began as an offshoot of Tamil theatre. In South Kerala, the monotony of the sangeetha natakam (musical play) was broken in 1930 by the play Karuna, an adaptation of Kumaran Asan's famous poetic piece. The adaptation was done by Brahmavrathan and the actors Sebastian Kunjukunju Bhagavathar and Ochira Velukutty. This adaptation constituted a radical breakthrough in the 'sangeetha nataka' tradition and its implications were far reaching. It became part of the social reformist movement being led by the precepts of Sree Narayana Guru. It made history, having been staged more than 7,000 times over seven years. The heroine of the story, Vasavadatha, was played by Velukutty and secured him a place in the history of Malayalam theatre. The role of Ochira Velukutty in the growth of modern Malayalam theatre was enormous. When the age ladies were not ready to come up in drama field, he enacted female roles better than real women.

It stems from the term ‚ÄúProtectores Domestici‚Äù, a guard unit serving as the staff to the Roman Emperor. It is said that they originated from being ‚Äúcomes‚Äù, who were companions, or counts in various offices and the emperor, in this case a guard unit. They often held high ranks in various fields, whether it was the servants of a noble house on the civilian side, or a high ranking military position. After serving under the emperor for a certain duration, the Domestici would be able to become leaders themselves and potentially command their own regiment of legionnaires in the military. Relatively, the most important offices were the ‚ÄúComes Domesticorum‚Äù also known as, ‚ÄúCommander of the Protectores Domestici,‚Äù and ‚ÄúComes rei Militaris‚Äù or General.  Origin  The domestici rose to prominence during the Crisis of the 3rd Century, the myriad of societal catastrophes nearly led to the collapse of the Roman Empire. The accession of Diocletian and his subsequent reforms ended the continual strife and unstable leadership Ancient Rome had faced during this period. The title of ‚ÄúDomesticus‚Äù was developed to advocate for better control over the empire. The domesticus provided defined leadership in the military as officers; oversaw individual households and lands to protect common civilians and servants; and served as palace troops assigned to the emperor himself‚Äîall to prevent further crises in the future and transitioning into later periods of the Roman Empire.  Late Roman Empire  The roles of the domestici evolved during the late Roman Empire. From 330 AD to 474 AD they performed a variety of functions. Many held positions as Generals and were even elevated to become emperors if they gained enough notability. Constantius Chlorus was a Domesticus who, after many successful military campaigns, became one of the joint Emperors of the Roman Empire with Maximian. Many of the notable Domestici of the Roman Empire lived around the time period in which the Roman Empire was splitting into its eastern and western halves. Many of Diocletian's successors mirrored his successes because they too, after many military successes, gained a lot of notability and took the throne as emperor from the sitting emperor, although many did not have long reigns because of the instability of the western Roman Empire. These emperors were the ones that did realize, because of their military experience, that it was not possible to sustain the size of the late Roman Empire leading to them continuing Diocletian‚Äôs idea to have it separated into the eastern and western halves. This cycle of instability and military rule in the western Roman Empire continued until its fall in 476, and Zeno the last emperor of the eastern Roman Empire and the First Emperor of the Byzantine Empire where he ruled from August in 476 until his death in April 491.  Byzantine Empire  As the Byzantine Empire was gaining strength, new patterns in governing emerged. Under the rule of the Byzantine Emperor Anastasius I, the successor to Zeno, the title of Domesticus began evolving and was often used as synonyms of Vicarius and Locoservator. The translation of Domesticus, Vicarious, and Locoservator respectively mean belonging to a house, Vice meaning deputy or substitute for a superior, and subordinate to the count or duke. Notable Domestici * Aidoingus *Ammianus Marcellinus *Count Aelianus (prior to career as Count) *Constantius I *Diocletian *Jovian *Magnentius *Maximinus Daia *Tarasis, after successfully plotting against the Gothic general Aspar, he was given this title by the emperor Leo.

The series, created by Ashley Blaker (the original radio producer of Little Britain) and Bill Matthews (co-deviser of They Think It's All Over), was first broadcast on 27 November 2008. The show features three teams of stand-up comedians from different generations: \\"The Up-And-Comers\\", featuring younger comedians, captained by Jon Richardson; \\"The Current Crop\\", featuring comedians popular at the moment, captained by Lucy Porter; and \\"The Old Guard\\", featuring older, veteran comics, captained by Roy Walker, (although in the second series, Adrian Walsh and Johnnie Casson took over for two shows each when Walker was unavailable). Most critics disliked the show. The readers of the British Comedy Guide went as far as voting it the \\"Worst British Radio Panel Show / Satire 2008\\". Format Each episode begins with each of the contestants telling a joke as a warm-up before the first round. The rounds vary between each episode, but the main rounds consist of the panel on buzzers trying to give the best jokes, with Mayo giving points to whoever he feels gave the best material. Between each of the rounds are a selection of \\"Head-to-Head\\" rounds, with two members of different teams trying to tell as many jokes within the shortest time. The winner is the person who talks the least. The final round of the show consists of Mayo giving rapid-fire topics for the panel to make jokes on the spot. Reception The first series of Act Your Age was disliked by most critics. Chris Campling in The Times wrote of the show that: \\"Mayo spent more time describing the categories than each comedian had in which to be funny. Luckily the studio audience was in the mood to laugh at everything so proceedings proceeded hastily enough, if confusingly. Away from the studio, though, and stone-cold sober, I can remember laughing only once, and even that was spitefully. It was when Stephen K. Amos said: \\"If we don't win I'm going to play the race card,\\" and someone else said: \\"As usual.\\" Nick Smurthwaite wrote in The Stage that: \\"It wouldn't have mattered that chairman Simon Mayo's scoring was fashionably arbitrary if he'd made a wittier contribution, or helped the contestants out when they were floundering. Any panel game that is reduced to knock-knock jokes in its first outing is going to struggle to find an audience.\\" Readers of the British Comedy Guide voted Act Your Age the \\"Worst British Radio Panel Show / Satire 2008\\" in the Comedy.co.uk Awards (known at the times as the British Comedy Guide Awards). The BCG said: \\"Of those that voted in this category, almost 100% of people selected this as their least favourite 2008 radio panel show. It is perhaps not surprising as it was clear from very early on that Act Your Age was going to struggle - on the first show, one of the panellists delivered the Dr Who knock-knock joke in a desperate attempt to get a laugh!\\" UKGameshows.com did criticise the show saying: \\"Giving the host the vote for the scoring is never a particularly strong idea (how hard would it have been to have 9 members of the studio audience hold up voting panels or something?), as if you disagree with the host's verdict you end up hating him. The scoring is not accurate enough to be fair, nor silly enough to be entertaining. And like any joke show, many patches are not as funny as the comedians would like to think.\\" However, they did express some positive thoughts saying, \\"some sections are genuinely impressive and hilarious, and how the regulars keep coming up with more and more material is awe-inspiring.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2008 radio programme debuts Category:BBC Radio 4 programmes Category:BBC Radio comedy programmes Category:British radio game shows Category:2000s British game shows Category:2010s British game shows Category:British panel games Category:Radio game shows with incorrect disambiguation ","title":"Act Your Age (radio series)"},{"id":"25837087","text":"The Government Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine (GIRM) is one of the oldest rehabilitation centers in India. Founded in 1926, the Government Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine is the second such institute in India,https://www.kem.edu/about/about-kem-hospital/ after King Edward Memorial Hospital, Mumbai. It is an institute of the Madras Medical College and located in Ashok Nagar in Chennai. It includes a hospital, headed by a director who is also Chief of Post-Graduate Medical Courses of the Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation. GIRM conducts three-year MD (PMR) and two-year diploma courses in Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (Physiatry, otherwise called PMR) for medical (post-MBBS) graduates. The institute hosts allied with Health Science courses and has a College of Physiotherapy, a School of Orthotics and Prosthetics, and an Artificial Limb Center. GIRM was formerly called the Regional Rehabilitation and Training Center under the Ministry of Health, India. History The School of Physiotherapy was started by Professor Vittal Rao, who was trained in the United Kingdom. It began as a one-year training programme, where the nurses were recruited to learn physical therapy. Later, it was upgraded to a two-and-a-half-year diploma programme. In 1981, it was further upgraded to a three-and-a-half-year degree programme. It ultimately attained its current four-and-a-half year curriculum in 1998. The college was affiliated to the University of Madras until the early 1990s and later to The Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R. Medical University, to which it remains in the present. Every year, the college admits 25 students who graduate as Bachelors of Physiotherapy. The students are admitted through open-window counseling by the Selection Committee, Directorate of Medical Education. The College of Physiotherapy has a student association, which has been active since 1990. The association has organized several conferences; CMEs. Physiofest is the college's biggest event. The student association organized five Physiofests between 1993 and 2006. On 14 December 2013, the college established its alumni association and celebrated it as Alumni Foundation Day by gathering more than 250 former students. The event was organized by the alumni working committee and student alumni coordinators. The active Rotaract Club for the Government College of Physiotherapy (GCP) is part of RI Dist 3230. The Rotaract club of GCP has organized several different projects, such as community service, club service, international service, pulse-polio immunization, and vocational service. Karuna Vidya is one of the club's ongoing projects organized in association with the parent club, where Rotaractors and volunteers help visually challenged individuals in their academics. Some of the biggest events of the club include Dreamz Unlimited I, Dreamz Unlimited II, and Village. Dreamz Unlimited I was a one-day sports event designed for the specially challenged in Chennai, whereas Dreamz Unlimited II was a mass 3-dose Hepatitis-B Immunization programme for about one thousand orphans in Chennai. The \\"Village\\" project had the club adopt a village near Singaperumal Koil and assist with its development. The Rotaract Club of GCP successfully launched the project Thalamurai, completing 56 projects in eight hours on 18 March 2012. It was held within the premises of the Government College of Physiotherapy. It received tremendous positive responses from the public and won the award for \\"Best Outstanding Community Service from RI Dist 3230 for 2011-2012. Artificial Limb Center The Artificial Limb Center (ALC) is a pioneer center in Asia funded by the World Bank in 1947. It has assisted soldiers of the Indian Army and hosted trainee doctors visiting from the United Kingdom. The center initially made prosthetics for soldiers, but later expanded its facilities and began to provide for civilians as well. ALC has developed the foot piece in the LE prosthesis called the \\"Madras Foot.\\" Rehabilitation hospital Patients here are referred from peripheral areas of Tamil Nadu for rehabilitation. They are assessed by the team of physiotherapists who prescribe individual rehab programs suitable for various disabilities. They are offered multiple treatments, including Physical Therapy, occupational therapy, psychological counseling, vocational counseling, training, orthotics, and prosthetics. The patient's improvement is periodically monitored. Most of these services are provided at subsidized rates to people in need and free of charge for most of them. Walking School The Walking School is a notable facility of GIRM. The walking training provided here is a primitive approach used in evaluation and rehabilitation, while the method of prosthetic rehabilitation here is similar to the Roehampton approach. There are many technological advancements, such as GAIT labs using optoelectronic camera systems, CADCAM devices, and more. The school witnesses all levels of amputation from pediatric to geriatric, therefore any student graduating from GIRM has the opportunity to master prosthetic rehabilitation.

Almost all scales use some sort of compound lever to work. Other examples include nail clippers and piano keys. Mechanical advantage A lever arm uses the fulcrum to lift the load using and intensifying an applied force. In practice, conditions may prevent the use of a single lever to accomplish the desired result,Popular Mechanics magazine, April, 1924, p. 615-617 e.g., a restricted space, the inconvenient location of the point of delivery of the resultant force, or the prohibitive length of the lever arm needed. In these conditions, combinations of simple levers, called compound levers, are used. Compound levers can be constructed from first, second and/or third-order levers. In all types of compound lever, the rule is that force multiplied by the force arm equals the weight multiplied by the weight arm. The output from one lever becomes the input for the next lever in the system, and so the advantage is magnified. The figure on the left illustrates a compound lever formed from two first-class levers, along with a short derivation of how to compute the mechanical advantage. With the dimensions shown, the mechanical advantage, W/F can be calculated as meaning that an applied force of 1 pound (or 1 kg) could lift a weight of 7.5 lb (or 7.5 kg). Alternatively, if the position of the fulcrum on lever AA' were moved so that and then the mechanical advantage W/F is calculated as meaning that an applied force will lift an equivalent weight and there is no mechanical advantage. This is not usually the goal of a compound lever system, though in rare situations the geometry may suit a specific purpose. Calculation of the mechanical advantage of a nail clipper The distances used in calculation of mechanical advantage are measured perpendicular to the force. In the example of a nail clipper on the right (a compound lever made of a class 2 and a class 3 lever), because the effort is applied vertically (that is, not perpendicular to the lever), distances to the respective fulcrums are measured horizontally, instead of along the lever. In this example, W/F is Note that (7 + 1) cm = 8 cm is the distance from the point of application of the effort to the fulcrum of the first lever, perpendicular to the applied effort. Examples A handloading press uses a compound lever to reduce the force the operator must apply and confine the action to a relatively small space.A few examples of the compound lever are the scale, train brakes, and a common type of nail clippers. Another example is the elbow-joint press, which is used in printing, molding or handloading bullets, minting coins and medals, and in hole punching. Compound balances are used to weigh heavy items. These all use multiple levers to magnify force to accomplish a specific purpose. The train brake translates the force of pushing back the stick to the levers and they rub against the wheels, using friction to slow and eventually stop the train. These are everyday applications of this mechanism. A compound lever translates the small movement of a piano key to the fast, hard strike of the hammer on the stringsA piano key is a compound lever of the first-class, since the fulcrum is between the weight to be moved and the power. The purpose of this lever is to translate a small movement (depression of the key) into a larger and fast movement of the hammer on the strings. The quality of the resulting tone depends on whether the final speed is brought about by gradual or sudden movement of the key.Presser T, Cooke JF. The etude. T. Presser, 1916, p. 497 History The earliest remaining writings regarding levers date from the 3rd century BC and were provided by Archimedes. \\"Give me a place to stand, and I shall move the earth with a lever\\" is a remark attributed to Archimedes, who formally stated the correct mathematical principle of levers (quoted by Pappus of Alexandria). One of the earliest examples of a compound lever is from Han dynasty (202 BC - 220 AD) crossbow trigger mechanisms which featured a triple compound lever. Such a mechanism was placed within the crossbow stock itself. The idea of the compound lever is attributed to the Birmingham inventor John Wyatt in 1743, when he designed a weighing machine that used four compound levers to transfer a load from a weighing platform to a central lever from which the weight could be measured.

The exact origin of the Rosary as a prayer is less than clear and subject to debate among scholars. The use of knotted prayer ropes in Christianity goes back to the Desert Fathers in the 3rd and early 4th centuries. These counting monkeys were used for prayers such as the Jesus prayer in Christian monasticism. The period after the First Council of Ephesus in 431 witnessed gradual growth in the use of Marian prayers during the Middle Ages. According to some Catholic traditions, the Rosary was given to Saint Dominic in a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary and it was then promoted by Blessed Allan de la Roche. While most do not know the evolution of the rosary as it appears today we know there was rendition of the Hail Mary at that time as ‚ÄúHail Mary full of Grace blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb Jesus‚Äù. Thus the later portion, ‚ÄúHoly Mary Mother of God pray for us now and at the hour of our death‚Äù was added later on. At the time of Saint Dominic the rosary was a series of Pater Nosters (Our Fathers) and Aves (Hail Mary). When he received the vision it was the 3 Mysteries consisting of 5 decades each. Joyful Mysteries 1 Annunciation 2 Visitation (Mary going to see Elizabeth her cousin and the mother to be of John the Baptist) 3 the birth of Jesus 4 the presentation of the infant Jesus in the temple (in accordance with Jewish law) 5 The finding of Child Jesus in the temple (12 year old Jesus was found teaching in the synagogue). The Sorrowful Mysteries 1 Prayer in the Garden 2 Scourging at the Pillar 3 Crowning with Thorns 4 Carrying of the cross 5 the crucifixion The Glorious Mysteries 1 the resurrection of the Lord 2 the ascension of the Lord 3 descent of the Holy Spirit 4 the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin into Heaven 5 the Crowning of Our Lady Queen of Heaven The additional mysteries added in 1992 by St Pope John Paul II Luminous Mysteries (prayed between the Joyful and Sorrowful encompasses the life of Christ 1 The baptism of Jesus 2 wedding feast at Cana 3 preaching of the Gospel (Jesus calling sinners to repentance) 4 the Transfiguration 5 Institution of the Eucharist Part of the function of the mysteries in the early part of history was to teach and spread the Gospel. St Dominic was preaching and without books needed an effective way to teach. This was it. The practice of meditation during the praying of the Hail Marys was attributed to Dominic of Prussia (author of Liber experientiae 1458), a 15th-century Carthusian monk, who called it the \\"Life of Jesus Rosary\\" (vita Christi Rosarium). However, in 1977, a theologian from Trier named Andreas Heinz discovered a vita Christi Rosary that dated to 1300, suggesting the origin of the current rosary extends back at least to that time.Winston-Allen, Anne. Stories of the Rose (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1997), p. 17Heinz, Andreas. Die Entstehung des Leben-Jesu-Rosenkranzes, in Der Rosenkranz: Andacht, Geschichte, Kunst, editors, Fredy B√ºhler and Urs-Beat Frei. (Bern: Verlag Benteli/Museum Bruder Klaus Sachseln, 2003), pages 23‚Äì47. The Christian victory at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 was attributed to the praying of the Rosary by masses of Europeans based on the request of Pope Pius V and eventually resulted in the Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary. In 1569, the papal bull Consueverunt Romani Pontifices established the devotion to the rosary in the Catholic Church. In 2002 Pope John Paul II introduced the Luminous Mysteries - based on a compilation by St George Preca, the first Maltese Saint, - as an option in an Apostolic Letter on the Rosary, Rosarium Virginis Mariae. History Prayers with beads like the rosary may have begun as a practice by the laity to imitate the Christian monasticism of the Liturgy of the Hours, during the course of which the monks prayed the 150 Psalms daily. As many of the laity and even lay monastics could not read, they substituted 150 repetitions of the Our Father (Pater noster in Latin) for the Psalms, sometimes using a cord with knots on it to keep an accurate count.Thurston, Herbert, and Andrew Shipman. \\"The Rosary.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 30 April 2014 According to a Dominican tradition, in 1208 the rosary was given to St. Dominic in an apparition by the Blessed Virgin Mary in the church of Prouille.Miller, John D., Beads and Prayers: The Rosary in History and Devotion, 2002 pages 7-15 This Marian apparition received the title of Our Lady of the Rosary.Catherine Beebe, St. Dominic and the Rosary In the 15th century Blessed Alanus de Rupe (aka Alain de la Roche or Saint Alan of the Rock), a Dominican priest and theologian, is said to have received a vision from Jesus about the urgency of reinstating the rosary as a form of prayer. Blessed Alanus de Rupe also said that he received the Blessed Mother's \\"15 Promises\\". Before his death on September 8, 1475 he reinstituted the rosary in many countries and established many rosary confraternities. Despite the popularity of Blessed Alanus's story about the origins of the rosary, there has never been found any historical evidence positively linking St. Dominic to the rosary. The story of St. Dominic's devotion to the rosary and supposed apparition of Our Lady of the Rosary does not appear in any documents of the Church or Dominican Order prior to the writings of Blessed Alanus, some 300 years later. Historical development By the 7th century prayers to Mary were becoming more common.Thurston, Herbert. \\"Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 30 April 2014 The earliest known prayer to Mary is the Sub tuum praesidium, which begins with the words: \\"Beneath your compassion, we take refuge.\\"Burke, Raymond L.; et al. (2008). Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons page 178Mary for evangelicals by Tim S. Perry, William J. Abraham 2006 page 142 The earliest text of Sub tuum praesidium traces to the Coptic Orthodox liturgy and a copy written in Greek dates to around the year 250. Around 1075 Lady Godiva refers in her will to \\"the circlet of precious stones which she had threaded on a cord in order that by fingering them one after another she might count her prayers exactly\\" (Malmesbury, \\"Gesta Pont.\\", Rolls Series 311) During the middle ages, evidence suggests that both the Our Father and the Hail Mary were recited with prayer beads. In 13th century Paris, four trade guilds existed of prayer bead makers, who were referred to as paternosterers, and the beads were referred to as paternosters, suggesting a continued link between the Our Father (Pater noster in Latin) and the prayer beads. It is recorded by a contemporary biographer that St. Aibert, who died in 1140, recited 150 Hail Marys daily, 100 with genuflexions and 50 with prostrations.St. Louis of France (1214‚Äì70) that \\"...knelt down every evening 50 times and each time he stood upright then knelt again and repeated slowly an Ave Maria.\\"Thurston, Herbert. \\"Hail Mary.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 30 April 2014In the 12th century, the rule of the English anchorites, the Ancrene Wisse, specified how groups of 50 Hail Marys were to be broken into five decades of ten Hail Marys each. Gradually, the Hail Mary came to replace the Our Father as the prayer most associated with beads. Eventually, each decade came to be preceded by an Our Father, which further mirrored the structure of the monastic Divine Office. The practice of meditation during the praying of the Hail Marys is attributed to Dominic of Prussia (1382‚Äì1460), a Carthusian monk, who called it \\"Life of Jesus Rosary\\".A Heinz, Rosenkranz, Marienlexikon, Eos, St.Ottilien, 1993, 555 The German monk from Trier added a sentence to each of the 50 Hail Marys already popular at his time, using quotes from scriptures.Mougel, Ambrose. \\"Dominic of Prussia.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 30 April 2014 Promoted by his superior Adolf von Essen and others, his practice became popular among Benedictines and Carthusians from Trier to adjoining Belgium and France. A rosary hanging from the belt often forms part of the Carthusian habit even today.Johnston, William M., Encyclopedia of monasticism, Volume 1 (2000, ), p.246 It was greatly promoted by the preaching of the Dominican priest Alan de Rupe, who helped to spread the devotion in France, Flanders, and the Netherlands between 1460 and his death in 1475. He founded his first brotherhood for praying his Psalter in Douai in 1470.McNicholas, John. \\"Alanus de Rupe.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1.

The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 4, p.756, 2005 Candelaria, Lorenzo.

Stories of the rose: the making of the rosary in the Middle Ages, 1997 p. 69 In the 16th century, Rosary confraternities for women spread in France and Italy, partly because women were excluded from most other societies and because this type did not involve common masses or processions, only private prayer.Black, Christopher F., Italian Confraternities in the Sixteenth Century, 2003 p. 103 In 1571 Pope Pius V called for all of Europe to pray the rosary for victory at the Battle of Lepanto, in which the Christian belligerents included the Papal States. The Christian victory at Lepanto was at first celebrated as the feast of \\"Our Lady of Victory\\" on October 7, but was later renamed the Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary.Butler, Alban. Butler's Lives Of The Saints (April), (1999) page 222\\"Battle of Lepanto (1571)\\", EWTNChesterton, Gilbert. Lepanto, 2004, Ignatius Press  Official approval Our Lady of Lourdes appearing at Lourdes with Rosary beads. In 1569, the papal bull Consueverunt Romani Pontifices by the Dominican Pope Pius V officially established the devotion to the rosary in the Catholic Church.Scaperlanda, Maria Ruiz. The Seeker's Guide to Mary, 2002, p. 151 Saint Peter Canisius, a Doctor of the Church, who is credited with adding to the Hail Mary the sentence \\"Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners\\", was an ardent advocate of the rosary and promoted it (and its Marian devotion in general) as the best way to repair the damage done to the Church by the Reformation.Finley, Mitch. The Seeker's Guide to Saints, 2000, p. 73 From the 16th to the early 20th century, the structure of the rosary remained essentially unchanged. There were 15 mysteries, one for each of the 15 decades. In the 20th century the addition of the Fatima Prayer to the end of each decade became popular. After Vatican Council II, Msgr. Annibale Bugnini, architect of the liturgical reform, proposed further changes to the structure of the Rosary, but Pope Paul VI refused to implement the proposal on the grounds that changing such a well-established and popular devotion would unsettle the piety of the faithful and show a lack of reverence for an ancient practice. There were thus no other changes until 2002 when John Paul II instituted five new Luminous Mysteries.APOSTOLIC LETTER ROSARIUM VIRGINIS MARIAE OF THE SUPREME PONTIFF JOHN PAUL II TO THE BISHOPS, CLERGY AND FAITHFUL ON THE MOST HOLY ROSARY (Dated Oct. 16, 2002) In the 17th century, the Rosary began to appear as an element in key pieces of Roman Catholic Marian art. Key examples include Murrillo's Madonna with the Rosary at the Museo del Prado in Spain, and the statue of Madonna with Rosary at the church of San Nazaro Maggiore in Milan. Several Roman Catholic Marian churches around the world have also been named after the rosary, e.g. Our Lady of the Rosary Basilica, in Rosario Argentina, the Rosary Basilica in Lourdes and Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio in Porto Alegre, Brazil.  Key dates  The table shows key dates in the development of the rosary.: *\\"Hail Mary full of grace\\" prayer employed in a Syriac ritual attributed to Severus, Patriarch of Antioch (c. 513) A rosary from 1475‚Äì1500, Germany. *15th century blessed Alanus de Rupe (Alain de la Roche) established the \\"15 rosary promises\\" and started many rosary confraternities *c. 1514 Hail Mary prayer attains its current form. *1569 Pope Pius V established the current form of the original 15 mysteries *1587 Rosario della Sacratissima Vergine Maria by Ven.

Gallica Online Library Transcribed into Modern English *1597 first recorded use of the term \\"rosary\\" to refer to prayer beads. *1917 Our Lady of Fatima is said to ask that the Fatima Prayer be added to the Rosary. Her visionaries state that she also asks for the Rosary to be said to stop the war. *1974 Pope Paul VI issues the Apostolic Letter Marialis Cultus which devotes 14 sections to the use of the rosary within the Roman Catholic Church.Pope Paul VI. \\"Marialis Cultus\\" *2002 Pope John Paul II introduces the Luminous Mysteries as an option for Roman Catholics in an Apostolic Letter on the Rosary, Rosarium Virginis Mariae. Ropes, beads and prayers A Russian Lestovka. Unlike a Rosary, it has no Crucifix The English word bead derives from the Old English noun bede which means a prayer.The concise dictionary of English etymology by Walter W. Skeat 1988 page 38Your Faith, Your Life: An Invitation to the Episcopal Church by Jenifer Gamber, Bill Lewellis 2009 pages 134-136 The earliest Christian devices for counting prayers trace to the Desert Fathers who started Christian monasticism in the 3rd century.Winston, Kimberly. Bead One, Pray Too, 2008 pages 4-10 They had the habit of praying 150 psalms a day and in order to keep track of the count kept 150 pebbles in a bowl or a bag, and removed a pebble after each psalm. Anthony of Egypt and St. Pachomius are often associated with the development of prayer ropes in the 4th century. These were ropes with 150 knots and gained popularity because they weighed less than a bag of 150 pebbles. These prayer ropes (also called komboskini) continue to be used in Eastern Christianity today. These ropes were only used for prayers such as the Jesus Prayer and the Lord's Prayer and involved no prayers to the Virgin Mary.Kasten, Patricia Ann.

This Eastern variant of the Ave Maria was apparently intended for liturgical use, just as the earliest form of the Hail Mary in the Western Church took the shape of an antiphon. However, there is little or no trace of the Hail Mary as an accepted \\"devotional formula\\" before about 1050. While two Anglo-Saxon manuscripts at the British Museum, one of which may be as old as the year 1030, show the words \\"Ave Maria\\" etc. and \\"benedicta tu in mulieribus et benedictus fructus ventris tui\\" it is not certain when these clauses were first joined to make one prayer See also * Catholic devotions * Our Lady of the Rosary * Rosary * Rosary and scapular * Rosary devotions and spirituality  References  Category:Rosary ","title":"History of the Rosary"},{"id":"25837300","text":"Marie Henri Andoyer (October 1, 1862 in Paris ‚Äì June 12, 1929) was a French astronomer and mathematician.

In the past, Hang Trong painting was an essential element of the T·∫øt holiday in Hanoi, but today this tradition almost has disappeared and authentic Hang Trong paintings are found only in museums or fine art galleries. However, the art of making Hang Trong paintings is always considered a symbol of traditional culture and aesthetic value of Vietnam. Themes and making The common themes in Hang Trong paintings are spiritual and cultural symbols such as the white tiger (h·ªï tr·∫Øng) or carp (c√° ch√©p), which indicate a stronger influence of Buddhism and Taoism than in Dong Ho painting. However, besides the pictures of worshipping themes, Hang Trong craftsmen also made paintings with folk themes like Dong Ho such as B·ªãt m·∫Øt b·∫Øt d√™ (blind-man‚Äôs buff), R·ªìng r·∫Øn (following the leader) or Th·∫ßy ƒë·ªì C√≥c (the toad scholar) for the decoration of families during the T·∫øt holiday. The aesthetic value in pictures of Hang Trong painting is more urban than in Dong Ho pictures which are made in the countryside and often reflect a farmer's perspective. Some popular pictures of Hang Trong painting are Ng≈© h·ªï (Five Tigers), L√Ω ng∆∞ v·ªçng nguy·ªát (Carp Looking at the Moon), T·ª© b√¨nh (Four female musicians) and T·ªë n·ªØ (Virgin Girl). In making a Hang Trong painting, the craftsman starts with woodblocks to print black outlines, then draws the details and finally colours the picture in by hand. Because the main part of the process is made by the craftsman's hands, Hang Trong pictures are slightly different from one to another, thus they become more valuable for the fastidious customers in Hanoi. The paper used in making Hang Trong painting is called Xuy·∫øn ch·ªâ paper (gi·∫•y Xuy·∫øn ch·ªâ), which differs from the natural colour paper of Dong Ho painting. Hang Trong craftsmen colourize pictures with pigments, and therefore the tone of Hang Trong paintings is usually bright and attractive with principal colours being pink, blue, green, red and yellow. Images T·ª© b√¨nh (Four female musicians), a popular picture of Hang Trong painting. History The origin of Hang Trong painting dates back to the 17th century during the reign of the L√™ Dynasty. Different from the countryside Dong Ho, the manufacturing area of Hang Trong painting is located in the Ti√™u T√∫c (later changed to Thu·∫≠n M·ªπ) district in the very heart of Hanoi which is now the quarter between H√†ng Tr·ªëng, H√†ng N√≥n, H√†ng H√≤m and H√†ng Qu·∫°t streets. This was one of the few places where folk paintings were made in Vietnam during the dynastic time. In the past, Hang Trong craftsmen often began to make pictures in the eleventh and twelfth months of the Lunar calendar so that they could meet with the high demand during the T·∫øt holiday when a Hang Trong painting was indispensable for each Hanoi family. For this reason Hang Trong painting, besides Dong Ho, was also called T·∫øt painting (tranh T·∫øt). Hang Trong craftsmen also produced worshipping pictures for Taoist temples and Buddhist pagodas in Hanoi. Today, the tradition of Hang Trong painting is almost lost. New pictures are rarely produced in Hang Trong anymore because of lack of interest among the younger generations; there remains only one experienced craftsman, L√™ ƒê√¨nh Nghi√™n, who can make Hang Trong paintings. As a result, authentic Hang Trong pictures are found only in museums or fine art gallery. Nevertheless, there are several efforts underway to resurrect this genre of traditional art like propagating Hang Trong paintings in festivals, galleries and transmitting knowledge of making pictures from old craftsmen to young artists.

It was launched on the Bolivian market in La Paz, Santa Cruz and Cochabamba in mid-April 2010. Both the name and ingredients are similar to Coca-Cola. The release of this product is part of the process of the industrialization of coca followed by the Morales Administration. The \\"Colla\\" component of the name comes from Qullasuyu, the southern area of the Inca empire which included the western part of Bolivia. The term Qulla is nowadays used to name the Aymara and Quechua, indigenous people of Bolivia which make a traditional use of coca leaves.  Description  The drink has a red label with white writing, is dark caramel in color, tastes sweet and comes in 500 ml bottles priced at $1.50 (around ¬£1 GBP or ‚Ç¨1 EUR). It is made from coca leaf extracts, a plant also known for its use as the base of cocaine powder. This is a restricted substance in many countries and illegal to sell, buy or distribute in North America and Europe.  Use and export  Evo Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous Aymara Indian president, announced last year he will make efforts to support the peoples of the Andes who have been using coca leaves for traditional use such as medication and rituals for thousands of years. of the Andes region is set aside for coca bush growth annually. This area is set to increase to with the increase of the government's drive for legitimate use for the coca plant, such as toothpaste, pharmaceuticals and coca tea. The International Narcotics Control Board of the United Nations has had the coca leaf on the list of dangerous drugs since 1961. Exporting the drink worldwide will not be possible unless drug laws are changed, including local Bolivian law which prevents exporting any coca based product from the country. However, importers from Iran, Bolivia's economic and political ally, have already expressed an interest in over 2 million units of the drink when large scale production starts.  Advertising  A joint collaboration between the Bolivian-based drink's manufacturer and the European-based advertising guerrilla group has been launched to increase the global mass media awareness of the new Coca Colla drink. The launch has sparked worldwide interest about the questionable nature of the product's globally illegal ingredients, even though the use of coca leaf is acceptable by the indigenous cultures which have traditionally cultivated it.

It is sometimes considered a full species, Ardea bournei. History This heron is named after the collector who first recognised it as being different from the mainland species. He was the British zoologist and ornithologist Dr William Bourne, who had a special interest in island birds. He collected a specimen of this heron in 1951, skinned it and sent it to the United Kingdom, by which time it was in a poor condition. The Natural History Museum, London identified it as a rather pale purple heron. It was only after other specimens were collected by Abb√© Ren√© de Naurois that the differences between the island race and the mainland race were recognised. Distribution The only known breeding location of the heron is on Santiago Island, in the Ribeira Montanha village of Banana, in a nesting colony in a pair of African mahogany trees. The population contains about 40 adult birds, or 20 breeding pairs. Status The purple heron (Ardea purpurea) has a wide range and is a common bird and its conservation status has been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of \\"least concern\\".

He is best known for his contributions to churches and schools in the Surrey area. Biography William Howard Seth-Smith was born into a noted Scottish architectural family on 23 August 1852, to William Seth-Smith of Tangley, near Wonersh which is south of Guildford. His grandfather, Seth Smith (property developer), was noted for building some of the most wealthy communities in Central London today such as Belgravia and communities such as Eaton Square and Wilton Crescent.Seth-smith.org.ukOpensquares.org These developments included the original pantechniconA Guide to the Architecture of London from which the name of the van is derived. Seth-Smith attended the South Kensington Art School and became a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1892 and was President of the Society of Architects and of the Architectural Association. In 1880 he designed the United Reformed Church in Wonersh, the Kingham Hill School in Oxfordshire in 1886 in the traditional Cotswold style (completed in 1903),Kingham Hill Schooldays Marling School in Stroud from 1889‚Äì94 and in 1892 proposed an extension of the Camden Chapel, in Camberwell, Surrey but was rejected. In 1896 he designed a memorial in St Paul's Cathedral for General John Inglis, with bronze reliefs by Derwent Wood. That same year, Seth-Smith drew up plans for the St. Thomas Church in Chilworth and made additions to The Royal Liberty School, on Upper Brentwood Road in Romford; notably the porch, garden rooms and vestibule. Between 1896 and 1897 he worked on the Church of St. Luke in Maidstone and the Wesleyan church at Englefield Green in 1904. From 1905 until shortly before his death he was in an architectural partnership at 46 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London with William Ernest Monro. He was also a keen water colour painter, and exhibited some of his works at the Royal Academy of London. His half brother, David Seth-Smith (1875-1963) was a noted zoologist. His half sister E.K.Seth-Smith wrote historical children's fiction. His sister Ethel Margaret married Alfred Hitchens the painter.

First publicly disclosed by Google on January 12, 2010, in a blog post, the attacks began in mid-2009 and continued through December 2009. The attack was aimed at dozens of other organizations, of which Adobe Systems, Akamai Technologies, Juniper Networks and Rackspace have publicly confirmed that they were targeted. According to media reports, Yahoo, Symantec, Northrop Grumman, Morgan Stanley, Dow Chemical, and BlackBerry were also among the targets. As a result of the attack, Google stated in its blog that it plans to operate a completely uncensored version of its search engine in China \\"within the law, if at all\\", and acknowledged that if this is not possible it may leave China and close its Chinese offices. Official Chinese sources claimed this was part of a strategy developed by the U.S. government. The attack was named \\"Operation Aurora\\" by Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President of Threat Research at cyber security company McAfee. Research by McAfee Labs discovered that \\"Aurora\\" was part of the file path on the attacker's machine that was included in two of the malware binaries McAfee said were associated with the attack. \\"We believe the name was the internal name the attacker(s) gave to this operation,\\" McAfee Chief Technology Officer George Kurtz said in a blog post. According to McAfee, the primary goal of the attack was to gain access to and potentially modify source code repositories at these high tech, security and defense contractor companies. \\"[The SCMs] were wide open,\\" says Alperovitch. \\"No one ever thought about securing them, yet these were the crown jewels of most of these companies in many ways‚Äîmuch more valuable than any financial or personally identifiable data that they may have and spend so much time and effort protecting.\\"  History  Flowers left outside Google China's headquarters after its announcement it might leave the country On January 12, 2010, Google revealed on its blog that it had been the victim of a cyber attack. The company said the attack occurred in mid-December and originated from China. Google stated that over 20 other companies had been attacked; other sources have since cited that more than 34 organizations were targeted. As a result of the attack, Google said it was reviewing its business in China. On the same day, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a brief statement condemning the attacks and requesting a response from China. On January 13, 2010, the news agency All Headline News reported that the United States Congress plans to investigate Google's allegations that the Chinese government used the company's service to spy on human rights activists. In Beijing, visitors left flowers outside of Google's office. However, these were later removed, with a Chinese security guard stating that this was an \\"illegal flower tribute\\". The Chinese government has yet to issue a formal response, although an anonymous official stated that China is seeking more information on Google's intentions.  Attackers involved  Technical evidence including IP addresses, domain names, malware signatures, and other factors, show Elderwood was behind the Operation Aurora attack. The \\"Elderwood\\" group was named by Symantec after a source-code variable used by the attackers, and are referred to as the \\"Beijing Group\\" by Dell Secureworks. The group obtained some of Google's source code, as well as access to information about Chinese activists. Elderwood also targeted numerous other companies in the shipping, aeronautics, arms, energy, manufacturing, engineering, electronics, financial, and software sectors. The \\"APT\\" designation for the Chinese threat actors responsible for attacking Google is APT17. Elderwood specializes in attacking and infiltrating second-tier defense industry suppliers that make electronic or mechanical components for top defense companies. Those firms then become a cyber \\"stepping stone\\" to gain access to top-tier defense contractors. One attack procedure used by Elderwood is to infect legitimate websites frequented by employees of the target company ‚Äì a so-called \\"water hole\\" attack, just as lions stake out a watering hole for their prey. Elderwood infects these less- secure sites with malware that downloads to a computer that clicks on the site. After that, the group searches inside the network to which the infected computer is connected, finding and then downloading executives' e-mails and critical documents on company plans, decisions, acquisitions, and product designs.  Attack analysis  In its blog posting, Google stated that some of its intellectual property had been stolen. It suggested that the attackers were interested in accessing Gmail accounts of Chinese dissidents. According to the Financial Times, two accounts used by Ai Weiwei had been attacked, their contents read and copied; his bank accounts were investigated by state security agents who claimed he was under investigation for \\"unspecified suspected crimes\\". However, the attackers were only able to view details on two accounts and those details were limited to things such as the subject line and the accounts' creation date. Security experts immediately noted the sophistication of the attack. Two days after the attack became public, McAfee reported that the attackers had exploited purported zero-day vulnerabilities (unfixed and previously unknown to the target system developers) in Internet Explorer and dubbed the attack \\"Operation Aurora\\". A week after the report by McAfee, Microsoft issued a fix for the issue, and admitted that they had known about the security hole used since September. Additional vulnerabilities were found in Perforce, the source code revision software used by Google to manage their source code. VeriSign's iDefense Labs claimed that the attacks were perpetrated by \\"agents of the Chinese state or proxies thereof\\". According to a diplomatic cable from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, a Chinese source reported that the Chinese Politburo directed the intrusion into Google's computer systems. The cable suggested that the attack was part of a coordinated campaign executed by \\"government operatives, public security experts and Internet outlaws recruited by the Chinese government.\\" The report suggested that it was part of an ongoing campaign in which attackers have \\"broken into American government computers and those of Western allies, the Dalai Lama and American businesses since 2002.\\" According to The Guardian's reporting on the leak, the attacks were \\"orchestrated by a senior member of the Politburo who typed his own name into the global version of the search engine and found articles criticising him personally.\\"US embassy cables leak sparks global diplomatic crisis The Guardian 28 November 2010 Once a victim's system was compromised, a backdoor connection that masqueraded as an SSL connection made connections to command and control servers running in Illinois, Texas, and Taiwan, including machines that were running under stolen Rackspace customer accounts. The victim's machine then began exploring the protected corporate intranet that it was a part of, searching for other vulnerable systems as well as sources of intellectual property, specifically the contents of source code repositories. The attacks were thought to have definitively ended on Jan 4 when the command and control servers were taken down, although it is not known at this point whether or not the attackers intentionally shut them down. However, the attacks were still occurring as of February 2010.  Response and aftermath  The German, Australian, and French governments publicly issued warnings to users of Internet Explorer after the attack, advising them to use alternative browsers at least until a fix for the security hole was made. The German, Australian, and French governments considered all versions of Internet Explorer vulnerable or potentially vulnerable. In an advisory on January 14, 2010, Microsoft said that attackers targeting Google and other U.S. companies used software that exploits a hole in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8 on Windows 7, Vista, Windows XP, Server 2003, Server 2008 R2, as well as IE 6 Service Pack 1 on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4. The Internet Explorer exploit code used in the attack has been released into the public domain, and has been incorporated into the Metasploit Framework penetration testing tool. A copy of the exploit was uploaded to Wepawet, a service for detecting and analyzing web-based malware operated by the computer security group at the University of California, Santa Barbara. \\"The public release of the exploit code increases the possibility of widespread attacks using the Internet Explorer vulnerability,\\" said George Kurtz, CTO of McAfee, of the attack. \\"The now public computer code may help cyber criminals craft attacks that use the vulnerability to compromise Windows systems.\\" Security company Websense said it identified \\"limited public use\\" of the unpatched IE vulnerability in drive-by attacks against users who strayed onto malicious Web sites. According to Websense, the attack code it spotted is the same as the exploit that went public last week. \\"Internet Explorer users currently face a real and present danger due to the public disclosure of the vulnerability and release of attack code, increasing the possibility of widespread attacks,\\" said George Kurtz, chief technology officer of McAfee, in a blog update. Confirming this speculation, Websense Security Labs identified additional sites using the exploit on January 19. According to reports from Ahnlab, the second URL was spread through the Instant Messenger network Misslee Messenger, a popular IM client in South Korea. Researchers have created attack code that exploits the vulnerability in Internet Explorer 7 (IE7) and IE8‚Äîeven when Microsoft's recommended defensive measure (Data Execution Prevention (DEP)) is turned on. According to Dino Dai Zovi, a security vulnerability researcher, \\"even the newest IE8 isn't safe from attack if it's running on Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) or earlier, or on Windows Vista RTM (release to manufacturing), the version Microsoft shipped in January 2007.\\" Microsoft admitted that the security hole used had been known to them since September.Naraine, Ryan. Microsoft knew of IE zero-day flaw since last September, ZDNet, January 21, 2010. Retrieved 28 January 2010. Work on an update was prioritized and on Thursday, January 21, 2010, Microsoft released a security patch aiming to counter this weakness, the published exploits based on it and a number of other privately reported vulnerabilities. They did not state if any of the latter had been used or published by exploiters or whether these had any particular relation to the Aurora operation, but the entire cumulative update was termed critical for most versions of Windows, including Windows 7. Security researchers continued to investigate the attacks. HBGary, a security firm, released a report in which they claimed to have found some significant markers that might help identify the code developer. The firm also said that the code was Chinese language based but could not be specifically tied to any government entity.(Dead link) On February 19, 2010, a security expert investigating the cyber-attack on Google, has claimed that the people behind the attack were also responsible for the cyber-attacks made on several Fortune 100 companies in the past one and a half years. They have also tracked the attack back to its point of origin, which seems to be two Chinese schools, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Lanxiang Vocational School. As highlighted by The New York Times, both of these schools have ties with the Chinese search engine Baidu, a rival of Google China. Both Lanxiang Vocational and Jiaotong University have denied the allegation. In March 2010, Symantec, which was helping investigate the attack for Google, identified Shaoxing as the source of 21.3% of all (12 billion) malicious emails sent throughout the world.Sheridan, Michael, \\"Chinese City Is World's Hacker Hub\\", London Sunday Times, March 28, 2010. To prevent future cyberattacks such as Operation Aurora, Amitai Etzioni of the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies has suggested that the United States and China agree to a policy of mutually assured restraint with respect to cyberspace. This would involve allowing both states to take the measures they deem necessary for their self-defense while simultaneously agreeing to refrain from taking offensive steps; it would also entail vetting these commitments.Etzioni, Amitai, \\"MAR: A Model for US-China Relations,\\" The Diplomat, September 20, 2013, .

Studies in Christian Caucasian History, p. 272. Georgetown University Press.  History  A family legend of the Nizharadze, written down in the genealogical work by Prince Ioann of Georgia early in the 19th century, traces the family's origin to the Persian Nizhad who settled down in Imereti, his descendants being named Nizharadze, ‚Äúthe son of Nizhad‚Äù, after him.Bagrationi, Ioane (1768-1830). Nizharadze (Princes of Imereti). The Brief Description of the Georgian Noble Houses. Retrieved on January 17, 2010 Popular memory has preserved another legend, according to which, the Nizharadze stem of the three brothers from the mountainous western Georgian province of Svaneti, two of whom had moved to Imereti and Adjara. In the kingdom of Imereti, they attained to a princely status and held the hereditary office of Great Pantiers of Imereti. By the mid-18th century, their fiefdom encompassed several villages west of the Imeretian capital of Kutaisi. These were Maghlaki, Kveda Okoni, Zeda Okoni, Opshkviti, Sakulia, Chkvishi, Namashevi, Mitsatsiteli and part of Ternali. The Nizharadze played a prominent role in the regional politics under the last kings of Imereti. Prince Rostom Nizharadze was a son-in-law of King Solomon II of Imereti and followed him into struggle for independence against the Russians in 1810 and ultimately in his Turkish exile. He even petitioned to the Emperor of the French Napoleon I, fruitlessly requesting aid for Solomon.Gvosdev, Nikolas K.

As outlined in numerous studies, erosional events along the margins of the Mediterranean Basin during the Messinian timespan, before and during the evaporite deposition, were common.van Dijk, J.P., Barberis, A., Cantarella, G., and Massa, E. (1998); Central Mediterranean Messinian basin evolution. Tectono-eustasy or eustato- tectonics? Annales Tectonicae, 12, n. 1-2, 7-27. Those authors showed that also predating the deposition of the first cycle of evaporites, a major erosional phase can be observed along the basin margins, corresponding to a major \\"relative sea level drop\\", associated with tectonic activity (marking the end of the so-called \\"Mes-1\\" unconformity bound depositional sequence). Following this assumption that this major event corresponds to the major Messinian drawdown, Bache et al. (2009) concluded that the Mediterranean bathymetry significantly decreased before the precipitation of central basin evaporites. Van Dijk et al. (1998) had termed this end member scenario the \\"Hunchback Scenario\\". Regarding these works, a deep water formation for central Messinian evaporites seems unlikely. The assumption that central basin evaporites partly deposited under a high bathymetry and before the major phase of erosion should imply the observation of a major detritic event above evaporites in the basin. Such a depositional geometry has not been observed on data, as the detritic wedges are merely confined to the basin marginal areas. Another major point of discussion regards the presence of erosional deep canyons along the continental margins of the Basins. These should be expected to be present because of the assumption of a major sea level drop. In fact, they have been described by several authors (summarized in e.g. Clauzon et al., 1996).Clauzon, G., Suc, J.P., Gautier, F., Berger, A., and Loutre, M.F. (1996); Alternate interpretation of the Messinian crisis: Controversy resolved? Geology, 24, 4, 363-366. Most of them are infilled by early Pliocene sediments. As outlined in van Dijk et al. (1998) this phenomenon can be explained in two ways: A major eustatic sea level drop, or a tectonic uplift of the margins (as one associated with a minor sea level drop). It constitutes, therefore, not a real proof for the desiccation of an existing originally deep basin. The third much-disputed element is the recognition of the so-called \\"MES\\", the Messinian Erosional Surface. This surface can well be traced in seismic sections along the Basin margins, showing angular and non- angular unconformities, somewhere within the evaporite deposits, or between evaporite and non-evaporite deposits. Nice examples are shown by Roveri et al. (2008).Roveri, M., Bertini, A., Cosentino, D., Di Stefano, A., Gennari, R., Gliozzi, E., Grossi, F., Iaccarino, S.M., Lugli, S., Manzi, V., and Taviani, M. (2008); A high-resolution stratigraphic framework for the latest Messinian events in the Mediterranean area. Stratigraphy, vol. 5, nos. 3-4, pp. 323-342, text-figures 1-9. As already extensively discussed in van Dijk (1992),van Dijk, J.P. (1992, d); Late Neogene fore-arc basin evolution in the Calabrian Arc (Central Mediterranean). Tectonic sequence stratigraphy and dynamic geohistory. With special reference to the geology of Central Calabria. Geologica Ultrajectina, 92, 288 pp. the erosional surfaces within the Messinian clastic and evaporitic and mixed series are often confused. Only very high resolution and complete series such as those in the Crotone Basin in Calabria can solve this matter, and the authors have shown that the erosional surfaces and there probable relationships with relative sea level fluctuations and tectonic activity can be mapped well (see review in van Dijk et al., 1998).

At certain conditions some operations, as adding, doubling or tripling points, are faster to compute using this form. The Tripling oriented Doche‚ÄìIcart‚ÄìKohel curve, often called with the abbreviation 3DIK has been introduced by Christophe Doche, Thomas Icart, and David R. Kohel in Christophe Doche, Thomas Icart, and David R. Kohel, Efficient Scalar Multiplication by Isogeny Decompositions Definition A tripling-oriented Doche‚ÄìIcart‚ÄìKohel curve of equation y^2=x^3 - 3x^2 - 6x - 3 Let K be a field of characteristic different form 2 and 3. An elliptic curve in tripling oriented Doche‚ÄìIcart‚ÄìKohel form is defined by the equation: : T_a\\\\ :\\\\ y^2 = x^3 + 3a(x+1)^2 with a\\\\in K. A general point P on T_{a} has affine coordinates (x,y). The \\"point at infinity\\" represents the neutral element for the group law and it is written in projective coordinates as O = (0:1:0). The negation of a point P = (x, y) with respect to this neutral element is ‚àíP = (x, ‚àíy). The group law Consider an elliptic curve in the Tripling-oriented Doche-Icart-Kohel form in affine coordinates: : T_a:\\\\quad y^2= x^3 + 3a(x+1)^2, \\\\qquad a eq 0, \\\\tfrac{9}{4}. As in other forms of elliptic curves, it is possible to define some \\"operations\\" between points, such as adding points, or doubling (See also The group law). In the following sections formulas to add, negate and doubling points are given. The addition and doubling formulas are often used for other operations: given a point P on an elliptic curve it is possible to compute [n]P, where n is an integer, using addition and doubling; computing multiples of points is important in elliptic curve cryptography and in Lenstra elliptic curve factorization. Addition Given P_1=(x_1,y_1) and P_2=(x_2,y_2) on T_{a}, the point P_3=(x_3,y_3)=P_1+P_2 has coordinates: :\\\\begin{align} x_3 &= \\\\frac{1}{(x_2 - x_1)^2} \\\\left { -x_1^3+(x_2-3a)x_1^2+(x_2^2+6ax_2)x_1+(y_1^2-2y_2y_1+(-x_2^3-3ax_2^2+y_2^2)) \\\\right } \\\\ y_3 &= \\\\frac{1}{(x_2 - x_1)^3} \\\\left { (-y_1+2y_2)x_1^3+(-3ay_1-3y_2x_2+3ay_2)x_1^2+(3x_2^2y_1+6ax_2y_1-6ay_2x_2)x_1 \\\\right.\\\\ &\\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\left.+(y_1^3-3y_2y_1^2+(-2x_2^3-3ax_2^2+3y_2^2)y_1+(y_2x_2^3+3ay_2x_2^2-y_2^3)) \\\\right } \\\\end{align} Doubling Given a point P_1=(x_1,y_1) on T_{a}, the point P_3=(x_3,y_3)=2P_1 has coordinates: :\\\\begin{align} x_3 &= \\\\frac{9}{4y_1^2 x_1^4}+\\\\frac{9}{y_1^2ax_1^3}+ \\\\left (\\\\frac{9}{y_1^2a^2}+\\\\frac{9}{y_1^2a} \\\\right )x_1^2+ \\\\left (\\\\frac{18}{y_1^2a^2}-2 \\\\right ) x_1+\\\\frac{9}{y_1^2a^2-3a} \\\\ y_3 &= -\\\\frac{27}{8y_1^3x_1^6}-\\\\frac{81}{4y_1^3ax_1^5}+ \\\\left (-\\\\frac{81}{2y_1^3a^2}-\\\\frac{81}{4y_1^3a} \\\\right )x_1^4+ \\\\left (-\\\\frac{27}{y_1^3a^3}-\\\\frac{81}{y_1^3a^2}+\\\\frac{9}{2y_1} \\\\right )x_1^3+ \\\\left (-\\\\frac{81}{y_1^3a^3}-\\\\frac{81}{2y_1^3}a^2+\\\\frac{27}{2y_1a} \\\\right)x_1^2 \\\\ & \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad+ \\\\left (-\\\\frac{81}{y_1^3a^3}+\\\\frac{9}{y_1a^2}+\\\\frac{9}{y_1a} \\\\right )x_1 + \\\\left (-\\\\frac{27}{y_1^3a^3}+\\\\frac{9}{y_1a^2}-y_1 \\\\right ) \\\\end{align} Negation Given a point P_1=(x_1,y_1) on T_{a}, its negation with respect to the neutral element (0:1:0) is -P_1=(x_1,-y_1). There are also other formulas given in Christophe Doche, Thomas Icart, and David R. Kohel, Efficient Scalar Multiplication by Isogeny Decompositions, pag 198-199 for Tripling-oriented Doche‚ÄìIcart‚ÄìKohel curves for fast tripling operation and mixed-addition. New Jacobian coordinates For computing on these curves points are usually represented in new Jacobian coordinates (Jn): a point in the new Jacobian coordinates is of the form P=(X : Y : Z : Z^2); moreover: : P= (X:Y:Z:Z^{2}) = (\\\\lambda^{2}X:\\\\lambda^{3}Y:\\\\lambda Z:\\\\lambda^{2}Z^{2}), for any \\\\lambda \\\\in K. This means, for example, that the point P=(X:Y:Z:Z^2) and the point Q=(4X:8Y:2Z:4Z^2) (for \\\\lambda=2) are actually the same. So, an affine point P=(x,y) on T_{a} is written in the new Jacobian coordinates as P=(X : Y : Z : Z^2), where x = X/Z^2 and y = Y/Z^3; in this way, the equation for T_{a} becomes: : T_a\\\\ :\\\\ Y^2 = X^3 + 3aZ^2(X+Z^2)^2. The term Z^2 of a point on the curve makes the mixed addition (that is the addition between two points in different systems of coordinates) more efficient. The neutral element in new Jacobian coordinates is (1:1:0:0). Algorithms and examples=Addition The following algorithm represents the sum of two points P_1 and P_2 on an elliptic curve in the Tripling-oriented Doche-Icart-Kohel form. The result is a point P_3=(X_3,Y_3,Z_3,ZZ_3). It is assumed that Z_2=1 and that a_3=3a. The cost of this implementation is 7M + 4S + 1*a3 + 10add + 3*2 + 1*4, where M indicates the multiplications, S the squarings, a3 indicates the multiplication by the constant a3, add represents the number of additions required. A = X_2ZZ_1 B = Y_2ZZ_1Z_1 C = X_1-A D = 2(Y_1-B) F = C^2 F_4 = 4F Z_3 = (Z_1+C)^2-ZZ_1-F E = {Z_3}^2 G = CF_4 H = AF_4 X_3 = D^2-G-2H-a_3E Y_3 = D(H-X_3)-2BG ZZ_3 = E =Example= Let P_1=(1,\\\\sqrt{13}) and P_2=(0,\\\\sqrt{3}) affine points on the elliptic curve over \\\\mathbb{R}: y^2 = x^3 +3(x+1)^2. Then: A = X_2ZZ_1 = 0 B = Y_2ZZ_1Z_1 = \\\\sqrt{3} C = X_1-A = 1 D = 2(Y_1-B) = 2(\\\\sqrt{13}-\\\\sqrt{3}) F = C^2 = 1 F_4 = 4F = 4 Z_3 = (Z_1+C)^2-ZZ_1-F = 2 E = {Z_3}^2 = 4 G = CF_4 = 4 H = AF_4 = 0 X_3 = D^2-G-2H-a_3E = 48-8\\\\sqrt{39} Y_3 = D(H-X_3)-2BG = 296\\\\sqrt{3}-144\\\\sqrt{13} ZZ_3 = E = 4 Notice that in this case Z_1=Z_2=1. The resulting point is P_3 = (X_3,Y_3,Z_3,ZZ_3) = (48-8\\\\sqrt{39},296\\\\sqrt{3}-144\\\\sqrt{13},2,4), that in affine coordinates is P_3=(12-2\\\\sqrt{39},37\\\\sqrt{3}-18\\\\sqrt{13}). Doubling The following algorithm represents the doubling of a point P_1 on an elliptic curve in the Tripling-oriented Doche-Icart-Kohel form. It is assumed that a_3=3a, a_2=2a. The cost of this implementation is 2M + 7S + 1*a2 + 1*a3 + 12add + 2*2 + 1*3 + 1*8; here M represents the multiplications, S the squarings, a2 and a3 indicates the multiplications by the constants a2 and a3 respectively, and add indicates the additions. A = {X_1}^2 B = a_2ZZ_1(X_1+ZZ_1) C = 3(A+B) D = {Y_1}^2 E = D^2 Z_3 = (Y_1+Z_1)^2-D-ZZ_1 ZZ_3 = Z_3^2 F = 2((X_1+D)^2-A-E) X_3 = C^2-a_3ZZ_3-2F Y_3 = C(F-X_3)-8E =Example= Let P_1=(0,\\\\sqrt{3}) be a point on y^2 = x^3 + 3(x+1)^2. Then: A = {X_1}^2 = 0 B = a_2ZZ_1(X_1+ZZ_1) = 2 C = 3(A+B) = 6 D = {Y_1}^2 = 3 E = D^2 = 9 Z_3 = (Y_1+Z_1)^2-D-ZZ_1 = 2\\\\sqrt{3} ZZ_3 = Z_3^2 = 12 F = 2((X_1+D)^2-A-E) = 0 X_3 = C^2-a_3ZZ_3-2F = 0 Y_3 = C(F-X_3)-8E = -72 Notice that here the point is in affine coordinates, so Z_1=1. The resulting point is P_3=(0,-72,2\\\\sqrt{3},12), that in affine coordinates is P_3 = (0,-\\\\sqrt{3}). Equivalence with Weierstrass form Any elliptic curve is birationally equivalent to another written in the Weierstrass form. The following twisted tripling-oriented Doche-Icart-Kohel curve: :T_{a,\\\\lambda}: \\\\quad y^2 = x^3 + 3\\\\lambda a(x+\\\\lambda)^2 can be transformed into the Weierstrass form by the map: :(x,y)\\\\mapsto (x-\\\\lambda a, y). In this way T_{a,\\\\lambda} becomes: :y^2 = x^3 - 3{\\\\lambda}^2a(a-2)x + {\\\\lambda}^3a(2a^2-6a+3). Conversely, given an elliptic curve in the Weierstrass form: :E_{c,d}: \\\\quad y^2 = x^3 +cx^2 +d, it is possible to find the \\"corresponding\\" Tripling-oriented Doche‚ÄìIcart‚ÄìKohel curve, using the following relation: :\\\\lambda = \\\\frac{-3d(a-2)}{a(2a^2-6a+3)} where is a root of the polynomial :6912a(a-2)^3-j(4a-9), where :j=\\\\frac{6912c^3}{4c^3+27d^2} is the j-invariant of the elliptic curve E_{c,d}. Notice that in this case the map given is not only a birational equivalence, but an isomorphism between curves.

It is based on the iconic 1881 novel Heidi by Johanna Spyri, and stars Irish child actress Emma Bolger in the title role, alongside Max Von Sydow and Diana Rigg. Plot The story is about the titular young girl who goes to stay with her grandfather, in the Swiss Alps. She becomes close friend of the young boy, Peter the goatherd and often she goes with him and his goats on the mountains. Later, she goes to stay with the rich family Sesemann in Frankfurt, to be a hired companion to Clara Sesemann, who is regarded as an invalid. However, the Sesemanns' strict housekeeper, Fr√§ulein Rottenmeier, views the household disruptions as wanton misbehavior, and places Heidi under more and more restraint. Soon Heidi is terribly homesick, and grows alarmingly pale. Her one diversion is learning to read and write, motivated by her desire to go home and read to Peter's blind grandmother. Clara's own grandmother visits the children and becomes a friend to Heidi. After becoming very homesick and ill, Heidi returns to her beloved grandfather. Heidi and Clara continue to keep in touch and exchange letters. Clara's doctor recommends that Clara visit Heidi. He feels assured that the fresh mountain air and the wholesome companionship will do her good. While a shy Rottenmeier stays behind after a heart to heart conversation with Clara's grandmother, Clara herself makes the journey again the next season and spends a wonderful summer with Heidi and becomes stronger on goat's milk and fresh mountain air. But one day, Peter, who grows jealous of Heidi and Clara's friendship, pushes Clara's empty wheelchair down the mountain to its destruction. While attempting to bring the wheelchair back to Clara, Heidi is about to drop into a ravine, and Clara, running to save her, without realizing it, starts to walk. Her grandmother and father are amazed and overcome with joy to see Clara walking and the doctor promises to provide permanent care for Heidi, if there comes a time when her grandfather's no longer able to do so. The film eventually ends with a still of Heidi playing ball with her friends.

Tianjin once had a standard steel-wheeled tramway network. But the original tram service was completely stopped in 1973. In 2006, tram service returned to Tianjin in the form of the TEDA Modern Guided Rail Tram. History First tram of Tianjin Tianjin was the first city to have its own citywide tram system (operated by Municipal Corporation) in China. It was the second electric tramway of Mainland China, third if the at the time British colonized Hong Kong was counted and is one of the oldest tram networks in Asia. It was built by Belgian interests during the foreign concession period in 1901, and recognized by the Chinese authorities in 1904. Electric trams were put in place on 16 February 1906. The first line was 5.16 km long and single track and was double tracked in 1907. A second line opened in 1908. Routes were gradually added, reaching five lines by 1918 and peaking in 1946 with eight lines. Buses were introduced by the municipality in 1932. But from the mid 1950s, traffic congestion on the tram network grew rapidly with the increasing number of private cars. From 1964 to 1973, Tianjin gradually demolished all its tram lines. Timeline * 1906 - Electric tram started running from 16 January. * 1933 - Tram service expanded to 14.4 km. * 1972 - The last tram ran. * 2006 - Tram returned as modern rubber tired system in TEDA area of Tianjin. Tram routes Beside electric trams, a horse tramway was also constructed, which connected the city with a large arsenal to the east. Fleet When first tram opened, all stocks were open type. There were only minimal roof, mostly top opened. Around 1930, newer stocks arrived. Windows added, and a more closed trailer was introduced especially in the peak hours.

The line is part of the Line 1 of Trans- European Transport Networks (TEN-T). It is considered a \\"fundamental\\" line by the state railways Ferrovie dello Stato (FS). The railway infrastructure is controlled and managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana a subsidiary of FS. After being single track for most of its length for almost all of its history, in recent years it has been progressively duplicated; this was completed on 26 July 2009 with the opening of the second track between the crossover at P.C. Ostiglia Nord and Poggio Rusco station. History=Planning and construction from Bologna to Poggio Rusco  The railway line was designed in the late 1870s century as the main line between Verona and Bologna to replace the line via Mantua and Modena completed in 1875. The project was listed as a third-class railway in the Baccarini Law of 1879.Law for the construction of new lines and the completion of the united rail network of 29 July 1879, no 5002, named after Alfredo Baccarini (1826‚Äì1890), Minister for Public Works (1878‚Äì1883) The railway was built by the Societ√† per le Strade Ferrate Meridionali (Italian Company for the Southern Railways, SFM) on behalf of the government, while the provinces that it crossed contributed 20 per cent of the construction costs. Originally it was intended that the railway would be built entirely of double track and it was built as such between Tavernelle d'Emilia and Bologna. Difficulties in the construction of the embankment near San Felice sul Panaro and the presence of numerous aquifers along the way which made the terrain over which the line had to pass unstable caused its continuation to be built as a single track. The line was opened from Bologna to San Giovanni in Persiceto on 7 April 1887 and extended to Crevalcore on 9 June 1888 and San Felice on 22 October 1889. During those same years, the trunk line between San Felice and Verona Porta Nuova station was the subject of bitter controversy. The original project designed by the engineers Minarelli and Jean Louis Protche and approved by the legislature, was routed through Poggio Rusco. However the town of Mirandola supported a variation proposed by the engineer Gabelli that diverted the line closer to the town of Modena. Protche and Minarelli's route was finally confirmed in May 1887. As a result, the Suzzara‚ÄìFerrara railway company started construction only a few weeks later of a variation of the project that allowed it to join the Verona- Bologna line at a future station in the town of Poggio Rusco. The station was so constructed and opened on 1 July 1888 even before the concession for the line from San Felice was granted. Following the financial crisis of the 1890s work proceeded slowly and Poggio Rusco was reached on 20 January 1902. The new trunk was operated from its opening with electric traction, using accumulator railcars. Indeed, from 1 May 1901 the SFM began to operate this type of traction between San Felice and Bologna, extending to the new concession when it was opened for operation. Four rail cars were constructed by Diatto with two Ganz 30 kW electric motors, and with 52 seats. They were numbered RA 001-004 and could reach speeds of 60 km/h. The trial ended in 1903. Construction from Poggio Rusco to Verona The line between Nogara and Bologna about 1912 In 1905 the line passed into the control of Ferrovie dello Stato. The building continued to be slow: Revere Scalo was reached on 23 July 1909, while the bridge over the Po river and the Ostiglia Station were opened on 26 November 1911. On 1 October 1912, the line was opened to a new station in Nogara, which already had an existing station on the Mantua‚ÄìMonselice railway. The two stations were connected by a chord, known as Cerea junction‚ÄìNogara junction and both operated until the Mantua‚ÄìMonselice was deviated to run through the Verona‚ÄìBologna line station. On 31 May 1914 the line was opened from Nogara to Isola della Scala, where the new line connected with the Verona‚ÄìRovigo line. In this case, the new station replaced the old station on the other line, as on the same day a deviation of the Verona‚ÄìRovigo line was opened. The 1 February 1924 the line was opened between Isola della Scala and Saint Lucia junction, where it separates from the Verona‚ÄìMantua railway. The Verona‚ÄìBologna line was finally completed after more than forty years of work. Duplication In the 1970s the rail node at Verona was completely restructured, with the opening of San Massimo junction, the displacement of Saint Lucia junction west of its old location and the duplication of the Verona‚ÄìBologna from the new Saint Lucia junction south to the former Verona Ca' di David station. Work on the doubling from Ca di David to Tavernelle d'Emilia only started at the beginning of the 1990s. After years of discussions and proposals, the first worksites were opened at Tavernelle, Ostiglia and Buttapietra. The approved project included a two-track deviation for much of the route. Because of the bankruptcy of the construction firms involved, no work was carried out for several years. The first duplicated section opened between Ca 'di David and Nogara in 2001. On 7 January 2005 an accident at Bolognina railway station between a freight and a passenger train killed 17 people: this led to the banning of freight trains on the route until December 2008 and the acceleration of work.

Features The Verona‚ÄìBologna railway is a double track line with both lines equipped with bi-directional signaling. It is laid with rail on prestressed concrete sleepers. Both tracks are electrified at 3,000 volts DC; electrification of the original single track line was completed in 1941. The Verona‚ÄìBologna line is the first line in Italy to be operated under the new Italian high capacity (Italian: \\"alta capacit√†\\") system, thanks to the duplication work; this project is intended to reduce journey times for both passenger and freight trains. Route The railway passes through the provinces of Verona, Mantua, Modena and Bologna. Starting from Verona Porta Nuova station, where it connects with the line from Innsbruck and the Milan‚ÄìVenice line. The railway runs along the double track that leads to Saint Lucia Junction /P.C., formerly just called Saint Lucia Junction. At this point it crosses several different lines: *a line from San Massimo Junction /P.C. that connects the Brenner line to the Verona‚ÄìBologna line, bypassing Verona station; *a line from Fenilone Junction /P.C. that allows trains from the Milan‚ÄìVenice line to avoid the Verona node and access the Quadrante Europa intermodal yard; *a line from Verona Porta Nuova marshalling yard; *a line to Mantua and Modena (the Verona‚ÄìMantua‚ÄìModena line). After Saint Lucia junction, the railway runs through a long straight section that leads to the town of Isola della Scala. Along this stretch are the station of Buttapietra and the old station of Verona Ca di David. The latter has been closed and during the duplication of the line it was turned into a crossover, where trains can change tracks as required. At station of Isola della Scala occurs at the intersection with the Verona‚ÄìRovigo line, which since 1985 has only run towards Cerea, while the section towards Dossobuono has been abandoned and partially dismantled. The railway then continues through the centres of Nogara‚Äîwhere it intersects with the Mantua‚ÄìMonselice railway, Ostiglia and Poggio Rusco. On the section where the line crosses the Po river the new route deviates significantly from the old one. The town of Revere, on the south bank of the Po formerly had both a railway station and a marshalling yard called Revere Scalo. The new route, however, has eliminated the curve at Revere, removing the railway for both the station and yard. The old Ostiglia station was formerly the location of a junction with the former line to Legnago and Treviso, which was destroyed by allied bombing during World War II. The old Ostiglia station has been replaced by a new station, while that of Revere has been abandoned. The old line between Revere Scalo yard and the Poggio Rusco station remain active. Poggio Rusco is at the junction with the Suzzara‚ÄìFerrara railway, part of the Ferrovie Emilia Romagna (Emilia Romagna Railways, FER), a company owned by the Emilia Romagna regional government. The line continues to San Felice sul Panaro, turning to serve the town of Mirandola, served by a slightly relocated station, which uses the old station buildings. The line then runs directly to Crevalcore station. On this section is the Camposanto station near the bridge over the Panaro river, which was reopened with the duplication. On the same section is the former Bolognina station, which was closed when the railway was duplicated. Crevalcore was the site of the former junction with the disused Ferrara-Modena railway managed by the Societ√† Veneta (\\"Veneta Company\\"). After Crevalcore, the railway turns to the south-east and runs parallel to that of Highway 568 via San Giovanni in Persiceto and Tavernelle d'Emilia. A branch of the former Ferrara‚ÄìModena railway branched off at San Giovanni in Persiceto station to Decima, but was destroyed by bombing during World War II. Shortly before Tavernelle, where a passing loop (Italian: Posto di movimento) has recently years been built, the new line passes over a viaduct on which there is a new station at Osteria Nuova. After Tavernelle, the line continues straight towards Santa Viola station. Along this stretch, a connection to the Bologna ring railway branches off at Tavernelle junction. The latter line used to pass over the Verona‚ÄìBologna line shortly further south: during the extension of Bologna Airport‚Äôs runway in 2004, the ring line was lowered to pass under the runway and now also runs under the Verona‚ÄìBologna line. Just north of the flyover, there is a station at Calderara‚ÄìBargellino, which opened on 15 September 2008. Just before Santa Viola the line begins to run beside the double line formed by the Porrettana railway from Pistoia and the traditional line from Milan, while the high-speed line from Milan connects to the Verona-Bologna line. Both lines then run to Bologna Centrale Station where they connect with the lines to Florence (high-speed and traditional), Ancona and Padua. Operations Regional passenger services are managed by Trenitalia with the collaboration of Ferrovie Emilia Romagna on the section between Poggio Rusco and Bologna. It is also used by all types of Trenitalia long distance trains, including Inter- city and Frecciarossa high-speed trains. Freight traffic is run by several companies.

Soviet TV programming was highly diverse and somewhat similar to that of the BBC or Japanese NHK. Like much of the Soviet media, CT USSR regularly promoted the agendas of the Communist Party. Initially, the service was operated, together with the national radio service, by the Ministry of Culture. Later it was operated by the Gosteleradio committee, under the Communications Ministry and the Information and Press Ministry, and later a Council of Ministers-controlled network of television and radio broadcasting. First decades Early Soviet test card (TIT-0249BIS, –¢–ò–¢-0249–±–∏—Å). Radio was the dominant medium in the former Soviet Union, however, in the 1930s preparations for television were in full swing. On 1 October 1934, the first television sets were made available to the public. The next year, the first television broadcasts began. The Soviet Union television service began full-time experimental test broadcasts on 1 March 1938. Regular public programming began on 9 March 1938 ‚Äì with an evening of programmes, which included news, documentary films and entertainment on Channel 1 in Moscow. At the same time, Channel 5 Leningrad, the national television service from Leningrad and the northern Soviet Union, was launched on 7 July the same year. Programmes were stopped in 1941 at the start of Operation Barbarossa, for fear that the Shabolovka transmitter would be used as an enemy beacon. The same thing happened in Leningrad due to the almost four years siege of the city. The USSR television service began experimental test broadcasts on 7 May 1945 (two days before the German surrender), in preparation for its full reopening. Regular public programming resumed on 7 March 1948. The USSR television service temporarily stopped broadcasts in December 1948 for a major upgrade of the broadcast equipment, but by 1 May the next year, Leningrad and the northern/northwestern USSR resumed television broadcasts for the Palace Square May Day Parade. Regular programming resumed on 16 June 1949, but was now broadcasting in 625 lines ‚Äì a first in the world. On 22 March 1951, Moscow TV was renamed, to avoid confusion by viewers about the forthcoming local channels, becoming the Central Television Station, later known as Programme 1. Leningrad's television service was also renamed into Leningrad Television. It continued its national broadcasts. On 26 August 1952, the Leningrad Television Centre was inaugurated, the USSR's first state-of-the-art television studios. On New Year's Day 1955 the Central Television Station began transmitting daily programming. On 14 February 1956, the new Moscow Programme commenced broadcasting for viewers in Moscow and in the surrounding Moscow Oblast. The USSR television service (both Programme 1 and Moscow Programme 2) began experimental colour broadcast tests on 14 January 1960. The next year, Leningrad Television moved its studios and officers to larger premises. The USSR authorities began construction of a television center in Ostankino in 1963 for the television networks. It was opened in 1967 as part of the celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. Leningrad would soon follow suit the next year as the newly renovated and expanded Leningrad Television Broadcasting Center reopened its doors. On 29 March 1965, Programme Three commenced broadcasting. It was originally an educational channel. This channel was shown only in the major cities in the European USSR (e.g. Moscow and Leningrad), and its programming was co-produced with the USSR Ministry of Education, oriented towards the nation's student population at all levels from pre-school till college.  Expansion  In 1965, CT USSR established a satellite network to expand the television service nationwide. *1965 ‚Äì Experimental broadcast to the Far East via the Molniya system. *1971 ‚Äì Regular broadcasts begin in Siberia, the Far East and central Asia via the Orbita system. *1971 ‚Äì The Vostok satellite begins programmes to viewers in Kazakhstan. *1976 ‚Äì Ekran (Russian: Screen) satellite begins broadcasts. The satellite network for viewers in Soviet Asia (programmes were relayed by transmitter in the European side) was given the name \\"Orbita\\" in the same year. In 1967, the all-new, youth, sport and entertainment network Programme 4 was launched. Programme 3, which was from the beginning available to Moscow only, began broadcasting to the entire USSR via satellite in 1982. Thus, it was renamed All-Union Programme for this purpose and moved to channel 2 in 1977, while Moscow Programme switched to channel 3. Science and technology programming formerly on Programme 4 moved to Programme 6 when that channel was launched on 25 December 1971.

Concerts and musical programs also commemorated these and other national holidays. Since 1971 it was also the official network for the USSR's Pesnya goda All-Union National Soviet Music Festival aired on New Year's Day, also soon becoming a holiday practice for viewers across the nation. Colour Soviet test card used in TV broadcasts in the USSR after the introduction of colour (Ueit, –£–≠–ò–¢). Test colour broadcasting started in Moscow as early as January 1960 using OSKM system (625 lines version of NTSC), but lasted only a few months. This system was rejected. Only circa 4,000 TV sets were built for this system (Raduga, Temp 22, Izumrud 201/203). Colour television was introduced on 1 October 1967, making the Soviet Union the fourth country in Europe to switch to colour broadcast, after the United Kingdom's BBC2, West Germany's ARD and ZDF, and France's ORTF.(see Timeline of the introduction of color television in countries), again ready for the celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution on 7 November 1967. Moscow Programme and Leningrad Television were the first colour broadcasters, even through the 7 November 1967 parade was broadcast in monochrome in the main national channels and Programme 4. CT USSR chose the French S√âCAM colour standard, which would later be adopted across the Eastern Bloc (Romania and Yugoslavia, however, settled for the PAL standard). By 1976, full colour broadcasts began throughout the entire Soviet Union using the SECAM format on all television programs broadcast on all the national channels: Programme One, Programme Two, Moscow Programme, Programme Four and Programme Five ‚Äì Leningrad Television, and in all the republican networks. Olympic Games The hosting of the 1980 Summer Olympics by Moscow was a source of pride for the Eastern Bloc. However, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 had caused outrage in the west, leading to a boycott of the games by 64 western-aligned nations. CT USSR, as the host nation broadcaster, presented a colour broadcast of the Games to the world, and in Soviet territory the Games were broadcast on the two main channels with additional coverage on Program 3, Program 4 and Leningrad Television as well as the republican channels in Belarus, Ukraine (football) and Estonia (sailing). The other republican stations also simulcast and highlighted the entire event. Gorizont In 1988, the USSR-built Gorizont satellite was launched, providing television programming to much of Europe and northern Africa, and even eastern parts of the Americas. The programmes of all the Eastern European socialist republics, including the CT USSR channels, were broadcast on the satellite. The reforms Significant changes to CT USSR were made in the 1980s as the USSR underwent economic and popular political changes brought about by the reforms in Moscow under Mikhail Gorbachev. At first, CT USSR stuck to the party line and barely reported the opposition to the communist regime. However, after the rule of the CPSU began to break down in 1990, CT USSR reformed their programmes to remove propaganda and to report news freely. By the time the Glasnost came into effect, the main news programme on the then Programme 1 (Vremya) was being produced without censorship or interference, and so it covered the events in full. In recognition of its reliable coverage, the programme was re-broadcast on several TV channels around the world (such as Australia's SBS and the United Kingdom's Sky News). CT USSR, at the same time, started a number of new programme strands and formats, including talk shows. On 4 March 1988, emphasizing the Glasnost campaign, Programme 3 and Programme 4, plus Leningrad Television began to be carried across the Soviet territory via satellite. Private TV channels such as ATV and 2√ó2 were also introduced ending the state monopoly on television broadcasting. By 1990, CTV-USSR debuted its first joint international partnership program with the American Broadcasting Company, entitled Capital to Capital. Dissolution of the USSR Upon the total dissolution of the country on 25 December 1991, Soviet Central Television (by now part of the All-Union National Radio and Television Broadcasting Corporation due to a 1990 reform) ceased to be the state broadcaster of the former USSR. On 27 December 1991, Ostankino Television 1 and Ostankino Television 4 (presently Channel One (Russia) and NTV (Russia)) took over the frequencies of Programme 1 and Programme 4. Leningrad Television 5 soon became St. Petersburg State Television Network, broadcasting to all of Russia until 1997. Employees of CT USSR were worried about job prospects in the new broadcaster and also had a loyalty to Soviet Central Television. Viewers accustomed to the Russian programming, were concerned at the loss of favourite shows. (Some of the Soviet Central Television shows are now consigned to Channel One Russia and Russia 1) Additionally the three big Russian channels ‚Äì Channel One, Russia 1 and Petersburg ‚Äì Channel 5 ‚Äì have a good amount of presence in the former Soviet territory, and most of the republican stations are now fully independent. Former television stations Soviet Central Television had three and later six national television channels over its history. The six channels were joined by a number of regional television stations operated by the republican governments of each of the 14 other republics, city television stations operated by the city governments in several key cities and television stations of the governments of the autonomous republics of the Union. Today, these stations, now independent, maintain separate national identities and programming.  National stations  * Programme One ‚Äì was formed in 1938, and began to broadcast a regular daily schedule in 1955. This was the main channel in the former Soviet Union and was a crucial tool for the dissemination of propaganda by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Its output included general entertainment, documentaries and news. *Programme Two ‚Äì was created in 1956. (Its name at first was Programme Three.) Its programmes was mostly entertainment, cultural, news and sport programming. This is also called the All-Union Program due to its national reach across the Soviet Union and the fact that even programs of all forms from the various Union republics were also broadcast here. In 1991 this channel became Russia-1. *Moscow Programme ‚Äì was created in 1965, the second channel to be launched. Its programming was somewhat similar to Program One, but was more flavored at the Moscow City and Oblast citizens. Presently it is TV Centr. *Programme Four ‚Äì was created in 1967‚Äì1968. Its programming was aimed at the intelligentsia and students at all levels. *Leningrad Programme, the national television service from Leningrad (St. Petersburg) and the northern and northwestern USSR was created in 1938, four months after the birth of television in the Soviet Union. Programmes from Leningrad City and Oblast were aired here, plus occasionally those from the USSR's Baltic republics (the republics also had their share on Program 2, the All-Union Program). Until 1988 select Moscow Programme productions were aired. *Technical Programme ‚Äì opened in 1971, was the channel for broadcasts of scientific and technological programming, until 1980 assigned as an emergency channel for civil defense measures during wartime. At first it was offered in Moscow and several other cities. Today, Programme 6 is the sports channel Match TV.  Regional stations  *Baltic Programme was created in 1954 in Riga as the television bureau of CT-USSR for viewers in the Baltic, with additional stations later created in Tallinn (1955) and Vilnius (1957). In 1957 the channel was split into three stations: Riga Television, Vilnius Television and Tallinn Television for viewers in each of the three republics. Today, these stations are the independent Latvijas Televƒ´zija, Eesti Televisioon and LRT televizija. (Tallinn Television had already adopted the Eesti Televisioon brand in 1965.) *Tajik Programme ‚Äì was created in 1960, construction of radio relay lines (RLL technical stations) was started. According to statistics, in 1962 there were 29,000 TVs in Dushanbe and the surrounding areas. At the end of 1962, the Dushanbe-Kulob radio relay line was put into operation, television transmitters were built in Qurghonteppa and Toshrabot, allowing the residents of Kulob and Vakhsh Valley to watch television in Tajikistan. *Belarusian Programme ‚Äì was created in 1956 to serve viewers in Belarus, offering both national and local programming. Appearances= Identity  There were three idents which were broadcast each day on CT USSR. *Startup ident: The blue background with CT USSR's logo (see below) appearing, first the red star (with one point extended) with the phrase TB CCCP (TV USSR), followed by the rings and the caption changing to the channel's name.

Clocks There was only one clock broadcast.  Test card  The UEIT test card was used. Colour TV standard When colour television was introduced in 1967, the S√âCAM system was chosen. Following the collapse of the USSR, some of its former republics switched to the PAL colour system. Finance Broadcasting in the USSR was heavily subsidized by the state. Advertising Advertising ‚Äì in the form of \\"commercial\\" magazine programmes ‚Äì appeared on Soviet television from the 1980s. However, the command economy had little or no competition between brands, so advertising was limited to informing viewers of the prices and availability of products. With perestroika, spot advertising was introduced to CT USSR in order to better cover the system's cost. In popular culture The satirical TV series Second City Television did a 1980 episode consisting of skits centered around a Russian satellite signal overriding the SCTV satellite and causing Russian TV to be broadcast on SCTV's signal, with Soviet Central Television satirized as 'CCCP1' (Three CP One) and 'CCCP2' ('Three CP Two') and containing further satires of Russian programing with shows like Tibor's Tractor (a farmer has a tractor that is the reincarnation of Nikita Khrushchev, spoofing My Mother The Car), Hey Georgy (a man wanders around Russia helping everybody), and a daytime show, Today is Moscow. The episode is featured on SCTV DVD Volume 2.

She was known for translating books on philosophy. She worked as a medical doctor in the Department of Psychiatry at Tokyo University following World War II. She was said to have greatly helped the Ministry of Education and the General Headquarters, where the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers stayed, in her role as an English-speaking secretary, and served as an adviser to Empress Michiko. She wrote many books as a highly educated, multi-lingual person; one of her books, titled On the Meaning of Life (Ikigai Ni Tsuite in Japanese), based on her experiences with leprosy patients, attracted many readers. Life=Childhood Mieko Kamiya was born as the second child and the first daughter of five children of Tamon Maeda and Fusako Maeda. Tamon, a son of an Osaka merchant, was the prewar Japanese ambassador to the International Labour Organization and postwar Minister of Education. He became a Christian under the influence of Kanzo Uchimura. Fusako, a daughter of a raw silk trader in Gunma, received a scholarship for the five years at the girls' high school of Friends School (Japan) in Tokyo that had been established by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). Fusako had an English and Christian education there. Fusako was introduced to Tamon by Inazo Nitobe and was married to him in 1910.\\"„ÄéÈÅçÊ≠¥„Äè Henreki (\\"My Journey\\" in Japanese)\\", Mieko Kamiya, 2005, p.53-56, The family moved to Nagasaki and in 1920, Tamon became a deputy mayor of Tokyo. In 1921 he was appointed the Japanese representative to the International Labour Organization (ILO) at Geneva, Switzerland, where Inazo Nitobe worked as one of the Under-Secretaries General of the League of Nations. Kamiya had started to study English in the second grade at Sacred Heart School in Tokyo from 1921. The family could speak English when they arrived in Geneva. Kamiya was educated at the Jean-Jacques Rousseau Institute (in French: Acad√©mie De Gen√®ve or Institut Jean-Jacques Rousseau), when Jean Piaget, a developmental psychologist and philosopher known for his epistemological studies with children, was the principal. From 1932, she studied at the junior high school of the International School of Geneva (in French: Ecole Internationale de Gen√®ve). She later wrote that in reading and writing, French was most easy. In 1926, the family returned to Tokyo. Kamiya entered the Juyu Gakuen, but changed her school within a few months to the Girls' High School of Seijo Gakuen (it now has a higher education department; Seijo University).\\"„ÄéÈÅçÊ≠¥„Äè Henreki (\\"My Journey\\" in Japanese)\\", Mieko Kamiya, 2005, p.7-74, Higher education In 1932, Kamiya entered the Tsuda College. In 1934, she happened to visit Tama Zenshoen Sanatorium as an organist accompanying a missionary. She was deeply impressed with leprosy patients there and felt that she should someday work for them. At that time, leprosy was an incurable disease, and all the people around her were against her becoming a physician. In 1935, she entered the College of the same school. She contracted tuberculosis, and while she was under treatment for the disease, she studied by herself classical literature in many languages, including Italian, French, German, and Greek. Her favorite was Marcus Aurelius's book which she translated into Japanese later. Her tuberculosis cleared with pneumothorax therapy. In 1938, in view of the worsening US-Japan relations, Japan set up a Japan Culture Center in New York, and her father, who was one of the editorial writers of the Newspaper Asahi Shimbun, was appointed as its head and the family moved to New York, except her elder brother, Yoichi Maeda, who lived in Paris. Kamiya began to study Greek literature at the Graduate School of Columbia University and lived with her family in Scarsdale, New York. After her health condition improved, Kamiya studied at Bryn Mawr College from February to the end of June 1939. She met Masa Uraguchi, who was a graduate student of botany at Philadelphia University and who became her lifetime best friend. She also met Wilhelm Sollmann, who was a German journalist, politician, and Interior Minister of the Weimar Republic. Kamiya had a close relationship with Mr. and Mrs. Sollmann until June 16, 1939. Kamiya also had a close relationship with Caroline C. Graveson, an English psychologist. When Graveson was leaving the United States, she said to Kamiya, \\"I predict your future. You'll be an author after you graduate from three M (Medicine, Marriage and Motherhood).\\"\\"„ÄéÈÅçÊ≠¥„Äè Henreki (\\"My Journey\\" in Japanese)\\", Mieko Kamiya, 2005, p.102-165, p.278-305, p.334-335, Medicine In 1940, Kamiya began to study medicine with the approval of her father, at the premedical course of Columbia University. In fear of the coming war, in 1941, she returned to Japan and entered Tokyo Women's Medical University. Her father returned to Japan after the beginning of the US-Japan war in an exchange ship. In October 1942, she visited Masao Oota or Mokutaro Kinoshita who was an authority on leprosy research at Tokyo University and visited Nagashima Aiseien Sanatorium and spent 12 days there. She met Kensuke Mitsuda and other staff and reconfirmed her interest in leprosy patients. In the fall of 1944, she graduated from the medical school and entered the department of psychiatry of Tokyo University She was interested in psychiatry because one of her friends developed schizophrenia. In May 1945, her house burned down and she had to stay in the University treating patients. After the war After Japan's defeat in World War II, her father was appointed Minister of Education, and Kamiya was asked to become a secretary. She could speak fluent English and translated many papers. Her work continued after her father resigned in January 1946. In May, she returned to Tokyo University and helped to examine Sh≈´mei ≈åkawa who was a prisoner of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. In May 1946, she married Noburoh Kamiya, an instructor in botanical research at Tokyo University. In 1949, he was appointed Professor at Osaka University and their family moved to Osaka. She translated Marcus Aurelius Antoninus's book, which was published. Her husband was invited to teach at the University of Pennsylvania where he had studied, but she and their two children remained in Osaka. She earned money for living expenses for their children, who had contracted tuberculosis, by teaching French. In 1951, her family moved to Ashiya. In 1957, she started her studies in psychiatry at Nagashima Aiseien Sanatorium. She earned her Ph.D. in 1960. In the same year, she became a professor at Kobe College and in 1963, also a professor at her alma mater Tsuda College. She taught not only psychiatry but also French literature. In 1965, she became chief psychiatrist at Nagashima Aiseien Sanatorium. Her unique studies included a visit to Virginia Woolf's husband and also to Michel Foucault in 1966. She published a book, \\"On the Meaning of Life (\\"Ikigai Ni Tsuite\\")\\".\\"„ÄéÁîü„Åç„Åå„ÅÑ„Å´„Å§„ÅÑ„Å¶„Äè (\\"On the Meaning of Life\\" in Japanese)\\", Mieko Kamiya, Misuzu Shobo, 1980, Death Kamiya died on October 12, 1979, from heart disease at age 65.\\"„ÄéÈÅçÊ≠¥„Äè Henreki (\\"My Journey\\" in Japanese)\\", Mieko Kamiya, 2005, p.347, On the Meaning of Life (Ikigai) Kamiya's best known work is described in the Japanese Wikipedia article, On the meaning of life (ikigai).„ÄéÁîü„Åç„Åå„ÅÑ„Å´„Å§„ÅÑ„Å¶„Äè „Åø„Åô„ÅöÊõ∏Êàø„ÄÅ1980Âπ¥„ÄÇ According to Mieko Kamiya, the Japanese word \\"Ikigai\\" means two things: the object itself and the feeling of the one who feels Ikigai. The latter may also be called Ikigai-kan (Ikigai feeling). When a person considers what their Ikigai is, they are likely to consider the following questions. # What is my existence for? Is it for someone? # What is the purpose of my existence? If there is any, am I faithful to it? Ikigai may be felt most when what a person wants to do is also their duty, when the answers to questions 1 and 2 are the same. However, there are people whose Ikigai differs from what they do to make a living. In trying to forcibly match these, they may become nervous, may develop reactive depression, or even commit suicide. Kamiya stated that those who have firm Ikigai would be those who realize their own mission, or purpose in life, and who are deliberately progressing toward their goals. They are usually not distinguished persons; they may be teachers at secondary schools, or those engaged in special education, or those working in hospitals in remote areas. If they are too busy or are otherwise unable to be faithful to what they should be, this spoils their Ikigai most. What is important is pursuing their purpose, not whether or not they accomplish their goal. They will be satisfied even if they die if they are on the road to the accomplishments; but if they are not faithful, they cannot die satisfied. According to Kamiya, when a person discovers a new theme for their existence, this theme should be in line with their true nature. The decision is very important, and if there is trouble in the decision, neurosis, or a pseudo-way of life, or even suicide may result. A new theme of life may be related to the former one, or may be a totally different one. An example might be the change from love for a human to love for God. This change in the theme of existence may be referred to as replacement of passion. Paul Gauguin may be cited as someone who experienced this, as he started his career as a stockbroker, but went into drawing art at the age of 35. According to Kamiya, the fundamental role of religion is to give a person unified standards of value, or Ikigai (meaning of life).

He studied at the Institute for Electrical Science as well as the Faculty of Applicable Arts in Baghdad, both of which he quit early to dedicate himself to cinema. For a while he worked as freelance writer, writing essays and film reviews in Baghdad. In 1998 he began to study film at the Faculty of Fine Arts, however, he soon quit his film studies due to the propagandistic nature of the school as well as the low standards of quality. Afterward and until the American invasion he wrote and directed numerous short films and was part of the artistic collective known as Najeen (the survivors). After the invasion he began making feature films.  Underexposure  Oday Rasheed's first feature film, a docufiction called Underexposure (2005), was shot on expired Kodak film that was bought back from looters in the early days of the American occupation. Underexposure was produced by Enlil Film and Arts, with Production Designer Majed Rasheed and Executive Producer Furat Al Jamil. Filming began in November 2003 with money that the crew raised by selling their own possessions. Underexposure was the first movie to be filmed in Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein and the first Iraqi film in over a decade to not be censored by the Baath party. Filming was finished in April 2004 and Underexposure was released in June 2005 after post-production was completed in Berlin, Germany, with co-producers Tom Tykwer and Maria Kopf of X Filme Creative Pool. Underexposure was shown in film festivals around the world, including The Rotterdam International Film Festival (Netherlands 2005, World Premiere), the Febio Festival (Czech Republic 2005), Arab Film Festival Japan (2005), Singapore International Film Festival (2005), Arab Film Festival (Netherlands 2005), Durban International Film Festival (South Africa 2005), Munich Film Festival (Germany 2005), Osians Cinefan Asian Film Festival (India 2005), Alexandria International Film Festival (Egypt 2005), La Mostra de Valencia (Spain 2005). Additionally, Rasheed received numerous awards for his work on Underexposure, including Best Film in the Singapore International Film Festival in 2005.  Qarantina  In 2009 Rasheed finished filming his second feature film, Qarantina, which was scheduled to be shown in 2009 and 2010 at the Dubai International Film Festival and the Rotterdam Film Festival - however, due to complications in the post-production, neither of these showings occurred. It is now complete and scheduled for its world premiere at the Abu Dhabi Film Festival on 17 October 2010 and European premiere at the International Film Festival in Rotterdam. Qarantina was one of 37 projects in 2009 to be selected for financing from the Hubert Bals Fund in the Netherlands. Qarantina examines the realities of postwar Iraq through the unlikely interactions of killer and a family that make their residence in an abandoned building. The assassin watches coldly as the family struggles with an abusive father and unmarried pregnant daughter. Then begins to kill targets that are not contracted, displeasing his clients. In the end, the fates of the characters are determined by their individual interactions and decisions. From the Qarantina page on Facebook: Iraq is in Qarantina - people placed in Qarantina - our souls are in Qarantina. \\"Qarantina = Quarantine is voluntary or compulsory isolation, typically to contain the spread of something considered dangerous.(Wikipedia)\\"  Baghdadwood: The Iraqi Independent Film Production Center  Oday Rasheed has been particularly concerned about the future of Iraqi cinema and the lack of opportunities available to young filmmakers in his country. As a result, he has been engaged in workshops for young filmmakers and the development of a modern independent film production center. Helping him in the major project is Iraq's only other prominent film director, Mohamed Al-Daradji. The two have secured a building rent-free for three years from the Ministry of Culture, provided they do the necessary renovations. In Rasheed's words, \\"We made it. And film life, you make it once and you made it. Forever. So, actually, we don't need this. The idea is to help those guys who sit in Iraq dreaming up films, but they don't know how to do it.\\"  Filmography  As Director: *1997 Mud Whiteness (experimental short film, video) *1998 Another Introduction (experimental short film, video) *1999 The Introduction (short film, video) *2002 Gilgamesh: The Epic...

Photo taken by Vosh72 Manuel Carrillo Tablas (1822 - December 31, 1899) was a Mexican philanthropist and served as mayor of Orizaba, Veracruz, Mexico. He was a descendant from the Carrillo family, a Spanish noble house. He served as the mayor several times (1866‚Äì1867, 1871-1871, 1877-1877, 1892‚Äì1894, and 1899‚Äì1900).Hernandez Guzman, D.: Diccionario Enciclop√©dico de la regi√≥n de Orizaba 2¬™ Edici√≥n corregida y aumentada, MX30118AMO. Archivo General de la Naci√≥n, April 23, 2005. Early life Don Manuel Carrillo Tablas was born into one of the Grandes families of Spain. He was born Cuba en route to Mexico, but was registered as born in Cordoba to Don Jos√© Manuel Carrillo de Albornoz and Do√±a Mar√≠a In√©s Tablas who traveled from Spain through Cuba to New Spain (Mexico). In 1859 he married the daughter of Don Leandro Iturriaga and Do√±a Altagracia Gambino, Rosa Iturriaga Gambino from Orizaba, Veracruz, Mexico where he would establish a new dynasty and make his own fortune. Career Don Manuel Carrillo Tablas managed to acquire more than half the properties in the city of Orizaba, Veracruz. He had two ranches (Palas y San Isidro en Ixhuatlancillo) both which extended from the borders of the city (Cerritos) to the base of the Pico de Orizaba. He also had lands in C√≥rdoba and Puebla. He was also a very charitable man. During his life he funded in large measure the building and transportation of the famous Palacio de Hierro (Iron Palace) designed by Societ√© Anonym√© des Forges D¬¥Aiseau, B√©lgica (Belgium) and which served as City Hall for most of the 20th century. The initial loan he made to the city for the project (60 thousand pesos in silver - the equivalent of 180,000 U.S. Dollars at the time) was never repaid due to his untimely death at the turn of the century; neither was the loan he made to transport the palace from the shipyard to its present location. He also donated the Casa de la Manzana de Bendri√±ana to extend \\"Parque Castillo\\" and the land for the main market \\"Mercado Melchor Ocampo.\\".G√ºere√±a, Jos√© Romero.: El Sol de Orizaba, 2 de marzo de 2008.Goch√≠coa Gomez, Ing. Alberto.: Las Cr√≥nicas de Orizaba...En Pocas Palabras, Editorial Robles: Av. Cuauht√©moc # 1608 Veracruz, M√©xico. 2009. Don Manuel helped to contribute to Orizaba's recognition as a major city in the Province. When Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico and Empress Carlota visited the city for the first time in 1864 under much pomp, the emperor and empress stayed in the house of Don Manuel Carrillo Tablas known as \\"La Estrella\\" and later as \\"La Eureka.\\" He had another mansion where Don Francisco Y Madero stayed as a guest as well.Goch√≠coa Gomez, Ing. Alberto.: Las Cr√≥nicas de Orizaba...En Pocas Palabras, Editorial Robles: Av. Cuauht√©moc # 1608 Veracruz, M√©xico. 2009. After the fall of the second Mexican Empire, Don Manuel was present when the Mexican Republic was reestablished in Orizaba. He then sought to make Orizaba a city of culture and progress both as Mayor and as a prominent resident. In 1892 Orizaba boasted being the city that housed 10 of the countries 665 newspapers. During the time of the Presidency of Porfirio Diaz, Orizaba was considered the most educated city in the Mexican Province. Death On New Year's Eve 1899 Don Manuel Carrillo Tablas died. His son Don Manuel Carrillo Iturriaga (born in 1868 and who would served as Political Chief of the Canton of Orizaba during the early 1900s), would take up the helm as the head of the family. Don Manuel Carrillo Iturriaga married Do√±a Mar√≠a Lim√≥n (from San Luis Potos√≠) and both lived in Orizaba, Veracruz.Wilkie, James W.: Contemporary Mexico: Papers of the IV International Congress of Mexican History, page 191. University of California Press, 1976. Don Manuel Carrillo Iturriaga would also serve in the Mexican Congress as a Diputado during the rewriting of the Mexican Constitution in 1917.Valdez, JOAQUIN Z.: Legislatura XXVII - A√±o I - Per√≠odo Extraordinario - Fecha 19170620 - N√∫mero de Diario 62. 1917. Because Don Manuel died without a will, the government of Mexico seized much of his possessions, leaving his children to battle the courts to retain what they could of their father's vast wealth. At the time of Don Manuel Carrillo Tablas' death, families of status and wealth were buried in private lots on their ranch. Looters disturbed the remains of Don Manuel searching for jewels and left Don Manuel's remains unearthed. His son, Don Manuel Carrillo Iturriaga, brought the remains to his family's Hacienda known as \\"El Molino de la Alianza.\\" Upon the death of Don Manuel Carrillo Iturriaga, his daughter Do√±a Guadalupe Carrillo viuda de Ortega buried both her father and grandfather in the city's cemetery, in the family plot. The renowned musician and Maestro Armando Ortega is also buried in the same family plot.

Film career Born in Kyoto, Nagata attended the ≈åkura K≈çt≈ç Sh≈çgy≈ç Gakk≈ç (now Tokyo Keizai University), but left before graduating. He joined the Nikkatsu studio in 1925 and, after working as a location manager, rose to become head of production at the Kyoto studio. Experiencing conflicts with the Nikkatsu president, he left the company in 1934, taking many Nikkatsu stars with him, to form Daiichi Eiga. While short-lived, that studio created such masterpieces as Kenji Mizoguchi's Sisters of the Gion (1936) and Osaka Elegy (1936). When Daiichi Eiga folded, Nagata became head of the Kyoto studio of Shink≈ç Kinema until the government reorganized the industry during World War Two. Against a government plan to combine the fiction film companies into two studios, Nagata fought hard for the alternative option of creating a third studio. His efforts resulted in the creation of the Daiei Motion Picture Company, where he first served as an executive. He rose to become president in 1947 and, apart from a brief period when he was purged by Occupation authorities, remained in that position until 1971. Under his reign, Daiei produced Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950) and entered it in the Venice Film Festival, where it won the grand prize and became the first Japanese film to win an international award, thus introducing Japanese cinema to the world. Nagata also spurred the production of Teinosuke Kinugasa's Gate of Hell (1953), the first Japanese color film to be shown abroad, earning both an honorary Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Nagata also produced such renowned films as Mizoguchi's Ugetsu (1953) and Sansho the Bailiff (1954), as well as Jokyo (which was entered into the 10th Berlin International Film Festival). On the popular front, Nagata's Daiei was also known for such successful film series as the Zatoichi films starring Shintaro Katsu, the Sleepy Eyes of Death series featuring Raiz≈ç Ichikawa, and the Gamera movies. Due to the decline of the film industry, and Nagata's extravagant expenditures, Daiei went bankrupt in 1971, but he continued as an independent producer for some years after that. He produced more than 160 films during his career. Baseball During the age when many Japanese film studios owned professional baseball teams, Nagata served as owner first of the Daiei Stars, and then of the Daimai Orions when the Stars merged with the Mainichi Orions in 1958. He promoted the two-league system, helped build Tokyo Stadium, and became the first president of the Pacific League in Japan. He was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 1988.

The radio program had been commissioned by the United States government under the auspices of the Office of Education, and was scheduled for live broadcast on that date well before the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred. When producer Corwin asked on December 7 whether the show was still on, the response wired to him the next day was, \\"The President thinks it's more important now than ever to proceed with the program.\\" Cast The dramatic show was broadcast from New York City, Washington, D.C., and Hollywood, California. The music was composed by Bernard Herrmann. Performers included Edward Arnold, Lionel Barrymore, Bob Burns, Walter Brennan, Walter Huston, Marjorie Main, Edward G.
