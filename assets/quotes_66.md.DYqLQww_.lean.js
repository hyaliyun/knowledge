Flood risk A stream runs alongside the railway line at this point, and it has flooded parts of the depot on several occasions. The flood in January 1994 damaged two cars of Class 483 stock, while in 1998 trains had to be moved away from the depot to prevent damage. In October 2000, the flooding was extensive and not only damaged four Class 483 units but also washed away ballast at nearby Smallbrook, meaning Island Line Trains had to suspend their services for several days.

It is the smallest known snake species. This member of the Leptotyphlopidae family is found on the Caribbean island of Barbados. It has been reported to be on the islands of Antigua and Barbuda. The snake was first identified as a separate species in 2008 by S. Blair Hedges, a herpetologist from Pennsylvania State University.Dunham, Will. Reuters UK (3 August 2008). (See: ¬∂ 5) Hedges named the new species of snake in honor of his wife, Carla Ann Hass, a herpetologist who was part of the discovery team.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Leptotyphlops carlae, p. 48). Specimens already existed in reference collections in the London Natural History Museum and in a museum in California, but they had been incorrectly identified to belong to another species. At the time of publication, August 2008, T. carlae was described as the snake species with the smallest adults in the world. The first scientific specimens taken by the research team were found under rocks in a forest. The snake is thought to be near the lower size limit for snakes, as young snakes need to attain a certain minimum size to find suitable food. Description The size of mother-to- offspring of large species of snakes (left) compared to small species such as L. carlae (right) Tetracheilostoma carlae The average length of Tetracheilostoma carlae adults is approximately 10 cm, (3.94 inches), with the largest specimen found to date measuring 10.4 cm (4.09 inches). The snakes are said by Hedges to be \\"about as wide as a spaghetti noodle. The photograph above shows L. carlae on a quarter dollar, a coin with a diameter of 24.26 mm (0.955 inches). The specimen weighed 0.6 grams.https://mapress.com/zootaxa/2008/f/zt01841p030.pdf T. carlae is thought to feed primarily on a diet of termites and ant larvae. Threadsnakes are oviparous, laying eggs to reproduce. The female of this snake species produces only one large egg at a time. The emerging offspring is about half the length of the mother. Small species of snake such as T. carlae have relatively large new-born offspring compared to adults. The offspring of the largest snakes are only one-tenth the length of an adult, whereas offspring of the smallest snakes typically are one-half the length of an adult (see figure below). The tiny snakes produce only one, massive egg‚Äîrelative to the size of the mother. Conservation status Little is known about the ecology, abundance, or distribution of this species. Essentially, Barbados has no original forest remaining, however, this native species very likely requires a forest habitat for survival since it evolved in the presence of forests. Based on the small number of known specimens and its distribution apparently being restricted to eastern Barbados, the continued survival of the species is a concern.

It was directed by Erich von Stroheim, Raoul Walsh, and Alfred L. Werker, although no directorial credit is given. The film is a re- edited version of von Stroheim's now-lost film Walking Down Broadway. The film stars James Dunn, ZaSu Pitts, Minna Gombell, and Boots Mallory. The story follows the relationship between an innocent, small-town boy and girl who are overmatched by the vastness and crudeness of New York City, but whose love overcomes both their surroundings and their friends' attempts to separate them. The theme of loneliness among singles and the practice of \\"picking up\\" strangers to satisfy sexual longing are also explored. Hello, Sister! was also thought to have been lost, until a print was found in the early 1970s. Title According to the Motion Picture Herald, \\"Hello, Sister!\\" is \\"the salutation of the 'pick-up.'\\" Plot Mona (Minna Gombell) encourages her two friends Millie (ZaSu Pitts) and Peggy (Boots Mallory), both newcomers to the city, to accompany her \\"walking down Broadway\\" to meet men. They encounter two young men on the street and pair off, though not with the ones they prefer. Millie, a homely, eccentric woman who likes to talk about death, immediately casts her eye on Jimmy (James Dunn), a shy Midwesterner, but Jimmy prefers Peggy, a sweet, innocent girl from the South. But Mac, an abrasive New Yorker, takes Peggy for his partner and Jimmy is forced to be with Millie as the group heads off to Coney Island. At the amusements, Mac proves himself to be a boor and Peggy wants to go home, but Millie convinces her to go dancing with them. On the way home, they see a dog hit by a car and Jimmy picks up the injured animal; Peggy offers to help treat it at her apartment. Millie slips and falls into a sewer and is rescued by Jimmy. Back at the rooming house, Peggy settles Millie into a warm bath and joins Jimmy, Mac, and Mona in the latter's apartment. Mac makes a pass at her and she runs back to her room. Jimmy brings her a sandwich and they open up to each other, sharing that neither has any experience in picking up strangers. Peggy invites Jimmy to climb up the roof through a skylight in her room and they continue talking, then kiss. Jimmy leaves very late at night, feeling very much in love. Mac sees him leave and decides that Peggy is free for the taking. He breaks into Peggy's room and tries to rape her but is stopped by Mona, who has heard the commotion from her downstairs apartment. Mona and Mac tussle and brawl all the way back down the stairs. After three months of dating, Jimmy and Peggy decide to rent a house on Long Island if Jimmy can get a raise. Then Peggy discovers she is pregnant and hesitantly informs Jimmy, who is overjoyed and says they must get married right away. Mac and Millie, jealous of the couple's happiness, independently scheme to break them apart. When Jimmy comes late to the marriage-license bureau, missing Peggy, he heads to Peggy's rooming house and meets Mac on the way. Mac tells him that he had been in Peggy's room after Jimmy left that night, and Jimmy punches him. Jimmy then finds Millie in Peggy's apartment and questions her about Peggy's fidelity. Upset that he makes fun of her, Millie tells Jimmy that she and Peggy often pick up men. Jimmy hits Millie as well and goes out to find an agitated Peggy, who is standing in the street in the rain without an umbrella. Jimmy bombards her with accusations of her infidelity and Peggy is angry at him for believing these lies, but doesn't say a word in her defense. She runs back up to her room in tears and locks the door. Distressed to see her friend in such a state, Millie goes out to the street to talk to Jimmy, followed by Mona and Mac. Just then the rooming house erupts in flames. The fire has been caused by dynamite stored in the basement by a drunkard; no one had believed him when he told them what he was doing. Realizing that Peggy is inside and Jimmy must save her, Millie admits that she lied to him out of jealousy. Mac also admits that he lied and Jimmy punches him again. Then Jimmy rushes into the smoke-filled building to save Peggy, but cannot open her door. He climbs up to the roof and jumps in through the skylight to find Peggy collapsed in her bed. He pulls her up to the roof to breathe fresh air and helps her cross over to another rooftop to wait for rescuers. He admits he was consumed with jealousy when he thought she was seeing other men, and says that he wouldn't want to go on living if something happened to her. He asks her to forgive him, and they embrace.

Peterson * Wade Boteler as passerby at apartment * James Flavin as fireman Production history=Development of original film Erich von Stroheim was hired by Fox Films to write and direct a film under the working title of Walking Down Broadway. On September 2, 1931, Fox executive Winfield Sheehan approved the project on several conditions. One was that von Stroheim, who was known for filming excessive footage, would be limited to shooting 85,000 feet of film, or 95 minutes of screen time. The script was based on the unproduced play Walking Down Broadway by Dawn Powell. According to Fox staff writer Leonard Spigelgass, who assisted von Stroheim with the screenplay, the director \\"was chiefly interested in the neuroses\\" of the film's characters, who had been changed from \\"simple American characters into far more complicated ones, Viennese-oriented\\". Producer Sol M. Wurtzel urged von Stroheim to implement Wurtzel's idea of introducing the idea of marriage between the characters at the very beginning of the film to make them more \\"sympathetic\\". The final shooting script was filed on August 9, 1932, with the subtitle \\"An inconsequential story concerning small people along The Great White Way\\". Casting ZaSu Pitts, the star of von Stroheim's silent films Greed (1924) and The Wedding March (1928), was chosen by the director to play the part of Millie. Von Stroheim once called Pitts \\"the greatest psycho-pathological actress in the American cinema\\"; in this film, he envisioned her as the centerpiece of the story, the \\"romantic martyr\\". Von Stroheim originally wanted George Raft to play Mac; the part was ultimately filled by Terrance Ray. Boots Mallory was a newcomer to film, and James Dunn was a Fox contract player who had made his screen debut in the 1931 film Bad Girl. Cinematographer James Wong Howe alleged that von Stroheim physically bruised Mallory when she was too exhausted to cry on cue. Von Stroheim also attached a length of thread to Dunn's pant leg and tugged on it every time he wanted the actor to show more emotion in his scenes. Lobby card Filming Von Stroheim completed the filming of Walking Down Broadway in 48 days from August to October 1932, on a budget of $300,000. Fox executives were pleased with von Stroheim's timeliness and planned to hire him to direct another film. But upon viewing the footage, they balked at the \\"sexual obsessions, neuroses, and other grim aspects of the film\\". According to White, the screening audience was composed of \\"studio lot secretaries\\" and the feedback was that the production was \\"morbid, unpleasant, strange, and unsavory\\". Wurtzel, who was involved in a \\"power struggle\\" at the studio with Sheehan, led the push to re- edit and re-shoot the film. Spigelgass later wrote that Sheehan was the one who fired von Stroheim from the project. Re-editing and re-shooting To protect the studio's reputation, false reports were sent out to industry trade journals blaming the need to cut the film on von Stroheim's penchant for filming excessive footage. A November 1932 article in Variety reported: > [Fox] decided to remake about 50% of the picture. ‚Ä¶ Impossible story plus > miscasting of Zasu Pitts and Boots Mallory are the reasons. ‚Ä¶ James Dunn and > Terrance Ray, other two members of the cast, gave poor performances with the > direction rather than their ability blamed for the result. Writer Edwin Burke was brought in to script new scenes and Burke also directed some retakes, as did directors Alfred L. Werker and Raoul Walsh. Wurtzel assumed responsibility for the re-shooting, which extended from February to March 1933 and cost $62,000. The film was renamed Hello, Sister! and released without a directorial credit. Von Stroheim had no say in the re-editing of the film. After this experience, he left directing and went into acting. Publicity photo of James Dunn and Boots Mallory in the film Comparison between versions The final cut, which clocked in at 61 minutes, bore little resemblance to the original in tone and characterization. The films differ in emphasis in many places, particularly in the characters of Mac and Millie. According to the AFI Catalog of Feature Films, Mac is even more vulgar in Walking Down Broadway, while Millie plays a more important role thematically. Hello, Sister! changed the original characterization of \\"the turtle-petting, hunchback-befriending, blood and pickle-loving Millie\\" into a comedic presence right from the start. The most obvious difference between the films is their endings. In the original, the apartment blaze is caused by Millie trying to kill herself by opening the gas in her oven. The action then switches to her hospital bed, where she encourages Jimmy and Peggy to reunite and then \\"succumbs to an agonizing, terrifying death\\". In the re-edited film, the apartment blaze is caused by dynamite that has been stored in the basement by a drunkard, who also functions as comic relief. Through analysis of the production stills from Walking Down Broadway, film historian William K. Everson has estimated that about 60% of Hello, Sister! comes from von Stroheim's footage, while von Stroheim biographer Richard Koszarski asserts that 75% of the final cut contains von Stroheim's work. Based on the re- shooting script dated February 6, 1933, the American Film Institute determined that the following scenes were shot by von Stroheim: > some shots of the \\"walk down Broadway\\"; Millie's dialogue with Jimmy as they > walk about her fondness for funerals; Jimmy finding the injured dog; Millie > falling in the sewer and Jimmy rescuing her; hallway shots as Jimmy goes to > Peggy's apartment; Jimmy and Peggy climbing up to look out the skylight in > her apartment (however most of the apartment scene is new); Mac's attempted > rape of Peggy and his subsequent fight with Mona; Jimmy's talk with his boss > in the bank; the marriage license bureau scenes; Jimmy and Peggy's argument > in the rain; Peggy's return to the apartment; the fight in the street; the > explosion and the most of the fire sequence. Noting the studio's upheaval of von Stroheim's original intent, film historians have decried Hello, Sister! as \\"an uncredited mediocrity\\", a \\"mutilated, garbled and partially reshot\\" film, and \\"a mongrel artifact\\". Release Hello, Sister! was released on April 14, 1933. It was marketed in England under the title Clipped Wings. The film was a box-office flop. Critical reception Colin Patrick of The Indianapolis Star said the characters, the setting, and Dunn's presence in the film all drew comparisons to Bad Girl (1931), which launched Dunn's film career, \\"but Hello, Sister lacks the simple, human sincerity of that good play\\". He also called the storyline \\"hokum\\", explaining: \\"When they have to have an explosion caused by a habitual drunk with a mania for collecting dynamite to arrive at a climax, you may be sure that the story tellers are running out of ideas\\". Gilbert Kanour of the Baltimore Evening Sun panned the film, writing: \\"Half a dozen actors do the best they can to make 'Hello Sister' something else than a dull torment, but the task is too much for them\\". Mollie Merrick felt the film should win \\"worst picture of the year\\", writing: \\"It cost plenty; was completely remade, launched a new star who is everything but star material, and was just one colossal bore\\". The Film Daily noted that the film is \\"[f]or adults only. Its story is hackneyed and considerably off-color, with dialogue which at times cannot be described as wholesome\\". Harold R. Cohen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette did not even bother reviewing the film upon its 1933 release; referring to the combined cost of the original and re-edited versions, he summed it up as \\"$375,000 worth of pure, unadulterated cinematic garbage\\". Some contemporary reviews endorsed the romantic elements of the film. The Hartford Courant wrote: > Hello Sister is a typical James Dunn picture, full of sweetness and light > and young romance. ‚Ä¶ James Dunn gives his usual ingratiating performance and > Miss Mallory is delightful.

She was known as Gaby Fay early in her career. Biography Holden was born in Birmingham, England. After leaving England in 1929, Holden and her husband moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada for a time. They co-owned The Empress Theatre until 1933, and they created a theatre company, The British Guild Players, that specialized in comedies during the depression era. Eventually they left Vancouver and moved to Hollywood. Holden appeared in 46 motion pictures between 1935 and 1958, and she is best known for her recurring role as Emily Hardy, mother of Mickey Rooney's character in the Andy Hardy film series. The series was enormously popular in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and Holden was in 15 of the 16 Hardy movies, surpassed only by Rooney, who was in all 16. Holden is remembered for her performance as Hazel, the mother of Samson (Victor Mature), in Cecil B. DeMille's Samson and Delilah, in which she utters her character's most notable line: \\"He wants to marry a Philistine!\\" She was married to David Clyde from 1914 until his death in 1945. She died in Los Angeles, California, aged 79, from cancer.

First founded in 1862, the current building designed by Benjamin Backhouse was completed in 1869, making it the oldest Anglican church in Brisbane. For most of its history, it has been identified with the High Church or Anglo-Catholic tradition within Anglicanism. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This single-storeyed stone church, the oldest Anglican Church in Brisbane, was erected in 1861, and rebuilt in 1869, for the Wickham Terrace District Anglican congregation. It is one of the few remaining parish churches in Queensland owned under the colonial provision of private trustees of church property. The Church of England was the first church to be established in Queensland. In 1849 the site for St John's Church on William Street was granted, with the church being consecrated in 1854. The Wickham Terrace land was granted to the Anglican Church in 1856, although the first deed of grant was dated September 1865 and was originally intended as the site for an Anglican cathedral. The Diocese of Brisbane was formed in 1859 with Edward Tufnell as the first Bishop of Brisbane, taking office in 1860, and designating St John's as the pro-cathedral. First All Saints' Church, 1862 The early 1860s growth of Windmill Hill and Spring Hill as residential areas, prompted Bishop Tufnell in 1861 to promote the establishment of an Anglican church on the proposed cathedral site on Wickham Terrace. The original church, a rubble structure, was designed by noted architect Benjamin Backhouse in 1861 and opened on 23 February 1862 by Bishop Tufnell. It was known officially as the Wickham Terrace Episcopalian Church, or the Wickham Terrace District Church, and unofficially as the Tabernacle. Originally intended to be a second church in the same parish as St John's, in 1864 the congregation of the Wickham Terrace Church decided to become independent of St John's, with a parish carved out of St John's parish and extending as far as the present parish of Milton. As the congregation grew in number, the initial Wickham Terrace church became too small and it was decided to extend the building and raise the roof by increasing the height of the existing walls. Architect Richard George Suter, churchwarden, Cambridge graduate and proponent of the Gothic style which dominated Anglican church architecture in Australia, designed the alterations which were carried out in 1869. The original rubble walls could not, however, support the additional weight of the increase and so the old walls were demolished, resulting in an almost entirely new building (the present church) being created. Only the original floor plan, flooring and roof were retained. Plaque commemorating the dedication of the church by Governor Blackall in 1869 The dedication took place on 5 April 1869. The Governor of Queensland, Samuel Blackall, laid the foundation stone, a time capsule was deposited and Bishop Tufnell named the church \\"All Saints\\". The church was increased in length by , wall height was increased by and the roof by . A chancel and vestry were added, and Brisbane tuff was used for the walls. Provision was made for a baptistery or large western porch to be added, but this was not carried out. The church was constructed by George Ely, stonemason of Spring Hill, and was completed at a cost of , excluding architect's fees. left The present church, the oldest existing Anglican church in Brisbane, was opened for worship on the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, 8 September 1869, by Bishop Tufnell, although some alterations were still taking place into the early 1870s. In 1873, the parish was divided, with the parish of Milton being established. An adjacent rectory was built in 1880, and a hall/school building in 1884. Christ Accepting His Cross by Andor M√©sz√°ros The east end of the church contains the oldest stained glass windows in Brisbane, installed in 1870. The altar lights, presented in 1884, were the first in Brisbane. Artwork includes plaster Stations of the Cross sculpted by Brisbane artist Daphne Mayo in 1935, and a bronze and wood sculpture entitled Christ Accepting The Cross, by Andre Meszaros, erected in the forecourt to celebrate the centenary of All Saints in 1962. The organ, made in London by TC Lewis and originally installed in St Johns Pro-Cathedral in Queen's Park in 1873, was transferred to St Luke's Church of England in Charlotte Street, and later refurbished and moved to All Saints in 1957. The organ loft with circular cast iron stair, are later additions and are located at the western end of the church. The original shingle roof has been replaced a number of times, currently with ribbed metal sheeting. The church floor was replaced and walls repointed in 1933, and in 1934 the stone fence facing Wickham Terrace replaced a timber fence constructed in 1871. In 1988, both hall and rectory were sold and demolished for the construction of an adjacent highrise tower. In 1993, a new church hall and office complex fronting Ann Street were constructed and a substantial section of the stone wall along Wickham Terrace was demolished.  Description  This single-storeyed stone church sits on a raised triangular site at the junction of Ann Street and Wickham Terrace, Brisbane. Its style is nineteenth century Gothic Revival, with buttressed walls of rough faced rubble, porphyry and sandstone, and a metal clad roof. The interior has a fine example of a hammer-beam ceiling, which is rare in Australia. The rectangular plan has a raised pulpit, projecting chancel and vestry. A transept is suggested by gables on the north and south elevations, and the building shows gothic influences in its design. The gabled roof is clad with ribbed metal sheeting and features double-ridge ventilation. The chancel has a similar roof, but at a lower height, with a small section of clerestory. The vestry has a skillion roof. The western elevation has twin stone entrance porches, three lancet windows and a stone cross at the top of the gable. Dressed stone work is used around windows and to the top of the gable, and a Latin inscription reads DOMUS MEA DOMUS ORATIONIS (translated \\"my house shall be called a house of prayer\\"). The chancel gable has three lancets, two quatrefoils and a rose window surmounted by a vesica. The eastern nave gable is surmounted by a carved stone bellcote from which a bell is hung. A timber entrance porch with a stone base and gabled roof is located on the northern elevation. There is also a plaque commemorating the dedication of the church. The southern elevation has brick banding to the corners of the stone plinth. The transept gables have two quatrefoils and a rose window with dressed stone surrounds. Internally, walls are rendered and all windows feature stained glass. The nave has hammer-beam trusses with a boarded ceiling. The chancel has scissor braces with a boarded ceiling. An organ gallery has been installed at the western end of the nave. This is supported by metal posts and is accessed via a spiral cast-iron stair. Fluorescent lights are fixed to the underside of the hammerbeams. A carved and painted timber screen surrounds the side chapel, and plaster mouldings feature around windows and above the arch to the chancel. The floors are of timber, with the sanctuary and chancel raised above the nave. Two stone arches, which have been infilled with stone blocks, appear on the western elevation and to the south side of the chancel. The grounds include remnants of a row of palm trees, and stone fencing, masonry gate posts with a gothic-style gas lantern (now electrified) along the Wickham Street boundary, and a large jacaranda to the southwest of the nave. The church contains the oldest stained glass in Queensland as well as other significant art works, such as the first public work of the acclaimed Brisbane sculptor Daphne Mayo (the 14 Stations of the Cross).  Worship  By the early 1900s, the services at All Saints were considered the most Anglo-Catholic in the diocese. In 1923 the use of incense in public worship was introduced, and three years later the pulpit crucifix was installed. In Brisbane, All Saints developed as the high Church of England while St John's Cathedral remained the low church. In keeping with the Anglo- Catholic heritage of the parish, services which include celebration of the Holy Eucharist are styled \\"Mass\\". There is currently a Low Mass with hymns at 7:30 am and a High Mass at 9:30 am each Sunday. Said Masses are held on weekdays in the lady chapel in the south-eastern corner of the church. Choral Evensong (followed by Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament) is held on the first Sunday of each month at 6:30 pm. All Saints' parish maintains a small choir which sings from the west end gallery. The choir's repertoire consists largely of traditional plainsong and Renaissance polyphonic music (including motets by William Byrd, and Tom√°s Luis de Victoria) but some more recent music is performed as well. The church has an 1873 T. C. Lewis organ which was originally installed in St John's Pro-Cathedral in William Street. It was installed in All Saints' in the 1950s. Between 2002 and 2007, it was substantially rebuilt and enlarged by Brisbane organ builder W. J. Simon Pierce. All Saints' Church is a member of Forward in Faith, a traditionalist Anglo-Catholic movement which rejects the ordination of women and liberal views on homosexuality.  Notable members of the congregation  All Saints' Church has played a significant part in the story of Brisbane's development into a city of culture and significance. To this day, All Saints' is regarded by many as the \\"Parish Church of the City of Brisbane\\". Well-known identities who worshipped at All Saints' in the nineteenth century included: * Sir James Dickson, Premier of Queensland and Minister of Defence in the first Commonwealth Government * The Hon. John Douglas, Premier of Queensland * Sir Robert Ramsey Mackenzie, Premier of Queensland * Mary Peattie  Heritage listing  All Saints Anglican Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.

It is exported as the AIM. The Pistol MitralierƒÉ model 1965 (abbreviated PM md. 65 or simply md. 65) is the underfolding-stock version of the md. 63, and is exported as the AIMS. History In the early 1960s, the Romanian Army used mostly PPSh-41, Ori≈£a submachine guns and imported AK-47 rifles. With the development of the stamped Type 4 AKM receiver, and the Soviet Union's call to each of the Warsaw Pact's nations to produce their own assault rifles chambered in 7.62mm, be they AK-47 pattern or not, the Romanian State Arsenal developed an AKM clone featuring a forward-pointing front handgrip molded into the lower handguard, called the Pistol MitralierƒÉ model 1963 (literally 'machine pistol' model 1963). The underfolding stock version is designated the Pistol MitralierƒÉ model 1965, and features a rear-pointing front handgrip, allowing the underfolding stock to be completely retracted. Features The PM md. 63/65 is almost identical to the AKM/AKMS, and thus is simple, inexpensive to manufacture, and easy to clean and maintain. The bore and chamber, as well as the gas piston and the interior of the gas cylinder, are generally chromium-plated. This plating dramatically increases the life of these parts by resisting corrosion and wear. Most md. 63/65 rifles lack a muzzle brake, but instead use a muzzle nut, as muzzle brakes entered production only in the late 1970s. The underfolding version is unique among the AKMS as it uses the thicker milled AKS type stock and arms, even locking only on the left side and being angled downwards just like the AKS. Some have speculated that the stocks may have even been surplus Romania purchased from Russia. The md 65's rear trunnion is also different compared to the standard AKMS's version, differing in that it only has the two locking holes on the left side, has only two pairs of rivets near the back of the trunnion and a bar connecting the two sides of the trunnion at the front. The navy is the only remaining large scale operator of the md. 65 because of the weight of the metal underfolding stock. The fire selector markings are as follows, from top to bottom: Domestic‚ÄîS, FA, FF. Export‚ÄîS, A, R. Operating Cycle To fire, the operator inserts a loaded magazine, moves the selector lever to the lowest position, pulls back and releases the charging handle, and then pulls the trigger. In this setting, the gun fires once, requiring the trigger be released and depressed again for the next shot until the magazine is exhausted. With the selector in the middle position, the rifle continues to fire, automatically cycling fresh rounds into the chamber, until the magazine is exhausted or pressure is released from the trigger. Disassembly Dismantling the md. 63/65 is identical to dismantling the AKM and it involves the operator depressing the magazine catch and removing the magazine. The charging handle is pulled to the rear and the operator inspects the chamber to verify the weapon is unloaded. The operator presses forward on the retainer button at the rear of the receiver cover while simultaneously lifting up on the rear of the cover to remove it. The operator then pushes the spring assembly forward and lifts it from its raceway, withdrawing it out of the bolt carrier and to the rear. The operator must then pull the carrier assembly all the way to the rear, lift it, and then pull it away. The operator removes the bolt by pushing it to the rear of the bolt carrier; rotating the bolt so the camming lug clears the raceway on the underside of the bolt carrier and then pulls it forward and free. When cleaning, the operator will pay special attention to the barrel, bolt face, and gas piston, then oil lightly and reassemble. Patriotic Guards version A reconstructed 'GardƒÉ' PM md. 63, with an US-made receiver. The most-produced civilian export variation of this rifle is that of the 'GardƒÉ' designation, produced for the Romanian Patriotic Guards. These rifles have a letter 'G' engraved on the left side of the rear sight block. The civil guard versions are modified by the removal of the sear and the modification of the disconnector to be semi-automatic only. Tens of thousands of these have been imported into the United States and sold as 'parts kits' (the receiver is destroyed by torch-cutting per BATF regulations ‚Äì without the receiver, the kit is no longer legally considered a firearm). They are colloquially known among firearms enthusiasts as \\"Romy G's\\". Other civilian versions Other civilian 7.62mm Romanian AK clones are: SAR 1, WASR 10 (including WASR 10/63), Romak 991, Romak 1, and WUM 1. The Wieger rifle lookalikes known as the STG-2000 and STG-2003 are based on WASR 10 rifles, which are the only ones still in production. A version of the PM md. 90 carbine is also available in the United States, known as the \\"Draco\\" it has the folding stock removed and thus the BATF sees it as a pistol and legal to import. In Germany there are civilian versions on the market under the name / modell Cugir WS1-63 (fixed wood stock), WS1-64 (underfolder stock), WS1-64SB (Short Barrel 314mm with the underfolder stock). The WS1-63HO is the straight pull non semi auto version. The gun must be charged after every shot that is fired. PM md. 80 The Pistol MitralierƒÉ model 1980 is a short barreled AK variant, and the first side-folding stock version produced in Romania. It featured a shorter gas block and usually used 20 round magazines. The front sight post is combined with the gas-block to provide an overall short length. The side folder is straight and folds to the left. There are two types of muzzle brakes used: a cylindrical one, and more commonly a slightly conical one. It is also known as the AIMR. PM md. 90 PM md. 90 carbine The Pistol MitralierƒÉ model 1990 is the 7.62mm response to the 5.45mm Pu»ôcƒÉ AutomatƒÉ model 1986. It is internally identical to a PM md. 63/65, and outwardly differs in that it has a wire folding stock identical to the PA md. 86 stock, and that all of the rifles are fitted with slant brakes. It was extensively used in the Romanian Revolution of 1989 along with the md. 63 and md. 65 Short barrel version The carbine version of the model 90, called simply PM md. 90 cu »õeavƒÉ scurtƒÉ (short barreled PM md. 90), has a 12-inch [305 mm] barrel, an overall length of 31.69 inches [805 mm] (or 23.81 inches [605 mm] with the stock folded), and weighs 6.83 lbs. (3.1 kg) empty. It was designed for tank crews and special forces. Apart from the stock and the shortened barrel, it features the same modifications as the PM md. 80. 7.62 mm RPK The RPK version of the md. 63 is called the md. 64. It is essentially identical to the Soviet RPK.

The story derives from The Chalk Circle, a 14th-century play by Li Xingdao, and can be seen as a \\"first draft\\" for Brecht's subsequent play, The Caucasian Chalk Circle. Plot=Summary The story is set during the Thirty Years War. Zingli, a Protestant of means, delays leaving his home in Augsburg until the Catholic forces are plundering the city. His wife spends too much time packing her clothes, and so is forced to flee emptyhanded, leaving the child behind. Their maid, Anna, a simple girl, rescues the child and flees to her brother's farm in the country. To avoid humiliation as an unwed mother, Anna claims that she is waiting for her husband to return for her. Given the nature of the war, the ruse is plausible for a time, but eventually, to avoid suspicion and possible eviction, she feels compelled to produce a husband. She marries a man who is on his deathbed, expecting to be a widow soon; however, he recovers and she must live with him for a few years. When the war ends, Frau Zingli returns to reclaim her son. Ignatz Dollinger, a wise judge, cannot determine who is the real mother, so enacts a version of the Judgment of Solomon. The child is placed inside a chalk circle with two ropes tied around him: one in the hands of each claimant. Anna is unwilling to risk harm to the child, so pulls only lightly, while Frau Zingli pulls with force that could have \\"ripped the child in two.\\" Although Anna appears to have lost the contest, the wise judge rules that, having shown the greater love, Anna is the fit and rightful mother. Differences from the original While the essential form of the story and its resolution remain the same as in the original play, there are several important differences. Most obviously, the setting is changed from Imperial China to Germany, but the period chosen (the greatest civil war in the turbulent history of that country) has important consequences for the story. Notably: *The cause of the conflict is not personal (jealousy), but political (the division between Catholics and Protestants). *The heroine must engage in a deception to preserve her status in the community. *The nature of the heroine's claim on the child is changed from biological mother to de facto adoption. *The just reason to deny the wife's claim is changed from lack of biological status to neglect: she loses control of the child because she is more concerned with her clothes than with her maternal duty. *The Imperial intervention at the end of the story becomes unnecessary and out of place, and is therefore dropped.

Lawsuits In March 2019, investors filed more than two dozen lawsuits in Indiana and New Jersey, claiming that Morris was running a Ponzi scheme involving the sales of some houses in C- and D-class neighborhoods through his investment company, Morris Invest, in Indianapolis, Indiana. The investors claim they were sold rental properties which Morris Invest promised to rehabilitate and rent out, earning them rental income. Some claim they later discovered the properties they received rental income from for several months were boarded up and vacant and they began receiving city code and country health department violations. Others found they had purchased vacant lots, small shacks or buildings that were falling down. By July 2019, Morris had moved the family to a resort town on the coast of Portugal. The Morrises say they and several members of their family also lost money because of the underhanded business practices of former business partner Bert Whalen of Oceanpointe Investments. Whalen is accused of taking money entrusted to him for purchases, rehabilitations, and property management costs and forging documents when asked for updates and receipts. The Morrises intend to fight the suits from overseas. Federal and state law enforcement officials would not comment on whether or not there was a criminal investigation. In March 2020, Clayton Morris lost a $7.2 million copyright infringement lawsuit against HoltonWiseTV. The lawsuit, filed in Federal Court by Morris in October 2019, stemmed from HoltonWiseTV's production of a three hour documentary investigating the alleged involvement of Morris in various real estate scams.

She attained a royal pension by convincing the authorities that she was the secret daughter of King Gustav IV of Sweden and Queen Frederica of Baden.  The fraud  The exiled Gustav IV and Frederica of Baden had divorced in 1812, but Helga de la Brache claimed that they had married again, secretly, \\"in a convent in Germany\\", which resulted in her birth in Lausanne in 1820. She was later sent to be raised by her alleged father's aunt, Princess Sophia Albertine of Sweden. When the Princess died in 1829, she was taken to the Vadstena asylum, so that the secret of her birth would be concealed as she would be thought to be insane. She was saved in 1834 and taken to her family in Baden, where she was placed under house arrest. In 1837, upon seeing the news of her father's death in the paper, she forgot to hide her grief. She returned to Sweden, where she was again put in an asylum to prevent the secret of her birth to be revealed. She managed to escape from the asylum, and was taken under the care of charitable people, who supported her despite persecution, and soon, she was given a pension of 6,000 ¬ß from her mother's family in Germany. In 1850, the pension had ceased coming, and she was unable to continue the standard of life to which she of birth had been accustomed - and she was also forced to support her many faithful friends, who stood by her during her years of persecution: No smaller pension than 5,000 or 6,000 would be sufficient. Her story was believed by many private people in Sweden and Finland. She received great financial support from private benefactors. Followed by her faithful companion, who was an educated and cultivated woman who supported her story, de la Brache performed with a simplicity and naivete which made people unable to suspect she was cunning enough to have made it all up, and sensible enough for people to think that she did not believe it because she was mad. Eventually, even the skeptics had to admit that the story was at least theoretically possible. One of the reasons to why such a story could be believed, was that all contact with the deposed former dynasty was forbidden in 19th-century Sweden, which made it hard to verify and examine what would be likely regarding their family relations. She convinced the salon hostess Frances Lewin-von Koch (1804‚Äì1888), the British born spouse of the minister of justice, Nils von Koch, who housed her and provided her with a lawyer, and through her also her husband; the parliamentary Anders Uhr and the royal court chaplain Carl Norrby, but was seen as a fraud by Prime minister Louis De Geer and foreign minister Ludvig Manderstr√∂m. The queen mother Josefina took an interest in her, and provided her with an allowance. She was granted a meeting with Charles XV who, afterward, remarked to the parliamentarians: \\"Why, she is just as sane as you or me\\". The king did not take much interest, but wanted to get the whole affair over and done with. In March 1861, the king allowed her an annual pension from the foreign department of 2,400 Swedish riksdaler a year, (the amount, from the beginning 1.200, was made larger in December 1869). He also promised to provide her with the furniture of a princess. She managed to continue this for years. In 1870, however, an article in a newspaper by C. Norrby, one of her benefactors, appeared, resulting in an investigation.  The real story  In 1876‚Äì77, it was proved that she was born in Stockholm as Aurora Florentina Magnusson to the custom caretaker Anders Magnusson (died 1826). Her mother was left a poor widow with five children, and Magnusson only received one year of school education. At the confirmation of Aurora Magnusson, her mother was overheard saying, that Aurora was not her biological daughter, but a foster child. She named her biological parents and both belonging to the upper classes: her father as Count De Geer, and her mother as a \\"F√∂rn√§m fr√∂ken\\" (Unmarried noblewoman). This may have been either true or false, as no information has been confirmed one way or the other. True or false, it is nevertheless believed to have affected Aurora Magnusson greatly. In 1835, she was a maid to a book-keeper named Hedman, where the family said that she always had the mind to \\"rise above her status\\". In 1838, she was employed by the wealthy merchant Henrik Aspegren on V√§sterl√•nggatan 78, whose daughter, Henrika, became deeply devoted to her, dressed her in elegant clothes and left her family for her. She was originally hired as a sewing help for the daughters of the Aspegren family to prepare for a ball. When the Aspegren's was about to leave for the ball, Magnusson burst into tears and told them that she was homeless and had nowhere to sleep for the night, and she was thereby invited to stay. It was Henrika Aspegren who later became her companion and accomplice in the fraud. When the two women moved to Finland in 1844, Aurora Florentina had the name de la Brache on her passport, and when she returned to Sweden in 1845, she changed her name to Anna Florentina de la Brache. She was named : \\"De la Brache, Anna Florentina, Miss, formerly known by the name Aurora Magnusson\\". She managed to have her name changed from her birth certificate to Helga. Aurora Magnusson was reported drowned. The two women can be traced to have moved around from one city to another in both Sweden and Finland - Helga was often supported by her friend, who worked as a teacher. In 1846 they were in Turku, where they managed a girls' school advertised by the noble name of de la Brache, and where Helga, as it was said, mastered the art of fainting upon uncomfortable questions from parents. In 1848, they lived in √ñrebro, in 1857‚Äì59 in Sala, where they tried to start a fashion shop, before they arrived in Stockholm in the 1860s to commence their fraud. Aftermath The trial in 1876‚Äì77 drew much attention both from the public and the royal family and was much reported in the papers. It led to the loss of the pension of Helga/Florentina. On 2 March 1877 Helga de la Brache was judged guilty of having registered herself under a false name, year of birth and for not tax- registered herself for the year of 1877, and sentenced to fines Lindorm, Erik : Oscar II och hans tid (The epoch of Oscar II) (1979) \\"Princess Helga de la Brache\\" spent her last years in an apartment in Klara norra with her companion, seemingly paid for by a supporter. The two women lived a quiet life, walked in the park and ordered home food and rarely talked to other people, although Helga was described as a nice old woman. In 1884, however, the two women were observed in the gardens of Drottningholm Palace by King Oscar II, who ordered them to be escorted from the park. Soon after, they moved from their apartment to another one in Djurg√•rden, because they were afraid that they were going to be arrested. During her last years, she was described as dignified and sad. According to the artist Georg von Rosen, who was present at her death bed, she was genuinely convinced about her royal birth. She died in Djurg√•rden 1885. In 1909, the politician Per August Johansson tried to clear her name, but the process led to nothing. The later process of the 1910s was centered around the fact, that Frederica of Baden had named the Russian czar as the guardian of her children after her divorce, and because of this, Helga de la Brache was to have been entitled to economic compensation from the Russian czar. This process ended with the Russian revolution of 1917. Several books have been written about her.

It is present in the embryonic and fetal stages of neural development found between the thalamus and caudate nucleus.Encha-Razavi & Sonigo. (2003). Features of the developing brain. Child's Nervous System. pp. 426-428 The eminence is divided into three regions of the ventral ventricular zone of the telencephalon (a lateral, medial and caudal eminence), where they facilitate tangential cell migration during embryonic development. Tangential migration does not involve interactions with radial glial cells; instead the interneurons migrate perpendicularly through the radial glial cells to reach their final location. The characteristics and function of the cells that follow the tangential migration pathway seem to be closely related to the location and precise timing of their production, and the GEs contribute significantly to building up the GABAergic cortical cell population.Hern√°ndez-Miranda, Parnavelas, & Chiara. (2010). Molecules & mechanisms involved in the generation and migration of cortical interneurons. ASN Neuro, 2(2). pp. 75-86. Another structure that the GEs contribute to is the basal ganglia. The GEs also guide the axons growing from the thalamus into the cortex and vice versa. In humans, the GEs disappear by one year of age. During development, neuronal migration continues until the extinction of the germ layer, at which point the remnants from the germ layer make up the eminences. Categorization Coronal section in the forebrain of an embryonic mouse at 12.5 days of gestation (preplate stage), showing the lateral and medial ganglionic eminences (LGE, MGE) from which GABAergic interneurons tangentially migrate to the cortical anlage (left, yellow). Glutamatergic neurons destined for the cortex are generated locally in the cortical ventricular zone and migrate radially (right, red). Ganglionic eminences are categorized into three groups based on their location within the subventricular zone: * Medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) * Lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) * Caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) A sulcus separates the medial and lateral ganglionic eminences. The expression of Nkx2-1, Gsx2, and Pax6 is required to determine the independent progenitor cell populations in the LGE and MGE. Interactions between these three genes define the boundaries between the different progenitor zones and mutations of these genes can cause abnormal expansion around the MGE, LGE, ventral pallium (VP), and anterior entopeduncular region (AEP). The cells of the GEs are quite homogenous, with the MGE, LGE, and CGE all having small, dark, irregular nuclei and moderately dense cytoplasm, however, each eminence can be identified by the type of progeny that it produces. See the individual GE sections below for more information on the different types of progeny produced. Additionally, the subventricular zone is the starting point of multiple streams of tangentially migrating interneurons that express Dlx genes. There are three main tangential migration pathways that have been identified in this region: # the latero-caudal migration (subpallial telencephalon to cortex) # the medio-rostral migration (subpallial basal telencephalon to the olfactory bulb) # the latero-caudal migration (basal telencephalon to the striatum) These pathways are temporally and spatially distinct, and produce a variety of GABAergic, and non-GABAergic interneurons. One example of GABAergic interneurons that the GEs guide are parvalbumin- containing interneurons in the neocortex. Some examples of non-GABAergic interneurons that the GEs guide are dopaminergic interneurons in the olfactory bulb, and cholinergic interneurons in the striatum. Cells migrating along these pathways move at different rates. Some molecules that have been implicated in controlling the rate of the unidirectional movement of cells derived from the GEs are hepatocyte growth factor/scattered factor (HGF/SF), and various neurotrophic factors. Medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) The primary purpose of the MGE during development is to produce GABAergic stellate cells and direct their migration to the neocortex. The precursors of most GABAergic interneurons in the cerebral cortex migrate from the subcortical progenitor zone. More specifically, performing a mechanical transection of the migratory route from the MGE to the neocortex causes a 33% decrease in GABAergic interneurons in the neocortex. The MGE also produces some of the neurons and glia of the basal ganglia and hippocampus.Sanes, Reh, & Harris. (2012). Development of the Nervous System. 3rd ed. Academic Press. pp. 62-63. . The MGE may also be a source of Cajal-Retzius cells, but this remains controversial. Early in embryonic development, the interneurons in the cortex stem primarily from the MGE Lavdas, Grigoriou, Pachnis, & Parnavelas. (1999). The medial ganglionic eminence gives rise to a population of early neurons in the developing cerebral cortex. The Journal of Neuroscience, 99(19). pp. 7881-7888.and the AEP. In vitro experiments show that MGE cells migrate more than 300 Œºm per day, three times faster than the migration of LGE cells. See more about the time frame and function of MGE in comparison to the LGE in the following section. Lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) Compared to the early temporal frame of development in the MGE, the LGE aids in the tangential migration of cells later in the mid-embryogenic stage. Unlike the MGE, which guides most cell migration into the cortex during this stage, the LGE contributes less to cell migration to the cortex, and instead guides many cells to the olfactory bulbs. In fact, the migration to the olfactory bulb is led by the LGE into adulthood. The route that newly generated neurons take from the anterior subventricular zone to the olfactory bulb is called the rostral migratory stream. During the late stages of embryonic development, both the LGE and MGE guide cell migration to the cortex, specifically the proliferative regions of the cortex. Some studies have found that the LGE also contributes cells to the neocortex, but this remains an issue of debate. In vitro, cells migrating from the LGE travel at a rate of 100 Œºm per day, slower than the MGE cells. Caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) The caudal ganglionic eminence is another subcortical structure that is essential to the generation of cortical interneurons. It is located next to the lateral ventricle, posterior to where the LGE and MGE fuse. The CGE is a fusion of the rostral medial and lateral ganglionic eminence, which begins at the mid to caudal thalamus. There are two molecular domains that exist within the CGE and closely resemble extensions of the caudal MGE and LGE. The CGE is distinct from the LGE and MGE in gene expression patterns and progeny produced. Unlike the cells from the MGE, the cells from the CGE were rarely parvalbumin- containing neurons. It seems that the majority of cells from the CGE were GABAergic interneurons, but depending on where they are located, CGE-derived cells are very diverse. CGE-derived cells include GABAergic interneurons, spiny interneurons, mossy cells, pyramidal and granule neurons, and even oligodendrocyte and astrocyte glial cells. Cell migration Cells in the ganglionic eminence migrate tangentially to neocortex, giving rise to interneurons. A variety of molecular mechanisms cooperate to direct this process. Embryonic interneuronal migration to the cerebral cortex is mediated by an array of motogenic growth factors in the MGE, repulsive factors in the striatum and LGE, permissive factors in migratory corridors in the ganglionic eminence, and attractive factors in the cortex itself. Cells in the LGE migrate to the striatal domain (caudate nucleus and putamen) and parts of the septum and amygdala. MGE cells follow a migratory path to the globus pallidus and part of the septum. The CGE gives rise to interneurons in the nucleus accumbens, the bed nucleus of the stria terminals, the hippocampus, and specific nuclei in the amygdala. This directed migration is induced by differences in gene expression between these subpallial domains. An array of genes are involved in the differentiation and specification of interneurons and oligodendrocytes, including: Dlx1, Dlx2, Gsh1, Mash1, Gsh2, Nkx2.1, Nkx5.1, Isl1, Six3 and Vax1. Molecular mechanisms for directed migration The induced migration of cells from the ganglionic eminence during development is directed by a variety of motogenic factors, molecules that increase cell motility, and chemotactic molecules. The motogenic factor HGF/SF enhances cell motility and directs cells away from subpallial regions and demarcates the routes followed by migrating cells. Neurotrophins, such as BDNF, are a family of motogenic factors involved in directing migration. The cerebral cortex provides chemoattractant molecules (for example NRG1 type I and II in the cortex) while subpallial areas produce chemorepulsive molecules (for example Slit) to direct cell migration. Additionally, some permissive factors (such as NRG1 type III) in the migratory corridors are necessary for this process to occur. The neurotransmitters GABA and 5-HT have been implicated in the migration as well. High GABA concentrations have been seen to cause random cell movement (\\"random walk migration\\"), while low concentrations promote directed migration. 5-HT has been tied to the process of incorporating interneurons into the cortical plate, as well as in the differentiation into subpopulations of interneurons. Associated disorders The migration of cells from the ventricular zone to their intended destination and the success of their differentiation can be interrupted in many different ways, including interference with mechanical motors or an alteration of molecular signals that initiate movement, lead the cell in migration, and terminate its migration. The function of the molecules that affect migration are not confined to cell movement, overlapping considerably with the events associated with neurogenesis. As a result, neuronal migration syndromes are difficult to classify. The largest class of neuronal migration syndromes is lissencephaly. This includes a spectrum of simplified cortex ranging from agyria (a total absence of cortical convolutions) to pachygyria (broadened gyri) with unusually thick cortex. Mis-migration of neurons can also result in bilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia, a disease recognized by neuronal heterotopia lining the lateral ventricles. Zellweger Syndrome is characterized by a cortical dysplasia similar to polymicrogyria of cerebral and cerebellar cortex, occasionally with pachygyria surrounding the Sylvian fissure, and focal/subependymal heterotopia. Kallmann syndrome is recognized by anosmia associated with mental retardation, hypogonadism, and the failure of the olfactory bulb to develop. Disorders of axonal projection and assembly are rarely pure, but closely related to neuronal migration genes. This notably includes agenesis of the corpus callosum. Disturbances in the genesis of neural elements can result in cortical dysplasia. Examples include ectopic neurogenesis, microencephaly, and altered cell survival resulting in areas of hyperplasia, reduced apoptosis, and heterotopia.Ross, M. E., & Walsh, C. A. (2001). Human brain malformations and their lessons for neuronal migration. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 24(1), 1041-1070. Further research Further research could be done on the migration of cells from the basal ganglia to the neocortex. The molecular mechanisms in control of this are still not completely clarified. The number of known mutations that could interfere with neuronal migration is rapidly growing, and will continue to do so as further research is performed. The complexity of molecular steps needed to correctly place cells in a system as complicated as the brain is impressive, and as more pieces to this intricate puzzle arise, it will be easier to come up with strategies to remedy disorders associated with neuronal migration, and to potentially repair damage caused by trauma, stroke, maldevelopment, and aging.

Personal life Daphne Mayo (seated front and centre), Wattle Day celebrations, Brisbane, 1914 Born in Balmain, Sydney in 1895, she was educated in Brisbane at St. Margaret's Anglican Girls School, and received a Diploma in Art Craftsmanship from the Brisbane Central Technical College in 1913. At the college she was strongly influenced by L.J Harvey who initiated her interest in modelling. She further developed her skills in this medium when she was presented with an opportunity to go to London in 1919 through an art scholarship provided by Queensland Wattle League. There she took a position as an assistant sculptor before her acceptance into the Sculpture School of the Royal Academy. Prominent works Despite her small frame, Mayo produced many physically demanding works that were carved in situ. On her return to Brisbane in 1925, Daphne created a number of local works including: The Brisbane City Hall tympanum * The Brisbane City Hall tympanum (1927‚Äì30). The tympanum represents a relief of early settlement entitled \\"The progress of civilisation in the State of Queensland\\". This sculpture has been considered one of the most important Brisbane sculpture commissions ever awarded. Queensland Women's War Memorial * The Queensland Women's War Memorial (1929‚Äì32) located in Brisbane's Anzac Square is a sandstone relief of a military procession. The first war memorial depicting servicewomen, this piece is also important for highlighting the important contribution made by women to the tradition of war memorials.Women and the arts - Queensland women contributions to the Heritage Register The Brisbane Women's Club conceived the idea of the Queensland Women's War Memorial in 1929 at the outset of the Depression. A campaign was launched to raise a thousand pounds for the Memorial but as insufficient funds were raised the original concept of a panel cast in bronze and a cascading fountain was changed to a carved stone panel and water fountain.

It was established in the 1890s, and was directed by Carlo Curti in early 1900s, Joseph Knecht at least from 1908 to 1925, later by Jack Denny and others, and then Xavier Cugat from approximately 1933 to 1949. Denny and the Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria Orchestra appeared in the movie Moonlight and Pretzels in 1933.\\"Xavier Cugat: The King of the Rhumba\\"Dismuke: Jack DennyIMDb: Moonlight and Pretzels Both Denny and Cugat had their own orchestras when they began playing at the Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria, so the term \\"Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria orchestras\\" might be an appropriate description. History The Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria hotel was originally built as two separate adjacent hotels, the Waldorf in 1893 and the Astoria in 1897. Both were on the land that is now occupied by the Empire State Building, and the two hotels were connected after construction of the second one. The hotel had its current site on Park Avenue built in 1931. In addition to the normal function of a hotel to house its guests and provide them with amenities, the Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria had an extensive program of social activities, to include concerts by top artists and an orchestra to provide music for its dinner guests. An 1898 New York Times article mentions that the Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria Orchestra played at the Astoria,\\"Well Known Artists Contribute to Life's Fresh Air Fund\\", New York Times, June 21, 1898, p. 7 and a 1901 New York Times Article mentions \\"Prof. Clappe, leader of the Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria Orchestra, and the other fifteen performers.\\"New York Times, December 4, 1901, p. 1.

Shilkret says he was a member of the Orchestra while attending the City College of New York. A search of the college's files shows Shilkret attended classes in the Fall 1904 semester and is listed as an alumnus, Class of ex'1910. This information establishes Knecht as director prior to 1910. Shilkret described the hotel as \\"almost a conservatory, rather than a hotel engagement. ... There were thirty-five men engaged steadily for the dining rooms. In the Rose Room, Caruso records were played, with our group following the music of the record.\\" Shilkret said that there were nightly concerts from 9 pm to 10 pm, with the Orchestra enlarged to fifty on Sundays, and chamber music from 11 pm to 1 am, with Joseph Knecht as director. Music historian Howard Pollack says, \\"This hotel orchestra, comprising a highly trained group of mostly Italian and Jewish musicians, regularly gave serious concerts, including one that [George] Gershwin attended on April 13, 1913, at which [Charles] Hambitzer performed the first movement of Anton Rubinstein's Piano Concerto in D Minor.Pollack, Howard, George Gershwin: His Life and Work, University of California Press, Berkeley, 2006, p. 26. (Pollack quotes Shilkret as saying that Hambitzer was \\"one of the greatest pianists I ever heard. I would say he was a genius.\\") Pollack says Hambitzer came to New York no later than 1908 and began playing in the string section (Hambitzer played many instruments) of the Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria Orchestra.

Plot The film is set in immediate postwar Japan, Tokyo. Tokiko (Kinuyo Tanaka), a twenty-nine-year-old mother of a young boy of four, is waiting for her husband's repatriation from World War II. In postwar Tokyo prices are escalating and the mother rents a room in a working-class industrial district, making ends meet through dressmaking. She is supported by a long-time friend and former workmate Akiko (Chieko Murata). One day, Tokiko's son little Hiroshi falls ill and needs to be hospitalized. Although Hiroshi subsequently recovers, the high hospital bills force Tokiko to commit one desperate act: she decides to prostitute herself for a night at an out-of- the-way establishment. When Akiko finds out about this she chides Tokiko for being stupid, and Tokiko begins to feel shame and folly even though she explains she has no other choice. The husband, Shuichi Amamiya (Sh≈´ji Sano), finally returns from the war belatedly and the couple is blissfully reunited. However, the conversation turns to Hiroshi's recent illness and Tokiko, finding it impossible to lie, comes clean with her husband over what she has done. Shuichi flies into a rage and is totally unable to concentrate on his job for the next few days. Thoughts about his wife's \\"misdeed\\" obsesses him and he finds out from her exactly where the establishment is. Then he makes a secret visit to the place one afternoon, only to find another young, 21-year- old prostitute about to service him there. From her he realizes that her resort to prostitution is out of desperation: her father is unable to work and her younger brother is in school. Shuichi resolves to find for the girl a proper job at his workplace. Shuichi confides his troubles to his colleague, Satake (Chish≈´ Ry≈´). Satake promises to do his best to help the girl, and advises Shuichi to forgive his wife. But Shuichi states that he simply cannot help getting upset over Tokiko's act. When he returns home, Tokiko tries desperately to placate him and apologizes repeatedly over her mistake, but Shuichi treats her brutally and violently, throwing her down a flight of stairs accidentally by force. When he realizes she is hurt, he begins to get a grip over himself. An injured Tokiko limps back up the room and tries further to reconcile with Shuichi, who confesses that he too is in the wrong. They finally embrace each other desperately and promise to forget everything and start anew, relying on each other for their ultimate support.

Fate In 1994 Murmansk was sold to India for scrapping but ran aground off the Norwegian village of S√∏rv√¶r during the transfer. During that time, a photo was taken by a native Norwegian that had shown the ship in almost perfect condition with a massive list. It was first estimated that the winter storms would destroy parts of Murmansk above the water, but the ship remained in one piece and in 2009 funding was allocated to pay for the dismantling of the vessel. Since the ship was in a very bad state when the decision to remove it was made, there was no possibility to tow it. Scandinavia's largest demolition contractor, AF Decom, constructed a massive breakwater and dry dock around Murmansk to access the shipwreck from land and demolish it where it rested. The dock around the wreck was sealed in April 2012. By mid-May the dock was almost empty of water and the demolishing of the cruiser began. The project was completed in 2013. There is a dispute about possible radioactive substances within the ship.

The time when the main line network was established. * Epoch Ib - the middle period from 1893 to 1912. The boom time for the branch lines. * Epoch Ic - the late period from 1913 to 1920. The war years and aftermath until the formation of the Deutsche Reichsbahn. In practice Epoch Ic may have extended into the mid-1920s because it would have taken time for practices to change and for wagons to be repainted. In Bavaria, this may have taken longer than elsewhere, because they were part of the independent 'Bavarian Group Administration', the only one of its kind in the Reichsbahn. The following sections explain the goods wagon classification schemes in the 3 epochs.  Epoch Ia (1867-92) ‚Äì the first wagon classification scheme  The first numbering system was introduced in 1867 and used capital letters for the various types of goods wagon as follows: *A = goods vans *B or BD = flat wagons for MOW-work ‚Äì Bahndienstwagen *C = vans with steam boilers for train heating ‚Äì Heizwagen *D or DW = guards vans for P and G trains ‚Äì Dienstwagen *E = open wagons with high sides *F = open wagons with low sides, long *G = open wagons with low sides, short *H = timber trucks *J = luggage vans without guards compt ‚Äì Gep√§ckwagen *K = double-deck livestock vans *L = low-sided open wagons for stone transport *M = peat wagons *N = horse vans *O = cattle wagons, covered or open Photographs indicate that, initially, not all letters were used in their final meaning, but the system was fully developed by 1877 after the nationalization of the Bavarian Ostbahn. It was refined using indices ‚Äì Roman or Arabic numbers ‚Äì to designate old wagons built before 1859 or new, longer, vehicles built after 1880. E.g. an A I was an old, 6-wheeled, goods van for a load of 120 cwt whilst an A¬≥ was a 10 m long ‚Äúmodern‚Äù van for 15t load (10t was ‚Äònormal‚Äô). The owner inscription was K.Bay.Sts.B. with a rather square crowned Bavarian coat of arms (white and blue lozenges). An old-fashioned Antiqua-type was used.  Epoch Ib (1893-1912) ‚Äì the second classification scheme  In 1893 the K.Bay.Sts.B. introduced the intermediate system with capital letters showing the main type and small letters showing things like loading length, load, height of the sides etc. It was similar, but not identical, to the Prussian system; in particular the use of the small letters was quite different. The following table gives the type designations in combination with type description and the number range: *V = livestock wagons (19001 ‚Äì 20000) ‚Äì Viehwagen *G = goods vans (30001 ‚Äì 50000) ‚Äì Gedeckte G√ºterwagen *O = open wagons (50001 ‚Äì 70000) ‚Äì Offene G√ºterwagen *H = timber trucks (70001 ‚Äì 76000) ‚Äì Holzwagen *S = platform wagons (76001 ‚Äì 80000) ‚Äì Schienenwagen *Special wagons, railway-owned (80001 ‚Äì 85000) *Special wagons, private-owned (85001 ‚Äì 90000) *Wagons of private railways (90001 onwards) Examples of small letters used: *l, p for long and very long vehicles *d, h for low and high sides *w, m for < and > 10t max load respectively *e, f, y etc. for special features of certain wagon types Peculiarities of this system were also that double capitals were not only used for 8-wheeled vehicles, but also for 4-wheelers with 20 tons load and more (e.g. OOm(u), a 4-wheel iron coal wagon). Triple capitals - SSS - were used for heavy load 12-wheel well wagons. The owner inscription was K.Bay.Sts.B., now without a coat of arms. A type without serifs was used. In 1909 the German state railways agreed upon the joint use of their freight stock, and founded the German State Railway Wagon Association (Deutscher Staatsbahnwagenverband or DSV). Besides the standardization of goods wagons, standardized wagon numbering, based on the Prussian system, was introduced. As far as can be traced today, the Bavarians waited until 1912/13 before applying it to old wagons, because the yearly amendments to the wagon roster book (of 1903) say ‚Äúfuture‚Äù for the new standardized designations. Furthermore, the standardized designations were altered for some wagon types between 1909 and 1912, when they were given their final meaning. (e.g. for Rungenwagen, SmlRu was planned first, but they became Rm eventually).  Epoch Ic (1912-1920) - the third classification scheme From June 1912 the K Bay Sts B used a new naming and numbering scheme for goods wagons as follows: 1\\\\. Wagons based at a given station, (Stationswagen = DRG Heimatwagen) had the name of the division (Direktion) where they were based. 2\\\\. All wagons of the rechtsrheinisches Netz, east of the Rhine, which could be used freely :a) with less than 15 t load weight were designated Regensburg :b) with 15 t or more load weight and wheel sets of form 39 were designated Augsburg :c) with 15 t or more load weight and wheel sets of form 41 were designated N√ºrnberg 3\\\\. All wagons of the former Palatinate Railway (Pfalzbahn - west of the Rhine) were allocated Ludwigshafen 4\\\\. Private owner wagons received the name of the division where they were stationed. 5\\\\. All new wagons of the Verbandsbauart were designated M√ºnchen (except 1 is valid). In addition to renaming, wagons were re-numbered according to class, see below. The change of designations and in some cases also numbers was documented in a new edition of the wagon roster book. On one hand, the divisions were used for owner inscription (instead of K.Bay.Sts.B.), in combination with a coat of arms (this was Prussian practice too), on the other hand they were used for a kind of sorting.

Unlike the DRG, the Bavarians used divisional names for generations rather than classes of wagon (however W√ºrzburg was unused): 1\\\\. Old generation 1844-1858: 4- and 6-wheeled wagons for loads below 10 tons. Withdrawn by the turn of the 19th/20th century. 2\\\\. Classic generation (mostly Regensburg) 1858-1891: 4-wheeled wagons for 10 tons load; and a handful of 6- and 8-wheelers (mainly platform wagons) for loads of 15 tons and more. :a. Short wagons 1858-1889, with an underframe length of around 7 m; the typical goods wagons of this period :b. Ostbahn wagons (1858‚Äì1875); the Bayerische Ostbahn was a large private railway company nationalized in 1876; wagons with some differences to those of the state railway. :c. Long wagons 1880-1890, with an underframe length of 10 m; mainly large-capacity vans and platform wagons. :d. Transition types 1888-1891; rather short goods wagons for 10 or 12.5 tons load, but with ‚Äúmodern‚Äù design features. 3\\\\. Modern generation 1892-1912: 4-, 6-, 8- and 12-wheeled wagons with a max load of ‚â•15 t (prototypes for the well known Trix-models) :a. Augsburg. All-Bavarian types 1892-1909; already the same main dimensions as their Prussian counterparts, but with typical Bavarian design features (brakeman's cabs, openings for venting etc.). :b. N√ºrnberg. Transition types to the standardized designs of the Verbandsbauart 1909-1912; still typical Bavarian wagons with certain parts of the standardized designs (axleguards, wheelsets type 41); in most cases continuations of 3a, but in some cases (e.g. timber truck) direct forerunner of the standardized designs.

It is native to the eastern and central United States, found from Maine south to North Carolina and Alabama, and west as far as Arkansas, Kansas, and Minnesota.Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution map Description Eupatorium sessilifolium is a perennial herb with stems that are sometimes more than 100 centimeters (40 inches) tall. They are produced from a woody underground caudice or short rhizome. The top of the stems, where the branching begins to the flower heads, have short hairs, while the lower part of the stems have no hairs. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs and are toothed. The leaf bases are rounded and the leaves are sessile (lacking stalks), but they do not clasp around the stem. The foliage is dotted with glands. Eupatorium sessilifolium blooms in August and September (July in the southern part of its range), and the small inflorescences are branched and composed of widely spaced, tiny white flower heads in corymbiform (flat topped) arrays. The heads typically have five or six disc florets per head, but no ray florets. Upland boneset is a threatened species in Michigan, and legally protected in that state.  Hybrids  As is common in Eupatorium, E. sessilifolium can form hybrids with other species in the genus. In particular, Eupatorium godfreyanum is a hybrid of E. sessilifolium and Eupatorium rotundifolium (although it reproduces by apomixis and thus can be found outside the range of the two parent species).

Denomination is a Ma'ah Reverse of a Yehud coin from the Persian era, with lily (symbol of Jerusalem) Persian administration in Jerusalem (4th century BCE). The coin shows a deity seated on a winged wheel, often interpreted as a depiction of Yahweh (Yahu). The Yehud coinage is a series of small silver coins bearing the Aramaic inscription Yehud.Rooke, Deborah W., \\"Zadok's heirs: the role and development of the High Priesthood in ancient Israel\\" (Oxford, 2000) p.225 They derive their name from the inscription YHD (ê§â‚Ä¨ê§Ñê§É‚Ä¨) , \\"Yehud\\", the Aramaic name of the Achaemenid Persian province of Yehud; others are inscribed YHDH, the same name in Hebrew. Date and origin The YHD coins are believed to date from the Persian period. On the other hand, it is possible that the YHDH coins are from the following Ptolemaic period. Mildenburg dates Yehud coins from the early 4th century BCE to the reign of Ptolemy I (312‚Äì285 BCE), while Meshorer believes there was a gap during Ptolemy I's time and that minting resumed during Ptolemy II and continued into Ptolemy III, although this has been questioned. The earlier coins were almost certainly produced in imitation of Athenian coins, and were used locally as small change to supplement the larger denominations from more centralised mints elsewhere in the region.Rooke, Deborah W., \\"Zadok's heirs: the role and development of the High Priesthood in ancient Israel\\", Clarendon Press, Oxford, 2000, pp. 225‚Äì6 A lot of these coins were probably minted in Jerusalem. The use of figural art Unlike later Jewish coinage, Yehud coins depict living creatures, flowers and even human beings. During the First Temple period figural art was frequently used, such as the cherubim over the Ark of the Covenant, the twelve oxen that supported the giant laver in front of Solomon's Temple, etc. Thus, it is likely that the Yehud coins are continuing the use of figural art from the previous period. The prohibition against graven images in Exodus was probably seen as relating only to idolatrous images rather than the purely decorative. Depictions on the coinage include imagery borrowed from other cultures, such as the Athenian Owl, and various mythological creatures. The lily flower was also commonly portrayed. Various human images are also portrayed. Some coins bear images of Persian rulers. The identity of other human images are not always clear; some of them may even be images of Jewish leaders, such as Temple priests.Lee I. Levine, Jerusalem: Portrait of the City in the Second Temple Period (538 B.C.E. ‚Äì 70 C.E.).

Carter Published by Continuum International Publishing Group, 1999 , pg269 Recent study by Yehoshua Zlotnik attempts to relate different kinds of coins, and the specifics of their manufacture to the changing political situation in Judea in the 4th century BCE. He deals with different coin-types, and with such unusual phenomena as minting on only one side of the coin, and seemingly deliberate flaws on certain dies. According to Zlotnik, these and other features can clarify the political state of affairs in Judah, such as independence, autonomy, or transition period.Yehoshua Zlotnik (2009), Coin minting in Eretz Israel during the Persian period ‚Äì does it reflect various political situations?

Helmeted head of Athena right / Owl standing right. In Judea, the olive sprig of the Athenian coin was replaced by the lily, and instead of the Greek \\"AŒòE\\" (Athens) the Hebrew letters 'y-h-d' were used (examples) According to Zlotnik, the first minting of ‚ÄúYehud‚Äù coins began around 400 BCE under the influence of the contemporary Egyptian revolts against Persia. These were small silver coins (obols) imitating the Athenian model -- the coins that were also quite common in Egypt at that time. Such coins were also the most commonly used coins in circulation in Philistia, Judea and Edom at this time.Yehoshua Zlotnik (2012), Minting of coins in Jerusalem during the Persian and Hellenistic periods. When the Persian reconquered the area after 360 BCE, they gave permission for further minting of similar silver coins under their own governors. This type of minting continued also under the Ptolemies.Yehoshua Zlotnik (2012), Minting of coins in Jerusalem during the Persian and Hellenistic periods. Mildenberg divides most of the Persian period 'Yehud' coinage into three groups: an early group of poorly defined coins with the head of Athena on the obverse with her owl on the reverse with the inscription 'y-h-d' in Paleo-Hebrew; the second group are more clearly defined and depict a lily, and an Egyptian falcon (see pictures), and the head of the Persian king, with the inscription 'y-h-d'; the third group has the Hebrew inscription 'Hezekiah the governor' (yhzqyh hphh). All these coins have been found in the area of Judea.A History of the Jews and Judaism in the Second Temple Period: Yehud, the Persian Province of Judah by Lester L. Grabbe Published by Continuum International Publishing Group, 2004 , pg 65 The Yehud coins come in two denominations, approximately .58 gram as a ma'ah and approximately .29 gram as a half ma'ah (chatzi ma'ah). These coins might have been minted in the first 40 years of the Second Temple era. For larger coinage, they first used Persian coinage, the Persian daric and the Sigloi; then Greek (Alexandrian Empire) coins like the drachma and the tetradrachm.

He was Speaker of the House of Commons from January 1689 to February 1689. He was also Master of the Rolls. Early life Born at Shottesbrook, Berkshire in 1630, he was second son of Henry Powle, who was sheriff for Berkshire in 1633, by his wife Katherine, daughter of Matthew Herbert of Monmouth. He matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 16 December 1646. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 11 May 1647, and became a barrister in 1654 and bencher in 1659. In April 1660 he was elected Member of Parliament for Cirencester in the Convention Parliament.History of Parliament Online - Powle, Henry Member of Parliament under Charles II On 3 January 1671, Powle was elected MP for Cirencester again in the Cavalier Parliament. At the time he held property at Williamstrop (or Williamstrip), Coln St. Aldwyns, Gloucestershire, or the neighbouring parish of Quenington, and was usually described as of the latter place. He first appeared in debate in February 1673, when he attacked Lord-chancellor Shaftesbury's practice of issuing writs for by-elections during the recess without the speaker's warrant. As a result of the debate all the elections were declared void, 6 February 1673. Subsequently, he opposed the Declaration of Indulgence, Charles II of England's measure of religious toleration, wishing disabilities for Catholics and dissenters to continue. Powle identified himself with the opponents of the court, and declined to support the king's claim to the dispensing power. He promoted the passing of the Test Act in March. In the new session in October Powle led the attack on the proposed marriage between the Duke of York and the Princess Mary of Modena, and the king at once directed a prorogation. But before the arrival of Black Rod to announce it, Powle's motion for an address was carried with little opposition. A week later another short session opened. Powle advised the withholding of supply till the grievances connected with Catholic favourites and a standing army were redressed, and he led the attack on the king's 'villainous councillors,‚Äô assailing in particular Anglesey and Lauderdale. Next year he denounced George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, and had a large share in driving him from office. In May 1677 he urged the wisdom of a Dutch alliance. When the Commons sent an address to the king dictating such an alliance on 4 February 1678, Charles indignantly summoned them to the banqueting-room at Whitehall Palace. After their return to the House Powle stood up, but Sir Edward Seymour, the Speaker, informed him that the house was adjourned by the king's pleasure. Powle insisted, and the Speaker sprang out of the chair and, after a struggle, got away. On their re- assembling five days later Powle declared that the whole liberty of the house was threatened by the Speaker's conduct. In May 1678, when Charles sent a message to the house to hasten supply, Powle once more insisted on the prior consideration of grievances. Powle supported the impeachment of Danby, but in the agitation of the Popish Plot he kept a low profile. Powle was returned for both Cirencester and East Grinstead, Sussex, in the First Exclusion Parliament, which met on 6 March 1679. He elected to represent Cirencester. Seymour, the speaker chosen by the commons, was declined by the king. Powle denied that the king had such power of refusal, and moved an address 'that we desire time to think of it.' During the discussion that followed, Powle himself was named as speaker, but was not allowed to proceed. Finally, Serjeant Gregory was elected. The new parliament pursued the attack on Danby. ‚ÄòLyttleton and Powle,‚Äô says Gilbert Burnet,ii. 82. 'led the matters of the House of Commons with the greatest dexterity and care.' Meanwhile, Paul Barillon, the French ambassador, who wanted to ruin Danby, had entered into correspondence with Powle and other leaders of the opposition. Powle, like Harbord and Lyttleton, finally accepted a pension from Barillon of five hundred guineas a year. After Danby's committal to the Tower of London and Charles's acceptance of Sir William Temple's abortive scheme of government by a new composite privy council of thirty members, Powle was, with four other commoners, admitted to the council on 21 April 1678. In the Second Exclusion Parliament, which was called for October 1679, Powle was returned for Cirencester. But parliament was prorogued from time to time without assembling, and Powle, acting on Shaftesbury's advice, retired from the council on 17 April. Parliament met at length in October 1680. Powle at once arraigned the conduct of the chief justice, William Scroggs, who had discharged the grand jury before they were able to consider Shaftesbury's indictment of the Duke of York. In the renewed debates on the Exclusion Bill Powle held back to keep relations open with the king, but in the proceedings of December 1680 against Lord Stafford, he took a vehement part. Although returned for East Grinstead to Charles's Oxford parliament (20 March 1681 and 28 March 1681), Powle took little further part in politics until the Glorious Revolution. Member of Parliament under William and Mary Powle was a member of the Royal Society, and was probably abroad for part of the time before the Glorious Revolution. He gained the confidence of William III, at that point the Prince of Orange, and on 16 December 1688 he and Sir Robert Howard held a long and private interview with the prince at Windsor. When William called together at St. James's a number of members of Charles II's parliaments and common councilmen, Powle attended at the head of 160 former members of the House of Commons. On their return to Westminster to consider the best method of calling a free parliament, he was chosen chairman. He bluntly asserted that 'the wish of the prince is sufficient warrant for our assembling;‚Äô and on the following morning he read addresses to William, praying that he would assume the administration and call a convention. To the Convention parliament Powle was returned, with Sir Christopher Wren, for Windsor and he was voted to the Speaker's chair over the head of his old opponent, Sir Edward Seymour (22 January 1689). Powle's speech on the opening of the convention exercised influence on subsequent debates. As Speaker, he congratulated William and Mary on their coronation, 13 April 1689, and presented to William the Bill of Rights on 16 December 1689. Powle was summoned, with seven other commoners, to William's first privy council, and, on the remodelling of the judicial bench, when John Holt was appointed justice of the king's bench and Sir Robert Atkyns chief baron, Powle, on 13 March 1690, received the patent of master of the rolls. While the convention sat, William relied on Powle's advice; he laid down his office at the dissolution of February 1690. Powle was returned for Cirencester for William's first parliament, which met on 20 March 1690, but was unseated on petition. Powle then devoted himself to his duties as master of the rolls, and successfully claimed, in accordance with precedent, a writ of summons to attend parliament as an assistant to the House of Lords. He spoke in the upper house in favour of the Abjuration Bill on 24 April 1690, but wished the oath imposed sparingly and only on office-holders. Death He died intestate on 21 November 1692, and was buried within the communion-rails of Quenington church, Gloucestershire, where a monument was erected to his memory. He is there described as master of the rolls and one of the judges delegates of the admiralty. Legacy Powle's historical, legal, and antiquarian knowledge was highly esteemed. With the aid of John Bagford, he formed a large library of manuscripts and records. A few of these now constitute the nucleus of the Lansdowne collection in the British Museum. Other portions were dispersed, and were for a time in the possession of Lord Somers, Sir Joseph Jekyll, and Philip, earl Hardwicke. Powle's arms were placed in the window of the Rolls chapel and also of Lincoln's Inn hall. Personal life Powle married, first, in 1659, Elizabeth, daughter of the first Lord Newport of High Ercall. She died on 28 July 1672, and was buried at Quenington. His second wife was Frances, a daughter of Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex, and widow of Richard Sackville, 5th Earl of Dorset. By his first wife he left an only child, Katharine, who married Henry, eldest son of Henry Ireton, conveying to him the estates of Quenington and Williamstrop. Powle was subsequently involved in lawsuits over the property of his second wife. Powle's brother Richard was M.P. for Berkshire in 1660‚Äì1, was knighted in 1661, and died in 1678. In 1676‚Äì7 Powle bought the estate of Ramsbury Manor, Wiltshire. He quickly sold most of the leaseholds and copyholds, and in 1681 sold the remainder, together with the manor house and its park and woods, to Sir William Jones.

The service allows users to post multimedia and other content to a short-form blog. Users can follow other users' blogs. Bloggers can also make their blogs private. For bloggers many of the website's features are accessed from a \\"dashboard\\" interface. As of August 12, 2019, Tumblr hosts over 475 million blogs. As of January 2016, the website had over 500 million monthly visitors, which dropped to less than 400 million by August 2019. History Development of Tumblr began in 2006 during a two-week gap between contracts at David Karp's software consulting company, Davidville (housed at Karp's former internship with producer-incubator Fred Seibert's Frederator Studios, which was located a block from Tumblr's current headquarters). Karp had been interested in tumblelogs (short-form blogs, hence the name Tumblr) for some time and was waiting for one of the established blogging platforms to introduce their own tumblelogging platform. As no one had done so after a year of waiting, Karp and developer Marco Arment began working on their own tumblelogging platform. Tumblr was launched in February 2007, and within two weeks the service had gained 75,000 users. Arment left the company in September 2010 to focus on Instapaper. In early June 2012, Tumblr featured its first major brand advertising campaign in conjunction with Adidas, who launched an official soccer Tumblr blog and bought placements on the user dashboard. This launch came only two months after Tumblr announced it would be moving towards paid advertising on its site. Original logo of Tumblr On May 20, 2013, it was announced that Yahoo and Tumblr had reached an agreement for Yahoo! Inc. to acquire Tumblr for $1.1 billion in cash.Yahoo to buy Tumblr for $1.1 billion: Report, CNN.com. Retrieved May 21, 2013. Many of Tumblr's users were unhappy with the news, causing some to start a petition, achieving nearly 170,000 signatures. David Karp remained CEO and the deal was finalized on June 20, 2013. Advertising sales goals were not met and in 2016 Yahoo wrote down $712 million of Tumblr's value. Verizon Communications acquired Yahoo in June 2017, and placed Yahoo and Tumblr under its Oath subsidiary. Karp announced in November 2017 that he would be leaving Tumblr by the end of the year. Jeff D'Onofrio, Tumblr's President and COO, took over leading the company. The site, along with the rest of the Oath division (renamed Verizon Media Group in 2019), continued to struggle under Verizon. In March 2019, SimilarWeb estimated Tumblr had lost 30% of its user traffic since December 2018, when the site had introduced a stricter content policy with heavier restrictions on adult content (which had been a notable draw to the service). In May 2019, it was reported that Verizon was considering selling the site due to its continued struggles since the purchase (as it had done with another Yahoo property, Flickr, via its sale to SmugMug). Following this news, Pornhub's vice president publicly expressed interest in purchasing Tumblr, with a promise to reinstate the previous adult content policies. On August 12, 2019, Verizon Media announced that it would sell Tumblr to Automattic‚Äîoperator of blog service WordPress.com and corporate backer of the open source blog software of the same name‚Äîfor an undisclosed amount. Axios reported that the sale price was less than $3 million, a significant decrease over Yahoo's original purchase price. Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg stated that the site will operate as a complementary service to WordPress.com, and that there were no plans to reverse the content policy decisions made during Verizon ownership. Features=Blog management * Dashboard: The dashboard is the primary tool for the typical Tumblr user. It is a live feed of recent posts from blogs that they follow. Through the dashboard, users are able to comment, reblog, and like posts from other blogs that appear on their dashboard. The dashboard allows the user to upload text posts, images, videos, quotes, or links to their blog with a click of a button displayed at the top of the dashboard. Users are also able to connect their blogs to their Twitter and Facebook accounts; so whenever they make a post, it will also be sent as a tweet and a status update. * Queue: Users are able to set up a schedule to delay posts that they make. They can spread their posts over several hours or even days. * Tags: Users can help their audience find posts about certain topics by adding tags. If someone were to upload a picture to their blog and wanted their viewers to find pictures, they would add the tag #picture, and their viewers could use that word to search for posts with the tag #picture. * HTML editing: Tumblr allows users to edit their blog's theme HTML coding to control the appearance of their blog. Users are also able to use a custom domain name for their blog. Mobile With Tumblr's 2009 acquisition of Tumblerette, an iOS application created by Jeff Rock and Garrett Ross, the service launched its official iPhone app. The site became available to BlackBerry smartphones on April 17, 2010, via a Mobelux application in BlackBerry World. In June 2012, Tumblr released a new version of its iOS app, Tumblr 3.0, allowing support for Spotify, hi-res images and offline access. An app for Android is also available. A Windows Phone app was released on April 23, 2013. An app for Google Glass was released on May 16, 2013.  Inbox and messaging  Tumblr blogs may optionally allow users to submit questions, either as themselves or anonymously, to the blog for a response. Tumblr also offered a \\"fan mail\\" function, allowing users to send messages to blogs that they follow. On November 10, 2015, Tumblr introduced an integrated instant messaging function, allowing users to chat with other Tumblr users. The feature was rolled out in a \\"viral\\" manner; it was initially made available to a group of 1500 users, and other users could receive access to the messaging system if they were sent a message by any user that had received access to the system itself. The messaging platform replaces the fan mail system, which was deprecated. The ability to send posts to others via the Dashboard was added the following month. In November 2019, Tumblr introduced \\"group chats\\"‚Äîephemeral chat rooms surfaced via searches, designed to allow users to share content in real-time with users who share their interests. Posts disappear after 24 hours and cannot be edited. Original content In May 2012, Tumblr launched Storyboard, a blog managed by an in-house editorial team which features stories and videos about noteworthy blogs and users on Tumblr. In April 2013, Storyboard was shut down. In March 2018, Tumblr began to syndicate original video content from Verizon-owned video network go90, as part of an ongoing integration of Oath properties, and reported plans to wind down go90 in favor of using Oath properties to distribute its content instead. This made the respective content available internationally, since go90 is a U.S.-only service. Usage information screen in a Dutch train station, 2019 Tumblr has been noted for the socially progressive views of its users. In 2011, the service was most popular with the teen and college-aged user segments with half of Tumblr's visitor base being under the age of 25. In April 2013, the website received more than 13 billion global page views. User activity, measured by the number of blog posts each day, peaked at over 100 million in early 2014 and declined in each of the next three years, to approximately 30 million by October 2018. As of May 2019, Tumblr hosts over 465 million blogs and more than 172 billion posts in total with over 21 million posts created on the site each day.  Adult content  Tumblr has been noted by technology journalists as having had a sizable amount of pornographic content. An analysis conducted by news and technology site TechCrunch on May 20, 2013, has shown that over 22% of all traffic in and out of Tumblr was classified as pornography. In addition, a reported 16.45% of blogs on Tumblr exclusively contained pornographic material. Since July 2013 and its acquisition by Yahoo, Tumblr has progressively restricted adult content on the site. In July 2013, Tumblr began to filter content from adult- tagged blogs from appearing in search results and tag displays unless the user is logged in. In February 2018, Safe Mode (which filters \\"sensitive\\" content and blogs) became enabled by default for all users on an opt-out basis. On December 3, 2018, Tumblr announced that effective December 17, all images and videos depicting sex acts, and real-life images and videos depicting human genitalia or \\"female-presenting\\" nipples, would be banned from the service. Exceptions are provided for illustrations or art that depict nudity, nudity related to \\"political or newsworthy speech\\", and depictions of \\"female- presenting\\" nipples in relation to medical events such as childbirth, breastfeeding, mastectomy and gender reassignment surgery. The rules do not apply to text content. All posts in violation of the policy are hidden from public view, and repeat offenders may be reprimanded. Shortly prior to the announcement, Tumblr's Android app was patched to remove the ability to disable Safe Mode. The change has faced wide criticism among Tumblr's community; in particular, it has been argued that the service should have focused on other major issues (such as controlling hate speech or the number of porn-related spambots on the service), and that the service's adult community provided a platform for sex education, independent adult performers (especially those representing LGBT communities who feel that they are underrepresented by a heteronormative mainstream industry) seeking an outlet for their work, and those seeking a safe haven from \\"over-policed\\" platforms to share creative work with adult themes. Tumblr stated that it is using various algorithms to detect potential violations, in combination with manual reviews. Users quickly discovered a wide array of false positives. A large number of users scheduled protest actions on December 17th. On the day the ban took effect, Tumblr issued a new post clarifying the new policy, showcasing examples of adult images still allowed on the service, and stating that it \\"fully recognized\\" its \\"special obligation\\" to serving its LGBT userbase, and that \\"LGBTQ+ conversations, exploration of sexuality and gender, efforts to document the lives and challenges of those in the sex worker industry, and posts with pictures, videos, and GIFs of gender-confirmation surgery are all examples of content that is not only permitted on Tumblr but actively encouraged.\\" Wired cited multiple potential factors in the ban, including that the presence of adult content made the service unappealing to potential advertisers, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (a U.S. federal law which makes websites liable for knowingly assisting or facilitating illegal sex trafficking), as well as heavy restrictions on adult content imposed by Apple for software offered on the iOS App Store (which similarly prompted several Reddit clients to heavily frustrate the ability for users to access forums on the site that contain adult content). Corporate affairs Tumblr's headquarters are located in the 770 Broadway building in New York City. Tumblr's headquarters is at 770 Broadway in New York City. The company also maintains a support office in Richmond, Virginia. As of June 1, 2017, Tumblr had 411 employees. The company's logo is set in Bookman Old Style with some modifications. Funding Tumblr had received about $125 million of funding from investors. The company has raised funding from Union Square Ventures, Spark Capital, Mart√≠n Varsavsky, John Borthwick (Betaworks), Fred Seibert, Krum Capital, and Sequoia Capital (among other investors).Anthony Ha, VentureBeat. \\"Blog startup Tumblr goes bi-coastal with Sequoia Investment.\\" November 12, 2010. In its first round of funding in October 2007, Tumblr raised $750,000 from Spark Capital and Union Square Ventures. In December 2008 the company raised $4.5 million in Series B funding and a further $5 million in April 2010. In December 2010 Tumblr raised $30 million in Series D funding. The company had an $800 million valuation in August 2011. In September 2011 the company raised $85 million in a round of funding led by Greylock Partners and Insight Venture Partners. Revenue sources In an interview with Nicole Lapin of Bloomberg West on September 7, 2012, David Karp said the site was monetized by advertising. Their first advertising launch started in May 2012 after 16 experimental campaigns. Tumblr made $13 million in revenue in 2012 and hoped to make $100 million in 2013. Tumblr reportedly spent $25 million to fund operations in 2012. In 2013, Tumblr began allowing companies to pay to promote their own posts to a larger audience. Tumblr Head of Sales, Lee Brown, has quoted the average ad purchase on Tumblr to be nearly six figures. Tumblr also allows premium theme templates to be sold for use by blogs. In July 2016, advertisements were implemented by default across all blogs. Users may opt-out, and the service stated that a revenue sharing program would be implemented at a later date. Criticism= Copyright issues  Tumblr has received criticism for copyright violations by participating bloggers; however, Tumblr accepts Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) take-down notices. Tumblr's visual appeal has made it ideal for photoblogs that often include copyrighted works from others that are re- published without payment. Tumblr users can post unoriginal content by \\"Reblogging\\", a feature on Tumblr that allows users to re-post content taken from another blog onto their own blog with attribution.  Security  Tumblr has been forced to manage spam and security problems. For example, a chain letter scam in May 2011 affected 130,000 users. On December 3, 2012, Tumblr was attacked by a cross-site scripting worm deployed by the Internet troll group Gay Nigger Association of America. The message urged users to harm themselves and criticized blogging in general.  User interface changes  In 2015, Tumblr faced criticism by users for changes to its reblog mechanisms. In July 2015, the system was modified so that users cannot remove or edit individual comments by other users when reblogging a post; existing comments can only be removed all at once. Tumblr staff argued that the change was intended to combat \\"misattribution\\", though this move was met by criticism from ‚Äòask blogs‚Äô and ‚ÄòRP blogs‚Äô, which often shortened long chains of reblogs between users to improve readability. In September 2015, Tumblr changed how threads of comments on reblogged posts are displayed; rather than a nested view with indentations for each post, all reblogs are now shown in a flat view, and user avatars were also added. The change was intended to improve the legibility of reblogs, especially on mobile platforms, and complements the inability to edit existing comments. Although some users had requested such a change to combat posts made illegible by extremely large numbers of comments on a reblogged post, the majority of users (even those who had requested such a change) criticized the new format. The Verge was also critical of the changes, noting that it was cleaner, but made the site lose its \\"nostalgic charm\\".  Userbase behaviour  While Tumblr's userbase has generally been received as accommodating people from a wide range of ideologies and identities, a common point of criticism is that attitudes from users on the site stifle discussion and discourse. In addition, several incidents involving serious behaviour from the userbase have been publicised in recent years; these include the ‚ÄòIndependence Day raid‚Äô in 2014, in which users of Tumblr attempted to raid 4chan, only for the raid to backfire when 4chan retaliated, as well as an incident in 2015, in which members of the Steven Universe fandom drove an artist to the point of attempting suicide over their artwork, in which they drew characters thin that are typically seen as being 'fat' in the show. In 2018, Kotaku reporter Gita Jackson described the site as a 'joyless black hole', citing how the website's design and functionality led to 'fandoms spinning out of control', as well as an environment which inhibited discussion and discourse. Promotion of self-harm and suicide In February 2012, Tumblr banned blogs that promote or advocate suicide, self-harm and eating disorders (pro-ana). The suicide of a British teenager, Tallulah Wilson, raised the issue of suicide and self-harm promotion on Tumblr as Wilson was reported to have maintained a self-harm blog on the site. A user on the site is reported to have sent Wilson an image of a noose accompanied by the message: \\"here is your new necklace, try it on.\\" In response to the Wilson case, Maria Miller, the UK's minister for culture, media, and sport, said that social media sites like Tumblr need to remove \\"toxic\\" self-harm content. Searching terms like \\"depression\\", \\"anxiety\\", and \\"suicide\\" on Tumblr now brings up a PSA page directing the user to resources like the national suicide lifeline, and 7 Cups; as well as an option to continue to the search results. There are concerns of some Tumblr posts glorifying suicide and depression among young people.Becker, Mayer, Nagenborg, El-Faddagh, & Schmidt, 2004; Duggan, Heath, Lewis, & Baxter, 2012; Lewis, Heath, St. Denis, & Noble, 2011; Mitchell & Ybarra, 2007; Whitlock, Powers, & Eckenrode, 2006 Politics In February 2018, BuzzFeed published a report claiming that Tumblr was utilized as a distribution channel for Russian agents to influence American voting habits during the 2016 presidential election. Despite policies forbidding hate speech, Tumblr has been noted for hosting content from Nazis and white supremacists. In May 2020, Tumblr announced that it will remove reblogs of terminated hate speech posts, specifically Nazi and white supremacist content.https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21247437/tumblr-hate-speech-reblog- removal-nazis-white-supremacist-content  Censorship  Several countries have blocked access to Tumblr because of pornography, religious extremism or LGBT content. These countries include China, Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Iran. In February 2016, the Indonesian government temporarily blocked access to Tumblr within the country because the site hosts pages that carried porn. The government shortly reversed its decision to block the site and said it had asked Tumblr to self-censor its pornographic content. = Adult content ban = In November 2018, Tumblr's iOS app was removed by Apple from its App Store after illegal child pornography images were found on the service. Tumblr stated that all images uploaded to the service are scanned against an industry database, but that a \\"routine audit\\" had revealed images that had not yet been added to the database. In the wake of the incident, a number of Tumblr blogs‚Äîparticularly those dealing primarily in adult-tagged artwork such as erotica, as well as art study and anatomy resources‚Äîwere also deleted, with affected users taking to other platforms (such as Twitter) to warn others and complain about the deletions, as well as encourage users to back up their blog's contents. Tumblr subsequently removed the ability to disable \\"Safe Mode\\" from its Android app, and announced a wider ban on explicit images of sex acts and nudity on the platform with certain limited exceptions. Tumblr decided to use an automatic content recognition system which resulted in many non-pornographic images being removed from the platform.  Recognition  In August 2010, Tumblr was named as a finalist in Lead411's New York City Hot 125.  Notable users  Celebrities who use Tumblr include Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, Zooey Deschanel, John Mayer and Zayn. On October 21, 2011, Tumblr became the first blogging platform to host Barack Obama's blog.

Fought between the Donghak Korean peasants and the combined Japanese-Joseon Army, it resulted in the decline of the Donghak Rebellion and the growth of Japanese Imperialism in Korea.  Background  As the Korean government had difficulty in suppressing the Donghak movement, an emissary was sent to the Qing empire to request an immediate troop dispatch. The Qing court replied by sending the necessary soldiers. Japan also sent troops on the pretext of protecting Japanese citizens in Korea. As the Chinese and Japanese armies poured into the peninsula, Jeon Bong-jun, the leader of Donghak peasants, rallied the Korean peasants and led them to once rebel against the Joseon court and drive out the foreign \\"devils\\".  Battle  In the early stage of the battle, the peasant force gained early successes against the Joseon army. However, they began to retire when the Japanese troops arrived to reinforce the government forces. When the Donghak army advanced the second time, the Japanese, armed with modern Murata rifles and artillery, easily defeated peasants, armed only with bamboo spears and outdated matchlocks. As the peasant casualties mounted, Jeon ordered a retreat and the Donghak army scattered.  Aftermath  After the battle, Donghak peasants fled south and battled in the consequent Battle of Taein. After defeat in Gumiran, Jeon Bongjun ordered the Donghak peasants to scatter. Jeon himself was hanged in March, 1895.

From 1918 until their merger into the Deutsche Reichsbahn the title 'Royal' was dropped and they were just called the Saxon State Railways (S√§chsische Staatseisenbahnen).  History  Railway network of the Royal Saxon State Railways (1902)  En route to a state railway  After the completion of the privately financed Leipzig‚ÄìDresden railway in 1839, the Saxon parliament also began to get involved in railway construction. Early on it was recognised that railway lines to Bavaria, Bohemia and Silesia were needed and that there ought to be a route running north-to-south through the kingdom. The funding of this plan lay in the hands of privately financed railway committees. The state, however, saw itself arranging for the corresponding political and legal hurdles to be cleared. On 14 January 1841 a treaty was agreed with the Kingdom of Bavaria and the Duchy of Saxony-Altenburg for the construction of a railway route between Leipzig and Hof. On 22 June 1841, the Saxon-Bavarian Railway Company was founded and on 19 September 1842 railway services between Leipzig and Altenburg station were opened. Because the construction costs exceeded the planned limits, the state had to jump in and honour its previously made promise to complete the construction at the national expense. On 1 April 1847 the railway line, which was finished as far as Reichenbach im Vogtland was transferred to state ownership. At the same time the Royal Saxon-Bavarian State Railway Division (K√∂niglichen Direction der S√§chsisch-Bayerischen Staatseisenbahn) in Leipzig began work. Specific regulations were laid down by the state parliament. The board of directors was accordingly given the appropriate powers and was assigned directly to a state ministry. The payroll of the officials was to be approved by the state parliament and railway fares by the provincial legislature. In addition to funding for the construction of the line, in particular the G√∂ltzsch Viaduct and Elster Viaduct, agreements had to be reached with Saxony-Altenburg and Bavaria over owning and operating relationships. On 15 July 1851, the line to Hof (Saale) was completed. Because no suitable private company had been found to build the Saxony-Bohemian Railway from Dresden to Bodenbach, the state took over this task itself. On the opening of the section from Dresden to Pirna on 1 August 1848, Saxony had its second state railway line, for which the 'Royal Division for the Construction and Operation of the Saxony-Bohemia Railway' (K√∂nigliche Direction f√ºr Bau und Betrieb der S√§chsisch-B√∂hmischen Staatseisenbahn) was established, with a head office in Dresden. On 24 July 1843 a treaty was concluded with the Kingdom of Prussia for the construction of a railway route from Dresden via Bautzen to the Prussia towns of G√∂rlitz and Bunzlau. That made it possible to put in the important link to Breslau. On 1 September 1847, the 102 km long route from Dresden to G√∂rlitz was opened by the Saxon-Silesian Railway (S√§chsisch-Schlesische Eisenbahn), a private company that had formed with state support. On 31 January 1851 this company was transferred to state ownership. At the same time the running powers of the private L√∂bau-Zittau Railway Company (L√∂bau-Zittauer Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) were taken over. By combining the management of the two lines radiating from Dresden savings were supposed to be made. Thus, the 'Royal Division of Saxon-Bohemian and Saxon- Silesian State Railways in Dresden (K√∂nigliche Direction der S√§chsisch- B√∂hmischen und S√§chsisch-Schlesischen Staatseisenbahnen in Dresden) was formed, which on 14 December 1852 was thankfully renamed to the rather more succinct 'Royal Dresden State Railway Division' (K√∂nigliche Staatseisenbahn- Direction zu Dresden). On 1 October 1853 the 'Royal Chemnitz-Riesa State Railway Division' (K√∂nigliche Direktion der Chemnitzer-Riesaer Staatseisenbahn) was established. It had the task of completing the construction of the Riesa‚ÄìChemnitz railway and running the line subsequently. This had been necessary, after the private firm, the Chemnitz-Riesa Railway Company, had gone bankrupt due to the cost of structures needed between Waldheim und D√∂beln. Unlike Prussia, Saxony never issued a railway law. This meant that every railway proposal had to be agreed in the state parliament. In spite of the negative experiences of the past, the next ten years saw an increase in the construction of state railways. The work was not without problems, due to geographical difficulties. The extension of the route between Chemnitz and Riesa as well as the line from Freiberg to Tharandt were technically challenging and correspondingly expensive. On 15 November 1858 the line from Chemnitz to Zwickau was completed. That meant there was now a link from Riesa to the Saxon-Bavarian Railway over the line from Zwickau that had been built in 1845. As a result, the Chemnitz Division was disbanded and the management of its routes transferred to the Leipzig Division, which was given the title of \\"Royal Division of the State's Western Railways\\" (K√∂nigliche Direktion der westlichen Staatseisenbahn). At the same time the Dresden Division was renamed the \\"Royal Division of the State's Eastern Railways\\" (K√∂nigliche Direktion der √∂stlichen Staatseisenbahnen). In 1862 the state railways had an overall length of 525 km. In addition to the Leipzig-Dresden Railway, there were now private coal railways in the Saxon coal regions of Zwickau and D√∂hlen, as well as the Zittau-Reichenberg Railway. The state however had an 11/12 stake in the latter. By 1865 links from Leipzig to Corbetha and Bitterfeld, and hence connexions to Magdeburg and Berlin, were established as well as the Voigtl√§nd State Railway (Herlasgr√ºn‚ÄìEger). Locomotives during the 'locomotive escape' in 1866 at Eger station One crucial event in the history of Saxon railway operations turned out to be the Austro- Prussian War of 1866 between Prussia and Austria. Because Saxony was on the Austrian side, it evacuated all the locomotives to Hof, Eger and Budapest when Prussian troops invaded. During the course of the war the Ostrau Viaduct and the bridge over the Elbe at Riesa were destroyed. In the subsequent peace treaty, Prussia was given ownership of those sections of the Silesian Railway that ran through its territory as well as G√∂rlitz station. A Prussian route from Leipzig to Zeitz also had to be permitted. In the following years the railway network was further expanded. Lines in the upper Ore Mountains appeared after Schwarzenberg/Erzgeb. was given a railway connexion in 1858. In 1866, the railway to Annaberg-Buchholz joined the network and the line to Weipert followed in 1872. The most important reason was the transportation of brown coal from the north Bohemian basin. In 1869 the gap between Fl√∂ha and Freiberg was finally closed and the two networks joined together. As a result, on 1 July 1869, the Leipzig and Dresden divisions were merged into the new \\"Royal General Division of the Saxon State Railways\\" (K√∂niglichen Generaldirection der s√§chsischen Staatseisenbahnen), abbreviated to K. S√§chs. Sts. E. B. ‚Äú, in Dresden. One of the managing directors of the Saxon state railways was the privy councillor, Otto von Tschirschky and B√∂gendorff, the father-in-law of the later General Paul von der Planitz.  Further expansion  The years after the foundation of the Reich in 1871 were also marked, in Saxony, by a large number of private railway construction projects. However, in most cases the state had to come to their aid in order to complete the planned routes and to continue to run them. In addition, further building work was carried out in order to expand the network. The construction of railways made it possible to site industry even in the villages of the Ore Mountains and the Lausitz and to foster under-developed regions. On 1 July 1876 the state took over the Leipzig-Dresden railway and thereby increased the network length by 337.5 km. Subsequently, almost all remaining private railway companies in Saxony were taken over in order to be ready for a planned Reich railway project under Prussian leadership. Development of the railway network and the locomotive fleet Because the construction and operations of lines was not always covered by the profits, ways to simplify things began to be investigated. As early as 1865 the engineer's forum of the Union of German Railway Administrations (Verein Deutscher Eisenbahnverwaltungen) set out principles for secondary lines. These were legally implemented in 1878 as part of the 'Railway Regulations for German Railways of Lower Importance' (Bahnordnung f√ºr deutsche Eisenbahnen untergeordneter Bedeutung). The routes built to these simpler regulations were known in Saxony as 'secondary lines' or Sekund√§rbahnen (Singular: Sekund√§rbahn). Twenty-six routes totalling 453 km were immediately run as Sekund√§rbahnen and in 1879 the first newly built Sekund√§rbahn, the suburban route from Leipzig to Gaschwitz via Plagwitz. Because even Sekund√§rbahnen did not produce the desired savings in every case, in 1881 the construction of the first narrow gauge railways began. On 17 October 1881 the section of line between Wilkau and Kirchberg (Sachsen) was opened. By 1920 Saxon narrow gauge railways had a total length of 519.88 km. The most important railway structures were the Dresden Hauptbahnhof built from 1891 to 1901 and the Leipzig Hauptbahnhof which was finished in 1915. Both were linked to the cities with extensive modifications to the railway yards. On the abdication of King Friedrich August III in 1918 and the transformation of the kingdom to a free state, the appellation 'Royal' (K√∂niglich) was dropped and the railway administration in Saxony called itself the 'Saxon State Railways' (S√§chsische Staatseisenbahnen or S√§chs. Sts. E.B.). The Saxon State Railways brought 3370 km of track into the Deutsche Reichsbahn network in 1920.  Railway network  The railway network included, for one, the north‚Äìsouth links from Leipzig via Plauen to Hof, from Riesa to Chemnitz and from Elsterwerda to Dresden and Sch√∂na as well as the east-west links from Plauen via Chemnitz to Dresden, from Leipzig to Dresden and from Dresden to G√∂rlitz. The industrialised Ore Mountains were especially well linked by several stub lines along the river valleys. In places these routes crossed the watershed of the Ore Mountains and joined up with the Bohemian railway network. An overview of the individual routes may be found in the German List of railway lines in Saxony. In the animation, you can see the extensions of the rail network from 1840 .  Motive power = Steam locomotives  The first locomotives that were procured were from proven classes built in England. These were four-coupled 0-4-0 steam locomotives and, later, 2-4-0 machines. To begin with even locomotives with a 2-2-2 wheel arrangement were procured. These classes were deployed on the main lines for a relatively long time; it was not until 1870 that 4-4-0 locomotives (Saxon K II, later K VIII) entered service. On branch lines and in shunting services the four-couplers were the main form of motive power for even longer. From the early 1890s locomotives with six coupled wheels were acquired. From that time, locomotives began to be matched more closely to their various tasks (goods, passenger and express train duties). Even the different route profiles (flat in the north and northeast, hilly in the south and southwest) led to increasingly different designs. From the turn of the century faster and faster classes were introduced. After the 4-6-0 locomotives followed classes with 4-6-2 (XVIII H) and 2-8-2 (XX HV) arrangements for express train services; 2-6-2 (XIV HT) for local traffic and 2-8-0 (IX H) and E (IX V and XI HT) for goods train duties. The development of narrow gauge locomotives was not so focussed. After the six-coupler Saxon I K, followed two designs that were unconvincing. Not until 1892 with the introduction of the 0-4-4-0 Meyer locomotive, the Saxon IV K was a design produced that was to form the backbone of the Saxon narrow gauge fleet for decades. With the appearance of the Saxon VI K in 1918 the final successful design was submitted. Whislst the private Leipzig-Dresden Railway bought its engines from several German locomotive manufacturers, the state locomotives were almost exclusively developed and supplied by the Chemnitz- based S√§chsischen Maschinenfabrik locomotive factory.  Railcars  Railcars were only used in limited numbers on Saxon railways. The only regular and long-lasting use of railcars were the electric units on the Klingenthal‚ÄìSachsenberg-Georgenthal narrow gauge line. There were trials with steam railcars, accumulator cars and combustion-engined railbuses. Employed for a long time from 1883 were three Thomas steam railbuses. Two diesel- electrics purchased in 1915 proved themselves well in practice, but were sold to Switzerland after the First World War. An overview of the individual locomotive classes is given in the List of Saxon locomotives and railbuses.  Wagons = Coaches  Goods wagons  In addition to their own designs, Saxony also used only slightly modified Prussian goods wagon designs. After the foundation of the German State Railway Wagon Association in 1909 the standardised goods wagons were procured, that were defined in 11 goods wagon templates.

Vladimir Baranoff Rossin√© started working on the instrument in 1916. He performed with it at many events and places, including the Bolshoi Theatre (1924). His wife used to help him in those performances. The Optophonic Piano generated sounds and projected revolving patterns onto a wall or ceiling by directing a bright light through a series of revolving painted glass disks (painted by Vladimir Baranoff Rossin√© himself), filters, mirrors and lenses. The keyboard controlled the combination of the various filters and disks. The variations in opacity of the painted disk and filters were picked up by a photo-electric cell controlling the pitch of a single oscillator. The instrument produced a continuous varying tone which, accompanied by the rotating Kaleidoscopic projections was used by Vladimir Baranoff Rossin√© at exhibitions and public events.

The island may have been sacred to the main Saxon god, Woden, as \\"Wodenes-Eye\\" (\\"Woden‚Äôs Isle\\"). Location It lies immediately east of the village of Cookham and south of the River Thames, and is located approximately North of Maidenhead. It is also very close to Cookham Lock. The Cliveden Estate is directly across the Thames from Odney, and in autumn the entire valley surrounding the two estates experiences a burst in vibrant autumn colour. Pottery There was the Odney Pottery works (1942‚Äì1956) on the common. The building can still be seen. The very attractive earthenware pottery is still sought after. John Bew was asked to set up the pottery by John Lewis in Cookham in 1942 to train disabled people. In 1948, they were given a government licence to produce domestic pottery. Geoffrey Eastop (1921‚Äì2014) spent a year working at the pottery early in his career as a potter. Lullebrook Manor and the Odney Club The Odney Club, a hotel and conference centre owned by the John Lewis Partnership and available for the use of its Partners (staff), is centred on Lullebrook Manor. This fine mid-18th century country house was once rented by Colonel Francis Ricardo, the first car owner in Cookham, who was High Sheriff of Berkshire in the early 1900s and supposedly the inspiration for Kenneth Grahame's Toad, in the Wind in the Willows.

It has been the most watched news program in the Eastern Visayas. It is currently aired online via its official Facebook page, ABS-CBN Regional's YouTube channel and iWant. It also produces its bulletin version News Patrol Eastern Visayas airing several times a day every weekdays. It is aired live daily from the ABS-CBN Newscenter in Tacloban at 5:00 PM, from Monday to Friday. It is simulcast over ABS-CBN TV-7 Catbalogan, and TV-10 Calbayog, and on radio via MOR 94.3 Tacloban For Life! TV Patrol Eastern Visayas has been covering the latest in-depth news from all over the Eastern Visayas in Waray, the major language of the region. Its area of coverage goes as far as Biliran and Samar, Leyte's neighboring islands. Cebuano was spoken by the interviewees in Western parts of Leyte and Southern Leyte. History=As TV Patrol Tacloban Final logo as TV Patrol Tacloban from October 7, 2013 to September 7, 2018 First aired on April 13, 1998 after the launching of the originating station in 1997, TV Patrol Tacloban has been running for more than 20 years, with its original anchor Bob Abellanosa, and later by Clifford Nolido, who since transferred to ABS-CBN Iloilo as its Station Manager. Nolido has been replaced by his former sit-in anchor Ranulfo Docdocan when he took over in 2013. The newscast is the only regional news program to air in the Waray language. On November 7, 2013, the program temporarily suspended airings for the first time in 6 weeks after Tacloban City was hit by Typhoon Yolanda on November 8 the following day, which damaged the broadcast equipment of ABS-CBN Tacloban. The program returned to broadcast on December 23, 2013 after power was restored in the city, repairs were completed in the station, and main anchor Docdocan recovered from injuries covering the typhoon in Guiuan, Eastern Samar. As of September 12, 2017, TV Patrol Tacloban had been the remaining regional TV Patrol that currently uses the 2013 version of the logo, OBB, and graphics package of the national newscast (the other is TV Patrol Bicol), as most of its regional counterparts have updated to the current package that has been used since July 4, 2016. The newscast aired its final telecast on September 7, 2018. As TV Patrol Eastern Visayas After 20 years as TV Patrol Tacloban the newscast was officially relaunched as TV Patrol Eastern Visayas starting Monday, September 10, 2018. The new branding thus expands its reach to cover news stories and features from all over the Samar and Leyte provinces, as well as in Biliran. Alongside the rebrand came a new OBB sequence, similar to the other editions and using the current national graphics package just like the other stations. A new studio was also unveiled following the launching of the newly-renovated offices of ABS-CBN Tacloban. The rebrand and expansion was made possible in the midst of ABS-CBN's cost-cutting measures to its regional content that saw parts of Luzon and Mindanao either merged or axed its newscasts after June 2018. After over a year later since its relaunch and broadcasting in Standard Definition (480i, 4:3 SDTV) format, TV Patrol Eastern Visayas finally switched to anamorphic widescreen 16:9 format starting on October 1, 2019. This marks the first time a regional TV Patrol newscast begun broadcasting in widescreen but sometimes will switch back to 4:3. The newscast temporarily suspended airings for the second time from May 5 until May 7, 2020, as a result of the cease and desist order of the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to stop the broadcasting operations of ABS-CBN, but the newscast resumed on May 8, 2020 via Facebook's live streaming platform Facebook Live. The newscast aired its final episode on August 28, 2020 as a result of retrenchments after bills for the renewal of ABS-CBN's franchise was denied by the Congress of the Philippines.

Early history Early on, the area around Bellfountain was known as Belknap's Settlement. A post office was established in 1895 called Dusty. The community's name was later changed to Bellfountain. It was said to be named for Bellefontaine, Ohio. From 1902 to 1905, a Bellfountain post office existed.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"Bellfountain\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press: Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 70. After 1905, local residents received their mail in Monroe. Bellfountain has also been said to have been named for the bell fountain, a natural spring that bubbled up about 1 mile west of Bellfountain where the Bellfountain Park is located. Flat rocks surrounding the natural artesian spring formed in the shape of a bell. People could view the bell fountain until sometime during the last 40 years when Benton County covered over the bell fountain with a cement building and a pump house to pump the water for use in the park. People are no longer able to view the bell fountain for which some people believe the town was named. State Champion School In 1937 the basketball team at Bellfountain High School won the Oregon state championship. At this time Kenneth Litchfield was principal and Burton \\"Bill\\" Lemmon was the coach. That was an era when all schools, large and small, were grouped together for playoff purposes. Bellfountain H.S. had a total of twenty-seven students, and their basketball team consisted of eight boys, none over 6 feet tall. After taking the Class B Championship they beat Portland's Franklin High School (a school of 2100 students) in the semi-finals, then competed in the finals against Portland's Lincoln High School. The Bells beat Lincoln by 14 points - their closest game of the season.Blakely, Joe R., The Bellfountain Giant Killers: The Story of a Small Oregon High School and its Miraculous Championship Season, Bear Creek Press, Enterprise, Oregon, 2003.

The people of Benton County have been using Bellfountain Park for over 100 years. The park has a large barbeque pit, softball field, sand volleyball court, horseshoe pits, and restrooms.

It was raised by the 2nd Duke of Kingston, ranked as the 10th Horse, and offered for service in the Jacobite rising of 1745, where it fought at Culloden. Since they were newly raised and the troopers weren't regulars they behaved in a less disciplined manner, especially in the pursuit after Culloden when they cut down some innocent civilians including women and children along the Inverness road, while pursuing the retreating Jacobites. The men had enlisted for the duration of the fighting, and so the regiment was disbanded at Nottingham in September 1746, with the Duke of Cumberland enlisting most of the men (all but eight of the original) into the newly formed Duke of Cumberland's Regiment of Light Dragoons.

The settlement lies south of the M4 motorway, and is located approximately north-west of Newbury. Located at the top of a hill above Boxford, the hamlet has views over the Lambourn Valley. Archaeology A Roman road Ermin Street that linked Corinium Dobunnorum (Cirencester) and Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester) ran from southeast to northwest through Ownham. It is no longer accessible but is visible from aerial archaeology near William's Copse. Early man was drawn to settle here because of the clear water supply and river ford in Boxford. Neolithic flints have been found in Ownham. Social and economic history Ownham (which has seven dwellings) is formed by a triangle of three historic farmhouses: Ownham Farm (also known as Upper Farm), Old Farm (also known as Ownham Old Farmhouse) and Lower Farm. Other notable historic buildings are a farm tenant's thatched cottage, a chapel of ease and a merchant house. All buildings are now residential. Two of the buildings in Ownham are Grade II listed. The road through Ownham does not have a name and most dwelling addresses are three digit numbers corresponding to historic farm plot numbers (\\"xxx Ownham\\"). Much of the surrounding farmland is part of Sir Richard Sutton's Settled Estates. The 6,500-acre property is given over to a variety of arable crops including wheat, barley, peas and beans, as well as a beef herd and sheep. The area around Ownham has a higher proportion of forestry than elsewhere in the Parish. On 12 June 2016 a civic street ceremony and party took place in Ownham to celebrate the Queen's 90th birthday. Transport Ownham lies on an unnamed road between Coombesbury Lane and Lambourn Road with a short no through road spur. The unnamed road was resurfaced in August 2013 by West Berkshire council. Before the resurfacing the unnamed road was one continuous road with the spur giving right of way. At the end of the works road markings were applied that made the spur and the lower part of the unnamed road one continuous road. The upper part of the unnamed road which runs from Coombesbury Lane now gives right of way at the spur. The change in road layout is likely to be a mistake as no record of a planned change exists. Ownham has two footpaths that historically were functional rights of way for the farming community. One footpath (Boxford Parish Path 14) links Ownham to the Wickham Heath bus stop for route 4 Newbury to Lambourn. The other footpath (Boxford Parish Path 17) runs from the heart of Ownham to an isolated section of the B4000.

He became professor of Slavic ethnography and dialectology and history of the Bulgarian language, since 1893 head of the Bulgarian and Slavic literature department of the High Pedagogical School (the future Sofia University). On 29 January 1889, he was elected the first rector of the university and reelected several times (1896‚Äì1897, 1902‚Äì1903); he was also dean of the Faculty of History and Philosophy (1899‚Äì1900, 1904‚Äì1905). In the late 19th and early 20th century, he was secretary of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, and from 1939 on he was doctor honoris causa of the Sofia University, as well as an active member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. From 1907 to 1910 he was also the head secretary of the Bulgarian Exarchate. Aleksandar Teodorov-Balan was also among the founders of the tourist movement in Bulgaria, a long-standing chairman of the Bulgarian Tourist Association and editor of the Bulgarian Tourist magazine. In addition, he was also Grand Master of the Grand Masonic Lodge of Bulgaria. Among his most important scientific contributions ranks his work on Bulgarian grammar, the peculiarities of Bulgarian phonology, his struggle against loanwords (linguistic purism), the enrichment of the language using dialectal words. He also published works in the field of literary history. Some of his publications (including posthumous) include: * A study on Slavonic-Bulgarian History, Plovdiv, 1898 * Sophronius of Vratsa, Sofia, 1906 * Cyril and Methodius. Passionals, Sofia, 1920 * New Bulgarian grammar, Sofia, 1940 * Struggle for modern orthography (1921-1923), Sofia, 1924 * New Bulgarian grammar for everyone, Sofia, 1958 * Selected works, Sofia, 1987 * A book about myself, Sofia, 1988 Balan's scientific legacy amounts to 886 titles, including books, studies, articles and notes, of which 310 devoted to the Bulgarian language, as well as many successful neologisms. Despite his numerous contributions, Balan lived in relative poverty, with his French wife often suffering from tuberculosis. Balan survived to almost centenarian age, he died in Sofia on 12 February 1959.

After the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War a few weeks later, French emperor Napoleon III and his army were taken prisoner in the fortress of Sedan by Prussian troops, a major step to eventual victory. In 1871, the now united Germans could not agree on a common German holiday. While the German Emperor and Empire were proclaimed on 18 January 1871, the Prussians themselves held the first coronation of a Prussian king on the same day in 1701 in higher esteem. The signing of the final peace Treaty of Frankfurt, several months later on 10 May 1871, was also not unequivocally welcomed. The southern states of Bavaria, the Grand Duchy of Baden and Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg preferred to celebrate the victories in battles to which their troops had contributed significantly, such as the Battle of W√∂rth, which had occurred already on 6 August 1870. While never proclaimed officially, and participation and official support for Sedantag celebrations varied over time, and working class leaders never really accepting it, Sedantag became a de facto national holiday, last celebrated in 1918. After the Treaty of Versailles had been signed in mid 1919, on 27 August 1919 the Ministry of the Interior of the Weimar Republic declared that no further Sedantag celebrations should take place.

Made in 1911 to print marketing materials. 120 Eleventh Avenue, Manhattan. 1994. Augustus Meyers was an American soldier during the Civil War best known for writing Ten Years in the Ranks, U.S. Army, an account of his life in the military. The book is an important historical document that contains many unique descriptions of practices that would otherwise be unknown. Augustus was the first to write about the training he received at the School of Practice on Governor's Island, New York, where Army musicians were trained.U.S. Army Bands Ten Years in the Ranks, U.S. Army was originally published by Stirling Press in 1914 and that edition was reprinted by Arno Press in 1979. Military Career Overview After joining the Army at the age of twelve in 1854, Augustus served for five years in the territories as a musician. Later after reenlisting for a second five-year term, he served in the color guard for the 2nd Infantry Regiment and became the youngest sergeant in his company at age twenty-one. He was detailed as brigade commissary sergeant. Later in the war, during the battle for Petersburg, Augustus was appointed acting ordnance sergeant.Fisher, pg. 122 At the end of the war, with the support of the commander Col William F. Drum, Augustus was commissioned as a 2nd Lt. in the 5th New York Volunteer Infantry, also known as Duryee's Zouaves after Colonel Abram Dury√©e, the original commander of the regiment. Although so commissioned, Augustus was not officially mustered in, choosing to return to civilian life instead. Nevertheless, he was permitted to participate with the group's veterans' association. In 1888, he served as a Vice Chairman of the dedication committee for the unveiling of the bronze statue of Gouverneur K. Warren at Little Round Top, Gettysburg. General Hiram Duryea served as the chairman. At the Battle of Gettysburg, Warren was acting as Chief Engineer for the Army of the Potomac and was directed to Little Round Top by Meade. His initiative during the battle in saving that key position earned him the name \\"the hero of Little Round Top.\\" The statue by Karl Gerhardt rests on the exact spot where Warren stood when looking over the field on that day. At an earlier time, Warren had commanded the 5th New York. He took over command after Dury√©e was promoted to the rank of general. The Fifth New York veterans' association funded the creation of the statue. Biographical Information Augustus Meyers was born on June 21, 1841 in the community of Morschwyl, a part of the Borough of Rorschach, in the Swiss canton of St. Gallen. He was baptised Johann Baptist August Maier. Eventually he adopted the more American spelling of his name. Along with his mother, Franziska (Benz) Maier, later known as Frances, and a half-brother Joseph Peter Maier, he immigrated to the United States in 1852. His father, Joseph Alois Maier, had preceded the family in 1848 but is presumed to have died soon afterwards. They settled in New York City. Augustus lost contact with his half-brother Joseph and after the Civil War spent many years trying to locate him without success. Details of Military Career On March 28, 1854, two years after immigrating, Augustus joined the army for a five-year term. His true age was 12 years and 9 months but he claimed to be 14 in order to qualify. On the roster his name is given as August Maier, occupation pocket- book maker. Augustus had been working in a factory, an indication of the family's poverty. The roster further shows that he was only 4'10\\" in height with a pale complexion and grey eyes. He served out the 5-year term as a musician playing the fife and for much of the time he was stationed with Company D of the 2nd US Infantry in the Minnesota and Nebraska Territories, well beyond the reach of civilization. Attempted Desertion The record shows that during his service, on September 27, 1857 he deserted from Fort Randall, South Dakota. He was arrested 3 days later in Sioux City, Iowa having made his way 120 miles down the Missouri River. He was court martialed and sentenced to 6 months of hard labor with a ball and chain and fined $10 plus an additional fine to cover the cost of his recapture. During the trial he declined to testify in his own defense. Fortunately for Augustus, his commanding officer, Captain William M. Gardner, testified on his behalf and prevailed on the court to suspend the harsher penalties. Augustus was only required to make up the 3 days of lost service and pay $30 to cover the cost of his apprehension. The episode is not disclosed in his book. Augustus did however express his gratitude toward the Captain. Captain William Montgomery Gardner Captain William M. Gardner was a graduate of the US Military Academy and had served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War with distinction. So his support for Augustus carried some weight. Gardner testified that during the three years prior to the desertion, as his commanding officer, he had never found any fault with Augustus. Gardner went on to praise Augustus as about the best boy he had ever seen in the Army. Gardner was from Georgia and when his state seceded he resigned from the U.S. Army and became a lieutenant Colonel in the 8th Georgia Infantry Regiment. In his first engagement at Bull Run Gardner took a miniball in the ankle. Delayed treatment prolonged his suffering but an amputation eventually helped him regain some vitality. He finished his service in administrative positions and went on to live until 1901. Desertions were common from Fort Randall at that time. The region was mostly uninhabited and the few civilized areas operated without much formal authority. Few deserters were recaptured and soldiers took advantage of the opportunity to escape the hardships of service to try their luck in the growing West. For the year 1857, Captain Gardner reported 24 desertions from his Company \\"D\\". Of that number, Augustus was the 20th to desert, but he was the only deserter during that year who was recaptured (one other surrendered voluntarily). At the end of his term in 1859 Augustus was discharged at Fort Randall and left to make his own way home back home. When he reenlisted and returned to the territories, Augustus happened to cross paths with Gardner once more. Gardner was on his way to Georgia for a six months furlough but promised Augustus to help him get an appointment to West Point when he returned. However, Gardner never returned and Augustus never met him again. War was declared and Gardner joined the Confederacy before his furlough was up. As he relates in his book, Augustus lived in close contact with the Dakota Sioux for almost five years while stationed in the Nebraska and Minnesota Territories. He was a keen observer of their customs and he made a deliberate effort to learn their language. His observations were well documented in the book. After returning to New York City in 1859 Augustus worked diligently to find a career that offered encouraging prospects but he was not successful. He lacked the connections and the experiences in civilian life that were necessary at that time to compete for the few opportunities available. So in March 1860, he reenlisted for another 5 years and was returned to the territories to join his old regiment. At the time neither he nor anyone else anticipated the storm that would overtake the country when Lincoln was elected the following November. When news of the war first reached the soldiers out West they were anxious to join the fight, and they expected with regret that it would be settled before they had a chance to see action. In July 1861 Augustus and his regiment were ordered to Washington and their worries about missing the action were soon extinguished. During the next 4 years they served with the Army of the Potomac and they were engaged in many of the great battles including Manassas, Antietam, Chancellorsville, Fredericksburg and Gettysburg. Civilian Life Augustus grew up speaking German until he was eleven. After coming to the US he was forced to work before joining the Army, so he never had the advantages of a formal education. Nevertheless, he was able to become sufficiently well educated to write effectively and clearly in English. That is a testament to his self-discipline and his determination to succeed in life. During his service he used his time productively to study. His studies were facilitated by the assistance and encouragement of a few kind mentors, especially Lieutenant James Curtis, a West Point Graduate. After the war, he enrolled in the free night school offered at Cooper Union and earned a degree in architecture. Eventually he married Elizabeth Cozzens from Albany and made his fortune in the building trade. Elizabeth was the daughter of Scots Irish immigrants. Later in his career, he developed several large warehouse buildings along the Hudson River which still stand today. His first large project, measuring 100,000 square feet, was 547-553 W. 27th / 548-552 W. 28th. It is located just east of 11th Avenue spanning the block between 27th and 28th street. Prior to construction it was pre-leased to the firm of Berlin & Jones. It is now included in the Chelsea historic district, and it has been adapted from its original industrial use to serve as the workspace for multiple eclectic creative commercial tenants including over 2 dozen art galleries. The largest of these is the non-profit Aperture Foundation. The building is now known as the \\"Landmark Arts Building\\" having been granted NYC Landmark status. Another building Augustus developed in 1911 still stands at 545-547 West 20th Street/120 Eleventh Avenue. The Spike Bar occupied the corner on the ground floor from the 1970s until 2000. Beginning in the 1980s several commercial photographers moved in taking advantage of the large open lofts. For some time after that it was leased to several art galleries. Now it has been converted to high end residential lofts that were marketed as the \\"Lifesaver Lofts\\". It is claimed that Mint Products Company manufactured Life Saver mints there from 1913 to 1916. Augustus traveled widely and circled the world several times. He had six children and died in NYC in 1919.

Field Musicians) at Fort Columbus, Governors Island, in New York Harbor was the United States Army's institute for musical training before and during the American Civil War. Much of the historical documentation of the School comes from Ten Years in the Ranks, U.S. Army, a book written by Augustus Meyers after enlisting at age twelve in the 1850s. The first part deals with the School of Practice. The official training guide, adopted by the War Department, was George G. Bruce's The Drummers and Fife Guide, which was used until the end of the Civil War.U.S. Army Bands The school appears to be one of two that were established at Fort Columbus and Newport Barracks, Kentucky in the later 1830s. Both posts were the eastern and western recruiting centers for the U.S. Army infantry. Little more is known about the school at Newport Barracks. The school was housed in a former fortification and battery called South Battery which was constructed prior to the War of 1812. From about 1836 to about 1878, musicians at the school, typically teenaged boys, orphaned or with few occupational prospects, lived in small rooms with double bunk beds, consisting of large bags filled with straw. Meals consisted of stapes like rice or bean soup, bread, potatoes, boiled salt beef or pork, and coffee. Enlistees earned seven dollars a month, for training six days a week. By the late 1870s, Fort Columbus was designated as a major army headquarters, bringing numerous generals to the post. To serve their needs South Battery was converted into an officers mess.

His feast day is 31 May.  Life  The Saint and Martyr Hermias was a soldier who had spent long years in the Roman army, in Comana in Pontus.As opposed to Comana in Cappadocia Completing his service under the reign of Antoninus Pius (138-161), he refused any pay and confessed his faith to Christ. He was arrested and brought before Sebastian, Proconsul in Comana, who summoned him to renounce his confession to show his loyalty towards the Roman emperor. As Hermias refused vigorously, he was sent to be tortured. His tormentors broke his jaws, and then tore off the skin of his face. He was then thrown in a burning furnace, from which he left unscathed after three days. Sebastian then decided to resort to a sorcerer Marus, who concocted a strong poison with the intention of killing the Saint. Hermias blessed the poison with the sign of the cross and drank it with no harm. Having seen Saint Hermias drink with no effect a second stronger poison that he had prepared for him, Marus himself confessed the divine power of Christ and was immediately beheaded. Saint Marus was baptized in his own blood, and was made a martyr. Hermias was then subjected to new torments: he was plunged in boiling oil, his eyes were gouged out, and he was then suspended upside down for three days, but he kept giving thanks to Christ. Finally, the crazed Sebastian beheaded him with his own sword. Christians secretly buried the body of the martyr Hermias, whose relics bestowed numerous healings.

Synopsis Look Homeward, Angel traces the coming of age of Eugene Gant, as well as the lives of his family members. It takes place in the town of Altamont, North Carolina. Eugene's mother, Eliza, runs a boarding house, \\"Dixieland\\", where boarders often interact with and affect the lives of the Gants. His father, William Oliver, runs a marble sculpture shop, where is his prized possession, a statue of an angel. The play begins by showing life in the boarding house when a young woman, Laura enters and requests to stay there. Gant enters drunk, but is eventually helped by his daughter, Helen. The next scene sees Eugene and his brother, Ben, discussing life and love. Eugene meets Laura, and they appear to fall in love, though Eugene lies about his age, claiming to be older. Eliza and Gant fight over the matter of selling his shop and the angel statue. Eliza enters the boarding house and begins arguing with Ben, cumulating in her slapping him. The next scene, days later, sees Gant and Eugene working in his shop. Laura enters to confront Eugene about the truth‚Äîshe has lied about her age and he has as well. Eliza enters, ready to sell Gant's shop, until he at last announces that rather than use the money for Dixieland's expenses, he would take the money, put Gene in college, and begin traveling. Eliza rips up his check in a fit of fury and exits. Immediately following, Ben falls ill. He is then seen on his deathbed, where he dies. The third act opens with Eugene and Laura in their bedroom.

De Klijte split from Reningelst in 1976 and is now part of the Heuvelland municipality. Sports Reningelst is host to several major cycling races each year. Reningelst calls itself a wielerdorp.

Probably the most popular tourist site is the Catholic village church, the St. Vedastuskerk. In the year 1568 three priests of Reningelst were murdered here because of the religious persecution during that period. The church was burned down in 1623 by Ypres Geuzen and was rebuilt to it current, Gothic architecture circa 1623. However, it was again destroyed during the First World War (1914‚Äì1918) and again repaired. Although it was the town center during these perilous times, was never occupied by the German army. Today, still, much of the wooden interior of the church is of important historical value. The village used to have a castle that was built around 1100. On September 6, 1793 the fortified castle was completely burnt down, on the orders of General Van Damme. A double railway was constructed where the castle stood (now a meadow) during the First World War. Reningelst was a stopover for many soldiers on their way to or from the front. After the war, several military cemeteries were built across the Westhoek, as well as in Reningelst. There is the Grootebeek British Cemetery, the Reninghelst Churchyard Cemetery next to the civil cemetery around the church. The Reninghelst New Military Cemetery includes those from the Chinese Labour Corps. There is also a Memorial for the military and civilian victims of World War I and World War II from Reningelst. In the former village hall, the history of Reningelst appears on a stained-glass window. Until the 1960s a brewery on the village square brewed Ro√∂kop (translated from Flemish: Red Head). The beer has now gone, but the brewery still stands (though part of it in ruins), now as the local cultural centre, also called Rookop. The Rookop cultural centre houses many local sports and hobby clubs. Local theatre groups sometimes play there. Since 2006 it is also the location for the annual \\"Troost van Schoonheid\\" (Comfort of Beauty) one-day music and poetry festival. There are two bed-and-breakfasts in the village centre. Public services The village currently has a primary school, spread over two locations: one in the Pastoorstraat, and one in the Baljuwstraat. Reningelst also has a forward Firefighter station.

Built in 1946, it is notable for its involvement in the 1952 SS Pendleton rescue, one of the most daring such events recorded in the history of the United States Coast Guard. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005, and now serves as a museum boat. Description CG-36500 is a standard 36-foot lifeboat, a vessel specifically designed to remain operational under extremely difficult conditions. It has a heavy bronze keel and skeg, watertight compartments, and self-bailing features. Most of its wooden elements are white oak frames, with cypress planking and it has a total weight of nearly . It is sheathed with Monel plating, which allows for winter time ice breaking. History The boat was built in 1946 at the Curtis Bay Maryland Coast Guard Yard, where all 36-footers were built. On 18 February 1952, the crew of CG-36500, which consisted of Boatswain's Mate First Class Bernard C.

(The ship's eight other crew members, including Captain John Fitzgerald, were on the bow section when it broke off and sank.) The rescue of the survivors of the shipwrecked Pendleton is considered one of the most daring rescues of the United States Coast Guard. The story is told in the 2016 motion picture The Finest Hours, based on the 2009 book by the same title. The boat was taken out of service in 1968, and was given to the National Park Service for use as an exhibit at Cape Cod National Seashore. In November 1981, the Park Service, which had not effected any significant restoration work on the vessel, deeded it to the Orleans Historical Society, and a restoration started by a group of volunteers from Chatham, Orleans, and Harwich, Massachusetts.Tougias, p. 177 Restoration work was completed in six months and the boat was re-launched in a public ceremony that was attended by Bernard Webber and his wife.Tougias, p. 179 See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Barnstable County, Massachusetts Notes Citations References used * Category:Ships of the United States Coast Guard Category:Ships on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts Category:Buildings and structures in Barnstable County, Massachusetts Category:Orleans, Massachusetts Category:National Register of Historic Places in Barnstable County, Massachusetts Category:Museum ships in Massachusetts Category:1946 ships Category:Ships built in Maryland Category:Maritime incidents in 1952 Category:Motor lifeboats of the United States ","title":"Coast Guard Motor Lifeboat CG 36500"},{"id":"18702211","text":"Area around AbonotechosAbonoteichos ( Av√≥nou t√≠chos, demonym: Avonotich√≠tis), later Ionopolis (ŒôœâŒΩœåœÄŒøŒªŒπœÇ Ion√≥polis; ), was an ancient city in Asia Minor, on the site of modern ƒ∞nebolu (in Asian Turkey) and remains a Latin Catholic titular see.

Charles Codman Estate is a historic house on Bluff Point Drive in Barnstable, Massachusetts. Built in 1870, the house is a well-preserved example of a summer seaside resort house in Queen Anne/Shingle style. It was designed by Boston architect John Sturgis, and modified in the early 20th century, adding some Colonial Revival elements. The estate was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in March 1987, and it was included in the Cotuit Historic District in November 1987. Description and history The Codman House is set near the end of Bluff Point Drive, a semi-private spur road off Ocean View Drive just south of its junction with Main Street in Cotuit. It is set on the south side of the road, shortly before the circle at the end of the road. It is a large L-shaped 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with hipped and gabled roof, and shingle siding. The short leg of the L projects forward from the right side of the north-facing main facade, and the entrance is near the crook of the L on the long side, which is five bays wide. The two left first-floor bays project, covered by a metal hip roof. Gable-roof dormers pierce the roof on several elevations, some of which have been joined to enlarge the interior space. A single-story porch wraps around the eastern and southern sides, with a bowed projection. The house was built in 1870 by Colonel Charles Codman, an American Civil War veteran who had been summering in the area for twenty years prior to purchasing the property. Designed by Boston architect John Sturgis, the house originally had Queen Anne styling that included bands of decoratively cut shingles and jerkin-headed dormers with bargeboard trim. A later owner removed these features and added others, including the dormer extensions, giving the house a more Colonial Revival feeling.

It extends along Main Street from Lowell Street in the north to Sea Street in the south, and includes portions of Ocean View Avenue and properties on adjacent roads. The oldest properties date to the late 18th century (including the c. 1790 Samuel Dottridge House, now a local historical society museum), but saw its greatest development during the height of the area's maritime industry in the mid 19th century. In the late 19th and early 20th century the area saw new development as a summer resort area. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. History Cotuit is located in southwestern Barnstable, on a peninsula bounded on the west by the Santuit River and on the east by Cotuit Bay. The central village of Cotuit is on the northeastern part of this peninsula, extending north and south along Main Street from its junction with School Street. The district includes about 125 mainly residential properties, with most construction dates falling between about 1850 and 1920. The area was first settled in the late 18th century as an agricultural area, and did not achieve prominence as a maritime center until the 19th century. Large-scale sea-faring activities generally raised maritime activities on the south coast of Cape Cod, and Cotuit became home to a number of sea captains and maritime businesses by the mid-19th century. This resulted in the construction of a significant number of fine Greek Revival and Italianate houses that line Main Street. In the late 19th century the area saw a rise in the construction of summer homes, albeit on a restrained scale. These homes filled in areas around the older homes, and are predominantly Queen Anne in style, although the district includes several Colonial Revival houses. The Cotuit Library, built about 1910 on Main Street, is the district's only significant Classical Revival building.

It is located at 564 Main Street, in a National Register-listed Romanesque Revival building donated by Chatham native Marcellus Eldredge. It was designed by Boston architect A. M. Marble. Architecture and history The library is set at the southeast corner of Main Street and Library Lane in Chatham's central business district. It is a 1-1/2 story brick and stone structure, with a slate roof and a granite foundation. Its Romanesque Revival features include parapeted end walls, eyebrow dormers, and brownstone trim, including beltcourses, window trim, and corner quoining. A 1968 addition, extending the building to the rear, was rebuilt in the early 1990s to more sympathetically resemble the original building. The interior has floors of marble and oak, and lavish oak woodwork. The Chatham library has its origins in a small library in South Chatham in 1875, and a library and reading room in Chatham village in 1887. Marcellus Eldredge, a Chatham native who made a fortune as a brewer in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, offered the town a new library building, which was constructed in 1896 at a cost of $30,000. The designer was the otherwise little-known Boston architect A. M. Marble. Eldredge also established a $20,000 endowment to maintain the library. This building was enlarged in 1968 to a design by Alger and Gunn of Hyannis, and again in 1991-92 by A. Anthony Tappe of Tapp√© Architects in Boston.

It is centered on the junction of Lake Elizabeth Drive and Ocean Avenue, just west of Lake Elizabeth. The camp meeting was established in 1871 by the New England Convention of Christian Churches on land that was purchased from members of the Perry family. Along the grid of roads south of the main junction, gingerbread-decorated Gothic cottages were built over the following decades. The main tabernacle, an open-walled church, was built in 1887. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history Craigville is located in southern Barnstable, between the villages of Centerville and Hyannisport. The historic district encompasses the original core of a religious camp meeting area established in 1871 on what was before then called \\"Strawberry Hill\\" and became known thereafter as \\"Christian Hill\\". Originally called \\"Camp Christian\\", the area quickly developed, with a store and post office (both built 1872-73), and an inn (1874). It was renamed Craigville in 1881 after the death of Dr. J. Austin Craig. The camp's central feature, its tabernacle, was originally a large tent with a capacity of 600 worshippers, which assumed its more permanent framing and elements in 1887. The area around the tabernacle was subdivided into small parcels, on which campers erected temporary, and eventually permanent structures. This pattern of development was similar to camp meetings established earlier, including ones at Yarmouth and Martha's Vineyard. Architecturally, the Craigville camp meeting's buildings are predominantly Carpenter Gothic in style, a favorite in numerous other camp meeting grounds. By the end of the 1870s more than thirty cottages had been built and sold, and the number grew into the 1930s. Alpha Cottage is a typical early structure, 1-1/2 stories in height, with a flushboarded facade with carved vergeboard and balcony trim. The post office and store, both built in 1872-73, are relatively plain vernacular commercial buildings, as is the 1874 Craigville Inn. The historic district is bounded on the north by the tabernacle property, which is just north of the junction of Lake Elizabeth Drive and Ocean Avenue. The other public buildings are located on the east side of Lake Elizabeth Drive, just south of that junction, and the cottages included in the district line Laurel, Valley, and Ocean Avenues as far as Hotel Avenue.

The complex consists of an 1898 Queen Anne pumping station designed by Ernest N. Boyden, a low-lift pump and water treatment building built in 1993, a chlorination tank also built in 1993, and a house and garage added in 1932. The plant was built in response to rising demand for vacation properties and fire suppression, and continues to fulfill those functions today. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Description and history The Falmouth Pumping Station is set on and adjacent to a narrow isthmus of land which separates Grews Pond from Long Pond in central-western Falmouth. Its parcel lies within Good Will Park, most of which lies to its south, and is otherwise surrounded by town-owned land. Vehicular access is via Pumping Station Road, which is normally limited to town personnel. A walking trail around Long Pond passes next to the pumping station (at the location labeled \\"Water Dept\\" on the linked map). The pumphouse is a three-section masonry structure measuring about . Its central portion, originally housing a steam engine, boiler room, and pump, was designed by Ernest Boyden, a Massachusetts architect noted for his waterworks designs, and dates to 1898. The eastern section is an engineer's dwelling that was added in 1903 (also to Boyden's specifications), and the western section is a newer pump building added in 1953. Boyden's section is the most architecturally elaborate, with a hip roof topped by a bellcast cupola, windows set in segmented-arch openings, and a larger round- arched main entrance with double doors. The engineer's dwelling is characterized by a porch with large fieldstone piers. The low-lift pumping and water treatment building, and the chlorination tank are both set across the road from the pumphouse. The former is a simple brick building with a shallow- pitch gable roof. The tank, which as a capacity of , is built out of reinforced concrete and has shallow domed top. The house and garage are located down the road to the west of these structures. The house is a 1-1/2 story structure built out of rusticated concrete blocks, with a side-gable roof that has three gabled dormers. Directly adjoining is a five-bay wood frame garage, also with a side-gable roof. Prior to the construction of this complex, Falmouth residents took their water from either open water sources or hand-pumped wells. The town by 1896 provided seven hand-pumped wells for this purpose. Although the community at first resisted establishing a municipal water supply, growing demand from vacationers who owned property in the town, combined with increasing fire insurance rates for areas not covered by a municipal water system, prompted its construction. The Falmouth Water Supply Company, a private venture controlled by summer residents, was established in 1898. The complex was built on land owned by one of the proprietors, Joseph Story Fay, who had also given Good Will Park to the town. The town in 1900 voted to exercise an option to purchase the company from its owners, a process completed two years later. The town eventually also purchased a number of other private water providers.

It is centered on the triangular village green formed by Main Street, West Main Street, and Hewins Street, and extends south on Locust Street to the Old Town Cemetery. This area has been the town center since 1756, and is architecturally dominated by late Colonial and Federal period buildings. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history The town of Falmouth was settled in about 1660, but was not set off from Barnstable until 1686. Its first town center was about south of the present green, and the 1756 relocation of the meeting house to this area was the subject of much debate. This move spurred the construction of houses along what is now Locust Street, which connected the new center to the south coast, and adjacent to the meeting house, where seven houses survive from that period. Of particular note are the Museums on the Green,Falmouth Historical Society, Museums on the Green owned and operated by the Falmouth Historical Society, with two historic houses and an exhibit center presenting the history of Falmouth, in a setting of gardens by the Falmouth Garden Club. The First Congregational Church, built in 1796, was originally located on the green, but was moved to its north side in 1858. Its belfry houses a bell manufactured by Paul Revere. The green continues to be a major gathering place for civic functions. Initially an agricultural community, maritime economic activity became more important in Falmouth the late 18th and early 19th century. Between the 1850s and 1870s a number of Italianate houses were built, typically by ship's captains or other associated with maritime trades. Later buildings are more reflective of the area's transformation around the turn of the 20th century into a summer resort area, including the Queen's Buyway, a 1925 series of Colonial Revival shops on Palmer Avenue.

It has Greek Revival features, including gable end returns, and transom windows over the two entrances. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description and history The Forestdale School is set on the west side of Massachusetts Route 130, close to the road, just north of the Forestdale Fire Station. It is a small single- story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof, wooden shingle siding, and a brick foundation covered in concrete. A small ell of early 20th- century date extends the building to the rear. The main facade, facing the street, has two symmetrically-placed entrances, each surmounted by a transom window and a projecting cornice. A single sash window is placed centrally in the gable. The side elevations each have two sash windows. The main block has two small vestibule areas, which open into the large classroom area; the rear ell is taken up by a kitchen and bathrooms. The main room has retained its original wainscoting. The school was built in 1878 to serve the predominantly agricultural Forestdale area of Sandwich, which was known as Greenville prior to 1887. Of 21 district schools built by the town in the 19th century, it is the least-altered one to survive. The school was operated until 1927, when the district schools were consolidated into a single graded school. It was then leased by the town to the Forestdale Men's Club, which met in the building until the 1960s. After undergoing restoration, it was briefly used as a branch library, preschool, and dancing school. Since 1980 it has been used by local Boy Scouts as a meeting space.

Built in 1891, the hut formed a linkage point in the transatlantic telegraph cable of the French Cable Company connecting the cable, where it came ashore near the present site to its main station in Orleans. After the cable was abandoned in 1932, the hut was adapted for residential use. It has since been restored to its turn-of- the-century appearance by the National Park Service. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The cable hut is a small single-story wood frame structure with a gable roof, and measures about . Its walls are finished in wooden shingles, and it has simple white trim. There is a door in one gable end, and a single sash window in one of the side walls. The building was restored to its early 20th-century appearance in 1998-2000, after being relocated about from the eroding shoreline. It is set in a historically compatible way near the Nauset Beach Light, which was also moved in the 1990s. The first French-owned transatlantic cable was laid in 1869 from Brest, France to Duxbury, Massachusetts, and was acquired by an American company in 1873. A new French Cable Company was established, which in 1879 laid a second cable to Eastham via Saint Pierre and Miquelon, with a small station near the shore in Eastham. For the benefit of its workers, the company established a new station in Orleans (which now houses a museum), and replaced the original station with this hut, where the transatlantic cable was joined to one running along Nauset Beach and through Town Cove to Orleans. The cable was operated until World War II, when it was abandoned with the French surrender to Nazi Germany in 1940. The cabin was abandoned, and auctioned by the town for back taxes in 1946, without prior notification to the company. The new owners added living quarters, increasing the building's size to about . The original hut footprint, which had originally been unfinished inside, was finished for use as a living room, and bedrooms and a kitchen were built on. This building was used as a seasonal rental property until 1972, when it was acquired by the National Park Service as part of the Cape Cod National Seashore. The park service used it for seasonal employee housing. When surveyed in 1986, the hut was about from the edge of the bluff above Nauset Beach. In 1998 the building was relocated back from the bluff and restored to its original appearance, removing the living quarters and alterations made in the mid-20th century.

Description and history The Fuller House is set on the northwest side of Parker Road in West Barnstable, just northeast of its junction with Church Street, and is set near the road, behind a low fieldstone wall. Its main block is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, three bays wide, with a side gable roof and wood shingle siding. In a somewhat unusual arrangement for the period, the chimney is located centered behind the northernmost bay, while the main entrance, which is more typically in front of the chimney, is located in the southern bay. The entry is flanked by pilasters and topped by a transom window, typical Federal style features. The windows are six-over-six sash, with simple trim surrounds. There are two small extension ells, one to either side of the main block. The property includes an English barn of approximately the same age just northeast of the house. Construction of the house is estimated to be about 1800 based on architectural analysis; the house is known to have been standing in 1836. The property was owned at this time by members of the Fuller family, who were engaged in a variety of agricultural pursuits. Parker Road was laid out in 1793 and widened in 1802.

It was shortlisted for the 2007 Man Booker Prize and is the Winner of the 2008 Commonwealth Writers' Prize: Best Book From Europe & South Asia. Sinha's narrator is a 19-year-old orphan of Khaufpur, born a few days before the 1984 Bhopal disaster, whose spine has become so twisted that he must walk on all fours. Ever since he can remember, he has gone on all fours. Known to every-one simply as Animal, he rejects sympathy, spouts profanity and obsesses about sex. He lives with a crazy old French nun called Ma Franci, and his dog Jara. Also, he falls in love with a local musician's daughter, Nisha. The story was recorded in Hindi on a series of tapes by Animal himself and it has been translated to English as well. The author uses Animal's odd mixture of Hindi, French and Indianised English such as \\"kampani\\" (company), \\"jarnalis\\" (journalist) and \\"jamisponding\\" (spying, like James Bond).  Title  The title Animal‚Äôs People offers interesting insight into the novel, as it gives us a view of the way the people of Khaufpur identified themselves. The chorus of the children copying Elli, after stating she doesn‚Äôt understand Animal's People, shows this unification of the people of Khaufpur. \\"We can hear the chorus of small voices gradually falling behind, ‚ÄòHey Animal‚Äôs People!‚Äô\\"Sinha, Indra. Animal's People. Great Britain: Simon & Schuster (2007) Unification of people usually takes place during a disaster, which occurs during and after the crisis in Khaufpur. The title of the novel is used to help identify this unification of people and also to foreshadow the difficulty Elli will face when trying to open the clinic. Elli will have to try to break down the tough barriers which exist in Khaufpur, to help the people move past what they fear the most, change. The comfort they seek is always being able to blame the kampani for what happened to them, and assuming every outsider is there because the kampani sent them. The relation to the title is that Animal is a prime example of the hatred, with his foul mouth and negative attitude towards everything. The title \\"Animal‚Äôs People\\" also refers to the difference in behaviors and attitudes between the citizens of Kaufpur and the American doctor, Elli. This becomes apparent on page 183 when Elli is frustrated about everyone's attitude toward her clinic, and yells \\"HEY ANIMAL‚ÄôS PEOPLE! I DON‚ÄôT [...] UNDERSTAND YOU!\\" She came to Kaufpur with only a mere idea of how the people had suffered. She knew that people were ill and her duty would be to nourish them back to health, but that was the extent of her connection to them. Due to her more fortunate circumstances, she could never fully grasp the trauma and the aftermath of the gas leak or the chronic poverty which plagued the city. Furthermore, she was oblivious to the reasons why the citizens were so untrustworthy toward outsiders. Without experiencing it for herself, Elli the doctress was an outcast among the rest of the city of Kaufpur‚ÄîAnimal's People.  Major characters  ;Animal Animal is the protagonist of this story. He is a victim of a chemical factory explosion caused by Kampani and is depicted as a boy with a twisted spine that roams around Khaufpur on both of his hands and feet like a dog. He constantly denies his humanity and claims that he is an animal. After this factory incident, Animal is put in an orphanage and taken care of by Ma Franci. He has no recollection of his parents. Animal openly displays his hatred toward humans yet there is a side of him that yearns to be a human being. Therefore, when an American doctor comes to Khaufpur, he regains his lost hope of being able to stand on his own two feet and dreams for that day to come. Although Animal initially loathes his inability to walk on two feet, in the end, he realizes that being a four-foot is better off for him. By being a four-foot, Animal avoids being one of the millions of upright humans and instead becomes the one and only Animal. ;Somraj Pandit Somraj Tryambak Punekar is Nisha's father and a music teacher. He is described as tall, with a long and pointy nose, and long fingers. He also has a stoic nature, being called solemn and private by Animal. The most important fact about Somraj is that he used to be a famous singer, known throughout India, who was referred to as the Voice of Khaufpur. However the night of the accident he lost his wife and baby son, in addition to his lungs being damaged by the chemicals. He no longer sings, and if he tries he has coughing fits. ;Ma Fran√ßi Ma Fran√ßi is a nun from France who worked in the orphanage where Animal grew up. She acts as Animal's mother figure and can be described as kind, although mildly senile. Her affliction from the accident is her loss of understanding Hindi and English. She believes that everyone else is speaking gibberish and is unable to understand that they are using another language, not just making random sounds. She also sees prophetic angels as a result of her madness. However, she still does her duties of going from house to house, helping the sick and injured as best she can. ;Zafar Zafar is Nisha's boyfriend. He is described as a man in his late thirties, tall, good-looking, thin with a jutting beard, curly black hair and glasses which makes him appear wise. Zafar is an outsider who is so appalled by the Kampani actions that he moves to Khaufpur to advocate on their behalf. He sacrifices everything in his life, including his studies as a scholar for the poor and sick. He is a saint and hero to the citizens of Khaufpur. ;Farouq Farouq is Animal's friend and nemesis. Farouq's family came to Khaufpur from Yar-yilaqis. His intelligence is that of a criminal in a gang, like his two brothers, or a mechanic. He is Muslim, a movie expert, and Zafar's number two man. ;Nisha Daughter of Somraj, girlfriend of Zafar, friend of Animal. Nisha sees Animal in the gutter and introduces him to Zafar. She is the object of his affection, yet sees him as a friend only. ;Elli American doctor who comes to Khaupfur. She is frequently described as wearing blue jeans and is an object of lust for Animal and others in the town. Acting out of philanthropy, she struggles to find acceptance. Major themes=Westernization Westernization plays a key role throughout the novel: setting up key relations between characters, showing Sinha's view on western influence, and giving a more accurate depiction of \\"distant sufferers.\\" This book is about a chemical disaster‚Äîcaused by an American company‚Äîon Indian soil. Furthering this point Sinha shows a complete refusal by the same company to accept any repercussions for their actions. The various examples of apprehension towards outsiders (the journalist (Jarnaliss), the leaders of the Company (Kampani), and Elli the doctress) give insight into preexisting blame-based relationships. These outsiders, associated with the company that neglected responsibility for making the people ill, are seen as tools to help mask and minimize the harm to Khaufpur. Western materialism is objectified through Animal's eyes, with images like the Coca-Cola sign that is so commercialized that it transcends language barriers. Sinha alters facts from the real Bhopal disaster including the name of the city, the company responsible, and names of individuals involved in the relief effort. This shows how he wished to make this story applicable to all western caused debacles. Identity At the conclusion of Animal‚Äôs People, Animal finally accepts who he is‚ÄîAnimal. We see this concept of self-acceptance as a major theme in this novel, as we see Animal transform through the sharing of his story. Throughout the novel, Animal struggles internally with who he is, especially with his appearance as an animal rather than a human. However, after coming to terms with what has happened and the suffering he experienced as a consequence, Animal accepts who that has allowed him to become‚Äîa person whose identity doesn‚Äôt come from the events of the Kampani disaster, but rather a person whose identity comes from personal experiences and the people who surround him in his life. We know Animal has truly come to accept his new identity when he decisively says, \\"Stay four- foot, I‚Äôm the one and only Animal.\\" Love Love is seen in different forms throughout the novel. Perhaps the simplest form of love presented is the mother-son relationship between Animal and Ma Fran√ßi. While Animal spends much of his day away from his senile \\"mother,\\" he always makes a point to check in, especially when chaos breaks out in Khaufpur. Animal's desire for physical love is very apparent starting from the beginning of the novel. Animal speaks using vulgar language and crude humor and is often very blunt in what he wants, especially in front of the women he desires. Animal's physical love for Nisha can be recognized early in the novel, particularly when he expresses extreme jealously towards her boyfriend, Zafar. As the novel progresses, Animal's love for Nisha noticeably changes into a more compassionate type of love ‚Äì a love that allows the reader to understand that Animal has come to consider Nisha as family. Narrative structure The novel is told through Animal's tape recordings. The Kakadu Jarnalis insists Animal tell his story. The tapes are recorded in Hindi by Animal and then translated into English by the journalist. Like with previous foreign journalists, Animal thinks that his story will be entangled with everyone else's in Khaufpur; the stories of all survivors will be meshed together to form one tragic tale. To ensure this won‚Äôt happen, Animal agrees to tell his story if only it will be told exactly how it is presented through his tapes. In Animal's second tape, he dwells on the audience and directly addresses the audience. In a letter to Animal, Jarnalis states \\"Animal, you must imagine that you are talking to just one person. Slowly that person will come to seem real to you. Imagine them to be a friend. You must trust them and open your heart to them, that person will not judge you badly whatever you say.\\" Animal then talks to the reader and says \\"You are reading my words, you are that person. I‚Äôve no name for you so I will call you Eyes.\\" Indra Sinha begins Animal‚Äôs People with the editor's note: \\"This story was recorded in Hindi on a series of tapes by a nineteen-year-old boy in the Indian city of Khaufpur. True to the agreement between the boy and the journalist who befriended him, the story is told entirely in the boy‚Äôs words as recorded on the tapes.\\" Although this premise is entirely fictional, Sinha wanted to convey the story in a way that gave authority and a singular voice to the real, but little known aftermath of a gas leak in India that is considered the world's worst industrial disaster, the Bhopali disaster. The \\"recorded tapes\\" are arranged in a largely linear manner that is interrupted with flashbacks that skip between the past and present. They impart the story gradually, developing the setting and characters of Animal's past while simultaneously incorporating ongoing events. Animal tells his story in the past-tense, as he is repeating experiences to Jarnalis via the tapes. The first and second tapes introduce Animal as the narrator and establish the audience as nothing more than disembodied \\"eyes.\\" In the middle of the second tape, Animal jumps back to when he was six years old and the pains of his apparent morph from \\"human to animal\\" that occurred as his spine twisted to the point where he had to walk on all fours. He then quickly fast-forwards in tape three to the meeting of present characters: Nisha and Zafar, then interjects a narration that describes the current appearance of the Kampani's factory. The story continues in this flitting manner to uncover the full depth of the situation through Animal's unexpectedly fierce and spirited narration, giving an unconventional take on the idea of \\"distant sufferers.\\" Style Animal‚Äôs People is primarily a first-person monologue in which the narrator (Animal) details past events of his life and his internal thoughts from that time to an audience whose existence he is aware of. On occasion the novel changes to a third-person narrative where Animal narrates another character's independent experiences, such as Elli's interactions with her ex-husband in Tape Twenty. In both cases, the story, though it occurred in the past, is presented in the present tense. Despite the fact that the novel details past events, Animal is not presented as an omniscient narrator‚Äîthe reader is never informed beyond Animal himself (the character rather than the narrator) in the context of the story. This, in addition to Sinha's use of present tense to describe past events causes the reader to experience Animal's life (in the form of direct speech) alongside him while still allowing for commentary from a narrator who has already lived through these experiences (usually in the form of indirect speech). Thus, the reader is caused to identify more strongly with Animal's own thoughts, emotions, and desires as the story unfolds‚Äîsomething that falls in line with Indra Sinha's past career writing emotionally charged advertisements for charities such as Amnesty International. Influence of perspective The story told by Indra Sinha in Animal‚Äôs People is one that is obviously influenced by the Bhopal disaster from 1984, and the way Sinha wants the world to see the disaster. Sinha chose to write the story in a fictionalized setting so he could write ‚Äúfreely‚Äù, as opposed to the situation he already knew regarding Bhopal.Interview with Indra Sinha, BookDepository.co.uk, 9 December 2008. Retrieved 13 November 2013. However, his goal was to instead tell the aftermath of the disaster which he does through the lens of Animal. In Animal, the perspective of Sinha and many others still seeking reparations from the incident are channeled and reflected. Khaufpuri language Indra Sinha's inclusion of words such as kampani and Khaufpur‚Äî\\"kauf\\" meaning \\"terror\\" in Urdu ‚Äîchallenges readers' competency as linguists. Animal's language (Khaufpuri) requires readers to recognize phonetic similarities to English and etymological cues (e.g. Hindi, French) in order to ascribe meaning to the text. The inclusion of a Khaufpuri Glossary in Animal's People substantiates the cultural richness of Animal and the Khaufpuri people while successfully reminding the reader of the \\"otherness\\" of Animal. Sinha's melding of linguistic traditions enhances the meaning of the text and artistic freedom of the author. Historical references=Appearance Animal's People's description of the Kampani disaster site is accurate to Union Carbide‚Äôs actual abandoned factory. The novel depicts the factory as untouched and overgrown. So many years after the Bhopal Disaster, the Kampani company has not returned to the scene and cleaned up the mess. Animal mentions the steps leading nowhere, and the abandoned tanks ‚Äîcracked and still containing toxic chemicals. Trees and other vegetation have taken over the area, making it difficult to access and travel within. Indra Sinha's description is similar to the real factory in Bhopal, India. In 1996, tests were administered on the soil and water testing for toxic chemicals. Results came back positive‚Äîwater is still being contaminated. Through observation of pictures, tanks are left untouched, stairs leading to nothing substantial, rust covering everything, and trees and wild grass everywhere. Indra Sinha's Kampani in Animal‚Äôs People has many similarities to the Union Carbide factory in Bhopal.Watson, Paul. Cloud of Despair in Bhopal . Retrieved 10 November 2013. Correspondence Animal's People takes place in the town Khaufpur and is based on Bhopal, India. It is the site of one of the world's worst industrial accidents. The first instance of court being brought up in the novel references a trial that is said to take place 18 years after the initial disaster. Zafar tells how the Kampani refuses to recognize the court's decision to proceed with criminal charges against American executives in India. Finally at the end of this first court date, they are able to get the court to review the assets of the Kampani in an effort to bring the people responsible to justice. The court case depicted in the novel is rooted in the reality of the criminal cases surrounding the Bhopal disaster. The Indian Supreme Court was quick to bring criminal charges against the CEO of Union Carbide, Warren Anderson. Following the disaster, Anderson traveled to India and was immediately placed under house arrest upon arrival. He left the country never to return. As part of a 470 million dollar settlement reached in 1989, the criminal charges in the case were dismissed. Through petitions and protests, activists were able to restore the criminal charges against Anderson and four other Union Carbide employees in 1991. Despite this decision by Indian courts, warrants being issued, and requests for extradition, the CEO refused to appear in Indian court. Numerous trials were held that Union Carbide officials never acknowledged. In June 2012, a U.S. Court ruled that neither Union Carbide nor their former CEO were liable for any of the charges brought against them. Dow Chemical, which bought Union Carbide, has repeatedly denied responsibility for the disaster or its repercussions, but in July 2013 Indian courts decided that Dow Chemical is still responsible to survivors of the almost three decades old disaster. It is thought that 100,000 people are still suffering from the 1984 gas leak.India: Court Decision Requires Dow Chemical to Respond to Bhopal Gas Tragedy. Amnesty International. 23 July 2013. Retrieved 10 November 2013. Outside intervention The Sambhavna Trust is an organization that was founded to bring aid to the victims of the Bhopal Disaster. It set up various clinics throughout the affected area, none of which charged any fees for treatment. Each clinic was allopathic and served as a one-stop spot for treatment. In Animal‚Äôs People, this was personified through Ellie. She was able to provide medical aid to people who came to her, and also placed focus on their mental health and well-being by befriending all her patients and counseling them on a more personal level so they could finally accept and understand their disorders. The Sambhavna Trust also emphasized mental health and recovery by providing yoga and massage sessions through its Ayurveda Care department. This type of treatment is native to India and specific to the Hindu culture. Ellie made sure to medicate the whole person, not just their physical ailments. She befriended Animal and helped him through his internal struggle about the orientation of his body. At the end of the novel, Animal is very accepting of his new form and it is all from Ellie and her unconditional support. The Sambhavna Trust didn‚Äôt come about until 1996, and the gas leak occurred in 1984. In those 12 years, the victims received care in hospital-based facilities, which were too expensive for a lot of those people. Even though the Indian government eventually decided to give free healthcare to the victims, their children were not covered, even though their health was also compromised. The majority of the outsiders‚Äô focus was going towards either research or compensation and recognition for the survivors, not their health. Because of this, nobody was sure how to react to the Sambhavna Trust clinics, and whether they were actually there to help. In the book, Ellie was the first one to come in to help the victims. They were very wary of her at first, thinking that she was gathering statistics for Kampani's research, since that is what they were used beforehand. Once her intentions were regarded as pure and earned the people's trust, they were more than willing to receive her help. Reception According to The Bookbag, Sinha's book was shortlisted for the 2007 Man Booker prize, described in the Independent as an extraordinary achievement and by the Indian Express as a novel so honest it leaves you gasping for breath. Lesley Mason said in his review of Animal's People, \\"This is a book that should be part of the national curriculum through-out the world. Not only does it explore the outfall of one particular humanitarian and ecological disaster and the pitiful response to it by those responsible; but takes in the wider picture of the general attitude of richer people to the poorer and that of the so-called developed nations to those who have yet to claim a share of the power and the glory (or the muck and the money).\\" ;New York Times \\"It (Khaufpur) is also the setting for his fiercely polemical ‚Äî and unexpectedly bawdy ‚Äî novel Animal‚Äôs People, a finalist for the 2007 Man Booker Prize that reveals not a paradise but a blighted city.\\" ;Blog Critics \\"Try to imagine for a moment what it must be like to be the people of Bhopal who have lived for twenty plus years watching family and friends die, descend into madness or give birth to stillborn babies. Animal's People, the latest offering from Indian author Indra Sinha available from Simon & Schuster Canada, does just that.\\" ;Washington Post Washington Post said of Animal's People, \\"The right writer has met the right tragedy\\". ;Barnes and Noble Eric Banks of Barnes and Noble Review said, \\"It isn't hard to figure why it hooked critics: Sinha controls language so magnificently in this novel...

He was the nephew of another John King, who played one Test for England, and the son of James King, who played first-class cricket for Leicestershire. King made his debut in May 1927, for Worcestershire against Sussex at Hove, scoring 7 and 0. He remained in the side, but did not make a really sizeable contribution until his 12th innings, when he struck 91 (which was to remain his highest score) against Essex at Leyton. He ended the season with disappointing figures of 386 runs in 31 first-class innings, at an average of 13.78. In 1928, King did rather better, and indeed his 629 runs at 19.06, with three half-centuries, represented easily the best season's return of his short career. He passed a thousand runs for his career in late August, when he hit an unbeaten 50 against Warwickshire at New Road. However, in four further innings before the end of the season he never made more than 2, and for 1929 he switched counties to Leicestershire. King's one season with the county of his birth was not a success. He averaged a mere 11.84, and apart from one innings of 56 against Derbyshire in mid-July, his highest score all season was 23. By the end of July he was playing for the Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship, a position whence he never re-emerged. He did appear in two single-innings games for the county during the Second World War, but did not bat in either.

The village, originally known as Broadbrooks after a prominent local family, was developed beginning in the 18th century, and features a high quality concentration of Greek Revival and Italianate architecture. It extends along Main and Parallel Streets between the cemetery in the west and Brooks Park in the east. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history The area that is now Harwich was settled in the 17th century as part of Yarmouth, and was separately incorporated in 1694. Part of the area that is now Harwich Center was settled by members of the Broadbrooks family, who later shortened their name to Brooks. This family became one of the leading forces in the civic and economic development of the village, building at least eight of its buildings. Brooks Park, at the eastern end of the village, is where the 1732 homestead of Ebenezer Broadbrooks was located; no longer standing, its site is marked by millstones from his mill that are placed near the park entrance. Sidney Brooks founded what eventually became known as the Brooks Academy in 1844; its Greek Revival building later served as the town high school. Sidney's brother Henry donated funds for the construction of the village library. The historic district is primarily defined by Main Street, extending east-west between the cemetery to the west and Brooks Park to the east. The aptly named Parallel Street runs south of Main Street, and is joined to it by a number of smaller side streets. The village has a rural feel due to open spaces and narrow side streets. Most of the buildings in the district are of wood frame construction, and are Greek Revival or Italianate in style, reflecting their mid-19th century construction period. The village's most prominent building is the First Congregational Church, built in 1832 in the Greek Revival style, but altered in 1854 in a more Italianate Renaissance Revival style.

The -story wood-frame house was built in 1877 and has vernacular Italianate styling.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Description and history The Kelley House is on the north side of Main Street (Massachusetts Route 28) in the village of South Chatham, just east of its junction with Morton Road. It is a -story wood-frame house with a front-gable roof, wooden clapboard siding, and a brick foundation. The main facade is three bays wide, with its main entrance in the leftmost bay, and the right two bays on the first floor taken up by a bay window. Three sash windows are asymmetrically arranged on the second level, with two above the bay window and one above the entrance. A round-arch window is set in the gable. The entry is sheltered by a hip-roofed scrolled hood with paired Italianate brackets, details also found on the bay window. Paired brackets are also found in the eave lines of the front and side elevations. There is a porch on the right elevation, running back to an ell extending to the rear. The porch has turned posts and geometric panels that are Queen Anne in style, along with Italianate brackets. The Eldridge family were significant landowners and developers of South Chatham in the early 19th century. Mercelia Eldridge's father Levi operated a number of businesses on the cape, was a bank president and Chatham town selectman, and held other prominent local posts. Mercelia and her second husband, Cyrus Kelley, built the house in 1877 on family-owned land. The house was not particularly elaborately decorated for the period, was probably built using lumber from her father's lumber yard, and is one of the best-preserved of a series of houses built along Main Street after the American Civil War. The house remained in the hands of her descendants until 2002. In 2002, the house was sold to David M. Valdez, who undertook both submitting the house for inclusion the National Register and the completion of a Federally Certified Historic Restoration of the house that included the preservation of the existing layout and all of the original windows, interior painted wood doors, and trim that were part of the original decor from 1877 that made the doors and trim appear to be made from more precious hardwoods. These same painted wood finishes (probably by the same artist) are in the interior of the Captain Penniman House that was initially decorated and completed in 1868. The Penniman House is nearby in the Fort Hill area of Cape Cod National Sea Shore, which was the highest point adjacent to the meetinghouse erected by Pilgrim residents of Nauset (later Eastham) shortly after they settled the area in 1644.

It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a front-gable roof, Greek temple portico facade and a two-stage bell tower. The portico consists of an entablature and gabled pediment supported by four Ionic columns. The pediment is flushboarded, with modillioned cornice and eaves. The bell tower has a square clapboarded first stage with a modillioned cornice, and an octagonal belfry as the second stage. It is a reconstruction of the original tower based on historic photographs. Lawrence Academy was built in 1834, following a regional trend for the establishment of private academies. The school incorporated in 1835. Beginning in the 1870s, changes in state regulations required towns to provide secondary education. Pursuant to this goal, the town acquired the academy building in 1890, and used it as its high school until a new building was completed in 1896. The town leased the hall to the local chapter of the Grand Army of the Republic, a Civil War veterans organization, and it was later used by Sons of Union Veterans and the American Legion. A sympathetic addition lengthening the building was made in the 1940s, and the bell tower was rebuilt in the 1960s and repaired in the 1990s after it was damaged by Hurricane Bob. It is currently home to the local chamber of commerce.

The remains of the steps can be seen. Whale Chine is a geological feature near Chale on the south-west coast of the Isle of Wight, England (the Back of the Wight). One of a number of such chines on the island created by stream erosion of soft Cretaceous and Jurassic rocks, it is a narrow and steep coastal ravine dropping 140 feet through Lower Greensand rocks from clifftop farmland to Chale Bay. Its name probably originates from the Wavell family, owners of the nearby Atherfield Farm between 1557 and 1636.Finest Landscapes, The Isle of Wight Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Partnership Newsletter, Issue 13, citing The Place-Names of the Isle of Wight, A D Mills. It is reached from a car park on the A3055 coastal road, where a stream running parallel to the cliff takes a right-angled bend to descend to the beach.The Jurassic isle of England, Chris Fautley, The Sunday Times, 2 July 2000 In the past, descent to the beach at Whale Chine could be achieved by some 126 wooden steps, since their closure in 2005, these steps were washed away by the sea in the winter storms of 2013/14. As the beach is a popular fishing site, Local fisherman have constructed a new flight of stairs by carving steps down through the rock, although this is not recommended. Despite the old steps forming part of a footpath and legal Right of Way (footpath C34, Chale Parish), the Isle of Wight Council refused to repair them, stating that \\"major structural works at great expense would be required to make the path safe for use with no guarantee that such works would be a permanent solution.\\" They have been inaccessible to the public since at least 2005 and subject to a \\"temporary closure\\" since then. Geologically the cliffs here belong to the Wealden supergroup and were deposited in a large scale meandering river and floodplain facies about 150 million years ago. The cliffs are famous for their fossil content which are commonly found in flash flood sandy deposits. These deposits can usually be recognized by the abundance of pyrite rich fossilized wood, and usually form as trough shapes. These troughs are characteristic of infilled stream channels caused by the deposition of the high energy carried material and organisms. Due to this the deposits are poorly sorted and the fossils amongst them are usually broken up.A Stratigraphical Account of the Section from Atherfield to Rocken End on the south-west coast of the Isle of Wight, William Henry Fitton, The Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London, Vol. 3, 1847 Google Books, retrieved 3 August 2008 Whale Chine is a popular fishing spot for many anglers. It boosts very clear sandy ground with intermittent rock features. The species caught here vary, but it is locally known as one of the best spots on the island for ray fishing: This is best from March‚ÄìOctober. All summer species can be caught here, and it's not uncommon for shoals of mackerel and bass to drive whitebait onto the shore. Throughout the winter the fishing declines abit, with pout being the most common fish caught.

It and its companion transmitter station at Marion were used for WCC, the busiest ship to shore radio station for most of the 20th century, replacing the original WCC site in South Wellfleet. The district includes eight red brick buildings constructed by Marconi in 1914 to house the station's operations; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994, and is now home to the Chatham Marconi Maritime Center museum. Station history In 1914, inventor Guglielmo Marconi sought a more permanent solution to his weather-induced radio station woes on Cape Cod. This need was made manifest by the damage and destruction wrought by nature at his original 1903 South Wellfleet location. The erosion and wind damage suffered by Marconi's first Cape Cod station continues to this day. Almost the entirety of the historic station is now long gone over the cliffs onto the beach and into the waters of the Atlantic below. It was with great foresight that Marconi realized that a permanent (by 1914 commercial) presence would require a more inland and somewhat sheltered location. So it was that his Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America built his new receiver station in Chatham and its companion transmitter site forty miles to the west in Marion, Massachusetts through a contract with J.G. White Engineering Corp. In 1920, the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America sold the Chatham and Marion stations to the Radio Corporation of America. RCA removed all remaining Marconi equipment at the Chatham receiver station and converted it to a marine radio station for communications with ships at sea. In 1921 it was licensed under the callsign WCC for communications on 500 kHz, 750 kHz and 1 MHz. In 1922 RCA moved the transmitters to the Marion transmitter station to eliminate co-site interference to the sensitive receivers at Chatham. The WCC marine radio transmitter equipment was moved to RCA's newly built ocean front transmitter site on Forest Beach Road in South Chatham, Massachusetts in 1948. The U.S. Air Force subsequently used the Marion facility for VLF broadcasts to its facilities in Greenland and the Arctic. RCA sold the Marion site to the U.S. Government in 1951 and the U.S. General Services Administration sold it to a private investor in 1960. Most of the 143 acres that comprised the Marion transmitter site was donated to the Sippican Lands Trust in 1986 and is publicly accessible. Radio Tower Property In 1988, RCA Global Communications sold its WCC receiver site in Chatham and its Forest Beach transmitter site in South Chatham to Western Union International, a subsidiary of MCI Communications, as part of the breakup of RCA. Ten years later, MCI/Worldcom sold the WCC sites‚Äînearly 100 acres in total‚Äîto the town of Chatham for a fraction of their value. In 1993, WCC became a remotely controlled station, using fiber optic cable to receive signals, transmit signals and issue such commands such as rotating WCC's directional antennas. Even the keying of Morse Code (CW) and Radioteletype (RTTY) was issued remotely at this early date in the public internet's infancy. WCC was operated from KPH Radio in Point Reyes, California until its closing. The Chatham WCC receiver site is now the Chatham Marconi Maritime Center, and the home of amateur radio station WA1WCC, licensed to the WCC Amateur Radio Association. The South Chatham transmitter site is now preserved as open space. The callsign WCC is now used by Globe Wireless for a Maryland station it operates to transmit automated e-mail-by- radio. The station was the subject of the Mooncusser Films documentary Chatham Radio: WCC the Untold Story, narrated by Walter Cronkite and directed by Christopher Seufert.

Witness accounts suggest that events were initiated after a rain shelter collapsed, which worshipers mistakenly took to be a landslide. There were as many as 3000 devotees at the temple because it was a sacred place (called a \\"Shakti Peeth\\") in the holy month of Shraavana of the Hindu Calendar. According to Daljit Singh Manhas, a senior police officer from the area, at least 40 of the victims were children. The Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh, Prem Kumar Dhumal, announced a government compensation of Rs. 100,000 (approximately US$2500) for those who died and Rs. 50,000 (approximately US$1250) for the seriously injured. 50,000 people had been expected to attend Naina Devi during the day of the stampede, as part of a nine-day festival which had just started. The pilgrimage resumed on the next day, 4 August 2008. Gaurav Singh Saini, a 13-year-old boy from Tohana (a town located near Haryana-Punjab border) Haryana, saved 50-60 people during the stampede, and received the Bharat Award, the highest award at the 2009 National Bravery Awards. Stampede Devotees standing in a queue initially saw the collapse of a rain shelter. This triggered a false cry of \\"landslide!\\" as it was raining on the day of the stampede. People reportedly tried to move outside the railings put up by the police for crowd control, but the police refused to allow any more movements. The railings later collapsed and people fell on each other, starting the stampede. Reaction Naina Devi Temple The Naina Devi guard rail was much like this one. Rajnath Singh, the current leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party in India, responded to the stampede by releasing a statement in the hours after the disaster. \\"I am deeply saddened to learn about the tragic death of over 100 pilgrims. I convey my deep felt condolences to the family members of all those who have lost their lives or have been injured in the incident,\\" he said. Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal responded by announcing an inquiry into the incident. The Vice President of India, Hamid Ansari, and the Speaker of Lok Sabha, Somnath Chatterjee, conveyed condolences to the families of those killed and injured in the incident. The Tribune criticized the poor infrastructure and ill- maintained roads at the shrine, reporting that a team of doctors and paramedics were unable to reach the site of the accident until hours after the stampede. The Times of India observed that there had been no improvement in crowd management even though a similar stampede took place in the shrine in 1978 after rumors of a landslide spread, killing 65 people. As is often the case during disasters, the mobile telephone network around Naina Devi had insufficient capacity to serve the large number of phone calls by worried relatives. Post-mortem report of victims Post-mortem examinations conducted on victims of the Naina Devi temple stampede confirmed that the deaths were caused by asphyxiation. Post-mortem reports of 101 bodies out of a total of 141 victims taken to the civil hospital at Anandpur Sahib in Punjab, 18 km from the site, have indicated compression of the chest causing asphyxiation and death, Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) P C Akela said. Akela, who remained stationed at Anandpur Sahib after the incident, said post-mortems were not carried out on 40 of the dead at the request of their relatives.

It is bounded on the south by Nantucket Sound, and on the north by Grayton, Edge Hill, and Ocean Avenues. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Until the late 19th century, Hyannis Port was a modest agricultural and seafaring village. The Hyannis Land Company was formed in 1871-72 and engaged in a major resort development push, which was one of the largest such efforts on the Cape. The company purchase most of the oceanfront property between Dunbar's Point and Craigville, and platted out parcels. They built several hotels, staged events to promote the area, and built summer resort houses for vacationers from as far off as Indianapolis and Chicago. The company was not financially sound, however, and went bankrupt in 1879. The area was not fully developed until the first decades of the 20th century. The district does have a few 18th-century houses, but most of its houses are in the styles popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The most famous residents of Hyannis Port, however, are the Kennedy family, whose compound is a National Historic Landmark. Joseph P. and Rose Kennedy purchased the compound's main house in 1926.

The properties lie along Bow Lane and Hyannis Road, between the Old King's Highway and the right-of-way of the Cape Cod Railroad. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The oldest house in the district is that of Deacon Timothy Phinney at 1776 Hyannis Road, built c. 1790. It is a rambling Federal-style house with an attached barn and an attractive Colonial Revival porch. The houses at 2 and 46 Bow Lane are also Federal in styling; the Bacon House at 46 Bow Lane is the most sophisticated of the group, with a five-bay facade and an enclosed center entry. Most of the houses in the district are Greek Revival in style. The Marston House at 8 Bow Lane (c. 1810-23) is a fine example, with a Doric porch and full-length first floor windows on the main facade. By comparison, the adjacent Hallett House at 20 Bow Lane, built about the same time, is more vernacular in its styling.

As the name implies, it deals with topics pertaining to both self and identity. Key areas of investigation include self-concept, self-esteem, and self-control. What distinguishes self and identity as a discipline is its scientific character. Emphasis is placed on the empirical testing of systematic theories about relevant phenomena. Hence, its methodological approach differs from both philosophy and sociology. Self and Identity incorporates elements from different areas of psychology. However, it owes particularly large debt to personality psychology and social psychology. Individual level analysis of the self There are levels of analysis that one can look at self and identity. One level of analysis is the self on the individual level, for example, self-states, self-motives, self- esteem, self-efficacy, etc. Self-states are self-process that include unbiased self-awareness. However, self-motives are more serious impulses to action, something that is innate and societal or cultural analysis of the self. The other level of analysis is on the societal or cultural level, for example, the cultural conception of a person, cultural arrangements that make the person who they are and the cultural concept of self. Self and identity are highly contingent upon culture. In industrialized Western cultures, the concept of self is based solely on independence.  Collective Self-Esteem  The attitude towards social groups has an effect on the individuals self-esteem towards their own group along with other groups. The collective self-esteem that is gathered from each group depends on how they're being treated. If the individual has a low self-esteem, the outlook on other groups can be negative and bonds with other groups can be difficult to manifest in the future. The way minority groups treat each other has this kind of effect within the group while treating other groups negatively depending on the individuals experiences with that group. Despite these group differences, some individuals who have a positive perspective of other minority groups can increase the individuals collective self-esteem, which can progress to what is called cross-group friendships. Cross-group friendships can be described as a positive relationship between the intergroup also referred to as cross-race friendship. \\"We therefore assumed that high-quality cross-group friendships would provide a sense of collective self-esteem among minority group members. In turn, collective self-esteem is likely to fuel collective action tendencies\\". When there is a positivity, high quality relations, and respect amongst these inner groups, this can increase collective self-esteem and collectivity within the community. The psychological well-being will increase amongst the minority groups that share a cross-race friendship. There are different self-esteems that are used depending on the different relations shared with the individual. The relational self pertains to aspects of the self-concept that are rooted in interpersonal attachments and that consists of aspects shared with significant others (e.g., family, friends) and define one's roles in those relationships. The collective self refers to aspects of the self derived from membership from social groups (e.g., ethnic group). These relationships shared from one person to the next can be described as one's self and identity. Self-esteem that is described in this context can change depending on the individuals outlook of life. The friends and family can be a contributing factor to the high or low self-esteem seen from each person. Social identity can relate to collective self-esteem because both relate to how the individual contributes to the group they belong to. Being able to understand the role one takes within their group might it be an ethnic group, social class, or some other group that one belongs to, the individual does what is necessary to improve their own collective self-esteem. Having a connection to other groups can contribute to some change might it be positive or negative depending on the collective self-esteem that has been manifested by the individual.

Early life He was the son of an elder Alexander of Seleucia in Cilicia (modern Silifke, Turkey).Philostratus, Lives of the Sophists ii. 5. ~ 1, compared with Epist. Apollon. Tyan. 13, where the father of Alexander Peloplaton is called \\"Straton\\", which, however, may be a mere surname. His father was distinguished as a pleader in the courts of justice, by which he acquired considerable property, but he died at an age when his son was too young to care for himself. His place, however, was supplied by his friends, especially by Apollonius of Tyana, who is said to have been in love with Seleucis on account of her extraordinary beauty, in which she was equaled by her son. He spent the property his father had left to him on pleasures, but, says Philostratus, not contemptible pleasures. Education His education was entrusted at first to Aelius Dionysius, but Alexander left when his education was half completed. He later finished his education under the Academic Skeptic philosopher Favorinus, and afterwards was his disciple.Ivars Avotins, Prosopographical and Chronological Notes on Some Greek Sophists of the Empire California Studies in Classical Antiquity Vol. 4 (1971), p 70 https://www.jstor.org/stable/25010614?read- now=1&refreqid;=excelsior%3A323e81020d44d6c4467306af094f98af&seq;=4#page_scan_tab_contents Career When he had attained the age of manhood, the town of Seleucia, for some reason now unknown, sent Alexander as ambassador to the emperor Antoninus Pius, who is said to have ridiculed the young man for the extravagant care he bestowed on his outward appearance. He spent the greater part of his life away from his native place, at Antiochia, Rome, Tarsus, and traveled through all Egypt, as far as Ethiopia. It seems to have been during his stay at Antiochia that he was appointed Greek secretary to the emperor Marcus Aurelius, who was carrying on a war in Pannonia, around the year 174. On his journey to the emperor he made a short stay at Athens, where he met the celebrated rhetorician Herodes Atticus. He had a rhetorical contest with him in which he not only conquered his famous adversary, but gained his esteem and admiration to such a degree that Herodes honored him with an extremely expensive gift. One Corinthian, however, of the name of Sceptes, when asked what he thought of Alexander, expressed his disappointment by saying that he had found \\"the clay (Greek: pelos), but not Plato.\\" This saying gave rise to the surname of Peloplaton. The place and time of his death are not known. Philostratus gives the various statements which he found about these points. Alexander was one of the greatest rhetoricians of his age, and he is especially praised for the sublimity of his style and the boldness of his thoughts; but he is not known to have written anything. An account of his life is given by Philostratus, who has also preserved several of his sayings, and some of the subjects on which he made speeches.Suda s. v. in fin.Eudoc. p. 52 Emperor Marcus Aurelius refers to him in his Meditations as Alexander the Platonic and recounts the following: References Category:Ancient Greek rhetoricians Category:2nd- century Greek people Category:Platonism ","title":"Alexander Peloplaton"},{"id":"18702720","text":"The Capt.

At this location, now in the Cape Cod National Seashore (though no admission is charged if not visiting Marconi Beach), inventor Guglielmo Marconi erected a large antenna array on four wooden towers, and established a transmitting station powered by kerosene engines that produced the 25,000 volts of electricity needed to send signals to a similar station in Poldhu, Cornwall, United Kingdom. The first transmission received in North America by Marconi was at Signal Hill, St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador in 1901; Glace Bay, Nova Scotia was the site of the first such two-way transmission, in 1902. Remains of the Wellfleet station's towers, 2009 One of the station's most notable roles occurred with the sinking of the RMS Titanic in April 1912. Operators at the station were able to alert the RMS Carpathia so that the rescue of some of the Titanic passengers could be effected. The station was shut down in 1917 in part over concerns about its use in World War I, but also because its towers were threatened with erosion. In 1920, usable materials and equipment were removed from the site, and it was abandoned. Erosion has taken its toll over the years since then, and there was little left as of the date of the National Park Service brochure. No trace of the site remains as of September 2014; the sea has claimed it all. Marconi had moved the station to Chatham by 1912 and the Titanic and Carpathia communications were done from there. There is debate of whether the Wellfleet station was ever put into commercial operation. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

The Marston Mills Cemetery was established in 1775, and is the resting place of many of the village's early settlers. It is located on the northwest side of Route 149, between Mistic Drive and Cammett Road. It is still in active use; the oldest graves are nearest the street, and it has an estimated 300-400 burials.

Located at the intersection of Route 23 and Route 100, it is home to the Owen J. Roberts School District's main campus, where both the Owen J. Roberts Middle School and the Owen J. Roberts High School are located. Much like the other surrounding villages in Northern Chester County, Bucktown contains a rich sense of historical architecture dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries. The crossroads features a bustling commercial scene that includes a gas station, 2 banks, a church, several restaurants, a car dealership, auto mechanic, and hair salon. A large dairy farm named Ridglea Farms used to exist just next to Bucktown. The farm consisted of a dairy store, restaurant and farm. However, in the year 2000, the land that was farmed by Lester High for many years was sold to the development company Realan Properties, who built a large-scale development. The plans included 161 homes as well as an assisted living facility. Bucktown took its name from Buck Tavern which stood upon one of the corners since 1790. In 1883 it had only six houses and a hotel.

The white clapboard church was built in the town of Yarmouth, and moved to Marstons Mills in 1830. Its small belfry tower was added sometime between 1888 and 1908, around the same time it acquired some of its Queen Anne stylistic elements. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 for its architecture and for its role in community history. Description and history The Marstons Mills Community Church is set on the south side of Main Street, a short way northeast of its junction with Cotuit Road (Massachusetts Route 149). It is a single-story wood-frame structure with a front-gable roof and clapboard siding. A gable-roofed entry vestibule projects from the main facade, with a double-door frame by a simple surround and a fully pedimented gable. The square church tower rises partly through the vestibule and partly through the main block, with a series of sections, some stepped in and others stepped out, and a belfry stage that has paired round- arch louvers on each side, and is topped by a flared pyramidal roof and weathervane. The windows flanking the vestibule have decorative sashes, a Queen Anne embellishment also appearing on the door windows. The Methodist congregation of Marstons Mills was organized in 1826, although there had been less formal meetings in private spaces at least as early as 1819. This church building was hauled by oxen from Yarmouth in 1830 to serve as its sanctuary. Over the 150 years it went through a number of alterations, the most visible being the addition of Queen Anne styling to the tower and of a surplus military barracks as a parish hall. In 1968 the Marstons Mills congregation merged with that of Osterville, and this building was closed. It was revived in 1981 as the nondenominational Marstons Mills Community Church.

However, although the historic sources describe this as having taken place in the \\"Western Isles\\" which are now known as the Outer Hebrides, all of the aforementioned locations are actually in the Inner Hebrides. It was fought between the Clan Macdonald of Sleat and Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg against the Clan Maclean. In 1585, the Macleans slaughtered a party of the MacDonalds of Sleat when they were mistakenly accused of stealing cattle and the MacDonalds of Sleat and Dunnyveg retaliated. James VI of Scotland intervened but the conflicts continued into 1586. After further intervention an Act of Parliament was passed which would levy fines on any clan chiefs who did not maintain peace and good order among their vassals. The conflict on Jura In the summer of 1585, Donald Gorm Mor of Sleat, chief of the Clan Macdonald of Sleat, along with a large following of men, left the Isle of Skye to pay a visit to Angus MacDonald of Islay, chief of the Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg. However, because of a severe storm he was forced to seek shelter on the north of the Isle of Jura, which part belonged to Lachlan Mor Maclean, chief of Clan Maclean, who was seated at Duart Castle on the Isle of Mull. Another party, which included Hugh, son of Archibald the Clerk and a Macdonald descendant of Donald Herrach, were also driven by the same storm to Jura. These two men collected a large amount of cattle belonging to the Macleans who lived near to the place that Donald Gorm Mor had landed, and carried them off in their galleys. Their objective was to get Donald Gorm Mor into trouble. They knew that the Macleans would believe that the theft was committed by Donald Gorm Mor and hoped that the Macleans would attack him and put him to death. The men whose cattle had been stolen went straight to Lachlan Mor Maclean to make their complaint. Lachlan Mor Maclean sailed to Jura with a number of men and made a sudden attack on Donald Gorm Mor, who had no idea what had taken place. In the battle he killed sixty of the MacDonalds, but the rest of them, including Donald Gorm Mor, made their escape. The punishment that Lachlan Mor Maclean inflicted was monstrous. Donald Gorm Mor then made his way to Skye, fully resolved to take vengeance on the Macleans. He dispatched messengers to the chieftains of the various branches of the Clan Donald, calling upon them to assist him in the attack. Lachlan Mor Maclean having killed a number of innocent men created feelings of indignation and vengeance among all the MacDonalds who committed acts of depredation on his lands in various quarters and threatened to invade the Isle of Mull. They did find out that the cattle had actually been stolen by two MacDonalds but still felt so indignant over the slaughter of their clansmen that they were unwilling to come to terms with Lachlan Mor Maclean. The King's intervention Duart Castle on the Isle of Mull, seat of the chief of the Clan Maclean since the 14th century In September, 1585, James VI of Scotland wrote to the Chief of the Clan MacLeod, seated at Dunvegan Castle, requesting him to assist the Macleans against the MacDonalds and he also urged the MacDonalds at the same time to cease their hostilities. The MacDonalds therefore resolved to settle their disputes in a peaceful manner. In the spring of 1586, Angus MacDonald of Islay went to Skye to consult with Donald Gorm Mor about a settlement with Lachlan Mor Maclean. On his return he called at Duart Castle to try to come to an amicable settlement with Lachlan Mor Maclean. The following day, Maclean seized both Angus and his attendants and threw them into prison until Angus agreed to renounce his claim to the Rinns of Islay. Angus also had to give his son James, and his brother, Ranald, as hostages to Lachalan until he received the lands as promised. The harsh treatment that Angus received from Maclean meant that he went back to Islay as a bitter enemy. The conflict on Islay, Mull, Tiree and Kintyre In July, 1586, Lachlan Mor Maclean went to Islay to receive possession of the Rinns and took up his quarters at the fort of Lochgorm. He remained there for three days and received repeated invitations from Angus of Islay to visit him at Mullintrea. Maclean yielded and went to spend a night with him. He was accompanied by seventy followers, or according to another account eighty-six. Maclean was received in a friendly manner and was entertained in grand style. However, he refused to stay the night with Angus and instead went to sleep in one of the buildings which his followers were lodged in, and took with him, James, the son of Angus who was still a hostage. At midnight, Angus of Islay, with 400 armed followers went to the door of the building where Lachlan Mor Maclean was sleeping and asked him to get up and have a drink with him. Maclean went to the door with the hostage James in one hand and a sword in the other, but saw that it was impossible for him to escape. Angus saw that if a fight took place then his son would certainly be killed. Angus solemnly promised that if they gave up his son and surrendered as prisoners that their lives would be spared. Maclean accepted and so did all but two of his men. These two were John Dubh of Morvern and MacDonald Herrach who was one of the men who had caused the slaughter of the MacDoanlds for having stolen Maclean's cattle. These two men refused to leave the building and so the MacDonalds set fire to it and they perished in the flames. The prisoners were all put to death with the exception of Lachlan Mor Maclean himself. In the history of these events published by Alexander Maclean Sinclair in 1899, he disputes the account given in the book Conflicts of the Clans which was published by the Foulis press in 1764 and which says that Angus executed all of the prisoners in one day. Sinclair states that this happened over a number of days and quotes the Ardgour MS (manuscript) as his source. These atrocities came to the attention of the King who employed the chiefs of the Clan Campbell who governed Argyll during the minority of Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll, to mediate between the contending clans. Angus MacDonald agreed on the condition that he would be pardoned for his crimes as well as for eight hostages to be placed in his hands by Maclean who in turn was forced to subscribe. After this MacDonald went over to Ireland but while he was away, Maclean, disregarding the hostages, invaded Islay with his clan and laid waste with fire and sword. When MacDonald returned he did not punish the hostages but collected a large force and invaded the isles of Mull and Tiree, putting to death all the inhabitants that came into their hands. Meanwhile, Maclean ravaged and plundered Kintyre. Aftermath The Government felt it necessary to take immediate action to suppress these alarming disorders. The King and the Privy Council of Scotland issued a proclamation ordering the hostages to be given up to the young Earl of Argyll, or his guardians, and to be brought by them to the King until the final settlement of the dispute between the MacDonalds and Macleans. The two tribes and their supporters were charged to remain quiet and abstain from gathering in arms, and from attacking each other.Gregory, Donald (1881). p. 236. Quoting: Record of the Privy Council, 16th April, 1587 The King also wrote to the Earl of Huntly asking him to prevent the northern islanders from gathering in arms or committing acts of hostility against each other and that it was his Majesty's intention to take \\"some special paines\\" in the affairs of the Isles as he had recently done in the Borders.Gregory, Donald (1881). pp. 236-237. Quoting: History of the Gordons, by W.R (MS. Advocates Library), in which the letter, dated 20th April, 1587, is quoted verbatim, p. 229 An Act of Parliament was also passed for maintaining good order in both the Borders and Highlands and Isles in which all clan chiefs would have to provide large sureties in accordance with their wealth for the peaceable and orderly behavior of themselves and their vassals.Gregory, Donald (1881). p. 237. Quoting: Acts of the Scottish Parliament, latest edition, III. 461-467 According to the book Conflicts of the Clans, both Angus MacDonald and Lachlan Mor Maclean were committed within the walls of Edinburgh Castle where they remained for only a short time after which they were freed for a small fine and both given a remission, but their eldest sons had to remain as a pledge of their obedience.

Included are the library (c. 1800), old town hall (1926), two buildings currently housing town offices that were originally part of the Hyannis Normal School, and the Crowell/Guyer Barn, a 19th-century structure now used by the local public works department. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The library is housed in a former residence, built c. 1800, which was owned for many years by the Hallett family. It was purchased in 1908 for use as a library, and continues to fulfil that role, albeit with a modern addition to the rear that greatly expands its capacity. The Crowell/Guyer Barn is a 1-1/2 wood frame structure with a front- gable roof that has decorative brackets under the eaves. It was built c. 1865, and its earliest documented owner was Captain Sidney Crowell, a ship master active in the coasting trade. The \\"Old Town Hall\\" is a neo-Federal two story brick building, with a five-bay main block flanked by symmetrical single-story wings. Its entry is distinguished by a semi-circular portico supported by Corinthian columns. It was built in 1926 to replace the previous town hall, located in West Barnstable, that was built in 1899. It served as town hall until 1979, when the former buildings of the Hyannis Normal School were acquired to house town offices. The two surviving buildings (out of three originally built) of the Hyannis Normal School were designed by Hartwell, Richardson and Driver, and built in 1897 after the state awarded Hyannis the location of a new normal school. The main building and former dormitory are large brick three-story buildings (one is eleven bays wide, the other thirteen), with slate hip roofs. They were used (along with the training school, an elementary school building that has not survived) until the school closed in 1944. After serving a variety of other purposes, they were acquired by the town in 1979. The former school's open space in front of these buildings now serves as the town green.

It includes thirteen houses, ten on Mill Way and three on adjacent Freezer Road, just north of the Old King's Highway. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Mill Way was the major route between the center of Barnstable and its port area from its very earliest days. Agriculture dominated the village until later in the 18th century, with a grist mill located to make use of the local tides for its power. In the 19th century the port area grew as a shipbuilding and salt production center, and some of the district's buildings reflect this heritage. The oldest house in the district is the David Bursley House (35 Mill Way), built c. 1750; it is a 2-1/2 story four-bay house with side gable roof, and wood shingle siding. It was supposedly built as a single-story cottage, which was then raised on ship masts to build a new ground floor underneath. The 1797 Maraspin House (200 Mill Way) is a fairly typical five-bay Cape cottage, whose property in 1835 included two wharves, a store, barn, mill, salthouse, and other outbuildings. The Stetson Cottage is one of the few buildings in the district with significant later alteration.

These reports were the result of internal or presidential studies, external investigations by congressional committees or other arms of the Federal government of the United States, or even the simple releases and declassification of large quantities of documents by the CIA. Several investigations led by the Church Committee, Rockefeller Commission and Pike Committee, as well as released declassified documents, reveal that the CIA, at times, operated outside its charter. In some cases, such as during Watergate, this may have been due to inappropriate requests by White House staff. In other cases, there was a violation of Congressional intent, such as the Iran-Contra affair. In many cases, these reports provide the only official discussion of these actions available to the public. 1949 Eberstadt Report (First Hoover Commission) The first major analysis, following the National Security Act of 1947, was chaired by former President Herbert Hoover, with a Task Force on National Security Organization under Ferdinand Eberstadt, one of the drafters of the National Security Act and a believer in centralized intelligence. The task force concluded that the system of the day led to an adversarial relationship, with little effective coordination, among the CIA, the military, and the State Department. \\"In the opinion of the task force, this produced duplication on one hand, and, on the other, departmental intelligence estimates that \\"have often been subjective and biased.\\" In large measure, the military and State Department were blamed for their failure to consult and share pertinent information with the CIA. The task force recommended \\"that positive efforts be made to foster relations of mutual confidence between the [CIA] and the several departments and agencies that it serves.\\" This report stressed that the CIA \\"must be the central organization of the national intelligence system.\\" It recommended a \\"... top echelon [of] an evaluation board or section composed of competent and experienced personnel who would have no administrative responsibilities and whose duties would be confined solely to intelligence evaluation.\\" It also favored a civilian DCI with a long term in office. > In the arena of covert operations and clandestine intelligence, the > Eberstadt Report supported the integration of all clandestine operations > into one office within CIA, under NSC supervision. To alleviate concerns > expressed by the military who viewed this proposal as encroaching upon their > prerogatives, the report stated that clandestine operations should be the > responsibility of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) in time of war. The report declared that the failure to appraise scientific advances (e.g., biological and chemical warfare, electronics, aerodynamics, guided missiles, atomic weapons, and nuclear energy) in hostile countries might have more immediate and catastrophic consequences than failure in any other field of intelligence. It urged the US to develop a centralized capability for tracking these developments. 1949 Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report The Eberstadt report was soon eclipsed by what may have been the most influential policy paper. \\"On January 8, 1948, the National Security Council established the Intelligence Survey Group (ISG) to \\"evaluate the CIA's effort and its relationship with other agencies.\\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-IC21/html/GPO- IC21-18.html Appendix C. CRS Report: Proposals for Intelligence Reorganization 1949-1996The Jackson-Dulles-Correa report held an opposite view on clandestine collection to the Eberstadt Report, interesting in that Dulles was a clandestine collection specialist. Like the Hoover Commission, this group was chartered at the request of President Truman, and was made up of Allen W. Dulles, who had served in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during the Second World War and would become DCI in 1953, William Jackson, a future Deputy DCI, and Matthias Correa, a former assistant to Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal when the latter had served as Secretary of the Navy during the war. Chaired by Dulles, the ISG presented its findings, known as the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report, to the National Security Council on January 1, 1949. Partially declassified in 1976, it \\"contained fifty-six recommendations, many highly critical of the CIA and DCI. In particular, the report revealed problems in the agency's execution of both its intelligence and operational missions. It also criticized the quality of national intelligence estimates by highlighting the CIA's‚Äîand, by implication, the DCI's--\\"failure to take charge of the production of coordinated national estimates.\\" The report went on to argue that the CIA's current trend in clandestine intelligence activities should be reversed in favor of its mandated role as coordinator of intelligence.\\" It was \\"particularly concerned about the personnel situation at CIA, including internal security, the high turnover of employees, and the excessive number of military personnel assigned to the agency.\\" See the continuing concern about personnel in the 1954 Doolittle Report To add \\"continuity of service\\" and the \\"greatest assurance of independence of action,\\" the report argued that the DCI should be a civilian and that military appointees be required to resign their commissions. As with the Eberstadt Report, the Dulles Report also expressed concern about the inadequacies in scientific intelligence and the professionalism of the service intelligence organizations, and urged that the CIA provide greater coordination. This led to a recommendation for increased coordination between the DCI and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the arena of counterespionage. In turn, the report recommended that the Director of FBI be elevated to membership in the committee to help the DCI coordinate intelligence and set intelligence requirements. The report proposed a large- scale reorganization of CIA. Even though it emphasized intelligence analysis and coordination over operations, it > suggested incorporating covert operations and clandestine intelligence into > one office within CIA. ... the Office of Special Operations (OSO), > responsible for the clandestine collection of intelligence, and the Office > of Policy Coordination (OPC), responsible for covert actions, be integrated > into a single division within CIA. [It] recommended replacing existing > offices with four new divisions for coordination, estimates, research and > reports, and operations. The heads of the new offices would be included in the immediate staff of the DCI so that he would have \\"intimate contact with the day-to-day operations of his agency and be able to give policy guidance to them.\\" These recommendations would become the start of the model for the future organization and operation of the present-day CIA. Until the DNI creation, estimates were in a separate office reporting to the DCI, coordination was a job of the DDCI (later assisted by the Intelligence Community Staff), research and reports became the Directorate of Intelligence, and operations was first, euphemistically, called the Directorate of Plans. Directorates for Support (originally called Administration), and Science & Technology, were also created. 1954 Doolittle Report on Covert Activities Gen. James Doolittle did an extensive report on covert actions, specifically for President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The report's first recommendation dealt with personnel. It recommended releasing a large number of current staff that could never be more than mediocre, aggressively recruit new staff with an overall goal of increasing the workforce, and intensify training, with 10% of the covert staff time spent in training. The Director should be nonpolitical. Security was the next concern, starting with a drive to reduce interim and provisional security clearances. The report strongly endorsed use of the polygraph both for initial recruits and existing staff. Counterespionage needed to be strengthened, and field stations needed both to report on their staff and periodically be inspected. Consolidating the Washington workforce, which was scattered among buildings, into one or a few main buildings was seen as a way of improving the security of classified information. Coordination in the intelligence community was seen as a problem, especially agreeing on clear understandings between CIA and military intelligence organizations. The overall IC program for eliciting information from defectors needed improvement, with contributions from multiple agencies. As far as organization and management, the report described the structure of the Directorate of Plans (i.e., the clandestine service) as too complex and in need of simplification. The Inspector General needed an agency-wide mandate. The role of the Operations Coordinating Board, the covert and clandestine oversight staff of the National Security Council needed to be strengthened, with operations clearly approved and guided from the highest levels of government. The report addressed the classic problem of increasing performance while reducing costs. This meant better review of the budgets of covert and clandestine activities by a Review Board, except for the most sensitive operations. It meant providing the Comptroller with enough information, even if sanitized, to do a thorough job. 1956 Bruce-Lovett Report Soon after President Dwight D. Eisenhower created the President's Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Actitivites, that Board requested that Robert A. Lovett and David K.E. Bruce examine CIA's covert operations. This information comes from Arthur Schlesinger's book about Robert F. Kennedy. The CIA itself would like more detail on this report, a copy of which could not be found, in 1995, by the Agency's History Staff. Referring to reports such as the Dulles- Jackson-Correa, Doolittle, Pike, Church, and Rockefeller reports, the Staff \\"recently ran across a reference to another item, the so-called \\"Bruce-Lovett\\" report, that it would very much like to read‚Äîif we could find it! The report is mentioned in Peter Grose's recent biography Gentleman Spy: The Life of Allen Dulles. According to Grose, [Bruce and Lovett] prepared a report for President Dwight Eisenhower in the fall of 1956 that criticized CIA's alleged fascination with \\"kingmaking\\" in the Third World and complained that a \\"horde of CIA representatives\\" was mounting foreign political intrigues at the expense of gathering hard intelligence on the Soviet Union. The History Staff checked the CIA files on the President's Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities (PBCFIA). They checked with the Eisenhower Library. They checked with the National Archives, which holds the PBCFIA records. They checked with the Virginia Historical Society, the custodian of David Bruce's papers. None had a copy. > Having reached a dead end, we consulted the author of the Dulles biography, > Peter Grose. Grose told us that he had not seen the report itself but had > used notes made from it by historian Arthur M. Schlesinger for Robert F. > Kennedy and His Times (1978). Professor Schlesinger informed us that he had > seen the report in Robert Kennedy's papers before they were deposited at the > John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston.

In his book, Legacy of Ashes, Tim Weiner published a \\"declassified version of the document\\" in the book's footnotes.See footnote from 154, \\"His top secret report\\", beginning on page 667, https://books.google.com/books?id=vf9ZJx8WkjQC&lpg;=PA667&ots;=72wa_qgLgo&dq;=David%20Bruce%20and%20Robert%20Lovett%20report%20cia&pg;=PA667#v=onepage&q;&f;=false 1975 investigations The 1975 United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States, better known as the Rockefeller Commission investigated questionable practices including assassination attempts and inappropriate domestic operations. Larger Congressional investigations followed in 1975, first the Church Committee of the United States Senate, followed by the Pike Committee of the United States House of Representatives. Eventually, these interim committees were replaced by the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. 1996 reports Congress merged divergent proposals from studies of the Aspin‚ÄìBrown Commission (successively chaired by former Secretaries of Defense Les Aspin and Harold Brown, and whose members were mostly appointed by President Bill Clinton) and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (chaired by Republican Larry Combest of Texas) in crafting the Intelligence and Defense Authorization Acts for fiscal year 1997, enacting them as amendments to the National Security Act of 1947. The revised Act now gave the DCI a new DDCI for Community Management, along with three ‚ÄúAssistant Directors of Central Intelligence‚Äù to coordinate collection, administration, and analysis and production. The community‚Äôs imagery interpretation offices were merged in a National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) under the Secretary of Defense. The DCI also received more clout over defense intelligence budgets as well as influence in the appointments of directors of the NSA, NRO, and DIA. 2007 documents On 27 June 2007 the CIA released two collections of previously classified documents which outlined various activities of doubtful legality. The first collection, the \\"Family Jewels,\\" consists of almost 700 pages of responses from CIA employees to a 1973 directive from Director of Central Intelligence James Schlesinger requesting information about activities inconsistent with the Agency's charter. The second collection, the CAESAR-POLO-ESAU papers, consists of 147 documents and 11,000 pages of research from 1953 to 1973 relating to Soviet and Chinese leadership hierarchies, and Sino-Soviet relations.

Life He entered the Order of St. Dominic at a very early age, and after devoting some years to missionary work in the Philippine Islands, accompanied in 1633 a band of Dominican missionaries to China, taking up their work in the province of Fu-kien. Here he took an active part in the Chinese Rites controversy, between the Jesuits on the one side and the Dominicans and Franciscans on the other. The latter maintained that the Jesuits, to make converts, tolerated to a certain extent the cult of Confucius and of ancestors. They despatched Morales to Rome in 1643, and on 12 September 1645, obtained from Pope Innocent X a decision condemning the methods of the Jesuits. The latter also appealed to Rome, and obtained from Pope Alexander VII a contradictory decree. In 1661 Morales again called the attention of the Holy See to the matter, and in 1669, five years after the death of Morales, Pope Clement IX issued a new decree deciding against the Jesuits. About the same time the Dominicans discovered an enemy in their own ranks in the person of the Chinese friar, Gregory Lopez, Bishop of Basilea, who sent to the Holy See a memorandum favourable to the Jesuits.

Fonix Hall holds 8,500 people and opened in 2002. It hosted the 2002 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. The arena was named after the Phoenix, a mythical firebird which is the symbol of Debrecen. F≈ënix hall is the second largest arena in Hungary, the first being Budapest Sports Arena (12,500). Background F≈ënix Hall is located in Debrecen, which is the second largest city of Hungary, in a pleasant environment: close to the Nagyerd≈ë area, near Road 4, along the thoroughfare to Ko≈°ice called Kassai √∫t. Entering the building through the main entrance, one immediately find itself in the arena space. Along one of the longitudinal sides of the amphitheater, there are locker rooms and service facilities for the athletes, while the other side is actually a multifunctional area that can be freely divided with the help of relocatable partition walls. In the city, the demand had long been in the air for a state- of-the-art convention hall/arena with a larger than average seating capacity. The final impulse was provided by the possibility of acting as the host for the 2002 World Championship in Gymnastics. In fact, the plans for an already existing sports hall from the city of Tallinn (Estonia) were adapted to suit the local circumstances. The construction of F≈ënix Hall was completed in eight months. Events Since its inauguration, the hall has acted as the venue for a variety of events (such as ice hockey, indoor soccer, basketball and handball tournaments, hot air balloon and ballroom dancing championships, ballet performances, music concerts, various exhibitions, conferences and even ice shows). The long list of celebrities having performed here ranges from Olympic champion Szilveszter Csoll√°ny and the heavy metal band Iron Maiden or the rock band Deep Purple through the pianist Richard Clayderman to conductor Kobayashi Ken-Ichiro and singer Bryan Adams, including a number of other famous athletes and artists. F≈ënix Hall and Papp L√°szl√≥ Sportar√©na are the two stadiums hosting the 2010 UEFA Futsal Championship in Hungary with the final being played at the F≈ënix Hall. The arena will host the 2024 European Women's Handball Championship and the 2027 World Women's Handball Championship. Facilities The arena proper is fully surrounded with telescope-joint stands (and diagonally turned-in mobile bleachers in the corners). During concerts, the stage actually replaces the stand at the far end of the hall and the entire arena floor is available for the audience to occupy. The props and technical equipment required for the performances can be moved into the arena section through two larger size freight entrances that are 2.5 and 4 meters wide respectively. The gym storeroom next to the gates is accessible from several sides due to the huge sliding doors, and a configuration of several separately lockable storerooms can be arranged if necessary, including rooms for track and field, gymnastics, martial arts, or ice-skating. Even the largest sized apparatuses can be freely moved about. Behind the mobile bleachers, there is a series of other service venues: locker rooms for the athletes, doctors' rooms, changing rooms for the hall personnel, storage rooms, the electric substation room, the gym storeroom, and the fitness room. F≈ënix hall is connected to the adjacent Imre H√≥dos Sports Hall through an underground passageway, so that the facilities could also be used during certain larger events for training or changing purposes or for offices, if necessary. The elevator serves this basement level, too, so the facilities are thus accessible even for mobility impaired athletes.

It is a linear district, extending along Old Main Road south from its junction with Massachusetts Route 28A to Winslow Road. This area gradually developed over the 19th century, principally in support of maritime activities centered on Buzzards Bay to the west. The district contains a cross-section of architectural styles popular from the early 19th to early 20th centuries. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Description and history The North Falmouth area was inhabited by Native Americans roughly until the beginning of the 18th century, when the area was purchased by colonists as part of Falmouth, which had been incorporated in 1686. Among the early settlers were the Nye family, who moved what is probably the district's oldest building, now 96 Old Main Road, to that location in 1762. Of the twenty-four houses known to have been built by Nyes, fourteen are still standing. The area was initially used for agriculture, with maritime pursuits becoming a prominent economic force in the first half of the 19th century. The village's church, the North Village Congregational Church, is a Greek Revival structure built in 1832, and a post office was opened in 1848 in Ferdinand Nye's house at 200 Old Main Road. The district saw a spurt of growth after the railroad came through to the east of Old Main Road in 1872, after which the area saw a gradual transformation into a summer resort area. Other than the church, civic buildings were relatively late in arriving in the village. Megansett Hall was built in 1886 as a community gathering space for social events, and the fire station (now a library) was built in 1915. Two small commercial buildings survive from the 1920s, the Falmouth Superette (279 Old Main) and the Rand Office Block at Country Road.

It includes the two villages of Yarmouth Center and Yarmouthport, which were important 18th and 19th century centers of civic and economic activity. Although the district includes a number of early colonial First Period structures (the oldest being the c, 1690 Timothy Hallett House, 24 Hallett Street), the majority of its buildings date between 1780 and 1860, and are either Federal or Greek Revival in character. There are a number of important early Cape-style homes in the district; these are typically smaller single story buildings, where the later buildings have larger floor plans and are two stories or two and a half stories in height. There are a modest number of houses in styles popular in the second half of the 19th century, including a Gothic Revival house at 134 Hallett Street and Italianate houses at 282 and 364 Hallett. Institutional buildings in the district include three churches, all from the late 19th century; one of them, the First Congregational Church, dates its congregation to the establishment of Yarmouth's first meeting house in 1640. All three buildings are from the later decades of the 19th century. There are three civic buildings: two school buildings (the 1880 Queen Anne Sloyd Building, and the c. 1881 Colonial Revival Lyceum Hall), and the library, an 1870 Gothic Revival structure.

Built in 1897, it was originally located at Nauset Beach near the entrance to Chatham Harbor in Chatham, Massachusetts. It was used by the United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS), and then by its successor, the United States Coast Guard (USCG), as the Old Harbor Coast Guard Station. The station was decommissioned in 1944, abandoned and sold as surplus in 1947, and was used as a private residence for the next twenty-six years. The property returned to Federal ownership in 1973, acquired by the National Park Service as part of the Cape Cod National Seashore. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Two years later, facing the threat of imminent destruction from extreme beach erosion, it was removed, cut in half, and floated by barge to Provincetown. The Park Service rehabilitated it and furnished it as it would have existed during its original use as a turn-of- the-century life-saving station. The Old Harbor U.S. Life Saving Station Museum opened at its new location in 1978. History The Old Harbor Station was built in 1897 by the United States Life-Saving Service. The design for this station was first created by USLSS architect George R. Tolman in 1893 for a prototype station on Lake Superior in Duluth, Minnesota. In all, the USLSS used that same design to build twenty-eight stations in the \\"Duluth style.\\" This style resulted from a gradual evolution to replace the simple pitched- roof structures of 1872, and featured a large truncated, or jerkin-head gable roof. The rectangular floor plan was divided into two sections. One side of the building contained the living space, including a keeper's room, office, kitchen and mess room with sleeping quarters above for crew and rescuees. On the other side was a single-story, two-bay boat room. The Duluth departed even further from the norm by adding a large, rectangular, off-center, four-story lookout tower between the sections on the front of the building. A 1906 postcard captioned, The start of the life-boat, Cape Cod The first keeper was assigned on November 23, 1897. During its first five years of operation, crews from this station rescued 21 persons by surfboat, and extracted an additional 13 people by breeches buoy. The latter would be deployed when the sea was too rough for the surfboat to reach a vessel in distress. In 1915, the USLSS was merged with the United States Revenue Cutter Service to form the United States Coast Guard. The renamed Old Harbor Coast Guard Station (Station #41) continued to operate until it was decommissioned in 1944. It was abandoned and sold as surplus on February 10, 1947, and used as a privately owned residence for the next twenty-six years. In 1973, the station was returned to federal ownership, when the National Park Service acquired it as part of the surrounding Cape Cod National Seashore. That same year, the Historian of the National Park Service nominated the building for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, and it was so added in 1975. In 1977, the former life-saving station was itself rescued from the sea, for the land upon which it stood was about to be reclaimed by the Atlantic Ocean. At present, the land upon which the structure once stood has been washed away, and the site is fully submerged. Approximate locations of Cape Cod wrecks through 1903 Preservation and relocation Nauset Beach, upon which this structure was originally located, is a barrier beach contained within a narrow spit of sand. This barrier beach is a high wave-energy environment that bears the brunt of severe winter storms in the Atlantic Ocean. That makes the location and configuration of the beach extremely variable, due to the natural processes of rapid erosion and accretion of sand. When it was built in 1897, the station was roughly centered upon the spit, with about of beach to both the east and west. In 1910, a survey showed that the beach had grown to on the Atlantic Ocean side of the station. By 1940, the beach on that side had grown to , with dunes. By 1966, however, only of beach separated the building from the high- water line, and by 1977, \\"waves were breaking against the foundation of the Old Harbor Station.\\" It had become clear that the barrier beach was migrating westward. In nominating this station for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, the National Park Service justified the need to preserve this structure: The first half of Old Harbor Station is hoisted from the barge in Provincetown (1978). In the fall of 1977, the National Park Service moved the station by cutting it in half, loading it onto a barge, and floating it to Provincetown. In February 1978, it weathered the record-breaking Blizzard of 1978 while still on the barge in Provincetown Harbor. Later that year, it was reassembled on a new foundation at Race Point Beach, rehabilitated, and opened to the public as a museum park exhibit. In 2008, the station underwent a major rehabilitation, with an allocated budget of $489,000 to perform significant repairs to the interior and exterior of the building. Present-day use left The Park Service has restored and furnished the station as it would have existed at the turn of the twentieth century, complete with the original Race Point surfboat and dory. During the summer season, it is open to the public daily as a self-guided museum exhibit each afternoon. Admission is included with standard beach access fees. In addition, every Thursday in July and August at 6 p.m. Park Rangers conduct a live demonstration to reenact the historic \\"Beach Apparatus Drill\\", a weekly exercise used by the United States Life-Saving Service to train for the rescue of shipwrecked mariners. The drill includes deployment of a breeches buoy to effect a rescue.

It encompasses Barnstable's entire length of what is now designated Massachusetts Route 6A and called Main Street, between the town lines of Sandwich and Yarmouth. It includes more than , and includes all of the buildings whose properties front on the road, nearly 500 in all. The area includes the main population centers of Barnstable from its founding in the late 1630s until the mid-19th century, when the southern parts of the community became more significant in economic prominence. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The oldest buildings in the district are the Allyn House (2730 Main Street), built in the late 1600s, and the Old Jail, built c. 1690. The Old Jail is the oldest wooden jail in the United States, and is now part of a museum complex including the Old Customshouse. Both the jail and the customshouse are also separately listed on the National Register. The 1763 county courthouse, at 3046 Rt. 6A, was the scene of an historic mass protest on Sept. 27, 1774, against British efforts to punish Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party the previous year. The protesters demanded that county officials refuse to obey the Massachusetts Government Act, passed by the British Parliament in May 1774, which stripped the colony of its long-held rights of self-government. County officials agreed, and Royal control of the county was effectively ended.The Annals of Barnstable County, Vol. 1, Frederick Freeman,1858 The building was converted to a church in 1842. Because of the shift of Barnstable's economy to more maritime concerns based in villages along its southern coast beginning in the early 19th century, the villages along the King's Highway gradually declined in economic importance, with an resultant decline in construction. As a result, the district has a large number of Federal and Greek Revival properties. Barnstable Village, stretched out along the highway, remained the civic administrative center of the county, even though town offices were eventually moved to Hyannis. The Barnstable County Courthouse, built in 1831, is one of the landmarks of the area's importance in county administration.

Hagiography, biography=Ancient writings St. Tha√Øs reportedly lived during the fourth century in Roman Egypt. Her story is included in hagiographic literature on the lives of the saints in the Greek church. Two such biographical sketches exist. The first, in Greek, perhaps originated during the fifth century. It was translated into Latin as the Vita Thaisis [Life of Tha√Øs] by Dionysius Exiguus (Dennis the Little) during the sixth or seventh century. The other sketch comes to us in medieval Latin from Marbod of Rennes (d. 1123). Tha√Øs also appears in Greek martyrologies by Maurolychus and Greven, however, not in Latin martyrologies. The lives of the desert saints and hermits of Egypt, including St. Tha√Øs, were collected in the Vitae Patrum (Lives of the Desert Fathers).An early modern, scholarly edition of the Vitae Patrum exists, produced by Heribert Rosweyde: De vita et vebis seniorum librix, historiam eremiticam complectentes (Antwerp: Plantin 1615); reprinted in Patrologia Latina, at volumes 73-74.R.H.Robbin Library, Camelot Project. Modern sources There has emerged a modern theory that suggests she is a legend deriving from \\"probably only a moral tale invented for edification.\\"Donald Attwater (compiler), A Dictionary of Saints (London: Burns and Oates 1938), revised and edited by John Cumming as A New Dictionary of Saints (Collegeville, Minnesota: Liturgical Press 1994) at 299. This view is based in part on the 1903 essay by Pierre Batiffol. The saint shares her name with another Tha√Øs of wide notoriety in the Hellenistic world, many hundreds of years before. Of Ancient Athens, she had traveled to Persia with the campaign of Alexander.Cf., Diodorus of Sicily, his Bibliotheca historica at XVII, 72. Notwithstanding, St. Tha√Øs remains on the Calendar of the Catholic Church, with her feast day October 8.Cf., Attwater & Cumming (compilers, editors), A New Dictionary of Saints (1994) at 299 (feast day of St. Tha√Øs), and at 6 (Church Calendar). The Calendar was reformed in 1969. In 1901 the Egyptologist Albert Gayet (1856‚Äì1916) announced the discovery near Antino√´ in Egypt of the mummified remains of St. Tha√Øs and of Bishop S√©rapion. The two mummies were exhibited at the Mus√©e Guimet in Paris. Shortly thereafter he qualified his identification, leaving open the possibility that the remains were not those of these two saints.Cf., Albert Gayet, Antino√´ et les S√©pultures de Tha√Øs et S√©rapion (Paris: Societ√© Fran√ßaise d'√âditions d'Art 1902). Accounts of her life Tha√Øs is first briefly described as wealthy and beautiful, a courtesan living in the cosmopolitan city of Alexandria. Yet in the eyes of the church she was a public sinner. Tha√Øs, however, makes inquiries about the Christian religion and eventually converts. In her Vita a monk in disguise pays for entry into her chambers in order to challenge her and convert her, yet he finds that she already believes in God, from whom nothing is hidden. The identity of this person who instructs and offers Tha√Øs ways of spiritual transformation is unclear, three names being mentioned: St. Paphnutius (Egyptian Bishop in Upper Theba√Ød),Or the saint Paphnutius the Ascetic of the Egyptian desert. St. Bessarion (disciple of St. Anthony in the Egyptian desert), and St. Serapion (Bishop in the Nile Delta).Attwater & Cumming, A New Dictionary of Saints (1994) at 299 (St. Tha√Øs), 244 (St. Paphnutius), 54 (St. Bessarion), 285 (St. Serapion).Alban Butler, The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs and other principal Saints (London 1756-1759), 4 volumes, at vol. 4, pg. 61. Cf., revision by Donald Attwater, Butler's Lives of the Saints (Christian Classics 1956), 4 volumes. Following her acceptance into the Church, Tha√Øs is shown a convent cell where she is provisioned for three years. During her years of solitude she performs penance for her sins. When she later emerges, it is said, she lives among the nuns of the Egyptian desert only for a brief period of fifteen days, before she dies.Cf., Benedicta Ward, Harlots of the Desert. A study of repentance in early monastic sources (Kalamazoo, Michigan: Cistercian Publications 1989), which includes modern translations of these Egyptian lives. In art and literature=TraditionalChurch renderings= Traditional pictures of Tha√Øs show her in two different scenes: * Burning her treasures and ornaments. *Praying in a convent cell, with a scroll on which is written \\"Thou who didst create me have mercy on me.\\" =Medieval play by Hrotsvitha= Hrotsvitha of Gandersheim (935-1002), a Benedictine Canoness of Saxony (northwest Germany), wrote in Latin the play Paphnutius in which St. Tha√Øs appears. Despite the title, she is the principal character of interest. The play, of course, places the story in a European dress and within a medieval European spirituality. Here is St. PaphnutiusEither Paphnutius of Thebes or Paphnutius the Ascetic. addressing the abbess of the desert convent, concerning care for their new convert Tha√Øs: :I have brought you a half-dead little she-goat, recently snatched from the teeth of wolves. I hope that by your compassion [her] shelter will be insured, and that by your care, [she] will be cured, and that having cast aside the rough pelt of a goat she will be clothed with the soft wool of the lamb.Katherina M.

Modern culture After the distinctive artistic lead of Gustave Flaubert (1821‚Äì1880) in his La tentation de Saint Antoine (1874),Gustave Flaubert, La tentation de Saint Antoine (Paris: Charpentier et Cie 1874), translated as The Temptation of Saint Anthony (Paris: H. S. Nicols 1895). there eventually followed, in a decidedly more skeptical, yet still historic-religious vein, the French novel Tha√Øs (1890). This inspired the French opera Tha√Øs (1894). Later followed the London play Thais (1911), the Hollywood film Thais (1917), and the Franco- Rumanian statue Tha√Øs (1920s). =Novel by France= France's Tha√Øs is an historical novel published at Paris in 1891 and written by Anatole France (1844‚Äì1924). Tha√Øs was translated into 18 languages. When France died, \\"he was almost certainly the most admired author in the Western world,\\" yet since then his approach became dated, and his reputation fell.Wayne C. Booth, \\"Introduction\\" to Anatole France, Thaƒ©s (University of Chicago 1976), translated by Basia Gulati, pp. 1-24, at 8-12. Paphnuce is an ascetic hermit of the Egyptian desert, yet he appears to be a fanatic. He determines to convert Thais, a libertine beauty whom he knew as a youth, and journeys to Alexandria to find her. Masquerading as a dandy, he is able to speak with her about eternity; surprisingly he succeeds in converting her to Christianity. Yet on their return to the desert he is troubled and fascinated by her former life. Tha√Øs enters a convent to repent of her sins, under the care of the elderly nun Albina. Paphnuce returns to his desert hut and fellow cenobites, but encounters emptiness and is haunted by \\"a little jackal\\". He rests uneasy and cannot forget the pull of her famous beauty. Later, as she is dying and can only see heaven opening before her, he comes to her side and tells her that her faith is an illusion, and that he loves her.Anatole France, Tha√Øs (Paris 1891, revised edition 1921); English translations: Modern Library 1926; University of Chicago 1976.More so than Gustave Flaubert, the modernist Anatole France was skeptical about religion. His novel Tha√Øs seems to celebrate eros at the expense of transcendent values, taking grim satisfaction in disclosing hypocrisy, yet sympathetic with his character's confused self- understanding. Anatole France had a \\"liberal slant\\" combined with \\"bitter wit, staunch skepticism, and urban cynicism\\". Jean Asta, \\"About the author Anatole France\\" (2012), which introduces an English translation of his novel Tha√Øs, at digireads.com. =Opera by Massenet= Mary Garden performs in the Massenet opera Tha√Øs. Massenet's Tha√Øs is an opera \\"com√©die lyrique\\" first performed March 16, 1894, at the Op√©ra Garnier in Paris. The music by Jules Massenet (1842‚Äì1912) employs the prose libretto written by Louis Gallet (1835‚Äì1898). It draws on the novel by Anatole France. Massenet's music was termed romantic, his being melodic, seductive, poetic, melancholy, \\"traits of the French lyric theater at its best\\".Milton Cross and David Ewen, Encyclopedia of the great Composers and their Music (New York: Doubleday 1953), Massenet: pp. 464-470, Tha√Øs at 469-470; descriptive word \\"Massenetique\\" at 467. The opera omits the novel's skeptical chapter on the vanity of philosophy. The hermit's name was changed to Athana√´l, who is presented with greater sympathy than in the novel. The first duet between Athana√´l and Tha√Øs contrasts his stern accents and her raillery. The last scene's duet shows a reversal of r√¥les, in which the pious and touching phrases of Tha√Øs transcend the despairing ardour of Athana√´l. Chants of desolation, and later, return of the beautiful violin from an earlier symphonic m√©ditation (first played during the intermezzo when Tha√Øs had converted) complete the final effect.Gustave Kobb√©, The Complete Opera Book (New York: Putnam 1919, 1935), Tha√Øs at 731-736, 735-736 (final duet).Cf., Clair Rowden, Republican Morality and Catholic Tradition in the Opera. Massenet's H√©rodiade and Tha√Øs (Weinsberg: Lucie Galland 2004). =Play by Wilstach= Wilstach's Thais is a play performed at the Criterion Theatre in London, March 14 through April, 1911 (31 performances). Written by the American Paul Wilstach (1870-1952), it starred Constance Collier (1878‚Äì1955) playing the title role and Tyrone Power, Sr. (1869‚Äì1931) as the hermit. Earlier the play had a trial run in Boston.Cf., New York Times February 10, 1911, at page 7 (about the play's trial run in Boston). This modern production follows a millennium after the play about Tha√Øs by Hrotsvitha (935-1002). =Film by Goldwyn= Goldwyn's Thais is a Hollywood film which featured the operatic soprano Mary Garden (1874‚Äì1967). Earlier she had performed the title role in Massenet's opera Tha√Øs at l'Op√©ra Comique of Paris. The film, produced by Samuel Goldwyn (1879‚Äì1974), also drew on the novel by Anatole France. The film script, however, contains added scenes in which Paphnutius, not yet a monk, encounters Tha√Øs. These extra scenes occur before the start of France's work of fiction.IMDb: Tha√Øs (1917). The film was evidently not considered a success. Between 1911 and 1917 there were apparently five silent movies entitled Tha√Øs, made in France, Italy, and America, yet not all followed the saint's story.E.g., the Italian film of 1917‚Äì1918 entitled Tha√Øs was about contemporary figures with no apparent relation to the life of St. Tha√Øs. =Ballet: Pavlova, Ashton= Meditation from 'Tha√Øs' is a ballet pas de deux to the music of Jules Massenet. In Anna Pavlova's repertoire of the early 20th century, the piece had been very popular across Europe. Mikhail Mordkin was her dance partner. Later this \\"oriental dream sequence\\" was choreographed by Frederick Ashton and performed by Antoinette Sibley and Anthony Dowell at a 1971 benefit gala held at the Adelphi Theatre, London.Horst Koegler, The concise Oxford dictionary of ballet (Friedrichs 1972; Oxford University 1977) p.356. =Sculpture by Chiparus= The Tha√Øs of Chiparus is a bronze and ivory statue depicting a dancing figure, an elegant young woman in 'ancient' dress. It was crafted in France (with a limited production run) during the Art Deco era by the Rumanian artist Demetre Chiparus (1886‚Äì1947).Height 21\\", width 23\\", depth 7\\". Art Deco sculpture \\"Thais\\" by Chiparus . Retrieved 7 January 2013. It is unclear, however, whether the figure here represents St. Tha√Øs of Egypt before her conversion (cf. France's novel), or the earlier Tha√Øs of Ancient Greece. =The Salt Roads= Thais appears as one of three protagonists in Nalo Hopkinson's The Salt Roads (2003).

The house was built in 1868 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. History The house was built by Edward Penniman (1831‚Äì1913). When Edward Penniman was growing up, it was possible to catch whales directly from the seashore, a practice the Indians perfected using the shallow marsh waters to scare herds of blackfish onto the beaches. Attracted by the profits to be made as a whaler, he ran to sea at age eleven and at 29 he was master of his own whaling ship. He took his wife with him on his travels, and the addition of 3 children to his household did not deter him from trips lasting up to four years. His youngest daughter suffered from seasickness and was sent to live with an aunt. It is the family correspondence with this daughter that makes the Penniman house so interesting, as it brings the daily life of a whaling captain into perspective. On retirement in 1868, Captain Penniman built this unusual house with plans he designed himself, including a modern toilet and bath with hot running water. From the cupola he would watch his extended family play in the surrounding fields, while on the lookout for ships. His daughter took many pictures of impromptu family gatherings, including a picture of her mother in pants. Irma Knowles Penniman Broun sold the Penniman estate to the Cape Cod National Seashore.

It is a chick-lit novel by Sophie Kinsella, a pseudonym of Madeline Wickham. It follows the story of Becky Bloomwood and her boyfriend (later fianc√©) Luke Brandon as they become engaged and plan their wedding. Plot synopsis The book opens with Becky living with her boyfriend Luke in Manhattan's West Village. She has finally found her career calling as a personal shopper at Barney‚Äôs and is happily helping her best friend, Suze plan her wedding. Becky's best friend, Danny, helps her make a bridesmaid's dress. That night, Luke, Danny and Becky discuss when Becky will get married. She replies that she will get married in ten years, much to Luke's disbelief and amusement. A few days before the wedding, Becky learns that Suze is pregnant. Becky is shocked when she catches Suze‚Äôs bouquet and finds a marriage proposal from Luke in it. Suddenly, she finds herself caught in the middle between her mother and Luke‚Äôs mother Elinor, both of whom want to throw her a lavish wedding, one at her childhood home in England and one at the Plaza Hotel in New York on the same day. On one hand, Becky wanted to get married at home. On the other, she wanted to have a gorgeous wedding at the Plaza, and being the 'special, glossy' person for the day. As she sees more and more preparations done on both sides, it's even more difficult for her to say no to either one. If Becky gives up the Plaza, she'll have to pay a penalty of a hundred thousand. Becky has no way of paying - and she can't possibly ask Luke or else he will get suspicious. During that time, she confronts Elinor for her own behavior in the way she treated him all his life. This in turn made her despise Becky for calling her out about that and reveals that she thinks Becky isn't good enough for Luke. Refusing to back down, Becky decides to bargain with Elinor about having her wedding at the Plaza in exchange that she writes down her confession in everything that she did including abandoning Luke and take responsibility for herself. Meanwhile, Laurel, Becky's favorite customer at Barney's, is devastated about her ex-husband, Bill's, much younger girlfriend, Amy Forrester. Laurel tells Becky that she suspects Bill has been stealing some of her jewelry, including an antique emerald pendant her grandmother gave her and has been giving them to Amy in order to humiliate her. When Becky catches him in action stealing another one of Laurel's prized jewelry, she confronts both Bill and Amy for their actions. She tells them of her intentions to notify the authorities and press charges on Laurel's behalf unless they reimburse her by returning her jewelry at once. After Becky helps Laurel get all of her jewelry back, Laurel promises she will help Becky with anything she wants as a wedding gift. In the end, Becky finds a great idea - first attend the Plaza wedding and feign marriage to satisfy Elinor. Then she and Luke takes a private jet provided by Laurel's company to England and really get married at Becky's home. At the end of the novel, Becky reveals to Luke that she had cashed in their New York wedding gifts and booked two first- class around-the-world tickets for their honeymoon. She also mentions that she has also helped Michael find a woman who loves him as he is and even helped Danny's fashion career.

The building is nearly square, three bays on a side, with the front-facing bays projecting slightly. Its door and window openings have round-arch tops highlighted by light-colored trim. A line of corbeled brickwork separates the two floors, and there is more elaborate corbelling at the cornice. A carriage house with similar styling stands to the rear. The port of Barnstable was one of the busiest in Massachusetts in the 19th century. Prior to the construction of this facility, the customs collector of the U.S. Customs District of Barnstable operated from his own home. This building at first house the post office on the ground floor and the offices of the customs collector on the second floor, serving both of these roles until 1913. The upstairs offices next housed offices of the Barnstable County Extension Service. The post office moved out in 1958, and the federal government turned the building over to the town in 1960.

The 1-1/2 story full Cape style wood frame house was built in 1804, probably by Doctor James Townsend, whose descendants owned the house well into the 20th century. The most notable resident was Samuel Campbell, an English engineer who worked with Guglielmo Marconi on the transatlantic wireless facilities in Wellfleet. The house is notable as a particularly little-altered example of the style, with details typically only found in houses of wealthier owners. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Description and history The Townsend house is set on the southwest side of Paine Hollow Road, between it and Blackfish Creek, a tidal waterway on Wellfleet's west coast. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a central chimney, side gable roof, and brick foundation. It is clapboarded on two sides and shingled on the other two. Its entrance is centered on the southeaster facade, and is flanked by pilasters and topped by a transom window and cornice. The interior has a typical center- chimney configuration, with narrow staircases in front of and behind the chimney, chambers to either side, and the kitchen occupying most of the rear, with small chambers in the rear corners. The interior ceilings are higher than those typically found in period Capes, and the front stairs are wider than usual, both signs of the owner's wealth and status. A single-story flat-roofed ell, built in 1988 extends to the southwest. The interior has retained much of its original woodwork and hardware. The property includes two 19th-century outbuildings, a privy and a shed that once served as a summer kitchen. The house was built in 1804 by James Townsend, a local doctor who had just married. Townsend died in 1812, and his wife remarried and moved away, but the house remained within the family until the 20th century. In the early 20th century it was purchased by Samuel Campbell, an employee of Guglielmo Marconi who was employed at the Marconi station located in South Wellfleet.

The original district was visually centered on Sandwich Town Hall, Shawme Pond, and the reconstructed Dexter Grist Mill. When first listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, it was roughly bounded by Main, Grove, Water Sts., and Tupper Rd. from Beale Ave. to MA 6A. In 2010 the district was expanded, adding another and more than 150 contributing resources. The Town Hall Square area of Sandwich has been an important civic location since the town was established in 1637. Early in its history the dike was built which impounds Shawme Pond, and a grist mill was established there. It remained an agrarian community, due in part to the lack of a good harbor, until 1825, when glassmaking began to develop as an industry. Two important civic buildings, the town hall, and the First Church of Christ, were built in 1837 and 1847, during this period of prosperity, but many older buildings including several First Period houses from the 17th century, also survive in the area. Most of the properties in the district were built after American independence and before 1850. The expanded district also includes a number of houses from the second half of the 19th century, including several Queen Anne and Shingle style homes. There are four cemeteries in the district, including the original burying ground, whose oldest grave dates to 1663. There are four churches and two schools in the district, including the 1928 Henry T. Wing School at 35 Water Street, which is the largest building in the district.

His philanthropy earned him the nickname the King of Edge Hill, whilst his tunnel-building activity earned him posthumous nicknames, including the Mole of Edge Hill and the Mad Mole. Biography For many years it was thought that Joseph Williamson was born in Warrington, Lancashire. However, research by staff and volunteers of the Williamson Tunnels Heritage Centre has shown that he was born in the West Riding of Yorkshire and that his father was a glassmaker in a small village near Barnsley. At an early age, his family moved to Warrington. In 1780, when he was aged 11, he left his family and went to Liverpool where he was employed in the tobacco and snuff business of Richard Tate. He gained promotion within the business and also developed his own merchant's business in partnership with Joseph Leigh. In 1787 Richard Tate died and control of the business passed to his son, Thomas Moss Tate. Williamson married Thomas' sister, Elizabeth, in St Thomas' Church, Liverpool in 1802. The following year Williamson purchased the business from Thomas Moss Tate and from this, together with his other business enterprises, he amassed a considerable fortune. () In 1805 Williamson bought an area known as the Long Broom Field on Mason Street, Edge Hill, Liverpool, which was a largely undeveloped outcrop of sandstone and around this time moved into a house on Mason Street. He then began to build more houses in Mason Street which were built without any plans and which were \\"of the strangest description\\". The land behind the houses dropped sharply for about and, as it was the fashion to have large gardens and orchards behind them, he built brick arches onto which the gardens could be extended. Following this, he continued to employ his workmen, and recruited more, to perform tasks, some of which appeared to be useless, such as moving materials from one place to another and then back again. He also used the men to build a labyrinth of underground halls and brick-arched tunnels. Labour was plentiful at the time and with the ending of the Napoleonic wars in 1816, there were even more unemployed men in Liverpool. The tunnels were built at depths between and and they stretched for several miles. Williamson retired from his business in 1818 but continued to be a landlord, one of his tenants being the Unitarian philosopher, James Martineau. His wife died in 1822 and he then became increasingly eccentric, devoting almost all of his time to supervising his excavations and tunnel-building. In the 1830s he came into contact with George Stephenson who was building the extension of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway from Edge Hill to Lime Street stations and whose own excavations passed through those of Williamson. Williamson died in 1840 aged 71 at his home in Mason Street, the cause of death being \\"water on the chest\\". He was buried in the Tate family vault at St Thomas' Church and left an estate of ¬£39,000. He left no immediate descendant. The tunnelling ceased with his death. In 1911 St Thomas' Church was demolished. Many of the graves were removed but the Tate vault remained. In 1920 the site became a car park. During the Paradise Street development in 2005 the grave was discovered in an archaeological dig. The developers of the site, Grosvenor Henderson, plan to build a memorial garden to Williamson when the development is complete. Personality There is much evidence of Williamson's eccentricity in addition to his tunnel-building activity. His own house and the other houses built under his direction were unorthodox and often impractical in design.. On the day of his wedding, following the ceremony he went hunting, still dressed in his wedding clothes. On one occasion he invited guests for dinner but served them only a simple meal of porridge and hard biscuits. Many of the visitors then left. He described those who remained as his real friends and invited them to stay for a more lavish feast. Relationships with his wife were not always amicable and he said himself that they led a \\"cat and dog\\" life.Quoted in On one occasion Williamson set free all the birds in his wife's aviary, declaring that it was a pity that men did not also have wings to enable them to enjoy liberty. His manner varied from being \\"rough and uncouth\\" to \\"kind and considerate\\". His clothes were patched and untidy but his underclothes were clean and fine. He was a religious man and held a pew at St Thomas' Church.

It encompasses a predominantly residential area centered on a portion of Old Main Street and South Street between the villages of South Yarmouth and Bass River. The area's history is one of maritime-related industry from the late 18th to late 19th century, and then its growth as a tourist resort community. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Although Yarmouth was settled in the 17th century, its southern portions did not begin developing until around the time of American independence in the late 18th century, since much of the land had been set aside as an Indian reservation. A major smallpox epidemic crippled the Indian population, and the reservation lands were sold off. The area along the Bass River developed a maritime economy. By the turn of the 19th century it was one of the economic centers of Barnstable County. Although remnants of older buildings survive as parts of others, the oldest buildings in the district date to the 1790s, and the oldest major civic structure in the district is the Friends Meeting House (1809), and its adjacent burial ground. With the growth of the maritime industries, a variety of housing was built between 1800 and the 1850s, in architectural styles (Cape, Federal, and Greek Revival) popular during that time. These forms are those most commonly seen in the district. Other churches joined the Quaker meeting house: the Baptist Church in 1826 and the Methodist Church in 1852. Maritime industry began a decline in the second half of the 19th century, but the arrival of the railroads heralded the beginning of the area's conversion to a summer resort destination, and the area around Main Street and the bridge across the Bass River took shape as the main village center of South Yarmouth with the construction of a number of retail and commercial buildings. A number of buildings in later 19th century styles, including Gothic, Queen Anne, and Craftsman styles, are included in the district. In the 20th century, the development of Route 28 bypassed the section of Main Street (now Old Main Street), while other sections of Main Street which were included in expansions of Route 28 became more heavily developed with modern buildings.

The stunt cock is used in an extreme close up so as not to identify its bearer, the goal being to deceive the viewer into thinking that the stunt cock is the penis of the main actor. Thus, a stunt cock is analogous to a \\"stunt man\\", who anonymously does dangerous live-action sequences in place of the main actor. However, a stunt cock seldom performs dangerous acts on film. Though the term draws its name from this term, its practical application is more analogous to a body double. Industry role Stunt cock work is a very common \\"workhorse\\" position in the pornography industry. Work on a pornographic film can be very demanding, and it is often difficult for actors to perform on demand as needed. A common function of a stunt cock is to stand in for an actor who is unable to achieve erection or ejaculation on an actor who has a penis of a relatively similar size, so that filming can continue on schedule. In popular culture * In the 1976 film The First Nudie Musical, the character Rosie (played by Cindy Williams of Laverne & Shirley fame) announces the arrival of a \\"stunt cock\\" to complete the filming of a key porn scene. * In the 1997 Trey Parker film Orgazmo, the protagonist's director assigns him a stunt cock, as he does not want to participate in the sexual scenes due to his Mormon affiliation. * In the sixth book of The Dresden Files, Blood Rites, Harry investigates a pornographic film crew and is mistaken for a stunt cock by one of the actors. * A stunt cock is used in the TV show Californication to complete the filming of Vagina Town when the lead actor has \\"coke dick\\".

It is located in the heart of the Thames Valley, around 5.5 miles (9 km) south-west of Maidenhead and around 3 miles (5 km) east of Twyford, and within the civil parish of Waltham St Lawrence (where the 2011 Census population was included). History In medieval times the village lay to the south of a large lake that separated the parish from Ruscombe, and this survives in local names such as South Lake House and nearby Stanlake Park. Following the Norman Conquest in the 11th Century, the area was named 'sud-lac rue', which later became known as Shurlock Row. The Village Today Shurlock Row is a linear village. Originally, there were three public houses in the village: The Royal Oak, The Fox and Hounds and The White Hart. The Royal Oak at the central crossroads closed down in 2009 and is now a private dwelling named Morland House. The Fox and Hounds was located at the south-west of the village on The Straight Mile and is now a renovated house called The Withy Tree. The Fox & Hounds, now Withy Tree CottageWhen The White Hart came under threat, a group of 17 villagers bought the pub and turned it into a popular gastropub, called The Shurlock Inn. This is an uncommon success story which goes against the trend of disappearing village amenities across the country. However the pub was sold in late 2016 to Rare Breed Angus Ltd, and after significant renovations and an extension it has taken a unique and modern approach to its food and ambiance. Shurlock Row itself has lost its general store, butcher shop and post office in the last 20 years. The village church has also been converted into a residential property. To the south of the village, farmland separates the houses from the M4 motorway. The pub and a garage are found in the centre of the village, amongst the main body of houses. The northern edge of the village is marked by the village pond, which lies next to a crossroads. To the north-west of the pond is the parish cricket ground and to the immediate north-east is Great Martins, a large house and former village brewery. The Old Brewery in Shurlock Row Due to the beauty of the settlement's buildings, surrounding woodland and farmland and its close proximity to London, Shurlock Row is an attractive and desirable village. Many villagers work in the local towns of Maidenhead, Reading and Bracknell, although there are a number who commute to London regularly. Popular sports in the area include cricket, cycling and horse riding. The village and surrounding area is also well known for its polo clubs and grounds. Shurlock Row is the home of the Zacara Polo Team, winners of the 2011 Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup for the British Open Polo Championship and the 2012 the U.S. Open Polo Championship. The other village in the parish, Waltham St Lawrence, is larger and provides a number of amenities that Shurlock Row lacks, including a church and village hall, so many village events and meetings are held there.

It is a colorless oil that is soluble in organic solvents. Relative to other organotin compounds, MBTC is obscure and not widely used. Applications=Glass coating Monobutyltin trichloride has been examined as a precursor to tin dioxide coatings on glass. Such coatings, especially when doped, are low-emissivity and transparent to visible light, reflect infrared light, and provide a high conductance and a low sheet resistance. For example, MBTC is used in the manufacturing process of glass containers such as those used for beers, spirits, and juices. These glass-making processes heat raw materials (sand, soda-ash, limestone, and recycled glass) to produce molten glass. The molten glob is cut into smaller pieces of uniform size, and are then pressed in a mold. MBTC is applied on the external surface of these containers, and then, the glass is annealed and coated with polyethylene. MBTC is a commonly used organotin compound for on-line chemical vapor deposition because it readily decomposes at or close to the hot glass surface. The tin dioxide coatings formed are transparent to visible light, reflect infrared light, and are highly conductive. If these coatings are doped with fluorine from a source like trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), the coating will also have a lowered emissivity. PVC stabilizer Monobutyltin trichloride is used as a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) stabilizer. PVC is used in mass production for various objects. One such object is a PVC based container for various wines and brandies (especially those produced in Canada). Consequently, the MBTC leaches into the wine along with other organotin compounds (some of which are used as wood preservatives for the wine barrels). These compounds are toxic to the human body, and the amount of organotin compounds, especially MBTC, have been the subject of a lot of food-safety based research. Another object PVC is used in is pipe production. Since these pipes are used to carry drinking water, the MBTC is leeching into the drinking water supply. Safety Monobutyltin trichloride releases corrosive hydrogen chloride upon hydrolysis. Unlike some organotin compounds, it has relatively low toxicity.

Description and history The Teaticket School is set on the west side of Massachusetts Route 28, on a roughly triangular lot formed by the junction of that road with Sandwich Road, which forms the western boundary of the property. The southern part of the lot is the former Teaticket Green, a town common established in 1661. The school is a T-shaped masonry structure, oriented to face south, with the projecting section to the north. It is a single-story in height, with an elevated basement, side gable roof, corner quoining, and a projecting entry portico in the center of the south facade. The portico has a fully pedimented and modillioned gable with a round clock face at its center, and is supported by four round columns rising from the entry platform that is accessed by a flight of stairs. The building is crowned by a multi-stage tower that has a square base, octagonal belfry section with louvered sides, and a rounded cupola. The school was designed by Haynes & Mason of Fitchburg and built in 1927, replacing the town's last one-room school, a portable structure built adjacent to a 1912 schoolhouse elsewhere in Teaticket village. The only large school built prior to this one was the 1919 junior high school building, later the Hall School. This building served as an elementary school and a community meeting space until 1967, when it was adapted to house school administrative offices.

History The creation of the Central Department of Social Affairs (CDSA) followed a decision taken by the Chinese Communist Party's Central Secretariat on 18 February 1939. The decision assigned to the department some five major tasks, including those of overseeing CCP counter-intelligence work and intelligence. An alternative designation of the department at this early stage was the \\"Central Commission for Enemy Area Operations.\\" The first director of the CDSA was Kang Sheng. By the time the Chinese Civil War flared up again after World War II, Kang had been replaced by his senior deputy Li Kenong as acting director. Li was officially department director in August 1949, when the CDSA was dissolved and its tasks parceled out to other agencies. After the founding of the PRC, domestic counter-intelligence work was at the central level managed by the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China, while the task of collecting political and military intelligence overseas was assigned to the Intelligence Department of the Central Military Commission. In 1955, the task of political intelligence work was transferred to a newly created Communist party body, the CCP Central Investigation Department (CID) with Li Kenong as its first director. Today, China's Ministry of Public Security and Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China (which succeeded the CID in 1983) both trace their institutional origins to the CDSA. Worth noting in an institutional history context is the fact that some of the CDSA's sub-national counterparts (e.g., the Department of Social Affairs of the CCP Committee of province X) continued to exist as party bodies for quite some time after the founding of the PRC. In the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Department of Social Affairs of the regional CCP Committee (orig. Work Committee) was not abolished until 2 May 1961.

The original three brick towers fell into the sea due to erosion in 1890 and were replaced with wooden towers on brick foundations in 1892. The Sisters were decommissioned in 1911 but one of them, the Beacon, was moved back from the shoreline and attached to the keeper's house. It continued to operate but was replaced by a new steel tower, the Nauset Light, in 1923. Construction The first set of lighthouses were commissioned by Congress in 1837 and built for $10,000, to provide for a light halfway along the eastern coast of Cape Cod. Because there was one light (the Cape Cod Light) in Truro, and two lights (the Twin Lights) in Chatham, it was decided that there should be three lights to distinguish between the other lights. Built apart in a straight line along the crest of the cliffs, they were brick, tall and wide at the base, and wide at the lantern deck. Each was painted white with black lantern decks, which lent to their looking like three ladies with white dresses and black bonnets ‚Äì the birth of the name \\"Three Sisters.\\" Replacement lighthouses By 1890, however, the three lights were dangerously close to the cliff's edge. Since it was impossible at the time to move the three lights intact, three wooden lighthouses with otherwise identical markings were built in 1892 to replace the former lights, each built west of their original sites and using the lenses from the originals. The Beacon However, erosion continued, and by 1911, with the northernmost light only eight feet from the cliff, it was decided to move the lights back again. At this time only the center light was lit, with a triple flash in homage of her two decommissioned sisters, and became known as The Beacon. In 1918, with both their lanterns removed, the decommissioned north and south lights were purchased and incorporated into a summer cottage along Cable Road. The Beacon, which was now attached to the oil house, was in disrepair. After it was decommissioned, the northern of the two towers of Chatham Light was moved north to Eastham in 1923, to a site near the original lights, becoming the Nauset Light. Renovation for the National Register of Historic Places The Beacon was incorporated into a summer cottage, where it stayed until 1975, when it was purchased by the National Park Service. It was moved to a field to join its sisters, who had been bought ten years earlier, and, following their listing on the National Register of Historic Places, the three were renovated to their current state, less than west of their replacement and in their original configuration. In 1983, the National Park Service moved the Three Sisters 1,800 feet west of Nauset Light, lined up in their original configuration.

Beginning with a 6-0 quarter-final win against Mark Taimanov in Vancouver, the American is in rampant form. Unbelievably, the score is repeated against Bent Larsen in the Denver semi- final. Former World Champion Tigran Petrosian makes a fight of it in the final, held in Buenos Aires and appears to be containing Fischer for the first half of the match, but then loses four games in a row to suffer a demoralising 2¬Ω-6¬Ω defeat.CHESS magazine - Vol 37, November 1971, pp 53-62 Other Candidates' match scores are; quarter-final Robert H√ºbner 3-4 Petrosian (Seville, match resigned by H√ºbner as a protest over playing conditions); quarter-final Larsen 5¬Ω-3¬Ω Wolfgang Uhlmann (Las Palmas); quarter-final Viktor Korchnoi 5¬Ω-2¬Ω Efim Geller (Moscow); semi-final Petrosian 5¬Ω-4¬Ω Korchnoi (Moscow). Fischer therefore qualifies to play Boris Spassky in a match for the World Championship in 1972. Commencing with his final seven games at the 1970 Palma de Mallorca Interzonal and finishing with his first match game with Petrosian, Fischer's run of twenty consecutive wins is the longest in first class chess since Wilhelm Steinitz established the record of twenty-five, between 1873 and 1882. *Anatoly Karpov and Leonid Stein are joint winners of the Moscow Alekhine Memorial Tournament, with 11/17, ahead of Vasily Smyslov (10¬Ω/17), Vladimir Tukmakov and Petrosian (both 10/17).

The Goulston Street graffito was a sentence written on a wall beside a clue in the 1888 Whitechapel murders investigation. It has been transcribed as variations on the sentence \\"The Juwes are the men that will not be blamed for nothing\\". The meaning of the graffito, and its possible connection to the crimes attributed to Jack the Ripper, have been debated for over a century. Discovery The Whitechapel murders were a series of brutal attacks on women in the Whitechapel district in the East End of London that occurred between 1888 and 1891. Five of the murders are generally attributed to \\"Jack the Ripper\\", whose identity remains unknown, while the perpetrator(s) of the remaining six cannot be verified or are disputed. After the murders of Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes in the early morning hours of 30 September 1888, police searched the area near the crime scenes in an effort to locate a suspect, witnesses or evidence. At about 3:00 a.m., Constable Alfred Long of the Metropolitan Police Force discovered a dirty, bloodstained piece of an apron in the stairwell of a tenement, 108 to 119 Model dwellings, Goulston Street, Whitechapel. The cloth was later confirmed as being a part of the apron worn by Catherine Eddowes. Above it, there was writing in white chalk on either the wall or the black brick jamb of the entranceway.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 132; Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, pp. 23‚Äì24 Versions Long told an inquest that it read, \\"The Juwes are the men that will not be blamed for nothing.\\"Constable Long's inquest testimony, 11 October 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 213, 233; Marriott, pp. 148‚Äì149, 153 and Rumbelow, p. 61 Superintendent Arnold wrote a report which agrees with his account.Philip Sugden, \\"The Complete History of Jack the Ripper\\", pp.498-499 Detective Constable Daniel Halse of the City of London Police, arrived a short time later, and took down a different version: \\"The Juwes are not the men who will be blamed for nothing.\\"Detective Constable Halse's inquest testimony, 11 October 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 214‚Äì215, 234 and Marriott, pp. 150‚Äì151 A third version, \\"The Juws are not the men To be blamed for nothing\\", was recorded by City surveyor, Frederick William Foster.Quoted in Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 25 A copy according with Long's version of the message was attached to a report from Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Charles Warren to the Home Office.Letter from Charles Warren to Godfrey Lushington, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, 6 November 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 183‚Äì184 A summary report on the writing by Chief Inspector Swanson rendered it as \\"The Jewes are not the men to be blamed for nothing.\\"Philip Sugden, \\"The Complete History of Jack the Ripper\\", p.499 However, it is uncertain if Swanson ever saw the writing. Removal Since the murder of Mary Ann Nichols on 31 August 1888, rumours had been circulating that the killings were the work of a Jew dubbed \\"Leather Apron\\", which had resulted in antisemitic demonstrations. One Jew, John Pizer, who had a reputation for violence against prostitutes and was nicknamed \\"Leather Apron\\" from his trade as a bootmaker, was arrested but released after his alibis for the murders were corroborated.Begg, p. 157; Marriott, pp.59‚Äì75; Rumbelow, pp.49‚Äì50 Police Superintendent Thomas Arnold visited the scene and saw the writing. Later, in his report of 6 November to the Home Office, he claimed, that with the strong feeling against the Jews that already existed, the message might have become the means of causing a riot: Police Commissioner Charles Warren Religious tensions were already high, and there had already been many near-riots. Arnold ordered a man to be standing by with a sponge to erase the writing, while he consulted Commissioner Warren. Covering it in order to allow time for a photographer to arrive or removing a portion of it were considered, but Arnold and Warren (who personally attended the scene) considered this to be too dangerous, and Warren later stated he \\"considered it desirable to obliterate the writing at once\\".Letter from Charles Warren to Godfrey Lushington, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, 6 November 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Begg, p. 197 and Marriott, p. 159 Investigation While the Goulston Street graffito was found in Metropolitan Police territory, the apron piece was from a victim killed in the City of London, which has a separate police force. Some officers disagreed with Arnold and Warren's decision, especially those representing the City of London Police, who thought the writing constituted part of a crime scene and should at least be photographed before being erased,See, for example, City Commissioner Sir Henry Smith's memoirs, From Constable to Commissioner, p. 161, quoted in Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 27 but it was wiped from the wall at 5:30 a.m.Constable Long's inquest testimony, 11 October 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, p. 214 and Marriott, p. 154 According to the police officer supervising the Whitechapel murders investigation, the writing on the wall did not match the handwriting of the notorious \\"Dear Boss\\" letter, which claimed responsibility for the killings and used the signature \\"Jack the Ripper\\" (though it is widely thought that the letter was not written by the killer).Chief Inspector Swanson's report, 6 November 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 185‚Äì188 Contemporary police concluded that the text was a semi-literate attack on the area's Jewish population.

Bottom left: Mitre Square (where Catherine Eddowes was found); Bottom right: Berner Street (where Elizabeth Stride was found). Others (clockwise from top): Dorset Street (Mary Jane Kelly), Osborn Street (Emma Elizabeth Smith), George Yard (Martha Tabram), Castle Alley (Alice McKenzie). The police interviewed all the residents of 108‚Äì119 Goulston Street, but were unable to trace either the writer of the graffito or the murderer. According to historian Philip Sugden there are at least three permissible interpretations of this particular clue: \\"All three are feasible, not one capable of proof.\\" The first is that the writing was not the work of the murderer at all: the apron piece was dropped near the writing either incidentally or by design. The second would be to \\"take the murderer at his word\\"‚Äîa Jew incriminating himself and his people. The third interpretation was, according to Sugden, the one most favoured at the Scotland Yard and by \\"Old Jewry\\": The chalk message was a deliberate subterfuge, designed to incriminate the Jews and throw the police off the track of the real murderer.Sugden, p. 255 Walter Dew, a detective constable in Whitechapel, tended to think that the writing was irrelevant and unconnected to the murder,Dew's memoirs, I Caught Crippen, quoted in Fido, p. 51 whereas Chief Inspector Henry Moore and Sir Robert Anderson, both from Scotland Yard, thought that the graffito was the work of the murderer.Sugden, p. 254 Interpretation Author Martin Fido notes that the writing included a double negative, a common feature of Cockney speech. He suggests that the writing might be translated into standard English as \\"Jews will not take responsibility for anything\\" and that the message was written by someone who believed he or she had been wronged by one of the many Jewish merchants or tradesmen in the area.Fido, p. 52 Historian Philip Sugden has said that the spelling of \\"Jews\\" as \\"Juwes\\" could reflect a local dialect on the part of the author of the grafitto.Sugden, p.256 In the controversial book Jack the Ripper: British Intelligence Agent, the author Tom Slemen claims that \\"Juwes\\" is a Manchurian word. The book A Manchu Grammar (in which Paul Georg von M√∂llendorff introduced the romanization under which \\"juwe\\" represents the pronunciation of Manchu \\"two\\") was not known to the layman until publication in 1892. Slemen discovered that Warren presided over a lecture with Claude Reignier Conder entitled \\"The Origins of the Chinese\\" at London's Caxton Hall, in which the similarities to the Manchu and European languages were pointed out, and the word Juwe was said to be the part of the common root to the English words dual, duet, duo. Slemen uses this theory to suggest Conder as the Ripper. Conder's brother Francois Reignier is a next-door neighbour to Frederick Abberline‚Äîa prominent police figure in the investigation into the Jack the Ripper serial killer murders‚Äîin the 1891 and 1901 censuses, and evidence is emerging which suggests Abberline knew Conder well. Slemen says that he does not believe that the European languages are derived entirely from the Altaic languages (which Manchu is part of) but he proves that Sir Charles Warren did believe that Manchu had influenced the European family of languages. A contemporaneous explanation was offered by Robert D'Onston Stephenson, a journalist and writer supposedly interested in the occult and black magic. In an article (signed \\"One Who Thinks He Knows\\") in the Pall Mall Gazette of 1 December 1888, Stephenson concluded from the overall sentence construction, the double negative, the double definite article \\"the Juwes are the men\\", and the unusual misspelling that the Ripper was most probably French. Stephenson claimed that an \\"uneducated Englishman\\" or \\"ignorant Jew\\" was unlikely to misspell \\"Jew\\", whereas it was similar to the French juives. He excluded French-speaking Swiss and Belgians from his suspicions because \\"the idiosyncrasy of both those nationalities is adverse to this class of crime. On the contrary, in France, the murdering of prostitutes has long been practised, and has been considered to be almost peculiarly a French crime.\\"Pall Mall Gazette, 1 December 1888 (Casebook Press Project copy). This claim was disputed by a native French speaker in a letter to the editor of that same publication that ran on 6 December.Pall Mall Gazette, 6 December 1888 (Casebook Press Project copy). A still from Murder by Decree showing its depiction of the Goulston Street graffito. The film portrays \\"Juwes\\" as a Masonic term, and the original graffito was written in cursive script, not capitals. Author Stephen Knight suggested that \\"Juwes\\" referred not to \\"Jews,\\" but to Jubela, Jubelo and Jubelum, the three killers of Hiram Abiff, a semi- legendary figure in Freemasonry, and furthermore, that the message was written by the killer (or killers) as part of a Masonic plot.Stephen Knight (1976). Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution There is no evidence that anyone prior to Knight had ever referred to those three figures by the term \\"Juwes\\".Begg, p. 200 Knight's suggestion was used in fictional treatments of the murders, such as the film Murder by Decree, and the graphic novel From Hell by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell and the film of the same name starring Johnny Depp. In addition to the confusion over the exact wording and meaning of the phrase, and whether it was written by the murderer or not, author and former homicide detective Trevor Marriott raised another possibility: the piece of apron may not necessarily have been dropped by the murderer on his way back to the East End from Mitre Square. The victim herself might have used it as a sanitary towel, and dropped it on her way from the East End to Mitre Square.Marriott, p. 165 In Marriott's own words, it is an explanation that \\"many experts will regard as unbelievable\\".Marriott, p. 164 Inconclusive To this day, there is no consensus on whether or not the graffito is relevant to the murders. Some modern researchers believe that the apron fragment's proximity to the graffito was coincidental and it was randomly discarded rather than being placed near it. Antisemitic graffiti was commonplace in Whitechapel at the time and, they say, that such behaviors as specific placement of evidence and taking the time to write a message while evading the police are inconsistent with most existing profiles of the killer.Douglas, John; Olshaker, Mark (2001). The Cases That Haunt Us. New York: Simon and Schuster. pp. 36-7. If, as some writers contend, the apron fragment was cut away by the murderer to use to wipe his hands, he could have discarded it near the body immediately after it had served that purpose, or he could have wiped his hands on it without needing to remove it.Kendell, Colin 'Jack the Ripper - The Theories and The Facts' Amberley Publishing 2010 References=Bibliography * Begg, Paul (2003).

Narrator Barry Letts, best known for his tenure as the producer of Doctor Who, played Cherry-Garrard in the 1948 film Scott of the Antarctic. Synopsis A pre- title sequence shows Apsley Cherry-Garrard in London in 1938 struggling with his perceived culpability in Scott‚Äôs death. Cherry is incapacitated by a psychological collapse in 1946 and starts to flash back to his past. He arrives at the Natural History Museum in 1913 with eggs he collected in Antarctica. He recalls his discussion with Dr. Wilson two years prior when he had first suggested the expedition. Initially denied a place due to his poor eyesight a generous donation to the Terra Nova Expedition had changed Captain Scott‚Äôs mind and Cherry was signed on. Scott sets sail from New Zealand and sets up camp at Cape Evans where they settle in for the winter. Dr. Wilson leads Cherry and Birdie on the gruelling 67-mile trek to Cape Crozier where he had discovered an emperor penguin colony in 1902. Constructing a makeshift igloo four miles from the colony the trio collect the eggs. Dr. Wilson is badly burnt while rending penguin fat for the stove and they lose their tent in a hurricane. After recovering the tent the trio begin the journey back to the Cape Evans camp. Delivering the eggs to the museum Cherry is summarily dismissed by the curator and the eggs later prove to be too advanced to be of use. Dr. Wilson and Birdie joined Captain Scott on his trek to the South Pole a few months later and perished along with him on the return journey. Cherry sets out on a rescue mission but was forced to turn back by Scott‚Äôs standing orders not to risk the dogs. An epilogue, telling of Cherry‚Äôs mental anguish at failing to rescue his friends who were only 70 miles from One Ton Depot when he turned back, shows the perfectly preserved camp at Cape Evans and the remnants of the igloo at Cape Crozier.

Euroamerican settlement began in the 1850s with Puget Sound's logging era. The bay was named after Harvey and Solome Woodard, pioneers who arrived in 1853. In the 1920s the site was bought by the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company, which brought up to 1 million board feet of timber here annually by rail from all over Thurston and Lewis counties until it closed the site in 1984. A former logging railroad crosses Woodard Bay on a wooden trestle and a narrow peninsula. It runs out onto a pier in Henderson Inlet across the mouth of Chapman Bay.

Description and history The Benjamin Abbot House is a located southwest of downtown Andover, on the north side of Andover Street, a busy road connecting the center to Interstate 93. The house faces south, and its southeast corner is quite close to the road. The main block is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. A recessed ell extends to the west, joining the house to a barn that serves as a garage. The main block is five bays wide, with 8-over-8 sash windows in the outer bays, and a 6-over-6 sash above the center entrance. The entrance is in a projecting gabled vestibule with small windows on the sides; the door is made of vertical planking attached with iron strap hinges. The interior features exposed main beams (some thick, and many period features. The house was featured on the PBS program History Detectives in 2004.

The house was long thought to date to 1685 (which is mounted on a plaque above the door), and is named for Benjamin Abbot, a carpenter by trade and the son of an early settler of Andover. In 1692 Abbot accused Martha Carrier of witchcraft, alleging that she caused his foot to swell, and that his foot healed after her arrest. Benjamin Abbot died in 1703 and, therefore, did not live in this building. The house was owned by generations of the Abbot family until 1933. In 1950 it was offered to the local historical society, which refused to offer on the grounds they could not afford to maintain it properly.

The Gothic Revival house was built in the late 1840s for Joseph Thompson Abbot by Jacob Chickering, a leading local real estate developer and builder of the mid 19th century. The ornamental detailing is among the most elaborate of the time in the town. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Abbot House is set on the south side of Essex Street, a through street lined by a mix of commercial and residential buildings, not far from the center of Andover, Massachusetts. The house is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a steeply-pitched front gable roof and two side-facing cross gables on its main block, and another two on an addition that extends to the rear. The side- facing gables of the main block, along with its main gable, are ornamented with jigsawn bargeboard trim. The main gable has a short lancet-arched window at the attic level. The front facade is two bays wide, with a projecting polygonal bay window in the left bay and the front door in the right bay, sheltered by a portico. Both the portico and bay window are topped by scroll- sawn decorative woodwork. The land on which the house stands was purchased by Jacob Chickering, one of Andover's leading mid-19th century developers, in 1844. Chickering sold the lot, with the house on it, in 1850 to Joseph Thompson Abbot. In 1878 Chickering was contracted to construct a picket fence for the property. The house has had a number of owners, and may have been rented by the local Baptist church as a parsonage for a time. It presently houses a law office.

The house is estimated to have been built in the early 1720s, in the transitional period between First Period and Georgian styles of construction. It was originally one room deep with a central chimney, but was extended by additions to the rear in the 20th century. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description The Abbot- Stinson House is set at the northern corner of the junction of Stinson and Holt Roads in a rural section of eastern Andover. The main block of the house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side-gable roof, wooden clapboard siding, and a large central chimney. The house which faces Stinson Road, has a five-bay main facade, with the outer bays more closely spaced than that in the center. The entrance has a projecting vestibule with Federal styling. A series of 20th-century additions enlarge the original structure to the rear, and there is a detached modern garage to the right. The house is estimated to have been built c. 1720-26 for a member of the locally-prominent Abbot family. In its original form it consisted of one room on each side of the central chimney, with a narrow winding staircase between the entrance vestibule and the chimney. This staircase has retained one of its original newel posts; the railings are modern replacements. Architectural evidence of its early construction date include quirk-beaded main beams and gunstock- shaped posts at the corners on the second floor. The chamber on the west side was likely the kitchen, with a large fireplace that has since been closed off. This space was later subdivided to form a closet, bathroom, and hallway leading to the modern addition to the rear. Both the parlor (to the east of the chimney) and the parlor chamber above it feature high-quality wood paneling, and the framing members (exposed in the kitchen chamber) are boxed. The house, representing a well-preserved example of an early transitional First Period-Georgian house, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

Description and history The Abbot-Baker House is located southwest of downtown Andover, on the north side of Argilla Road, just west of its junction with Andover Street, a major northeast-southwest artery in the town. The house is a 2-1/2 story colonial saltbox style construction with a large central chimney. It is five window bays wide, with a central entrance in a projecting gable-roofed vestibule.

Description and history The Abbot-Battles House is located north of downtown Andover, on the north side of Lowell Street (Massachusetts Route 133), a busy east-west through street. It is a two-story wood-frame structure, with a low-pitch hip roof and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance sheltered by a Victorian-era porch. Ionic columns rise to an entablature adorned with triglyphs, and the porch roof is bounded by a balustrade with urns on the posts. The house was built about 1809 for Jeduthan Abbot, a farmer who had married in 1805 and by then had two children. The house was built in part around the core of an older house, built c. 1700, which the previous owner of the property had removed part of. The Federalist facade of the house dates to Abbot's ownership. In 1838 Abbot sold the property to his son, from whom it quickly passed to Winslow Battles, who is identified by trade as a machinist. The house remained in the Battles family until 1950. The house's ownership history is indicative of the town's transition from an agrarian to an industrial economy.

It encompasses the historic campuses of three important 18th and 19th century academic institutions, which shaped not only town but the nation's educational systems. The first school established in Andover was the Phillips Academy, established in 1778. Its campus includes a number of notable buildings, from two important building phases. The first, between about 1810 and 1830, resulted in the construction of Bulfinch Hall (1819, named for, but not designed by, Charles Bulfinch), Samaritan Hall (1824, at first an infirmary, but later used for other purposes), and the Stowe House (1828, remodeled by Harriet Beecher Stowe in the 1850s, and later used as an inn). The second building phase was in the early decades of the 20th century, when Bell Tower, Morse Hall, and Addison Gallery were built. The campus of the Andover Theological Seminary (founded 1807) includes the oldest building in the district, Foxcroft Hall, which was built in 1808. Along with Pearson Hall (1818) and Bartlet Hall (1820), it is a fine example of Federalist academic architecture. The latter two buildings underwent some changes, most notably being reduced from four to three stories to better fit the scale of the campus, in the 20th century. The campus also includes the 1809 Phelps House, which housed the first president of the academy, and later Professor Austin Phelps. The third school in the district is the Abbot Academy, which was founded in 1828 as a women's school. It merged with the Phillips Academy in 1973, but its former central campus retains definition, with three buildings surrounding the \\"Abbot Circle\\": Abbot Hall, the original academy building (1829), Draper Hall, a dormitory (1890), and McKeen Hall. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

Hemotympanum is often the result of basilar skull fracture.. It may also be secondary to fractures of the mandibular condyles. Blueprints Neurology, 2nd ed Hemotympanum refers to the presence of blood in the middle ear, which is the area behind the eardrum. In most cases, the blood is trapped behind the eardrum, so no discharge is visible. Treating hemotympanum depends on the underlying cause. __TOC__ Presentation The most common symptoms of hemotympanum are: * pain * sense of fullness in the ear * hearing loss Causes= Skull fracture  A Basal skull fracture is a fracture in one of the bones at the base of the skull. This is almost always caused by impact trauma, a hard fall, or a car crash. If the temporal bone is affected,one of the following may co-occur: * Auricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) discharge * Dizziness * Bruises around the eyes or behind the ears * \\"Facial weakness\\" * Difficulty seeing, smelling, or hearing  Nasal packing  Following nasal surgery or frequent nosebleeds, gauze or cotton may be inserted into the nose to stop the bleeding. This process is called therapeutic nasal packing. Nasal packing sometimes causes blood to back up into the middle ear, causing hemotympanum. Removing the packing may allow the blood to drain from the ear. Antibiotics can prevent an ear infection.  Bleeding disorders  Bleeding disorders, such as hemophilia or idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, can also cause hemotympanum. These disorders prevent proper blood clotting. In that circumstance, a mild head injury or a strong sneeze can cause hemotympanum.  Anticoagulant medications  Anticoagulants, often called blood thinners, are medications that keep blood from clotting too easily. In rare cases, anticoagulants can cause hemotympanum with no underlying cause or injury. Experiencing a head injury while taking anticoagulants, increases the likelihood of hemotympanum.  Ear infections  Frequent ear infections, ongoing inflammation and fluid buildup can increase the risk of hemotympanum.  Treatment  Skull fractures usually heal on their own, but they can also cause several complications. Cerebrospinal fluid leaking out of the ear involves a higher risk of developing meningitis. Treatment may include corticosteroids, antibiotics, or surgery.

Description and history The Abraham Adams House stands in a residential subdivision in the Byfield area of Newbury. It is set on the north side of Pearson Drive, on a parcel. It is a story wood frame house, whose main block, its oldest portion, has a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Later additions include a two-story ell projecting from the rear of the house, to which is connected a single story modern addition, giving the whole house an \\"I\\" shape. The main part of the house was probably built between 1705 and 1707, based on an analysis of the construction methods used. It was built by Abraham Adams, a farmer and sea captain who was married to the granddaughter of jurist Samuel Sewall. Three of the four chambers in the oldest portion have exposed oak timbers with chamfered corners, while the fourth chamber and the first ell have Second Period fireplace surrounds. The house was surrounded by hayfields until the construction of the surrounding subdivision in the 1980s; as a consequence, it was known for many years as \\"High Fields\\".

Built about 1725, it retains a number of features transitional between the First and Second periods of colonial architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The Adams‚ÄìClarke House is located northwest of Georgetown center, on the north side of West Main Street (Massachusetts Route 97) between Pentucket and Weston Avenues. It is oriented facing nearly directly south, placing it at an unusual angle to the street, which runs roughly northwest. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a Federal-style central entrance flanked by pilasters and topped by a four-light transom and corniced entablature. Windows are 9-over-6 sash, with simple framing. An ell extends to the east side of the building. On the interior, the right side parlor has exposed unchamfered beams, while the left parlor has a Second Period fireplace mantel. The lobby, set between the chimney and the door, includes a winding staircase with feathered sheathing similar to that seen in the right parlor. The addition's interior is Federal in style. The house was probably built by Isaac Davis sometime after he bought the land in 1716. Its oldest section is the chimney and right side rooms, with the left side rooms added not long afterward. The house exterior was refashioned in Federal style c. 1800, about the time the right-side addition was built. A later 18th-century resident was Benjamin Adams, a militia officer who served in the American Revolutionary War, and represented Rowley in the state legislature.

Its large building is an anchor of the western end of Salem's business district, of which Essex Street is a major component, and is one of the finest Classical Revival buildings in Salem. The Salem YMCA was first organized in 1858, and it commissioned the construction of this building in 1898. The three story brick and limestone building was designed by Walter J. Paine, and has retained most of its exterior styling. The ground floor was designed to house primarily retail establishments, with the YMCA entrance highlighted by an ornate entablature supported by twin columns on either side. Entrances to the retail establishments are also indicated by building bays that project out less prominently than the main entrance. The ground floor is built in limestone, while the upper floors are predominantly brick. The building originally had a loggia on top of the roof, but that was removed in the 1950s. Faced with declining enrollments through the 1970s, the YMCA sold part of the second and third floors to the Salem Housing Authority, which converted that area to senior housing.

It is the fourth book in the Shopaholic series. It follows the story of Becky Brandon (n√©e Bloomwood) and her husband Luke as they return from their ten-month long honeymoon. Plot synopsis The novel commences with the protagonist, Becky Bloomwood, coming to the conclusion of her extravagant ten-month-long honeymoon around the World with her husband, Luke. Although the newlyweds have been enjoying themselves, Luke and Becky decide it is time to return home to England. Before returning home, the couple embarks upon a brief trip to Milan, where Luke is scheduled to meet with a potential client. After agreeing with Luke that she will not buy anything in Milan, Becky explores the city. She heads to a leather store and manages to buy Luke a new leather belt as a present to him, wanting to replace the one she ruined with the hot wax when she was waxing her legs. Becky's resolve not to purchase anything for herself is weakened when she sees the opportunity to own an Angel handbag, a popular and expensive purchase. Unfortunately, the clerk tells her that there is a waiting list for the bag. A wealthy businessman, Nathan Temple, overhears the encounter between Becky and the sales assistant. He persuades the sales assistant to sell the handbag to Becky because he and the owner are friends. Becky shows her gratitude by promising to pay him back somehow. When Becky gives Luke the new belt, he is pleased and believes that she has made a sincere commitment to changing her shopping irresponsible habits. Back in England, Becky and Luke stop to visit the Bloomwood family and surprise them with their early return. Becky is shocked and dismayed when her parents appear to be hiding something. Not only that, but they are not impressed with Becky's gifts and don't seem as excited as Becky had hoped. The next day, Luke and Becky attend the christening of Suze's twins. Unfortunately, Suze has befriended a local woman, Lulu, who is a mother of four children and hopes that she and Becky will like each other. From their first meeting and much to Suze's dismay, Becky and Lulu quickly dislike each other to the point they become enemies. Lulu expresses her belief that she thinks Becky is immature and shallow for her age. Offended, Becky tells Lulu off that she thinks that she is a horse-faced, hypocritical and judgmental person with no interest in getting to know others. Later on, Suze expresses her concerns with Becky about how she and Lulu treated each other. In turn, Becky admits to Suze that she doesn't like Lulu and the feelings between them are mutual. She also mentions she feels isolated from Suze since she and Lulu have more in common as they have children of their own. In turn, Suze admits her jealousy towards Becky for going on a fabulous 10 month honeymoon around the world, while she was at home with three children. She mentions that Lulu was there to help her cope, but Becky keeps her stance about Lulu and this leads to a fight. She and Suze suffers a falling out between them. After leaving the Cleath-Stuart home, Luke comforts Becky and tells her that no one was expecting them back for another month. Becky's troubles become worse when two trucks full of her souvenirs she has accumulated from her trip arrive. The bills for them are outrageous and with her new job not due to start for several months, Luke orders Becky to sort things out around the house with her spare time. Luke immediately switches back into business-mode, cutting his hair, becoming more efficient and donning expensive suits. Thinking quickly at her neighbors' suggestion, Becky sells most of her souvenirs off to eBay and makes good money off it to pay Luke back, including the 20 Tiffany clocks (which she accidentally sells off unaware that he bought them as a gift to Arcodas' Group). Luke finds out about the missing clocks from his co-worker who bought it off eBay and is angry with Becky for a while. Becky's parents arrive with big news. They explain that they did not want to tell Becky initially until she settled down, but she has a half-sister from a previous relationship of her father's, a woman named Marguerite - and whose name is Jessica Bertram, nicknamed \\"Jess\\". Becky is ecstatic - she claims that she has felt a hole in her life and has always wanted a sister. She imagines going shopping together, enjoying girls' nights in, and having a new best friend to replace Suze. However, when Becky meets Jess for the first time, she is disappointed right away. It turns out that Jess is studious, thrifty, and a bit standoffish. Jess tries to encourage Becky to save money, but Becky can't comprehend why Jess does not want to do anything fun. When Becky overhears Luke saying that she is hard to live with, she is shocked and thinks that her marriage is falling apart. Jess and Becky suffer a falling-out when they realize they have nothing in common. She also suffers one with Luke when he discovers that she had arranged a meeting for him to see Nathan Temple, whom he's not happy about seeing, and the fact Becky had gotten an Angel handbag. Both spend a few days arguing as he reveals that he thinks Jess is more helpful than she is because he's been trying to win over Arcodas. In anger and tears, Becky tells Luke off that she had a lot of her own problems to deal with the last few months and he never has time for her. He shows a hint of compassion for her, but also tells Becky that he needs time away from her. Luke hopes that in being away from her, Becky will have time to reassess her attitude. After he leaves, she reads down the paper which is a list of complaints Luke has with her and comes to the conclusion that their marriage has fallen apart. No sooner that Luke leaves for Cyprus, Becky has a hard time adjusting to life in the loft alone and tries to call Suze. It doesn't work as she has an outing planned for her and Lulu's children. Becky then attempts to call her parents for comfort, only to remember they are going on a wellness cruise that will take them out of the country for a month. Becky decides to go to a supermarket to distract her from her thoughts. It fails to do the trick and she goes home to try to get some sleep. Becky soon has a nightmare about transforming into her nemesis, Alicia, donning a fancy suit and a selfish sneer. In her nightmare after hurting Jess, Luke and Suze both reprimand her for her behavior. After that, Becky decides to go to Jess' home in Northern England to learn to be thrifty and make amends with her. Jess wants nothing to do with Becky and wants her to return to London. Her neighbor and shopkeeper, Jim shows compassion and lets Becky stay at his friend's Bed and Breakfast. The next day, she learns about Jess' past from Jim and Becky starts realizing that she had been a spoiled brat all her life. She becomes close friends to his 17-year-old daughter, Kelly, who likes how fashion forward Becky is. When Jess refuses to talk to Becky again, she nearly takes Kelly's advice until Jim convinces her to attend an environmental meeting with them. During an environmental meeting, Jess finally talks to Becky alone and confesses that she recently did a test for a blood clot. She remembers being told to get tested for blood clots if they were related, but pushed it away in the back of her mind. Becky continues listening as Jess mentioned that she learned more about her mother's flirtatious past from her aunt, Florence, before marrying Bill. Becky realizes she was trying to get a DNA test done for her and Graham. Jess mentioned if he wasn't her father, she could move on and continue finding more potential fathers. Letting the truth sink in that there was no DNA test done and that everyone assumed, Becky concludes that she and Jess may not be related and is heartbroken by this. Realizing the extent in how much she's hurt Jess during her visit in London and how immature she truly is in her behavior, Becky makes a heartfelt apology to her. She admits that though they may not be sisters, Becky mentions she was right in the end. She kept ignoring Jess' advice to save money and use her tips to be thrifty by continuing to spend on unnecessary items that she doesn't need. In the end, Becky's behavior cost her everything including losing her friends and her marriage to Luke finally fell apart. Jess forgives Becky and wishes her luck in saving her marriage. Becky returns to her room and begins packing for the return trip home to face Luke. She realizes that in order for her to try to fix their marital problems, she must start accepting responsibility for herself and apologize for her behavior. Robin and a few others from the environmental meeting tries to get her to stay regardless, especially Jim who is concerned for Becky's well being. Becky appreciates their generosity, but still insists that she return home to fix her marriage. She says her farewell to Jim and Kelly begs her to stay. Becky remains adamant that she must return home to save her marriage and promises Kelly a shopping trip in London. She asks Jim to do her one last favor in delivering a necklace she bought originally for Jess. He convinces her to come with him to Jess' house to do a delivery so she can drop it off herself before returning to London. Still harboring resentment against Jess for ignoring her during her visit to London, Becky believes her to boring and passionless much to Jim's amusement. He decides to show her something to prove Becky wrong about Jess. Jim takes Becky to Jess' house and shows her true passion in a cupboard similar to her shoe collection. However, it is filled with rocks ranging from normal rocks to rare crystals that shine beautifully. In that moment, Becky's resentment disappears and she realizes Jess has something in common with her. Jim explains the whole story about Jess' injury and how she was almost arrested in trying to smuggle a rare rock from another country, but was let off with a warning. As he continued telling the story, Becky quickly feels guilty for insulting Jess' passion in rock collecting by calling it boring and a waste of time. Becky also comes to the realization that going shopping for unnecessary items can be boring, but she had never been able admit it. Jess has departed on a mountain climb on a gloomy day, and Becky follows to try to catch up and apologize again. Unfortunately, Becky is not only wearing the incorrect footwear, but is also inappropriately dressed to embark upon a hike of that magnitude. She ends up not following the trail and has a nasty fall in dreadful weather. Luckily, Jess has the mental and moral fortitude to watch over her. The two girls reconcile and discover that though their interests are drastically different, they share the same level of passion for their hobbies. Becky admits Jess was originally right about her from the start and that she has been spoiled by her parents all her life. She learns more on Jess' past in her stepfather Bill's harsh upbringing that made her grow up into the woman she is. While she learned to fend for herself and value money at a young age, Becky's parents always paid for everything and thus she never learned how to do either. It resulted in her having to rely on others to help get her out of debt and which continued until Jess finally told Becky it's time to grow up and start being responsible for her actions. She apologizes again for her earlier behavior and insulting her passion for rock collecting after seeing how beautiful it is. Seeing how truly sorry Becky is, Jess forgives her and accepts her as her sister. She finally admits that Becky is only half to blame for her marriage falling apart. She is shocked because she thought it was her own fault that her selfish behavior and irresponsible shopping habits caused the whole mess. Jess admits she had also seen Luke's earlier behavior while she was in London. Worried over their marriage falling apart, she tried to speak up on Becky's behalf because she is also concerned about his coldness over not wanting his wife to help him out with impressing the Arcodas Group as his company's potential client. When Luke didn't listen, Jess saw first hand how neglectful he was in his duties as a husband to Becky and not making time to help her with her own problems when she needed him. She has also witnessed how much he was willing to sacrifice their marriage just to keep working and winning over the new client. To Jess, it was also selfish on his part and warned him not to let the strain in their marriage get worse. Becky is finally able to give Jess the silver bean Tiffany necklace that she bought for her as a gift. Jess loves the necklace and Becky finally saw her real weakness - aside from collecting rocks. Tarquin and Suze arrive with the RAF to rescue Becky and Jess. The book concludes with Becky finally relishing the pleasures of being thrifty and has finally reconciled with Luke. She and Suze are helping Jess organize a protest against a new shopping mall (which turns out to be one of Luke's new clients). Eventually someone finds Becky's Angel handbag and it is returned to her. She is hesitant to accept it and Suze asks her why, revealing it's a fabulous bag. Becky disagrees and she explains that the bag was the source of all the troubles it caused her when Suze, Jess and Luke turned away from her. Being in Northern England the last couple of days made her realize that she needs to be more responsible for her actions and grow up. Becky decides working on her marriage with Luke, reconciling with Suze and building a relationship with Jess are more important than having the seasons hottest trends. She gives the purse and her make up collection to Kelly. Becky later discovers that she is not only pregnant, but also the public had been misinformed by Robin when Luke explains that the Arcodas Group had no intentions of building a shopping mall in a wildlife area that is protected, and instead has been planning to restore an old building not to far from it for future generations to learn about wildlife conservation.  Characters Introduced in the Book  Nathan Temple: An English businessman who owns Value Motels who helps Becky jump to the head of the waiting list to get an Angel handbag since he and the owner are friends. She pays him back by arranging a meeting with him and Luke in Cyprus. This made Luke very livid with Becky about it, as Temple has been convicted of a crime in the past, but had to attend because Temple will buy out Daily World and he can't afford to insult him. He ends up liking Temple when he learns about his past and how he got that conviction against him in the first place: because he was defending his staff from an abusive drunken guest and things got out of hand. Jessica 'Jess' Bertram: Becky's older half-sister that her father had with Jess' mother, Marguerite, from a past relationship. She was excited because she always wanted a sister and always dreamed about both of them going shopping together, helping her cope with Suze not being her friend and enjoying girls' night in. She was disappointed when she learns that Jess is thrifty, studious and a bit standoffish. Her passion is collecting rocks, which was the one of the issues between her and Becky that lead to a falling- out. Jess tells her that she's a spoiled brat who lived in a fantasy world. In turn, Becky tells her that she thinks she's boring, miserable, thrifty and has no passions in her life. It was those very words she later regretted telling Jess after Jim showed her, the rock collection in a glass cupboard similar to her own shoe collection cupboard. While stuck in a mountain during the storm, Jess reveals that she never intended to be rude to Becky, but was unnerved by her because of her parents' harsh upbringing. They reconcile and Becky learns to enjoy being thrifty. She gives Jess the silver Tiffany bean necklace, which she loves and showed Becky, her rock collection. In Mini Shopaholic, it is revealed that Jess and Tom got married in Chile. They are planning to adopt, though Janice is insistent they have a biological child first and of which Becky calls her out for. Lulu Hetherington: Suze's new best friend and a mother of four. She and Becky have an immediate dislike towards each other. After Lulu insults her for being immature for her age, Becky calls her out for it and insults her back that she thinks of Lulu as a judgmental and horse- faced hypocrite with no intentions of knowing others. Insulted, Lulu and Becky become enemies because of it. She feels isolated when she sees that Suze and Lulu have more in common. Their relationship still hasn't changed a bit with Lulu and Becky still have the occasional insult run-ins. Soon Suze starts to see Lulu for the hypocrite she really is, thanks to some embarrassing photos that Becky had procured from a private investigator and along with the fact that Lulu had been having an affair outside her marriage with Iain Walker, the CEO of the Arcodas Group. It's unknown what happened to her, but it's presumed that Suze ended her friendship with Lulu after realizing how right Becky was not to trust her. Jim Smith: The owner of Scully Stores who is a friend of Jess' family. He showed Becky all of Jess' rock collection and she immediately regretted what she said about them. Jim also tells her about how harsh Bill was in her upbringing with her brothers and the way they valued money because of it. After learning from him that Jess paid her way through school, Becky comes to the realization that her parents didn't teach her how to value money at a young age and thus she wounded up needing others to pay her debts. Kelly Smith: Jim's teenaged daughter, who immediately takes a liking to Becky as she's fashion forward. She becomes a supporting friend to her, during her short and brief time in Scully. Becky gives her an entire collection of Stila cosmetics and promises her a shopping trip at Topshop. Robin: The kind-hearted and firm leader of the environmental protest group who Becky befriends. Robin listens to her suggestions for more media attention and a public rally. He and the other protesters likes the idea of it, but Jess is against it for a reason.

He tells her that the environmental meeting is no place to take out personal family issues. Robin also tells Jess that Becky has good ideas that he finds helpful and refreshing over her own monotone, tactical opinions. He's later revealed to have misinformed the public about the Arcodas Group's intentions to build a shopping mall in a wildlife protected area when Luke showed up to confront them.

It is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of and an eccentricity of 0.24. The visible component is an aging giant star with a stellar classification of G9 III, having exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and expanded to 10.7 times the Sun's radius. It is a red clump giant, indicating it is on the horizontal branch and is generating energy via core helium fusion. The star is 3.2 billion years old with 1.54 times the mass of the Sun. It is radiating 53 times the Sun's luminosity from its enlarged photosphere at an effective temperature of 4,666 K. The star has a very low rate of spin, with the projected rotational velocity being too small to measure.

The idea is based on the normal idea of entitlement. Entitlements can in the main be determined by agreeing on a cooperative game and using its value as the entitlement. Even when only money is to be divided and some fixed amount has been specified for each recipient, the problem can be complex. The amounts specified may be more or less than the amount of money and the profit or loss will then need to be shared out. A proportional adjustment is normally used in law nowadays and is the default assumption in the theory of fair division. Other rules however are often used and this article describes the basis underlying the common variants. Shared costs or gains Where a number of persons cooperate to pay for a facility or to gain from an enterprise there is the question of how costs or gains should be divided. In general deciding such entitlements is a cooperative game as the various parties can form coalitions against others, for instance as in a union versus a company. The Shapley value is one common method of deciding bargaining power as can be seen in the airport problem. In economics an allocation which cannot be improved upon by any coalition is said to have the core property. Welfare economics on the other hand tries to determine allocations depending on fairness criteria. The people can also agree on their relative entitlements by a consensus process. For instance they could say what they think everyone else is entitled to and if the assessments agree then they have an agreed impartial consensus division. Voting Voting can be a very nonlinear process. The allocation of seats by size of population can leave small constituencies with no voice at all. The easiest solution is to have constituencies of equal size. Sometimes, however, this can prove impossible ‚Äì for instance, in the European Union or United States. Ensuring the 'voting power' is proportional to the size of constituencies is a problem of entitlement. There are a number of methods which compute a voting power for different sized or weighted constituencies. The main ones are the Shapley‚ÄìShubik power index, the Banzhaf power index. These power indexes assume the constituencies can join up in any random way and approximate to the square root of the weighting as given by the Penrose method. This assumption does not correspond to actual practice and it is arguable that larger constituencies are unfairly treated by them. In the Talmud The Talmud has a number of examples where entitlements are not decided on a proportional basis. * The disputed garment problem. If one person claims the whole of a cloth and another half then it is divided 3/4 and 1/4.Bava Metzia 2a. The disputed garment * The estate division problem. Three wives have claims to 100, 200 and 300 zuz. Three cases are considered, if the estate is 100 zuz then they get 33 and a third each, if 200 then 50, 75, 75, and if 300 then 50, 100 and 150.Ketubot 93a. The estate division problem * Profits from a joint fund. If two people put 200 and 100 into a fund and buy an ox for ploughing and use it for that purpose they divide the profit evenly between them. But if they instead then slaughter the ox they divide the profit in proportion. This is discussed in the Babylonian Talmud just after the estate division problem. * Ibn Ezra's problem. This is a later problem of estate division that was solved in a different way. A man with an estate of 120 dies bequeathing 120, 60, 40 and 30 to his four sons. The recommendation was to award (120-60)/1+(60-40)/2+(40-30)/3+(30-0)/4 to the first and sums with leading terms removed for the rest ending with 30/4 for the last. This allocation is different from the previous estate division These solutions can all be modeled by cooperative games. The estate division problem has a large literature and was first given a theoretical basis in game theory by Robert J. Aumann and Michael Maschler in 1985.Game Theoretic Analysis of a bankruptcy Problem from the Talmud Robert J. Aumann and Michael Maschler.

The resulting LAPD investigation of Kevin Gaines helped lead to the Rampart Scandal. Early career In 1986, Lyga joined the Los Angeles Police Department after serving with the Mohawk Valley sheriff‚Äôs force. The Kevin Gaines shooting Kevin Gaines was shot and killed on March 18, 1997, by Lyga, who was ultimately determined to have been acting in self- defense. At the time of his death, Gaines was 31 and had been a member of the Los Angeles Police Department for seven years. Gaines had ties to Death Row Records, the Bloods, and was living with Suge Knight's ex-wife. Lyga and other members of his team were staking out a suspected methamphetamine dealer, and Lyga was the point man, which required him to sit in an unmarked 1991 Buick Regal waiting for a drug deal to happen, so that he could follow the suspects back to their source and make the necessary arrests. The operation was called off, and Lyga drove onto Ventura Boulevard. While he was stopped at a red light, a green sports utility vehicle driven by Gaines pulled up next to him; Gaines threatened Lyga. In response Lyga told Gaines to pull over for a confrontation. Gaines did pull over, but Lyga drove off; Gaines chased him, with the S.U.V. edging through heavy traffic until it neared Lyga's car. A concerned Lyga radioed his partners for help and readied himself to use his own gun. He saw Gaines had a gun and had threatened Lyga again. Lyga fired two shots at Gaines; the first missed, but the second hit the driver just below his right armpit, puncturing his heart before stopping in his lung. Gaines then pulled into a gas station and stopped. Lyga pulled into the gas station and identified himself as a police officer and asked a customer coming out of the station's mini-mart to call the 911 emergency number. Soon a California Highway Patrol unit arrived, followed by Lyga's captain and the others on his stakeout team. The other officers took control of the scene using standard procedure. When Lyga returned to the station and awaited instructions on the investigation of the shooting he was informed by his commander, Dennis Zuener, that Kevin Gaines was a Los Angeles Police Officer. Aftermath of the shooting The day after the shooting a media frenzy followed. A group of African-Americans, led by Gaines's former partners Derwin Henderson and Bruce Stallworth, went to the scene of the incident and began conducting an unofficial investigation. That conduct intimidated known witnesses. Three days after the shooting, Johnnie Cochran, Jr. stepped into the case, having been hired by Gaines's family to investigate a potential claim against Lyga and the city. Cochran later filed a twenty-five-million-dollar claim against the city, charging that Lyga was \\"an aggressive and dangerous police officer\\" who had failed to summon immediate medical assistance for Gaines, contributing to his death, and that he had conspired to \\"hide and distort the true facts concerning the incident\\". The Los Angeles Police Department also announced Lyga‚Äôs job performance would be examined. On Lyga's second day back on his job, he was assigned to a desk by the narcotics-division commander, and was told that he had 40 questionable use-of-force incidents filed, however he had been exonerated in four cases of using unnecessary force, or the cases were classified as unfounded or unresolved. He was also tested for signs of racial bias for every use-of-force incident by a demographic examination; no signs of racial bias by Lyga were found. District Attorney Gil Garcetti opened a criminal investigation into the shooting. Witnesses to various moments of the event confirmed Lyga's account, as did a surveillance camera at the mini-mart, which recorded the sound of Lyga firing two shots 1.8 seconds apart. The District Attorney's inquiry eventually ruled that Lyga was not criminally liable. Three months after the incident, the LAPD unit investigating the shooting found that Lyga had acted according to department policy, and the department's shooting board recommended no disciplinary action. The ruling, however, was postponed pending results of a three-dimensional digital re- creation of the shooting. In November, 1997, Lyga appeared again before the shooting board, which reviewed the evidence and the 3D re-creation, and in December LAPD chief Bernard Parks reported that the shooting was within department policy; no action would be taken against Lyga. Even though the re- creation of the shooting supported Lyga‚Äôs story, the city and Cochran agreed to a settlement conference the following October, mediated by retired Judge R. William Schoettler, Cochran had reduced his claim for 25 million dollars to $800,000 and then to $250,000, which the city agreed to. Judge Schoettler later wrote a letter to Parks telling him that he thought the settlement was \\"political\\"; had the case gone to trial, he believed, Lyga and the city would have won. Stolen evidence Within months of being cleared, Lyga found himself under investigation again. On March 27, 1998, one pound of cocaine evidence booked from one of Lyga's previous arrests was found missing from the Parker Center property room. Rafael Perez Investigators eventually learned that the missing cocaine had been stolen by Rafael Perez, whom they suspected, at the time, of targeting Lyga in retaliation for the shooting of Gaines. The arrest of Perez, along with Gaines's death would cause investigations that would lead to the Rampart Scandal. Suspension and termination On June 26, 2014, Detective Frank Lyga was placed on paid administrative leave after a pending investigation into allegations he made racist comments calling Attorney Carl Douglas an \\"Ewok from the Star Wars movies\\". The comment was made after a training lecture given to other officers, during a question-answer section with officers asking for information relating to the 1997 shooting and aftermath. Lyga was recorded on November 15, 2013, after an in-service training class at the Los Angeles Police Academy. Detective Lyga told the class that he didn't have any regrets shooting Gaines; in fact, he wished there were more of \\"them\\" in the car at the time. He stated that he could have killed a truckload of \\"them\\" and not felt anything and would be happy doing it. In the recording, he called a female captain a \\"very cute little Hispanic lady who couldn't find her ass with both of her hands\\". In 1998, the woman had been a detective assigned to investigate the disappearance of Lyga's personnel file. He also said of the woman, \\"I heard she's been swapped around a bunch of times.\\" He also called a lieutenant a \\"fucking moron\\" and another officer a \\"fruit\\". In October 2014, the LAPD Board of Rights recommended that Lyga be terminated. He retired prior to being fired by LAPD Chief Charles Beck. In August 2016, the City of Los Angeles agreed to pay Lyga $50,000 for wrongful termination. However, the city admitted no wrong doing and Lyga was not offered his job back as a part of the settlement.City to pay $50,000 to ex-LAPD detective who sued after being fired for racially charged remarks - Los Angeles Times, KATE MATHER, August 5, 2016 References Category:1950s births Category:Living people Category:Los Angeles Police Department officers Category:Rampart scandal Category:People from Herkimer County, New York ","title":"Frank Lyga"},{"id":"18703572","text":"Bellevue Cemetery is a historic cemetery in Lawrence and Methuen, Massachusetts. Established in 1847 and owned by the city of Lawrence, it is the first and principal cemetery of the city and a notable example of a rural cemetery. In conjunction with adjacent cemeteries and Lawrence's High Service Water Tower and Reservoir, it provides part of the small city's largest area of open space. The cemetery was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Description and history Bellevue Cemetery is located in northwestern Lawrence, with a small strip of land in southern Methuen. It is bounded on the east by May Street, and on the north by Barker Street and St. Mary's Cemetery. To the west and south are residential areas, with the park containing the High Service Water Tower and Reservoir also to the south. The cemetery is just over in size, and is roughly U-shaped, with St. Mary's Cemetery and the center of the U. The oldest portion of the cemetery is a section between May Street and Reservoir Street, and was established in 1847. The area west of Reservoir Street and south of Barker was acquired in 1893. The \\"Old Yard\\" was laid out in the park-like landscape setting of winding lanes amid terraced hillsides in the then-popular rural cemetery style, while \\"New Bellevue\\" has a slightly less formal feel. Major buildings and structures in the cemetery include the c. 1922 main gates, built of brick and iron, and the \\"Hearse House\\" in the Old Yard, which now houses the cemetery offices. Near the Hearse House is the now-unused Cremation Tomb, built into a hillside with a plain granite facade and bronze cremation urns above the door. In the New Bellevue section, the 1893 Brick Stable is an imposing Classical Revival structure with Queen Anne details, which anchors the cemetery's main maintenance yard. Other buildings in the yard are a garage, gasoline house, and tool house, all built before 1940. Noted burials It is the final resting place of many victims of the Pemberton Mill disaster of January 10, 1860. It is also the burial place of comedic movie actress Thelma Todd, whose performance in title role in Laurel and Hardy's movie The Bohemian Girl was truncated due to her death, believed by some to have been a murder.

Plot The film follows the comings and goings at the H√¥tel du Nord on the banks of the Canal St. Martin in Paris. The films begins with the gathering of many of the hotel's occupants around the dinner table for the first communion of Mich√®le, who lives in the hotel with her policeman father, Maltaverne. Madame Lecouvreur tells Mich√®le to bring a piece of cake upstairs to Raymonde (Arletty), who is talking with her boyfriend, Edmond (Louis Jouvet). A prostitute, Raymonde leaves Edmond, a photographer, who wants to develop his film. In the meantime, a young couple, Ren√©e (Annabella) and Pierre (Jean-Pierre Aumont), enter the hotel and rent a room for the night. Once alone, Ren√©e and Pierre discuss their plan to kill themselves as they feel they have nothing left to live for. Pierre takes a small pistol, to shoot Ren√©e first. Edmond hears a shot from his own nearby room. But Pierre has lost his resolve, and is unable to shoot himself. Edmond breaks into the room, and finding Pierre standing over Ren√©e's body, motions him to flee through the open window. Edmond lies to the police saying he had found the girl lying dead, alone in the room. Having stopped to share a drink with the communion celebrants downstairs, Raymonde is still in the hotel when the police arrive. An officer investigating the crime finding her papers not in order, hauls her away, to jail for four days. Later in the week, Ren√©e, who was only wounded, wakes up in the hospital and finds out that Pierre has surrendered to the police, confessing what he believes his guilt‚Äîthe murder of his girlfriend. While Ren√©e tries to tell the police they had a mutual pact to kill themselves, they do not believe her, and Pierre is brought to jail. Once out of the hospital, Ren√©e returns to the hotel where she is offered a job as maid and waitress until she gets herself back on her feet. Attractive, young, and famous because of her suicide attempt, Ren√©e becomes popular with the men in the hotel and bar. Edmond, who was going to leave for the south of France with Raymonde, changes his plans when he sees that Ren√©e has returned to the hotel. He falls in love with her; he declares this love, telling her how he used to be a crook, and even now is hiding from two men. Ren√©e and Edmond make plans to leave Paris and begin anew, but Ren√©e changes her mind at the last minute and returns to the hotel to wait for Pierre‚Äôs release from prison. Edmond follows Ren√©e back to town to say goodbye. As the two meet, in the crowds in the street, she tips him off that the men pursuing him, await him, upstairs right now, in the hotel. Edmond goes upstairs, opening the chamber door upon his foe; pulling the small pistol from his vest, he tosses it, lightly, onto the bed at the knees of his pursuer. So Edmond dies‚Äîbut no one hears the shots from the little pistol this time, because, outside, the playful boys' firecrackers continue going off, amidst the commotion on the street, this Bastille Day.

With Hotel du Nord, Carn√© reduced any politics to that of the romantic relationships. In 1938, Carn√© developed Eug√®ne Dabit's novel Hotel du Nord into a film treatment. Dabit's book was popular in France and had won the 1929 Populist Prize. The author was the son of the owners of the real Hotel du Nord which, like the film, was located along the Canal Saint-Martin in Paris. Dabit was never able to see the film, having died of scarlet fever in 1936. Carn√© initially thought of his friend Jacques Pr√©vert to write the screenplay but he was busy with other projects. He then turned to Jean Aurenche and Henri Jeanson to write the script. They readily agreed and were excited by the idea of a modest Parisian hotel with a cast of colorful characters. Carn√© and his roommate Maurice Bessy (editor of French movie magazine Cin√©monde), went to the real H√¥tel du Nord to soak up the atmosphere and get inspiration for how the film should look. Bessy later wrote an article about the visit that was published in the August, 1938 edition of Cin√©monde. For the leading role, Carne's production compay Sedif suggested a rising young actress with the innocent beauty and looks that was so popular in films of the time. Annabella's previous pictures had sold very well in the European market and she even had an offer to make a film in Hollywood. She was paired with Jean- Pierre Aumont. They had previously played star-crossed lovers in Anatole Litvak's 1935 film L'Equipage. For the role of doomed pimp Edmond, Carne selected Louis Jourvet with whom he had previously directed in Drole de Drame(1935). For the vindictive Raymonde, Carne chose Arletty. Carne would go on to cast her in four of his subsequent films. Jourvet and Arletty are remembered as French cinema's most iconic pairings with their darkly comic bickering making up the most memorable moments of the film. Filming Because of the political implications of the time (Hitler's recent invasion of Czechoslavakia), the filmmakers wanted to shoot quickly to avoid any delays that could be caused by the outbreak of war. Carn√© and his producer Joseph Lucachevitch, thought that it would be too difficult to shoot the film in its real location on the Canal Saint-Martin. Instead, they reconstructed the hotel and canal at the Billancourt Studios. For the canal, they actually dug ditches and filled them with water on land outside the studio that was owned by the local cemetery. Lucachevitch invited journalists and French society to an event held at the set to promote the film in the summer of 1938. The film required elaborate set pieces, but the film's most elaborate sequence is the nighttime Bastille Day street celebration as it required over four hundred extras. Reception The film was previewed on December 10, 1938, at the Cinema Marivaux in Paris. Critics applauded the film \\"sunny\\" and noted Carne's elaborate staging. Contemporary critics had a mixed response to the film. Time Out called it, \\"a very likeable film, but...Carn√©'s 'poetic realism' seems a trifle thin and hesitant in this populist yarn about a sleazy Parisian hotel and its inhabitants.\\" Film critic Richard Roud called Hotel du Nord \\"delightful but unimportant.\\" Senses of Cinema noted that Hotel du Nord has been ignored by contemporary critics because it came between Carne's two masterpieces Port of Shadows and Le jour se l√®ve. Legacy It is in this film that Arletty says the famous line, \\"Atmosphere! Atmosphere! Do I have an atmosphere hangover?\\" It became one of the most famous lines of French cinema history. ‚ÄúThe words sound like they came out of a conjurer's hat. It is the same in all languages. I can't say it or hear it anymore. Besides, it no longer belongs to me. It belongs to the public and I know that in the mouths of many strangers, it is a pledge of their friendship. When I reread the novel by Eug√®ne Dabit from which the film is based a little later, I saw that these words were not mentioned there once. It was a pure invention of Jeanson . A poet's find.\\" - ArlettyQuote from Arletty at letter A on page 19 of Les Mots d'Arletty collected and presented by Claudine Br√©court-Villars, √©ditions de Fanval, Paris, 1988 ( ) According to Marcel Achard: ‚ÄúJeanson's dialogue is overwhelming. It is the best of all those he has done to date, and it is the most varied, the simplest, the most airy, the most brilliant of all the dialogues of cinema ‚Äù\\"I Am as I Am,\\" memories of Arletty established with the collaboration of Michel Souvais, Vertiges du Nord / Carr√®re editions, May 1987, Paris ( ) . Page 127: extract from Marcel Achard's quote published in the daily Paris-Soir when the film was released. While Arletty and Marcel Achard refer to the screenwriter Henri Jeanson as the author of the famous line, in his film, Voyage through French Cinema (2016), Bertrand Tavernier says that it would be the screenwriter Jean Aurenche who would have slipped this line in response to the reproach that Marcel Carn√© addressed to him repeatedly for making films ‚Äúwhich lack atmosphere.‚Äù However, as Jacques Lourcelles points out in his Dictionary of Cinema, this line highlights less the strength of the dialogues of the film than the genius of Arletty who, from a line which could have been rather heavy, succeeded in creating an unforgettable line which became a symbol of Parisian banter. Marcel Carn√©, himself, writes in his book of memories, \\"La Vie √† Belles Dents,‚Äú \\"It must be said that Arletty was the soul of the film. Not only did she transcend certain lines, certain author's words that I hardly liked because of their outrageous style, like the famous ‚ÄúAtmosphere‚Äù to which her talent, her artistic magic, made her a success that we remember.\\"Marcel Carn√©, La Vie √† belles dents, √âditions Jean-Pierre Olivier, Paris, 1975, page 137. Arletty said, ‚ÄúNothing is out of fashion in this movie. Not a sentence. Not a word. This is not slang - slang goes out of fashion - it 's pictures. There is nothing to take away, nothing to put back. It is a piece \\"made\\", a score.\\"Quote from Arletty at letter H on page 63 of Les Mots d'Arletty collected and presented by Claudine Br√©court-Villars, √©ditions de Fanval, Paris, 1988 ( ) Adaptation L'H√¥tel du Nord is an award-winning novel by Eug√®ne Dabit, the first Prix du Roman Populiste, and is a loose collection of sentimental tales about simple people residing in a hotel. The novel begins with Monsieur and Madame Lecouvreur buying and transforming a rundown hotel. The film begins with the hotel already up and running and gives no real mention of how the hotel came about. So too, the novel ends with the Lecouvreur's reluctantly selling the hotel to a large company that plans to construct an office building on the site and the tenants must unhappily leave and separate. The film's ending is entirely modified and not only is the hotel not being demolished, but the film ends with the sense that this place and the people there are left standing in time untouched by the outside world. So too, the film focuses on criminals, prostitutes, and vagabonds, and develops the novel's sentimental, rather than political, themes.

Jordan (born c. 1941) is an American physician and Democratic Party politician who served as the 37th Mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey. He succeeded interim mayor Charles K. Krieger. Being 30 years old at the time of his election, Jordan is the youngest mayor in the history of Jersey City. Biography After graduating from medical school in 1968, Jordan ran a drug rehabilitation center in Jersey City. His political involvement began when he joined a local reform group called the Community Action Council. Jordan was first elected as a reform candidate in a special election following the resignation of Thomas J. Whelan after Whelan's conviction for extortion and conspiracy. Jordan's election was hailed as an end to machine control of Jersey City politics, and was credited to support from a large number of young voters. He was re-elected to a full four-year term in 1973. Jordan was the first mayor to propose a major redevelopment of the Jersey City waterfront. During his term, Jordan appointed Shirley Tolentino as the first African- American woman to serve as a full-time municipal court judge in New Jersey. In 1977, Jordan simultaneously ran for reelection in Jersey City's non-partisan May election and for the Democratic nomination for Governor of New Jersey, with the primary held in June. Jordan used an aggressive television advertising campaign that was estimated to cost up to $200,000. After losing the mayoral election, he withdrew from the gubernatorial primary and supported incumbent Governor Brendan Byrne. Jordan's campaign later received a $30,000 campaign contribution from Byrne's campaign, allowing him to retire 25% of his campaign debt. Jordan retired from politics and returned to his medical career following his withdrawal from the primary. He later served as the Chairman of Emergency Medicine at Trinitas Hospital in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Jordan currently serves as a member of the New Jersey State Board of Human Services and served as its chairman from 1991 until 1996. He is also the treasurer of the State Board of Medical Examiners.

The WBA welterweight title bout took place on July 26, 2008, at the MGM Grand in Paradise, Nevada, and resulted in an eleventh round technical knockout victory for Margarito. Both men had previously fought on April 12 and emerged victorious, thus clearing the way for a July 26 match between the two boxers. It was Cotto's first fight in Las Vegas since December 2004. According to promoter Bob Arum, the bout took place in Las Vegas to promote Cotto to a new audience while also appealing to Margarito's Mexican American fans in California. Cotto entered the fight as The Ring magazine's #1 ranked boxer in the welterweight division and #6 in their pound-for-pound rankings. Margarito entered the match as The Ring magazine's #4 ranked welterweight. Press conferences were held in Mexico, Los Angeles, New York City, and Puerto Rico to promote the world title bout. Cotto and Margarito's aggressive boxing styles led to much praise from multiple boxing writers. Kevin Iole of Yahoo! Sports named it the third-best boxing match of 2008 and the fight generated 450,000 pay-per-view buys, the third-highest in 2008 for a boxing match. Margarito was later suspected of cheating in this bout after controversy arose over his use of hand wraps after his bout with Shane Mosley. Background=Miguel Cotto Miguel Cotto (right) against Oktay Urkal on March 3, 2007 After making six successful defenses of the World Boxing Organization (WBO) light welterweight title, Cotto moved up in weight class to the welterweight division and defeated Carlos Quintana on December 2, 2006 to win the World Boxing Association (WBA) welterweight title. Cotto's first title defense came against mandatory challenger Oktay Urkal in a bout that took place on March 3, 2007, at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan, Puerto Rico. A mandatory challenger is a boxer who is chosen by a boxing organization to fight for their title. If the champion decides not to defend the title against the mandatory challenger, the boxing organization strips him of his title. In attendance for the bout was former undisputed welterweight champion Zab Judah, who was expected to be Cotto's next opponent as long as Cotto defeated Urkal and Judah won his fight in April. Cotto displayed a dominant performance against Urkal, eventually to the point where Urkal's corner retired in the eleventh round. On April 13, 2007, Judah's match with journeyman boxer Ruben Galvan ended in a no contest after a severe cut opened up around Galvan's hairline, which was ruled to have been caused by Judah's elbow. Despite the no contest, the bout between Cotto and Judah went ahead as planned, taking place at Madison Square Garden in New York City on June 9, 2007. In front of a sellout crowd of 20,658, Cotto defeated Judah by technical knockout in the eleventh round. In his next fight, Cotto fought former three-division champion Shane Mosley on November 10, 2007. Mosley had originally set his sights on fighting World Boxing Council (WBC) welterweight champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr., but Mayweather was in negotiations to fight Ricky Hatton, and on July 28, 2007, Mayweather and Hatton officially agreed to the fight. With the two fights scheduled to take place a month apart from each other, the media speculated that the winners of the two fights would likely fight each other next. Cotto was successful in his third title defense, defeating Mosley by unanimous decision at Madison Square Garden in New York City, while one month later, Mayweather defeated Hatton by tenth round technical knockout at the MGM Grand in Paradise, Nevada. Following his victory, Mayweather announced that he would take a two-year layoff from boxing to focus on his promotional company. However, one month later, Mayweather began negotiations for a rematch with Oscar De La Hoya. With several top welterweight fighters unavailable, Cotto agreed to fight Alfonso Gomez, a fighter most notable for appearing on the first season of The Contender. The match took place on April 12, 2008, at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and resulted in a victory for Cotto after the ring doctor stopped the fight after round five. Antonio Margarito Antonio Margarito On July 21, 2001, Margarito's bout with WBO welterweight champion Daniel Santos ended in a no contest after the fighters' heads collided in the first round and a deep cut was opened over the corner of Margarito's right eyebrow. He would get another opportunity to win the WBO title on March 16, 2002 against Antonio Diaz. Margarito defeated Diaz by tenth round technical knockout to win the title, which had been vacated by Santos. Seven months later, he made his first successful defense of the WBO title with a unanimous decision victory over Danny Perez. His second title defense came against former WBA welterweight champion Andrew Lewis at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas on February 8, 2003. Margarito won the fight by second round technical knockout after a significant amount of punches from Margarito led to a stoppage from the referee. On January 31, 2004, at the Dodge Theatre in Phoenix, Arizona, Margarito defeated Hercules Kyvelos by second round technical knockout in his third title defense. After the fight, he discussed his interest in a major fight with Oscar De La Hoya, Shane Mosley, or Fernando Vargas. In his next fight, Margarito moved up in weight class for a rematch with Daniel Santos, who possessed the WBO junior welterweight title. The fight took place on September 11, 2004 and ended in a technical decision victory for Santos after Margarito was cut over the right eye by an unintentional headbutt in round six. After round nine it was ruled Margarito could not continue, so the fight was decided on the scorecards and Santos led 86-85, 87-84 on two cards while Margarito was ahead 86-85 on the third scorecard. After the loss, Margarito moved back down in weight to defend his WBO welterweight title against Sebastian Lujan on February 18, 2005. He won the fight by technical knockout in the tenth round and set up a fight against Kermit Cintron, who was in attendance for Margarito's fight with Lujan. On April 23, 2005, Margarito defeated the less experienced Cintron, knocking him down four times en route to a technical knockout victory in the fifth round at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. Margarito's next fight took place on February 18, 2006, when he defeated Manuel Gomez by technical knockout in just 74 seconds in Las Vegas. After Floyd Mayweather, Jr. defeated Zab Judah on April 8, 2006, he rejected an $8 million offer from promoter Bob Arum to fight Margarito on August 12, 2006, citing a hand injury as the reason he did not take the bout. On December 2, 2006, Margarito successfully defended the WBO welterweight title for the seventh time with a unanimous decision victory over Joshua Clottey. On July 14, 2007, Margarito fought Paul Williams in his eighth title defense at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California. With a victory, Margarito would set himself up for a welterweight title unification match against Miguel Cotto in the autumn, but Margarito lost to Williams by unanimous decision. Four months later, Margarito knocked out Golden Johnson in the first round at Madison Square Garden in New York City. On April 12, 2008, Margarito had a rematch with Kermit Cintron, who held the IBF welterweight title. The match took place on the undercard of Cotto's fight with Alfonso Gomez and Margarito knocked out Cintron in the sixth round to win the title. Pre-fight information The MGM Grand, site of \\"The Battle\\" Both fighters' victories on April 12 cleared the way for a July 26 showdown between Cotto and Margarito. The WBA welterweight title fight took place at the MGM Grand Las Vegas, marking the first time Cotto headlined a Las Vegas card. It was Cotto's first fight in Las Vegas since December 11, 2004, on the undercard of Vitali Klitschko's bout with Danny Williams. According to Bob Arum, the match took place in Las Vegas to promote Cotto to a new audience while also appealing to Margarito's Mexican American fans in California. The Las Vegas notion gained momentum in the previous month when the Nevada Athletic Commission amended its provisional rules on glove size, allowing welterweights to wear 8 ounce (227 g) gloves instead of the previously mandated 10 ounce (284 g) gloves. Nearly every other boxing jurisdiction in the United States allows welterweights to fight with 8 ounce gloves, and both Cotto and Margarito likely would have refused to fight in Las Vegas without their usual glove size. Margarito had to vacate the IBF welterweight title after the IBF mandated him to defend the title against Joshua Clottey. Press conferences were held in Mexico, Los Angeles, New York City, and Puerto Rico to promote the world title bout. Cotto entered the fight as The Ring magazine's #1 ranked boxer in the welterweight division and #6 in their pound-for-pound rankings. Margarito entered the match as The Ring magazine's #4 ranked welterweight. The official judges for the bout were Dave Moretti, Jerry Roth, and Glen Hamada, and the referee was Kenny Bayless. Serving as the ring announcer for the fight was Michael Buffer. Promoted by Arum's Top Rank Boxing promotional company, the match aired on Home Box Office (HBO) Pay-Per-View. Cotto entered the fight as a two-to-one betting favorite, and the official attendance for the event was 10,477. Both Margarito and Cotto weighed in at the welterweight limit of . Opinions Cotto and Margarito's aggressive boxing styles led to much speculation of a potential fight of the year candidate. Junior welterweight titleholder Paulie Malignaggi said that the fight would be \\"pure entertainment\\", and HBO commentator Jim Lampley said that \\"I'm asking for one of my top 10 fights in my 22 years of calling fights on television\\". Dave Larzelere of Sporting News wrote that the bout had \\"the potential to be one of those epic Irresistible Force vs. Immoveable Object kind of battles that we talk about forever afterwards, √† la Hagler/Hearns or Corrales/Castillo\\". Jeff Haney of the Las Vegas Sun described the fight as \\"not only the sport‚Äôs most promising matchup of the year. It also conjures memories of past fights in which regional or national pride was at stake\\", noting the rivalry between Mexico and Puerto Rico. The Arizona Republic wrote, \\"Cotto, an impassive and intimidating Puerto Rican, and Margarito, a patient and tough Mexican, are another chapter in a rivalry rich in legends and still productive\\". Yahoo! Sports writer Kevin Iole felt that the boxing match would provide a performance similar to that of the fight between Jose Luis Castillo and Diego Corrales, which was named fight of the year by The Ring magazine. Bout summary Margarito, traditionally a sluggish starter, anticipated to emerge swift, but it was Cotto who got off to a more effective start by throwing numerous punches and applying plenty of movement. Cotto picked up where he left off in the second round, approaching directly at Margarito though easily getting by harm's way once Margarito sought to counterpunch. That, nevertheless, changed approximately a minute into the round, as Margarito landed a right hand that momentarily had Cotto by the ropes. Margarito directed his assault to Cotto's body, but Cotto landed various left hooks. Blood started descending from Cotto's nose, but did not discourage him from closing the round by landing a punch upon Margarito. Mobility represented the key for Cotto in the third round, efficaciously blending boxing and brawling while trying to minimize the blood flow from his nose and a small cut over his left eye. Margarito continued targeting the body, but drew two distinguish warnings for low blows in the span of less than a minute. Margarito closed the gap sufficiency in the fourth round by landing a right uppercut and attacking Cotto's body to slow him down. In the fifth round, Cotto provided plenty of lateral movement which frustrated Margarito. Cotto persisted on the move and would land a flurry of punches prior to directly escaping harm's way. Margarito landed a straight right hand that had Cotto temporarily unsteady with ten seconds to go, but Cotto eluded all of the ensuing punches until the final bell. While Margarito did not land a lot of punches, he remained the more engaged fighter in the sixth round. A left hook to the body had Cotto on the defensive early in the seventh round, but he was able to fend off additional difficulty. A right hand from Cotto slowed Margarito, but he returned with punches that forced Cotto to clinch. Margarito commanded the bulk of the round, throwing 130 punches in the round according to Compubox. Cotto was advocated by his corner in between rounds to stay off the ropes. He obliged, providing lateral movement throughout the round but with approximately 30 seconds left, Margarito was able to trap Cotto in a corner, but Cotto managed to escape. It was more of the same in the ninth round, with Cotto going back and forth between southpaw and conventional stance. Margarito continued charging ahead, although Cotto would counterpunch sufficiency to avoid Margarito. The same pattern applied as in the previous two rounds, with Margarito charging forward and Cotto using movement while anticipating chances to counterpunch. Margarito immediately concluded the gap in the final 15 seconds, landing a left hook, left uppercut and right hand that had Cotto against the ropes. Halfway through the eleventh round, a left uppercut by Margarito left Cotto vulnerable as he took a knee after Margarito landed a right uppercut and two right hands. Cotto managed to get up, but he went down again, despite Margarito not landing another punch. The referee moved in to count, but Evangelista Cotto, Cotto's trainer and uncle, climbed onto the ring apron and threw in the towel. The official time of the stoppage was 2:05 of round eleven. Post-fight Dan Rafael of ESPN.com described the fight as a \\"riveting slugfest with a dramatic ending that left the throbbing crowd of 10,477 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in ecstasy\\". The referee for the bout Kenny Bayless called it \\"the best fight I've ever done\\". Fightnews.com writers Andreas Hale and Victor Perea called it \\"an instant classic that gave boxing fans all over the world all they could handle...and then some\\". Dave Larzelere of Sporting News wrote that it \\"was unquestionably the fight of the year\\".

BoxingScene.com writer Jake Donovan wrote that \\"It was brutal, and lived up to everyone's exceedingly high expectations\\". Kevin Iole of Yahoo! Sports named it the third best boxing match of 2008. The fight generated 450,000 pay-per-view buys, the third highest in 2008 for a boxing match. Following the victory, Margarito became The Ring magazine's #1 ranked boxer in the welterweight division, and he replaced Cotto in their rankings as the #6 ranked boxer in the world, pound-for-pound. For Cotto, The Ring magazine dropped him to #3 in their welterweight rankings and #10 in their pound-for-pound rankings. With the loss, Cotto's fight with Oscar De La Hoya, which would have guaranteed Cotto $25 million, was off. De La Hoya instead opted to fight The Ring magazine's #1 ranked pound-for-pound boxer Manny Pacquiao on December 6, 2008, at the MGM Grand Las Vegas. Margarito made his first title defense against Shane Mosley on January 24, 2009, losing to him by technical knockout in the ninth round. The California State Athletic Commission revoked the licenses of Margarito and his trainer Javier Capetillo for a year on February 10, 2009, after it was discovered before the fight that a plaster-like substance on illegal pads was found inside Margarito's hand wraps. On February 21, 2009, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Cotto claimed the vacant WBO welterweight title by defeating Michael Jennings by fifth round technical knockout. In his second title defense, Cotto defeated former IBF welterweight champion Joshua Clottey by split decision at Madison Square Garden on June 13, 2009. The pair had a rematch, which Cotto won by tenth round technical knockout.

It lies at a distance of about fifty kilometers to the west from the province seat Burdur. Lake Salda is often included in the Turkish Lakes Region that extends across inner western to southern Anatolia, especially Isparta Province and Afyonkarahisar Province, although Lake Salda is geographically separate from the larger lakes, which are more to the west and, being a crater lake, is morphologically different from these tectonic lakes. Lake Salda The lake area covers 4,370 hectares, and its depth reaches 196 meters, making it one of the deeper lakes in Turkey, if not the deepest. The lake sedimentary records show high resolution climate changes that are related to solar variability during the last millennium.Danladi, I. B., & Ak√ßer-√ñn, S. (2017). Solar forcing and climate variability during the past millennium as recorded in a high altitude lake: Lake Salda (SW Anatolia). Quaternary International The lake is a popular excursion spot for people across the region or from beyond, the more so due to the hydromagnesite mineral found in its coastal waters, which is believed to offer remedies for certain dermatological diseases. The shorelines, surrounded by black pine forests, are also popular among hunters, the game and the fowl available including quails, hares, foxes, boars and wild ducks, aside from the lake's fish. White sandy beaches, limpid water and seven crystal-white islets within the lake complete the scenery. A township that starts almost at the shore to the southwest of the lake carries the same name, Salda. The local administrative seat of Ye≈üilova is located to the east of the lake at a distance of about four kilometers and Ye≈üilova municipality manages the lake's camping facilities. Its peculiar morphology has led to a number of academic studies conducted on Lake Salda. The unusual alkaline nature of the lake means that is one of the few locations where ancient stromatolite algae still grows. The environmental authority wants to protect Lake Salda with a huge national park project. The Salda Lake National Park is in construction and should be finished in 2023.

The church is a rectangular wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and mostly clapboarded exterior. The front facade is finished flushboarding, and is sheltered by a projecting four-column Ionic portico. The columns support a fully pedimented gable, which houses a series of recessed panels. The main facade is blank except for the main entrance and wide corner pilasters. The entrance opening is framed by pilasters and topped by a broad corniced entablature; the doorway within the opening is framed by paneling matching that of the door. The church's tower rises to a height of in square tiered stages. The church was built in 1844, when the community was at the height of its prosperity, and is one of Berkshire County's finest examples of Greek Revival church architecture. It was built by a Reformed Methodist congregation as its second sanctuary, the first having been destroyed by fire. The house was built around the same time as the church as a private residence, and was only acquired for use as a parsonage in 1903. The parsonage is a modest 1-1/2 story gable-front structure, with a single-story ell (a 20th-century addition) extending to the south.

His first teacher of drawing was Arthur Ernest Pearce, who later became head designer to Royal Doulton potteries. In 1888 he studied art under Fred Brown at the Westminster School of Art before moving to the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris. Amongst his fellow students were Paul S√©rusier, Pierre Bonnard, √âdouard Vuillard and Maurice Denis. Bevan made his first visit to Brittany with a fellow student Eric Forbes-Robertson in 1890 and stayed at the Villa Julia, in Pont-Aven. He made a second visit in the autumn of the following year before travelling to Morocco by way of Madrid to study Velasquez and Goya at first hand. He appears to have done more fox-hunting in Tangier than drawing in the company of the artists Joseph Crawhall and George Denholm Armour and was Master of the Tangier Hunt in his second season. Breton Churchyard, c. 1893 Bevan returned to Brittany in 1893. There is no evidence that he had ever met Van Gogh but it is obvious in the swirling trees and landscape of his Breton drawings that he knew his work. It is known that he was friendly with Paul Gauguin, who gave him several prints. Bevan also received encouragement from Renoir, particularly in his drawing of horses. Although not evident in the few paintings that survive from this period it is in his drawings, early prints, and two surviving wax panels that the obvious influence of Pont-Aven synthetism can be seen. On his return to England in 1894 Bevan went to live on Exmoor where he was able to combine painting with hunting. Married life Breton Mother and Child, c. 1894 In the summer of 1897 Bevan met the Polish painter Stanis≈Çawa de Kar≈Çowska at the wedding of Polish art student Janina Flamm with Eric Forbes-Robertson in Jersey. At the end of the year Bevan and de Kar≈Çowska married in Warsaw. Her father had extensive land in central Poland and for the remainder of their married life they would make long summer visits there. In 1900 the Bevans settled in London at 14 Adamson Road, Swiss Cottage. Their first child, Edith Halina (Mrs Charles Baty), had been born in December 1898 and their second, Robert Alexander, in March 1901. The summers of 1901, 1903 and 1904 were spent in Poland and it was here that some of his most colourful work was produced. The influence of Gauguin was a key role in Bevan's development, helping him to discover the pure colour which led him to a premature Fauvism in 1904.

Sir Philip Hendy, in his preface to the 1961 Bevan retrospective exhibition at Colnaghi's, commented that Bevan was perhaps the first Englishman to use pure colour in the 20th Century. He was certainly far in advance of his Camden Town colleagues in this respect.\\"Christie's.

Camden Town Group Horse Sale at the Barbican, 1912 In May 1911 the decision was made to form a new exhibiting society from the ranks of Fitzroy Street and so the Camden Town Group was founded. The end of that year saw Bevan moving away from the portrayal of the cab yards to the London horse sales at Tattersalls, Aldridges, the Barbican, and Wards (see Horse Sale at the Barbican, Tate Gallery and Under the Hammer, Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool). The Camden Town Group was short-lived. After three financially unsuccessful exhibitions Arthur Clifton, who ran the Carfax Gallery, declined to hold any more.

Until the end of his life Bevan continued to paint in the Bolham valley and nearby Luppitt his angular style sitting well with the strong patterning of the landscape. His London street scenes, which were largely in the area of St John's Wood and Belsize Park, were generally more favourably reviewed than his landscapes.Frances Stenlake, Robert Bevan from Gauguin to Camden Town.

Built in 1905 and enlarged several times, it was one of the first poured concrete buildings in the United States, and was one of Greenfield's grandest hotels of the early 20th century. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The former Weldon Hotel stands in what is a mainly residential area northeast of downtown Greenfield, on the west side of High Street. It is a five-story structure, built out of poured and block concrete on a raised basement. It is framed in iron, with floors and walls of poured concrete finished in blocks of varying texture. The lower levels have rusticated finish, and the upper levels have a smooth finish. Bowed window bays project at the building corners, and there are balconies in some side-facing units. The hotel was designed by William B. Reid, an architect from Holyoke. The first part of the building was built in 1905 as an apartment house, but was converted into a hotel in 1907. F. O. Wells, the proprietor, was thought to be overly ambitious in operating such a large hotel, but his business eventually improved in the 1910s with the opening of the Mohawk Trail. It is said the name \\"Weldon\\" comes as a contraction of \\"Well Done\\". In 1914 Wells added a dining room on the north side of the building, and in 1927 added sixty rooms above that addition. When traffic on the Mohawk Trail went into decline, the hotel also declined, and closed in 1977. The building has since been converted into a senior living facility.

Description and history Greenfield's main post office occupies a prominent location in downtown Greenfield, on the north side of Main Street opposite the Franklin County Courthouse. It consists of a two-story main block, with virtually identical single-story wings extending to either side.

The main character is Reba Hart, played by Reba McEntire. Reba Nell Hart Reba is the main protagonist of the series. She is played by Reba McEntire and appears in every episode. A fiery redhead who has a bullying, confrontational, sarcastic personality, Reba tries to take control of every situation, which more often than not makes problems worse before they get better. Nevertheless, she is very warm and loving towards her three children and while initially hostile to Brock and Barbra Jean, she grows to forgive them throughout the series. It is mentioned that she developed a problem with authority during her childhood when she speaks to Brock's therapist, but had a very loving family growing up. In the first season, she is struggling to save her twenty-year marriage to Brock before she learns in a therapy session he is divorcing her to marry his pregnant girlfriend, Barbra Jean. In the same session, she also learns that her oldest child, 17-year-old Cheyenne, is also pregnant by her boyfriend, Van. She allows Van and Cheyenne to get married and move in with her, while her other children, Kyra and Jake, also stay with her. She initially refuses to be around Barbra Jean unless absolutely necessary and is equally hostile to Brock, though this begins to change after their divorce is finalized, Brock and Barbra Jean marry, and have their son, Henry. A short time later at high school graduation, Cheyenne goes into labor and gives birth to a daughter, Elizabeth, in the hospital. In the second season, Reba continues to move on from her divorce, even getting a boyfriend for a brief period, selling off her engagement ring, and accepting a job from Brock in his dental office. She later quits this job to work for Brock's arch-rival, Eugene, and helps Van and Cheyenne with parenthood and college plans. Reba also becomes more reflective, after attending an old boyfriend's funeral with Brock, she debates whether or not she made the right choice by marrying him at all. She also drew up a will after a near-death experience. A bombshell is dropped when Kyra, who had become increasingly distant when she spent more time with Brock and Barbra Jean due to all the attention Cheyenne and Van were drawing from Reba, plans to move in with them into their new house just four doors down from Reba's. In the third season, Reba struggles to move on after Kyra's departure, even trying to permanently avoid Brock and Barbra Jean, before she reconciles with Kyra. However, Kyra's move strained their relationship and is at the forefront of several episodes; Reba even agreed to spy on Kyra at Barbra Jean's assistance. Things move from Kyra to Brock when he tells Reba he intends to sell his dental practice to play pro-golf, a decision that enrages both Reba and Barbra Jean, but one that Brock insists is because he is not happy with his life. Fearing he will have another mid-life crisis, Reba develops empathy for Barbra Jean and opens up to Brock about her feelings after the divorce. Meanwhile, Reba tries to help Cheyenne pick a major, and when she picks dentistry, Reba is initially unsupportive, but agrees to support Cheyenne after she insists she can do it. In the fourth season, Reba mediates between Brock and Barbra Jean, and while tensions are running high, Barbra Jean kicks Brock out of the house. This allows Reba to develop more empathy for Brock, and in several episodes, she relates how he is going through the same pain she did during their separation. Brock uses this to suggest that she still has romantic feelings for him, which is supported by his therapist. To make things easier for Barbra Jean, Reba finally urges Brock to make a decision between playing pro golf and his dental practice-he chooses the latter to spend more time with Barbra Jean and Henry. Reba, convinced that Brock is finally changing for the better, begins to become more cordial to him. After Van suffers an injury that ends his career as a professional football player, Reba encourages him to find another exciting job. After losing her own job in the dental office for calling her boss \\"a monkey's butt,\\" she pursues a career in real estate and hires Van as her assistant. Jealous that he is a natural in the business, she insists he do boring work until he is better suited for the more important jobs. When she is inspecting Van's wardrobe, she discovers a bottle of alcohol in the closet-subsequently learning that Cheyenne had become an alcoholic. In the fifth season, Reba and the rest of the family try to help Cheyenne overcome her addiction and also work out her new partnership with Van. She is shocked to learn that Van no longer believed in God following his injury and demonstrates her more caring side when she asks their church's minister to help Van work out his problems, as well as when she allows a family devastated by Hurricane Katrina to stay with them. When Brock drops a bombshell on Reba that they owed the IRS $75,000 in back taxes, it rekindles her fury at Brock for being irresponsible. Because of the situation, Brock and Barbra Jean are prepared to lose their home, so Reba and Van decide to buy it and rent it out to them. Meanwhile, Reba also suffers health problems, in one episode she gets laser eye surgery because of her poor vision, and she collapses at Van and Cheyenne's second wedding because of high blood pressure. In the sixth season, it is revealed that Reba is still jealous of Barbra Jean, especially after Barbra Jean successfully lost weight. Reba starts to eat healthier so she will not become \\"the chubby friend.\\" When Brock suspects Barbra Jean is having an affair with her personal trainer, Reba goes to the gym to spy on her-only to find out that the trainer is homosexual. She also encourages Van to accept a job offer from a more prominent real estate agent, which he reluctantly accepts. She is overjoyed to learn from Van that Cheyenne is pregnant again and helps her with family planning-which unfortunately for Reba includes Van, Cheyenne, and Elizabeth moving into another house. When Reba covers for Brock (who had lied to Barbra Jean when he said he would be out of town), Brock and Barbra Jean decide to file for divorce. Kyra decides to move back in because she wants to spend her last year before college with Reba, but she and Kyra have trouble re-adjusting to each other due to Reba's stricter house rules. After Kyra considers several colleges, she decides to put her education on hold to go on tour with her band, a decision that enrages Reba initially but she later supports. In the series finale, Van and Cheyenne move back into Reba's house after a small fire at their own. Reba helps Brock and Barbra Jean work out their problems and they decide to stay married, Van and Cheyenne move back into their new home, and Reba says she has finally forgiven Barbra Jean for being the other woman in her marriage to Brock. She notes that she is happy being single before the theme song plays at the end of the episode. Brock Enroll Hart Brock is Barbra Jean's husband, Reba's ex-husband, and the father of Cheyenne, Kyra, Jake, and Henry. He is played by Christopher Rich. Brock is a dedicated father but is occasionally self-absorbed and tries to believe he is still a younger man. At the beginning of the series Brock is separated from Reba because of his affair with Barbra Jean, who was at the time a dental hygienist in his office. In the opening scene of the series, during a therapy session, he announces to Reba that he intends to marry a pregnant Barbra Jean, while he also learns that his eldest child Cheyenne is also pregnant by her boyfriend Van. Brock lived in a condo during his separation but often comes over to Reba's house to talk. In the seventh episode of the first season, Brock learned that his father, who he had never been very close to, had died. Brock and Reba bury his ashes on a golf course. Brock and Barbra Jean marry and while he is camping she goes into labor-Reba goes after him and the two make it to the hospital in time for Barbra Jean to have their son Henry. In the season finale Cheyenne gives birth to Brock's first grandchild, Elizabeth. In the second season Brock is living a quiet family life with Barbra Jean and Henry and gives Reba a job at his dental office. However, it is revealed he is having a hard time in his relationship with Barbra Jean when she confides in Reba that he is neglecting her. Brock also had a hard time with Reba's moving on since their marriage when she sells her engagement ring and the two attend a funeral for one of Reba's former boyfriends. They begin arguing over domestic issues, such as who will be the one to give their third child Jake his first bike. Brock also gets a vasectomy to prevent another unexpected pregnancy with Barbra Jean, which further strains their relationship. It is revealed that Brock is super competitive when he has a feud with fellow dentist Eugene (who is Reba's employer since she quit her earlier job at Brock's office) and tries to outdo Van on a double date with Cheyenne and Barbra Jean. Brock's mother Liz also appears, where she tells Reba she believes Brock made a mistake in his affair and shows obvious disapproval at Barbra Jean. Brock further infuriates Reba when he supports their second child Kyra's desire to move into Brock and Barbra Jean's new house-which is only four houses down from Reba's. In the third season Brock shows disapproval at Barbra Jean's mother hen nature over Kyra, but drops a bombshell when he reveals that he intends to sell his dental practice to become a professional golfer. Barbra Jean and Reba are both outraged, but while Barbra Jean is content to let Brock pursue his career, Reba urges him to return to his practice and family. Brock then admits to Reba that he is unhappy with his life and has been taking medication for anti-depressence. Barbra Jean is even more upset at his using \\"happy pills,\\" but Brock decides to continue on with his medication and pro golf dreams. In the dramatic season finale, Brock tells Reba he believes he made a mistake by marrying Barbra Jean. In the fourth season tensions between Brock and Barbra Jean are at an all-time high, and Barbra Jean kicks Brock out of the house. Brock moves back into the condo, the same condo he lived in during his separation from Reba. After Kyra encourages him and Barbra Jean to work out their problems, they begin to reconcile. Brock moves back into the house and allows Reba to sell his condo, and Barbra Jean buys a dog she names Broque. Brock believes that Reba still has feelings for him and remarks that his therapist \\"will have a field day with this!\\" When his therapist confronts Brock and Reba and asks if they still love each other, neither answers. In the fifth season, while Cheyenne is battling problems with an alcohol addiction, Brock secretly begins smoking again after he lectures Kyra and Jake not to do it. Brock becomes jealous of Reba's online boyfriend and reveals he still has some feelings for Reba. His problems with Barbra Jean are continued when his brother-in-law Buzzard shows up and calls Brock a \\"dirtbag.\\" Brock also has more than personal problems-Brock reveals to Reba that they owe the IRS $75,000 in back taxes and could lose his house over it. Reba is initially infuriated, but for Barbra Jean and Henry's sake she and Van agree to buy their home and rent it out to them. In the sixth season, Brock and Barbra Jean continue to have problems-especially after Barbra Jean loses a great deal of weight and becomes a successful weather reporter for the local news. The two decide to file for divorce after Brock continues to lie and deceive her-in one instance getting his vasectomy reversed so he can get Barbra Jean pregnant again. Brock suffers through the proceedings before in the series finale, Reba helps the two work out their problems, and Brock and Barbra Jean decide to stay married. Cheyenne Hart-Montgomery Cheyenne is Brock and Reba's eldest child, Van's wife, and the mother of Elizabeth and an unborn son. She is played by actress JoAnna Garcia. She is blonde and very intelligent, as well as kind and sensitive, and eager to help others. Through flashbacks in the third season, it was revealed that Cheyenne had encouraged her estranged parents to work things out, but to no avail. She also got pregnant by her boyfriend Van, the football star on the school team, and the two agreed they would raise the baby together. Her pregnancy was revealed during a therapy session her parents were required to attend, and afterward Van proposed to Cheyenne, who accepted. The two married at the end of the series pilot. After a brief honeymoon the two moved into Reba's house and continued high school, though the school principal did not want Cheyenne to continue attending and briefly suspended her because of her pregnancy (though she allowed Van to stay because of his position on the football team). Cheyenne, who had been co-captain of the high school drill team and shallow prior to her pregnancy, began to become more sensitive and humble, though she still was upset that Van was the favorite for the Prom King title and she was not for the Queen. Cheyenne went into labor just before graduation but did not tell anyone until she received her diploma. She gave birth to her daughter Elizabeth later that night in the hospital. In the second season, she and Van are struggling to raise Elizabeth and continue thinking about college. The baby also takes a toll on their finances, and they briefly apply for food stamps before Reba takes a job at Brock's dental office to cover the expenses. Throughout her own issues, Cheyenne encourages Reba to try speed-dating to find someone special, and encourages Van to reconcile with his parents (who had never supported his marriage and had kicked him out of the house after he told them about his intentions to marry Cheyenne). After a pregnancy scare, Van and Cheyenne move out for a time after Reba accidentally referred to Elizabeth as \\"a mistake.\\" The two reconcile with Reba and move back in. In the third season, Kyra, Cheyenne's younger sister who continually makes fun of her, moves out, taking an emotional toll on Reba. In an effort to convince her to move back in, Van and Cheyenne go to Brock and Barbra Jean's new house, where Kyra confronts them about how they had replaced her and Jake as the family in the house, then the two reconcile after both are in tears. Van and Cheyenne also prepare to pick college majors, and while Van is undecided, Cheyenne decides she wants to be a dentist like Brock. Reba does not support her choice because of her inability to commit to activities in the past, but Cheyenne insists she will be able to stick to her decision and pursues the career. She demonstrates her new adult perspective when she is upset that Van bought a car, a 1960s Mustang, without consulting her first. She celebrates her 21st birthday in the midst of a fight between Reba and Barbra Jean. In the fourth season, Van is traded to Denver, which takes an emotional toll on Cheyenne when she worries that he is enjoying being there without her. She and Elizabeth visit Denver several times until Van suffers a career-ending injury and the two are left with few financial options. Van is eventually hired to be Reba's new assistant in the real estate business and things begin to look up. In the season finale Reba discovers a bottle of alcohol in Van and Cheyenne's closet, and Cheyenne admits she has become an alcoholic. In the fifth season, Cheyenne becomes determined to beat her addiction, even trying smoking and Booze-Away pills before she attends a rehab center. Finally sober, she goes on a diet with Reba and Barbra Jean to help the latter overcome her food addiction. She volunteers at a homeless shelter and realizes that she wants to help people and changes her career choice to being a drug and alcohol counselor. In a unique anniversary gift, Van and Cheyenne decide to renew their wedding vows, but Reba collapses due to high blood pressure before they are able to, and Brock and Barbra Jean decide to renew theirs instead. In the sixth season, Cheyenne becomes pregnant again. Reba is overjoyed and begins helping her with family planning, but Cheyenne's hormones become insane for a brief period of time. After she is fine again she tells Reba that she, Van, and Elizabeth will need to buy a house to support their growing family, which Reba reluctantly agrees to. The two find out they are having a son, and Cheyenne dodges a promise she made to her father that she would name her son after him. The two buy an English-style house and after a small fire in the home the two move back in with Reba until the series finale, when the two move back into their new home. Van Montgomery Van is Cheyenne's husband and the son-in-law of Brock and Reba. He is played by actor Steve Howey. He is funny and a bit of a goofball, but he's also a loving and devoted husband and father. In the first season it is revealed that he impregnated Cheyenne, and they agree to marry. His parents disapproved of the marriage and kicked him out of the house, so Reba agrees to let him move in. Although he attempts to make up with his parents a few times, often at the urge of Reba or Cheyenne, it never works out because they do not approve of Cheyenne. Van is the star football player at the high school, and he uses this leverage by refusing to play when the principal tries to expel Cheyenne due to her pregnancy, forcing her to change her mind under pressure from the school. Van gets offered a scholarship to play football at USC, and they are excited about the idea of moving to California, but when Cheyenne experiences labor pains Reba successfully convinces them to go to the University of Houston where they will be close to family. Their daughter Elizabeth is born right after they graduated from high school. In the second season, Van and Cheyenne start college. His football scholarship is suspended when he injures his knee, so they are forced to move back in with Reba when they lose their off-campus housing. Van takes the semester off and becomes a house dad while Cheyenne continues school. They struggle financially and even apply for food stamps at one point, forcing Reba to take a job at Brock's office to help. Cheyenne again tries to get Van to reconcile with his wealthy parents so they can help with finances, but they shower Elizabeth with extravagant gifts, and it becomes a battle of who can be the better grandparents between them and Reba. Van eventually returns to playing football, making Cheyenne feel lonely as he has less time to spend with her. In the third season, Van quits college football and joins the Arena League so he can focus more on getting into the NFL. Reba initially disapproves and wants him to finish school, but she eventually accepts his decision. At times Van becomes a little too power happy with his new income, even going as far as buying a sports car without including Cheyenne in the decision. When they decide it's time to get their own apartment, they choose one that's too expensive and try to get Reba to co- sign the lease. When she refuses they forge her signature, but the deal falls through due to her poor credit rating. In the fourth season, Van hires a sports agent to help negotiate his contract. He gets traded to Denver, infuriating everyone, especially Cheyenne. Cheyenne becomes lonely with Van gone most of the time and is upset to learn he enjoys his time there even without her, especially since it means getting away from her family events when they are together. Van comes home with a broken tailbone, but the X-rays also reveal that he has spinal stenosis, which ends his football career. He receives a $100,000 buyout check from his team and spends it recklessly on gifts. Bored and not knowing what to do with himself, he finds other stuff to do like managing Kyra's band, playing online poker and attempting to train Jake in football. Reba eventually hires him to be her real estate assistant, and he turns out to be a natural. While inspecting his wardrobe, Reba discovers an empty bottle in the closet and suspects Van has become a drinker. She encourages him to go to Alcoholics Anonymous, but he forces Cheyenne to tell the truth that the bottle was actually hers. In the fifth season, Van admits he lost his faith in God when his football career ended. Reba tries to take him to see the Reverend, but he says Van can only be helped when he wants it. Reba and Van also spat at work a lot and are forced to see an occupational therapist. When it is revealed that Brock owes $75,000 in back taxes, Van and Reba agree to buy his house and rent it out to him and Barbra Jean. With their 5th anniversary coming up, Van and Cheyenne decide to renew their vows but get into an argument at the ceremony. It is cut short when Reba collapses due to high blood pressure and is rushed to the hospital. In the sixth season, a big real estate company offers Van a prominent position but leaves out Reba. He declines the position out of loyalty to her, but she eventually encourages him to take the job for his family's sake. Cheyenne becomes pregnant with a son, so they decide it's time to buy their first house together. They have several disagreements on how to decorate the house and whether or not Van should be trying to fix things. They are forced to temporarily move back in with Reba when a small fire is caused by Van's failed attempt to fix the heater. Kyra Eleanore Hart The middle child, Kyra has the fewest emotional issues of the family and as such, seems to be the most well adjusted. Many of her traits and looks come from Reba, most notably her strong use of sarcasm, although she's known to be more manipulative and difficult. She has a strained relationship with Cheyenne and likes to pick on Jake. At the end of the second season, Kyra is invited to go study in England for the summer thanks to her excellent social studies grades, but Reba is forced to spend the money that would have gone towards her trip on Cheyenne, who must take summer school in order to remain a full-time student. Tired of playing fifth fiddle to Cheyenne, Van, Elizabeth and Jake, she decides to move in with Brock and Barbra Jean. In the third season, when Kyra starts cancelling her mother-daughter dates with Reba, Reba suspects that Barbra Jean is making her babysit Henry too much while she's out enjoying her new life separated from Brock, so she asks Kyra to move back home. However, it is revealed that Barbra Jean is just acting and is actually very lonely, and Kyra tells Reba she wants to stay there because Barbra Jean needs her. Reba is proud of Kyra and her caring nature and agrees she should stay there. In the fourth season Kyra continues to grow up, seemingly too fast. Barbra Jean and Reba often have disagreements over how to handle her relationships, especially when she dates an older boy. She gets her driver's license and starts a band, which is managed by Van. For the first four seasons of the show, a recurring theme of Kyra's storylines was her social life being unreasonably micromanage (and sometimes blatantly sabotaged) because her parents, including Barbra Jean, live in mortal fear that she will meet a boy and suffer the same fate as Cheyenne, despite her being the most intelligent of the children(probably even smarter than Brock). With Kyra, this quickly becomes a source of anger if not outright hatred for Reba, Brock and B.J., because she in her eyes, Cheyenne has been rewarded with a husband and child for her irresponsibility, while Kyra is being punished for it. Kyra is absent for most of the fifth season due to Scarlett Pomers' real-life battle with anorexia nervosa. When she returns for the sixth season, Reba simply asks, \\"Where have you been?,\\" to which she replies, \\"I was getting something to eat.\\" In the sixth season, she decides to move back in with Reba so she can spend her final year before college with her mother. They go through some growing pains as she adjusts to Reba's stricter house rules. Cheyenne discovers that their strained relationship was started when she ruined Kyra's fifth birthday party by slamming one of her gifts into her cake out of jealousy. She apologizes to Kyra, and they attempt to improve their relationship. Kyra decides not to go to college and focus on her music. Reba puts her foot down and disapproves but eventually comes around and accepts the decision when Kyra temporarily moves out. Jake Mitchell Hart The youngest of the Hart children, Jake is often teased by his sister Kyra. Jake is pretty oblivious of what goes around behind him. He acts like a normal boy for his age, although in earlier seasons he displays so-called feminine interests that worries his father, Brock. Brock and Van try to teach him sports, but he is not very good, much to their chagrin. Barbra Jean Booker-Hart Barbra Jean, nicknamed \\"BJ\\", was Brock's dental hygienist and had an affair with him as his marriage to Reba was deteriorating. The result was her getting pregnant, and marrying him after he divorced Reba. Barbra Jean is even more of a goofball than Van, and is often an easy target for Reba's sarcasm. While noisy and annoying, Barbra Jean is a kind-hearted person with good intentions. Her tendency to tell \\"over-the-top\\" stories results in her sharing many random and often bizarre facts about her childhood and past. The most that can be understood is that she was born in Friendly, Texas, and at one point during her infancy was \\"the biggest baby in Juno County. \\" She has a sister, currently married, a brother named \\"Buzzard\\" (played by Bryan Callen of MADtv fame), and a father (\\"Big Daddy\\") who enjoys drinking and hunting. Brock is afraid of both \\"Buzzard\\" and \\"Big Daddy\\" because he knows they don't like him. She also claims to have an aunt who spits professionally. In the last season, she lost a large amount of weight and became a weather girl (she told people she was Stormy Clearweather). In the last episode, she got a job at the weather station as a news girl (she called her segment \\"Babs Janson:Street Walker.\\") Lori Ann Garner Reba's best friend. Introduced in season one in the episode \\"Every Picture Tells A Story.\\" Lori Ann was married and divorced three times, presumably because all three husbands cheated on her. Lori Ann was Reba's confidant on her problems with Brock and Barbra Jean and even Cheyenne. During Lori Ann's guest appearances on the series, she is always cruel and evil to Brock, (who is just as cruel and evil back to her), as well as Barbra Jean (who seems to like Lori Ann). One can assume this is because of what Brock and Barbra Jean did to Reba, along with her own personal feelings for Brock. In one of the earlier season plotlines, it's revealed that Lori Ann and Brock once dated before his marriage to Reba. Perhaps the reason Brock's animosity towards Lori Ann are due to his own repressed attraction for her.) Lori Ann's voracious sexual appetite is seen in her continual quest to find a lover. In the episode \\"Every Picture Tells A Story,\\" when Lori Ann says \\"men are pigs,\\" Brock retorts with: \\"Well you must love bacon cause you keep marrying us.\\" Even Reba herself describes Lori Ann as \\"a desperate, desperate woman\\" upon hearing that Lori Ann told a priest during confession that \\"he had nice eyes.\\" She enjoys relationships, but hates men, having commented that the only reason men and women get together is because the parts fit. In total, Lori Ann only made six appearances in the first season, and one in the second season. Her last episode was \\"Switch,\\" after that she was never seen again, but was referred to in fourth-season episode \\"Van's Agent,\\" where it was mentioned Lori Ann was going to Jamaica with a man who left the priesthood for her. However, she was never seen or mentioned again after that episode, or in any of the final two seasons of the show.

Life Betanzos was born in Betanzos in Galicia. He was one of the earliest Franciscan missionaries to Guatemala, and founder of the Church in Nicaragua. He is said to have acquired, in eight years, the use of fourteen Indian languages, including Nahuatl. In one year, he became fluent in Quich√©, Kaqchikel, and Zutuhil. It was during this time, and on account of his writings, that the controversy began between the Franciscans and Dominicans over the use of the Indian term \\"Cabovil\\" as a synonym for God. Betanzos insisted that they were not synonymous and always wrote \\"Dios\\", even in Indian idioms. The Dominicans on the other hand kept up the native term \\"Cabovil\\". The Franciscans were correct, in that the indigenous peoples had no conception of monotheism, and \\"Cabovil\\" does not means a personal supreme Deity. Betanzos died at Chomez, Nicaragua. Works Betanzos was one of the authors of a work published at Mexico and entitled, Arte, Vocabulario y Doctrina Christiana en Lengua de Guatemala. It is probably the book printed in Mexico previous to 1553 and ascribed to the \\"Franciscan Fathers\\", and also to Bishop Marroquin of Guatemala. No copy of it, however, is known to exist.

While a highly accomplished artist in his field, Seshendra Sharma is not well-off and has not been able to afford for his daughters, a conventional education. Both of them have achieved a respectable degree of proficiency ‚Äî Savitri in Carnatic classical music and Meenakshi in classical dance. Savitri, the elder daughter, is grateful for her knowledge and interest and looks forward to a life that will require her to hone her skills in the art. Meenakshi, on the other hand, is bitter about the lack of opportunity that she feels in the field of classical dance in India and resolves to make a simpler and more pleasurable life for herself as soon as possible, while confiding her ambitions only to her sister. Chandrasekhar (Venkatesh) is a tenant who has just moved in next door. He is a painter and is shown to be handling movie promotions as a large part of his work. He develops an interest in the neighbors and tries to help them in whatever way he can, partly because of his (unconfessed) interest in Meenakshi and partly because of his interest in the art which seems to be slowly fading from public life. The rest of the film is largely built around Meenakshi's journey from skepticism to devotion in her pursuit of dance. Chandrasekhar is shown to be an important catalyst in this transformation. Meenakshi becomes an accomplished dancer through the direction of renowned Odissi dancer Sharon Lowen, and gets the opportunity to go to the United States and perform. She learns of Chandrasekhar's love for her, and finally unites with Chandrasekhar, confessing her love for him as well.

Howard (1912 - 1994), a dentist by profession, gathered what is arguably the \\"largest collection\\" of drums in the Americas. Dr. Howard and his wife Bootsie travelled around the world over a period of 40 years amassing this collection of 800 drums, representing the drums and other musical instruments of cultures from Alaska to Argentina and from California to the Pacific islands, as well as Africa and Asia. The importance of his collection has been noted by experts on folk instruments at the Smithsonian Institution and were part of a major touring exhibit with artifacts collected by Fernando Ortiz the Cuban ethnographer who defined Afro-Cuban culture and wrote 30 books on the subject. Biography Howard was born in Venezuela and raised in Chicago, Illinois. Howard was an oral surgeon by profession who collected drums from around the world in his spare time after finding out his father was Kenyan. Over the years he amassed the largest collection of authentic drums in the Americas. Recently, his collection has been featured, along with elements of the Fernando Ortiz estate in a touring exhibit Ritmos de Identidad by the Smithsonian. Growing up in Chicago, Howard was fascinated with rhythm and drumming. Before he owned even one drum he would make improvised instruments out of whatever was around him. He attended Fisk University for his undergraduate degree and earned his doctorate at the University of Illinois in dental surgery. After marrying Tommy Berry in 1946 they relocated to Los Angeles in 1952, where Howard was exposed to a rich Latin drumming tradition. Howard's own mixed heritage, being of African, European and East Indian descent, was a constant backdrop to his musical interests. His daughter Victoria describes her father's passion as a \\"pursuit of identity through the eye of the drum.\\" He often described his family as \\"the fruit of the cross of cultures.\\" Collecting Howard and his wife were passionate collectors. She preferred African art, while his primary interest was in all things musical, for he not only collected the drums of many nations. He also collected stamps, books, photos, instrument making techniques and instruments to accompany the drums. He had a particular interest in the musical heritage of the Djuka people of Surinam and not only collected their instruments, but also acquired elaborately hand-carved furniture, including the double doors to his home. At first glance many of these items could easily be confused with African artifacts, but stylistically African instruments have become more utilitarian over the years. As Dr. Howard pointed out, to this researcher, during a visit to his home the Djuka people had maintained their culture in stasis due to the isolated nature of their existence. Because of the nature of his profession, Dr. Howard was able to arrange his schedule to accommodate yearly excursions abroad looking for folk instruments, which he defined as being those instruments that the folk actually used. In all of his collecting he always looked to purchase the instruments of the musicians themselves, as opposed to acquiring tourist versions of the instruments. Drums of the Americas Over the years his research led him to write several books and articles including the classic book Drums in the Americas and a catalog of the instruments in his collection which was meticulously cross-referenced and indexed. Dr. Howard understood drums to be sources of cultural history and pride, as evidenced by their place of honor in his home. The complete collection amounts to nearly 800 drums and other musical instruments from throughout the world. This unique ensemble represents musical traditions in Asia, the Pacific region, Europe, Africa and the Americas. Legacy Following his death in 1994, Victoria Howard sought to keep the memory of her father alive by contracting with The Craft and Folk Art Museum to put on an exhibit of her father's instruments. The event was so successful that other museums, including the Smithsonian, created their own traveling exhibits using a selection of instruments from the collection and the estate of Fernando Ortiz. Ritmos de Identidad: Fernando Ort√≠z‚Äôs Legacy and the Howard Collection of Percussion Instruments features more than 80 rare musical instruments from Howard's collection. Included are hand-painted sacred and secular drums, rattles and other percussion instruments from the Caribbean, South America and West Africa. The exhibit includes a variety of instruments made from \\"found objects\\", such as - a hoe blade and jaw bone, right alongside artifacts employing complex strung heads and tuning mechanisms. The collection is on loan from Howard's daughter. Bibliography * Howard, Joseph H.

History of a Six Weeks' Tour through a part of France, Switzerland, Germany, and Holland; with Letters Descriptive of a Sail Round the Lake of Geneva and of the Glaciers of Chamouni is a travel narrative by the English Romantic authors Mary Shelley and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Published anonymously in 1817, it describes two trips taken by Mary, Percy, and Mary's stepsister, Claire Clairmont: one across Europe in 1814, and one to Lake Geneva in 1816. Divided into three sections, the text consists of a journal, four letters, and Percy Shelley's poem \\"Mont Blanc\\". Apart from the poem, preface, and two letters, the text was primarily written and organised by Mary Shelley. In 1840 she revised the journal and the letters, republishing them in a collection of Percy Shelley's writings. Part of the new genre of the Romantic travel narrative, History of a Six Weeks' Tour exudes spontaneity and enthusiasm; the authors demonstrate their desire to develop a sense of taste and distinguish themselves from those around them. The romantic elements of the work would have hinted at the text's radical politics to nineteenth- century readers. However, the text's frank discussion of politics, including positive references to the French Revolution and praise of Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, was unusual for a travel narrative at the time, particularly one authored primarily by a woman. Although it sold poorly, History of a Six Weeks' Tour received favourable reviews. In proposing another travel narrative to her publisher in 1843, Mary Shelley claimed \\"my 6 weeks tour brought me many compliments\\". Biographical background Percy Bysshe Shelley imbibed his radical philosophy from William Godwin's Political Justice. (Amelia Curran, 1819) Mary Godwin and Percy Shelley met and fell in love in 1814. Percy Shelley initially visited the Godwin household because he was interested in meeting his philosophical hero, Mary's father, William Godwin. However, Mary and Percy soon began having secret rendezvous, despite the fact that Percy was already married. To Mary's dismay, her father disapproved of their extramarital affair and tried to thwart the relationship. On 28 July 1814, Mary and Percy secretly left for France, taking Mary's stepsister, Claire Clairmont, with them. The trio travelled for six weeks, from 28 July to 13 September 1814, through France, Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands (which is referred to as \\"Holland\\"); however, they were forced to return to England due to financial considerations. The situation upon their return was fraught with complications: Mary had become pregnant with a child who would soon die, she and Percy now found themselves penniless, and, to Mary's genuine surprise, her father refused to have anything to do with her. In May 1816, Mary Godwin, Percy Shelley, and their second child travelled to Geneva with Claire Clairmont. They spent the summer months with the Romantic poet Lord Byron, but, as Mary Shelley later wrote of the year without a summer, \\"[i]t proved a wet, ungenial summer and incessant rain often confined us for days to the house\\". The group spent their time writing, boating on Lake Geneva, and talking late into the night. Sitting around a log fire at Byron's villa, the company also amused themselves by reading German ghost stories, prompting Byron to suggest they each write their own supernatural tale. Mary Godwin began writing what she assumed would be a short story, but with Percy Shelley's encouragement and collaboration, she expanded this tale into her first novel, Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus. Mary, Percy, and Claire returned to England in September and on 30 December 1816 Percy and Mary married (two weeks after the death of Percy's first wife), healing the family rift. In March 1817, the Shelleys and Claire moved to Marlow, Buckinghamshire. At Marlow, they entertained friends, worked hard at their writing, and often discussed politics. Early in the summer of 1817, Mary Shelley finished Frankenstein, which was published anonymously in January 1818. She also began work on History of a Six Weeks' Tour, which was published in November 1817. Composition and publication Mont Blanc and the Mer de Glace glacier were focal points of the Shelleys' 1816 journey.In the summer of 1817, Mary Shelley started to assemble the couple's joint diary from their 1814 journey into a travel book. At what point she decided to include the letters from the 1816 Geneva trip and Percy Shelley's poem \\"Mont Blanc\\" is unclear, but by 28 September the journal and the letters were a single text. By the middle of October she was making fair copies for the press and correcting and transcribing Frankenstein for publication while Percy was working on The Revolt of Islam. Percy probably corrected and copyedited the journal section while Mary did the same for his letters. Advertisements for the work appeared on 30 October in the Morning Chronicle and on 1 November in The Times, promising a 6 November release. However, the work was not actually published until 12 and 13 November. It was Mary Shelley's first published work. History of a Six Weeks' Tour begins with a \\"Preface\\", written by Percy Shelley, followed by the journal section. The journal consists of edited entries from the joint diary that Percy and Mary Shelley kept during their 1814 trip to the Continent, specifically those from 28 July to 13 September 1814. Of the 8,500 words in the journal section, 1,150 are from Percy's entries and either copied verbatim or only slightly paraphrased. Almost all of the passages describing the sublime are in Percy's words. When Mary turned to her own entries, however, she significantly revised them; according to Jeanne Moskal, the editor of the recent definitive edition of the Tour, \\"almost nothing of her original phrasing remains\\". She even included sections of Claire Clairmont's journal. The second section of the text consists of four \\"Letters written during a Residence of Three Months in the Environs of Geneva, in the Summer of the Year 1816\\". The first two letters are signed \\"M\\" and the second two \\"S\\". The first two are attributed to Mary Shelley, but their origin is obscure. As Moskal writes, \\"the obvious inference is that they are literary versions of lost private epistles to Fanny Godwin\\", Mary Shelley's stepsister who remained in England and with whom she corresponded during the journey. However, Moskal also notes that there is a missing Mary Shelley notebook from precisely this time, from which the material in these letters could have come: \\"It is extremely likely that this notebook contained the same kind of mix of entries made by both Shelleys that the surviving first (July 1814 ‚Äì May 1815) and second (July 1816 ‚Äì June 1819) journal notebooks exhibit....Furthermore, Letter I contains four short passages found almost verbatim in P. B. Shelley's letter of 15 May to T. L. Peacock.\\" The third and fourth letters are composites of Mary's journal entry for 21 July and one of Percy's letters to Peacock. The third section of the text consists only of Percy's poem \\"Mont Blanc. Lines written in the vale of Chamouni\\"; it was the first and only publication of the poem in his lifetime. It has been argued by leading Percy Shelley scholar Donald Reiman that the History of a Six Weeks' Tour is arranged so as to lead up to \\"Mont Blanc\\". However, those who see the work as primarily a picturesque travel narrative argue that the descriptions of Alpine scenes would have been familiar to early nineteenth-century audiences and they would not have expected a poetic climax. In 1839, History of a Six Weeks' Tour was revised and republished as \\"Journal of a Six Weeks‚Äô Tour\\" and \\"Letters from Geneva\\" in Essays, Letters from Abroad, Translations and Fragments, by Percy Bysshe Shelley, Edited by Mrs. Shelley (1840). Although these works were not by her husband, she decided to include them because they were \\"part of his life\\", as she explained to her friend Leigh Hunt. She appended her initials to the works to indicate her authorship. As Moskal explains, \\"the unity of the 1817 volume as a volume was dissolved\\" to make way for a biography of Percy Shelley. After Percy Shelley drowned in 1822, his father forbade Mary Shelley from writing a memoir or biography of the poet. She therefore added significant biographical notices to the edited collections of his works. The 1840 version of History of a Six Weeks' Tour has four major types of changes according to Moskal: \\"(i) modernization and correction of spelling, punctuation and French (ii) self-distancing from the familial relationship with Claire Clairmont (iii) a heightened sensitivity to national identity (iv) presentation of the travelers as a writing, as well as reading, circle\\". As a result of these changes, more of Percy Shelley‚Äôs writing was included in the 1840 version than in the 1817 version. In 1845, Mary Shelley published a one- volume edition with additional minor changes, based on the 1840 version. Description The dotted line and red dots indicate towns visited on the 1814 European tour; the solid line and green dots indicate towns visited on the 1816 trip to Lake Geneva. History of a Six Weeks' Tour consists of three major sections: a journal, letters from Geneva, and the poem \\"Mont Blanc\\". It begins with a short preface, which claims \\"nothing can be more unpresuming than this little volume\\" and makes it clear that the couple in the narrative is married (although Mary and Percy were not at the time). The journal, which switches between the first-person singular and plural but never identifies its narrators, describes Percy, Mary, and Claire's 1814 six-week tour across the Continent. It is divided by country: France, Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands. After the group arrives in Calais and proceeds to Paris, they decide on a plan: \\"After talking over and rejecting many plans, we fixed on one eccentric enough, but which, from its romance, was very pleasing to us. In England we could not have put it in execution without sustaining continual insult and impertinence: the French are far more tolerant of the vagaries of their neighbours. We resolved to walk through France\\". Each day they enter a new town; but even while travelling, they spend time writing and reading. The journal comments on the people they meet, the countryside, and the current events that have shaped the environment. Some of what they see is beautiful and some is \\"barren and wretched\\". Percy sprains his ankle, which becomes an increasing problem‚Äîthe group is forced to hire a carriage. By the time the trio reaches Lucerne, they are nearly out of money and decide to return home. They return by boat along the Rhine, the cheapest mode of travel. Despite problems with unreliable boats and dangerous waters, they see some beautiful scenery before landing in England. The four \\"Letters from Geneva\\" cover the period between May and July 1816, which the Shelleys spent at Lake Geneva and switch between the singular and plural first-person. Letters I, II, and IV describe the sublime aspects of Mont Blanc, the Alps, Lake Geneva, and the glaciers around Chamonix: Letter III describes a tour around the environs of Vevey and other places associated with the Enlightenment philosopher Jean- Jacques Rousseau: \\"This journey has been on every account delightful, but most especially, because then I first knew the divine beauty of Rousseau's imagination, as it exhibits itself in Julie.\\" \\"Mont Blanc\\" compares the sublime aspect of the mountain to the human imagination: While emphasising the ability of the human imagination to uncover truth through a study of nature, the poem also questions religious certainty. However, according to the poem only a privileged few are able to see nature as it truly is and reveal its secrets to the world. Genre Mary Shelley wrote of the 1814 trip that \\"it was acting in a novel, being an incarnate romance\\". (Richard Rothwell, 1840) History of a Six Weeks‚Äô Tour is a travel narrative, part of a literary tradition begun in the seventeenth century. Through the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, Continental travel was considered educational: young, aristocratic gentlemen completed their studies by learning European languages abroad and visiting foreign courts. In the early seventeenth century, however, the emphasis shifted from classical learning to empirical experience, such as knowledge of topography, history, and culture. Detailed travel books, including personal travel narratives, began to be published and became popular in the eighteenth century: over 1,000 individual travel narratives and travel miscellanies were published between 1660 and 1800. The empiricism that was driving the scientific revolution spread to travel literature; for example, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu included information she learned in Turkey regarding smallpox inoculation in her travel letters. By 1742, critic and essayist Samuel Johnson was recommending that travellers engage in \\"a moral and ethical study of men and manners\\" in addition to a scientific study of topography and geography. Over the course of the eighteenth century, the Grand Tour became increasingly popular; travel to the Continent for Britain's elite was not only educational but also nationalistic. All aristocratic gentlemen took similar trips and visited similar sites, often devoted to developing an appreciation of Britain from abroad. The Grand Tour was celebrated as educational travel when it involved exchanging scientific information with the intellectual elite, learning about other cultures, and preparing oneself to lead. However, it was condemned as trivial when the tourist simply purchased curio collectibles, acquired a \\"superficial social polish\\", and pursued fleeting sexual relationships. During the Napoleonic Wars, the Continent was closed to British travellers and the Grand Tour came under increasing criticism, particularly from radicals such as William Godwin who scorned its aristocratic connections. Young Romantic writers criticised its lack of spontaneity; they celebrated Madame de Sta—ël's novel Corinne (1807), which depicts proper travel as \\"immediate, sensitive, and above all [an] enthusiastic experience\\". A new form of travel emerged‚ÄîRomantic travel‚Äîwhich focused on developing \\"taste\\", rather than acquiring objects, and having \\"enthusiastic experiences\\". History of a Six Weeks' Tour embodies this new style of travel. It is a specifically Romantic travel narrative because of its enthusiasm and the writers' desire to develop a sense of \\"taste\\". The travellers are open to new experiences, changing their itinerary frequently and using whatever vehicles they can find. For example, at one point in the journal, Mary Shelley muses: Not everything she encounters is beautiful, however, and she juxtaposes her distaste for the German working class with her delight with French servants. Although politically liberal, Mary Shelley is aesthetically repelled by the Germans and therefore excludes them. Unlike the non-discriminating Claire Clairmont, Shelley feels free to make judgments of the scenes around her; Shelley writes that Claire \\"on looking at this scene...exclaimed, 'Oh! this is beautiful enough; let us live here.' This was her exclamation on every new scene, and as each surpassed the one before, she cried, 'I am glad we did not stay at Charenton, but let us live here'\\". Shelley also compares herself positively to the French peasants who are unaware that Napoleon has been deposed. As scholar Angela Jones contends, \\"Shelley may be said to figure herself as a more knowledgeable, disinterested English outsider capable of rendering impartial judgment\\"‚Äîan Enlightenment value. However, as Romanticist Jacqueline Labbe argues, Mary Shelley challenges the conventions of the Romantic travel narrative as well. For example, one reviewer wrote, \\"now and then a French phrase drops sweetly enough from [the author's] fair mouth\\", and as Labbe explains, these phrases are supposed to lead the reader to imagine a \\"beautiful heroine and her group passing easily from village to village\\". However, both French quotations in History of a Six Weeks' Tour undercut this Romantic image. The first describes the overturning of a boat and the drowning of its occupants; the second is a warning not to travel on foot through France, as Napoleon's army has just been disbanded and the women are in danger of rape. While the overarching generic category for History of a Six Weeks' Tour is that of the travel narrative, its individual sections can be considered separately. The first journey is told as a \\"continuous, undated diary entry\\" while the second journey is told through epistolary and lyric forms. Moskal agrees with Reiman that the book was constructed to culminate in \\"Mont Blanc\\" and she notes that this was accomplished using a traditional hierarchy of genres‚Äîdiary, letters, poem‚Äîa hierarchy that is gendered as Mary Shelley's writings are superseded by Percy's. However, these traditional gender-genre associations are undercut by the implicit acknowledgment of Mary Shelley as the primary author, with her journal giving the entire work its name and contributing the bulk of the text. The group read Mary Wollstonecraft's Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark while on their 1814 tour, which subsequently influenced History of a Six Weeks' Tour. The journal is also threaded through with elements of the medieval and Gothic romance tradition: \\"accounts of ruined castles, enchanting valleys, and sublime views\\". In fact, in \\"The English in Italy\\", Mary Shelley writes of the journey that \\"it was acting in a novel, being an incarnate romance\\". However, these romantic descriptions are often ambiguous. Often single sentences contain juxtapositions between \\"romance\\" and \\"reality\\": \\"Many villages, ruined by war, occupied the most romantic spots\\". She also references Don Quixote, but he was \\"famous for his delusions of romance\\", as Labbe points out. Mary Shelley's allusions to Cervantes's Don Quixote (1605) not only places her text in a romance tradition, they would also have hinted at its radicalism to contemporary readers. During the 1790s, Mary Shelley's father, William Godwin, connected his support for the French Revolution with the romance tradition, specifically Don Quixote and any allusion to the novel would have signalled Godwinian radicalism to readers at the time. It would also have suggested support for reform efforts in Spain, which was rebelling against Napoleon. The beginning of the journal is dominated by romance conventions, but this style disappears when the travellers run out of money. However, romance conventions briefly return during the trip down the Rhine. As Labbe argues, \\"it would appear that while [Shelley] seems to be industriously salting her narrative with romance in order, perhaps, to garner public approval, she also ... exposes the falsity of such a scheme.\\" One of the most important influences on History of a Six Weeks' Tour was Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (1796), written by Mary Shelley's mother Mary Wollstonecraft. A travel narrative that reflects on topography, politics, society, aesthetics, and the author's personal feelings, it provided a model for Mary Shelley's work. Like her mother, Mary Shelley revealed her liberalism by boldly discussing politics; however, this political tone was unusual for travel works at the time and was considered inappropriate for women writers. Like Wollstonecraft's Letters, History of a Six Weeks' Tour blurs the line between private and public spheres by using intimate genres such as the journal and the letter, allowing Mary Shelley to present political opinions through personal anecdote and the picturesque. Themes Napoleon Crossing the Alps by Jacques-Louis David (1801‚Äì05) History of a Six Weeks' Tour is part of a liberal reaction to recent history: its trajectory begins with a survey of the devastation of the Napoleonic Wars and ends by celebrating the sublime in nature. William Wordsworth's 1850 The Prelude and the third canto of Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage follow a similar course. As Moskal explains, \\"nature is troped as the repository of a sublimity, once incarnated in Napoleon, that will re-emerge in politics\\". The book is therefore not only a liberal political statement but also a Romantic celebration of nature. The journal begins with, as Moskal describes, a \\"view of Napoleon's shattered political power\\". He had just been exiled to Elba a few months before the Shelleys arrived in Europe. Surveying the devastation caused by the Napoleonic Wars, Mary Shelley worries about how the British will handle Paris and grieves over the \\"ruin\\" brought to the small French town of Nogent by the Cossacks. Between the two journeys recorded in the text, Napoleon returned to power in the so-called Hundred Days and was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The four letters from Geneva reflect obliquely on this event. As Moskal argues, \\"the Shelleys focus on the forms of sublimity and power that outlast Napoleon: the literary genius of Rousseau and the natural sublimity of Lake Geneva and Mont Blanc\\". Both Shelleys use their works in History of a Six Weeks‚Äô Tour to assess and evaluate the French Revolution, making it a highly political travel narrative. In Letter II, Mary Shelley writes: Mary Shelley also includes positive portrayals of the French people. As Mary Shelley scholar Betty T. Bennett explains, \\"politically pointed, these accolades underscore the link between the 1814 defeated enemy of Britain and the pre- Napoleon democratic spirit of the 1789 Revolution, a spirit the Shelleys wished to reactivate\\". Lives of people interested Mary Shelley and she recorded them, but she also recorded a great deal of the travellers‚Äô own feelings, suggesting to the reader the appropriate reaction. For example, she wrote of the French town Nogent: Reception Comparing the liberal Lady Morgan to the writer of History of a Six Weeks' Tour, the Blackwood's Magazine reviewer favoured the writer of the Tour, apparently missing the liberal themes in Mary Shelley's writing. History of a Six Weeks' Tour received three major reviews, mostly favourable. However, the book did not sell well. Percy Shelley discovered in April or May 1820 that there were no profits to pay the printer and when Charles Ollier, the co-publisher, went out of business in 1823, his inventory included 92 copies of the work. Still, Mary Shelley believed the work was successful, and when she proposed another travel narrative, Rambles in Germany and Italy, to publisher Edward Moxon in 1843, she wrote \\"my 6 weeks tour brought me many compliments\\". Her comments may have been self-interested, however. The first review of History of a Six Weeks' Tour was published by The Eclectic Review in May 1818, which reviewed the book along with publisher Thomas Hookham's account of a Swiss tour, A Walk through Switzerland in September 1816. Although both works share the same fascination with Rousseau and his liberal ideas, only Hookham is attacked; as scholar Benjamin Colbert explains, \\"Shelley tends to remain on more neutral territory\\", such as the cult of sensibility and the novel Julie. However, the reviewer questions the authenticity of the work: \\"To us...the value of the book is considerably lessened by a strong suspicion that the dramatis personae are fictitious, and that the little adventures introduced for the purpose of giving life and interest to the narration, are the mere invention of the Author.\\" He identifies passages that remind him of similar travel narratives by Patrick Brydone, Ann Radcliffe, and John Carr, effectively identifying the generic tradition in which the Shelleys were writing. The second and most positive review was published by Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine in July 1818. The reviewer was most impressed with the journal section, particularly its informality and concision: \\"the perusal of it rather produces the same effect as a smart walk before breakfast, in company with a lively friend who hates long stories\\". Covertly comparing the work to bluestocking Lady Morgan's recent France (1817), the reviewer found the female writer of History of a Six Weeks' Tour much more favourable: \\"The writer of this little volume, too, is a Lady, and writes like one, with ease, gracefulness, and vivacity. Above all, there is something truly delightful in the colour of her stockings; they are of the purest white, and much more becoming than the brightest blue.\\" The Monthly Review published a short review in January 1819; they found the first journey \\"hurried\\" but the second one better described. For most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Mary Shelley was known as the author of Frankenstein and the wife of famous Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. It was not until the 1970s, with the rise of feminist literary criticism, that scholars began to pay attention to her other works. In fact, with the exception of Frankenstein and The Last Man, until the 1990s almost all of Mary Shelley's writings had gone out of print or only been available in expensive, scholarly editions. It was not until the publication of scholarship by Mary Poovey and Anne K. Mellor in the 1980s that Mary Shelley's \\"other\\" works‚Äîher short stories, essays, reviews, dramas, biographies, travel narratives, and other novels‚Äîbegan to be recognised as literary achievements.

Life Entering the Franciscan friary in his native town, he there made his preliminary studies, after which he studied philosophy at Drogheda. Subsequently, he left Ireland and studied theology at Salzburg and at the Franciscan college at the Catholic University of Louvain. At the latter place he was, immediately after his ordination, appointed professor of theology, and in that capacity maintained the reputation he had earned as a student. In 1653 Caron published at Antwerp a work Roma triumphans Septicollis, in defense of Catholic doctrine. Caron was sent to Ireland in 1648 by Friar Pierre Marchant, who was a Definitor General of the Order, as a Visitor to the Franciscan Province of Ireland, with ample powers to correct and reform. This was done at the suggestion of James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde. He took up residence at the Franciscan friary at Kilkenny, and plunged at once into the strife of faction then raging there. Opposing both the papal nuncio, Giovanni Battista Rinuccini, and Owen Roe O'Neill, he sought to bring all to the side of the Duke of Ormonde, and imprisoned the members of his own Order at Kilkenny who refused to adopt his views. This act made him so unpopular that his life was in danger, and he had to be protected by the Earl of Castlehaven at the head of an armed force. This conduct earned for him the character of a loyalist; but it brought on him the condemnation of Friar John Barnewall, OFM, the Minister Provincial of Ireland, together with the guardians of the various communities of friars on the island. For a time he was under ecclesiastical censure. During the rule of the Puritans Caron remained abroad, but returned to England at the Restoration of 1660, and lived there for several years. He was throughout the supporter of the Duke of Ormonde and his policy. He wrote two works, in defense of Friar Peter Walsh's History of the Irish Remonstrance, namely: Loyalty asserted, and the late Remonstrance of the Irish Clergy and Laity confirmed and proved by the authority of Scripture, Fathers, etc. (London, 1662); and Remonstrantia Hibernorum contra Lovanienses (London, 1665).

Early years Lawyer was born November 8, 1932, in Los Angeles, California. He attended the University of California, Berkeley and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1955. Career After graduating from college, Lawyer joined the U.S. Air Force and trained as a fighter pilot. He was a distinguished graduate of the Air Force Fighter Weapons School and served two combat tours during the Vietnam War. On his first tour early in the conflict, Lawyer served as a forward air controller directing air strikes against enemy troops. He served his second tour later in the war as an F-4 pilot and fought in Operation Linebacker. Lawyer became involved in flight test in 1958 when his squadron was selected to test the F-105B. He attended the Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School (now the USAF Test Pilot School) at Edwards AFB and graduated with Class 63A receiving the school's A.B. Honts Award as the outstanding member of his class for academic achievement and flying excellence. In 1965, Lawyer was selected as one of the first astronauts to the Air Force's classified Manned Orbital Laboratory. The MOL program, canceled in 1969 before sending any astronauts into space, was to man a military space station with Air Force astronauts using a modified Gemini spacecraft. Unable to transfer to NASA due to age restrictions, Lawyer did not achieve his goal of space flight, but continued flying for the Air Force. He retired from USAF service in 1982 as a Colonel.

The first suit was labeled 007, and the second had both a label, 008, and a name, \\"Lawyer\\". Investigators determined the second spacesuit was one used by Lawyer who had been assigned to evaluate spacesuits for the MOL program. The story of the recovered spacesuits and the history of the MOL program was presented in the Public Television series NOVA episode called Astrospies which aired February 12, 2008.

He matriculated at Burgersdorp High School and studied at Stellenbosch University (BA History and Dutch, cum laude, 1926 and MA History, cum laude, 1928). He continued his studies in history in Germany at the Friedrich Wilhelms Universit√§t in Berlin (1928‚Äì1929), at the Sorbonne in Paris (1930) and in Amsterdam, researching his doctoral thesis, which he completed on his return to Stellenbosch.

It starred several National Football League stars in the title roles. It was one of the first all-black biker films. Plot The plot involves an African American veteran of the Vietnam War, played by Gene Washington, who returns home to find that his brother (played by Robert Howard) has been killed. The killing was done by a white supremacist motorcycle gang, led by Ben \\"Thor\\" Davidson, who objected to the fact that Howard had been dating Thor's sister. Washington and his motorcycle gang, known as the Black Six, vow to avenge his brother's death. The Six encounter a number of obstacles, including hostile motorcycle gangs (particularly Thor's), and racist policemen. The movie climaxes with an inconclusive battle royal between the Six and Thor's Caucasian-supremacist biker gang, in which Thor (apparently) blows them and himself up by igniting the gas tank of his own motorcycle. The film concludes with the caption Honky, look out...Hassle a brother, and the Black 6 will return!. Cast The titular \\"Black Six\\" was played by six then-current National Football League stars: * Gene Washington, a wide receiver with the San Francisco 49ers * Joe Greene, a defensive tackle with the Pittsburgh Steelers * Mercury Morris, a running back with the Miami Dolphins * Lem Barney, a cornerback with the Detroit Lions * Willie Lanier, a linebacker with the Kansas City Chiefs * Carl Eller, a defensive end with the Minnesota Vikings The players' teams appeared with the actors' names in the film's credits. In addition, the cast includes Ben Davidson, who had recently retired from football, as a member of a motorcycle gang opposing the Black Six. Maury Wills, a recently retired Major League Baseball star, also has a role in the film. Washington was given the lead role due to him having previous acting experience; he and several other cast members (many of whom did more acting afterwards) later criticized how poorly the script had been written. All six protagonists (and Davidson) were All-Pro, while Greene, Barney, Lanier and Eller have since been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Production Filmed on location in Frazier Park, CA. Several of the football players were disappointed with elements in the original script, especially that the black motorcyclists would be killed in the end, despite the fact that they stood for truth, justice and the American way. As a result of their protests, an inconclusive ending was shot. DVD The Black Six was released on DVD on October 12, 2004.

The festival is dedicated to bring classic pop music to the public, and is run by CEO and founder David Bash and Rina Bardfield. Although the festival has over the years featured several major label acts, such as Phantom Planet, Maroon 5 (under their previous incarnation, Kara's Flowers), and The Click Five, Bash tries to maintain the grassroots feel of the festival by featuring primarily unsigned bands, and presenting them in a festival platform with similar minded artists. Conception and evolution of the festival The International Pop Overthrow Music Festival was created in December 1997. The name was chosen to pay tribute to Jim Ellison, singer songwriter of Material Issue, a power pop band from Chicago, whose 1991 debut album was entitled International Pop Overthrow. In August 1998, the first International Pop Overthrow festival was held in Los Angeles, featuring 120 pop and rock bands from Los Angeles, several other US cities, and 10 bands from five countries: Canada, Australia, Sweden, France, and the Netherlands. Over the next three years, its roster grew to include bands from countries such as Japan, Norway, Austria, Israel, and the United Kingdom. At the 2001 festival, during a panel discussion, it was suggested by several bands that Bash take International Pop Overthrow on the road. The first city outside Los Angeles in which the International Pop Overthrow Festival (IPO) was held was New York, in December 2001, followed by Chicago in April 2002. The festival became international in 2003, when Bash was approached by Beatles historian, Jean Catharell, to hold the festival in Liverpool, UK. The festival has since become a yearly event at the Cavern Club, drawing unsigned pop and rock talent from around the world. The festival is now held annually in 16 different cities, and Bash continues to explore opportunities to take the festival to additional locales, with Spain, Japan, and Australia high on the list of possible future International Pop Overthrow locations. The International Pop Overthrow Festival has been held in several venues, such as the Cavern Club (Liverpool UK), the Troubadour (Los Angeles), the El Rey (Los Angeles), Spaceland (Los Angeles), the Abbey (Chicago), Schubas (Chicago), Bottom of the Hill (San Francisco), The Rivoli (Toronto), the Khyber (Philadelphia), Arlene's Grocery (New York), Kenny's Castaways (New York), the Knitting Factory (Los Angeles and New York), the Middle East (Boston), the Railway (Vancouver BC), City Hall (Denver), and the Orange County Fair (Orange County CA). The International Pop Overthrow festival has been recognized in an interactive exhibit at The Grammy Museum, as helping the power pop genre \\"persist into the new millenium.\\" Artists who have played the International Pop Overthrow Festival include Walter Egan, Harmony Grass, Shoes, Off Broadway, John Wicks & The Records, The Rubinoos, The Cowsills, and Enuff Z'Nuff, as well as recent and current stars, such as Kara's Flowers (now known as Maroon 5), Phantom Planet, The Click Five, Jason Falkner, Seth Swirsky and The 88. The International Pop Overthrow Festival has been covered in numerous publications, including The Los Angeles Times, L.A. Weekly, The Chicago Sun Times, The Boston Herald, The Boston Globe, New York Magazine, The New Yorker, The Liverpool Echo, BBC Liverpool, SPIN!, Goldmine, Amplifier, and Billboard. In addition, Bash has been featured in a Sonicbids promoter profile, and noted Liverpool historian and BBC radio personality, Spencer Leigh, devoted several pages to the festival in his book, The Cavern: The Most Famous Club in the World. From 1997 to 2010, Not Lame Recordings released an annual CD compilation featuring bands that have played in any of the cities which the festival has appeared. After Not Lame shut down, the website Pop Geek Heaven has continued releasing annual compilations of each year's participants.

It developed from the private collection of the late Jim MacDonald from St Margaret's Hope and marks the importance of wireless communications in Orkney during World War II. Orkney Wireless Museum Museum The Orkney Wireless Museum is located at Kiln Corner, Kirkwall in Orkney and is run on an entirely voluntary basis. It is registered as a Charitable Company. The Friends of the museum, from all over the world, help raise funds for the museum. The local branch of the society organises volunteers to man the Museum every day of the season, from April to September. The displays and photographic archive bear testament to the strategic and military importance of Orkney during World War II. In the collection there is much reference to the Home Fleet in Scapa Flow, Orkney. The museum demonstrates the importance of wireless communications and Radar to the civilian and military populations. The Amateur Radio call sign GB2OWM is frequently activated at the museum. During the Orkney Science Festival every September, worldwide contacts are made and QSL cards are subsequently exchanged with the stations contacted. Exhibits Ardent hearing aid The museum has an extensive collection of early domestic radio and wartime communications equipment. Most of the equipment was built in the UK and US. The museum also houses early advertising and posters. An archive of photographs depicts wartime forces and includes coverage of the building of the Churchill Barriers which were built primarily as naval defences to protect the anchorage at Scapa Flow. Some examples of exhibits: * No. 19 Tank Set * early recording equipment e.g. The Recordon dictating machine made by Thermionic Products Ltd of England ‚Äì features a flat, magnetically coated paper disk. * example of 1930s Ardent hearing aid * a working crystal set (made about 1912) with the crystal/cat's whisker detector clearly visible.

Museum history Jim MacDonald had a love of wireless sets and gathered an extensive and varied collection of domestic and military wireless equipment. The Museum was founded in 1983 when he was persuaded to display his collection in what he called \\"An Orkney Wireless Museum\\" in the family home in St Margaret's Hope, South Ronaldsay. After he died of cancer in 1988, his family carried out his wishes to develop the museum. In June 1990 a registered family Trust was set up to run the museum. In 1994, the Museum was admitted as a member of the Museums and Galleries Commission of Great Britain. The Museum was awarded a Certificate from the Royal Naval Amateur Radio Society \\"For work in collecting, preserving and displaying the radio and electronic heritage of Scapa Flow and the Orkney Isles\\" In 1997, the collection moved to Kiln Corner, Kirkwall which allowed a greater number of exhibits to be displayed. The Museum has received many financial donations. Founder James \\"Jim\\" MacDonald (1927‚Äì1988) was born and brought up on South Ronaldsay. He was locally educated and served his apprenticeship as an electrician and radio repairman. During his boyhood, wireless was rapidly developing and he started to gather old, interesting sets which were becoming redundant. This became the nucleus for his collection which includes such rare and interesting examples as \\"Kit Sets\\" and the very, very expensive models by such famous names as Marconi, Cossor, MacMichael, K.B., Lowe and Amplion. With the outbreak of war in 1939, he was listed as in a reserved occupation, and worked for the War Office as a civilian in the great Naval Base at Lyness. He was also employed at other RAF sites such as Netherbutton, with one of the world's first active operational Radar installations. (This was actually the prototype, modified, which was shipped from England, as the one being built for Orkney was not nearly ready. When Orkney's was finished, it was sent to Dover where it was to play such a vital role in the Battle of Britain). After the war, Jim collected as many examples of relevant equipment as he could; many operations were still classified as Top Secret. Another problem to collection was that equipment was deliberately destroyed in order to prevent flooding the market with surplus goods (as had happened after the First World War). The collected equipment had played a vital part in the Battle of the Atlantic and North Sea, and has all seen active service.

The light station was first established in 1848 and was destroyed in 1861 during the Civil War. It was rebuilt after the war and the lights were in existence at least as late as 1901. Neither of the range lights still remains today.Clary, Margie Willis, The Beacons of South Carolina, Sandlapper Publishing Co., Inc., Orangeburg, SC, 2005, pp. 92-93, .Zepke, Terrance, Lighthouse of the Carolinas, Pineapple Press, Sarasota, FL, 2002, pp. 121-126, . Sullivan's Island is a barrier island at the northern entrance to the Charleston harbor. The entire island is now the Town of Sullivan's Island. It is the location of Fort Moultrie and the current Charleston Light. History The station was established in 1848 to guide ships over the Charleston Bar and was destroyed during the war in 1861. After the surrender of Confederate forces in Charleston, a temporary beacon was placed in a skeletal tower on the roof of a private house. This light guided ships through the channel near the wreck of the ironclad USS Weehawken and also a lightship was placed over the wreck. Range lights were then placed in Fort Moultrie in 1872, with the front beacon rested on the fort's parapet and the lightship was removed. The station also included keeper's quarters. In 1878 the front beacon was moved from the parapet to the glacis of the fort. In 1879 it was raised and placed upon a brick room that served as an oil room. It was surrounded by a white picket fence. In 1883, it was painted red. In 1886, the front beacon was moved to the west. In 1899, the rear range light was discontinued and replaced by two front range lights. On May 20, 1899 it was renamed as the \\"South Channel Range\\" lights. In 1901, the Front Light was about southeast of the southeastern angle of Fort Moultrie, and the other light was about to the east of the Front light. The lights were eventually removed at an unknown date.

The property is also known as The Katharine Hepburn Cultural Arts Center and Theatre. The 260-seat theater had the blessing of the Hepburn Estate and the actress's family. Cynthia McFadden of ABC News, an executor of the Hepburn Estate, was an honorary capital campaign committee member. Hepburn's brother-in-law, Ellsworth Grant, was instrumental in helping the Board of Trustees honor the actress with his knowledge of Hepburn and her family. Grant was an author and former Mayor of West Hartford, Connecticut. Former Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell said the following about the Katharine Hepburn Cultural Arts Center: \\"It is my pleasure to recognize that one of Connecticut's own is being honored in the naming of an historic building that will perpetuate her legacy. Katharine Hepburn contributed much in her long career in film and theater, not only to Connecticut, but throughout the world. To remember her in this manner is most fitting and I salute the efforts of all those involved.\\" Connecticut U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd had also recognized the theater in saying: \\"I commend everyone participating in this grand effort to restore the old Town Hall building in Old Saybrook to create in its place the Katharine Hepburn Cultural Arts Center, I'm honored that I can lend my name in support of what will be a meaningful and inspiring tribute to our Connecticut treasure, Katharine Hepburn.\\" The building was designed by New London architect James Sweeney, and \\"is a fine example of the Colonial Revival Style.\\" The general contractor was William L. Roe, Jr., of New London. and  The Spirit of Katharine Hepburn Award  The Spirit of Katharine Hepburn Award is given by the Kate to an individual who embodies the spirit, independence, and character of the legendary actress. It is presented annually at the summer Gala, the Kate's largest fund raising event. The award is a graceful bronze statuette in the likeness of Ms. Hepburn by Kimberly Monson, an artist and faculty member of the Lyme Academy of Fine Arts.  2019 - Christine Baranski  One of the entertainment industry‚Äôs most honored actresses, Christine Baranski is an Emmy, two-time Tony, Screen Actors Guild, Drama Desk and American Comedy Award winner. A graduate of the Juilliard School, Baranski received her big break in Tom Stoppard‚Äôs hit Broadway comedy ‚ÄúThe Real Thing,‚Äù directed by Mike Nichols, for which she won a Tony Award and Drama Desk Award. Ms. Baranski went on to earn a second Tony Award for her performance in Neil Simon‚Äôs ‚ÄúRumors.‚Äù She also won an Emmy, American Comedy and SAG Award for her role in the hit series ‚ÄúCybill,‚Äù in addition to three subsequent Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. She received a total of 5 Emmy nominations for her guest roles on ‚ÄúFrasier‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Big Bang Theory.‚Äù As the formidable ‚ÄúDian Lockhart,‚Äù Ms. Baranski received six Emmy nominations and two Critics‚Äô Choice Television Award nominations on CBS‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Good Wife.‚Äù She currently stars as the character in the critically acclaimed spin-off ‚ÄúThe Good Fight‚Äù on CBS All Access. As a young intern at the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, CT, Ms. Barnaski was inspired by Ms. Hepburn‚Äôs portrayal of Rosalind in ‚ÄúAs You Like It.‚Äù  2018 - Ann Nyberg  A resident of Madison, Ann Nyberg is WTNH-TV‚Äôs longest-serving anchor/reporter in station history and has been nominated for multiple Emmys. In addition to anchoring several evening newscasts, she also produces and hosts the show ‚ÄúNyberg,‚Äù an on-air and online show she developed to get people‚Äôs stories out to the masses. In November of 2015, Ann was inducted into the prestigious Silver Circle of the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (NATAS) Boston/New England Chapter - an honor given to television professionals who have made significant contributions to their community and to the vitality of the television industry. In 2017, Ann was recognized, during the year of Harper's Bazaar Magazine's 150th anniversary, as a woman of success who pays it forward. Ann has been a storyteller her entire life, which all started with a diary her mother gave her for Christmas when she was just 8 years old, and the rest is history. As she says, ‚ÄúI never met a story I didn‚Äôt want to tell.‚Äù Her first book, \\"Slices of Life, A Storyteller's Diary\\" debuted in October 2015, and is based on her diary. Her second book, released October 2016, is on the legendary Connecticut film actress, Katharine Hepburn. It is called \\"Remembering Katharine Hepburn: Stories of Wit and Wisdom About America's Leading Lady.\\"  2017 - Glenn Close  Glenn Close is a seven-time Academy Awards nominee and winner of three Tony Awards and three Emmys. She made her feature film debut in The World According to Garp, for which she received an Oscar nomination. She was subsequently Oscar-nominated for The Big Chill, The Natural, Fatal Attraction, Dangerous Liaisons, Albert Nobbs, and most recently, The Wife. Ms. Close won two consecutive Emmys along with a Golden Globe Award, and three SAG nominations for her portrayal of ‚ÄòPatty Hewes‚Äô on Damages. She won a third Emmy for her title role performance in Serving in Silence: the Margarethe Cammermeyer Story (for which she also received a Peabody Award as executive producer). In 1974, Close made her professional, theatre, and Broadway debut in The Phoenix Theatre‚Äôs Love for Love, directed by Harold Prince. Over her forty-three year career, she has always returned to the theater, receiving Tony Awards for Death and the Maiden, The Real Thing and Andrew Lloyd Webber‚Äôs musical Sunset Boulevard, as well as an Obie Award for The Singular Life of Albert Nobbs. Last spring, Close made her London-West End debut in a new production of Sunset Boulevard, for which she won a London Evening Standard Award and was nominated for an Olivier Award. She is presently starring, to great acclaim, in that same production, on Broadway. Ms. Close‚Äôs decision to continue in the acting profession in part stems from viewing one of the most famous and first ever television interviews with Katharine Hepburn conducted by Dick Cavett in 1973. Ms. Hepburn became an inspiration to Ms. Close and welcomed this role, finding small ways to support Ms. Close through communications and appearances at events honoring Ms. Close.  2016 - Dick Cavett  Mr. Cavett has lead a life of insight and humor, and is arguably best known for his self-named talk show ‚ÄòThe Dick Cavett Show‚Äô and his remarkable ability for in-depth and sophisticated interviews and conversation. His television show boasts one of the most famous interviews with Katharine Hepburn, who rarely agreed to interviews. ‚ÄúOne of the facts of life of doing a talk show is that some of the most interesting people in the world won‚Äôt do them. One of them is Katharine Hepburn,‚Äù Mr. Cavett said at the opening of his now famous two-part interview with Ms. Hepburn in 1973 on The Dick Cavett Show. ‚ÄúShe has spent most of her life avoiding the press and I wish I had a nickel for every time someone has said, ‚ÄòWouldn‚Äôt it be wonderful just to sit and listen to that woman talk?‚Äô Well, one afternoon recently, never having been on television, she agreed to come into my studio for a test only to check things out to see how it looked and felt. She checked the cameras, the lights, these chairs, the temperature in the studio, she pronounced the carpet ugly and then she surprised me by suddenly saying, ‚ÄòWhy don‚Äôt we just go ahead and do it now?‚Äô And we did.‚Äù  See also  *National Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County, Connecticut ReferencesExternal links *Official web site & blog Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Connecticut Category:Theatres in Connecticut Category:Old Saybrook, Connecticut Category:Buildings and structures in Middlesex County, Connecticut Category:Tourist attractions in Middlesex County, Connecticut Category:Katharine Hepburn Category:National Register of Historic Places in Middlesex County, Connecticut Category:Theatres on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:City and town halls on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut ","title":"Katharine Hepburn Cultural Arts Center"},{"id":"18704284","text":"John Bond (1550 ‚Äì 3 August 1612) was an English physician and classical scholar who also served twice as Member of Parliament (MP) for Taunton. Born at Trull in Somerset and educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford, he became a Master of Arts in 1579 and soon afterwards was appointed Master of the Free School at Taunton (an appointment in the gift of New College). Although unqualified in medicine, he also began to practise as a doctor, and became highly respected as a physician. He came to be more noted, however, for the commentaries he published on classical literature, notably that on Horace which subsequently were included in many European editions of the poet's works; also important was his Commentaries on Persius, published after his death by his son-in-law. Bond was elected MP for Taunton in the parliaments of 1601 and 1604‚Äì1611, and it is considered likely also that he was the John Bond who was chief secretary to the Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas Egerton. He died in 1612 and was buried in Taunton parish church.

The term was apparently coined by McQuown (1942), but suggestions for historical relationships relevant to this hypothesis can be traced back to the Squier (1861), who offered comparisons between Mayan and Mixe-Zoquean languages, and Radin (1916, 1919, 1924), who did the same for Mixe-Zoquean, Huave, and Mayan. History of proposals McQuown (1942, 1956) defined Macro-Mayan as the hypothetical ancestor of Mayan, Mije-Sokean, and Totonacan, further promoting the hypothesis. However, his hypothesis relied on the presence of \\"a glottalized series\\" of consonants in both Mayan and Totonakan. Such a trait could have potentially spread through contact. McQuown also admitted that ‚Äúthe relatively small number of coincidences in vocabulary indicates to us that this kinship is quite distant‚Äù (McQuown 1942:37-38). The hypothesis was not elaborated until 1979 when Brown and Witkowski put forth a proposal with 62 cognate sets and supposed sound correspondences between the two families. They also published two articles proposing a \\"Mesoamerican Phylum\\" composed of Macro- Mayan and other language families of Mesoamerica. This proposal was examined closely by Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman who rejected the proposal because of serious flaws in the methodology that had been applied. They rejected almost all of the 62 cognates. First and foremost they found it important to identify all cases of linguistic diffusion before collecting possible cognates because diffusion has been widespread within the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area. The exchanges between Brown and Witkowski and Campbell and Kaufman took place in the journal American Anthropologist between 1978 and 1983. In the late 1990s, Campbell (1997) expressed that he believed that Mayan would indeed some day prove to be related to Mixe‚ÄìZoquean and Totonacan, but that previous studies have not proven sufficient. Nevertheless, since then, Brown et al. (2011) have presented arguments in favor of a Totozoquean, a common ancestor between Totonacan and Mixe-Zoquean. Moreover, Mora-Mar√≠n (2014, 2016) constitutes the most recent attempt to test the relationship between Mayan and Mixe-Zoquean. He proposes the existence of regular sound correspondences among lexical and grammatical comparanda between the two. By transitivity, these two proposals would connect all three language families, rekindling the Macro-Mayan hypothesis as framed by McQuown. In Campbell's opinion, previous efforts to link Huave to Mayan, Mixe-Zoquean, Totonacan, or for that matter, any other language or family, has proven unfruitful, and \\"should thus be considered an isolate\\" (1997:161).

Abdelaziz Bouteflika was elected with 73.8% of the vote after the other six candidates withdrew on the eve of the elections. Background Incumbent president Liamine Z√©roual announced in September 1998 that early presidential elections would be held in February 1999. He also said that he would not be a candidate, in a move which was reported as being due to infighting within the Algerian army. The election date was later set for 15 April and the official campaign began on 25 March. The government set up the Independent National Commission for Monitoring the Presidential Election (CNISEP) to oversee the elections, and Z√©roual called upon all government officials to remain neutral. The elections took place amidst a backdrop of continuing conflict in the Algerian Civil War. Restoring peace to the country was the major election issue. Candidates The frontrunner was former foreign minister, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who was supported by much of the military and establishment. Bouteflika had the backing of the two main parties in the governing coalition and said that he would work to increase trust in the government and would not rule out talking to anyone. Pro-government newspapers described Bouteflika as the \\"national consensus candidate\\". The other candidates included Ahmed Taleb Ibrahimi, a former education and foreign minister, who received backing from the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). He supported talking with the FIS and for the military to withdraw from politics. Another candidate Abdallah Djaballah, the founder of the Movement for National Reform, called for a government of national unity to be formed. Two former prime ministers were candidates. Mouloud Hamrouche, prime minister from 1989 to 1991 was a former member of the governing National Liberation Front (FLN) who had fallen out with the leaders of the party. Mokdad Sifi was prime minister from 1993 to 1995 and was backed by part of the National Rally for Democracy (RND) which did not support Bouteflika. He opposed an amnesty or negotiations with murderers of women and children. Youcef Khatib was an independent candidate and former advisor to Z√©roual's 1995 election campaign. Hocine A√Øt Ahmed, the founder of the Socialist Forces Front, campaigned by calling for Algeria to be neither a military dictatorship or Islamic fundamentalist state. Near the end of the campaign Ahmed had a heart attack and had to go to Switzerland for treatment. Mass withdrawal Fewer than 24 hours before the elections, all candidates except Bouteflika withdrew, claiming the vote would not be fair. The candidates claimed that electoral fraud by the army ensured that Bouteflika would win the election, and that voter lists were being padded and extra ballot papers being printed to support Bouteflika. Z√©roual refused to meet the candidates to discuss their grievances and criticised them for withdrawing, describing the move as illegal. Results Official figures showed turnout to be 61% with Bouteflika winning easily. However, the other candidates claimed that turnout was much lower, with Ibrahimi estimating it had only been around 25%.

They then purchased and modernised a former 1935 Baptist church building and moved in 2006 to the Chinbrook and the former Chinbrook Meadows areas of Grove Park. The church was part of the Assemblies of God in Great Britain, a leading Pentecostal denomination worldwide. The church had a number of branches in the UK and in several nations worldwide. History of the building David Pinkess (Fred Pinkess' son), near the foundation stone of the church When the Grove Park Estate was first built in the 1920s, Lewisham Council determined that it should also include a church. Mr Frederick E Pinkess who had been running a successful ‚Äòmobile‚Äô Sunday school in the community decided to apply for permission to get a church built. He could clearly see that the area had potential for a thriving parish. With the help of the Shaftesbury Society, which was affiliated to the Baptist Church, Mr Pinkess raised enough money to build a church which was completed in May 1935. It was a non-denominational place of worship called Grove Park Mission and served as a mercy ministry to the poor.Detailed history according to the late Pastor Gordon Thomson (interviewed in 2007) In the 1930s and 1940s, the church had a very popular and effective outreach programme in the community especially amongst the children, which led to a thriving Sunday school. Outreaches included opening-air singing and playing hymns along the local residential streets while carrying around the heavy church organ for music. There were regular open air outreaches every Sunday afternoon and evening for many years.Detailed history given during a visit by David Pinkess (son of Fred Pinkess) and Adrian Pinkess (grandson of Fred Pinkess) on 11 April 2012 In 1947, the work was connected with the Free Church movement which was of the Plymouth Brethren movement. Then from 1961, Pastor Gordon Thomson who was connected to Honor Oak Christian Fellowship became the long-term pastor of the congregation now called The Christian Fellowship. A local branch of Operation Mobilisation was also instrumental in helping with this work.Detailed history according to the late Pastor Gordon Thomson (interviewed in 2007) In 1987, Book Aid began to lease space in the building from The Christian Fellowship, and then in August 2005 the building was sold to Jubilee International Church who had migrated from the Clapham area. Pastor Thomson expressed the fact that they were thankful to see the church building in the hands of a new thriving congregation. He and his wife both died within a month of each other in 2007.  Opposition  The new church came into the media spotlight in the summer of 2006 following serious controversy with local residents in Grove Park and heated dialogues with the local council, London Borough of Lewisham regarding planning consent. Following a favourable decision by the council regarding planning usage, this issue eventually culminated in racist arson attacks against the church and continuing minor attacks and opposition for almost two years. The proverbial dust settled after about 18 months.  References  External links  * JIC website * Assemblies of God in Great Britain * Anger at Council's U-turn on church.

It was built in Crow Wing County on the Cuyuna Iron Range in sections 23 and 28 of Wolford Township, about north of Trommald, Minnesota. After its formal dissolution, Manganese was absorbed by Wolford Township; the former town site is located between Coles Lake and Flynn Lake. First appearing in the U.S. Census of 1920 with an already dwindling population of 183, the village was abandoned by 1960. Manganese was one of the last of the Cuyuna Range communities to be established, and named after the mineral located in abundance near the town. Manganese was an incorporated community, built on land above the Trommald formation, the main ore-producing unit of the North Range district of the Cuyuna Iron Range, unique due to the amount of manganese in part of the of iron formation and ore. The Trommald formation and adjacent Emily district are the largest resource of manganese in the United States. The community was composed of many immigrants who had fled the various natural disasters, and the social and political upheavals in Europe during the late 19th and early 20th centuries before the onset of World War I. Manganese was laid out with three north‚Äìsouth and five east‚Äìwest streets. Concrete sidewalks and curbing lined the clay streets, which were never paved. At its peak around 1919, Manganese had two hotels, a bank, two grocery stores, a barbershop, a show hall, and a two-room school, and housed a population of nearly 600. After the end of World War I, the population of Manganese went into steady decline as mining operations shut down; along with the quagmire of the clay streets resulting from the spring rains, this led to the community's eventual abandonment and formal dissolution in 1961. The privately owned land started to undergo a limited resettlement in 2017, as the old wooded lots were being cleared and redeveloped as primitive campsites. History The area around Manganese, and modern-day Crow Wing County, was initially inhabited by three distinct populations of Native Americans vying for control of the lands that would become the Cuyuna Range. The Arapaho living along the western border of the Great Lakes were quickly displaced by the Dakota and Ojibwe nations; frequent conflicts between the Dakota and Ojibwe eventually resulted in undisputed control of the region by the Ojibwe. In 1855, a treaty between the Ojibwe and the U.S. Government, signed by chief Hole in the Day in what was then Minnesota Territory, secured Ojibwe hunting and fishing rights while ceding land which would become the Cuyuna Range to European-Americans looking to build new settlements in the region. The Minnesota Territorial Legislature enacted the creation of Crow Wing County on May 23, 1857. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858, and Deerwood (originally named Withington), was the first Cuyuna Range community, settled in 1882. The discovery of the Cuyuna Iron Range was an accident, made by the chance observation of a compass needle irregularity while surveyor and mining engineer Cuyler Adams was exploring the area with his St. Bernard, named \\"Una\\". Adams surmised that a large, underground body of iron ore might be responsible for the discrepancy. Nearly fifteen years after meticulously mapping these compass deflections, test drilling by Adams in May 1903 resulted in the discovery of manganiferous ore near Deerwood. Thirteen years after ore discovery by the Merritt Brothers in 1890 trigged an iron rush to the Mesabi Range, another iron rush began in Minnesota, and new mining communities began to develop along the width and breadth of the \\"Cuyuna\\" Iron Range, named by combining the first syllable of Adams' given name and the name of his dog. Establishment and community Manganese was platted in sections 23 and 28 of Wolford Township by the Duluth Land and Timber Company on February 5, 1911, established on March 13, 1912, and incorporated on November 10, 1913, with inside the corporate limits. As a result of the rapid mining development, all of the lots were sold within seven weeks of platting for $100 to $350 each. Manganese was named for the mineral located in abundance nearby. The mines surrounding the community included the Algoma mine, owned by the Onaham Iron Company and founded in 1911; the Gloria and Merrit No. 2 mines, both owned by the Hanna Mining Company and founded in 1916; the Milford mine, owned by the Cuyuna-Minneapolis Iron Company and founded in 1917, and the Preston mine, owned by Coates and Tweed and founded in 1918. The sixth of the Cuyuna Range communities to be established (after Deerwood, Cuyuna, Crosby, Ironton, and Riverton), the new town was touted as the \\"Hibbing of the Cuyuna Range\\". An official U.S. Post Office opened in 1912 and remained in operation through 1924. In 1914, the town site had a crew of men and teams building streets with concrete sidewalks and curbing (although the clay roads were never paved). The Fitger Brewing Company also built a $10,000, two-story hotel in 1914, complete with a bar and restaurant. By 1919, Manganese had two hotels, a bank, two grocery stores, two butcher shops, a lumber yard, a bakery, a livery stable, a barbershop, a pool room, a show hall, a dog pound, and a two-room school, and housed a population of nearly 600. That same year, the village issued a bond for a $30,000 waterworks project, and the Pastoret Company of Duluth built a water tower with a capacity. Manganese and other Cuyuna Range communities benefited greatly from an unusual situation created by an ad valorem property tax on unmined natural ore, resulting in huge amounts of unforeseen revenue, great expenditures of which were made on public works and improvements. School teacher Anna Dugan with the Manganese Soo Line depot in background After the discovery of ore near Deerwood, Adams approached James J. Hill, then president of the Northern Pacific Railway, asking for a discounted rate to haul Cuyuna Range ore to Duluth (the rate from the Mesabi Range, which had richer ore, was one dollar per ton). Hill refused, so Adams went to Thomas Shaughnessy, president of the Canadian Pacific Railway and a competitor of Hill, who readily agreed to build 100 miles of railroad with the guarantee to haul ten million tons of ore at sixty-five cents per ton. At the time, the Canadian Pacific controlled the Soo Line Railroad, having secured the railroad's funded debt, and the Soo Line came to furnish rail transportation to Manganese and the surrounding mines. In 1914, the Soo Line Railroad constructed a siding and began excavation for a passenger and freight depot with a platform. Passenger connections with the other Cuyuna Iron Range towns were available three times daily through the operation of buses owned by the Cuyuna Range Transportation Company. It was speculated that Henry Ford once visited Manganese when he was exploring the acquisition of the Algoma mine on behalf of the Ford Motor Company. Ford was never observed, but his private rail car, the Fair Lane, with the familiar Ford oval and the gilded words \\"Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan\\", was seen parked on the Manganese siding. The community was composed of many immigrants, including Finns, Croatians, Austrians, Swedes, Irish, Australians, English, Norwegians, Germans, Polish, Slovenians, Hungarians, Serbs, and French. Children attended school in Manganese through the eighth grade, attending high school in nearby Crosby, Minnesota. Known then as Independent School District No. 86, the school had indoor plumbing and later its own well, constructed by the Works Progress Administration. Over time, the village of Manganese had three wells, all of which collapsed at some point due to the heavy clay soils. During late World War I, all of the mines surrounding the community were running at full capacity, furnishing about 90% of the manganese used during the war. By 1920, the combined payrolls of these mines totaled $160,000. Seven citizens from Manganese served in the military during World War I, including Harry Hosford, who later survived the Milford mine disaster. Many of Manganese's residents worked in the Milford mine, which flooded on February 5, 1924, a result of blasting in a drift that extended beneath Foley Lake. Forty-one miners were killed in what was Minnesota's worst mining disaster; only seven, including Hosford, made it to safety. Many Manganese residents were superstitious and convinced that both the town of Manganese, and the Milford mine, were cursed. The Iver M. Olson home, first residence in Manganese; by the late 1950s, all the houses in town would be gone After the World War I armistice was signed, the demand for manganiferous ore decreased. With the advent of the Great Depression, mining operations ceased. The Soo Line tore up the track to Manganese in 1930. Little employment was left in the community, and residents relocated to find new jobs. The last shipment of ore from the Algoma and Gloria mines occurred in 1931; the Milford mine closed in 1932, although the Merritt mine continued to produce ore intermittently until 1943. Very few photos of Manganese are known to exist. Never a wealthy community, residents had no money for cameras, a luxury item during the Depression. In 1938, a Wesleyan Methodist Church and Sunday school was founded. Up to four Sunday school classes were offered depending on the ages of the children, and guest pastors would come to conduct services when occasional revival meetings were held. The congregation came from Trommald, Mission, Wolford, and Perry Lake, in addition to Manganese. The church was sold and torn down after World War II when the congregation was no longer able to appoint a pastor. As mining operations began to shut down, residents gradually started moving their homes out of town for relocation to other communities in the region. Abandonment and later use Most of the remaining residents moved out around 1955. Structures that were not moved out of the community were torn down. After all of the residents left, the clay roads continued to be maintained, and the street lights remained on for at least a decade. In 1959, the village of Ironton, one of the creditors for the village of Manganese, petitioned Crow Wing County for the community's dissolution. Einer R. Andersen, then Crow Wing County Auditor, was appointed as its receiver, and creditors of the village of Manganese were given six months to file a claim. Notices sent to the last known village officers were refused. Bids were accepted for the sale of the Manganese water tower and the frame building that had housed the village hall, with the condition that all debris be disposed of at the expense of the buyer. The steel water tower, with an estimated weight of of scrap metal, was valued at $1,200; however, the sale and salvage of the water tower yielded net proceeds of only $200. Ironically, the surviving Cuyuna Iron Range municipally-owned elevated metal water tanks (in the towns of Crosby, Cuyuna, Deerwood, Ironton, and Trommald) were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The final hearing regarding the dissolution of Manganese was held on July 17, 1961. Manganese was formally dissolved and absorbed by Wolford Township. Aerial photo of Manganese in 1939, before its abandonment After the town was abandoned, only remnants of sidewalks, rubble, building foundations, old tires, plastic, pieces of clothing, beer cans, and other abandoned items remained. The site was slowly overgrown with willow, aspen, and other trees; roots, shrubs, and grass began to heave and crack the concrete sidewalks and overtake the remaining grid pattern of roads. Most of the remaining structures succumbed to the elements. Old building foundations and basements, covered with graffiti, were engulfed by the brush. Trees covered what was once a land occupied by numerous buildings, and the entire town site was consumed by the steady growth of natural vegetation. In 2003, the majority of the land which comprised the former town site was purchased, and a gate was posted along with a \\"no trespassing\\" sign at the southeast entrance to the former town. In 2006, the privately owned land was sold again and began to undergo a limited resettlement in 2017. Called Manganese Base Camp, the old wooded lots, about each, were being cleared and redeveloped as primitive campsites, without electricity, running water, or waste disposal services. Since then, Base Camp has hosted an annual Manganese Days Festival. The event is open to the public as a way to honor the former village, learn of its history, and explore the old town. Geology Stratigraphy of the main units of the North Range district of the Cuyuna Iron Range Manganese lay atop the iron-rich Trommald formation, the main ore-producing unit of the North Range district of the Cuyuna Iron Range. The Trommald formation has been correlated with other iron formations of the Animikie Group, deposited during the early Proterozoic age, and is unique in the Lake Superior region because of the amount of manganese in part of the iron formation and ore. The stratigraphic column of the Trommald formation ranges from thick and consists of at least two mappable iron formation facies, one thick-bedded and cherty, divided by an aegirine zone, the other thin-bedded and slaty with a tourmaline zone at its base. The facies are sometimes separated by a black laminated carbonate-silicate iron formation. Gray phyllite lies above and below, capped with topsoil consisting of overlying morainic material and clay-rich till. Cuyuna Lakes Mountain Bike Trail running near an old waste rock stockpile of the Huntington-Feigh mine It is not possible to determine the mineral content in the iron formation from top to bottom in any one location due to the great diversity of ore textures and the shape of the ore bodies. Considerable variation exists in the character and composition of the ores, varying greatly from 20 to 60 percent iron and 0.5 to 15 percent manganese, with local areas of manganese as high as 50 percent. Most manganese is finely disseminated as an integral part of the iron ore. Ores of the Milford mine were brown and manganiferous; ores from the Gloria mine were black and slaty brown maganiferous; ores from the Merritt mine were red brown to black and richly manganiferous; ores from the Algoma mine were ferruginous manganese. The ores contained on average about 43% iron and 10% manganese. The Trommald formation and adjacent Emily district are the largest resource of manganese in the United States. The largest high-grade deposit of manganiferous ore is located about north of Manganese on a site at the edge of Emily. Valuable in steel and aluminum production, manganese is also used to make batteries. There is a local push to \\"scram\\" the stockpiles of ore found in the old waste rock of the Cuyuna Iron Range. This mining process is significantly less invasive than traditional blasting and crushing, but processing of some stockpiles would disrupt the Cuyuna Lakes Mountain Bike Trails, which opened in June 2011 and have been a tourism asset since the last manganiferous ore was shipped from the Cuyuna Range in 1984. This potential for ore processing has created debate as to whether mining and mountain biking can coexist. The use of former underground Cuyuna Range mines as a means of compressed-air energy storage has also been investigated by researchers at the University of Minnesota. Geography and climate Manganese lay at an elevation of in Crow Wing County, Minnesota, about northeast of Brainerd and west-southwest of Duluth. The nearest cities to Manganese were Trommald, approximately to the south-southwest, and Wolford, approximately to the northeast. Manganese was located to the west of Crow Wing County Road 30, about north of Minnesota State Highway 210 and west of Minnesota State Highway 6. Road to Manganese as viewed from the Milford Mine National Register Historic District Manganese was laid out with three primary north‚Äìsouth streets: First Street East, Main Street, and First Street West. Second Avenue North, First Avenue North, Manganese Avenue, First Avenue South (now Old Manganese Road), and Second Avenue South traversed Manganese from east to west. The Soo Line right of way bisected the community on the east side of Manganese from the southwest to the northeast. First Avenue North extended about to the Milford mine. Manganese was in the Laurentian Mixed Forest Province in the Brainerd Lakes Area of north central Minnesota. Precipitation ranges from about annually along the western border of the forest to about at its eastern edge. Average annual temperatures are about along the northern part of the forest, rising to at its southern extreme. July is the warmest month, when the average high temperature is and the average low is . January is the coldest, with an average high temperature of and average low of . The spring rains wreaked havoc on Manganese's clay streets, which was cited as one of the reasons for its abandonment.

Liddy, together with Sgt. Edward Ortiz and former Officer Michael Buchanan, were the first to be charged with criminal wrongdoing in the Rampart Scandal. Liddy was both the highest-ranking and the most decorated LAPD officer to be directly implicated by Rafael Perez, based upon his testimony and allegations. Their convictions in the Rampart scandal were thrown out by a judge. The officers later sued in civil proceedings and, seven years later, the 9th Circuit Federal Appeals Court upheld the lower court's ruling in their favor. Nearly $19 million went to resolve a federal jury verdict from 2006 that awarded $5 million each to Liddy, LAPD Officer Paul Harper, and LAPD Sgt. Edward Ortiz. A fourth man, former LAPD Officer Michael Buchanan, shared in a smaller settlement in another case. $20.5 million resolved six cases involving the officers. led to questions of Perez's credibility. Early career In 1993, almost three years after joining the force in 1990, Liddy was awarded the department's Medal of Valor for actions taken during a shoot-out during the Rodney King riots in 1992, while stationed at the 77th Street Division. In 1995, Liddy transferred to the Rampart Division's CRASH unit at the same time as Rafael Perez, who would later implicate Sgt. Liddy and over 70 other officers in several instances of police misconduct. Rampart Scandal More than 100 criminal cases were overturned after former LAPD Officer Rafael Perez testified that he, his partner and other officers (including Liddy) stationed in the Rampart CRASH unit had routinely framed gang members for crimes they did not commit. Perez made his allegations in exchange for leniency after he was caught stealing cocaine from a police evidence locker. However, the credibility of Perez has been undermined by his testimony in several internal affairs investigations in which three officers, including Liddy, accused of crimes or misconduct were found not guilty or the charges were dropped. Trial Liddy, along with Sgt. Edward Ortiz and Officer Paul Harper, were the first to be charged with conspiring to obstruct justice by then-Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti based on Perez's testimony. The criminal case against the Rampart officers revolved around a 1996 incident in which two reputed gang members were convicted of hitting Harper and Liddy with a pickup truck in an alley. Perez told authorities three years later that the officers made up the story to frame the pair. In a highly publicized trial in 2000, a Superior Court jury convicted the three officers of the charges, based on Perez's testimony. Afterward, however, Judge Jacqueline Connor vacated the verdicts, saying she had made a ‚Äúfatal error‚Äù in not recognizing that jurors might have misread some \\"jargon\\" in the police report that unintentionally lent support to the claim that the officers had lied. Lawsuit After their acquittals, in separate federal civil rights lawsuits filed on August 6, 2005, Liddy and the two other men charged in the trial accused former Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks and the LAPD of using them as ‚Äúscapegoats‚Äù to satisfy the media during the scandal involving the Rampart Division‚Äôs anti-gang unit, and that they were charged due to questionable testimony from Perez and other witnesses. In his lawsuit, Liddy alleged that a disciplinary board criticized internal affairs investigators for giving questionable facts to witnesses with criminal backgrounds who testified against the officers. The LAPD Board of Rights' official report stated the witnesses‚Äô recollections were ‚Äúpotentially tainted by the interview process and raised serious questions regarding their credibility,‚Äù according to the lawsuit. The board unanimously overruled discipline for Liddy, his lawsuit states. Disciplinary proceedings against Ortiz were pending. The three plaintiffs also accused the department of concealing from the district attorney‚Äôs office the names of witnesses who could have corroborated defense claims that Perez lied in his testimony about the officers. A civil jury awarded Liddy over five million dollars for violation of his civil rights in 2006. In January 2009, Liddy and the other two officers settled with the city on two other cases that alleged wrongful termination, and violation of civil rights. Liddy medically retired from the police department in 2006.

It played an important part in the establishment of Los Angeles as a major center of international trade and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its role in the development of the region's international trade and commerce. Construction and early years The development of the Panama Canal led Los Angeles business leaders to believe that, if modern port facilities could be built, the world's commercial fleet would descend on Los Angeles. When the canal opened in August 1914, World War I had postponed the city's plans. However, the city's Municipal Wharf No. 1 was nearly complete in 1914, and harbor officials next turned their attention the construction of a large bonded warehouse to handle the \\"sea caravans\\" that were expected to crowd the harbor at the end of the war. Plans for the new Municipal Warehouse, published in the Los Angeles Times, Dec. 6, 1914 By late 1914, foundation tests and paving activities were underway for a six-story warehouse to be built on Municipal Dock No. 1. And in December 1914, the Harbor Commission unveiled the structural plans (pictured to the left) prepared by Chief Harbor Engineer S.A. Jubb for the \\"mammoth new warehouse.\\" The Los Angeles Times reported at the time on the proposed design as follows: > \\"The massiveness and character of the structure, of course, preclude the > idea of architectural beauty and make any considerable degree of > ornamentation undesirable. Both commissions, however, are desirous that the > warehouse shall be more than merely a gigantic fireproof box with four > walls, a roof and various openings. Considerable study, therefore, has been > given to the treatment of cornice and wall panels, to the end that as > pleasing and symmetrical an effect may be obtained as is consistent with the > purposes and proportions of the building. > The warehouse will be of reinforced concrete construction and six stories in > height. It will be in length and wide, being the largest structure of its > kind ever erected west of Chicago. ... The warehouse is to stand at the > seaward end of the city's present great outer harbor dock ...\\" The original projected cost of the structure was $200,000 for the structural work and another $50,000 for equipment, though the final cost was nearly double -- $475,792.53. When plans were finalized in 1915, the Times reported that the enormous warehouse would require more than 27,000 cubic yards of cement and 1,200 tons of reinforcing steel and would be \\"by far the largest structure of its kind on the Pacific Coast.\\" The contract for the huge public works project was awarded to the Merchants' Realty and Investment Company of Los Angeles, and \\"unionites\\" immediately began making threats to \\"make trouble for the contractor as soon as work is started on the warehouse.\\" The first foundation piles were driven into the Huntington Fill in August 1915, and by the end of November, more than 3,000 piles had been sunk. The first concrete was poured in January 1916, and the basement and first floor were completed by early April 1916. However, construction was slowed by wartime shortages, and the Times reported in late April that the contractor was considering suspending operations altogether and laying off the 150 men working on the project, due to continuing problems with shortages of lumber, rock and gravel. When Municipal Warehouse No. 1 opened in April 1917, nearly 100 members of the city's Merchants' and Manufacturers' Association toured the warehouse and were told of its potential to assist them in their business. The Times described the operations at the warehouse as follows: > \\"Freight received by steamers will be sorted in the transit freight shed and > taken into the warehouse on electric trucks. Sixteen electric hoists have > been provided to convey the freight to the various lofts in the warehouse. > There are nearly twelve acres of floor space in the warehouse, which will be > leased by the city merchants and manufacturers. Here goods may be readied > for shipment and send direct from the warehouse by rail. Tracks run into the > warehouse and elevators are provided to take the goods from the lofts to the > loading platforms in the basement.\\" The warehouse was the Port's only bonded warehouse for many years and played a significant role in the establishment of the Port of Los Angeles as an international trade hub. The structure was built with an interior arcade with room for 24 freight cars. Rooftop operations Dozens of these decorative faces adorn the exterior of Municipal Warehouse No. 1 Because of its commanding view of the harbor, the roof of the warehouse has long been the site of various operations. Starting in the early 1920s, the Marine Exchange operated on its roof, providing lookout reports on ships entering and leaving the port. In 1925, the Radio Corporation of America located its harbor receiving station to the top of the massive warehouse. A new four-room lookout station for use by the Marine Exchange was built in 1928 atop the warehouse. The new station had a large circular window giving telescopes a commanding view of the harbor and ocean, and also included a neon red beacon which shed a red glow over the building at night. In 1939, the Los Angeles Times described the Exchange as \\"a world all its own up there on Warehouse No. 1.\\" In eight- hour shifts, three men manned the Exchange, climbing seven flights of stairs to reach the lookout station. The Times described the station as follows: \\"In one room with big windows commanding every approach from the sea, there is a large telescope on wheels. It can be pointed in any direction with the touch of a finger. At a little desk looking out over the channel and the harbor sits one of the three men who are on duty as lookouts ...\\" During World War II, as blackout rules were applied along the coast, the Marine Exchange ceased operations but resumed its lookout operations atop the warehouse in late 1945. In 1964, a new 26 x perch was built atop the warehouse for use by the Marine Exchange. The roof was also the site of a weather observation and signal facility for many years. Navy depot, Foreign Trade Zone 4, and historic designation Exterior of Municipal Warehouse No. 1 During World War II, the warehouse was turned over to the U.S. Navy for use as a supply depot. Returned to civilian use after the war, the fourth foreign trade zone in the United States was established at the warehouse in September 1949; it followed the success of such zones in New York, New Orleans and San Francisco. From 1949 to 1956 (when the foreign trade zone was terminated), the warehouse became \\"in effect a 'foreign island'\\" or \\"free city\\" where important goods could be manipulated, sorted, graded, inspected, and re-exported without payment of duties unless and until they were taken from the warehouse for distribution within the United States. By 1950, more than 100,000 local citizens were employed directly in foreign trade grossing $530 million, and the Los Angeles Foreign Trade Zone at Municipal Warehouse No. 1 was credited with helping Los Angeles become a major center of world trade. Over the years, as items were held for various customs or other reasons, Municipal Warehouse No. 1 became the home for a number of unusual items. In 1949, a group of camels being imported from Australia for a Shriners convention were held at the warehouse while quarantine requirements were met. And when an American museum imported the railroad car that carried Winston Churchill's body to burial, the railcar got no further than the port and was stored for many years in the Municipal Warehouse No. 1. In the 1970s, the introduction of cargo containerization eliminated the need for break-bulk warehousing, but Municipal Warehouse No. 1 has continued to be used as a bonded warehouse at the Port. It also serves as a visual landmark for ships entering the Port. In 2000, Municipal Warehouse No. 1 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places based on its contributions to international trade and commerce along the Pacific Coast.

Biography Megeath was from Virginia, and was descended from one of the early families of the state. He was born at the home of his maternal grandfather. His father was Joseph Pritchett Megeath who was born in 1800 in the same county and reared on the farm of his father Gabriel Megeath who lived and died in that county. As he neared adulthood, Joseph Pritchett Megeath left the parental farm and was engaged for some time in trading operating teams as far away as Ohio. Afterward, he engaged in general merchandising, owning and operating a farm for about twenty years, after which he retired and died at Philomont Loudoun county, Virginia in 1857. James G Megeath's mother was Elizabeth Cochran who was also born in Loudoun county. Virginia in 1803. She was a daughter of James Cochran who lived for many years in that county. James G Megeath could not secure living accommodations in that city and was compelled to cross the river to Council Bluffs. He remained in the latter city all winter but voted in Omaha on the day of his arrival from the East. He returned to Virginia in 1855 but two years later he again went to Omaha which was his home until his death. In the latter year he purchased a one third interest in the general merchandise business of Megeath & Co which had a store for a time on the south side of Farnam street a few doors east of 14th and later on the north side of Farnam upon the site of the present Megeath building. Megeath subsequently sold out his general merchandise business and embarked as the head of a company in the commission and forwarding business operating from the changing terminus of the Union Pacific Railroad until the latter road made its connection with the Central Pacific at Monument Point. This company did an enormous business. It handled 90 percent of the freight of the Union Pacific to be forwarded. Megeath early acquired large real estate interests in Omaha which was the means of greatly augmenting his large fortune. For a number of years on account of ill health he led a life of quiet retirement but during later years he was engaged in the active real estate business In 1872 he joined with Andrew J Hanscom in deeding to the city the property now known as Hanscom park comprising of natural park land the gift being conditioned solely upon its being retained for park purposes by the city and being improved to the extent of $25,000. Megeath and Peter E Her many years ago bought the McCoy distillery and with it formed what has since become the Willow Springs distillery property. After a few years however Mr Megeath disposed of his interest to the Hers. In 1860 he was a member of the city council. In 1866 he was speaker of representatives and during the same year was a member of the state senate at the special called for the election of two United States. He was also a member of the board of commissioners in the same year and in 1877 reelected to membership in the city council. In all of these responsible positions he rendered intelligent and effective service. He was an active democrat all his life. From the year 1848 he was an active member of the Masonic order and was the very early members of Capitol Lodge No organized in Omaha in 1857. Personal life In 1854 in Fauquier, Virginia, he was married to Miss Virginia Carter. She was daughter of George Carter and granddaughter of Ambrose Walden, who was a lieutenant in the American Revolutionary war. Mrs. Megeath was born in 1833 in Fauquier county and died in 1898. The issue of this union included Mrs. Beatty Robinson, wife of Major E.B. Robinson, 9th United States infantry born in Virginia in 1853, George Windsor born in Virginia in 1856, Joseph P born in Nebraska in 1857 and Samuel A born in Baltimore in 1870. Death Megeath died at the home of his son Joseph P in Salt Lake City in 1906.

A roadside bombing killed 21 women who were cleaning rubbish from a southern Mogadishu street on Sunday morning, a hospital official said. Mogadishu residents gathered around victims of the bomb attack along the city's Maka Al Mukarama Road. The bomb blast wounded another 46 people, most of them Somali women who had gathered to clean Maka Al Mukarama Road in southern Mogadishu's Kilometer 4 district, according to Medina Hospital director Dr. Dahir Dhere. Quotes \\"It suddenly turned the area into a carnage, scattering body parts of the street cleaners into a large area,\\" said witness Asha Ise Gedi. \\"There were pools of blood everywhere. I have never seen such mass killing.\\" \\"They were innocent poor mothers or sisters,\\" Gedi said. \\"Why did they deserve this?\\" Investigation It is unclear who is behind the attack. Mogadishu Mayor Mohamed Omar Habeb Dhere, who was recently fired by the country's prime minister, blamed the Islamic Courts Union for waging the attack. But the head of the Islamist insurgent group, Abid Rahim Ise Adow, denied any involvement and blamed Somalia's government for orchestrating the attack. The victims were participating in a program that allows Somali women to work as street cleaners in exchange for food. The United Nations' World Food Program organized the program, which began last year and is administered by Mogadishu's regional authority.

The term corporate welfare is widely used to describe the bestowal of favorable treatment to big business (particular corporations) by the government. One of the most commonly raised forms of criticism are statements that the capitalist political economy toward large corporations allows them to \\"privatize profits and socialize losses.\\" The argument has been raised and cited on many occasions.  History and usage  The phrase may have been first popularized by Michael Harrington's 1962 book The Other America in which Harrington cited Charles Abrams, a well-known authority on housing. Andrew Young has been cited for calling the United States system ‚Äúsocialism for the rich and free enterprise for the poor‚Äù, and Martin Luther King, Jr. frequently used this wording in his speeches.Thomas F. Jackson, Martin Luther King: From Civil Rights to Human Rights: Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Struggle for Economic Justice, , , page 332 Since at least 1969, Gore Vidal widely disseminated the expression ‚Äúfree enterprise for the poor and socialism for the rich‚Äù to describe the U.S. economic policies,Gore Vidal: Reflections Upon a Sinking Ship, Little, Brown, 1969Gore Vidal: Imperial America, September 1, 2004 notably using it from the 1980s in his critiques of Reaganomics.'Free enterprise for the poor, socialism for the rich': Vidal's claim gains leverage, irishtimes.com, September 20, 2008 In winter 2006/2007, in response to criticism about oil imports from Venezuela, that country being under the leadership of Hugo Ch√°vez, the founder and president of Citizens Energy Corporation Joseph P. Kennedy II countered with a critique of the U.S. system which he characterized as ‚Äúa kind of socialism for the rich and free enterprise for the poor that leaves the most vulnerable out in the cold‚Äù.Kennedy: U.S. oil companies profit; Citgo helps the poor, MetroWest Daily News, January 24, 2007 Also Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has become known for expressing to large audiences that the United States is now a land of ‚Äúsocialism for the rich and brutal capitalism for the poor‚Äù.Mark Jacobson: American Jeremiad, New York Magazine, February 5, 2007 Economist Dean Baker expressed similar views in his book The Conservative Nanny State: How the Wealthy Use the Government to Stay Rich and Get Richer, in which he pointed out several different policy areas in which government intervention is essential to preserving and enhancing wealth in the hands of a few. Reviewed in: Scott Piatkowski: Socialism for the rich, www.rabble.ca, May 25, 2006 Linguist Noam Chomsky has criticized the way in which free market principles have been applied. He has argued that the wealthy use free-market rhetoric to justify imposing greater economic risk upon the lower classes, while being insulated from the rigours of the market by the political and economic advantages that such wealth affords.Takis Michas, \\"The Other Chomsky\\", Wall Street Journal, November 4, 2005. Reproduced on Chomsky's official site. He remarked, \\"the free market is socialism for the rich--[free] markets for the poor and state protection for the rich.\\"Noam Chomsky, \\"The Passion for Free Markets\\", Z Magazine, May 1997. Reproduced on Chomsky's official site. He has stated that the rich and powerful \\"want to be able to run the nanny state\\" so that \\"when they are in trouble the taxpayer will bail them out\\", citing \\"too big to fail\\" as an example. Economist Ha-Joon Chang widens the concept towards self-serving macroeconomic policies of the West that disadvantage the developing world as Keynsianism for the rich, and monetarism for the poor. Arguments along a similar line were raised in connection with the financial turmoil in 2008. With regard to the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Ron Blackwell, chief economist of AFL-CIO, used the expression ‚ÄúSocialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor‚Äù to characterize the system.Fannie/Freddie's ‚ÄúSocialism for Rich‚Äù, July 15, 2008 In September 2008, the US Senator Bernie Sanders said regarding the bailout of the U.S. financial system: ‚ÄúThis is the most extreme example that I can recall of socialism for the rich and free enterprise for the poor‚Äù. The same month, economist Nouriel Roubini stated: ‚ÄúIt is pathetic that Congress did not consult any of the many professional economists that have presented [‚Ä¶] alternative plans that were more fair and efficient and less costly ways to resolve this crisis. This is again a case of privatizing the gains and socializing the losses; a bailout and socialism for the rich, the well-connected and Wall Street‚Äù.Nouriel Roubini: Nouriel Roubini's Global EconoMonitor, September 28, 2008 Former U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich adapted this phrase on The Daily Show on October 16, 2008: \\"We have socialism for the rich, and capitalism for everyone else.\\"Interview with Jon Stewart, The Daily Show, Oct 16, 2008: Available at The Daily Show Site Journalist John Pilger included the phrase in his speech accepting Australia's human rights award, the Sydney Peace Prize, on 5th November 2009: \\"Democracy has become a business plan, with a bottom line for every human activity, every dream, every decency, every hope. The main parliamentary parties are now devoted to the same economic policies - socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor - and the same foreign policy of servility to endless war. This is not democracy. It is to politics what McDonald's is to food.\\"Full transcript of the John Pilger speech at the Sydney Opera House to mark his award of Australia's human rights prize, the Sydney Peace Prize: U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders referenced the phrase during his eight-and-a-half-hour speech on the senate floor on December 10, 2010 against the continuation of Bush-era tax cuts, when speaking on the federal bailout of major financial institutions at a time when small-businesses were being denied loans.

He immigrated to Los Angeles in 1967, where he attended Los Angeles City College studying music, and entrenched himself in the music community. Conte began his music career as a studio musician for Latin Jazz acts like Caldera. His live performance and touring career took off when he joined Madonna's touring band in the 1980s. To date, Conte has built an extremely successful career including a run composing and playing in ABC TV's Dancing with the Stars band, among dozens or hundreds of other TV and film projects.  Early years  As a child in Cuba, Conte began his musical odyssey playing the guitar. However, he soon switched to percussion, and that has remained his primary instrument ever since. He was sent to Los Angeles by his parents in 1967, in order to prevent him from being forced to serve in the Cuban military. This was a turning point in Conte's life, as the musical community in Los Angeles during this period was quite vibrant. It was during this period that he studied at Los Angeles City College.  Musical career  Luis Conte (rear), plays with James Taylor's \\"Band of Legends.\\" Conte proved himself versatile musically, and by 1973, he was playing regularly in local clubs. He quickly became a busy studio musician, and throughout the 1970s, he played in the Latin Jazz band Caldera. In the 1980s, Conte toured with several different musicians, including Madonna, guitarist Al Di Meola, and Andy Narell. His debut as a bandleader came in 1987, when he released La Cocina Caliente, which included a Latinized version of Chopin's \\"Susarasa\\". Conte also played percussion on the Pat Metheny Group release 'We Live Here', in 1995, on the Pat Metheny 'From This Place', in 2020 as well as I Mother Earth's first two albums Dig (1993) and Scenery and Fish (1996). Recently, Conte has toured as part of James Taylor's \\"Band of Legends.\\" He has also played alongside such famed musicians as Alex Acu√±a, Jaguares, Larry Klimas, and David Garfield, both as a bandleader and a sideman. Luis Conte was part of Phil Collins 1997 \\"Dance into the Light\\" tour and 2004 \\"First Farewell Tour\\", performing in both of them Afro-Cuban percussion and adding more depth into the concert songs. He also performed during The Phil Collins Big Band tours in 1996 and 1998 and again during the Phil Collins Not Dead Yet tours 2017/2018. In 1999 Conte collaborated in Man√° MTV Unplugged project. In 2009 worked together with Sergio Vall√≠n in his Bendito Entre Las Mujeres album.

The conflict ended any possibility of restoration of the empire of Alexander the Great, a result confirmed in the Battle of Ipsus. It also marked the infancy of the Seleucid Empire by giving Seleucus control over the eastern satrapies of Alexander's former empire. Preliminaries After the death of Alexander the Great on 11 June 323 BC, his empire disintegrated. Officers who were trying to save it were defeated during the First War of the Diadochi. During the Second War of the Diadochi, the power of Antigonus I Monophthalmus, who had created a state of his own in Anatolia and Syria, was growing; this caused alarm among the other generals, but in the Third War of the Diadochi, Antigonus managed to keep Ptolemy I Soter of Egypt and Cassander of Macedon in check. In December 311, the warring parties concluded the Peace of the Dynasts, and recognized each other. The only ruler who was excluded was Seleucus I Nicator. Antigonus had expelled Seleucus, satrap of Babylonia, in 316,All dates according to Tom Boiy, Between High and Low.

Antigonus' satraps in Media and Aria, Nicanor and Euagoras, now decided to intervene with an army of 10,000 infantry and 7,000 horsemen, but Seleucus and an army of 3,000 infantry and 400 cavalry had been waiting for them near the Tigris since September 311.Chronicle of the Diadochi, rev., iv.9-10'; for the numbers, Diodorus, World History, 19.91. By hiding his men in one of the marshes and attacking by night, Seleucus was able to defeat the Macedonian soldiers in the army of Nicanor and Euagoras, after which the Iranian soldiers decided to side with the ruler of Babylonia (November 311).Chronicle of the Diadochi, rev., iv.11' with Diodorus, World History, 19.91. Without any problems, Seleucus could move through the Zagros Mountains, occupy Ecbatana (the capital of Media), and continue to Susa (the capital of Elam). He now controlled southern Iraq and the greater part of Iran. News of the defeat of Nicanor and Euagoras must have reached Antigonus at about the time of his signing the Peace of the Dynasts (December 311). He ordered his son Demetrius Poliorcetes to restore order; he arrived in the early spring of 310, when Seleucus was still in the east. Although Demetrius managed to enter Babylon, he was not able to cope with the resistance that Seleucus' adherents were able to organize, and he returned to Syria without having achieved his goal.Diodorus, World History, 19.100. His father Antigonus tried again in the autumn of 310, and also managed to enter Babylon,Chronicle of the Diadochi, rev., iv.14-20'. but was forced to leave the city in March 309.Chronicle of the Diadochi, rev., iv.22'. Returning to the northwest, he met the army of Seleucus, who ordered his soldiers to have their meal during the night, attacked Antigonus' soldiers while they were having breakfast, and won a decisive victory.Polyaenus, Strategems 4.9.1; cf. Pat Wheatley, \\"Antigonus Monophthalmus in Babylonia, 310-308 B.C.\\" in: Journal of Near Eastern Studies 61 (2002), 39-47. Significance Antigonus retreated and accepted that Babylonia, Media, and Elam belonged to Seleucus. The victor now moved to the east and reached the Indus valley, where he concluded a treaty with Chandragupta Maurya. The Mauryan emperor received the eastern parts of the Seleucid Empire, which included Afghanistan, Pakistan and west India, and gave Seleucus a formidable force of five hundred war elephants.Strabo, Geography 15.2.1. By adding all of Iran and Afghanistan, Seleucus became the most powerful ruler since Alexander the Great.Arrian of Nicomedia, Anabasis, 7.22.5. Restoration of Alexander's Empire was, after the Babylonian War, no longer possible. This outcome was confirmed in the Fourth War of the Diadochi and the Battle of Ipsus (301). Sources Our knowledge is based on Diodorus Siculus, World History, 19.90-93 and 19.100. He discusses Seleucus' battle against the satraps and Demetrius and offers plausible numbers for the armies, but ignores the campaign of Antigonus. This is described in one of the contemporary Babylonian Chronicles, the Chronicle of the Diadochi (= ABC 10 = BCHP 3), which also offers the chronological framework. Since the publication of this cuneiform tablet, now in the British Museum, our understanding of this conflict has much increased. Literature * T. Boiy, Between High and Low.

It lies in the parish of St Mewan. The nearest town is St Austell three miles (4.5 km) to the north-east. Great Hewas Mine In 1785, Sticker was described as \\"a new place\\"J. WesleyJournal, Vol. 4, p. 305 (1867) and it was a settlement for workers in the Great Hewas Mine on its western outskirts. Great Hewas was worked in the 18th century, a 45-inch Boulton & Watt pumping engine was installed in the 1790s. By the 19th century, the mine employed over 250 people, producing not only tin, but copper, lead, and some silver. Two smaller mines to the west, Ventonwyn and Hewas Water, worked alongside Great Hewas. The last of these mines ceased production in 1926, though the chimney of Ventonwyn engine house is still a local landmark. Village history St Mark's Mission Church John Wesley, founder of Methodism, preached at Sticker in August 1785, when the Methodist theologian Adam Clarke was one of the circuit ministers for the village.A. Clarke et al., An account of the infancy, religious and literary life of Adam Clarke, p.178 (1833) A Methodist chapel in Lower Sticker was built by miners in their spare time in 1836. A second chapel was built in Sticker in 1876. An Anglican church was designed by architect George Edmund Street in 1848/49,A. E. Street, A Memoir of George Edmund Street, p. 11 (1972) but was never built. The current St Mark's Mission Church was designed by James Piers St Aubyn and opened in 1877. St Mark's is a chapel of ease for the parish church at St Mewan. One of the oldest establishments in the village is the Hewas Inn, formerly the Great Hewas Inn, which was rebuilt in 1825 and is now a Grade II listed building. The village today Since the 1960s, large numbers of bungalows and housing estates have been built in and around the village, which is within commuting distance of St Austell and Truro. As a result, Sticker now has around 450 homes, a population of about 1150 and an electorate of around 850. It has a shop and post office and a regular bus service to St Austell, Truro and the surrounding villages. The village hall is maintained and run by Sticker Village Association. St Mark's church and the Methodist chapel have community halls. David Tremlett, the conceptual artist, grew up in Sticker. Sport The village also has its own non league football club, Sticker A.F.C. who currently play in the South West Peninsula League at Burngullow Lane.Cornwall FA: Sticker Switch on New Lights - Cornwall FA, accessdate: February 2, 2020 ReferencesExternal links Category:Villages in Cornwall ","title":"Sticker, Cornwall"},{"id":"18704592","text":"West Park Oval is an Australian Rules football, cycling and athletics venue located on the shores of Bass Strait in Burnie, Tasmania. It is the current home of the Burnie Dockers in the Tasmanian State League and previously in the NTFL and in the original TFL Statewide League. History West Park Oval was also home of the former Cooee Football Club (later renamed Burnie Hawks in 1987 and the former Burnie Tigers Football Club in the North West Football Union (NWFU) and later of the NTFL until both clubs amalgamated in early 1994. The ground hosted five Tasmanian State Grand Finals between 1961 and 1978, including the final State Premiership decider held in 1978, and was also the site of some of Tasmanian football's most infamous matches. During an NWFU match in 1936 a hurricane hit West Park in the final quarter of a match between Burnie Tigers and Penguin, and as players were unable to keep their feet in the blinding rain and wind, many lay flat in the mud as there was great panic in the crowd as the hurricane threatened to demolish the Main Stand. Burnie (finishing the match with eleven men on the field) won 8.10 (58) to Penguin (who finished with six men on the field) 2.5 (17). Arguably, Tasmanian football's most controversial match was the 1967 Tasmanian State Premiership Final between Wynyard and North Hobart, where hundreds of Wynyard fans invaded the field and tore down the goalposts as North Hobart's Dickie Collins went back to take a kick after the siren with Wynyard leading by one point. Umpires, players, team officials and police attempted to clear a path for Collins to take his kick, but Collins was eventually escorted from the ground under police protection, taking the match ball with him as a souvenir. The Tasmanian Football League declared the match a \\"no result\\" and withheld the 1967 State Premiership. In 1967, a ground record crowd for a football match of 12,951 attended an exhibition match between the North Western Football Union representative team and the defending Victorian Football League premiers, . St Kilda 35.27 (237) defeated NWFU 13.7 (85). In 1996, visiting side Hobart became the first side in the TFL in 38 years not to register a goal in a senior match, managing a paltry 0.5 (5) against the Burnie Dockers and losing by 97 points in atrocious conditions. The lowest attendance ever recorded at a TFL final was recorded at West Park in atrocious weather conditions in 1997 where only 1,010 braved the elements to see the Burnie Dockers defeat Clarence 14.4 (88) to 2.8 (20) in the Qualifying Final (the two sides would meet again three weeks later in the Grand Final at North Hobart Oval and fight out a 38-goal thriller, with Clarence turning the tables on the hapless Dockers). It hosted AFL pre-season practice matches in the early 1990s, with over 12,000 attending the Carlton v St Kilda match in 1991. West Park was the first Tasmanian football venue to install lights for night football, the first night match was played between Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) in a Foster's NFL Shield match on 9 June 1989 where the visiting team won by 14 points in wet and cold conditions. It became the first ground to host a night match in TFL history on 15 May 1993 when Burnie Hawks defeated coastal-rival Devonport by 51 points. 300px West Park is also the home of the Burnie Athletics Club and the City of Burnie Cycling Club; the ground hosts the Burnie Gift and Burnie Wheel each year. In 1977 cyclist Danny Clark staged one of the most memorable moments in Tasmanian sporting history when he surged from the rear of the pack, 100m behind on the final lap to scream home to take out the 1977 Burnie Wheel before almost 15,000 screaming fans on 1 January 1977. The legendary call of the finish of the race by North West Coastal sporting identity Harold 'Tiger' Dowling is etched in Coastal sporting folklore. West Park has three grandstands, the 1914-built Burnie Athletic Club Memorial Stand on the Bass Strait side of the ground, an open stand on the opposite wing opened during the 1960s and the newly built The Point members pavilion opened in 2009. A State cricket match between Tasmania and New South Wales was held at the venue on 4 December 2010. After losing the toss Tasmania were put in and scored 189 in the hybrid one- day format. New South Wales won by 7 wickets. The crowd was 4,552, the highest crowd at the venue since the former TFL Statewide League. The match was played under foggy but clearing skies to a fine 26 degrees. Glenn McGrath was a special guest at the match. Since the small boundary towards the Southern End is approximately 70 metres, Phil Hughes hit a ball onto the Bass Highway to the delight of the crowd. The ground is scheduled to hold another List A match in November 2011 between Tasmania and South Australia in the 2011‚Äì12 Ryobi One-Day Cup.

He was a leading figure in the political life of the Spanish Netherlands. Life Arenberg was the son of Charles de Ligne, 2nd Prince of Arenberg and Anne de Croy, daughter of Philipe de Cro√ø, Duke of Aerschot. He was named Duke of Aarschot in 1616, and attained the highest honors in the Habsburg Netherlands, including the Order of the Golden Fleece. As duke he was the first lord temporal in the States of Brabant, and in the Estates General of 1632.Louis Prosper Gachard, Actes des √âtats G√©n√©raux de 1632 (Brussels, 1853), p. 63. Marriage and children He married three times: * on 21 September 1610 with Pierre Hippolyte Anne de Melun, Baronesse de Caumont, died 1615 * on 28 June 1620 with Isabelle Claire de Berlaymont, Comtesse de Lalaing, died 1630 * on 29 March 1632 with Countess Maria Cleopha von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (1599‚Äì1685) and had nine children, two sons and seven daughters. The sons were : *Philippe Fran√ßois, 1st Duke of Arenberg (1625‚Äì1674) *Charles Eugene, 2nd Duke of Arenberg (1633‚Äì1681) Arrest and death He fell from grace in 1634, and spent the last six years of his life under house arrest in Madrid. The arrest occurred while he was on a diplomatic mission in Spain. Charged with requesting Philip IV to grant the States General of the southern Netherlands the power to negotiate a truce or peace with the United Provinces, Aarschot was sent to Spain in December 1633 as the highest-ranking member of the nobility of the Duchy of Brabant. Although initially received with great consideration by Philip IV, he was denounced four months after his arrival, accused of participating in the 1632 conspiracy to overthrow Spanish rule in the Netherlands. While admitting knowledge of the plot, he denied involvement in it and maintained his innocence. Despite letters from the Archduchess Isabella written on his behalf, Aarschot was imprisoned for some months before being placed under house arrest, in December 1634. Three years later his wife and eldest son joined him, but they were not allowed to reside in his quarters. Aarschot's depressing and restrictive circumstances brought on a debilitating disease, to which he succumbed in 1640. Shortly before his death, Philip IV sent word that his case was under review and a favorable outcome was expected; the duke was too ill to rally, however, and he died the day after receiving the king's message. Art collector Philippe-Charles d'Arenberg was a great art- collector and purchased paintings from artists like Paul de Vos, Frans Snyders, Gaspar de Crayer, and Salomon Noveliers, court painter to the archdukes in Brussels. The best known of several Rubens paintings that Arenberg owned was the Wolf and Fox Hunt, believed to be the work today in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. The duke of Aarschot was also responsible for the acquisition of Rubens's late Martyrdom of St. Andrew for the Flemish Hospital in Madrid, where it still remains today.Philippe Charles.

In 2008, MIT Technology Review called it one of the \\"10 technologies most likely to change the way we live.\\"\\"TR10: Reality Mining\\", Technology Review Magazine Reality mining studies human interactions based on the usage of wireless devices such as mobile phones and GPS systems providing a more accurate picture of what people do, where they go, and with whom they communicate with rather than from more subjective sources such as a person's own account. Reality mining is one aspect of digital footprint analysis.\\"There's Gold in 'Reality Mining, BusinessWeek 2008 Reality Mining is using Big Data to conduct research and analyze how people interact with technology everyday to build systems that allow for positive change from the individual to the global community. Reality Mining also deals with data exhaust .  Individual Scale (1 person)  Individuals use mobile phones, tablets, laptops, cameras, and any device connected to the internet for a variety of purposes, therefore creating a variety of data from GPS locations to frequently asked questions on Google. Mobile phones carry so much data about the individual that now phones can suggest restaurants based on our searches, visited places, book preference, and even guess the ends of sentences we type. A simple application of Reality Mining is listening to voices and understanding speech patterns to diagnose medical problems such as the simple flu to even early onset Parkinson's. More powerful phones also allow for calendar customization and event tracking which display behaviors within individuals, what is deemed important enough to track. Social websites also allow researchers to view snapshots of a person's life by following status updates on FaceBook or tweets from Twitter. Even more specific, a recent app called Snapchat allows users to post videos, pictures, or even live streams of exactly what they're doing when they're doing it, strong indicators of behaviors and interactions with the world. In 2004, MIT conducted the Reality Mining Project which gave 100 MIT students a Nokia 6600 which was tracked in a variety of ways by the researchers. The Cell Tower ID #'s (a very cheap and unobtrusive way to measure location), the status of the phone (charging or idle), and any use of the phone's applications (games, web surfing, etc...). They found that by collecting this kind of data, they could predict with high accuracy the behaviors of the students, for example, if one of the students woke up on a Saturday morning at 10 AM, the researches could predict what they were going to do that day using \\"eigenbehaviors\\". This new way of understanding data opened up doors for new research and possibly even larger survey research with detailed and accurate statistics. There are hundreds of websites offering software for mobile phones that will track just about everything the phone does, useful for worried parents or people who want to increase their personal productivity. This data is then uploaded to a server and can be accessed at any time. Although already a lot of data can be collected from personal devices, they only make up a part of a person's life. Reality Miners can also use biometric devices to measure physical health and activity. There are many devices like this such as the Fitbit, Nike+, and Polar and Garmin GPS watches. There is even an app called Sleep Cycle for iPhone and Android users that measures sleep quality, which includes the amount of sleep and even optimal alarms settings. Using this data, Reality Miners may be able to measure one's actual health and processes that allow us to function (or dysfunction). Heart attacks generally don't have any longitudinal indicators, but using all this data or even when a person engages in Lifelogging can create date useful to the medical field and track the lifestyles of those who undergo heart attacks to then create preventative guidelines. There are several ways to start Lifelogging, for instance Google has its own device called Google Glass that has a Heads-Up-Display (HUD), a microphone, a processor, and a camera. These are all ways to log information in specific directories.  Community Scale (10 to 1,000 people)  The way researchers have started to observe and record behaviors in large groups was by using RFID badges. Data is also recorded in work places using Knowledge Management Systems that try to improve worker productivity and efficiency, although a short-coming of this is the inability to converge the social and technological cultures of the work place, therefore providing incomplete behavioral data. Another way to measure larger groups of people in a community is through conference attendance. This data allows researchers to know where participants are from, ethnic demographics, and the actual number of people attending the event. Some conferences use smart-badges with more functions than the standard RFID badges. Companies like Microsoft and IBM have used them to record the number of people they interact with during the conference and allow people to answer survey questions. The smart-badges also record vocal interactions and when attendees are at certain booths and can even alert booth workers when certain profiles enter within a certain range of the booth. Smart-badges have obvious advantages for gathering data for reality miners. In 2009, a company called nTag, which was then acquired by Alliance Technology used nTag technology which allows for users to even be notified whom to talk to and its able to exchange business cards electronically. Another type of data reality miners are looking are climate and environmental information. They collect data from neighborhoods by employing air-quality sensors which records carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides as well as the general climate. Information like this could help policy makers decide whether to act or not or to see progress. Another way to collect data about the surrounding is through Project Noah. Project Noah was an effort to collect data on types of plant species by geotagging pictures of plants and fungi people upload, allowing users to see the kind of ecosystems users live in. This helps schools and students who want to collect data for projects, but also for bird-watchers to know what kind of birds are in the area.  City Scale (1,000 to 1,000,000 people)  In general terms for this section, a city is defined by 1,000 to 1,000,000 people. One way data is collected on a city scale is through collecting data on traffic with traffic signals and speed cameras. Data can also be collected from police reports and road scanners as well as GPS from mobile applications. Using this kind of traffic data, cities can create routes that would best allow for efficient movement and flow of traffic. A company called Inrix, started in 2010, has been compiling data on traffic and buys data from bridge operators and other transportation systems. It uses this data to predict traffic routes and time of congestion. Another way traffic can be monitored is through bluetooth technology, which is a technology that Inrix does not consider. The University of Maryland completed a project in 2012 that demonstrated that two Bluetooth sensors permanently placed two miles apart could accurately detect traffic speeds.BLUETOOTH TRAFFIC MONITORING TECHNOLOGY - UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND ‚Äì CENTER FOR ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY All of this combined can be created to make route-suggestion algorithms to help people get to and from places in an efficient matter that, additionally, the route can update itself in real time using these type of sensors and information. Notable start-up, now a subsidiary of google, Waze, which also collected data from users (anonymously) who reported accidents and this game them in-app currencies and rewards. For crime on the city scale, the first way to collect and view data is through historical research of previous reports within any area. Now, more complex algorithms automatically place officers in places of high crime rates before any actual crime has been committed. Since 2005, the Memphis Police Department has been using a program called Blue CRUSH (Criminal Reduction Utilization Statistical History) which uses the police reports and uses heat maps to distinguish between high and low areas of crime. This program updates itself weekly and allows to the police department to change tactics accordingly. Using this kind of data will allow police departments to interact with the society in a much more meaningful way, also allowing preventative work to be done rather than rehabilitative work.  National Scale (1,000,000 to 100,000,000 people)  On the national scale, government play a much larger role. Census data are by far the easiest to acquire. Many nations make their census findings public via websites from which data can be downloaded and visualized for further analysis. \\"In addition, the World Bank conducts international surveys and compiles census data from all participating nations‚Äî a sort of one-stop shop for information on its member countries. These data are publicly accessible: they can be downloaded and independently sorted and analyzed. Importantly, the World Bank offers an open API that allows programmers to integrate various data into software applications. Using World Bank data, Google has integrated a simple visualization tool into its search results; a search query on the population of Botswana will pull up the number, the dated World Bank source, and a graph showing population change over decades\\". Another way to collect data is through call data record (or call detail record) which is just a log of phone calls and texts with information such as time and location of both the caller or sender and the recipient. CDR's allow phone companies to view human mobility trends. Major data companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter also allow researchers to track cultural trends and even the when/where of the allocation of resources in time of natural disasters.  Global Scale (100,000,000 to 7,000,000,000 people)  The biggest worry for the world is the spread of disease and is one of reality mining's best applications. With globalization, the ability to travel is unprecedented compared to previous histories. The United Nations has created an agenda called the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) which are eight goals that aim to improve the world. They collect population data, the first step to allowing for policy making on disease control, nations must first collect data on air travel as billions of people travel by air each year and sea travel. Air travel carries more people each year than sea shipments, but the primary reason for collecting data on shipments is that shipments often carry pests that carry diseases, food-borne illnesses, and sometimes invasive species of plant and animal. The idea of managing and collecting seems monumental, but the World Bank has already started which helps statistical software like MAPS which stands for Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics. MAPS aims to complete six objectives, which include these three; * Planning statistical systems and preparing national statistical development strategies for all low-income countries * Ensuring full participation of developing countries * Setting up the International Household Survey Network, a global collection of household-based socioeconomic data sets For people traveling on flights, a source of data is the International Air Transportation Association (IATA) which has been collecting data on about 90% of global air traffic on a monthly basis since 2000. This data allowed researchers and professionals to view the ability of disease to spread from certain location on Earth. Ships carry about 90% of global trade; in 2001, the Automatic Identification system was implemented to record the \\"comings and goings of sea traffic\\".

The station opened in 1937 and closed in 1967.  History  Prompted by holiday camp development in the area, the Southern Railway decided in 1937 to realign its branch line to New Romney (which had been opened in 1884) closer to the sea and to open two intermediate stations - Lydd-on-Sea and Greatstone-on-Sea. The opening of Lydd-on-Sea on 4 July 1937 coincided with the closure of Dungeness station to passengers; it was intended that Lydd-on-Sea, ¬Ω-mile from Dungeness, would serve both locations and its running in board read \\"Lydd-on-Sea (for Dungeness)\\". To handle the expected flow of holiday traffic, the station was equipped with a long curved island platform with a passing loop on which was perched a small wooden shed.Subterranea Britannica, \\"Lydd-on-Sea Halt\\". The traffic never materialised and the station was downgraded to an unstaffed halt on 20 September 1954 when its passing loop was also lifted. As passenger traffic dwindled and freight became insignificant, the New Romney branch fell into decline and was listed for closure in the Beeching Report. In 1966 the Minister of Transport Barbara Castle announced her intention of closing the Appledore to New Romney Branch and passenger services ceased on 6 March 1967.  Present day  Although the trackbed from Romney Junction towards New Romney is easily traceable, nothing remains of Lydd-on-Sea Halt today except for a gated concrete approach road from Kerton Road . The island platform was demolished at some point after 1983.

It was named for William Carey, a noted English Baptist missionary. The Carey Mission's official nature and reputation made it a headquarters for settlers and a point from which the American frontier was extended.Fuller, George Newman (1916). Economic and Social Beginnings of Michigan, pp. 258-60. Lansing, MI: Wynkoop Hallenbeck Crawford Co. History Lewis Cass, the second governor of the Michigan Territory, signed the Treaty of Chicago on August 29, 1821, with the chiefs of the Ottawa, Chippewa, and Potawatomi nations. The Potawatomi agreed to cede to the United States all the territory lying west and north of the St. Joseph River,Glover, Lowell H. (1906). A Twentieth Century History of Cass County, Michigan, pp. 17-19. The Lewis Publishing Company. and the United States agreed to provide funds for a blacksmith and a teacher, to reside on \\"one mile square on the south side of the St. Joseph\\" within a tract that the Potawatomis had reserved for their villages. McCoy, who had previously traveled to Detroit and petitioned Cass to provide funds for Indian missions in the 1821 Treaty, secured the position of teacher.Fisher, Ernest B. (1918). Grand Rapids and Kent County, Michigan: Historical Account of Their Progress from First Settlement to the Present Time, pp. 39-45. Chicago: Robert O. Law Company. In December 1822, McCoy and his family, and a group of Indians who had elected to accompany them (32 persons in all), set out for southwestern Michigan. They emigrated from the vicinity of Fort Wayne, Indiana, to a point about a mile west of the present city of Niles, and by the following year they had built six mission houses. The first school at Carey was opened on January 27, 1823, and originally had 30 Indian pupils. An expedition that visited the mission in June 1823 reported, \\"The school consists of from forty to sixty children, of which fifteen are females. They are either children of Indians, or half-breed descendants of French and Indian parents; there being about an equal number of each. It is contemplated that the school will soon be increased to one hundred.\\"Keating, William H. (1824). Narrative of an Expedition to the Source of St. Peter's River, pp. 149-50. Philadelphia: H. C. Carey and I. Lea. In 1824 an agent for Cass reported that the Carey Mission was \\"a colony firmly settled, numerous, civilized and happy\\". Fifty densely wooded acres had been cleared and fenced, and workers had raised large amounts of corn, oats, and potatoes. By 1826 over of land had been cleared, and had been planted. The mission became a way station for white settlers of the Michigan Territory. McCoy realized that they would soon supplant the native Indians. He wrote: \\"Our location was so remote from the settlements of white people when we first made it, and the inconveniences of reaching and residing at it so great, that we hoped, at that time, to be able to push forward the work of civilization to a state not much liable to injury by the proximity of white population, before we should be crowded by it.\\"McCoy, Isaac (1840). History of Baptist Indian Missions, p. 264. Washington: William M. Morrison. During the period from 1827 to 1829, southwestern Michigan began to be actively settled, and the Carey Mission declined, as a result of the U.S. policy of Indian removal. In 1827, in the Treaty of St. Joseph, the Potawatomi tribe ceded some of their reserved lands in southwestern Michigan. The treaty stated that its purpose was \\"to consolidate some of the dispersed bands of the Potawatamie Tribe in the Territory of Michigan at a point removed from the road leading from Detroit to Chicago, and as far as practicable from the settlements of the Whites\\".Kappler, Charles J. (1903). Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties, p. 283. Washington: Government Printing Office. In 1829 McCoy removed to the Thomas station, another mission he had established near the Grand River. The only missionary who remained at Carey was Robert Simerwell.Newcomb, Harvey (2nd rev. ed.) (1860). A Cyclopedia of Missions, p. 586. New York: Charles Scribner. With passage of the Indian Removal Act in 1830, the school at Carey Mission was discontinued, and in 1831 McCoy led a number of the Potawatomi to a new mission in Kansas. Significance The founding of the Carey Mission was, according to Michigan jurist Nathaniel Bacon, \\"the pioneer step in the way of settlement.\\" Bacon remarked that in 1822, when the mission was established, the region was considered by European settlers to be dangerous and hostile. Within recent memory were the Battle of Tippecanoe in Indiana and the Battle of Fort Dearborn in Illinois. \\"Emigration had in a great measure stopped. Very few dared to venture beyond the older settlements, until McCoy boldly entered into the heart of the Indian country, and began his mission school among the Pottawottomies who dwelt on the river St. Joseph. The fact was soon made known throughout Indiana and Ohio, and at once adventurers began to prepare to follow the example of the missionary, who had led the way.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Isaac McCoy Papers, 1808-1874 Category:Pre-statehood history of Michigan Category:Berrien County, Michigan Category:Potawatomi Category:1822 establishments in Michigan Territory ","title":"Carey Mission"},{"id":"18704724","text":"Hamaas Abdul Khaalis (1921‚Äì2003), born Ernest Timothy McGhee, also known as Ernest \\"XX\\" McGee and Ernest 2X McGee, was leader of the Hanafi Movement, an African-American Muslim group based in Washington, D.C. subscribing to the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam. To draw attention to the 1973 murder of his family he organised a 1977 siege in which two of 149 hostages died. He spent the rest of his life in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to commit kidnapping while armed, second-degree murder, two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed, one count of assault with a dangerous weapon, and 24 counts of kidnapping while armed.  Early life  Khaalis was born to Seventh-day Adventist parents in Gary, Indiana as Ernest Timothy McGhee. He graduated 22nd in a class of 135 at Roosevelt High School, and he played percussion instruments and eventually converted to Roman Catholicism. As McGee, he attended Purdue University and Mid-Western Conservatory. Discharged from the U.S. Army on grounds of mental instability, he was a talented jazz drummer and played with Bud Powell, Charlie Parker, Max Roach, Billie Holiday, and J.J. Johnson in New York City. Hanafi Movement Khaalis met Tasibur Uddein Rahman and converted to Sunni Islam. Upon advice of his instructor, he infiltrated the Nation of Islam (NOI). In 1954, at the suggestion of Malcolm X, Elijah Muhammad named Khaalis the National Secretary of the NOI, a position he held until 1957. Muhammad also sent him to Chicago to head the University of Islam. In an interview, Khaalis said, \\"Elijah once said that I was next in line to him, that it was me, not Malcolm X.\\" Khaalis split with the Nation of Islam in 1958 to found a rival Islamic organisation, the Hanafi Movement. In 1968, he was arrested for attempted extortion but released on grounds of mental illness. The same year, militant blacks at Howard University formed a group called the Kokayi family; when that was disbanded, many of its members became members of Hamaas' Hanafi American Mussulman's Rifle and Pistol Club, which was given a group membership charter by the National Rifle Association. In 1971, Khaalis converted basketball player Lew Alcindor to Islam; after his conversion, Alcindor adopted the name Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Abdul-Jabbar donated a field stone mansion, 7700 16th Street NW, to serve as the headquarters of Khaalis' organization in Washington, D.C. Feud with Nation of Islam In 1972, Khaalis circulated an open letter that referred to Elijah Muhammad as a \\"lying deceiver\\" and asserted that he lured \\"former dope addicts and prostitutes to monk-like lives of sacrifice\\" that would \\"lead them to hell.\\" Khaalis claimed credit for Malcolm X's leaving the Nation of Islam. In a 1973 interview, Khaalis said he was teaching Malcolm X about Sunni Islam. \\"He used to come to my house on Long Island and we would sit in his car for hours. He would meet me after he left the temple. Never in public because he knew they were after him. He was saying the wrong things.\\" Murder of his family On January 18, 1973, Khaalis' family was murdered inside their Washington D.C home, in retaliation for letters that Khaalis had written against the Nation of Islam. Hanafi Siege To bring attention to his family's murder, Khaalis planned and led the 1977 Hanafi Siege. He was tried and convicted, receiving a sentence of 21 to 120 years in prison.  Death  Khaalis died in prison in 2003.

It is sold in three speeds: ISO 100, ISO 400 and 3200 which is a multi-speed film. To easily identify the emulsion, for each film speed, one letter in the edge marking is altered with ISO 100 being TMX, ISO 400 being TMY and ISO 3200 being TMZ. Details Eastman Kodak still manufacture the films but following its chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2012, responsibility for distribution and marketing was given to Kodak Alaris a separate company controlled by the Kodak UK pension fund. It is sold in three speeds: 100 (TMX), 400 (TMY-2) and 3200 (TMZ). The 100 and 400 speeds are given as ISO numbers, but the 3200 is sold as a multi-speed film. T-MAX 100, due to its very high resolution of 200 lines/mm, is often used when testing the sharpness of lenses. In early 2002, Kodak replaced their similarly titled Kodak T-MAX Professional Film with Kodak Professional T-MAX Film. There was also a slight change to the packaging. The main difference between the two are in the processing times. In October 2007, Kodak revised the 400-speed film, giving it the name TMY-2 instead of TMY. In the process Kodak increased the resolution from 125 lines/mm to 200 lines/mm, which is on par with their 100 speed film. The 3200 speed is actually nominally 800 to 1000 speed, but it is meant to be push-processed and the DX CAS code on the 135 film cartridges is set to 3200 speed. It has uses in surveillance and other work where it can be given a pushed exposure index between 1600 and 25000. It is also used in X-ray cameras in high-neutron environments where CCDs are unviable due to noise induced by neutron impacts, such as the National Ignition Facility. On October 1, 2012, Kodak announced the discontinuation of Kodak Professional T-MAX P3200 film due to the high expense of manufacturing it for only a limited user demand.

Like other astrocytes, it is a non-neuronal glial cell. They are not associated with Alzheimer's disease. Magnified image of Alzheimer type II astrocyte. Note the enlarged nuclei of these astrocytes.  Background  Astrocytes belong to a class of glial cells which are known to have specialized functions in the central nervous system. Among many biological roles, astrocytes are important for neuronal development, synaptic transmission, homeostasis, and neuroprotection. For example, astrocytes have many transporters and ion channels that allow for ion balance and static pH levels in order to achieve homeostasis. Although astrocytes are closely related to neurons and neuronal functions, they are not neuronal cells due to their inability to propagate action potentials. However, they are excitable cells that are able to influence synaptic transmission with cellular triggers such as calcium influx. Astrocytes can also respond to CNS injury by undergoing reactive gliosis. This acts as a neuroprotective event by upregulating intermediate filament proteins for structural cellular support. One of these proteins, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) can be used as a marker for reactive gliosis in damaged tissue. General characteristics Alzheimer type II astrocytosis occurs when the astrocyte cell is swollen and exhibits a large nucleus along with a significant nucleolus. Alzheimer type II astrocytes are visually characterized by an enlarged size and lack of cytoplasm. These astrocytes appear to be metabolically hyperactive, and contain vesicular nuclei and basophilic nucleoli.Online Medical Dictionary at CancerWeb They also contain thin marginal chromatin and excessive amounts of glycogen. Alzheimer type II astrocytes may be found in both cortical and subcortical areas, including the brain stem, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and thalamus., University of Rochester Medical Center. Retrieved 2 December 2015.  Characteristics of disease  When hyperammonemia occurs in hepatic encepalopathy, associated phenotypic changes in appearances occur in the cells as well as regulation of gene expression for proteins associated with regulation cell volume and transmission of neuronal impulses. In previous studies of hepatic encepalopathy, the presence of Alzheimer type II astrocytes corresponded to mitochondrial degeneration, as well as previously known phenotypic characteristics such as a prominent nucleolus and enlarged pale nuclei. Additionally, when these astrocytes are exposed to ammonia it causes gliopathy, the dysregulation and dysfunction of the astrocytes. This gliopathy is what is thought to cause encephalopathy in HE. Pathology Alzheimer type II astrocytes are present in hepatic encephalopathy and Wilson's disease.Blueprints Neurology, 2nd ed. The presence of Alzheimer type II astrocytes is a key indicator of hepatic encephalopathy, and may be induced by increased bodily ammonia. In hepatic encephalopathy, Alzheimer type II astrocytes are characterized by thin chromatin and increased glycogen levels. Although these astrocytes are present in this disease, it has not yet been determined if Alzheimer type II astrocytes are a pathological symptom for HE. The origin of Alzheimer type II astrocytes is unclear, although they are known to arise from astroglial cells in the development of Wilson's disease. Experiments with mice have shown that exposure to manganese leads to the development of Alzheimer's type II astrocytes. This suggests that manganism, a neurological disorder with Parkinson's-like symptoms, is caused by the development of these astrocytes through manganese poisoning. These cells are typically seen in conditions such as chronic liver disease, where hyperammonemia occurs. This is due to the presence of the enzyme glutamine synthetase, which is able to detoxify ammonia through the amidation of glutamate, producing glutamine in the process. Swelling occurs in these astrocytes due to the increased intracellular glutamine levels which induces osmotic stress on the cell and results in edema. This hypothesis is called the glutamine/osmolyte hypothesis, and has yet to be researched among scientists extensively. However, it is generally thought that ammonia-induced astrocyte swelling can be attributed to oxidative stress that glutamine can exert on the cell, as well as the creation of free radicals that may cause astrocytic damage. It is difficult for researchers to accept that excess intracellular glutamine produced in response to hyperammonemia is the direct cause of astrocytic cell swelling and therefore brain edema, however scientific data is beginning to support the effect that glutamine may have on other chemical reactions that occur in the brain such as the generation of free radicals. This area has not been fully researched yet, and more information about the mechanism by which glutamine creates radicals in the brain and the effect that this has on edema must be elucidated.

Greenwood, 52 U.S. (11 How.) 248 (1851), was a United States Supreme Court decision credited with introducing into United States patent law the concept of non-obviousness as a patentability requirement,See, e.g., (\\"We conclude that the section [¬ß 103] was intended merely as a codification of judicial precedents embracing the Hotchkiss condition, with congressional directions that inquiries into the obviousness of the subject matter sought to be patented are a prerequisite to patentability.\\"). as well as stating the applicable legal standard for determining its presence or absence in a claimed invention. The test of the Hotchkiss case may be described as: whether, at the time the claimed invention was made, the differences between the features of the claimed invention and the things that persons skilled in the relevant art already knew were such that it would have been within the level of skill of an ordinary artisan in that art to combine those known features to make the claimed invention.See, e.g., 94 (2004). More specifically, as stated in the Hotchkiss opinion, itself: > Unless more ingenuity and skill . . . were required . . . than were > possessed by an ordinary mechanic acquainted with the business, there was an > absence of that degree of skill and ingenuity which constitute essential > elements of every invention. In other words, the improvement is the work of > the skillful mechanic, not that of the inventor.Hotchkiss, 52 U.S. at 267. Background John G. Hotchkiss, John A. Davenport, and John W. Quincy obtained U.S. Patent No. 2197, on making or manufacturing knobs of potter's clay or porcelain. The patent asserted that they: > invented an improved method of making knobs for locks, doors, cabinet > furniture, and for all other purposes for which wood and metal, or other > material knobs, are used. This improvement consists in making said knobs of > potter's clay, such as is used in any species of pottery; also of porcelain; > the operation is the same as in pottery, by molding, turning, and burning > and glazing; . . . the modes of fitting them for their application to doors, > locks, furniture, and other uses, will be . . . chiefly predicated on one > principle, that of having the cavity in which the screw or shank is > inserted, by which they are fastened, largest at the bottom of its depth, in > form of a dovetail, and a screw formed therein by pouring in metal in a > fused state.Hotchkiss v. Greenwood, 52 U.S. (11 How.) 248, 264 (1851). The patented doorknob ‚Äì from U.S. Pat. No. 2197 The clay or porcelain knob, by itself, was apparently known and used in the United States prior to the invention and patent, and the shank and spindle, by which the knob is attached, including the use of the dovetail and the infusions of melted metal, were also so known and used. But the shank and spindle, the inventors contended, had never before been attached to a knob made of potter's clay or porcelain (rather than to a metal or wooden knob).Id. Lower court ruling Justice John McLean ‚Äì 1849 In Hotchkiss v. Greenwood, 12 F. Cas. 551 (C.C.D. Ohio 1848), the circuit court for Ohio upheld a jury verdict for the defendants. Justice John McLean, sitting as circuit justice, presided. The most controversial issue, subsequently the subject of the appeal, was plaintiffs' request for a charge to the jury, which McLean refused, to the effect that: > [If the] shank and spindle had never before been attached to a knob made of > potter's clay or porcelain, and if it required skill and thought and > invention to attach the said knob of clay to the metal shank and spindle, so > that the same would unite firmly, and make a solid and substantial article > of manufacture, and if the said knob of clay or porcelain so attached were > an article better and cheaper than the knob theretofore manufactured of > metal or other materials, that the patent was valid.Hotchkiss v. Greenwood, > 52 U.S. at 264. McLean, on the contrary instructed the jury: > [I]f knobs of the same form, and for the same purposes with that described > by the plaintiffs in their [patent] specifications, made of metal or other > material, had been known and used in the United States prior to the alleged > invention and patent of the plaintiffs, and if the spindle and shank, in the > form used by the plaintiffs, had before that time been publicly known and > used in the United States, and had been theretofore attached to metallic > knobs by means of the dovetail and the infusions of melted metal, as the > same is directed in the specification of the plaintiffs to be attached to > the knob of potter's clay or porcelain, so that if the knob of clay or > porcelain is the mere substitution of one material for another, and the > spindle and shank be such as were theretofore in common use, and the mode of > connecting them to the knob by dovetail be the same that was theretofore in > use in the United States, the material being in common use, and no other > ingenuity or skill being necessary to construct the knob than that of an > ordinary mechanic acquainted with the business, the patent is void, and the > plaintiffs are not entitled to recover.Id. Supreme Court ruling Justice Samuel Nelson Justice Samuel Nelson delivered the opinion for an 8-1 Court. Justice Levi Woodbury dissented. Majority opinion Counsel for the plaintiffs conceded that \\"knobs had been in use many hundred years; potter's ware and porcelain, many thousand,\\" but insisted that \\"no one ever before succeeded in uniting the clay and the iron so as to make of the two a substantial and useful article,\\" because there \\"are many difficulties in uniting them,\\" and it required skill and thought and invention to unite them.\\" Moreover, the new doorknobs were \\"cheaper and better than any like article ever before known.\\" They were a great commercial success and are replacing metal knob everywhere.Hotchkiss v. Greenwood, 52 U.S. (11 How.) 248, 264 (1851). The Court found these arguments unavailing. It was established \\"that knobs of metal, wood, etc., connected with a shank and spindle, in the mode and by the means used by the patentees in their manufacture, had been before known, and were in public use.\\" Clay doorknobs were old too. Hence, \\"the only novelty which could be claimed on their part was the adaptation of this old contrivance to knobs of potter's clay or porcelain; in other words, the novelty consisted in the substitution of the clay knob in the place of one made of metal or wood.\\"52 U.S. at 265. Therefore, McLean's charge to the jury was correct, \\"for unless more ingenuity and skill in applying the old method of fastening the shank and the knob were required in the application of it to the clay or porcelain knob than were possessed by an ordinary mechanic acquainted with the business, there was an absence of that degree of skill and ingenuity which constitute essential elements of every invention.\\" The patent is invalid because: \\"In other words, the improvement is the work of the skillful mechanic, not that of the inventor.\\"52 U.S. at 267. Dissenting opinion Justice Levi Woodbury Justice Woodbury disagreed. He focused on the last aspect of the rejected charge. The patentees sought an instruction that \\"if the said knob of clay or porcelain so attached were an article better and cheaper than the knob theretofore manufactured of metal or other materials, the patent was valid.\\" He considered the \\"ordinary mechanic\\" test incorrect for determining whether the claimed invention was patentable, \\"whereas in my view the true test of its being patentable was, if the invention was new, and better and cheaper than what preceded it.\\"52 U.S. at 268. If the new device > was in truth better and cheaper than what had preceded it for this purpose, > it would surely be an improvement. It would be neither frivolous nor > useless, and under all the circumstances it is manifest that the skill > necessary to construct it, on which both the court below and the Court here > rely, is an immaterial inquiry, or it is entirely subordinate to the > question whether the invention was not cheaper and better.52 U.S. at 269. Woodbury concluded: \\"And why is not he a benefactor to the community, and to be encouraged by protection, who invents a use of so cheap an earth as clay for knobs, or in a new form or combination, by which the community are largely gainers?\\"52 U.S. at 271‚Äì72. Post-Hotchkiss developments In the 1875 decision Reckendorfer v. Faber,92 U.S. 347 (1875). the Court considered and reaffirmed the Hotchkiss decision. The Court described the invention in these terms: > The claim is simply of the combination of the lead and india-rubber in the > holder of a drawing-pencil; in other words, the use of an ordinary lead > pencil, in one end of which, and for about one-fourth of its length, is > inserted a strip of india-rubber, glued to one side of the pencil.92 U.S. at > 355. Like Hotchkiss's doorknob, the eraser glued to a pencil was the product of mere mechanical skill and therefore unpatentable: > An instrument or manufacture which is the result of mechanical skill merely > is not patentable. Mechanical skill is one thing; invention is a different > thing. Perfection of workmanship, however much it may increase the > convenience, extend the use, or diminish expense, is not patentable.92 U.S. > at 356-57. Similarly in 1883 in Atlantic Works v. Brady, the Court used language like that of Hotchkiss in invalidating a patent: \\"It was never the object of those laws to grant a monopoly for every trifling device, every shadow of a shade of an idea, which would naturally and spontaneously occur to any skilled mechanic or operator in the ordinary progress of manufactures.\\"Atlantic Works v. Brady, 107 U.S. 192, 199‚Äì200 (1883). In the 1891 decision in Magowan v. New York Belting & Packing Co., the Court again echoed Hotchkiss ‚Äì in upholding a patent as valid: \\"[Wihat Gately did was not merely the work of a skilled mechanic, who applied only his common knowledge and experience, and perceived the reason of the failure of [previous inventions], and supplied what was obviously wanting; and that the present case involves . . . the creative work of the inventive faculty.\\"141 U.S. 332, 343 (1891). In Mast, Foos, & Co. v. Stover Mfg. Co., a few years later, the Court used the Hotchkiss \\"skillful mechanic\\" test to invalidate patent, and explained what a skilled mechanic is presumed to know ‚Äì namely, all of the relevant prior art: > The line between invention and mechanical skill is often an exceedingly > difficult one to draw, but in view of the state of the art as heretofore > shown, we cannot say that the application of this old device to a use which > was only new in the particular machine to which it was applied was anything > more than would have been suggested to an intelligent mechanic who had > before him the patents to which we have called attention. While it is > entirely true that the fact that this change had not occurred to any > mechanic familiar with windmills is evidence of something more than > mechanical skill in the person who did discover it, it is probable that no > one of these was fully aware of the state of the art and the prior devices, > but, as before stated, in determining the question of invention, we must > presume the patentee was fully informed of everything which preceded him, > whether such were the actual fact or not.177 U.S. 485, 493‚Äì94 (1900). The Court's standard for what was ordinary mechanical skill rose and fell over the years, but began to become more strict after the Great Depression and New Deal. Thus, in Cuno Engineering Corp. v. Automatic Devices Corp. in 1941, the Court veered away from Hotchkiss to invalidate an automatic cigarette lighter for cars that used a thermostat to pop out the lighter so that the user did not have to hold it in place in the socket until it heated sufficiently. In the Second Circuit, Judge Learned Hand had held the device patentable, ruling in an echo of Hotchkiss, \\"If patents are to go to those who contribute new appliances that are beyond the limited imagination of the ordinary skilled person, this invention seems to us to merit a patent.\\"Automatic Devices Corp. v. Cuno Eng'g Corp., 117 F.2d 361, 364 (2d Cir. 1941). On appeal, the Court's opinion (per Douglas, J.) applied Hotchkiss differently to the facts: > Since Hotchkiss v. Greenwood, decided in 1851, it has been recognized that > if an improvement is to obtain the privileged position of a patent more > Ingenuity must be involved than the work of a mechanic skilled in the art. . > . . The principle of the Hotchkiss case applies to the adaptation or > combination of old or well known devices for new uses.Cuno Eng'g Corp. v. > Automatic Devices Corp., 314 U.S. 84, 90‚Äì91 (1941). Then the Cuno Court revived Reckendorfer mixed with Atlantic Works mixed with Hotchkiss, by adding: > [T]he new device, however useful it may be, must reveal the flash of > creative genius not merely the skill of the calling. If it fails, it has not > established its right to a private grant on the public domain . . . We > cannot conclude that his skill in making this contribution reached the level > of inventive genius which the Constitution authorizes Congress to reward. . > . . Ingenuity was required to effect the adaptation, but no more than that > to be expected of a mechanic skilled in the art. Strict application of that > test is necessary lest in the constant demand for new appliances the heavy > hand of tribute be laid on each slight technological advance in an art.314 > U.S. at 91‚Äì92. Subsequent cases in this period used similar language.See. e.g., Jungersen v. Ostby & Barton Co., 335 U.S. 560, 566 (1949) (\\"Where centrifugal force was common as a means of introducing molten metal into the secondary mould, its use in an intermediate step to force molten wax into the primary mould was not an exemplification of inventive genius such as is necessary to render the patent valid.\\"). In 1952 came Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp.,340 U.S. 147 (1950). the last of the cases preceding the enactment of the 1952 patent act codifying Hotchkiss as the legal standard for patentability. In the A&P; case, the claimed invention was a rack or frame with three sides and no top or bottom, which could be used to pull groceries along a counter beside a cash register. All the elements of the claimed combination were old and operated in a similar fashion to how they acted in the past. The Court said: > The conjunction or concert of known elements must contribute something; only > when the whole in some way exceeds the sum of its parts is the accumulation > of old devices patentable. Elements may, of course, especially in chemistry > or electronics, take on some new quality or function from being brought into > concert, but this is not a usual result of uniting elements old in > mechanics. This case is wanting in any unusual or surprising consequences > from the unification of the elements here concerned, and there is nothing to > indicate that the lower courts scrutinized the claims in the light of this > rather severe test.340 U.S. at 152. In a concurring opinion, Justice Douglas collected a list of cases in which the Court had interpreted the Hotchkiss test for invention to require a level of skill embodying \\"inventive genius\\": * Reckendorfer v. Faber, 92 U. S. 347, 357 ‚Äì \\"Genius or invention\\" * Smith v. Whitman Saddle Co., 148 U.S. 674, 681 ‚Äì \\"Intuitive genius\\" * Potts v. Creager, 155 U.S. 597, 607 ‚Äì \\"Inventive genius\\" * Concrete Appliances Co. v. Gomery, 269 U.S. 177, 185 \\"Inventive genius * Mantle Lamp Co. of America v. Aluminum Products Co., 301 U.S. 544, 546 * Cuno Engineering Corp. v. Automatic Devices Corp., 314 U.S. 84, 91 ‚Äì \\"the flash of creative genius, not merely the skill of the calling.\\" One commentator characterized the 1930‚Äì1952 period as \\"contain[ing] the Supreme Court's most critical attitude towards patents and patent monopolies.\\"George M. Sirilla, 35 U.S.C. 103: From Hotchkiss to Hand to Rich, the Obvious Patent Law Hall-of- Famers, 32 J. 437, 487 (1999). It was immediately followed by an amendment of the patent laws to codify a \\"nonobviousness\\" standard based on Hotchkiss to replace the \\"invention\\" standard previously used and intended to limit the requirement of genius. 1952 codification of Hotchkiss As explained in the Supreme Court's opinion in Dawson Chemical Co. v. Rohm & Haas Co., the patent bar vigorously lobbied for a rollback of the Supreme Court decisions of the pre-1952 period or at least of the language that they used. Eventually it succeeded in persuading Congress to enact 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 103 as part of a codification of patent law, establishing the requirement of nonobviousness for patentability, using the language of Hotchkiss. The new section provided: > A patent for a claimed invention may not be obtained, notwithstanding that > the claimed invention is not identically disclosed as set forth in section > 102, if the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art are > such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious before > the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person having > ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains. > Patentability shall not be negated by the manner in which the invention was > made. The legislative history of new ¬ß 103 is discussed in Graham v. John Deere Co., discussed in the following section. Supreme Court rulings from Graham to KSR=Graham The first Supreme Court decision interpreting the 1952 codification of Hotchkiss was Graham v. John Deere Co.,383 U.S. 1 (1966). in which the Court explained that the inherent problem in formulating conditions for patentability \\"was to develop some means of weeding out those inventions which would not be disclosed or devised but for the inducement of a patent.\\" The Court added that \\"Hotchkiss, by positing the condition that a patentable invention evidence more ingenuity and skill than that possessed by an ordinary mechanic acquainted with the business, merely distinguished between new and useful innovations that were capable of sustaining a patent and those that were not.\\"Id. at 11. But the Hotchkiss test merely \\"laid the cornerstone of the judicial evolution\\" necessary to define the conditions for patentability.Id. The value of the Hotchkiss formulation was \\"in its functional approach to questions of patentability. In practice, Hotchkiss has required a comparison between the subject matter of the patent, or patent application, and the background skill of the calling. It has been from this comparison that patentability was in each case determined.\\"Id. at 12. According to the Graham decision, the major distinction between the language of Hotchkiss and that of ¬ß 103 \\"is that Congress has emphasized 'nonobviousness' as the operative test of the section, rather than the less definite 'invention' language of Hotchkiss that Congress thought had led to 'a large variety' of expressions in decisions and writings.\\" The meaning of ¬ß 103 is the same as that of court decisions since Hotchkiss \\"for more than 100 years\\": A claimed invention may not be patentable even if novel \\"if the difference between the new thing and what was known before is not considered sufficiently great to warrant a patent.\\"Id. at 14. The Court then explained that the statutory codification of Hotchkiss did not sweep away 100 years of precedents since 'Hotchkiss. The Court explained: > It is undisputed that this section was, for the first time, a statutory > expression of an additional requirement for patentability, originally > expressed in Hotchkiss. It also seems apparent that Congress intended by the > last sentence of ¬ß 103 to abolish the test it believed this Court announced > in the controversial phrase \\"flash of creative genius,\\" used in Cuno > Engineering Corp. v. Automatic Devices Corp.Id. at 15. But it would be erroneous, the Court further explained, to accept the contentions \\"by some of the parties and by several of the amici that the first sentence of ¬ß 103 was intended to sweep away judicial precedents and to lower the level of patentability.\\" Rather: > We believe that this legislative history, as well as other sources, show > that the revision was not intended by Congress to change the general level > of patentable invention. We conclude that the section was intended merely as > a codification of judicial precedents embracing the Hotchkiss condition, > with congressional directions that inquiries into the obviousness of the > subject matter sought to be patented are a prerequisite to patentability.Id. > at 16‚Äì17. The Court concluded its explanation of the meaning of ¬ß 103 with this instruction: > [I]t bears repeating that we find no change in the general strictness with > which the overall test is to be applied. We have been urged to find in ¬ß > 103 a relaxed standard, supposedly a congressional reaction to the > \\"increased standard\\" applied by this Court in its decisions over the last 20 > or 30 years. The standard has remained invariable in this Court.Id. at 19. Anderson's Black Rock The next Supreme Court obviousness case after Graham was Anderson's-Black Rock, Inc. v. Pavement Salvage Co., in which the Court invalidated a patent on a road-mending device.Anderson's-Black Rock, Inc. v. Pavement Salvage Co., 396 U.S. 57 (1969). The device was a combination of old devices, in which each component performed the same function as it had in the past. The Court concluded: > [W]hile the combination of old elements performed a useful function, it > added nothing to the nature and quality of the radiant-heat burner already > patented. We conclude further that to those skilled in the art the use of > the old elements in combination was not an invention by the obvious- > nonobvious standard.396 U.s. 62-63. Johnston The next Supreme Court case addressing obviousness was Dann v. Johnston,425 U.S. 219 (1976). in which the Court upheld the rejection of claims to a method of creating records of bank checks for expenditures in different categories, such as rent, wages, cost of materials, etc. so that income taxes could more readily be calculated. The Court explained that the applicable standard for nonobviousness had not been satisfied: > [T]he mere existence of differences between the prior art and an invention > does not establish the invention's nonobviousness. The gap between the prior > art and respondent's system is simply not so great as to render the system > nonobvious to one reasonably skilled in the art.425 U.S. at 230 Sakraida Three weeks after Johnston, the Court decided Sakraida v. Ag Pro, Inc. The Court instructed: :It has long been clear that the Constitution requires that there be some \\"invention\\" to be entitled to patent protection. Dann v. Johnston. As we explained in Hotchkiss v. Greenwood: ::[U]nless more ingenuity and skill . . . were required . . . than were possessed by an ordinary mechanic acquainted with the business, there was an absence of that degree of skill and ingenuity which constitute essential elements of every invention. In other words, the improvement is the work of the skillful mechanic, not that of the inventor.Sakraida v. Ag Pro, Inc., 425 U.S. 273, 279 (1976). Applying this legal standard, the Court held the patent invalid as obvious under ¬ß 103.The Supreme Court next referred to Hotchkiss in passing in Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. 141, 150 (1989), explaining that codification of Hotchkiss reflected \\"a congressional determination that the purposes behind the Patent Clause are best served by free competition and exploitation of either that which is already available to the public or that which may be readily discerned from publicly available material.\\" KSR Three decades later, the Supreme Court most recently revisited the obviousness standard. In KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc.,550 U.S. 398 (2007). the Court rejected the Federal Circuit's approach to determining obviousness as insufficiently faithful to the Hotchkiss standard as explained in Graham v. Deere. The Federal Circuit had been using a \\"rigid\\" test known as \\"the 'teaching, suggestion, or motivation' test (TSM test), under which a patent claim is only proved obvious if 'some motivation or suggestion to combine the prior art teachings' can be found in the prior art, the nature of the problem, or the knowledge of a person having ordinary skill in the art.\\"KSR, 550 U.S. at 407. \\"Throughout this Court's engagement with the question of obviousness,\\" the Court instructed, \\"our cases have set forth an expansive and flexible approach\\" based on Hotchkiss and \\"inconsistent with the way the Court of Appeals applied its TSM test here.\\"KSR, 550 U.S. at 415. The Court also criticized the Federal Circuit's treatment of patents on combinations of old elements in which the elements performed the same function as they always did, thus ignoring the emphasis in Hotchkiss on \\"functionality,\\" as reaffirmed in Graham.Id. The Court explained, quoting the A&P; Tea case: > For over a half century, the Court has held that a \\"patent for a combination > which only unites old elements with no change in their respective functions > . . . obviously withdraws what already is known into the field of its > monopoly and diminishes the resources available to skillful men.\\" Great > Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. This is a principal reason for declining to allow > patents for what is obvious. The combination of familiar elements according > to known methods is likely to be obvious when it does no more than yield > predictable results.KSR, 550 U.S. at 415-16. Applying these standards, the Court held the patent invalid for obviousness. It concluded by explaining that adherence to the Hotchkiss test is essential: \\"Were it otherwise patents might stifle, rather than promote, the progress of useful arts.\\" And it admonished that the Federal Circuit had \\"analyzed the issue in a narrow, rigid manner inconsistent with ¬ß 103 and our precedents.\\"KSR, 550 U.S. at 427‚Äì28.

Their job was to care for the multitude of animals attached to an individual military unit: cavalry horses, beasts of burden, animals used for sacrifice or animals used for food. As a result of the training above-average intelligence required of them, the soldiers who were veterinarii were given the status class of immunis. They were soldiers who held immunitas from ordinary duties as they had special tasks of their own to fulfill. As such they are listed within the group of soldiers classified as immunes in Publius Tarruntenus Paternus‚Äô De Re Militari.Though the original work did not survive, the section on immunes is included in the Digesta of Justinian (Bk 50.6.7) The title of pecuarius (or sometimes pequarius) is also associated with the veterinary service, though the exact distinction between the duties of a veterinarius and a pecuarius are uncertain. Paternus does not mention the title in his list of immunes which, unless he is grouping all animal workers together under the term veterinarii, they were of lower importance. It can be speculated that the veterinarius was concerned with the medical care of the animals while the pecuarius served in more hand-on roles as assistants. The fact that the pequarii are included within the association of soldiers connected with the hospital (valetudinarium) of Legio III Augusta at LambaesisAE 1906.9; CIL 8.2553 = 18047; ILS 2438 would suggest that they had medical responsibilities for the animals and were not just grooms or feeders.

History  Warren Row was formed by a few group of cottages on the boundaries of three estates - Hall Place, Rosehill and Park Place. St Paul's Mission, the Tin Tabernacle church, was built in 1894 and was purchased for just over ¬£100. During World War II the local chalk pits were used as an underground factory. Between 1958 and 1961 a secret bunker was built in the chalk mines as the village had been identified as a Regional Seat of Government in case of nuclear attack on London. The bunker was discovered in 1963 by a few anti-nuclear protesters, who referred to themselves as 'Spies for Peace'. It was sold in 1988, being bought by a data storage company and later also used to store wines.

Megaphone has also been prepared synthetically. Studies carried out in the 1960s demonstrated that an alcoholic extract of the ground root of Aniba megaphylla inhibited, in vitro, growth of cells derived from human carcinoma of the nasopharynx. In 1978, the active components of the extract were isolated using silica gel chromatography, characterized and named as megaphone (C22H30O6, solid), megaphone acetate (C24H32O7, oily liquid) and megaphyllone acetate (C23H28O7, oily liquid). For comparison, megaphone acetate was also produced synthetically by reacting megaphone with acetic anhydride at 50 ¬∞C for 6 hours. Stirring an alcoholic solution of megaphone (megaphone acetate), with added palladium catalyst, in hydrogen atmosphere, followed by evaporation of the solvent yields tetrahydromegaphone (tetrahydromegaphone acetate) as an oil. Millimeter-sized crystals of megaphone can be grown from an ether- chloroform solution. They have monoclinic symmetry with space group P21, lattice constants a = 0.8757 nm, b = 1.1942 nm and c = 1.0177 nm and two formula units per unit cell. Megaphone and megaphone acetate molecules are chiral and the reported extraction and synthesis procedures yielded their racemic mixtures. Megaphone acetate was also isolated from the root of Endlicheria dysodantha, another plant of Laurel family, using chromatography of ethanolic solution. It showed inhibitory activity against cells of crown gall tumor and human lung, breast and colon carcinomas.

It was established at the most northerly point of the bay, next to the town of San Roque, about halfway between the modern cities of Algeciras and Gibraltar, overlooking the sea on elevated ground at the confluence of two rivers, nowadays called Guadarranque and Cachon. According to Strabo, it was founded around 940 BC as the trading settlement of K ørt (meaning \\"city\\" in the Phoenician language; compare Carthage and Cartagena). The area had much to offer a trader; the hinterland behind Carteia, in the modern south of Andalusia, was rich in wood, cereals, oranges, lemons, lead, iron, copper and silver. Dyes were another much sought- after commodity, especially those from the murex shellfish, used to make the prized Tyrian purple. Strabo and Pomponius Mela, mention that some believe that Carteia used to be the Tartessos.Strabo, Geography, ¬ß3.2.14Pomponius Mela, Chorographia, ¬ß2.96 Pliny the Elder writes that Carteia was called by the Greeks Tartessos.Pliny the Elder, Natural History, ¬ß3.3.3 The town's strategic location meant that it played a significant role in the wars between Carthage and the Roman Republic in the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC. It may have been the site of Hamilcar's landing with his army and elephants in 237 BC, and in 206 BC the Carthaginian admiral Adherbal retreated there with the remnants of his fleet after being defeated by Gaius Laelius in the Battle of Carteia. Around 190 BC, the town was captured by the Romans. Roman and medieval period Plan of the site Livy records that in 171 BC, the Roman Senate was petitioned by a group of Romano-Spanish people, the sons of Roman soldiers and Spanish women. Although they were of Roman descent they were not regarded as Roman citizens, nor were they allowed to marry Roman citizens. The Senate responded by elevating Carteia to the status of a colonia (Roman colony) and granting around 4,000 Romano-Spanish people the right to live there and receive a grant of land on a similar basis to Roman colonists. The existing inhabitants were permitted to remain there, while all of the inhabitants were given the right to marry Roman citizens and to carry on trade with Romans. This marked a significant innovation for Rome's overseas colonies; the Carteians were the first outside Italy to receive a civic status known as the Latin Rights, halfway between being a non-citizen provincial and a full Roman citizen. Other cities in Spain were later granted a similar status. The Colonia Libertinorum Carteia (Freedmen's Colony of Carteia) prospered for another 580 years under Roman rule. It grew to become a substantial city which served as a centre for the export of local wines, shipped in amphorae fired in large kilns found on the site, and the manufacture of garum fish sauce. Carteia acquired a mint, amphitheatre, temples and port, and played a significant role in late Roman Republican affairs. Pompey made it his western base for his campaign against Mediterranean pirates in 68 BC. His sons Gnaeus and Sextus raised an army there in 45 BC before being defeated by Julius Caesar at the Battle of Munda. While Gnaeus was captured and executed, Sextus escaped via Carteia's port and fled north to the Pyrenees. Little is known of the remainder of Carteia's Roman history, but it appears to have been sacked by the Visigoths around 409 AD, by which time it was probably already in decline. Nonetheless, archaeological evidence shows that urban life continued there into the medieval period. The foundations of an early Christian basilica have been found, a Visigothic necropolis exists near one of the Roman temples, and Byzantine remains discovered at the site show its continued occupation when Carteia was incorporated into the Byzantine province of Spania during the 6th-7th centuries. In the 9th century, after the Umayyad conquest of Hispania, Islamic sources referred to the town ‚Äì which was probably not much more than a village by then ‚Äì as Qartayanna or Cartagena. The Marinids constructed a tower nearby, known today as the Torre de Cartagena, using stones from the ruined Roman walls. Rediscovery and current condition The site of Carteia was rediscovered by a young British Army officer, John Conduitt, who served in Gibraltar as commissary to the garrison between April 1713 to early 1717. He identified the city as having stood on a hill then known as El Rocadillo, which Richard Ford described in his A Handbook for Travellers in Spain (1845): Conduitt communicated his discovery to the Royal Society in London and was invited to read a paper on Carteia on his return to the capital. He did so on 20 June 1717, with Sir Isaac Newton in attendance as chair. Coincidentally, Newton was also interested in Carteia, as he was in the middle of writing his work The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms, and he invited Conduitt to his home to discuss the ancient city. It was there that Conduitt met Newton's niece, Catherine Barton. After a whirlwind courtship the two were married on 26 August 1717, though Barton was almost a decade older than Conduitt, albeit still renowned for her beauty. An early 19th-century writer, the anonymous \\"Calpensis\\", described how he had \\"often walked over the site of Carteia, attracted by the rich variety of broken pieces of marble scattered over the fields. Part of the wall enclosing the farm-house was then rudely made up of broken pillars, columns and cornices, of marble of the finest workmanship.\\" Some of the earliest excavations were carried out at the behest of the British; in 1811‚Äì12, Vice-Admiral Charles Penrose reached agreement with the estate's owners to allow amateur antiquarians from Gibraltar to \\"excavate and examine any part of its ground for antiquities.\\" The excavations found the remains of a tessellated Roman pavement, which was thought to belong to a temple, as well as foundations of Roman buildings. Although the area around Carteia was open farmland in the time of \\"Calpensis\\", it is now heavily industrialised. The site of Carteia is surrounded on three sides by an oil refinery. It was not given protection until as late as the 1960s, by which time the necropolis and city gates had been lost to encroaching development. However, the main urban area has been preserved and can be visited. A number of significant structures can still be seen, including the original Carthaginian city gate, a monumental sandstone flight of steps leading down to what was possibly the forum, a large temple, a number of houses and an extensive Roman baths. The 16th century Torre de Rocadillo can also be seen. From 1971 to 1974, excavations were carried out which found part of a bust of the Emperor Augustus and a headless statue of a man wearing a toga. The Carteia Archaeological Museum in San Roque displays archaeological finds from the site.
