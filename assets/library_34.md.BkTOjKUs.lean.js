It is a member of the azapirone class of drugs and is closely related to other azapirones like buspirone and gepirone. Medical uses=Anxiety and depression Tandospirone is most commonly used as a treatment for anxiety and depressive disorders, such as generalised anxiety disorder and dysthymia respectively. For both indications it usually takes a couple of weeks for therapeutic effects to begin to be seen, although at higher doses more rapid anxiolytic responses have been seen. It has also been used successfully as a treatment for bruxism. Other uses Tandospirone has also been tried, successfully, as an adjunctive treatment for cognitive symptoms in schizophrenic individuals. Side effects Common adverse effects include: * Dizziness * Drowsiness * Insomnia * Headache * Gastrointestinal disorders * Dry mouth * Negative influence on explicit memory function Adverse effects with unknown frequency include: * Hypotension (low blood pressure) * Dysphoria * Tachycardia * Malaise * Psychomotor impairment It is not believed to be addictive but it is known to produce mild withdrawal effects (e.g. anorexia) after abrupt discontinuation. Pharmacology Tandospirone acts as a potent and selective 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, with a Ki affinity value of 27 ± 5 nM and approximately 55 to 85% intrinsic activity. It has weak and clinically negligible affinity for the 5-HT2A (1,300 ± 200), 5-HT2C (2,600 ± 60), α1-adrenergic (1,600 ± 80), α2-adrenergic (1,900 ± 400), D1 (41,000 ± 10,000), and D2 (1,700 ± 300) receptors, and is essentially inactive at the 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, β-adrenergic, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, serotonin transporter, and benzodiazepine allosteric site of the GABAA receptor (all of which are > 100,000). There is evidence of tandospirone having low but significant antagonistic activity at the α2-adrenergic receptor through its active metabolite 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine (1-PP). Research In February 2018, a study was conducted by researchers at the Queensland University of Technology and published in the journal Scientific Reports. Researchers found that tandospirone helped reverse brain deficits caused by chronic alcohol exposure in mice.

Marketed as Tacitin by Ciba-Geigy, it is different from most sedative drugs because in most clinical trials it does not produce respiratory depression, but actually stimulates the respiratory system. As a result, when compared to other sedative and anxiolytic drugs such as benzodiazepines like diazepam, it is a safer form of tranquilizing. However, when co-administered with other drugs that cause respiratory depression, like morphine, it can cause increased respiratory depression. Medically, benzoctamine is used as a treatment for anxious outpatients to control aggression, enuresis, fear, and minor social maladjustment in children. While it is a relatively new anti-anxiety drug, its popularity is increasing as a result of it being able to have comparable anxiolytic and sedative effects to other medications without their potentially fatal respiratory depressive side effects. Its anxiolytic effects are most similar to diazepam, another anxiolytic, but unlike diazepam, benzoctamine has antagonistic effects on epinephrine, norepinephrine, and appears to reduce serotonin turnover. While little is understood about how it carries out its effects, studies point to reduced serotonin, epinephrine, and norepinephrine as partial causes of its pharmacologic and behavioral effects. Animal studies have shown sedative hypnotic drugs tend to show dependency in animals, but benzoctamine has been shown to not be addictive. Other animal studies also point to the drug as a possible mechanism by which to reduce blood pressure through the adrenergic system. Chemically, benzoctamine belongs to the class of compounds called dibenzobicyclo-octodienes. It is a tetracyclic compound, consisting of four rings in a three dimensional configuration, and is very closely related structurally to the tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA) maprotiline, differing only in the length of their side chain. Medical uses=Anxiety Benzoctamine’s main clinical use is for the treatment of anxiety, and evidence points to it being as effective as other clinical anxiety drugs, in particular diazepam. In the treatment of symptoms of mild anxiety due to psychoneurosis, a daily dosage of 30 to 80 g of benzoctamine was shown to be just as effective as 6–20 mg of diazepam. In another study one group of patients were given 10g of benzoctamine three times a day, while another group was given 5 mg of diazepam, and the treatments were equivalent. While these studies point to higher doses of benzoctamine being needed to exert the same pharmacological effects, the drug is still popular because of its ability to act as an anxiolytic without producing the common respiratory depression associated with other sedative drugs. Some studies have even shown that it stimulates the respiratory system. =Benzoctamine and sodium amylobarbitone= In a study used to compare benzoctamine to sodium amylobarbitone as a sleep promoter, it was found that during administration of both drugs, patients reported that their sleep was less restless, and drowsiness was diminished. The study further showed that while sodium amylobarbitone caused withdrawal rebound symptoms, benzoctamine did not. It was also found that benzoctamine reduced plasma corticosteroid hormone levels. There is a relationship between anxiety and adreno-corticosteroid activity, with raised levels commonly being reported as an indication of stress. The study showed that benzoctamine, a drug reported to reduce anxiety, was also able to reduce the hormones that potentially cause it. This points to a phenomenon often seen within pharmacology where drugs intended for other uses often have far-reaching and rarely considered effects. =Benzoctamine vs. chlordiazepoxide in anxiety neurosis= Benzoctamine has been found to have the same efficacy as chlordiazepoxide when treating anxiety neurosis Sleep sedation While benzoctamine was made to be an alternative to the benzodiazepine line of anxiolytic drugs, other uses for the drug have been discovered. Due to benzoctamine's ability to tranquilize without causing respiratory depression, scientists are moving forward with studies that test its sedative effects in patients with respiratory failure. In one study that used benzoctamine in a clinical setting, researchers showed that the use of benzoctamine for sedation did not result in changes in forced expiratory volume in one second or carbon dioxide partial pressure PCO2. This confirmed previous statements that claimed the drug did not cause respiratory failure. The main goal of this clinical study was to confirm the findings of another study that showed benzoctamine did not reduce CO2 responsiveness, but instead increased the ventilatory response to CO2. There are usually many risks associated with using sedatives on patients who are suffering from respiratory failure, which has made it difficult to administer tranquillizing medications in situations when they are desirable. It is not known why this drug is safe and its benzodiazepine cousins are not, but a possible explanation for this phenomenon might come from its similarity in structure to tricyclic antidepressants, which have also been shown to not cause respiratory failure. While further experimentation is necessary, this study points to benzoctamine’s possible consideration for sedation in respiratory failure patients. Other usesHypertension = A possible treatment for hypertension is blocking peripheral vascular seretonergic neurons or alpha- adrenergic neurons on postsynaptic cell sites. One study showed that benzoctamine, a serotonin and alpha-adrenergic antagonist, does not reduce blood pressure through a seretonin mechanism but does reduce blood pressure by antagonizing alpha-adrenergic receptors in rats. Rats were given 10 mg of benzoctamine and drops in their blood pressure were approximately 30 mm Hg. The researchers further confirmed that serotonin antagonism was not sufficient to reduce blood pressure by using the highly selective serotonin antagonist 1-(1-naphthyl)-piperazine, which was not able to decrease the blood pressure of the rats. These studies have yet to be repeated in humans. Side effects=Common side effects • Drowsiness • Dry mouth • Headache • Dizziness Serotonin turnover Studies have shown that benzoctamine decreases the rate of turnover of serotonin. Scientists confirmed these results and proposed that the method of action was inhibition of serotonin uptake since the drug also blocked the serotonin depleting action of extra-neuronal monoamine transporters (EMT). This would lead to increased stimulation of serotonin receptors through a negative feed back mechanism, eventually decreasing serotonin out put. However, the study points out that other studies have shown that drugs combined with EMT cause a lowering of body temperature that in fact results in a decrease in 5HT turnover. This means that body temperature effects cannot be ruled out. Pharmacology Not much is understood about how benzoctamine produces its anti-anxiety effects, but rat studies have shown that the possible mechanism of action is by way of increased turnover of cathecholamines. In addition to serotonin it has also been shown to decrease epinephrine, dopamine, and norepinephrine turnover by antagonizing their receptors. When given intravenously in doses of 20–40 mg there are no significant differences in efficacy. Oral doses exceeding 10 mg three times daily do not increase the effects of the drug. Assuming serotonin postsynaptic antagonism is the main mechanism by which benzoctamine carries out its effects, studies have shown it to have a half maximal inhibitory concentration(IC50) value of 115 mM at the serotonin receptor. Pharmacokinetics Benzoctamine can be injected directly into the blood or given as tablets. When given as tablets, it is given in doses of 10 mg three times daily. And when given intravenously, patients are given the drug at a rate of 5 mg/minute until 20–40 mg of drug has been injected. Benzoctamine can be analyzed as the 3H acetyl derivative and N-methyl metabolite it gets broken down into using radioactive analysis. Benzoctamine has a half-life of 2–3 hours, with a bioavailability of 100% when given intravenously and around > 90% when given orally. The average time to achieve peak plasma concentrations is 1 hour and the volume of distribution for a 70 kg person is 1-2 l/kg. Other studies=Alcohol and benzoctamine Benzoctamine, like other psychoactive drugs has the ability to potentiate the effects of other drugs. However, a motor skill study looking at benzoctamine's capacity to potentiate the inhibitory effects of alcohol showed no significant decreases in motor skill function due to benzoctamine being administered with alcohol. Morphine and benzoctamine Though benzoctamine does not potentiate the effects of alcohol, studies have shown it can potentiate the respiratory depression seen with morphine in rats, while also reducing morphine's analgesic effects. Dependency Monkey studies looking at the dependence liability of several sedative drugs showed that benzoctamine was a dependence- free drug, while pentobarbital, alcohol, chloroform, meprobamate, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and oxazolam were not. Benzoctamine vs. chlordiazepoxide in serotonin turnover In a rat study looking at the effects of benzoctamine and chlordiazepoxide on serotonin turnover, rats treated with drug were found to have elevated levels of [14C]-5HT, indicating a decrease in serotonin turnover.

It produces antidepressant-like effects in rats. However, captodiamine is unique among antidepressant-like drugs in that it increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the hypothalamus but not in the frontal cortex or hippocampus. This unique action may be related to its ability to attenuate stress-induced anhedonia and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) signaling in the hypothalamus. Synthesis The oxygen atom in these molecules can in many cases be dispensed with as well; substitution of sulfur for nitrogen affords a molecule whose salient biologic properties are those of a sedative and tranquilizer.

Bred and owned by 79-year-old Warren B. Williamson and trained by Carla Gaines, Nashoba's Key went from an untested 4-year-old maiden to a Grade I winner in less than 6 months. With her first three starts on turf with jockey Garrett Gomez aboard, she earned her first big win in the June 3, 2007, Milady Breeders' Cup Handicap on Hollywood Park Racetrack's new synthetic Cushion Track. Seventeen-year-old jockey Joseph Talamo drove her to a surprise victory against Grade I winners Hystericalady and Balance in this race. A month later, on July 7, 2007, Talamo rallied Nashoba's Key to her first Grade I victory in the Vanity Handicap, again defeating Balance and Hystericalady on Hollywood's All Weather Track. Nashoba's Key (with jockey Joseph Talamo) after crossing the finish line to take 1st place in the 2007 Clement L. Hirsch Handicap. On August 5, 2007, the filly won the Grade II Clement L.

On Oct. 27, 2007, Nashoba's Key ran in the prestigious Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf at Monmouth Park and received her first defeat. After a good break, the filly was forced to take an inward position along the rail amid a traffic jam of other horses on the rain-soaked turf. Jockey Joseph Talamo said, \\"She was on the worst part of the turf the whole way around there. It was probably 6 inches deep along the rail.\\" Nashoba's Key had gone off as the second favorite, but was unable to rally enough to catch the leaders along the stretch and finished 4th, two lengths behind the surprise winner Lahudood. Nonetheless, Nashoba's Key was awarded California Horse of the Year honors by the California Thoroughbred Breeders' Association for the 2007 season. Nashoba's Key made her 2008 racing debut on January 26 in the Sunshine Millions Filly & Mare Turf at Santa Anita Park. Sent off as the 3-5 favorite with jockey Joseph Talamo aboard, the 5-year-old mare was unable to catch the leader, Quite a Bride, down the stretch and finished 1 lengths behind, placing 2nd. On March 9, 2008, Nashoba's Key won the GI Santa Margarita Invitational Handicap at Santa Anita by over four lengths under jockey Garrett Gomez, which pushed her earnings past the $1 million mark.

She was formerly the Senior Vice President of the Impact Knockouts Division. She is the former wife of professional wrestler and Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle and the current wife of Impact and GFW founder and wrestler Jeff Jarrett. Professional wrestling career= World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001, 2004)  Karen was never involved in a storyline of World Wrestling Entertainment while her then-husband Kurt Angle was under contract. She herself was never under contract, but did briefly appear at Unforgiven 2001 as a part of the big celebration with the Angle family following Kurt Angle's victory over Stone Cold Steve Austin for the WWF Championship. She also made an appearance on the WrestleMania XX DVD set in a bonus segment regarding Kurt Angle.  Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2007–2008)  Karen and Kurt Angle watching a match at ringside during an episode of Impact! Karen Angle was introduced in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in the summer of 2007 when Samoa Joe and Kurt Angle were feuding for an all-at-once Triple Crown Championship (Kurt held the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, and Joe held the TNA X Division and TNA World Tag Team Championship). Karen was supposedly wanting to divorce Kurt, claiming that he was emotionally abusive toward both her and their children. At the Hard Justice pay-per-view, however, Karen betrayed Joe during his match with her husband, resulting in Kurt winning the Triple Crown (thus turning her heel). In the following weeks, her character began to develop into a manipulative vamp, such as when she claimed that Sting slapped her at No Surrender when, in fact, he had not. This led to Kurt and Sting losing the Tag Team titles to Team Pacman after Kurt executed the Olympic slam on Sting. Another feud then erupted between Kurt Angle and Sting in which Sting had Karen arrested for violating a restraining order and Kurt stalking Sting's son. At Genesis, Karen persuaded A.J. Styles and Tomko into helping Kurt retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship during the tag team match for the title. In late 2007, Karen began to have issues with Booker T's wife Sharmell, claiming there was only room for one \\"queen\\" in TNA (a direct reference to Booker T's and Sharmell's last WWE gimmick, where they were self- proclaimed royalty after Booker won the 2006 King of the Ring tournament). This led to a catfight at the December 12 TNA Impact! tapings. Karen suffered a broken foot after jumping from the apron after an in-ring segment. She did not miss any time as a result of TNA's taping schedule. On the February 14, 2008 episode of Impact!, Karen was scheduled to renew her wedding vows to Kurt, but in the storyline, she was pronounced married to A.J. Styles after the priest, who had just been knocked down by Kevin Nash, awoke and married the two, mistaking Styles for Kurt. Kurt then started to emotionally attack Karen for not ending the \\"marriage\\". Later in the year, she proposed to separate from Kurt Angle (kayfabe) which Kurt Angle supported to \\"concentrate on his upcoming match with Samoa Joe at Lockdown\\". Since then, hints of a relationship with A.J. were given, after Kurt continued to ignore Karen, even having her ejected from her ringside seat at Lockdown. On the May 22, 2008 episode of Impact!, Kurt Angle asked Karen to the ring to forgive him for not performing his \\"husbandly duties\\" and to ask her to come home. Karen then left a begging Kurt in the ring after he pleaded for a second chance. At the end of Impact!, Karen came to the ring to the aid of A.J. Styles who was being beaten four on one by Booker T, Team 3D, and Tomko. After being ejected, Karen ran to the back to enlist Kurt's aid, who came out with a chair. Kurt threatened the four with the chair, only to turn around and see his estranged wife hugging a bloody AJ. Kurt freaked and hit AJ with the chair, thus prompting the four back in the ring. Team 3D held Karen up while Kurt held AJ's head, yelling at Karen, telling her this was all her fault. Kurt is quoted as saying to Karen, \\"This is your fault! You deceived me!\\" On the May 29, 2008 edition of Impact! after being assaulted backstage before his entrance, A.J. ran to the ring to help Karen only to be beat down by Team 3D and Kurt Angle for the second week in a row. Christian Cage came to the ring to aid Styles but was viciously assaulted for his trouble as well. It was then announced that at the Slammiversary pay-per-view it would be A.J. Styles one-on-one with Kurt Angle. Karen then interfered helping A.J. Styles win his match against Kurt Angle at Slammiversary 2008, turning her face again. Shortly thereafter, Angle was given her own interview segment, Karen's Angle on iMPACT. Her first interview was Kaz on July 24, 2008. On the October 9, 2008 episode of Impact!, it was announced that Karen had to step down as the host of Karen's Angle to focus on her family. Her profile and Knockout photos were taken off TNA's official website, but were put back up a few days later...  Return to TNA (2011, 2015)  On January 10, 2011, TNA announced that Karen would be making her return to the promotion on the January 13 edition of Impact!, appearing beside her new husband Jeff Jarrett, who has recently been feuding with Kurt Angle. In her return appearance Karen confronted Angle just as he was about to attack Jeff, told him that she would not allow him to ruin their personal lives and promised to tell all about their divorce the following week. The following week Karen slapped Kurt, providing a distraction which allowed Jeff to beat him down. On February 13 at Against All Odds Jeff defeated Kurt in a singles match and as a result Angle was forced to walk Karen down the aisle, when she and Jarrett renewed their wedding vows on the March 3 edition of Impact!. On March 3 Angle proceeded to destroy the wedding set with an axe and forced wedding guest, New York Jet Bart Scott to tap out with the ankle lock. On May 15 at Sacrifice, Angle and Chyna, whom Angle had recently brought to the promotion to negate Karen, defeated the Jarretts in a mixed tag team match, after Karen submitted to Chyna. Due to a storyline injury, Karen missed the culmination of Jeff's and Angle's feud at Slammiversary IX and the following Impact Wrestling, which led to the defeated Jarrett leaving the company for a tour of Mexico. On June 18, Karen appeared beside her husband at Mexican promotion Lucha Libre AAA World Wide's (AAA) biggest event of the year, Triplemanía XIX, and provided a distraction, which led to Jeff defeating El Zorro for the AAA Mega Championship. On the September 1 edition of Impact Wrestling!, Eric Bischoff named Karen the new Commissioner of the Knockouts Division. On the October 20 edition of Impact Wrestling, Jarrett aligned herself with Gail Kim and Madison Rayne. On the December 15 edition of Impact Wrestling, TNA's authority figure, Sting, fired both Jarretts from TNA as a result of Jeff losing to Jeff Hardy at Final Resolution. Four years later, Karen, alongside her husband Jeff returned to Impact Wrestling on the June 24, 2015 tapings. Jeff announced that he would be the first entrant in the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary 2015. Karen turned heel on the August 26 episode of Impact Wrestling when she revealed that she orchestrated the attacks on TNA General Manager Bully Ray and Drew Galloway. A team of 5 wrestlers from GFW fought against a team of 5 from TNA in a Lethal Lockdown match to determine complete control of TNA. GFW was unsuccessful when Drew Galloway pinned Brian Myers, thus exiling GFW from TNA.  Family Wrestling Entertainment (2013)  On October 12, 2013, Jarrett appeared at Family Wrestling Entertainment's Grand Prix, where she was named Commissioner.  Global Force Wrestling (2015–2017)  She is the co-founder of Global Force Wrestling.

What ties these tracks together besides the musician's lyrical savvy (think scholarly, yet street lean and mean from the Gil Scott-Heron old school) and exceptional ear is almighty rhythm, as a cipher, as a shape-shifting ever- present in a musical meld that touches on everything from the Delta blues and Storyville to vanguard rock, vintage R&B;, classic and futuristic pop, tough urban soul, and of course, the rainbow of sounds and beats that is hip-hop. A strange and unwieldy cast of characters were assembled for this set, including guitarist Dave Tronzo, avant jazz violin legend Leroy Jenkins, Marc Anthony Thompson (aka Chocolate Genius), Brazilian samba guitar genius Vinicius Cantuaria, Rob Hyman from the Hooters (who wrote \\"Time After Time\\" for Cyndi Lauper), and backing vocalists such as Irene Datcher, Stephanie McKay, and Helga Davis. Co-produced with help from Stewart Lerman (Black 47, Dar Williams), Rux assembles a montage of sounds that weave through and around one another in a constant effluvium of urban music that continually references and overwrites its history politically, socially, and spiritually. On the opener, \\"I Got a Name,\\" with its shimmering African juju guitars that open onto a body of dubbed-out, compressed pianos, multi-layered percussion, and throbbing bass lines, Rux sings, raps, and chants his way through to establish an identity in the African diaspora as it stands tall as its own signifier, the American urban landscape. On \\"Eleven More Days,\\" the contrast of generations, religions, races, and social statures is played out on subway platforms, playgrounds, slam apartments, prisons, and in the streets. While Rux iterates the terrain and circumstances in his landscape, a stunning gospel refrain sung by a chorus of female voices emphasizes the place of intersection, the place of hope, the place of loss, and even deliverance while contrasting contrapuntal synthetic rhythms slip around bass lines and indeterminate sounds. And while these two selections provide a view, they are by no means the only ones. Everywhere polyrhythmic strategies, multivalent pop textures, and smoky roots musics fold into one another, sometimes clashing but more often just touching and caressing one another before they move on to get Rux's poetic depth of field across, and that field never cancels anything out of its articulation, except perhaps hopelessness. Apothecary RX is indeed a prescription: musically it opens wide the current closed scene of alliteration, endless insider referencing, and production conceits by sounding organic and visceral without ever bogging down in its own ambition. Lyrically, it offers voices, many of them, sometimes speaking simultaneously, sometimes out of the depths of solitude, and they speak from reportorial detachment as well as from pain and joy and the desire to transcend as well as be delivered. Rux has created something off the boards here, unclassifiable, truly beautiful and moving. It is as unrelenting in its excellence as it is in its ambition.\\" Thom Jurek AllMusic .

The scandal's ability to push otherwise cautious and conservative lenders into increasingly risky practices has prompted some comparisons to later financial crises including the 2007–2008 subprime mortgage crisis. Alt URL The scandal involved the Allied Crude Vegetable Oil company in New Jersey, owned by Anthony \\"Tino\\" De Angelis, a former commodities broker. De Angelis had been in trouble with the law previously for supplying schools with beef from uncertified sources under the National School Lunch Act. Fraud De Angelis was awarded a contract with Food for Peace, a federal program which sold excess food stocks to poor countries. He discovered that he could obtain loans based upon Allied's fraudulently-inflated inventory of salad oil. Ships supposedly full of salad oil for Allied would dock and inspectors would certify the cargo, allowing Allied to post the oil as collateral and obtain millions of dollars in bank loans. In reality, the ships tanks contained only water, with a few feet of salad oil floating on top to trick inspectors. When inspectors audited Allied's facilities, the company would transfer the same oil stock from tank to tank to fool the inspectors while entertaining them during lunch. In all, Allied posted 1.8 billion pounds of soybean oil as collateral to fraudulently obtain $180 million in loans, when the actual stock was a mere 110 million pounds.  Impact  The scandal was exposed when the Russian soybean market did not open up, and soybean prices fell drastically as a result, causing the investors to attempt to cash in. American Express stock dropped more than 50% as a result, which cost the company nearly $58 million. De Angelis was convicted of fraud and conspiracy charges in connection with the scandal and served seven years in prison, gaining his release in 1972.

It was constructed by Kansas City Power and Light in 1931 as a way to promote new jobs in Downtown Kansas City. Since then, the Art Deco building has been a prominent part of Kansas City's skyline. The structure was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River upon its completion after succeeding the Smith TowerSmith Tower until the completion of the Space Needle in 1962.Space Needle The east façade of the building faces the Power & Light District (which bears its name), and the building's iconic lantern appears on promotional materials and signage for the district and even Kansas City as a whole. History The building was designed by the Kansas City architecture firm of Hoit, Price and Barnes, which also designed Municipal Auditorium and 909 Walnut. Rumor for years said the original plans included a twin building to be paired on the immediate west side of the building, but the second tower was never built due to the effects of the Great Depression on local real estate prices. This was debunked in 2013 by local architect Dan Hicks who reviewed plans and interviewed Clarence Kivett, a well known architect working for Hoit, Price and Barnes at the time of the building design.http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/blog/2013/12/the-mystery-at-the- power-light-building.html?ana=e_du_pub&s;=article_du&ed;=2013-12-19&page;=all The west side of the building has no windows because it was meant to be a firewall if there was a structure building built immediately next to it, plus the elevator shafts are along that side of the building. The Power and Light Building, at 34 stories, was Missouri's tallest habitable structure from 1931 until the completion of One U.S. Bank Plaza in St. Louis in 1976. Kansas City Power & Light Co. left the building in 1991. In 2010 Kansas City selected the area adjacent to the Power and Light Building as a potential location for a hotel and convention center, to fulfill a need for the city. However, the city only received two proposals from property developers for a convention hotel at the site. The city considered the two proposals it received in 2011 as lackluster and were considering reopening the bidding process for a different downtown location. The building lost its last tenant, BNIM, a Kansas City- based architecture and planning firm, on September 2, 2014. The 36-story Power & Light building began a conversion into an apartment tower in October 2014. The project, led by NorthPoint Development of Riverside, which has now been completed includes 210 apartments in the historic tower, with an additional 81 units constructed wrapping around and built above a new 500 stall parking garage serving the building. The building lobby was converted into a premier event space holding up to 500 guests. The conversion made it Missouri's tallest residential-only building. Lighting The Kansas City Power and Light Building is crowned by an ornate Art Deco lantern, which features prismatic glass panels concealing red-orange lights that glow each evening at sunset. Originally, each recessed setback of the building also held multicolor flickering flood lights that dazzled nighttime viewers with the impression of blazing flames.The Kansas City Chapter of the American Institute of Architects (1979), Kansas City, \\"N° 52: Kansas City Power and Light Building,\\" Kansas City, Missouri: KCAIA, p. 71 Today, LED floodlights rotate through an abundance of colors and dazzle onlookers.

Louisiana, 471 U.S. 1080 (1985), was a case denied for hearing by the United States Supreme Court in 1985. The case is famous for Justice Brennan's dissent from the denial of certiorari, joined by Justice Marshall, arguing that the death penalty is always unconstitutional.  Background  Louisiana State Penitentiary, where Glass was confined and executed Jimmy L. Glass (May 27, 1962 - June 12, 1987) was an American convicted murderer who was sentenced to death by the state of Louisiana. Glass originally hailed from Arkansas. He was a high school dropout and had a criminal record. With fellow inmate Jimmy C. Wingo (March 14, 1952 - June 16, 1987), Glass escaped from the Webster Parish, Louisiana Jail in December 1982 and, during their escape, they killed Newt Brown (born 1927) and his wife, Erlene Nealy Brown (born 1931), at their home on Christmas Eve in Dixie Inn outside Minden. The Browns' son, Gary Lamar Brown, was the son-in-law of Judge Charles A. Marvin (1929-2003) of the Louisiana Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit, based in Shreveport. Glass and Wingo were soon arrested. Both were sentenced to death in the electric chair. According to then Louisiana's law, the only authorized method of execution was the electric chair. Glass and his lawyers argued that executions by electrocution violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, because causing to pass through the body of the person convicted a current of electricity of sufficient intensity to cause death, and the application and continuance of such current through the body of the person convicted until such person is dead and electrocution causes the gratuitous infliction of unnecessary pain and suffering and does not comport with evolving standards of human dignity.  Opinion of the Court  The court denied certiorari, thereby allowing the lower court's decision to stand. Justice William J. Brennan (joined by Justice Thurgood Marshall) dissented from the denial of certiorari. In his dissent, Brennan reiterated his \\"belief that the 'physical and mental suffering' inherent in any method of execution is so 'uniquely degrading to human dignity' that, when combined with the arbitrariness by which capital punishment is imposed, the trend of enlightened opinion, and the availability of less severe penological alternatives, the death penalty is always unconstitutional.\\" Brennan's dissent is known for its gruesome depiction of electrocution: \\"Th[e] evidence suggests that death by electric current is extremely violent and inflicts pain and indignities far beyond the 'mere extinguishment of life.' Witnesses routinely report that, when the switch is thrown, the condemned prisoner 'cringes,' 'leaps,' and 'fights the straps with amazing strength.' 'The hands turn red, then white, and the cords of the neck stand out like steel bands.' The prisoner's limbs, fingers, toes, and face are severely contorted. The force of the electric current is so powerful that the prisoner's eyeballs sometimes pop out and 'rest on [his] cheeks.' The prisoner often defecates, urinates, and vomits blood and drool. \\" Brennan also concluded that electrocution is \\"\\"nothing less than the contemporary technological equivalent of burning people at the stake.\\"  Subsequent developments  The Court, by majority 5-4, found that electrocution as an authorized method of executions is constitutional. Glass was electrocuted on June 12, 1987 at the age of twenty-five. His accomplice, Jimmy Wingo, was executed four days later, on June 16, 1987. It was said that Glass was grinning as he was confined in the electric chair. His last words were \\"I'd rather be fishing\\". Despite the failure of Glass v. Louisiana, electrocution has now been retired as a method of execution in most US states and none of the states retaining it uses it as their primary execution method.

St. Theresa C.S.S. is a uniform school.  Administration  In 2012, there were over 70 teaching staff, six support staff and two administrators, led by a principal and vice- principal.  Academics  All students who attend St. Theresa are taught under the Ontario Secondary Curriculum. From 2002 to 2004, St. Theresa had success rates below 80%. In the 2007 school year, the success rate was up to 92%.\\"Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test Results Continue to Improve\\", Algonquin And Lakeshore Catholic District School Board, June 13, 2007 In a 2012 report from the Fraser Institute that ranked Ontario secondary schools in terms of academics for the 2011–2012 school year, St. Theresa scored 6.1/10, ranking it 378th out of the 725 Ontario secondary schools included in the report. Out of the other high schools in the Algonquin and Lakeshore Catholic District School Board, St. Theresa Catholic Secondary School received the lowest score in terms of academic achievement, behind St. Paul Secondary School, which scored 6.8/10. The decline in academics in recent years is a startling one, as St. Theresa had maintained an exceptionally high academic standing in years past, as it ranked highest in the school board during the 2010–2011 school year with a score of 8.6/10. Despite this, St. Theresa Catholic Secondary School's score was still above the provincial average.http://ontario.compareschoolrankings.org/secondary/SchoolsCompare.aspx The Fraser Institute's results for the 2013 school year noted that STCSS had made significant improvements, rising to a score of 6.7/10, ranking it 273rd out of 740 Ontario secondary schools.http://ontario.compareschoolrankings.org/secondary/St_Theresa_Catholic_Secondary_School/Belleville/Report_Card.aspx The score was higher than the provincial average of around 6.0-6.1/10. In terms of school board rankings, STCSS tied for the lowest score in the ALCDSB with Holy Cross Catholic Secondary School in Kingston. The gains of the 2013 school year were not built upon in 2014, as the Fraser Institute's results marked that the school had declined to 6.2/10, bringing it down to rank 392nd out of the 749 Ontario secondary schools. This score just surpassed the provincial average of around 6/10 and making it the lowest ranking secondary school in the ALCDSB, with the second lowest being St. Paul with a score of 6.8/10. The 2015 school year proved to yield only greater decline, with STCSS scoring 5.7/10 and ranking 415th out of 676 Ontario secondary schools, scoring below the provincial average of about 6.0. It once again was the lowest scoring secondary school in the ALCDSB, with the next lowest score being St. Paul with a 6.5 and ranking 289/676. From 2011–2015, STCSS' score fell by 2.9 points, marking an era of academic decline in the 2010s. The 2016 school year reinforced the trend of declining academics at St. Theresa Catholic Secondary School, as STCSS scored 5.5/10 and ranked 493rd out of 740 Ontario secondary schools, its worst score of the decade and possibly of its entire history and well below the provincial average of around 6.0. It tied with Holy Cross Catholic Secondary School for the lowest scoring secondary school in the ALCDSB, with the next lowest being Nicholson with a 6.2/10 and ranking 371/740. Nicholson, Regiopolis Notre Dame, and Holy Cross all experienced significant decreases along with STCSS, Holy Cross' being the worst with a drop from 7.4/10 to 5.5/10. The 2017 school year resulted in a slight improvement for STCSS, the first increase in its ranking since 2013. It scored 5.6/10 and ranked 477th out of 747 Ontario secondary schools, still well below the provincial average of around 6.0. It retained its place as the lowest ranking secondary school in the Algonquin and Lakeshore Catholic District School Board, with the next lowest being Holy Cross Catholic Secondary School with 6.3/10. STCSS remained the only secondary school in the ALCDSB to rank below the provincial average.  Facilities  St .Theresa is equipped with a range of athletic facilities. Because of the school's close location to the Yardmen Arena, that is used for the Canadian Hockey Skills Academy classes. Because of the growing student population a new wing was built, housing a new art studio, office and life skills room. The wing was officially opened during the 2005 school year.http://www.alcdsb.on.ca/mediareleases/2005_06/dec05/sttheresa.pdf The school property includes two soccer fields. A walkway to the Quinte Health and Wellness Centre parking lot provides students with access to further sports facilities.

She was constructed for the U.S. Navy during World War II and her assignment was to provide liquids, such as fuel or water, to ships in the forward battle areas. She survived this dangerous task and returned home post-war with two battle stars to her credit. The fourth Navy ship to be named Severn, she was laid down under Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 727) on 24 November 1943 by the Bethlehem-Sparrows Point Shipyard, Inc., Sparrows Point, Maryland; launched on 31 May 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Harold B. Hinton; and delivered and commissioned on 19 July 1944, Lt. Comdr. Owen Rees in command.  Pacific Theatre operations  Following shakedown in Chesapeake Bay, Severn departed the U.S. East Coast for the Panama Canal and duty as a fresh water carrier in the Pacific. Assigned to ServRon 8, she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 8 September and at Eniwetok on 22 September. There she discharged her cargo into YO's; and, on the 28th, sailed for the Admiralties. At Manus, on 3 October, she commenced watering amphibious craft of the U.S. 7th Fleet preparing for the Leyte invasion; and, on 13 October, got under way for Hollandia, whence she sailed for Leyte Gulf on the 18 October. Philippine Islands invasion  On 23 October the Battle for Leyte Gulf began; and, as that day turned into the 24th, Severn entered the gulf. After daylight, she moved into San Pedro Bay. An hour later, she underwent her first air attack; and, on the 25th, began discharging fresh water.  Missed by a bomb from a plane  Severn and , in April 1944. Through the daily air attacks of the next few weeks, Severn continued to provide U.S. 7th Fleet units with water. By November, the attacks were down to two a day and were usually broken up by friendly aircraft. But, on the 24th, an enemy plane penetrated the CAP cover and released a bomb aimed at the water carrier. The bomb missed Severn, but hit PC-1124 then receiving water. In December, Severn returned to Manus; took on more water, clothing, dry provisions, and lube oil; loaded an LCVP and 2 jeeps at Hollandia; then returned to the Philippines in time to support the landings in Lingayen Gulf. Arriving in that gulf on 13 January 1945, she distributed water and fuel oil through the 26th; then returned to San Pedro Bay. From Leyte, she proceeded back to the Admiralties; and, on 14 February, got under way for the Western Carolines.  South Pacific operations  During March, Severn filled her cargo tanks with water at Guam and offloaded at Ulithi—into ships staging for the Okinawa campaign. In April, she continued to focus her operations on Ulithi, which she left only to rendezvous with U.S. 5th Fleet units at sea to return to the Marianas to refill her cargo tanks. In May, with the arrival of at Ulithi, she commenced roughly triangular operations which took her from the Carolines to the Admiralties to the Marianas and back to the Carolines—taking on potable water at Manus and Guam and discharging it into water carriers and small craft at Saipan and Ulithi.  End-of-war activity  In August, Severn moved up to Okinawa to discharge water to ships in Buckner Bay and in the Hagushi anchorage. After the end of hostilities, she remained at Okinawa, and-during September, October, and November, she shuttled water from Samar to the Ryūkyūs. In December, she carried water to distributing ships at Sasebo, Kagoshima, and Wakayama, Japan; and, on the 27th, sailed for the United States.  Nuclear testing at Bikini  Severn arrived at San Pedro, California, on 10 January 1946. Overhaul followed; and, in May, she sailed for the Marshalls. There, into October, she provided fresh water to units of Joint Task Force 1 during Operation Crossroads, the atomic test series conducted that summer at Bikini Atoll. She then returned to the United States; and, in December, assumed the duties of an oiler and initially transported Navy special fuel and diesel fuel between U.S. West Coast ports.  Post-war runs  At mid-month, Severn sailed for Japan where she joined ServRon 3 and commenced shuttling fuel between Japanese and Korean ports. In February 1947, she was transferred to Persian Gulf runs; and, into July, moved fuel from Ras at Tanura to Yokosuka. In July, she returned to the U.S. West Coast for overhaul; and, in November, resumed runs between Japan and the Persian Gulf. In May 1948, her schedule was altered; and, into September, she carried petroleum products from the Middle East to the east coast of the United States. She then returned to the Pacific; and, but for a run to Europe, she conducted Persian Gulf-Japan runs until ordered back to the United States for inactivation in January 1950.  Decommissioning  At the end of that month, she proceeded to the Puget Sound Navy Yard for tank cleaning and voyage repairs; then, in early April, moved south to San Diego, California, to complete inactivation. Despite the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, she was decommissioned as scheduled on 3 July but was soon reactivated again as that conflict drew available shipping into the Pacific and produced unfilled demands in other areas.  Recommissioned during Korean War  Severn was recommissioned on 29 December 1950 and, although assigned to Service Force, Atlantic, was initially employed in transpacific service. By April 1951, when she transited the Panama Canal to take up duties with the Atlantic Fleet, she had completed two runs to Japan.  East Coast operations  USS Intrepid and USS Belknap in 1968. Homeported at Newport, Rhode Island, Severn operated along the east coast and in the Puerto Rican area into the fall and, in November, was deployed, for the first time, to the Mediterranean for duty with the U.S. 6th Fleet. In March 1952, she returned to Newport. During the summer, she participated in midshipman cruise \\"Baker;\\" and, in the fall, after availability and independent ship exercises, resumed participation in scheduled operations in the western Atlantic and Caribbean. Severn returned to Newport, Rhode Island, from her next to last Mediterranean deployment on 10 June 1971. She spent the next 18 months engaged in operations and exercises out of Newport. Her final deployment to the Mediterranean was from January through August 1973.  Final decommissioning  During the first six months of 1974, Severn was at Newport preparing for decommissioning. On 1 July 1974, she was decommissioned and towed to the Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her name was struck from the Navy List, and her hulk was turned over to the Maritime Commission for disposal. Subsequently, she was sold, 22 January 1975, by MARAD. Her current fate is unknown.  Military awards and honors  Severn earned two battle stars during World War II.

The unit was formed by Finnish military intelligence with the assistance of German military intelligence for reconnaissance operations.Estonian Citizens in the German Armed Forces. Volunteers, Conscripts and Commandeered Troops Reconnaissance group Erna memorial plaque in Espoo, Finland Formation of the Erna platoon After the Soviet occupation of Estonia in 1940 hundreds of Estonian men fled to Finland rather than accept Soviet rule. The Estonian military attaché in Finland, Major Aksel Kristian, in the spring of 1941 had compiled a list of Estonians in Finland who wanted to liberate their homeland. Finnish intelligence subsequently recruited 15 volunteers and began training them on the island of Staffan in Soukka, Espoo. On 22 June 1941 Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Finland entered the war on the German side and Estonians, living in Finland were assembled in Helsinki to establish a voluntary unit to go to Estonia. The platoon commander was Colonel Henn Ants Kurg of the Estonian Army, who had been the last Estonian Military Attaché to France. The Germans gave the group the name \\"Erna\\", and two German liaison officers - Oberleutnant Reinhardt and Sonderführer Schwarze - had also joined the group. Erna was armed by and wearing the uniform of the Finnish army.C. Jurando, N Thomas PhD: Germany's Eastern Front Allies(2): Baltic Force, page 5. Osprey Publishing, 2002, The two Germans in charge wanted Erna to pledge allegiance to the Führer. However, Colonel Kurg strongly opposed this; he insisted that they were not Germans but Estonian volunteers, ready to co-operate, but without any commitments to Hitler. An agreement was reached that being in the service of the Finnish army, Erna should give the oath of loyalty to Finland. Accordingly, on 24 July 1941, the 15 specially trained men and 52 volunteers took an oath of allegiance to Finland. Action On the night of 10 July the platoon made a seaborne landing on the northern coast of Estonia with 42 men arriving onshore and hiding in the Kautla Marshes 60 km south east of Tallinn. Another 17 team members were parachuted in on 28 July. The group's task was to perform reconnaissance deep behind Red Army lines for the Finnish Army but it turned to saving around 2,000 civilians hiding in the Kautla woods by allowing them to escape while the outnumbered Erna force engaged Soviet NKVD Destruction Battalions in a fierce battle on 31 July to 1 August 1941.p16, Mart Laar: War in the Woods: Estonia's Struggle for Survival, 1944-1953.

The base was originally built by the Luftwaffe in 1935 and used as Fliegerhorst Klützow until early 1945 when it was overrun by the Red Army. Soviet air units were based there from 1948 to 1992. Over the years, the base was expanded, and a number of hardened aircraft shelters built. A small military town housing the airmen and their families was built nearby. The 239th Fighter Aviation Division was headquartered at the base from 1945 to 1992. The last flying unit stationed there was the 159th 'Novorossiysk' Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment flying Su-27 Flankers. After the Soviet forces left, the base was abandoned, and has fallen into ruin. In 1993 the airfield together with Kluczewo was included within the city limits of Stargard Szczeciński. In subsequent years the runway was used for auto shows from time to time. Recently Bridgestone announced plans to build a large tire factory near the site. Construction began in June 2007, but the runway will be preserved for possible use in the future.

The Sherdils are based at the Pakistan Air Force Academy, Risalpur, Pakistan and consist of nine Karakoram K-8P aircraft. Pilots of the Sherdils are not dedicated aerobatics pilots like other famous aerobatics teams. Sherdils draw their pilots from jet flying instructors at the PAF Academy's Advanced Jet Training Squadron. They have an additional role to prepare and conduct formation aerobatics at various national and international events apart from regularly training young pilots on advanced jet trainers. Currently, the Sherdils are being led by Group Captain Irfan Pattal.  History  A Sherdils K-8 Karakorum and a group of PAF personnel at the Zhuhai 2010 Air Show. An Airbus A380 flies past in the background. The team was officially formed on 17 August 1972 as a result of efforts by an Academy instructor, Sqn Ldr Bahar-ul-haq. The team was formed on the lines of Red Pelicans, the aerobatics team of RAF College, Cranwell where Bahar had been on an exchange tour. It was decided to put up a brief show on graduation parades as a demonstration of the professional skills of Academy instructors. After several trials of candidate instructors, a team was formed under the command of 1965 War hero, Wg Cdr Imtiaz Bhatti. He was the Officer Commanding of the BFT wing at that time. Other formation members included Flt Lt Aamer Ali Sharieff, Flt Lt A Rahim Yusufzai and Flt Lt Niaz Nabi, the latter becoming a most durable master of the ‘slot’ position. The initial performances of the team were highly successful. The \\"Tweety birds\\" performed at air shows for foreign dignitaries, including heads of state and military officers. Initially, the team had no name. The personal call sign of the leaders also denoted the team; it flew as ‘Sherdils’ for the first time on 19 September 1974. Sherdils Aerobatics team was enhanced to 6 ship T-37 aircraft team in March, 2004 under the leadership of Wg Cdr Tariq Chaudhary, OC BFT Wing. The team was further increased to 9 ship for the first time on 2 October 2004 under the pioneer leadership of Wg Cdr Vaqar Ali Qureshi, OC No 1 BFT Squadron. This was a historical milestone for PAF as it brought international fame and respect among the community of nations. Despite the limited power of T-37 aircraft engines to handle such a big formation especially the outer wings was a daunting task. The problem was catered by anticipation and flawless professionalism by the instructors of Basic Flying Training Wing flying in the team. The pioneer 9 Ship Sherdils team members were Wg Cdr Vaqar (Ldr), Flt Lt Armughan (No 2), Flt Lt Nusrat (No 3), Sqn Ldr Tariq Azeem (No 4 slot/deputy ldr), Sqn Ldr Nasir (No 5), Sqn Ldr Sohail (No 6), Sqn Ldr Zahid (No 7), Flt Lt Hammad (No 8) and Sqn Ldr Tanveer (No 9). The only unfortunate accident which T-37 Sherdils team ever met in their illustrious performance was in October 1978 and lost one aircraft and its leader Flt Lt Alamdar. Other formation members at the time were Flt Lt Shahid Nisar (No 2 & Deputy Lead), Flt Lt Irfan Masum (No 3) and Flt Lt Tasneem (No 4 slot). The Sherdils transitioned to the newer and more modern Karakoram K-8P aircraft, jointly developed by Pakistan and China. A four-ship K-8P aircraft performed for the first time in November 2009 at PAF Academy Risalpur under the leadership of Squadron Leader Amir Misbah. Other team members were Squadron Leader Khalid Matin (Slot member), Squadron Leader Wajahat Syed (Left Wing) and Squadron Leader Nasir Zia (Right Wing). By the Springs of 2010, Sherdils increased from 4-ship to 7-ship and perform at the closing ceremony of Exercise High-Mark 2010 under the leadership of Wing Commander Syed Ali Zaidi. Soon it transformed into 9-ship team and performed at the Graduation ceremony in May 2010. In October 2010, led by Squadron Leader Khalid Matin, 9-Ship Sherdils performed at Graduation ceremony Risalpur again before leaving for its first ever International Participation at Zhuhai Air-Show, China from 16 to 21 November that year. Since then, Sherdils have performed at every Graduation Ceremony of PAF Academy Risalpur and regularly participates in various National and International events.  Formation style  With 4xT-37s, the type of formation and sequence virtually remained the same since the team's inception – line astern to the diamond formation during a loop, then clover- leaf, steep turn, barrel roll and finally, the breath-taking bomb-burst. Attempts were made to increase the number of aircraft in the team, but engine thrust demands were excessive for the outer formation members to cope with. A four aircraft diamond has thus remained the basic formation of the ‘Sherdils’for almost three decades. In 2004, the number of aircraft in the main formation were increased to six initially, performing loops in delta formation, barrel roll and steep turn in double arrow-head formation. It was increased to Nine in October, 2004 with change in formation sequence and aerobatics. Most of the evasive manoeuvers for safety of formation members were developed during this time. The outclass skill, precision and smooth handling remained the hallmark of this formation throughout its history. In 2009, the team shifted onto the K-8P aircraft. At present, the team comprises nine aircraft, with six ship main-team. Rest three aircraft perform the initial run-in and break-off in a linear bomburst over the venue. Since early 2017, Sherdil team has enhanced its basic display sequence with addition of more thrilling maneuvers.  Paint scheme  T-37 era Color Schemes Appreciating the important quality affecting display aircraft i.e., appearance, the T-37s were painted all red. However, maintenance of the red- painted aircraft without the costly polyurethane coating became a problem. The team reverted to the all-metal finish, with only the nose, wing tips and tail painted day-glow orange. In 1980, with the induction of six ex-USAF T-37s, which were polyurethane-coated all white, ‘Sherdils’ became a logical choice for a new titillating appearance. The dramatic ‘sunburst’ paint scheme was adopted, red rays on an all-white background. Later, the aircraft were again painted red, but with the rays in white, a scheme that is in vogue today. Coloured smoke has been used to enhance the aesthetic qualities of the formation; smoke trails give the impression of multicoloured ribbons twirling in the sky. Up till 2017 Sherdils' K-8P aircraft were painted in the overall white color scheme with red and blue stripes. The team publicly revealed its current color scheme at an airshow held on the country's 70th Independence day celebrations held at Islamabad on 14 August; an all-white fuselage with green covering the entire vertical stabiliser and continuing along the upper fuselage all the way to the nose, a crescent and star on the tail and the team's name written in typeface underneath.

Forester that appeared in Cosmopolitan magazine in June 1942. Filmed in Canada, it starred Paul Muni, Anna Lee, Lillian Gish in her return to the screen, Cedric Hardwicke and Robert Coote. Plot Erik Toresen, a widower and peaceful man, is stirred to violence after the Nazis occupy his quiet Norwegian fishing village. German abuses lead Erik to form a Resistance group. He kills the head of the Nazis occupying his village, and then escapes to Britain, and guides some British Commandos to a raid on a secret airstrip the Germans are building on the Norwegian coast. CastProduction Inspired by 1941 commando raids in Norway, Columbia Pictures registered the name \\"Commandos Story\\" in 1941 feeling the title could spawn a film.p. 82 Dick, Bernard F. The Merchant Prince of Poverty Row: Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures University Press of Kentucky, 13 Jan. 2015 The film was shot in the Greater Victoria, Canada, area. Saanich Inlet stands in for Norwegian fjords. The airstrip is what would become the Victoria International Airport. Hall's Boat House (now Goldstream Marina) is where the wharf scenes are shot. The Canadian Army provided a large number of troops as well as military equipment while the RCAF provided aircraft shown include two Bristol Bolingbrokes and two Westland Lysanders.Commando Action Life 11 Jan 1943 The ship used in the film was HMCS Prince David (F89) a former CN Steamship which had been converted to an Armed Merchant Cruiser in 1940. During the 1930s, Oak Bay, British Columbia was the original \\"Hollywood North\\" when fourteen films were produced in Greater Victoria between 1933 and 1938. An off-season exhibition building on the Willows Fairgrounds was converted to a film soundstage and films were produced with stars such as Lillian Gish, Paul Muni, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Edith Fellows, Charles Starrett and Rin Tin Tin Jr. The Willows Park Studio films include: 1933 The Crimson Paradise, 1935 Secrets of Chinatown, 1936 Fury and the Woman (aka Lucky Corrigan), Lucky Fugitives, Secret Patrol, Stampede, Tugboat Princess, What Price Vengeance, Manhattan Shakedown, Murder is News, Woman Against the World, Death Goes North, Convicted, Special Inspector, Commandos Strike at Dawn. Soundtrack The film was nominated for an Academy Award for its score by the world-renowned opera composer, Louis Gruenberg and an uncredited John Leipold. This was Gruenberg's second Hollywood film score and second nomination for one; he'd moved to Beverly Hills in the late 1930s to supplement his income and hang out with fellow LA resident, Arnold Schoenberg, whose works Gruenberg had championed when these composers could still live in Europe and not Los Angeles County.

The project was developed as a means to assert Canada's sovereignty in the Arctic Ocean. It commenced in 1985 but was cancelled in 1990 while still in the final design stage. It was Canada's direct response to the unauthorized transit through the Northwest Passage in summer 1985 by , a United States Coast Guard icebreaker. Polar 8 refers the capability of the ship in ice of that thickness in feet, in this case .Maginley and Collin, p. 157Maginley, p. 63 Initiated in 1985, the vessel was never constructed and the project was cancelled in 1988. Background Canada's claims to their Arctic region and the Northwest Passage were challenged by the United States in the 1969 and 1985. In 1969, the American oil tanker traversed the entirety Northwest Passage with the help of Canadian and American icebreakers. The transit was difficult and in response, the Canadian government passed the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act. In 1972, Canada had \\"ice-covered areas\\" added to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea agreement, and in 1982, the agreement included exclusive economic zones, expanding Canada's control over their Arctic area. In 1985, controversy arose again after the United States Coast Guard icebreaker sailed around through the Northwest Passage without having asked permission from the Canadian government, which was required following the changes to the Law of the Sea agreement.Michaud and Nossal, p. 89 Studies into the construction of large icebreakers for Canada's north began in 1971. The Canadian Coast Guard initially tried to acquire two types of polar icebreaker, a Polar 7 and a Polar 10.Griffiths, p. 228 The Polar 7 was to be of conventionally-powered design and the project was approved in the mid-1970s and German and Milne Ltd of Montreal, the largest naval architect firm in the country, were employed to design the ship. In 1976, the Canadian government asked German and Milne to design a Polar 10, nuclear-powered icebreaker.Griffiths, pp. 228–29Michaud and Nossal, p. 90 However, by March 1978, the required design had changed to a hybrid nuclear-conventionally powered vessel and in July 1979, proposals for the propulsion were received from the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and France. Due to various reasons, the nations pulled out, save for France by the following year.Griffiths, p. 229 The lack of competition for the hybrid- powered Polar 10 icebreaker design led the Canadian government to consider its alternatives. This led to the Polar 8 Project, a conventionally-powered large icebreaker. A conventionally-powered Polar 10 icebreaker design was rejected as being too costly to operate. Design and project initiation Designed to be capable of year-round operations in the Arctic regions, the vessel was ordered based on the increased oil exploration activity in the Beaufort Sea and future Arctic oil and mineral exploration. The ship was also required to exert Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic area after Canada's claim to the area had been challenged by the United States. The ship was to have a planned displacement of and powered by either a diesel electric or diesel direct engine driving three shafts, creating . This would have given the vessel a maximum speed of at sea. The vessel was to be capable of uninterrupted progress in pack ice and the steel that the ship was to built from was to be tested down to .Maginley, p. 65 The ship's of aviation fuel would have carried in tanks separated from the outer hull to minimize the chances of pollution. The vessel itself would have carried of diesel fuel. The ship would have been equipped with laboratories, a moon pool and other deck equipment for scientific research. The ship would have been able to operate up to three helicopters. At the time, it would have been the world's largest icebreaker. In September 1985, the Conservative Mulroney government chose the Polar 8 design for construction. The Department of National Defence had reservations about the project, claiming that the ship had no way to respond to northern submarine threats and that the cost of the vessel would exceed its estimated cost of $300–500 million. The competition to build the vessel was messy and the Mulroney government created a committee to sift through the proposals to find the best three. Construction and cancellation The decision to award the construction contract was taken in 1987 when it was awarded to Versatile Pacific Shipyards Limited of North Vancouver, British Columbia. Soon after the project was awarded, Versatile Pacific Shipyards began having financing problems. The costs also began to rise, as Versatile claimed it had been too optimistic in its estimates. In May 1988, the design team asked for a further $70–80 million if the vessel was to keep its diesel-electric propulsion. The design was completed in 1988 and estimated costs had climbed over the budgeted amount.Michaud and Nossal, p. 91 This led the Canadian Coast Guard to ask the Versatile team to come up with a design based on a cheaper propulsion system. Before this could go any further, the Versatile Pacific Shipyards were put up for sale in December 1988. Funding for the project was reduced over the following years and on 19 February 1990, the program was officially cancelled, mainly due to rising costs, now pegged at $680 million. Following the Polar 8 Project cancellation, the Canadian Coast Guard funded the modernization overhaul and hull extension of the large icebreaker in order to maintain a strategic presence in the Arctic Ocean. The Canadian Coast Guard also loaned a former commercial icebreaker, , in 1992 as a stop-gap measure.

After his sudden and early death, Harvard University's Newell Boathouse was built in his memory. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1957. At Harvard Newell was the son of Samuel Newell, a prominent lawyer, and grew up on a farm near Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in the Berkshire Hills. He enrolled at Phillips Exeter Academy in 1887 and graduated in 1890. He attended Harvard University, where he became an All-American football player for the Harvard Crimson football team. Nicknamed \\"Ma\\" Newell, he played right tackle for the Harvard football team from 1890 to 1893. Newell stood 5 feet, 10 inches, weighed approximately 170 pounds, and played every minute of every game for Harvard from 1890 to 1893. During his four years on the team, Harvard had a record of 46–3 (including 38 shutouts) and outscored opponents 1,926 to 95. The New York World wrote the following about Newell in 1892: Newell was selected as an All-American in all four years at Harvard—one of only three players in the history of college football to be named as an All-American in all four years of collegiate play. Newell was known as \\"a deeply sensitive man, a compassionate fellow of heart and understanding in complete contrast to the ferocity with which he played the game of football.\\" On the field, Newell was known for \\"his tremendous leg-drive and steel-trap grip in tackling enemy runners.\\" Newell was also known for his love of the outdoors and became an amateur naturalist. He also competed on Harvard's varsity crew (rowing team) from 1891 to 1893. An 1893 newspaper article described Newell's contribution to the crew as follows: While at Harvard, Newell was also a member of the Institute of 1770, Dickey, Hasty Pudding Club and Signet. After Harvard After graduating from Harvard in the spring of 1894, Newell became the head football coach at Cornell University in 1894 and 1895. The captain of the 1894 team was Glenn Scobey \\"Pop\\" Warner. Newell's coaching record at Cornell was 9–8–2. When he left after a 22–0 victory over Michigan in his first year coaching at Cornell, The Syracuse Standard wrote: In December 1896, Newell became an assistant division superintendent of the Boston and Albany Railroad. He was killed on Christmas Eve 1897 when an engine backed over him at Springfield, Massachusetts. He was buried in the Newell family plot in Walnut Hill. Memorials and honors After Newell's death, Harvard alumni donated $2,000 to construct a new boathouse on the Charles River for use by the crew and named the Newell Boathouse. The tribute was completed in 1916.In addition, Gate No. 1 at Harvard's Soldiers Field was renamed the Newell Gate. In 1928, syndicated sports writer Peg Murray recalled Newell as a \\"Pillar of Strength\\" and perhaps the greatest tackle in the history of the game: John Heisman, the namesake of the Heisman Trophy, selected Newell as his pick for the greatest football player of all time.The Greatest Player Ever Newell was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1957. In 1967, he was one of the first group inducted into the Harvard Varsity Club Hall of Fame.

Dandridge is best known as being the older sister of actress and singer Dorothy Dandridge and the daughter of actress Ruby Dandridge. Dandridge was a member of the Dandridge Sisters musical group, along with Etta Jones and Dorothy Dandridge from 1934 until the group disbanded in 1940. Dandridge went on to appear in minor roles on films and television from 1940 through the early 1960s. Never really achieving notable success as her younger sister, Dandridge disappeared from the public eye by 1970. Dandridge died after suffering a stroke on October 26, 1991 at age 70. Early life and career Dandridge was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to Cyril Dandridge (October 25, 1895 – July 9, 1989), and the former Ruby Jean Butler (March 3, 1900 – October 17, 1987), an aspiring entertainer. Dandridge's parents separated shortly before the birth of her sister Dorothy. Initially, Ruby Dandridge put her two girls to work performing acrobatics, songs, and skits. She billed them as the \\"Wonder Children\\". Realizing the potential success of her girls (and acknowledging her chance of stardom in the entertainment industry was at best, limited), Ruby and her girlfriend Geneva Williams decided to have her daughters embark on a tour of the United States. Under Neva's tutelage, the Wonder Children earned $400–$500 per appearance during the late 1920s, touring through Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia and many other states. Neva accompanied the girls on piano as well as acted as their manager and was a particularly aggressive disciplinarian. Both Dorothy and Vivian suffered from her angry outbursts, which were frequent and severe. Because their income was more important to the family than their education, Dorothy and Vivian did not attend regular classes at school until the 8th grade, instead relying on tutors (since they were the primary breadwinners of the family). After the stock market crash in 1929, the Wonder Children were added to the long list of the unemployed. Ruby Dandridge, still clinging to the hopes of a film career for herself and her daughters, bought four bus tickets and moved the family to Los Angeles. After immersing herself into the professional community of black Hollywood, Ruby found limited opportunities for herself or her girls. After Clarence Muse, a working black actor in Hollywood (who befriended the family) told Ruby that her daughters were unlikely to meet with success in California, she enrolled them in a dancing school run by Laurette Butler. The Dandridge Sisters In California, the Dandridge daughters befriended another girl, Etta Jones, and began to sing together. After Jones' father heard them sing, Ruby Dandridge decided that the three should form a singing group. Thus, the Dandridge Sisters were born. While Neva and Ruby gained bit parts in films (Neva appeared as a maid in the Shirley Temple vehicle The Little Colonel), the Dandridge Sisters began appearing in musical sequences of films and toured over the United States, sharing bills with the likes of Nat King Cole, Mantan Moreland, and dancer Marie Bryant. The female trio was a sort of black Andrews Sisters, singing songs in three part harmony. They eventually became headliners at the Cotton Club in Harlem, New York. They even appeared in a short-run Broadway musical revue, Swingin' The Dream, in 1939, at the Center Theater. The Dandridge Sisters also toured in London and Hawaii, and recorded four tracks with well- known big band leader Jimmie Lunceford and his orchestra: \\"You Ain't Nowhere\\", \\"Minnie the Moocher Is Dead\\", \\"I Ain't Gonna Study War No More,\\" and a minor hit, \\"That's Your Red Wagon\\". After touring for a year and a half, however, the Dandridge Sisters group abruptly disbanded, after Dorothy was determined to become an actress, unsatisfied with just appearances in occasional soundies or bit parts in Hollywood films. Dandridge detested life on the road and was certain she could find bigger success as a dramatic actress. This left Dandridge in a desperate financial situation. She attempted to find work in clubs, but many were not interested. She did, however, find employment as an occasional actress in films but did not achieve the same level of success as her sister Dorothy. Solo career, Film and television Dandridge appeared in some minor film roles: she co-starred with Frances Dee as native girl Melisse in the 1943 classic I Walked with a Zombie and appeared alongside her sister in 1953's Bright Road, where she played a small role of schoolteacher Ms. Nelson (she was uncredited in both films) and acted as Dorothy's hairdresser on the film. She appeared with the Dandridge Sisters in musical sequences of the films The Big Broadcast of 1936 (with George Burns and Gracie Allen), A Day at the Races (with the Marx Brothers), It Can't Last Forever (with Ralph Bellamy and Betty Furness), Irene (with Ray Milland, Anna Neagle, and Billie Burke) and Going Places (with Louis Armstrong and Maxine Sullivan). She also appeared in the soundie Snow Gets in Your Eyes as a member of the Dandridge Sisters and as the voice of \\"So White\\" in the controversial cartoon Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs opposite her mother Ruby Dandridge. Dandridge appeared as an uncredited extra in 1943's Stormy Weather. In the summer of 1955, Dandridge replaced Thelma Carpenter in the Broadway play Ankles Aweigh. She moved to the Alvin Hotel in New York City, but after this engagement she largely disappeared from show business. Dandridge attended the Academy Awards in 1955 with Dorothy Dandridge when Dorothy was nominated for Best Actress for her role in Carmen Jones.  Disappearance  By 1956, friends and family members were concerned for the welfare of Dandridge, as she moved away and went into seclusion. Her sister Dorothy hired a private detective to find her missing sister, but to no avail; Dorothy later found out that her sister was in the south of France trying to find work. Later, she found out that her sister was residing in New York City. At this point, Dorothy and Vivian did not remain in contact, though Dorothy sometimes provided financial assistance to Vivian and her son Michael Wallace. Other than the occasional telegram, Dorothy and Vivian remained estranged. Upon Dorothy's death in 1965, Dandridge could not bear to attend the funeral. Instead, she disappeared from the public eye. Solo recording In 1968, Vivian signed a recording contract with Jubilee Records and released a jazz LP, The Look of Love, that same year. The album was produced by Bob Stephens and conducted by Charles Coleman, and included such tracks as \\"Love is Blue\\", \\"Try to Remember\\", \\"Sunny\\", \\"Strange Fruit\\", and \\"Lover Man\\". On the cover, Vivian is lying on a sofa, looking pensive while holding a snifter of brandy. The album was not successful. The Look of LovePersonal life, death and legacy Dandridge, under the alias \\"Marina Rozell,\\" later settled in Seattle, Washington, where she lived for the rest of her life. Author Donald Bogle did an interview with Dandridge discussing her sister and mother in 1991; later that year when Bogle returned, he found that Dandridge had died of a massive stroke. Dandridge was married at least five times: Jack Montgomery (1942–1943), Warren Bracken (1945–1945), Ralph Bledsoe (1946–48), Forace Stead (1951–1953) and Gustav Friedrich (1958–1968). Dandridge was also romantically linked to actor Emmett Wallace (known as \\"Babe Wallace\\") with whom she had a son, Michael Emmett Wallace (born November 7, 1943). Dandridge did not attend the funeral of her sister, admitting that it was just too painful to return. She said, \\"I grieved in my own way, in my privacy. Dottie knew that I loved her.\\" Vivian later rekindled a relationship with her mother (albeit an adversarial one) until her mother died penniless in a Los Angeles nursing home of a massive heart attack in 1987. Dandridge's granddaughter, Nayo Wallace, is also an actress, appearing on television series, film and on Broadway.

He played college football at Colgate University and an end. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1982. Early years Orsi was born on November 11, 1908, in Newark, New Jersey to Italian immigrant parents. The youngest of seven children, he grew up in Newark and attended Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey. In 1926, the Columbia High football team, with Orsi, made it to the state finals but lost 7–0. Orsi moved on to The Perkiomen School from 1927 to 1928. On his birthday in 1967, he was honored at Perkiomen with 'John Orsi Day' to mark his athletic exploits. He also served as the chairman of the Annual Gift Fund at Perkiomen for that school year. Colgate Orsi moved on to Colgate University, where he was a three-sport star. He played basketball and ran track, but starred in football for the head coach Andrew Kerr. With Orsi at end, Colgate went 25–3 from 1929 to 1931. He made headlines in 1930 in a postseason charity game against NYU at Yankee Stadium. With Colgate leading 7–0, NYU scored a late touchdown to bring the score to 7–6, but Orsi blocked the ensuing extra point attempt to seal the victory. Lloyd Jordan, an assistant coach with Colgate at the time, later recalled that block as one of the best memories of his coaching career. The block in 1930 set the stage for Orsi's All-American year in 1931. Colgate had a great year with Orsi as a senior captain, only losing to NYU in Yankee Stadium. Orsi had perhaps his best game against rival Syracuse at Archbold Stadium. Colgate won the game 21–7 with Orsi scoring one touchdown and paving the way with blocks on the other two. After the season, Orsi was selected to the All-America team and was invited to Hollywood for the filming of 'The All-American' (1932). Coaching Orsi did not go far after graduating as he joined Kerr's coaching staff at Colgate. He was the end coach beginning in 1932 with the famous undefeated, untied, unscored upon, and uninvited team. He held the position as end coach until resigning in 1941. He moved on to the William Penn Charter School as an assistant coach in 1942 and assumed the head coaching position for the 1943 season. From 1944 to 1945, he was an assistant coach at Germantown Academy and from 1946 to 1956 he was the head coach at Episcopal Academy. He later became vice president of the Maxwell Football Club and was on hand at their award ceremonies, including 1968 when O. J. Simpson won the Maxwell Award. Personal life Orsi married Elizabeth Claire Shea in 1936 and they had three children. Elizabeth died from leukemia, and Orsi remarried to Katherine White in 1953. Orsi lived in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania for much of his later life and died in 1978, in Naples, Florida.

Nicotine dependence is a chronic, relapsing disease defined as a compulsive craving to use the drug, despite harmful social consequences. Tolerance is another component of drug dependence. Nicotine dependence develops over time as a person continues to use nicotine. Nicotine dependence is a serious public health concern due to it being one of the leading causes of avoidable deaths worldwide. There are different ways of measuring nicotine dependence. The five common dependence assessment scales are the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the Cigarette Dependence Scale, the Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale, and the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives. The long use of Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence is supported by the existence of significant preexisting research, and its conciseness. First-time nicotine users develop a dependence about 32% of the time. There are approximately 976 million smokers in the world. There is an increased frequency of nicotine dependence in people with anxiety disorders. Nicotine is a parasympathomimetic stimulant that attaches to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain. Neuroplasticity within the brain's reward system occurs as a result of long-term nicotine use, leading to nicotine dependence. There are genetic risk factors for developing dependence. For instance, genetic markers for a specific type of nicotinic receptor (the α5-α3-β4 nicotine receptors) have been linked to increased risk for dependence. Evidence-based medicine can double or triple a smoker's chances of quitting successfully.  Definition  A alt=A National Institute on Drug Abuse video explaining that anyone can become addicted to drugs. Nicotine dependence is defined as a neurobiological adaptation to repeated drug exposure that is manifested behaviorally by highly controlled or compulsive use; psychoactive effects such as tolerance, physical dependence, and pleasant effect; and nicotine-reinforced behavior, including an inability to quit despite harmful effects, a desire to quit, and repeated cessation attempts. Nicotine dependence is a chronic, relapsing disease defined as a compulsive craving to use the drug, despite harmful social consequences; inability to control drug use; and onset of withdrawal-like symptoms when the drug is discontinued. A 1988 Surgeon General report states, \\"Tolerance\\" is another aspect of drug addiction [dependence] whereby a given dose of a drug produces less effect or increasing doses are required to achieve a specified intensity of response. Physical dependence on the drug can also occur, and is characterized by a withdrawal syndrome that usually accompanies drug abstinence. After cessation of drug use, there is a strong tendency to relapse.\\" Nicotine dependence leads to heavy smoking and causes severe withdrawal symptoms and relapse back to smoking. Nicotine dependence develops over time as a person continues to use nicotine. Teenagers do not have to be daily or long-term smokers to show withdrawal symptoms. Relapse should not frustrate the nicotine user from trying to quit again. A 2015 review found \\"Avoiding withdrawal symptoms is one of the causes of continued smoking or relapses during attempts at cessation, and the severity and duration of nicotine withdrawal symptoms predict relapse.\\" Symptoms of nicotine dependence include irritability, anger, impatience, and problems in concentrating.  Diagnosis  There are different ways of measuring nicotine dependence. The five common dependence assessment scales are the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the Cigarette Dependence Scale, the Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale, and the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives. The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence focuses on measuring physical dependence which is defined \\"as a state produced by chronic drug administration, which is revealed by the occurrence of signs of physiological dysfunction when the drug is withdrawn; further, this dysfunction can be reversed by the administration of drug\\". The long use of Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence is supported by the existence of significant preexisting research, and its conciseness. The 4th edition of the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-IV) had a nicotine dependence diagnosis which was defines as \\"...a cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms...\\" In the updated DSM-5 there is no nicotine dependence diagnosis, but rather Tobacco Use Disorder, which is defined as, \\"A problematic pattern of tobacco use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least 2 of the following [11 symptoms], occurring within a 12-month period.\\" The Cigarette Dependence Scale was developed \\"to index dependence outcomes and not dependence mechanisms\\". The Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale, \\"a 19-item self-report measure, was developed as a multidimensional scale to assess nicotine dependence\\". The Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives \\"is a 68-item measure developed to assess dependence as a motivational state\\".  Mechanisms  Traditional cigarettes are the most common delivery device for nicotine. However, electronic cigarettes are becoming more popular. Nicotine can also be delivered via other tobacco products such as chewing tobacco, snus, pipe tobacco, hookah, all of which can produce nicotine dependence.  Biomolecular  Dopamine Pre- existing cognitive and mood disorders may influence the development and maintenance of nicotine dependence. Nicotine is a parasympathomimetic stimulant that binds to and activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain, which subsequently causes the release of dopamine and other neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, gamma- aminobutyric acid, glutamate, endorphins, and several neuropeptides. Repeated exposure to nicotine can cause an increase in the number of nicotinic receptors, which is believed to be a result of receptor desensitization and subsequent receptor upregulation. This upregulation or increase in the number of nicotinic receptors significantly alters the functioning of the brain reward system. With constant use of nicotine, tolerance occurs at least partially as a result of the development of new nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain. After several months of nicotine abstinence, the number of receptors go back to normal. Nicotine also stimulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the adrenal medulla, resulting in increased levels of adrenaline and beta-endorphin. Its physiological effects stem from the stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are located throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. Chronic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activation from repeated nicotine exposure can induce strong effects on the brain, including changes in the brain's physiology, that result from the stimulation of regions of the brain associated with reward, pleasure, and anxiety. These complex effects of nicotine on the brain are still not well understood. When these receptors are not occupied by nicotine, they are believed to produce withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms can include cravings for nicotine, anger, irritability, anxiety, depression, impatience, trouble sleeping, restlessness, hunger, weight gain, and difficulty concentrating. Neuroplasticity within the brain's reward system occurs as a result of long- term nicotine use, leading to nicotine dependence. There are genetic risk factors for developing dependence. For instance, genetic markers for a specific type of nicotinic receptor (the α5-α3-β4 nicotine receptors) have been linked to increased risk for dependence. The most well-known hereditary influence related to nicotine dependence is a mutation at rs16969968 in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor CHRNA5, resulting in an amino acid alteration from aspartic acid to asparagine. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs6474413 and rs10958726 in CHRNB3 are highly correlated with nicotine dependence. Many other known variants within the CHRNB3–CHRNA6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are also correlated with nicotine dependence in certain ethnic groups. There is a relationship between CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and complete smoking cessation. Increasing evidence indicates that the genetic variant CHRNA5 predicts the response to smoking cessation medicine.  Psychosocial  In addition to the specific neurological changes in nicotinic receptors, there are other changes that occur as dependence develops. Through various conditioning mechanisms (operant and cue/classical), smoking comes to be associated with different mood and cognitive states as well as external contexts and cues.  Treatment  There are treatments for nicotine dependence, although the majority of the evidence focuses on treatments for cigarette smokers rather than people who use other forms of tobacco (e.g., chew, snus, pipes, hookah, e-cigarettes). Evidence- based medicine can double or triple a smoker's chances of quitting successfully.  Medication  There are eight major evidence-based medications for treating nicotine dependence: bupropion, cytisine (not approved for use in some countries, including the US), nicotine gum, nicotine inhaler, nicotine lozenge/mini-lozenge, nicotine nasal spray, nicotine patch, and varenicline. These medications have been shown to significantly improve long-term (i.e., 6-months post-quit day) abstinence rates, especially when used in combination with psychosocial treatment. The nicotine replacement treatments (i.e., patch, lozenge, gum) are dosed based on how dependent a smoker is—people who smoke more cigarettes or who smoke earlier in the morning use higher doses of nicotine replacement treatments. There is no consensus for remedies for tobacco use disorder among pregnant smokers who also use alcohol and stimulants.  Psychosocial  Psychosocial interventions delivered in- person (individually or in a group) or over the phone (including mobile phone interventions) have been shown to effectively treat nicotine dependence. These interventions focus on providing support for quitting and helping with smokers with problem-solving and developing healthy responses for coping with cravings, negative moods, and other situations that typically lead to relapse. The combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions has been shown to be especially effective.  Epidemiology  First-time nicotine users develop a dependence about 32% of the time. There are approximately 976 million smokers in the world. Estimates are that half of smokers (and one- third of former smokers) are dependent based on DSM criteria, regardless of age, gender or country of origin, but this could be higher if different definitions of dependence were used. Recent data suggest that, in the United States, the rates of daily smoking and the number of cigarettes smoked per day are declining, suggesting a reduction in population-wide dependence among current smokers. However, there are different groups of people who are more likely to smoke than the average population, such as those with low education or low socio-economic status and those with mental illness. There is also evidence that among smokers, some subgroups may be more dependent than other groups. Men smoke at higher rates than do women and score higher on dependence indices; however, women may be less likely to be successful in quitting, suggesting that women may be more dependent by that criterion. There is an increased frequency of nicotine dependence in people with anxiety disorders. 6% of smokers who want to quit smoking each year are successful at quitting. Nicotine withdrawal is the main factor hindering smoking cessation. A 2010 World Health Organization report states, \\"Greater nicotine dependence has been shown to be associated with lower motivation to quit, difficulty in trying to quit, and failure to quit, as well as with smoking the first cigarette earlier in the day and smoking more cigarettes per day.\\" E-cigarettes may result in starting nicotine dependence again. Greater nicotine dependence may result from dual use of traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes. Like tobacco companies did in the last century, there is a possibility that e-cigarettes could result in a new form of dependency on nicotine across the world.  Concerns  alt=Nicotine use and addiction. Nicotine dependence results in substantial mortality, morbidity, and socio-economic impacts. Nicotine dependence is a serious public health concern due to it being one of the leading causes of avoidable deaths worldwide. The medical community is concerned that e-cigarettes may escalate global nicotine dependence, particularly among adolescents who are attracted to many of the flavored e-cigarettes. There is strong evidence that vaping induces symptoms of dependence in users. Many organizations such the World Health Organization, American Lung Association, and Australian Medical Association do not approve of vaping for quitting smoking in youth, making reference to concerns about their safety and the potential that experimenting with vaping may result in nicotine dependence and later tobacco use.

The use of terms and images referring to Native Americans and First Nations as the name or mascot for a sports team is a topic of public controversy in the United States and Canada. Since the 1960s, as part of the indigenous civil rights movements, there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters. The protests target the prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the Cleveland Indians (in particular their \\"Chief Wahoo\\" logo, which is now officially retired); and the Washington Football Team (Redskins until 2020). Changes, such as the retirement of Native American names and mascots in a wide array of schools, has been a steady trend since the 1970s. The issue is often discussed in the media only in terms of the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a more comprehensive understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why sports teams should eliminate such practices. Social science research says that sports mascots and images, rather than being mere entertainment, are important symbols with deeper psychological and social effects. The accumulation of research on the harm done has led to over 115 professional organizations representing civil rights, educational, athletic, and scientific experts adopting resolutions or policies that state that the use of Native American names and/or symbols by non-native sports teams is a form of ethnic stereotyping that promotes misunderstanding and prejudice which contributes to other problems faced by Native Americans. Defenders of the current usage often state their intention to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits, such as fighting spirit and being strong, brave, stoic, dedicated, and proud; while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native Americans as savages. In general, the social sciences recognize that all stereotypes, whether positive or negative, are harmful because they promote false or misleading associations between a group and an attribute, fostering a disrespectful relationship. The injustice of such stereotypes is recognized with regard to other racial or ethnic groups, thus mascots are morally questionable regardless of offense being taken by individuals. Defenders of the status quo also state that the issue is not important, being only about sports, and that the opposition is nothing more than \\"political correctness\\", which change advocates argue ignores the extensive evidence of harmful effects of stereotypes and bias. The National Congress of American Indians and over 1,500 national Native organizations and advocates have called for a ban on all Native imagery, names, mascots, terms, redface, arrows, feathers, and appropriation of Native culture in sports. The joint letter included over 100 Native-led organizations, as well as tribal leaders and members of over 150 federally recognized tribes, reflecting a consensus among Native Americans that Native mascots are harmful. Although there has been a steady decline in the number of teams doing so, Native American images and nicknames nevertheless remain fairly common in American and Canadian sports, and may be found in use at all levels, ranging from youth teams to professional sports franchises. History European Americans have had a history of \\"playing Indian\\" that dates back to the colonial period. In the 19th century, fraternal organizations such as the Tammany Societies and the Improved Order of Red Men adopted the words and material culture of Native Americans in part to establish an aboriginal identity, while ignoring the dispossession and conquest of indigenous peoples. This practice spread to youth groups, such as the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) (in particular, the Order of the Arrow) and many summer camps. University students in the late 19th and early 20th centuries adopted Indian names and symbols for their sports teams, not from authentic sources but rather as Native American life was imagined by European Americans. Professional team nicknames had similar origins. In professional baseball the team that is now the Atlanta Braves was founded as the Boston Red Stockings in 1871; becoming the Boston Braves in 1912. Their owner at that time, James Gaffney, was a member of New York City's political machine, Tammany Hall, one of the societies formed to honor Tamanend, a chief of the Delaware. The team that moved to become the Washington Redskins in 1937 was originally also known as the Boston Braves since the football and baseball teams played at Braves Field. After moving to Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox, the team name was changed to the Boston Redskins in 1933, using a \\"red\\" identifier while retaining the Braves \\"Indian Head\\" logo. While defenders of the Redskins often cite coach William Henry Dietz, who claimed Native American heritage, to justify the name; the use of Native American names and imagery by this NFL team began in 1932 before hiring Dietz in 1933. The Cleveland Indians' name originated from a request by club owner Charles Somers to baseball writers to choose a new name to replace the \\"Naps\\" following the departure of their star player Nap Lajoie after the 1914 season. The name \\"Indians\\" was chosen as it was one of the nicknames previously applied to the old Cleveland Spiders baseball club during the time when Louis Sockalexis, a member of the Penobscot tribe of Maine, played for Cleveland. The success of the Boston Braves in the 1914 World Series may have been another reason for adopting an Indian mascot. The story that the team is named to honor Sockalexis, as the first Native American to play Major League Baseball, cannot be verified from historical documents. The news stories published to announce the selection in 1915 make no mention of Sockalexis, but do make many racist and insulting references to Native Americans. The stereotyping of Native Americans must be understood in the context of history which includes conquest, forced relocation, and organized efforts to eradicate native cultures, such as the boarding schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which separated young Native Americans from their families in order to educate them as European Americans. As stated in an editorial by Carter Meland (Anishinaabe heritage) and David E. Wilkins (Lumbee) both professors of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota: \\"Since the first Europeans made landfall in North America, native peoples have suffered under a weltering array of stereotypes, misconceptions and caricatures. Whether portrayed as noble savages, ignoble savages, teary-eyed environmentalists or, most recently, simply as casino-rich, native peoples find their efforts to be treated with a measure of respect and integrity undermined by images that flatten complex tribal, historical and personal experience into one- dimensional representations that tells us more about the depicters than about the depicted.\\" Viewpoints=Native Americans In the 1940s, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) created a campaign to eliminate negative stereotyping of Native American people in the media. Over time, the campaign began to focus on Indian names and mascots in sports. The NCAI maintains that teams with mascots such as the Braves and the Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native American people and demean their native traditions and rituals. \\"Often citing a long-held myth by non-Native people that \\"Indian\\" mascots \\"honor Native people,\\" American sports businesses such as the NFL's Washington 'Redskins' and Kansas City 'Chiefs', MLB's Cleveland 'Indians' and Atlanta 'Braves', and the NHL's Chicago Black Hawks, continue to profit from harmful stereotypes originated during a time when white superiority and segregation were commonplace.\\" Several of the founders of the American Indian Movement, including Clyde Bellecourt, Vernon Bellecourt, Dennis Banks and Russel Means, were among the first to protest names and mascots such as the Washington Redskins and Chief Wahoo. Vernon Bellecourt also founded the National Coalition Against Racism in Sports and Media (NCARSM) in 1989. Cornel Pewewardy (Comanche-Kiowa), Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University, cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture. Such practices can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism or neocolonialism. Native mascots are also part of the larger issues of cultural appropriation and the violation of indigenous intellectual property rights, which includes all instances where non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment and commerce. It has been argued that harm to Native Americans occurs because the appropriation of Native culture by the majority society continues the systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress indigenous groups. Some see the use of caricatures of Native Americans as sports mascots as contributing to their political and economic marginalization. Where other minorities would be consulted, decisions impacting Native Americans, such as building the Dakota Access Pipeline, are made while excluding Native concerns. Another incident cited as indicative of the misunderstanding of Native American legal status because of stereotyping is the Baby Veronica case, in which a child was adopted by a white family without the consent of her father, an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation. Not all Native Americans are united in total opposition to mascots. Steven Denson, a professor at Southern Methodist University and member of the Chickasaw nation, while not issuing a blanket endorsement, has nevertheless stated that there are acceptable ways to use Native American mascots if it is done in a respectful and tasteful manner. He states: \\"I believe it is acceptable if used in a way that fosters understanding and increased positive awareness of the Native-American culture. And it must also be done with the support of the Native-American community. There is a way to achieve a partnership that works together to achieve mutually beneficial goals.\\" The NCAI recognized the right of individual tribes to established relationships with teams which allowed them to retain their names. The Spokane Indians, a minor league baseball team, has established a relationship with the Spokane tribe and moved away from the Native American imagery that was used by the team when it was founded in 1903. The logo is an \\"S\\" and includes a feather; \\"Spokane\\" is written on the team jerseys in Salish, the Spokane language which also is used in signs in the ballpark. The mascot is a person dressed as a trout, in reference to the tribe's tradition of fishing. Opponents of Native mascots are divide, with Suzan Shown Harjo stating that there is no such thing as a positive stereotype; while Stephanie Fryberg responds that while the team's use of the name may be respectful, the opposing fans may continue to use racist gestures and references. Social sciences and education The damage caused by the use of Native American mascots, particularly in an academic context, was stated by the Society of Indian Psychologists in 1999: > Stereotypical and historically inaccurate images of Indians, in general, > interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining > oversimplified and inaccurate views of indigenous peoples and their > cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual > information, they contribute to the development of cultural biases and > prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the > University.) In the same vein, we believe that continuation of the use of > Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused > by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity. Sports mascots have been cited as an example of microaggressions, the everyday insults that members of marginalized minority groups are subject to in the comments and actions of other groups in society. In 2005, the American Psychological Association (APA) issued a resolution \\"Recommending the Immediate Retirement of American Indian Mascots, Symbols, Images, and Personalities by Schools, Colleges, Universities, Athletic Teams, and Organizations\\" due to the harm done by creating a hostile environment, the negative impact on the self-esteem of American Indian children, and discrimination that may violate civil rights. It also impacts non-natives by reinforcing mainstream stereotypes, preventing learning about Native American culture. The APA states that stereotyping is disrespectful of the beliefs, traditions and values of Native Americans. Similar resolutions have been adopted by the North American Society for the Sociology of Sport, the American Sociological Association, the American Counseling Association, and the American Anthropological Association. In a 2005 report on the status of Native American students, the National Education Association included the elimination of Indian mascots and sports team names as one of its recommendations. In 2018, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation announced it would no longer consider teams with racist mascots, such as the Kansas City and Washington football teams, for its annual RWJF Sports Award, which recognizes organizations that contribute to public health through sports. Social science research gives weight to the perceptions of those directly affected. In particular, studies support the view that sports mascots and images are not trivial. Stereotyping directly affects academic performance and self-esteem, which contribute to all of the other issues faced by Native Americans, including suicide, unemployment, and poverty. European Americans exposed to mascots are more likely to believe not only that stereotypes are true, but that Native Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes. Two studies examining the effect of exposure to an American Indian sports mascot found a tendency to endorse stereotypes of a different minority group (Asian Americans), which is indicative of a \\"spreading effect\\". Exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking; demonstrating the harm done to society by stereotyping of any kind. A connection between stereotyping and racism of any group increasing the likelihood of stereotyping others was made by Native Americans opposing the \\"Indians\\" mascot in Skowhegan, Maine when fliers promoting the KKK were distributed in that town. Civil rights The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) passed a resolution calling for the end of the use of Native American names, images, and mascots in 1999. In 2001, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights released an advisory opinion calling for an end to the use of Native American images and team names by non-Native schools. While recognizing the right to freedom of expression, the commission also recognizes those Native Americans and civil rights advocates that maintain these mascots, by promoting stereotypes, may violate anti-discrimination laws. When found in educational institutions, mascots may also create a hostile environment inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures, but instead teach that stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible. Those schools that claim that their sports imagery stimulate interest in Native American culture have not listened to Native groups and civil rights leaders who point out that even purportedly positive stereotypes both present a false portrayal of the past and prevent understanding of contemporary Native people as fellow Americans. In a report issued in 2012, a United Nations expert on Human Rights of Indigenous Peoples cited the continued use of Native American references by sports team as a part of the stereotyping that \\"obscures understanding of the reality of Native Americans today and instead help to keep alive racially discriminatory attitudes.\\" Justice Murray Sinclair, the head of Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission said in 2015 \\"sports teams with offensive names, such as Redskins and cartoonish aboriginal-looking mascots have no place in a country trying to come to grips with racism in its past\\". =Legal remedies= While all advocates for elimination of Native mascots agree that the practice is morally wrong, many do not find a basis for legal remedy. Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by African Americans and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The appropriation of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process. The difference is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group, in particular African Americans, would be unthinkable, and the continued claim that the stereotype of the \\"noble savage\\" honors Native Americans. In February 2013, the Michigan Department of Civil Rights (MDCR) filed a complaint with the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). MDCR's complaint asserted that new research clearly establishes that use of American Indian imagery negatively impacts student learning, creating an unequal learning environment in violation of Article VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In June 2013, the OCR dismissed the case on the basis that the legal standard required not only harm, but the intent to do harm, which was not established. A legal claim of discrimination rests upon a group agreeing that a particular term or practice is offensive, thus opponents of mascot change often point to individuals claiming Native American heritage who say they are not offended. This raised the difficulty of Native American identity in the United States, also an evolving controversy. Religious organizations In 1992, the Central Conference of American Rabbis issued a resolution calling for the end of sports teams names that promote racism, in particular the Atlanta Braves and the Washington Redskins. In 2001, the Unitarian Universalist Association passed a resolution to establish relationships with groups working to end the use of Indian images and symbols for sports and media mascots. In 2004, the United Methodist Church also passed a resolution condemning the use of Native American team names and sports mascots, which was highlighted in a meeting of the Black caucus of that organization in 2007. A group of sixty-one religious leaders in Washington, D.C. sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Redskins owner Daniel Snyder stating their moral obligation to join the \\"Change the Mascot\\" movement due to the offensive and inappropriate nature of the name which causes pain whether or not that is intended. Members of the Indian Affairs Committee of the Baltimore Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends approved a formal statement condemning the name of the Washington football team, stating that \\"the NFL has violated its core principles for decades by allowing the team playing in Washington, D.C., to carry the name 'redskins,' a racist epithet that insults millions of Native Americans. Continued use of the term encourages and perpetuates persecution, disrespect, and bigotry against Native men, women, and children\\". The Torch Committee, the student government organization of the Sandy Spring Friends School in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, voted to ban any apparel on the campus which includes the Redskins name, although the logo would continue to be allowed. In a meeting March 1, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Central Atlantic Conference of the United Church of Christ (UCC) unanimously passed a resolution proposing that its members boycott Washington Redskins games and shun products bearing the team's logo until the team changes its name and mascot. Redskin's spokesman Tony Wyllie offered a response, saying, \\"We respect those who disagree with our team's name, but we wish the United Church of Christ would listen to the voice of the overwhelming majority of Americans, including Native Americans, who support our name and understand it honors the heritage and tradition of the Native American community.\\" At its annual meeting in June 2014, the membership of the UCC also passed a resolution supporting the boycott. The resolution and boycott was passed by the National Synod of the UCC in June, 2015. Popular opinion The Washington Redskins logo at FedEx Field, in Maryland The topic became an issue on a national level in the twenty-first century, with a hearing before the US Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in 2011, and a symposium at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian in 2013. In November, 2015 President Obama, speaking at the White House Tribal Nations Conference, stated \\"Names and mascots of sports teams like the Washington Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native Americans\\" and praised Adidas for a new initiative to help schools change names and mascots by designing new logos and paying for part of the cost of new uniforms. Mainstream opinion reflects the function of identification with a sports team in both individual and group psychology. There are many benefits associated with sports fandom, both private (increased self-esteem) and public (community solidarity). The activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and group identification with a team. The name, mascot, cheerleaders, and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences. In an open letter published in 2013, Daniel Snyder explicitly invokes these associations with family, friends, and an 81-year tradition as being the most important reasons for keeping the Redskins name. When self-esteem becomes bound to the players and the team, there are many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences, including denial or rationalization of misbehavior. However, for some, the identity being expressed is one of supremacy, with the defense of native mascots being clearly racist. Some individuals who support the use of Native American mascots state that they are meant to be respectful, and to pay homage to Native American people. Many have made the argument that Native American mascots focus on bravery, courage and fighting skills rather than anything derogatory. Karl Swanson, vice-president of the Washington Redskins professional football team in 2003, declared in the magazine Sports Illustrated that his team's name \\"symbolizes courage, dignity, and leadership\\", and that the \\"Redskins symbolize the greatness and strength of a grand people\\". However, many note that the behavior of fans at games is not respectful. Richard Lapchick, director emeritus of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society, in an article: \\"Could you imagine people mocking African Americans in black face at a game? Yet go to a game where there is a team with an Indian name and you will see fans with war paint on their faces. Is this not the equivalent to black face?\\" Others claim Native American mascots help promote the culture to those who might be unaware of its significance. Chief Illiniwek, the former athletic symbol for the University of Illinois, became the subject of protest in 1988. In 1990 the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois called the mascot a dignified symbol: \\"His ceremonial dance is done with grace and beauty. The Chief keeps the memory of the people of a great Native American tribe alive for thousands of Illinoisans who otherwise would know little or nothing of them.\\" However, the mascot costume was not based on the clothing of the people of the Illinois Confederation, but of the Lakota people, and the first three men to portray Illiniwek were not performing authentic Native American dances, but routines they had learned from other non-Native hobbyists in the Boy Scouts of America. The Peoria people are the closest living descendants of the Illiniwek Confederacy. In response to requests by those who had portrayed the mascot to bring back occasional performances, Peoria Chief John P. Froman reaffirmed the tribe's position that Chief (Illiniwek) \\"was not in any way representative of Peoria culture\\". Conservative columnists often assert that outrage over mascots is manufactured by white liberals, rather than being the authentic voice of Native Americans. =Other team names and ethnic groups= Many argue there is a double standard in Native Americans being so frequently used as a sports team name or mascot when the same usage would be unthinkable for other racial or ethnic group. One current exception is the Coachella Valley High School \\"Arabs\\" which has also been the subject of controversy, resulting in the retirement of its more cartoonish representations. The University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette's \\"Ragin' Cajuns\\" are sometimes cited as counter-arguments to those that favor change. However, rather than referring to \\"others\\" these teams employ symbols that European American cultures have historically used to represent themselves. The University of Notre Dame mascot, the University of Notre Dame leprechaunNotre Dame Fighting Irish - Traditions: The Leprechaun , University of Notre Dame Athletics is a mythical being that represents the Irish, which is both an ethnic and a national group. The University of Louisiana at Lafayette mascot is an anthropomorphic cayenne pepper, an ingredient frequently found in Cajun cuisine. Opponents also see this argument as a false equivalency, because it ignores systemic inequality, and serves to discount the Native American voice by saying that if one group isn't hurt by a particular portrayal, then no group has the right to be hurt, regardless of vastly different backgrounds, treatment, and social positions. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights call for an end to the use of Native American mascots was only for non-native schools. In cases where universities were founded to educate Native Americans, such mascots may not be examples of cultural appropriation or stereotyping. Examples include the Fighting Indians of the Haskell Indian Nations University and the University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNCP), which continues to have a substantial number of native students, and close ties to the Lumbee tribe. The UNCP nickname is the Braves, but the mascot is a red-tailed hawk. Pembroke Middle School, which also has close ties to the Lumbee tribe, is nicknamed the Warriors. =Financial impact of change= Many supporters of Native American mascots feel that the financial cost of changing mascots would outweigh the benefits. Sales of merchandise with team mascots and nicknames generate millions of dollars in sales each year, and teams contend that a change in team mascots would render this merchandise useless. The cost of removing images from uniforms and all other items, which must be paid out of local school funds, is a greater factor for secondary schools. Opponents feel that despite the cost of a change in team mascots, it should be done to prevent what they believe is racial stereotyping. Clyde Bellecourt, when director of the American Indian Movement stated: \\"It's the behavior that accompanies all of this that's offensive. The rubber tomahawks, the chicken feather headdresses, people wearing war paint and making these ridiculous war whoops with a tomahawk in one hand and a beer in the other; all of these have significant meaning for us. And the psychological impact it has, especially on our youth, is devastating.\\" A study done by the Emory University Goizueta Business School indicates that the growing unpopularity of Native American mascots is a financial drain for professional teams, losing money compared to more popular animal mascots. Writing for Forbes in response to the statewide mascot ban passed by Maine in 2019, marketing analyst Henry DeVries compares Native mascots to the retired \\"Frito Bandito\\" mascot, and argues that \\"offensive marketing mascots\\" are a bad idea financially and \\"on the wrong side of history.\\" =Public opinion surveys= A survey conducted in 2002 by The Harris Poll for Sports Illustrated (SI) found that 81 percent of Native Americans who live outside traditional Indian reservations and 53 percent of Indians on reservations did not find the images discriminatory. The authors of the article concluded that \\"Although most Native American activists and tribal leaders consider Indian team names and mascots offensive, neither Native Americans in general nor a cross section of U.S. sports fans agree\\". According to the article, \\"There is a near total disconnect between Indian activists and the Native American population on this issue.\\" An Indian activist commented on the results saying \\"that Native Americans' self-esteem has fallen so low that they don't even know when they're being insulted\\". Soon after the SI article, a group of five social scientists experienced in researching the mascot issue published a journal article arguing against the validity of this survey and its conclusions. First they state that \\"The confidence with which the magazine asserts that a 'disconnect' between Native American activists and Native Americans exists on this issue belies the serious errors in logic and accuracy made in the simplistic labeling of Native Americans who oppose mascots as 'activists.'\\"King, C. Richard. The Native American Mascot Controversy: A Handbook p.268. (). Peter Harris Research Group. (2002) Methodology for Sports Illustrated survey on the use of Indian nicknames, mascots, etc. Document produced by The Peter Harris Research Group and shared with Ellen Staurowsky in January 2003. A flaw unique to polls of Native Americans is they rely upon self-identification to select the target population. In an editorial in the Bloomington Herald Times, Steve Russell (an enrolled Cherokee citizen and associate professor of criminal justice at Indiana University), states that both SI and Annenberg's samples of \\"self-identified Native Americans ... includes plenty of people who have nothing to do with Indians\\". Individuals claiming to be Native American when they are not is well known in academic research, and people claiming Indian identity specifically to gain authority in the debate over sports mascots has been criticised. At the Center for Indigenous Peoples Studies at California State University, San Bernardino a survey has conducted of 400 individuals whose identity as Native American was verified, finding that 67% agreed with the statement that \\"Redskins\\" is offensive and racist. The response from non-natives was almost the opposite, with 68% responding that the name is not offensive. In a 2020 study at UC Berkeley 49% of self-identified Native Americans responded that the Washington Redskins name was offensive or very offensive, while only 38% were not bothered by it. However, for study participants who were heavily engaged in their native or tribal cultures, 67% said they were offended, for young people 60%, and those with tribal affiliations 52%. Trends While protests began in the 1970s, national attention to the issue did not occur until widespread television coverage of college and professional games brought the behaviour of some fans to the attention of Native Americans. The appearance of the Atlanta Braves in the 1991 World Series and the Washington Redskins at the 1992 Super Bowl prompted the largest response because the games were played in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which has a large Native American population. The documents most often cited to justify the elimination of Native mascots are the advisory opinion by the United States Commission on Civil Rights in 2001 and a resolution by the American Psychological Association in 2005. Neither of these documents refer to subjective perceptions of offensiveness, but to scientific evidence of harms and legal definitions of discrimination. However, the issue is often discussed in the media in terms of feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated. Individual school districts have responded to complaints by local Native American individuals and tribes, or have made changes due to an increased awareness of the issue among educators and students. New Native mascots have not been proposed in recent decades, or are withdrawn before becoming official due to public opposition. For example, in 2016 when one of the teams in the National College Prospects Hockey League (NCPHL) was announced as the Lake Erie Warriors with a caricature Mohawk logo it was immediate changed to the Lake Erie Eagles. Little League International has updated its 2019 rulebook to include a statement prohibiting \\"the use of team names, mascots, nicknames or logos that are racially insensitive, derogatory or discriminatory in nature.\\" This decision has been applauded by the National Congress of American Indians. In February, 2019 US Lacrosse issued a position statement which said in part \\"As the sport’s national governing body, US Lacrosse believes that the misuse of Native American nicknames, logos, and mascots reflect and promote misleading stereotypes that are degrading and harmful to Native Americans. We will make every effort to assure that offensive or stereotypical mascots and logos will not be visible or promoted at events that US Lacrosse controls.\\" Legal and administrative action Statewide laws or school board decisions regarding team names and mascots have passed in states with significant Native American populations; including California (2015), Colorado (2014), Oregon (2012), and Michigan (2012). However, opposing the trend for change, in response to the Tennessee Commission of Indian Affairs seeking a ban though the Tennessee Human Rights Commission, the Tennessee Senate passed a law allowing only elected officials to take any action banning school teams using American Indian names and symbols. The Wisconsin law passed in 2010 meant to eliminate \\"race-based nicknames, logos and mascots\\" was revised in 2013 making change much more difficult. In the original law, a single individual could file a complaint with the burden of proof on the school to defend their mascot, in the new law a petition signed by 10% of the school district residents is needed, and the petitioners need to prove discrimination. Secondary schools and youth leagues Secondary schools in both the United States and Canada have had histories similar to colleges, some changing voluntarily while others maintain their current mascots. An analysis of a database in 2013 indicated that there were then more than 2,000 high schools with mascots that reference Native American culture, compared to around 3,000 fifty years prior. =Canada= The Department of Educational Foundations at the University of Saskatchewan passed a resolution calling for the retirement of all school mascots and logos that depict First Nations people. In addition to moving to changing their own mascots, school boards in Ontario are also considering a ban on students wearing any articles bearing offensive names or logos, be they professional or local teams. Ian Campeau, an Ojibway musician and activist in Ottawa, Ontario, filed a human rights complaint against the Nepean Redskins Football Club on behalf of his five-year-old daughter in an effort to get the team to change its name. \\"How are they going to differentiate the playing field from the school yard? What's going to stop them from calling my daughter a redskin in the school yard? That's as offensive as using the n-word.\\" Assembly of First Nations National Chief Shawn Atleo said he supports the move because the word Redskin is \\"offensive and hurtful and completely inappropriate. The team was changed to the \\"Nepean Eagles\\", chosen from 70 suggestions submitted. Niigaan Sinclair (Anishinaabe), a writer and assistant professor at the University of Manitoba, applauded the decision and contrasted it to the decision of Daniel Snyder, the Washington team owner. In 2017, the Swift Current Indians baseball club became the Swift Current 57's. =United States= In January, 2020 the school board of Killingly High School, Killingly, Connecticut, now with a Republican majority, voted to reinstate the Redmen mascot. The vote reflects a generational split, the new school board members representing mainly older alumni, while current students, faculty and Native Americans support changing the mascot. A senior active in the debate stated “We look racist...this is not what I want our school to be known for.” The mascot had been removed after input from the Nipmuc Tribal Council that no Native mascots are flattering. In October, \\"Red Hawks\\" was chosen initially as the new mascot, but after a contentious meeting in December the Board decided to have no mascot. Renewed discussion of whether the mascot is offensive had begun in June 2019, prompted by a student initiative. However, the name change became an issue in the 2019 municipal elections, leading to record turnout and Republican victories. After receiving statements in opposition to the \\"Indians\\" name from the Penobscot Nation and the ACLU of Maine, the school board voted in March 2019 to eliminate the mascot at Skowhegan Area High School. With the removal of Native American imagery associated with the \\"Warriors\\" name at other high schools, Maine becomes the first state to eliminate indigenous mascots in all secondary schools. A bill to ban Native American mascots in all public schools passed the Maine House of Representatives and Senate and was signed into law by Governor Janet Mills in May, 2019. Due to the media coverage of the Washington Redskins, high schools with the name Redskins have received particular attention, including three which have a majority of Native American students. Advocates for the name conclude that because some Native Americans use the name to refer to themselves, it is not insulting. However, the principal of one of these, Red Mesa High School in Teec Nos Pos, Arizona, said that use of the word outside American Indian communities should be avoided because it could perpetuate \\"the legacy of negativity that the term has created.\\" Relationships with tribes to retain Native names have been established at the high school level. Arapahoe High School (Centennial, Colorado) now uses a logo provided by the Arapaho Tribe of Wyoming, which initially included an agreement that the image would not be placed on the gym floor or any article of clothing. The latter provision has not always been observed, but the logo does not appear on the team uniforms. The agreement also includes tribal participation in school events. A similar agreement has been worked out between the Northern Arapahoe Tribe and the Strasburg High School \\" Indians\\" in Strasburg, Colorado. An exceptional case is the Salamanca Central High School \\"Warriors\\" in the city of Salamanca, New York. The city is within the boundaries of the Allegany Indian Reservation of the Seneca Nation of Indians, and 26% of the high school students are Native American. In 2001, when the commissioner of the New York State Education Department sent a letter to all New York school boards calling for the elimination of Native American mascots, the Seneca Nation Tribal Council joined with other members of the community in seeking to retain the Warrior imagery, although with individual differences of opinion. Salamanca may be unique in having a mixed but not fully integrated community, with the Warrior identity combining elements negotiated between the Seneca and non-Seneca population. For example, the school logo now depicts a Seneca man, replacing the stereotypical Plains Indian warrior image that was used prior to 1978. Colleges and universities 1930 football ticket stub depicting the former Stanford Indian mascot Some college teams voluntarily changed their names and mascots. Stanford University had \\"The Stanford Indian\\" as its mascot from 1930 to 1972. Today Stanford's athletic team identity is built around the \\"Stanford Cardinal\\", reflecting the primary school color that has been used from the earliest days, while the unofficial mascot shown on its primary logo is the Stanford Tree. Another early change was the \\"Saltine Warrior\\" that represented Syracuse University from 1931 until 1978. After a brief attempt to use a Roman warrior, the mascot became Otto the Orange for the school color. Miami University began discussion regarding the propriety of the Redskins name and images in 1972, and changed its team nickname to RedHawks in 1996. Although Dartmouth College had not used an Indian mascot for many years, Yale University printed a program for the 2016 game commemorating its 100th game against Dartmouth showing historical program covers featuring depictions of Native Americans that are now viewed as racist. The Florida State Seminoles of Florida State University use names and images associated with the Seminole people. The use is officially sanctioned by the Seminole Tribe of Florida even though the NCAA \\"continues to believe the stereotyping of Native Americans is wrong.\\" =National Collegiate Athletic Association= The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) distributed a \\"self evaluation\\" to 31 colleges in 2005, for teams to examine the use of potentially offensive imagery with their mascot choice. Nineteen teams were cited as having potentially \\"hostile or abusive\\" names, mascots, or images, that would be banned from displaying them during post-season play, and prohibited from hosting tournaments. Subsequently, all of the colleges previously using Native American imagery changed except for those granted waivers when they obtained official support from individual tribes based upon the principle of tribal sovereignty. San Diego State University (SDSU) was not cited by the NCAA in 2005 due to a decision that the Aztecs were not a Native American tribe with any living descendants. However, in February 2017 the SDSU Native American Student Alliance (NASA) supported removal of the mascot, calling its continued use \\"institutional racism\\" in its official statement to the Committee on Diversity, Equity and Outreach. A task force of students, faculty, and alumni was appointed to study the issue and make a recommendation by April, 2018. The recommendation was to keep the mascot but take steps to use only respectful references to Aztec culture, however there are few signs of this being implemented. Professional teamsCurrent usageAtlanta Braves The Braves's \\"Tomahawk Chop,\\" inspired by the tradition of the same name at Florida State University, is often encouraged through the dissemination of foam tomahawks at games and other events. The Atlanta Braves remain the home of the tomahawk chop (although it began at Florida State University). The logo has changed through the years from an Indian in full headdress to an Indian with a Mohawk hairstyle and single feather (described as either laughing or shouting), then to the Braves name in script over a tomahawk. The mascot Chief Noc-A-Homa was replaced in 1986 by a baseball-headed \\"Homer the Brave\\", and in 2018 by \\"Blooper\\". The tomahawk chop and the accompanying chant has not been without controversy. In February, 2019 after the removal of the Cleveland Indians' Chief Wahoo logo, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said \\"The Braves have taken steps to take out the tomahawk chop\\". In October, St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Ryan Helsley, a member of the Cherokee Nation, stated his belief that the tomahawk chop and chant misrepresents Native Americans. In response to this complaint, the Atlanta Braves, in their October 9 game against the Cardinals, did not provide fans with foam tomahawks, although the music accompanying the chant was played while fans performed the arm gesture. When the Braves lost to the Cardinals 13-1, the San Francisco Bay Area Fox affiliate used the headline \\"Braves Scalped\\", drawing criticism as an example of why most Native Americans oppose the use of American Indian imagery and mascots in sports. The station soon apologized. The team front office has stated that there will be talks with Native Americans during the off-season regarding the tomahawk chop tradition, while leaders of two tribes that once inhabited Georgia, the Cherokee and the Muscogee (Creek) Nation agree that the tradition is inappropriate. In July 2020, Richard Sneed, the Principal Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, released a statement about the tribe's conversations with the Braves. The statement said the EBCI believed \\"that candid, thoughtful conversations are crucial to educating leaders and bringing about positive change.\\" The EBCI statement also applauded \\"the Braves’ willingness to engage in this effort and look forward to continuing to build the relationship the EBCI shares with them to present a model for how other professional sports teams can work with Native Nations in a respectful and constructive manner.\\" Sneed also stated that he is not offended by the name Braves or the tomahawk chop cheer, but respects the opinion of those who feel differently. However, Sneed was still openly critical of usage of the word \\"Redskins\\" among sports teams. Chicago Blackhawks Native American rights advocate Suzan Shown Harjo (Cheyenne and Hodulgee Muscogee) says the Chicago Blackhawks have escaped the scrutiny given to other teams using Native imagery because hockey is not a cultural force on the level of football. But she says national American Indian organizations have called for an end to all Indian-related mascots and that she found the hockey team's name and Indian head symbol to be offensive. \\"It lacks dignity,\\" she said. \\"There's dignity in a school being named after a person or a people. There's dignity in a health clinic or hospital. There's nothing dignified in something being so named (that is used for) recreation or entertainment or fun.\\" The National Congress of American Indians also opposes the Blackhawks' logo, as it does all Native American mascots. In 2019, the American Indian Center of Chicago ended all ties to the Chicago Blackhawks Foundation, stating they will no longer affiliate \\"with organizations that perpetuate stereotypes through the use of \\"Indian\\" mascots.\\" The AIC noted in its statement that they \\"previously held a relationship with the Chicago Blackhawks Foundation with the intention of educating the general public about American Indians and the use of logos and mascots. The AIC, along with members of the community have since decided to end this relationship\\" and stated that \\"going forward, AIC will have no professional ties with the Blackhawks, or any other organization that perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\\"https://aicchicago.org/statement-aic-ends-ties-with-chicago- blackhawks-foundation/https://aicchicago.org/statement-on-blackhawks/ While stating they will retain their name after the decision by the Washington Football Team to change theirs, the Blackhawks did agree to ban Native American headdresses at home games in recognition of their status as sacred symbols. Before the ban was enacted, there had in fact been incidents where some Blackhawk fans wore headdresses. Cleveland Indians Venezuelan Omar Vizquel wearing a baseball cap showing the image of Chief Wahoo The Cleveland Indians acknowledged on July 3, 2020 that they are ready to discuss changing their team name in the wake of news that the Washington Redskins would be reviewing theirs. Starting in the 2019 season, the Chief Wahoo logo did not appear on uniforms nor on stadium signs, although it will still be licensed for team merchandise within the Cleveland area. Local groups say they will continue to advocate for a change of the team name, and object to the continued sale outside the stadium of merchandise with the Wahoo image. Chief Wahoo is part of an exhibit at the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia maintained by Ferris State University in Michigan. For Dr. David Pilgrim, a sociology professor at Ferris State and an expert in racial imagery, the symbol is a \\"red Sambo\\" that hardly differs from the caricatures of blacks popular in the Jim Crow era in which Wahoo was created, when such depictions of minority races were popularly used to inflame prejudice and justify discriminatory laws and behavior. Pilgrim explains how the exaggerated features serve their discriminatory purpose by emphasizing the differences of the depicted race, thereby reinforcing the idea that the caricatured race is inferior. Kansas City Chiefs In 1963 the Kansas City Chiefs adopted their name when the Dallas Texans (AFL) relocated. \\"Chiefs\\" was not a direct reference to Native Americans, but to Kansas City mayor Harold Roe Bartle who was instrumental in bringing the Texans to Kansas City, Missouri. Bartle earned his nickname as founder of a Boy Scouts honor camping society, Tribe of Mic-O-Say, in which he was \\"Chief\\" Lone Bear. Bartle had been known by the nickname as a prominent Kansas City businessman, so it soon became the unavoidable name for the team. In spite of attempts to downplay Native American associations, fan behavior such as the tomahawk chop and wearing face paint and headdresses drew criticism. In 1989 the Chiefs switched from Warpaint, a Pinto horse ridden by a man in a feathered headdress, to their current mascot K. C. Wolf. Warpaint returned in 2009, but is ridden by a cheerleader. The Chiefs drew little attention compared to other teams until 2013, when photographs of fans in \\"Indian\\" dress appeared in the Kansas City Star. In 2014 the Star reported that the team's management planned discussions with some Native American groups to find a non-confrontational way to eliminate, or at least reduce, offensive behavior. Achieving greater visibility by reaching the playoffs in 2016, Native Americans at Haskell Indian Nations University in Lawrence, Kansas are asking the Chiefs to stop behavior that invokes stereotypes, such as wearing headdresses and doing the \\"tomahawk chop\\". In a statistical analysis of social media comments (tweets) leading up to Super Bowl LIV, researchers found many more negative terms associated with the Kansas City team compared to San Francisco. While both teams were referred to in terms related to violence, the Chiefs were much more likely to receive insults related to intelligence (being called stupid) and many insults were specific references to negative Native American stereotypes, such as drunkenness (\\"firewater\\"), and being inbred or extinct. The conclusion drawn was support for Natives being insulted, rather than honored, by Native American mascots. On August 20, 2020 the Chiefs announced that headdresses and Native American style face paint would be banned at Arrowhead Stadium. The ban officially went into effect during the 2020 season opener on September 10, 2020.The Tomahawk chop also underwent a subtle modification, as Arrowhead- based cheerleaders are now required to lead the chop with a closed fist rather than the traditional open palm. While fans said they will not change their behavior, a Native activist said that the chop should be eliminated entirely. =Prior usage= Several teams changed when they moved to other cities, while others went out of business. The Atlanta Hawks were originally the Tri- Cities Blackhawks (using an \\"Indian\\" logo), and the Clippers were originally the Buffalo Braves. The United States national rugby league team was known as the Tomahawks until 2015, when USA Rugby League replaced the American National Rugby League as the sport's governing body in the U.S. and chose the simpler Hawks as the new name for the team. Edmonton Eskimos In part because they do not use any native imagery, the Edmonton Eskimos were rarely mentioned with regard to the controversy. However Natan Obed, the President of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Canada's national Inuit organization, has stated that \\"Eskimo is not only outdated, it is now largely considered a derogatory term\\" and is a \\"relic of colonial power\\". The editorial board of the Toronto Star sees a name change as the inevitable result of social evolution, and reflecting respect for indigenous peoples. However, after a year of considering alternatives, the team decided in February 2020 to retain the name finding no consensus among Native groups including the Inuit. However, on July 16, 2020, it was reported that the club will be dropping the 'Eskimos' name. On July 21, the team officially retired the name, and temporarily began using \\"Edmonton Football Team\\" and \\"EE Football Team\\" until a new name is decided. Golden State Warriors The Golden State Warriors eliminated Native American imagery as the team relocated. Originally the Philadelphia Warriors (1946-1962), their logo was a cartoon Native American dribbling a basketball. When they moved to San Francisco, the logo became a Native American headdress (1962-1968). Washington Redskins The Washington Redskins received the most public attention due to the prominence of the team being located in the nation's capital, and the name itself being defined in current dictionaries of American English as \\"usually offensive\\", \\"disparaging\\", \\"insulting\\", and \\"taboo\\". Native American opposition to the name began in the early 1970s with letters to the owner of the team and the editors of The Washington Post. National protests began in 1988, after the team's Super Bowl XXII victory, and again when the 1992 Super Bowl between the Redskins and the Buffalo Bills was held in Minnesota. Those officially censuring and/or demanding the name be changed include more than 80 organizations that represent various groups of Native Americans. When the Redskins participated in \\"Blackout Tuesday\\" on June 2, 2020, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded \\"Want to really stand for racial justice? Change your name.\\" Subsequently, Mayor Muriel Bowser interrelated her position that the name is an impediment to the team's return to a stadium in the District of Columbia. A statue of the team's founder, George Preston Marshall has been removed from the grounds of RFK Stadium after being spray painted with the words \\"Change the Name\\". The management of the stadium stated that the statue would not return, and that its removal was long overdue. In the following week, the team removed all mention of Marshall from the team's other facilities and website. In July 2020, amidst the removal of many names and images as part of the George Floyd protests, a group of investors worth $620 billion wrote letters to major sponsors Nike, FedEx and PepsiCo encouraging pressure on the Redskins to change their name. FedEx called on the team to change its name on July 2, 2020. The same day, Nike removed Redskins apparel from its website. On July 3, the league and the franchise announced that it was \\"undergoing a thorough review of the team name.\\" On July 7, it was acknowledged that the Redskins were not in contact with a group of Native Americans who petitioned the NFL to force a name change and that Redskins head coach Ron Rivera also stated the team wanted to continue “honoring and supporting Native Americans and our Military.” On July 13, 2020 the team made an official statement that their review would result in the retirement of the Redskins name and logo. On July 23, 2020 the team announced that they will be called the Washington Football Team with a block \\"W\\" logo for the 2020 season. Other issues=Stereotyping by rival fans In addition to the behavior of the teams that have Native American names or mascots, their rivals often invoke racist stereotypes. In December 2013 when the Washington Redskins played the Kansas City Chiefs an employee of a Sonic Drive-In in Missouri placed a message outside that used scalping, reservations and whiskey to disparage the \\"Redskins\\". It was quickly removed with the owner's apologies. A rubber severed \\"Indian\\" head impaled on a knife has been used by a sports fan in Philadelphia to taunt rival teams with Native American mascots. There have been a number of incidents of rival high school teams displaying banners or signs referencing the Trail of Tears, which have been criticized for both insensitivity and ignorance of history. Although the Central Michigan Chippewas have the support of the Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation of Michigan, a student at rival Western Michigan University designed a T-shirt showing a Native American behind bars with the legend \\"Caught a Chippewa about a week ago\\". It was quickly condemned by both university presidents, who agreed that anyone wearing the shirt at a game would be ejected. In spite of the University of North Dakota changing their nickname from the Fighting Sioux to the Fighting Hawks, students at rival North Dakota State University (NDSU) continue to chant \\"Sioux suck shit\\" whenever their football team makes a first down. The NDSU president, along with the presidents of the student body and faculty senates, have called for an end to the practice, which they describe as hateful, and coming from a misplaced sense of tradition. Some NDSU fans also wear T-shirts with graphics depicting variations on the \\"Sioux suck\\" theme. Varying degrees of offensiveness To further complicate this controversy, many feel that there are varying levels of offensiveness with team names and mascots. The nature and degree of stereotyping varies depending upon the name of the team, the logo, the mascot, and the behavior of fans. The greatest offense is taken when the logo and mascot are caricatures viewed as insulting, such as the Cleveland Indians' Chief Wahoo; the name of the team is often regarded as a racial slur, such as Redskins or Squaws; or the behavior of the mascot or fans is based upon popular images of Indians which trivialize authentic native cultures, such as the tomahawk chop. The practices of individual schools and teams have changed in response to the controversy. A local example is Washington High School in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Many Native American images have been removed, and the \\"Warriors\\" nickname is now claimed to be generic. The school now has a \\"circle of courage\\" logo with eagle feathers and has also \\"updated\\" the murals of Chief Hollow Horn Bear in the gym. Duane Hollow Horn Bear, the chief's great-grandson, who teaches Lakota language and history at Sinte Gleska University in Mission, stated: \\"We had no objection to their utilizing those pictures as long as my great- grandfather was represented with honor and dignity.\\" However, not all Native Americans are happy with the presence of any such images. Teams outside the Americas Native American names and images are used by teams in other countries, generally those playing American-style sports and copying the imagery of American teams. Several are in countries that also have a tradition of Native American hobbyists often associated with the popularity of the stories written by German author Karl May.

A festival acquisition executive-produced by Roger Corman, it is a low budget independent film with a cast consisting primarily of unknown actors, and representing June Allyson's final role in film. The project was filmed using Sony's HD-CAM format. Distribution was subsequently acquired by Disney and the film was released on video as A Girl, Three Guys, and a Gun (a.k.a. A Girl, 3 Guys and a Gun). Plot Frank (Brent Florence) is a Northern California 20-year-old who has just been dumped by his girlfriend. He and his slacker buddies Joey (Kenny Luper) and Neil (Christian Leffler) want to escape their small town but lack the funds.

Following the Cinequest screening, Variety generally panned the film. While noting June Allyson's part in the project, and finding the film's technical aspects as acceptable, they found the film's humor as quirky and lame, its otherwise serious themes feebly handled, and its leads as poor casting choices who failed to convince viewers as \\"local yokels\\". They wrote it was a \\"wan replay of the already derivative youthful-buddy-caper hijinx in indies like Bottle Rocket and Palookaville, Solid Ones offers tepid comedy and vague, touchy-feely dramatics, making for an inconsequential feature debut from writer-helmer-star Brent Florence.

DVD Talk granted that filmmaker \\"Brent Florence clearly did his homework\\", due to the film being \\"just a bit more polished and streamlined than many of its ilk\\", but felt that the characters were not believable when writing they were \\"all transparent puppets for the scattershot screenplay, which wants to balance playfulness, danger, and sincerity, but fails with a disappointing consistency\\". Their acting was good but failed by being \\"in service of a half- baked plot, some fairly tired comedy schtick, and a handful of seriously over- familiar themes.\\" The film had its video premiere 4 December 2001 under the title A Girl, Three Guys, and a Gun.

Jared swindles Nash Brennan at a game of poker and buys Antonio Vega's shares of Nash's vineyard; it revealed that he shares a secret past with Nash's wife (and Natalie's fraternal twin) Jessica Buchanan. Jessica's former alternate personality Tess had been responsible for sending Jared to prison, thus ruining his chances at a good business job. Jared wants revenge on Jessica, believing that she had set him up and not believing that \\"Tess\\" had ever existed. Asa had died on August 16, 2007, soon after Jared's arrival in town; Jared befriends Asa's widow Renee, who claims to see much of her husband in Jared. Soon Asa's son Clint and butler Nigel -- and later most of the family -- are suspicious of Jared's motives. Jared and Natalie are attracted to each other, but she also is less-than-trusting of his motives and angry at his manipulations with her family. Jared boldly kisses Natalie at work, and she fires him. Jared arrives at Nash and Jessica's cottage with proof that he owns it as part of his stake in the vineyard, and proceeds to move in. Natalie re-hires him to get him to leave. To Natalie's chagrin, Jared kisses Natalie's niece/cousin Sarah Roberts at Capricorn, and the Buchanans are shocked as Renee invites Jared to stay at Asa's mansion. Jared and Sarah have a date at the Palace Hotel restaurant, watched by an irritated Natalie and Cristian Vega, who is protective of Sarah and later romantically interested in her. Natalie warns Sarah about Jared, but Sarah is undeterred; when the time comes for the reading of Asa's will in Paris, Texas, Sarah invites Jared to come with her -- which annoys Natalie, Jessica and Nash. Sarah soon realizes that her heart is with Cristian, and Jared and Natalie give in to their attraction and share several kisses. The Buchanan heir In his will, Asa had revealed the existence of another son, but had left the man unnamed and had tasked Nigel to reveal his identity when the time was right. Jared overhears Nigel say that David Vickers is secretly Asa's son; knowing that Nigel is reluctant to tell the family that con artist David is one of them, Jared soon blackmails Nigel into convincing the family that he is Asa's long-lost son. Nigel initially refuses, but eventually gives in; he gives a forged letter to Asa's sons Clint and Bo in which Asa names Jared as his son. Despite his feelings for Natalie, Jared moves his plan forward; he pretends to act surprised at being Asa's son and even unhappy about the idea -- though he secures some of David's hair to pass the inevitable DNA test. However, Jared's real father Charlie Banks -- who has been searching for him -- shows up at the mansion. Charlie, a recovering alcoholic, is apologetic for his failures as a parent and hopes to reconnect with his son; a bitter Jared is unwilling to let Charlie back in his life. Asa's ex-wife Pamela Stuart is summoned to Llanview by Bo on January 18, 2008 and attends the Buchanan Enterprises board meeting to weigh in on the possibility that Jared is Asa's illegitimate son. Bo had determined that Asa had been with Pamela around the time of Jared's conception; Pamela confirms that Asa had never even met Jared's mother Valerie Banks, let alone conceived a child with her. To the shock of everyone assembled, Pamela reveals that Valerie had in fact been her sister; Pamela then drops the bombshell that she is actually Jared's biological mother. Afraid of losing Asa's love by bringing a child into the relationship, Pamela had asked Valerie to secretly adopt Asa's son. Pamela declares him the Buchanan heir; after the board meeting lets out, however, Pamela returns to meet with Jared alone. It is revealed that Pamela has lied to the Buchanans and is merely going along with Jared's scheme; Pamela is not really Jared's mother, but has known Jared and his family since he was a child, and had told the young boy many stories about her life with Asa. Through Pamela's stories of the great Asa Buchanan, Jared's fascination with Asa and the Buchanan clan had been born. Jared had not been aware that Pamela was going to appear at the meeting or lie for him, but Pamela explains that it was the least she could do \\"after everything my brother\\" -- a violent abuser who dated Jared's mother after Charlie left the Banks household -- \\"did to you and your family.\\"The February 1, 2008 episode included a flashback that reveals that Jared and Valerie had been abused by some of her boyfriends after Charlie had left the Banks household, and the February 15, 2008 episode Jared confirms that one of the abusers had been Pamela's brother. Pamela, who still remembers Jared with fondness, warmly wishes him good luck with the company, and tells him that -- whether he realizes it or not -- what he is doing is not about the money or the power, but about the Buchanans, and their good name. Jared and Natalie continue to fight their now-forbidden attraction to each other. Charlie is not happy with Jared's scheme, but vows to protect his son's secret as part of his attempt to reconcile with Jared. Soon Charlie, who is romantically involved with Natalie's mother Viki Davidson, notices Jared's attraction to Natalie and tells his son he can either be the Buchanan heir or be with Natalie -- but not both. In the February 15, 2008 episode, Jared indicates that he has at least one sibling when he relates to Charlie the abuse they and their mother had suffered after Charlie had left them. In the March 21, 2008 episode, Jared and Charlie discuss how during that time Jared's younger brother Jimmy had been hit by a car and killed. Though Valerie had told Charlie it had been an accident, Jared reveals that Jimmy had actually been overwrought because of their mother's abusive boyfriend; Jared blames himself for letting an upset Jimmy run out into the street. In March 2008, Jared finally admits to a shocked Natalie that he is not a Buchanan and that David Vickers is. Jared hopes that he and Natalie can now be together, but she rejects him, deciding to keep his secret only to protect her family from David's greed. Eventually they fall into bed together on May 5, 2008. Jared later tells Natalie that Charlie is his father, and they agree to keep the secret to protect Viki and assure Charlie's sobriety. On November 9, 2008, Charlie saves Jared and Natalie's lives from a bomb that Natalie's sister Jessica set when she was her dangerous alter, Tess had set. Jared thinks Charlie is dead and through tears, he tells Natalie he never got a chance to tell Charlie how much he loved him. Then, Charlie stumbles through the door, dusty and sooty but alive. Jared proposes to Natalie on Christmas morning 2008, and she agrees to be his wife. They marry privately on May 13, 2009. When someone is stalking Jessica to whom she thinks is her late husband Nash's spirit, John McBain suspects Jared as her stalker, much to Natalie's disapproval. When Jared went missing, Natalie and Jessica flew to Napa Valley, California to find him and they soon found out about Mitch Laurence's return from the dead, where he held the three captive. John and Brody Lovett flew to the vineyard to rescue them and when, after Mitch lays down on his knees from John's orders, Mitch shoots Jared. Jared was immediately taken to the hospital, where he was later pronounced dead, breathing his last before he could finish telling Natalie something.

Description The tall shrub reaching in height or tree to in height has an erect to spreading habit with grey-black or grey-brown coloured bark that can be smooth or rough. The glabrous branchlets are angled toward the apices. It has phyllodes instead of true leaves which have two prominent veins (giving the plant its species name binervata). The evergreen phyllodes have a narrowly elliptic to broadly elliptic or occasionally lanceolate shape and are straight or sometimes subfalcate with a length of and a width of . It blooms between August and November producing inflorescences that occur in groups of three to twelve in the axillary racemes. The spherical flower-heads have a diameter of and contain 30 to 50 pale yellow to almost white coloured flowers. The firmly papery to leathery seed pods that form after flowering are straight and flat and can be constricted between the seeds. The pods are in length and wide with longitudinally arranged seeds inside. The shiny black seeds have an oblong- elliptic shape with a length of around and with a black aril. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1825 as part of the work Leguminosae. Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis. It was later reclassified as Racosperma binervatum in 1987 by Leslie Pedley then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2014. The only other synonym is Acacia umbrosa. Distribution The plant is found down the east coast of Australia from south east Queensland through much of coastal New South Wales. It is found from around Narooma in southern New South Wales to around Mittagong in the west up to around the Mount Tambourine area in southern Queensland. It grows moist sites in sandy or basaltic soils as a part of tall sclerophyll forest or on the margins of rainforest communities. Cultivation The plant can be grown from seed, though the seed must be scarified prior to planting. It is a hardy and fast growing plant that copes well in damp areas and prefers full sun or part shade positions. It is a dense shade tree or shelter tree or hedge that is frost hardy.

She was constructed for the United States Navy during World War II and her assignment was to provide liquids, such as fuel or water, to ships in the forward battle areas. She survived this dangerous task and returned home post-war with five battle stars to her credit. Aucilla was laid down on 25 May 1943 at Sparrows Point, Maryland, by the Bethlehem Steel Co. under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 722); launched on 20 November 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Hope Ridings Miller; and commissioned on 22 December 1943, Comdr. Cornelius M. Sullivan in command. World War II=North Atlantic operations The oiler remained at Sparrows Point until 28 December at which time she got underway for Portsmouth, Virginia. She arrived at the Norfolk Navy Yard on the 29th and began training the crew at battle stations and loading ammunition. Aucilla continued her training both in port and underway in the lower Chesapeake Bay. On 2 February 1944, she departed Norfolk in company with the destroyer on her way to the British West Indies. The oiler arrived at the Naval Operating Base (NOB), Trinidad, on 7 February and began dispensing fuel to warships operating in the vicinity. She remained there until 14 March at which time she put to sea, in convoy, for Aruba. Aucilla arrived at her destination on 16 March, took on a cargo of aviation gasoline, and departed Aruba on 17 March. After a stop at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the oiler arrived in Norfolk, Virginia, on 24 March. Convoyed to the United Kingdom For about a month, she operated out of Norfolk in the lower Chesapeake Bay testing fueling at sea gear and techniques. On 26 April, Aucilla departed Norfolk in company with the destroyer and, five days later, arrived in Baytown, Texas. After taking on a cargo of fuel, the ship stood out of Baytown on 4 May and arrived at Staten Island, New York, on the 8th. On 14 May, she was underway, in convoy, for the British Isles. The oiler parted company with the convoy on 25 May and entered port at Liverpool, England, that same day. She discharged her cargo on 27 May and got underway for Ireland the next day. She visited Belfast Lough from 29 May to 5 June and then headed back to the United States. Aucilla arrived at Norfolk on 16 June. Six days after her arrival, the oiler sailed from Norfolk for New York. She arrived on 23 June and operated in that locale until the end of the month. On 2 July, Aucilla put to sea bound for Europe once again. She returned to Belfast on 12 July but stopped only briefly, returning to sea that same day. The oiler visited Swansea, Wales, between 13–16 July before heading home via Belfast. She reentered Hampton Roads on 27 July. There, she stayed for almost a month. On 22 August, Aucilla put to sea in company with the destroyer bound for Baytown, Texas. She took on a cargo of fuel oil at Baytown before returning to sea. The ship arrived at Bermuda on 3 September and unloaded her cargo. She then headed back to Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she dropped anchor on 8 September. Operations in Chesapeake Bay followed. Transfer to the Pacific Fleet On 4 October, Aucilla put to sea bound for the Caribbean. She arrived at Aruba on 9 October and loaded fuel oil until 11 October when she set sail for Panama. The oiler transited the Panama Canal on 13 October and, the following day, departed Balboa, Panama, for the Hawaiian Islands. She stopped over at Pearl Harbor from 26 to 29 October and then continued her voyage west. The ship anchored in Eniwetok lagoon on 5 November. She spent the next two days unloading her cargo of fuel before continuing on to Ulithi on 7 November. There, she reported for duty to the Commander, Service Squadron (ServRon) 10. Supporting Iwo Jima and Okinawa operations For the remainder of the war, Aucilla supported U.S. 3rd Fleet/U.S. 5th Fleet operations in the western Pacific Ocean by refueling its units at sea. She provided fuel to the 3rd Fleet during its air attacks on Luzon in mid-December 1944 and again at the end of the first week in January 1945. When the 3rd Fleet entered the South China Sea in mid-January, Aucilla continued her fueling rendezvous with its warships. Between 15 and 26 February, she steamed in an area off Iwo Jima providing logistics support for the 5th Fleet. She fueled that same fleet from 16 March to 4 May during the invasion of Okinawa. The oiler rounded out her wartime service supporting the 3rd Fleet on its final series of raids on the Japanese home islands between 11 July and 15 August. End-of-war activity Following the cessation of hostilities, Aucilla continued steaming with the 3rd Fleet off Japan. After a brief stop at Ulithi, she set sail for Japan on 27 September. The oiler entered Tokyo Bay on 2 October—one month to the day after Japan formally surrendered. The oiler performed extensive occupation duty at various locations in the Far East between the end of the war and the summer of 1947. thumb Supporting nuclear test ships at Bikini That service also included some logistics support work for the ships of Joint Task Force 1, the task organization engaged in the atomic bomb tests conducted at Bikini Atoll during the summer of 1946. The western Pacific cruise in the summer and fall of 1948 ended with Aucilla steaming through the Indian Ocean, the Suez Canal, and the Mediterranean before she crossed the Atlantic to join the fleet stationed on the eastern seaboard of the United States. East Coast operations For about four years, the oiler operated along the U.S. East Coast, in the Gulf of Mexico, and in the Caribbean taking on oil at various oil ports and carrying it to the fleet. She also conducted independent ship's exercises and amphibious exercises both at Vieques Island near Puerto Rico and at Onslow Beach in North Carolina. At this time she was attached to MSTS. In 1950 she was deployed to Sasebo Japan to support the Korean War operation. She left Norfolk,Va in October 1950, where she was in for repairs at the Portsmouth Navy yard. Her home port was Mare Island Ca. She steamed through the Med. down through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea and up into the Persian Gulf to Ras Tanura where she loaded bunker oil. Leaving this port she headed through the Indian Ocean, the Straights of Molacca, around Singapore and headed North for Sasebo where she unloaded her cargo. Headed south again to Bahrain for another load of oil. Again leaving, headed for Sasebo once again. Arriving Sasebo and unloading she headed for Pearl Harbor. leaving Pearl harbor and returning to Sasebo, Japan. She returned to San Francisco and was detached from MSTS and attached to the fleet as a fleet tanker. Returning to Norfolk via the Panama Canal, completing her round the world voyage and assumed her duties a fleet tanker. In June 1952, Aucilla embarked upon the first of a long series of deployments to the Mediterranean. Four months later, she resumed operations along the eastern seaboard and in the West Indies. The first part of 1953 saw the oiler engaged in another series of training evolutions in the Puerto Rico- Vieques Island area. Midshipman cruise to Rio June and July 1953 brought a midshipman cruise which took her to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Barbados in the British West Indies. In September, Aucilla deployed to the Mediterranean Sea once more. She completed that assignment late in January 1954 and returned to Norfolk on 3 February 1954. Following post-deployment standdown and participation in the annual fleet exercise, Operation Springboard, the oiler resumed fuel services for the U.S. 2nd Fleet from her base at Norfolk, Virginia. May brought rough weather fueling tests in the North Atlantic followed by a two-month overhaul at a civilian shipyard in Baltimore, Maryland. Caribbean operations In August, Aucilla departed Baltimore and steamed down Chesapeake Bay to rejoin the active units of the Atlantic Fleet. She performed normal logistics services and training operations out of Norfolk until November. Late that month, the oiler put to sea for Gonaïves, Haiti, to provide support for some unspecified tests conducted by the Operational Development Force for the Bureau of Ordnance. In the course of those operations, the oiler visited Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Port-au-Prince, Haiti. When the ship returned to the United States early in December, she entered the Bethlehem Shipyard at Hoboken, New Jersey, for a three-month modification and repair period. Between mid-April and early May 1955, Aucilla completed refresher training out of Newport, Rhode Island. She then returned to Norfolk where she began preparations for an extended tour of duty with the 6th Fleet. Service in the Mediterranean Sea=Homeported in Barcelona, Spain On 31 May 1955 the ship stood out of Norfolk en route to her new home port, Barcelona, Spain. She reached her destination on 20 June. For the next 22 months, Aucilla served with Task Force (TF) 63 in a logistics support role. She participated in a number of exercises and visited ports all along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. On 2 April 1957, the oiler headed back to the United States. She spent the entire summer of 1957 engaged in repairs, first a four-month regular overhaul at the New York Naval Shipyard and then boiler repairs at Key Highway Shipyard of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, in Baltimore, Maryland. Between 16 September and 27 October, Aucilla completed refresher training—out of Guantanamo Bay—and post-refresher availability. Supporting landings in Lebanon On 28 October 1957, she set sail from Norfolk on her way back to the Mediterranean Sea. Once again, she spent her time ranging the length and breadth of the Mediterranean supporting the operations of TF 63. During the summer of 1958, Aucilla provided logistics support for the ships, sailors, and marines involved in the landings in Lebanon earned out in order to help restore order after severe factional fighting. Following that interlude, the oiler resumed normal U.S. 6th Fleet operations. On 30 May 1959, Aucilla headed back to the United States for a regular overhaul at the Boston Naval Shipyard. The overhaul lasted about six months. During that time, the oiler received a new home port assignment, Norfolk. The ship completed overhaul and set sail from Boston on 18 November, bound for refresher training in the Guantanamo Bay operating area. She shaped a course from the West Indies back to Norfolk on 16 December and arrived at her destination in time to spend the holidays there. Continued support of the 6th Fleet Underway again on 4 January 1960, Aucilla operated in the vicinity of Norfolk until late in the month. On the 28th, she put to sea bound for the Mediterranean Sea. That seven-month deployment followed the pattern of previous ones, mixing port visits with logistics missions in support of 6th Fleet combat units. The oiler returned to Norfolk on 31 August and, after the usual leave and upkeep period, resumed normal east coast-West Indies operations. That routine lasted into 1961. In February and March 1961, she participated in the annual fleet exercise Operation Springboard. She returned to Norfolk on 17 March and began preparations for another tour of duty with the 6th Fleet. On 15 May 1961, she stood out of Norfolk and shaped a course for the Mediterranean Sea. Aucilla served a 14-week deployment that followed patterns established earlier. Yard Overhaul at Norfolk The oiler reentered Norfolk on 11 September 1961 and began post-deployment standdown. Following the leave and upkeep period, she started preparations for overhaul. On 20 November, she entered the yard at the Norfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. Aucilla completed her overhaul on 20 February 1962 and then set sail on 1 March for five weeks of refresher training in the West Indies. Upon completion of refresher training, the oiler joined an underway replenishment group to support the amphibious Exercise \\"Phiblex 1-62\\", also conducted in the West Indies. Later, she returned to United States' waters to participate in Fleet Exercise \\"Quick Kick.\\" That summer, she conducted a midshipman training cruise and took part in convoy exercises off the eastern seaboard. European tour of duty The oiler continued operations out of Norfolk through the end of 1962 and into 1963. On 7 March 1963, Aucilla left Chesapeake Bay on her way back to the Mediterranean. The deployment lasted just under four months. She was back in Norfolk by 1 July. Following post-deployment standdown, the oiler got underway on 6 August to participate in NATO Exercise \\"Riptide IV\\" conducted in the eastern Atlantic. As an adjunct to that mission, she visited Bremerhaven, Germany, and Rota, Spain, before returning to Norfolk on 11 September. For the remainder of 1963, Aucilla conducted local operations out of her home port. Visiting the 1964 New York World's Fair Similar duty occupied her time during the first two months of 1964. On 3 March 1964, however, the oiler entered the yard at the Norfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. for a regular overhaul. She completed repairs and modifications late in June and put to sea on 29 March for a month of refresher training in the Guantanamo Bay operating area. At the conclusion of refresher training, Aucilla voyaged north to New York where her crew members visited the World's Fair. The ship returned to Norfolk on 8 August and resumed local operations. That resumption lasted just one month. On 8 September, Aucilla got underway from Norfolk once more to participate in a series of NATO exercises in the eastern Atlantic. She visited Bremerhaven, Germany, again at the end of the exercises early in October. She returned to Norfolk on 23 October 1964. Reassigned to the 6th Fleet Upon her return to her home port, she began preparations for another assignment with the 6th Fleet. Aucilla left Norfolk on 27 November and arrived in Rota, Spain, on 8 December. Another standard 6th Fleet tour of duty ensued with Aucilla fueling units of the fleet, participating in exercises, and visiting Mediterranean ports. She concluded the deployment with her arrival back in Norfolk on 11 May 1965. From late June to late July, Aucilla cruised the waters of the West Indies in support of U.S. 2nd Fleet units keeping an eye on the latest crisis to trouble the Dominican Republic. Supporting Gemini space shots She returned to Norfolk on 23 July and resumed local operations out of her home port. Those operations included support roles in the Gemini 6 and Gemini 7 space shots during October, November, and December. Aucilla reentered Norfolk on 23 December to begin her holiday leave and upkeep period. Further upkeep and a tender availability period occupied her time during January and February 1966. Early in March, the oiler put to sea for another cruise with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. She arrived in Cartagena, Spain, on 15 March and, for the next five months, provided logistics support for United States naval forces in the Mediterranean. Aucilla departed Rota, Spain, on 12 August and set a course for home. The oiler arrived in Norfolk on the 22d and remained there in a leave and upkeep status until the middle of October. Assigned recovery ship for Titan IIIC heat shield She put to sea again on 18 October to serve as a recovery ship for a U.S. Air Force Titan III-C heat shield qualification test. She returned to Norfolk from that mission on 21 November and remained in port for the rest of the year. Responding to the Six-Day Arab-Israeli War On 6 February 1967, Aucilla stood out of Norfolk once again on her way to the Mediterranean. She arrived in Rota, Spain, on the 17th and soon began making the rounds to ports in the \\"middle sea.\\" The most notable event of that deployment was the Six-Day Arab-Israeli War to which units of the 6th Fleet -- Aucilla included—responded with alacrity. She and her colleagues moved quickly to the eastern Mediterranean early in June, out the rapidity with which the Arab forces collapsed allowed them to return to a more normal routine at mid-month. Thus, the oiler resumed port visits, exercise, and fueling operations. She completed turnover proceedings at Rota on 19 and 20 August and headed back to the United States on the latter day. Aucilla arrived back in Norfolk on 30 August. After post-deployment standdown, the oiler entered the yard at the Norfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. for regular overhaul on 13 November. South Atlantic operations Aucilla completed her overhaul by 5 April 1968. On that day, she stood out of Norfolk on her way to refresher training in the West Indies. The oiler completed that mission in May and returned to Norfolk on the 19th. Soon thereafter, she embarked upon a two-month voyage that took her to the Cape of Good Hope where she refueled the Vietnam-bound aircraft carrier . In addition, Aucilla made port calls at Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, Nassau in the Bahamas, and at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before returning to Norfolk on 10 August. Last voyage and disposal At that time, the oiler began a tender availability as well as a leave and upkeep period preparatory to overseas movement. Aucilla stood out of Norfolk on 23 September; and, on 3 October she relieved at Rota. After almost five months fueling the ships of the 6th Fleet and making port visits throughout the Mediterranean, Aucilla departed Rota late in March 1969. She arrived back in Norfolk on 5 April. After the usual post-deployment standdown, the oiler began normal operations out of Norfolk. For the next 14 months, the ship cruised the waters along the eastern seaboard and the West Indies in support of the ships of the Atlantic Fleet. Aucilla returned to Norfolk from her last voyage early in July 1970. In the middle of September 1970, she began preparations for inactivation. Aucilla was placed out of commission at Norfolk on 18 December 1970 being commanded by the senior ranking official on board at the time MMCM William F. Rember of FMAG (Fleet Maintenance Assistance Group). On 7 October 1971, she was transferred to the Maritime Administration for berthing with its James River, Virginia, facility. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 December 1976. She was subsequently withdrawn from MARAD twice for further stripping, and last returned to MARAD on 21 August 1985. Sold on 27 April 1992, she was scrapped on 25 October 1992.PMARS Ship Record Detail - AUCILLA (AO-56) Military awards and honors Aucilla earned five battle stars for her World War II service.

Over millions of years, the Pacific Plate has moved over the Bowie hotspot, creating the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain in the Gulf of Alaska The Bowie hotspot is a volcanic hotspot, located west of the Queen Charlotte Islands in the Pacific Ocean. Almost all magma created by the hotspot has the composition of basalt, and so the volcanoes are constructed almost entirely of this igneous rock. The eruptions from the Bowie hotspot are effusive eruptions because basaltic magma is relatively fluid compared with magmas typically involved in more explosive eruptions, such as the andesitic magmas that produce some of the spectacular and dangerous eruptions around the margins of the Pacific Ocean. Bowie hotspot is believed to be perhaps wide and underlain by a mantle plume that is relatively deep. It is also considerably weak. Eruptions from the Bowie hotspot have left a trail of underwater mountains across the Pacific, called the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain, which is an underwater mountain region of seamounts along a line beneath the northern Pacific Ocean. The oldest volcano in the chain is Kodiak Seamount with an estimated age of 24 million years and the youngest called Bowie Seamount. Geological studies show that the base of Bowie Seamount formed less than a million years ago. The summit of Bowie Seamount is even younger and shows signs of having been active as recently as 18,000 years ago.

Its advantageous geographic location on the southern tip of Vancouver Island, by the Strait of Juan de Fuca, close to major population centres Vancouver and Seattle, has made it an attractive cruise ship destination. It also serves as a ship repair and supply facility for cruise ships and other vessels such as deep sea cable laying ships. Ogden Point also has a heliport with frequent service to Vancouver Harbour, Vancouver International Airport, and Seattle. The port lies at the eastern entrance of Victoria Harbour. For smaller boats there is boat ramp for trailerable boats. The cruise ship facility is the busiest port of call in Canada and is scheduled to handle 245 ship visits in 2018, with more than twenty ships carrying up to 3,000 passengers each from ten cruise lines expected to call between late April and early October. Most visits are single day or evening visits from liners cruising to Alaska from Seattle, Los Angeles, or San Francisco, but there are also cruises of the Pacific Northwest, often including Vancouver and/or Seattle. A pilot boat sets out from Ogden Point to bring a harbour pilot to a large vessel at the Brotchie Pilot Boarding Station The MV Tern carrying the submarine to Ogden Point, 30 April 2009  History  Ogden Point was named after Peter Skene Ogden (1790–1854), who was a prominent trader and explorer for the Hudson's Bay Company. The piers at Ogden Point were built in the early 20th century by the city of Victoria in anticipation of a growth in shipping due to the opening of the Panama Canal. In 1916 the US Hydrographic Office published a Coast Pilots guide that referred to the piers as the \\"Ocean Docks\\". That edition of Coast Pilots also mentioned that the breakwater south of Pier A was under construction in 1915. The breakwater was completed in 1916 and the piers were completed in 1918. Later in the century Victoria Machinery Depot built some of the first vessels for BC Ferries and other customers in the 1960s using Ogden Point for the larger ships. In 2001 the Norwegian Sky arrived from Seattle, becoming the first weekly cruise vessel to call on Ogden Point. In 2008, Ogden Point saw the arrival of 202 cruise ships and in excess of 380,000 passengers. The cruise ship terminal is considered an in transit port as presently no ships are home ported (embarked or disembarked) at this facility. In 2008 the facility was extensively rebranded in the Greater Victoria Harbour Authority's red, grey and black colour scheme. In 2009 Ogden Point saw the arrival of 228 cruise ships from a variety of cruise lines including Princess Cruises, Holland America Line, Celebrity Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line, Crystal Cruises as well as ResidenSea. These calls brought over 400,000 visitors to the city of Victoria between April 23 and October 14, 2009.Greater Victoria Harbour Authority  Facilities  The port facility has two finger piers designated Pier A (to the south) and Pier B (to the north). Berths on each pier are designated North and South. South A extends for , North A extends for . Pier B berths were extended to by installing a mooring dolphin in 2009. Each berth can accommodate a vessel with a draft in excess of at low tide. Although there are four berths, a maximum of three ships can be accommodated in port at any one time due to the close proximity of North A and South B. Canada Border Services Agency facilities are located at each pier. Pier A also houses a warehouse, complete with cable ship spooling apparatus and cable storage facility. Ogden Point has break bulk cargo docks. Vessels up to can be accommodated. Cruise ships calling at Ogden Point's Cruise Ship Terminal usually provide shore excursions for passengers and this may include tours of the Butchart Gardens, city tours, visits to Craigdarroch Castle, pub tours, Empress Hotel afternoon tea, whale watching, Chinatown, Victoria, horse-drawn trolley tours, and many other venues. During the cruise season, services to guests include a shuttle bus service operated by Wilson's Transportation to provide guests an alternative to the 30-minute walk to downtown Victoria. Public buses (#30/31) stop along Dallas Street on their way to downtown Victoria. Taxi cabs and limousines are also available onsite. Western Stevedoring is under contract from the Greater Victoria Harbour Authority to manage the facility and Cruise Terminal. The Camel Point heliport, , is operated by Pacific Heliport Services and is located just northeast of Pier B. For smaller boats there is boat ramp operated by the James Bay Anglers and is open to the public for use. Ogden Point has world-renowned cold water diving for any level of divers. Giant Pacific Octopus, Wolf Eels, Kelp, Sea Anemones, Nudibranchs and multiple fish and crustacean species can be found even at the shallowest depths. Multiple groups of reef balls have also been placed in 2008 to study the migration of species from the break-wall outwards. Due to currents and other hazards found in any diving environment a discover local diving tour with a dive professional is advised.

He was an influential theological writer during the reigns of King Charles I and, after the Restoration, King Charles II. His work would be considered important in the 19th century by key members of the Oxford Movement. Life He was the third son of Francis Thorndike, a Lincolnshire gentleman of good family, and Alice, his wife, daughter of Edward Colman, of a family resident at Burnt Ely Hale, and at Waldingfield One or other of the sister villages of Great Waldingfield and Little Waldingfield. in Suffolk. On 18 December 1613 he entered as a pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge, and was elected a scholar the following Easter. In January 1617 he proceeded B.A., in 1618 was elected a minor fellow, and in 1620 (on his admission to the degree of M.A.) a major fellow of the college. He was a committed scholar, also active as a college tutor, deputy public orator, and university preacher, and occasionally resided on his college living. His studies were on theology and oriental languages, and especially rabbinical literature. As a churchman, he was a moderate. On 13 April 1636 he was installed by Bishop John Williams prebendary of Layton Ecclesia in Lincoln Cathedral, just vacated by the death of his friend George Herbert. In 1640 he resigned his stall on his preferment to the crown living of Claybrook, near Lutterworth. In October 1640 he was appointed Hebrew lecturer to his college, and in June 1642 was transferred from Claybrook to the living of Barley, Hertfordshire (also pro hac vice in the gift of the crown); while at Trinity he received, about the same time, the additional appointment of senior bursar. In 1641 he published at the University Press his first tractate, Of the Government of Churches: a Discourse pointing at the Primitive Form, and in the following year Of Religious Assemblies, and the Publick Service of God. In September 1643, the mastership of Sidney Sussex College having fallen vacant, his friend Seth Ward who was a fellow of there, in conjunction with a majority of the other fellows, sought to carry Thorndike's election as Master; but Oliver Cromwell, who caused one of Thorndike's supporters to be arrested and taken away, managed the election of Richard Minshull. In 1644 the disfavour into which Trinity College had fallen with the parliamentary party compelled Thorndike to retire from his living of Barley, which was sequestered to Henry Prime, a parishioner; in 1647 one Peter Smith was appointed minister, on whose death (August 1657) Nathanael Ball succeeded. At nearly the same time a large number of the fellows of Trinity were ejected, and Thorndike deemed it prudent to withdraw from Cambridge. Until 1652 he had practical troubles, but was assisted by his college and by the liberality of John Scudamore, 1st Viscount Scudamore, whose religious views were close to his own. His elder brother Francis, who had succeeded to the paternal estate in 1644, probably gave him substantial aid. His Right of the Church in a Christian State (1649) was printed in London, and a new enlarged edition of his two tractates was printed by the University Press, connected with the prescribed use of the Directory of Public Worship. Thorndike took an active part in the editing of Brian Walton's Polyglott, the Syriac portion of which was his special contribution, and he carried on a correspondence with James Ussher, Walton, and Edward Pocock. From 1657 he collected materials for a new edition of Origen, a project which was not carried out in his lifetime (an edition appeared in Oxford in 1685). He worked on his major work (in Latin), the Epilogue, and the advocacy of its theory that the Protestant Reformation, as a durable settlement, was practicable only on the basis of a return to the discipline and teaching of the primitive catholic church. He did not include either the church of Rome or the Protestant churches abroad in his plan of reunion, his aim being chiefly to define the ground on which, as he held, the church of England could alone make good her own position. Clarendon and Isaac Barrow criticised certain portions of the Epilogue severely. With the Restoration, Thorndike was reinstated in his fellowship at Trinity and in his living of Barley (resigned in 1661). In July 1660 he published his Due Way of composing Differences, and on 20 March 1661 was appointed to assist at the Savoy Conference, where he took a minor part but suffered a barb from Richard Baxter. About the same time he was appointed a member of convocation, and in that capacity took a leading share in the revision of the prayerbook, then in progress; while in his tract entitled Just Weights and Measures (January 1662), designed to illustrate the practical application of the theory set forth in the Epilogue, he especially advocated as measures of church reform, the prevention of pluralities and the restoration of the discipline of penance. He fell ill, and moved back at the end of 1662 to Cambridge; he was absent during the plague of 1666. In June 1667 he again returned to Trinity, but his acceptance a few weeks later of the tithes of Trumpington parish involved the surrender of his fellowship, and he accordingly retired to his canonry at Westminster, where he took up residence in the cloisters. In 1668 his brother John Thorndike returned from his life of exile in New England, where he had helped to found Ipswich, Massachusetts, but only to die in the November of the same year. He was accompanied by his two daughters, Alice and Martha, who came to live with Herbert. The year 1670 saw the appearance of his Discourse of the Forbearance or Penalties which a due Reformation requires, and also of the first part of his De Ratione ac Jure finiendi Controversias Ecclesiae Disputatio, the restating the argument of the Epilogue and other works. In the spring of 1672 he was again ill, and he went to a place rented by the chapter at Chiswick. He died there on 11 July 1672, at the age of seventy-four, and was interred in the east cloister of Westminster Abbey. His will gave the bulk of his property to church purposes, after making some provision for his two nieces and for his grandniece, Anne Alington. Works Thorndike's position as a theologian was unusual and some of his views were challenged from his own side of the debates, in particular by Isaac Barrow in his posthumous tract on The Unity of the Church, and by Henry More in his Antidote to Idolatry. He countenanced the practice of prayers for the dead; and by Cardinal Newman he was regarded as the only writer of any authority in the English church who held the true theory of the Eucharist.

Lebanon is an eastern Mediterranean country that is composed of mostly Muslims and Christians. The main two religions are Islam with 61.1% of the citizens (Sunni and Shia) and Christianity with 33.7% of the citizens (the Maronite Church, the Orthodox Church, the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, Protestantism, the Armenian Apostolic Church). The Druze are about 5.2% of the citizens. The country has the most religiously diverse society of all states within the Middle East, comprising 18 recognized religious sects. But outside of Lebanon, Lebanese people (including diaspora) are mostly Christians. It is also estimated that a large proportion of its population are refugees (1.5 million out of a bit over 6 million in 2017) which affects statistics. The refugees mostly Syrian or Palestinian are predominately Sunni but also includes Christians and Shia. Cites Statistics Lebanon for most Lebanon statistics Lebanon thus differs from other Middle East countries where Muslims are the overwhelming majority and more resembles Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania, both in Southeastern Europe, in having a diverse mix of Muslims and Christians that each make up approximately half the country's population. Christians were once a majority inside Lebanon and are still a majority in the diaspora of the nearly 14 million Lebanese people living outside of Lebanon. The president of the country is traditionally a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim, and the speaker of parliament a Shia Muslim. Population by religious affiliation No official census has been taken since 1932, reflecting the political sensitivity in Lebanon over confessional (i.e. religious) balance. As a result, the religious affiliation of the Lebanese population is very difficult to establish with certainty and various sources are used to get the possible estimate of the population by religious affiliation. The following are different sources that do not pretend to be fully representative of the religious affiliation of the people of Lebanon. A 2012 study conducted by Statistics Lebanon, a Beirut-based research firm, found that Lebanon's population is estimated to be 54% Muslim (27% Shia; 27% Sunni), 5.6% Druze, 40.4% Christian (21% Maronite, 8% Greek Orthodox, 5% Melkite, 6.4% other Christian denominations like Armenian Orthodox, Armenian Catholic, Syriac Catholic, Syriac Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Chaldean, Assyrian, Copt). The CIA World Factbook estimates (2018) the following (data do not include Lebanon's sizable Syrian and Palestinian refugee populations): Muslim 61.1% (30.6% Sunni, 30.5% Shia, smaller percentages of Alawites and Ismailis), Christian 33.7% (Maronite Catholics are the largest Christian group), Druze 5.2%, and very small numbers of Jews, Baha'is, Buddhists, and Hindus. The International Foundation for Electoral Systems provides source for the registered voters in Lebanon for 2011 (it has to be noted that voter registration does not include people under 18 and unregistered voters) that puts the numbers as following: Sunni Islam 27.65%, Shia Islam 27.35%, Maronite Catholic 21.71%, Greek Orthodox 7.34%, Druze 5.74%, Melkite Catholic 4.76%, Armenian Apostolic 2.64%, other Christian Minorities 1.28%, Alawite Shia Islam 0.88%, Armenian Catholic 0.62%, Evangelical Protestant 0.53%, and other 0.18% of the population. There is also a very small and ancient community of Zoroastrians numbering between 100-500 individuals. Lebanon also has a Jewish population, estimated at less than 100. Demographics=Geographical distribution of sects in Lebanon=Lebanese Muslims Lebanese Muslims are divided into many sects like Sunnis, Shias, Druze, Alawites, and Ismailis. Lebanese Sunnis are mainly residents of the major cities: west Beirut, Tripoli, and Sidon. Sunnis are also present in rural areas including Akkar, Ikleem al Kharoub, and the western Beqaa Valley. Lebanese Shias are concentrated in Southern Lebanon, Baalbek District, Hermel District and the south Beirut (southern parts of Greater Beirut). Lebanese Druze Lebanese Druze are concentrated south of Mount Lebanon, in the Hasbaya District and Chouf District. Under the Lebanese political division (Parliament of Lebanon Seat Allocation) the Druze community is designated as one of the five Lebanese Muslim communities (Sunni, Shia, Druze, Alawi, and Ismaili), despite the Druze and Muslims having very different beliefs. The Druze make the majority in cities like Aley, Choueifat, Rashaya, Ras el-Matn, and Khaldeh, while the rest of the city population is made up with different Christian sects. Druze make up a slight majority in the Aley District, but are part of a smaller plurality in the Chouf District, Hasbaya District and the Rashaya District. The Druze tend to be located in and nearby to where the Christian communities are located, but they are often neighbors to Sunni towns nearby. Lebanese Christians Lebanese Christians are divided into many groups, several types of Catholics for instance the Maronites and Greek Catholics (Melkites), Greek Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox (among which are Syriacs, Armenians and Copts), Church of the East (Assyrians) and Protestants. Lebanese Maronites are concentrated in the north Beirut (northern parts of Greater Beirut), northern part of Mount Lebanon Governorate, southern part of North Governorate, parts of Beqaa Governorate and South Governorate.Lebanon Maronites Overview World Directory of Minorities. June 2008. Retrieved 28 December 2013. Greek Catholics are found everywhere but in particular in districts on the eastern slopes of the Lebanese mountain range and in Zahle where they are a majority. Lebanese Orthodox are concentrated in the north Beirut (northern parts of Greater Beirut), Lebanese North areas including Zgharta, Bsharre, Koura, and Batroun. Lebanese Protestants are concentrated mainly within the area of Beirut and Greater Beirut. The other Lebanese Christians are concentrated also in similar areas like in east Beirut (northern parts of Greater Beirut), Mount Lebanon, Zahlé, and Jezzine. Lebanese Jews As of 2018, the Jews in Lebanon make up the smallest religious group, with merely 0.08% of the population. Current political and religious issues Under the terms of an agreement known as the National Pact between the various political and religious leaders of Lebanon, the president of the country must be a Maronite, the Prime Minister must be a Sunni, and the Speaker of Parliament must be a Shia. Although Lebanon is a non-secular country, family matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance are still handled by the religious authorities representing a person's faith. Calls for civil marriage are unanimously rejected by the religious authorities but civil marriages conducted in another country are recognized by Lebanese civil authorities. Non-religion is not recognized by the state. However, in 2009, the Minister of the Interior Ziad Baroud made it possible to have a citizen's religious sect removed from his identity card.Religious Affiliation Can Be Removed From Lebanese ID Cards.

Laïque Pride supports the enacting of a unified Civil Code for the Personal Status Law. On April 26, 2010, in response to Hizb ut-Tahrir's growing appeal in Beirut and demands to re-establish an Islamic caliphate, a Laïque Pride march was held in Beirut. Three days later, 70,000 gathered in Martyrs' Square, Beirut for a march organized by Laïque Pride. In 2011, hundreds of protesters rallied in Beirut on 27 February in a Laïque Pride march, calling for reform of the country's confessional political system. At the same time, a peaceful sit-in took place in Saida. At a march in May 2012 in which 600 participated, Laïque Pride issued six demands, four concerning women's rights and two concerning media freedom. Secular student clubs from Saint Joseph University (USJ), the Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts (ALBA), as the American University of Beirut (AUB) also participated in the march. In October 2019, and until August 2020, a series of civil protests ensued in Lebanon, now known as the October Revolution condemning sectarian rule amongst a myriad of other issues plaguing their country.

He was born in Port-de-Paix, Saint-Domingue on the island of Hispaniola, on the plantation of Laveaux/Lapointe. His name was a transformation of the name cappouet, owner of the plantation. Military career His military career began in 1793 after a visit with independence leader Toussaint Louverture at Port-de-Paix. Then under the colonel Jacques Maurepas he was a member of the 9th brigade. His rank in the army changed quickly, first to Lieutenant, then to Captain of the 3rd Battalion. He participated under general Jacques Maurepas against all expeditions and invasions in the north-eastern region of the island. Capois is mostly known for his extraordinary courage and especially his herculean bravery at the Battle of Vertières in which the French general Viscount of Rochambeau, commander of Napoleon's army in Saint-Domingue (colonial Haiti), even called a brief cease-fire to congratulate him.  Capturing of Port-de-Paix and Tortuga Island After receiving new troops from France, Rochambeau dispatched General Clauzel against Port-de-Paix which Capois was forced to evacuate, but the fearless black general redeemed his defeat by storming the Petit-Fort where he captured the ammunition, of which he was in great need. After his success at Petit-Fort, he decided to attack Tortuga island (Île de la Tortue). The most difficult problem he had in this attack was how to reach this island without ships. He made up for this lack by building a raft consisting merely of planks held together by lianas. On the night of February 18, 1803, 150 soldiers under the command of Vincent Louis were huddled together on this frail means of transportation in tow of 2 rowboats. They fell unexpectedly on the garrison of Tortuga and for a while seemed to be the conquerors. But the French, who soon got over their surprise, rallied and defeated Vincent Louis, who succeeded in making his escape with some of his companions. The unfortunate blacks who were taken prisoner by the French were tortured to death in expiation of the audacious attempt. The failure did not discourage the energy of Capois. On April 12, 1803, Capois stormed Port-de- Paix, and soon after, Vincent Louis on his raft was again on his way to Tortuga. He succeeded this time in taking possession of the island, which the French never recovered. Battle of Vertières On November 18, 1803, Jean- Jacques Dessalines had ordered Capois to take Vertières, a fort situated upon a mount. Capois-la-Mort advanced with a demi-brigade which, horribly mutilated, soon recoiled before the cannon fire coming from the fort. He led it back for a second time, but was again driven to the bottom of the hill by the mitrailleuse. Boiling with rage, Capois ran to seek other new troops and, mounting his horse, advanced for the third time; again the thousand deaths that vomited from the fortress repulsed him and his brigade. Now for the fourth time, he asked his men to follow him by saying \\"Forward! forward!\\". While he was at the head of his men, his horse was hit by a cannonball—he fell, but Capois took his sword, got up, and ran to place himself again at the head of his black soldiers by shouting \\"Forward! Forward!\\" His cap, garnished with plumes, was carried away by a shot. He replied to the insult which left him hatless by drawing his sword and again throwing himself into the assault. Observing this, Rochambeau and his men shouted: \\"Bravo! bravo! bravo!\\" The firing in the fort ceased. Suddenly, the battle was still. A French staff officer mounted his horse and rode toward the intrepid Capois-la-Mort. With a great voice he shouted: \\"General Rochambeau sends compliments to the general who has just covered himself with such glory!\\" Then he saluted the Haitian warriors, returned to his position and the fight resumed. The next morning, a French officer followed by his companions led to the headquarters of the Haitian army a horse caparisoned, and delivered him with these words: \\"The Captain-general (Rochambeau) offers this horse as a mark of admiration to the \\"black Achilles\\" to replace the one of his that the French army regrets having killed.\\" Death On October 8, 1806, Capois was on his way to Cap-Haïtien when, near Limonade, he rode into a trap set for him, and was killed by assassins on the orders of Henri Christophe.

Division), also known as the 1st Division No. 23 (1. Division Nr. 23) was a unit of the Saxon and then Imperial German Army.From 1867, the Saxon Army was integrated into the Prussian Army's organizational structure (hence the dual numbering) in what was effectively the German Army. During the period of German unification (1866-1871), Saxony, along with the other states of the German Empire, entered into conventions with Prussia regarding their armies and only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous. The division was headquartered in Dresden.Günter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815-1939. (Biblio Verlag, Osnabrück, 1993), Bd. 1, p.120; Claus von Bredow, bearb., Historische Rang- und Stammliste des deuschen Heeres (1905), p.1386. The division was subordinated in peacetime to the XII (1st Royal Saxon) Army Corps (XII. (1. Königlich Sächsisches) Armeekorps).Bredow, p. 1385. The 1st Division No. 23 was officially formed on April 1, 1867. However, this was as part of the convention which integrated the division with the Prussian-led army of the North German Confederation. The division already existed as part of the autonomous Saxon Army. It was originally formed in 1849 as the 1st Division and from July 1, 1850, the 1st Infantry Division.Wegner, p. 738. It became the 1st Infantry Division No. 23 on April 1, 1867, and the 1st Division No. 23 on April 1, 1887.Bredow, p.1386 On mobilization for World War I in August 1914 it again became the 1st Infantry Division No. 23, although it was for convenience referred to outside Saxony as the 23rd Infantry Division or the 23rd (1st Royal Saxon) Infantry Division. The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division was recruited in eastern Saxony, especially around Dresden. Combat chronicle Saxony fought as an ally of Austria in the Austro-Prussian War. The Saxon Army Corps, including the 1st and 2nd Saxon Divisions, fought in several of the war's battles, including the decisive Battle of Königgrätz. In the Franco-Prussian War, Saxony was allied with Prussia. The 23rd Infantry Division fought in the battles of Gravelotte and Beaumont, and in the major Battle of Sedan. It then participated in the Siege of Paris.Hermann Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle unserer alten Armee (Berlin, 1935); Wegner, p.1386. During World War I, the division fought on the Western Front, seeing action in the Allied Great Retreat which culminated in the First Battle of the Marne. In 1916, it fought in the Battle of the Somme. In 1918, it participated in the German Spring Offensive, including the Second Battle of the Somme and the Second Battle of the Marne. The division was rated as very good in 1917, but third class by 1918; however, Allied intelligence noted that \\"its use... would seem to warrant a higher rating.\\"23\\\\.

The Cobb hotspot is a marine volcanic hotspot at (46˚ N, 130˚ W), which is 460 km (290 mi) west of Oregon and Washington, North America, in the Pacific Ocean. Over geologic time, the Earth's surface has migrated with respect to the hotspot through plate tectonics, creating the Cobb-Eicklberg seamount chain. The hotspot is currently collocated with the Juan de Fuca Ridge.  Cobb Seamount chain  The Cobb hotspot has created an underwater mountain range that extends to the northwest and ends at the Aleutian Trench. The oldest mount in the chain is the Marchland Seamount, at 30 to 43 Ma (million years old). The old, northwestern end of the chain collides with a subduction zone; therefore, the true age of the hotspot is difficult to determine as the oceanic crust is being consumed. Axial Seamount is the hotspot's most recent eruptive center, which last erupted in 2015, 2011 and 1998. The central ridge of the hotspot is thicker than the surrounding crust by a few kilometers and may be accumulated buildup from the magma released at the hotspot, which is essentially a submarine volcano with a root in diameter, reaching a depth of beneath the volcano. The magma flows at a rate of . The caldera is below sea level.Michael West; William Menke; Maya Tolstoy (February 2003). \\"Focused magma supply at the intersection of the Cobb hotspot and Juan de Fuca ridge\\" (PDF). Retrieved 2008-11-19.Michael West; William Menke; Maya Tolstoy. Focused Melt supply at the Cobb Hotspot/ Juan de Fuca Plate (PDF).  Geochemistry  Hotspots are formed when magma from the lower mantle upwells to the crust of Earth and breaks through the surface crust, whether that be oceanic crust or continental. This movement of magma breaks through the upper mantle, or the lithosphere, and creates a volcanic spot. This does not mean that all volcanoes are hotspots; some are created through interactions at plate boundaries. Tectonic plates move over hotspots creating a chain of volcanically-formed mountains over time. This is supported by the theory of plate tectonics. The peaks and mountains left behind are no longer active volcanoes. Hotspots do not necessarily occur on a plate boundary, though the Cobb Hotspot does.  Comparisons with mid-ocean ridge basalts  The magmas from the spreading ridge and the hotspot have differences. For one, they contain dissimilar concentrations of elements like Na2O, CaO and Sr at a given mafic level. This difference highlights that the magmas were formed at different depths in the mantle. It is theorized that the hotspot magma was melted deeper than that of the ridge. For these two masses of magma to exist, the temperature of the magma at the Cobb Hotspot must be of a particularly high temperature. It is undetermined whether the hotspot was created from mantle-core boundary convection, as the end of the chain is subducting under another. The initial plume of magma would leave behind geologic evidence at the surface, but due to the consumption of the older end of the chain this evidence isn't visible.  Variations along the chain  Trace elements were used to discover that older mounts created by the Cobb Hotspot contained more minerals like olivine and augite; both mafic minerals. Younger mounts created by the hotspot contain more minerals like calcic plagioclase, augite and pigeonite; they contain little to no olivine. These characteristics found at the younger mounts are like those found in basalts recovered from the Juan de Fuca Ridge. It is inferred that much of the difference in basalt composition along the chain is due to the time-dependent distance between hotspot and ridge. Oceanic crust thickens with distance from the mid-ocean ridge at which it originated. Therefore, as the Pacific plate migrated, the magma from the Cobb hotspot interacted with different thicknesses of crust. A thicker ocean crust would result in more differentiated basalt, while thinner crusts, like those at the current hotspot location, create less differentiated magma.  Interaction of the Cobb hotspot and the Juan de Fuca Ridge  The magma supply to the Cobb hotspot is more primitive than that of the Juan de Fuca Ridge magma. As the archaic magma flows beneath the magma chamber of the ridge, it causes further melting and rapid cooling, which allows for fractional crystallization.

The Management & Education Center at The Enchanted Forest Sanctuary in Titusville, is the EEL Program's first regional educational facility. The EEL Program was established in 1990 to protect the natural habitats of Brevard County by acquiring environmentally sensitive lands for conservation, passive recreation, and environmental education. This was made possible by citizens who voted to tax themselves up to $55 million for the acquisition and maintenance of Brevard's natural areas. Residents reaffirmed the EEL Program in 2004 under a second referendum to protect the natural habitats within Brevard County by the acquisition of environmentally sensitive lands through a willing seller program for the purpose of conservation, passive recreation, and environmental education. To maximize the funding, the EEL Program forms partnerships with federal, state and local agencies that are committed to the protection of natural resources and our long-term quality of life. EEL sanctuaries are managed to preserve native habitats and the plants and animals that live there. As of 2010, there have been purchased under the EEL program.

Water quality Brevard County has of waterline, presenting a challenge to water environmental management. In 2013, there were four major problems with water quality in the Indian River Lagoon. 1) Excess nitrogen and phosphorus from runoff from the application of fertilizer; 2) an estimated 8 to 11% septic tank failure. There are tens of thousands of septic tanks in the county. 3) Muck from construction, farming, erosion and dead plants, all find their way to the bottom of the lagoon, preventing growth and consuming vital oxygen essential to marine flora and fauna; 4) Invasive species, including the Asian green mussel, South American charru mussel, and the Australian spotted jellyfish, all eat clams and fish larvae. In 2017, excessive rain from storms, forced the county to discharge of untreated sewage into the Indian River Lagoon near Indian Harbour Beach. The law permits the dumping of treated wastewater. Dumping untreated sewage is a health-hazard. It contributes .5% of the nutrients in the lagoon. The county signed a consent order in 2018, that required the county, among other things, to install of force mains on the South Beaches from Florida State Road 518 south, at a cost of $10 million. In December 2005, four communities including Cocoa Beach, failed the salinity test in the adjacent Indian River Lagoon. The salinity was too low due to excessive fresh water runoff, a frequent problem in the area. Each community must address this problem. In 2010, the St. Johns River Water Management District was diverting the fresh water (and sediment and pollution) from the C-1 and C-54 canals into the Saint Johns instead of the lagoon.

They are seeking a federal designation of a \\"National Marine Sanctuary.\\" They are opposed by area fishermen. In 2008, Florida passed the Clean Oceans Act with support from local legislators. The intention was to force gambling ships out of Port Canaveral to dump sewage more than from shore. This took effect in 2009. During that year the gambling ships went bankrupt. This was believed due to the economy and other business reasons and not because of this statute. The water quality near shore, which was rarely below standard, did not change. Marine life Sea turtles nest on Brevard shores. They are sensitive to night lights which have affected their reproduction locally. The not-for- profit Sea Turtle Preservation Society (STPS) educates the public about marine turtles. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service permits STPS to work with these endangered and threatened sea turtles.STPS - Sea Turtle Preservation Society The Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge contains a twenty-mile (32 km) section of coastline from Melbourne Beach south. This is the most important nesting area for loggerhead sea turtles in the western hemisphere and the second most important nesting beach in the world.Caribbean Conservation & Sea Turtle Survival League :: CCC's Sea Turtle Survival League Programs & Projects Twenty-five percent of all loggerhead sea turtle and 35% of all green sea turtle nests in the United States occur in this twenty mile (32 km) zone. The Marine Resources Council focuses on issues affecting the Indian River Lagoon through its programs on shoreline restoration, water quality monitoring and right whale watching. It is possible to watch right whales from December through March as they migrate to their summer home in the South Atlantic.Brevard Zoo  A recent inventory disclosed a growing incidence of diseases, including cancers, lesions and tumors in dolphins, turtles and fish. Most recently, some shrimp and blue crab populations have been infected with a flesh-eating parasite, and scientists warn health problems may one day arise in people who use the estuary as well. The increasing appearance of invasive species—such as an Asian green mussel recently found—which can beat out other species for space in the lagoon and erode native diversity. Shrinkage has been documented in the lagoon's rich biodiversity and degradation of its water quality from crystal clear to murky green, which threaten its fisheries and Brevard's tourism industries. The Space Coast Chapter of the Coastal Conservation Association (SCCCCA) is to advise and educate the public on conservation of marine resources. It is primarily interested in conserving fisheries for sportsman.CCA Florida Space Coast Chapter There has been concern over the pace of manatee perinatal deaths in 2009. This pace may adversely affect attempts to preserve the species. Bottlenose dolphins have become stranded in the Indian River Lagoon usually resulting in their deaths. The highest number of annual deaths in the lagoon which covers another country besides Brevard, was 62 in 2008. The percentage found in the Brevard portion is about 80%. Beaches The Port Canaveral entry along with two jetties, block the normal drift of sand from north to south, robbing the beaches south for , of sand replenishment. Hundreds of millions of dollars will be spent replenishing these beaches from offshore sand, where allowed, and by dump trucks, when not allowed. 60% of this will be paid by the federal government, the remainder by county and local government. Lawmakers have purchased access to the ocean and beaches. Developers and owners were anticipated and not allowed to \\"wall off\\" ocean beach access as they have done elsewhere. The City of Satellite Beach has permanently preserved 37% of its oceanfront in its natural state (prevented it from being developed). 2005 - For the third year in a row, five of Brevard County's beaches were picked as some of the nation's cleanest, according to the (National) Clean Beaches Council. Brevard's beaches that made the list are Alan Shepard Park in Cocoa Beach, Cherie Down Park in Cape Canaveral, Ocean Avenue Beach Park, Spessard Holland Park in Melbourne Beach and The Boardwalk in Indialantic. The mission of Keep Brevard Beautiful (KBB) is to motivate and educate business, school, group and individual partnerships to reduce litter, recycle, landscape, and beautify for the environmental and economic benefit of Brevard County. Among other tasks, KBB schedules and oversees volunteer cleanups four times a year along roads, parks and beaches. Keep Brevard Beautiful Nearby is the Canaveral National Seashore park, a twenty-four mile stretch of undisturbed ocean beach near the Kennedy Space Center. Visitors take self-guided tours assisted by information from park rangers. Travelocity.com named this park among the top ten Florida beaches as well as among the top ten Family Attractions in Florida. The Mid-Reach Shore Protection Project has been the subject of considerable controversy The ‘mid- reach’ is home to a natural reef which runs along the beach from Patrick AFB down to Indialantic. In the past contractors have rebuilt the dunes after storms, however this larger Army Corps project proposes to bury the natural reef and replace it with a reef offshore. Studies have shown mitigation reefs do not adequately perform the ecological function of natural ones, and a group called ‘Save The Mid-Reach’ has organized locally to redesign the project and require better material standards for nourishment sand. The project will spend up to 500 million dollars on sand that is designed to wash away. Marine pests Authorities monitor water quality to try to free the waterways from floral pests such as the water hyacinth and hydrilla. Threats to potable water In 2010, there were 393 contaminated fuel tanks needing cleanup. 457 potable wells were within of these tanks, and therefore posing a potential health threat to those consuming water from them. An oncologist raised in the South Beaches developed cancer. She requested that water samples be measured in the area. In 2018 potable water distributed by the city of Melbourne measured up to 12 parts per trillion of PFBA (perfluorobutanoic acid). The EPA has established no standards for allowable levels of PFBA for drinking water. Minnesota has established a guideline of 7,000 parts per trillion. The measurements were well below this level. Critics thought that Minnesota standards were too low. There was no explanation of why the substance was in the water. Potable water furnished by the Cocoa water department found none of the contaminants. A cancer cluster of 175 cases including 50 people under 40 were reported on social media in a Satellite Beach Facebook group called Satellite Beach Health and Hope for Tomorrow. Cancer clusters have been found before in the area. Erin Brockovich agreed to visit the area in October to help cancer victims with their claim of water pollution. A spokesperson for Satellite Beach said the area under discussion was not in the city, but in an unincorporated area in the county. A similar complaint in 1992, was investigated by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. They found that there was no public health hazard and overall cancer rates were lower in Satellite Beach and the surrounding area than they were statewide. Breast and cervical cancer rates were higher. Threats to groundwater Two substances of concern, PFOS (Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) and PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) were found in beachside groundwater. Human epidemiological studies found associations between PFOS exposure and high cholesterol and adverse reproductive and developmental effects. Up to 430.1 parts per trillion have been measured in well water (nonpotable) in Cocoa Beach. Commentators suggested that Patrick Air Force Base used to employ firefighting foams that included these substances. They have since been phased out. Insect pests Mosquitoes can carry malaria, yellow fever, and equine encephalitis. The bites of yellow flies can sting people and domestic animals. The county conducts spraying for these pests, spraying at night to minimize the possibility of contaminating people or killing benign insects such as bees, which are active during the day. Each municipality must authorize the county to overfly its area to spray for mosquitoes. An invasion of white fly originally from Belize attacked palms and other ornamental plants for the first time in 2012. Wild hogs Wild hogs have become a nuisance in some suburbs. Alien species Species, alien to the area, have been discovered. They disrupt the environment and sometime interbreed with local species creating an unknowable species with unknown requirements or potential damage to the environment. *The african clawed frog was first discovered locally in 2011. *The false map turtle was discovered locally in 2009. *The red-footed tortoise was discovered in 2007. *Coyotes first entered the county in 2011.http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20110928/NEWS01/309270012/Coyotes- turn-up-Brevard-s-yards Air quality Despite its location by the ocean, air quality is not perfect.

Heilmann lacked a formal training in science although he studied medicine briefly before shifting to art. His ideas on bird evolution were first written in Danish in the Dansk Ornitologisk Tidsskrift. Heilmann received little help and often got considerable opposition from Danish professional zoologists of the time and he in turn often made dismissive remarks on the ideas of some of the established scientists of the time. The English edition however reached out to a much larger audience and influenced ideas in bird evolution for nearly half a century. Life Heilmann was born in Skelskør, Denmark where his father was a pharmacist. He joined a polytechnic at Roskilde in 1877 but moved to study medicine. While studying medicine he became inclined towards art and considered becoming a professional. Against the wishes of his family, he quit his medicine studies in 1883 and became an apprentice painter of Franz Schwartz and later P S Krøyer. He joined Royal Copenhagen porcelain works in 1890 and worked there until 1902. He then worked as a free-lance artist, illustrating books. Some of his key works included illustrations in Schiøler's Danmarks Fugle (birds of Denmark), Jægeren i Naturen (1925) (Hunter in Nature), Danmarks Sangfugle 1926 (Denmark's songbirds), and a three-volume Danmarks Fugleliv (1926–1930). An ardent birdwatcher himself, he was one of the first members of the Danish Ornithological Society started in 1906. He designed the front cover of the society's journal. Some Danish banknotes were designed by him. His major work was however published as a series of short notes in Danish published in the journal Dansk Ornitologisk Forenings Tidsskrift between 1913 and 1916 and titled Vor nuværende Viden om Fuglenes Afstamning (Our present knowledge about the origin of birds). In 1926, he enlarged this and published it as an English book \\"The Origin of Birds\\". This was acclaimed for its bold ideas, depth of research and excellent illustration. He was largely self-taught and essentially an amateur, he was largely disregarded locally by established academics. He however was not afraid of taking on the establishment and made his arguments clear. Heilmann was considered a quarrelsome personality. He was brought up in a conservative religious family. In later life he rebelled against religion and in 1940 he wrote a book on Darwinism and devoted the last section to arguing against religious ideas (Univers og traditionen). This included a large section pointing out how angels could not have wings since they did not have the right chest musculature. Except for this part of the book, it was overall well received. In 1942 he changed the spelling of his name to \\"Heilman\\", however the older spelling predominates. The Origin of Birds Heilmann's comparison between the skulls of Aetosaurus, Archaeopteryx and a pigeon Heilmann published an English revision of his series of Danish papers in 1926 as The Origin of Birds. Like Thomas Huxley, Heilmann compared Archaeopteryx and other birds to an exhaustive list of prehistoric reptiles, and also came to the conclusion that theropod dinosaurs like Compsognathus were the most similar. However, Heilmann noted that birds possessed clavicles fused to form a bone called the furcula ('wishbone'), and while clavicles were known in more primitive reptiles, they had not yet been recognized in theropod dinosaurs. A firm believer in Dollo's Law, which states that evolution is not reversible, Heilmann could not accept that clavicles were lost in dinosaurs and re-evolved in birds, so he was forced to rule out dinosaurs as bird ancestors and ascribe all of their similarities to convergence. Heilmann stated that bird ancestors would instead be found among the more primitive 'thecodont' grade of reptiles. Heilmann's extremely thorough approach ensured that his book became a classic in the field and its conclusions on bird origins, as with most other topics, were accepted by nearly all evolutionary biologists for the next four decades, despite the discovery of clavicles in the primitive theropod Segisaurus in 1936. Clavicles and even fully developed furculae have since been identified in numerous other non-avian dinosaurs. In 1912 he contacted Adolf Herluf Winge at the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen. Winge had initially shown some interest in his work but was not particularly helpful. Winge's short responses to an eight-page letter of queries and ideas caused much irritation and Heilmann decided to stop writing to him. Heilmann later noted that Winge was a Lamarckist, and from that point he worked alone without communication with Danish academics. He sent a short paper in Danish in 1912 and this was accepted by the editor Otto Helms. Helms was attacked by numerous Danish academics for allowing it to be published. A letter from the Danish zoologist R. H. Stamm to Helms read: May I offer my condolences as to the latest issue? It must have been rough on you – who must know birds well, and as a medical doctor must possess some general sense of natural history – to include in the journal the dilettantish mess which occupies most of the issue. His first paper published in the Danish ornithology journal was however discovered by American paleontologist R. W. Shufeldt, who was able to make sense of it thanks to help from his Norwegian wife. This opened up Heilmann to connections outside Denmark. His work was introduced to D'Arcy Thompson by R. W. Shufeldt and this led to the two exchanging ideas on morphological evolution. His past bitter encounters with Danish academics led to Heilmann initially writing \\"I wonder why Dr. R.W. Shufeldt has written to you about my work; he ought to have told you, that I am an artist and only an incipient amateur in science. This is my first work in this line.\\" In the course of his interactions with Thompson, he also contributed some illustrations for use in \\"On Growth and Form\\". In 1940, Heilmann published a second book on Darwinian evolution, the Univers og traditionen (Universe and Tradition, in Danish). He also expressed his sentiments against religious beliefs in this book. The bird-like dinosaur species Scansoriopteryx heilmanni was named in honour of Gerhard Heilmann in 2002.

Division), also known as the 2nd Division No. 24 (2. Division Nr. 24) was a unit of the Saxon and then Imperial German Army.From 1867, the Saxon Army was integrated into the Prussian Army's organizational structure (hence the dual numbering) in what was effectively the German Army. During the period of German unification (1866-1871), Saxony, along with the other states of the German Empire, entered into conventions with Prussia regarding their armies and only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous. The division was headquartered in Leipzig.Günter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815-1939. (Biblio Verlag, Osnabrück, 1993), Bd. 1, p.120; Claus von Bredow, bearb., Historische Rang- und Stammliste des deuschen Heeres (1905), p.1386. Until 1899, the division was subordinated in peacetime to the XII (1st Royal Saxon) Army Corps (XII. (1. Königlich Sächsisches) Armeekorps); thereafter, it was subordinated in peacetime to the XIX (2nd Royal Saxon) Army Corps (XIX. (2. Königlich Sächsisches) Armeekorps).Bredow, p. 1385, 1390. The 2nd Division No. 24 was officially formed on April 1, 1867. However, this was as part of the convention which integrated the division with the Prussian-led army of the North German Confederation. The division already existed as part of the autonomous Saxon Army. It was originally formed in 1849 as the 2nd Division and from July 1, 1850, the 2nd Infantry Division.Wegner, p. 738. It became the 2nd Infantry Division No. 24 on April 1, 1867, and the 2nd Division No. 24 on April 1, 1887.Bredow, p.1390 On mobilization for World War I in August 1914, it again became the 2nd Infantry Division No. 24, although it was for convenience referred to outside Saxony as the 24th Infantry Division or the 24th (2nd Royal Saxon) Infantry Division. The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division was recruited in western Saxony, especially around Leipzig. Combat chronicle Saxony fought as an ally of Austria in the Austro-Prussian War. The Saxon Army Corps, including the 1st and 2nd Saxon Divisions, fought in several of the war's battles, including the decisive Battle of Königgrätz. In the Franco-Prussian War, Saxony was allied with Prussia. The 24th Infantry Division fought in the battles of Gravelotte and Beaumont, and in the major Battle of Sedan. It then participated in the Siege of Paris.Hermann Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle unserer alten Armee (Berlin, 1935); Wegner, p.1390. During World War I, the division fought on the Western Front, seeing action in the Allied Great Retreat which culminated in the First Battle of the Marne, and then in the Race to the Sea. In 1916, it fought in the Battle of the Somme. In 1918, it participated in the German Spring Offensive, including the Second Battle of the Somme. Allied intelligence rated the division \\"very good\\" in 1917, but third class in 1918; however, its \\"conduct... was above average and would warrant a higher rating.\\"24\\\\.

NBE was first described for the simply typed lambda calculus. It has since been extended both to weaker type systems such as the untyped lambda calculus using a domain theoretic approach, and to richer type systems such as several variants of Martin-Löf type theory.  Outline  Consider the simply typed lambda calculus, where types τ can be basic types (α), function types (→), or products (×), given by the following Backus–Naur form grammar (→ associating to the right, as usual): :(Types) τ ::= α  τ1 → τ2  τ1 × τ2 These can be implemented as a datatype in the meta- language; for example, for Standard ML, we might use: datatype ty = Basic of string  Arrow of ty * ty  Prod of ty * ty Terms are defined at two levels. The lower syntactic level (sometimes called the dynamic level) is the representation that one intends to normalise. :(Syntax Terms) s,t,… ::= var x  lam (x, t)  app (s, t)  pair (s, t)  fst t  snd t Here lam/app (resp. pair/fst,snd) are the intro/elim forms for → (resp. ×), and x are variables. These terms are intended to be implemented as a first-order in the meta- language: datatype tm = var of string  lam of string * tm  app of tm * tm  pair of tm * tm  fst of tm  snd of tm The denotational semantics of (closed) terms in the meta-language interprets the constructs of the syntax in terms of features of the meta-language; thus, lam is interpreted as abstraction, app as application, etc. The semantic objects constructed are as follows: :(Semantic Terms) S,T,… ::= LAM (λx. S x)  PAIR (S, T)  SYN t Note that there are no variables or elimination forms in the semantics; they are represented simply as syntax. These semantic objects are represented by the following datatype: datatype sem = LAM of (sem -> sem)  PAIR of sem * sem  SYN of tm There are a pair of type-indexed functions that move back and forth between the syntactic and semantic layer. The first function, usually written ↑τ, reflects the term syntax into the semantics, while the second reifies the semantics as a syntactic term (written as ↓τ). Their definitions are mutually recursive as follows: > \\\\begin{align} \\\\uparrow_{\\\\alpha} t &= \\\\mathbf{SYN}\\\\ t \\\\ \\\\uparrow_{\\\\tau_1 > \\\\to \\\\tau_2} v &= \\\\mathbf{LAM} (\\\\lambda S.\\\\ \\\\uparrow_{\\\\tau_2} (\\\\mathbf{app}\\\\ > (v, \\\\downarrow^{\\\\tau_1} S))) \\\\ \\\\uparrow_{\\\\tau_1 \\\\times \\\\tau_2} v &= > \\\\mathbf{PAIR} (\\\\uparrow_{\\\\tau_1} (\\\\mathbf{fst}\\\\ v), \\\\uparrow_{\\\\tau_2} > (\\\\mathbf{snd}\\\\ v)) [1ex] \\\\downarrow^{\\\\alpha} (\\\\mathbf{SYN}\\\\ t) &= t \\\\ > \\\\downarrow^{\\\\tau_1 \\\\to \\\\tau_2} (\\\\mathbf{LAM}\\\\ S) &= \\\\mathbf{lam}\\\\ (x, > \\\\downarrow^{\\\\tau_2} (S\\\\ (\\\\uparrow_{\\\\tau_1} (\\\\mathbf{var}\\\\ x)))) \\\\text{ where > } x \\\\text{ is fresh} \\\\ \\\\downarrow^{\\\\tau_1 \\\\times \\\\tau_2} (\\\\mathbf{PAIR}\\\\ > (S, T)) &= \\\\mathbf{pair}\\\\ (\\\\downarrow^{\\\\tau_1} S, \\\\downarrow^{\\\\tau_2} T) > \\\\end{align} These definitions are easily implemented in the meta-language: (* reflect : ty -> tm -> sem *) fun reflect (Arrow (a, b)) t = LAM (fn S => reflect b (app t (reify a S)))  reflect (Prod (a, b)) t = PAIR (reflect a (fst t)) (reflect b (snd t))  reflect (Basic _) t = SYN t (* reify : ty -> sem -> tm *) and reify (Arrow (a, b)) (LAM S) = let x = fresh_var () in Lam (x, reify b (S (reflect a (var x)))) end  reify (Prod (a, b)) (PAIR S T) = Pair (reify a S, reify b T)  reify (Basic _) (SYN t) = t By induction on the structure of types, it follows that if the semantic object S denotes a well-typed term s of type τ, then reifying the object (i.e., ↓τ S) produces the β-normal η-long form of s. All that remains is, therefore, to construct the initial semantic interpretation S from a syntactic term s. This operation, written ∥s∥Γ, where Γ is a context of bindings, proceeds by induction solely on the term structure: > \\\\begin{align} \\\\ \\\\mathbf{var}\\\\ x \\\\_\\\\Gamma &= \\\\Gamma(x) \\\\ \\\\ \\\\mathbf{lam}\\\\ > (x, s) \\\\_\\\\Gamma &= \\\\mathbf{LAM}\\\\ (\\\\lambda S.\\\\ \\\\ s \\\\_{\\\\Gamma, x \\\\mapsto > S}) \\\\ \\\\ \\\\mathbf{app}\\\\ (s, t) \\\\_\\\\Gamma &= S\\\\ (\\\\t\\\\_\\\\Gamma) \\\\text{ where > } \\\\s\\\\_\\\\Gamma = \\\\mathbf{LAM}\\\\ S \\\\ \\\\ \\\\mathbf{pair}\\\\ (s, t) \\\\_\\\\Gamma &= > \\\\mathbf{PAIR}\\\\ (\\\\s\\\\_\\\\Gamma, \\\\t\\\\_\\\\Gamma) \\\\ \\\\ \\\\mathbf{fst}\\\\ s \\\\_\\\\Gamma > &= S \\\\text{ where } \\\\s\\\\_\\\\Gamma = \\\\mathbf{PAIR}\\\\ (S, T) \\\\ \\\\ > \\\\mathbf{snd}\\\\ t \\\\_\\\\Gamma &= T \\\\text{ where } \\\\t\\\\_\\\\Gamma = \\\\mathbf{PAIR}\\\\ > (S, T) \\\\end{align} In the implementation: (* meaning : ctx -> tm -> sem *) fun meaning G t = case t of var x => lookup G x  lam (x, s) => LAM (fn S => meaning (add G (x, S)) s)  app (s, t) => (case meaning G s of LAM S => S (meaning G t))  pair (s, t) => PAIR (meaning G s, meaning G t)  fst s => (case meaning G s of PAIR (S, T) => S)  snd t => (case meaning G t of PAIR (S, T) => T) Note that there are many non-exhaustive cases; however, if applied to a closed well- typed term, none of these missing cases are ever encountered. The NBE operation on closed terms is then: (* nbe : ty -> tm -> tm *) fun nbe a t = reify a (meaning empty t) As an example of its use, consider the syntactic term \`SKK\` defined below: val K = lam (\\"x\\", lam (\\"y\\", var \\"x\\")) val S = lam (\\"x\\", lam (\\"y\\", lam (\\"z\\", app (app (var \\"x\\", var \\"z\\"), app (var \\"y\\", var \\"z\\"))))) val SKK = app (app (S, K), K) This is the well-known encoding of the identity function in combinatory logic. Normalising it at an identity type produces: \\\\- nbe (Arrow (Basic \\"a\\", Basic \\"a\\")) SKK; val it = lam (\\"v0\\",var \\"v0\\") : tm The result is actually in η-long form, as can be easily seen by normalizing it at a different identity type: \\\\- nbe (Arrow (Arrow (Basic \\"a\\", Basic \\"b\\"), Arrow (Basic \\"a\\", Basic \\"b\\"))) SKK; val it = lam (\\"v1\\",lam (\\"v2\\",app (var \\"v1\\",var \\"v2\\"))) : tm  See also  * MINLOG, a proof assistant that uses NBE as its rewrite engine.

The newspaper is managed and printed by The MetroWest Daily News. Both are owned by Gannett.

The trust also ran daily newspapers in Biddeford, Maine, and Little Falls, New York, as well as the family's charities. To raise money for other obligations, the trust sold the papers in 1996 to CNC, then part of Fidelity Investments. CNC managers, upon their purchase of Alta, said they were most interested in the Milford property, which bordered the coverage area of two CNC dailies—the Middlesex News and the Dedham Transcript. Bill Elfers, CNC's CEO, called the Milford paper \\"an outstanding property\\"; it had made almost US$5 million in revenues the previous year, accounting for the largest part of Alta's US$1 million annual profit.\\"Community Spreads Out, But Are the New Papers Keepers?\\" NewsInc., December 9, 1996.

Early life Calvillo was born in 1763 in the Valley of Huejúcar in northern Nueva Galicia. The village of his birth later became part of the state of Aguascalientes and was renamed Calvillo, in his honor. He was educated at the Seminary of Guadalajara and ordained a priest by Bishop Don Juan Cruz Ruiz de Cabañas y Crespo in 1797. He served in a number of parishes in the archdiocese of Guadalajara, including Juchipila, Hacienda de San Jacinto, Ojocaliente, Tepechitlán and Colotlán, serving as pastor of the latter parish while inhabiting the town of Huejúcar. Military career For health reasons, he temporarily resided in the city of Aguascalientes, and in 1809, while residing in Jesus María, he learned of the uprising in Dolores Hidalgo and joined in the effort. He led a group of experienced indigenous archers in Colotlán with the help of the governor of the Tlaxcala neighborhood, Marcos Escobedo. In late September 1810, the group organized in his home in Colotlán and captured Spanish government buildings in the town and captured thirty Spaniards, who were sent to Zacatecasas prisoners. He eventually recruited an army of 5,000 indigenous archers from Colotlán and surrounding indigenous towns and was granted the title of Field Marshal by Miguel Hidalgo. Calvillo and his troops took part in the January 17, 1811 Battle of the Bridge of Calderón, where he lost a great portion of his troops. After the most prominent leaders of the insurgency began their retreat towards the U.S. border, Calvillo went on fighting in the Zacatecas region. The priest of Santa Cruz, Jose Francisco Alvarez, head of the royalist forces, was ordered to pursue Calvillo and the two priests' forces faced each other on March 27, 1811, in the vicinity of Colotlán. Calvillo was victorious, forcing Alvarez to withdraw troops to Jerez. Soon thereafter, Brigadier Pedro Celestino Negrete launched an attack on the Calvillo's home base of Colotlán on April 7, defeating the insurgents and taking control of the town. Calvillo and his allies organized an uprising in the town on May 11, 1811 and in August 1812 Calvillo led his troops along with those of García Ramos, Miramontes and Oropeza to take control of the cities of Hermosillo and Aguascalientes. This appears to have been the last military action of Calvillobefore he retreated into the wilderness in the Sierra de Tayahua, from where he continued to suffer ill health while attempting to obtain a pardon from civil and ecclesiastical authorities. He died in the city of Zacatecas, of natural causes and was restored to full communion with the Catholic Church on April 6, 1816. References *Weekly Journal of the Archdiocese of Guadalajara.

Childhood Born in Giengen, Germany, Margarete was the daughter of building contractor Friedrich Steiff and his wife Maria Margarete, née Haehnle. At eighteen months, Margarete contracted a high fever that left her legs paralyzed and right arm difficult to raise. After three years, doctors finally diagnosed her with polio. Alt URL Her parents were keen that she live a full life and investigated many medical treatments with little success. As a child she was taken to school in a small hand-pulled cart by her sisters and other neighborhood children. In her later reminiscences, she recalls 'All the children gathered around me and I organised games in which I was the center of attention. However, the older children often ran off and then I was left babysitting the tiny tots' Margarete regularly attended school throughout her childhood and in spite of the pain in her right hand, went to the needlework classes of Frau Schelling where she completed her training as a seamstress at the age of 17. She occasionally worked with her sisters, who had opened a women's tailors. She also became an accomplished zither player, teaching others to play to earn some money. Her savings allowed her to buy a sewing machine, the first owned in the town of Giengen, and this led to another opportunity to earn income. Margarete worked on trousseaus for the town folk and by her mid-twenties was making fashionable clothes and traveling to other towns to work and visit family, sending her cart ahead of her and traveling by post coach. Entrepreneurship In 1877 Margarete opened a felt store and began making felt underskirts, which had just become fashionable, for the firm of Christian Siegle in Stuttgart. She was soon able to employ people to work for her and it became a thriving business. 'At this time I came across a pattern for a toy elephant. Felt was the ideal material for this toy and the filling would be of the finest lambswool. Now I could make these as gifts for the children in the family and I tried out the patterns in various sizes'. In 1879, the American magazine Delineator published a pattern for a cloth mouse, rabbit and elephant, other animal patterns followed and the German magazine Modenwelt reproduced these patterns. Margarete made many of these toys and gave them as gifts to friends, and by 1880 she started to sell them in small numbers. In the following years she widened her range of small cloth animals based on the magazine patterns, but with small alternations to the cloth used and accessories. In 1892, her small company applied for a patent \\"for making of animals and other figures to serve as playthings\\". The patent number was DRP 66996, but this was later withdrawn when contested by another German toy manufacturer. Margarete's brother Fritz realised that there was an opportunity to sell large numbers of these toy animals and he took some samples to the market in Heidenheim, coming away with many orders. Production and turnover increased each year as did the variety of toys on offer. Pull-along and ride- on toys were also added with the development of metal frames inside the toys. By 1889, the company moved into a larger building, which had a corner shop where the toys and fabric could be displayed for sale. The words \\"Felt-Toy- Factory\\" were painted in large letters on the outside wall. Next came a printed catalogue for customers to order from, and the business grew. In 1897, Margarete Steiff's creative nephew, Richard Steiff, joined the company. He had previously studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule (Arts and Crafts Academy) in Stuttgart, Germany. His sketches became the basis for many different Steiff toys.\\"Firmenhistorie - Steiff Online-Shop Deutschland\\". 2019. Steiff.Com. Accessed April 2, 2019. https://www.steiff.com/de-de/fascination- steiff/history. First teddy bear Margarete Steiff made up all the samples of any new toys herself so she could uncover any problems that might arise in production. Between 1897 and 1899, the Steiff company was designing and making \\"dancing bear\\" toys. Rather than the familiar teddy bear, these were standing figures carrying sticks and with rings through their noses imitating the real- life dancing bears that traveled from town to town to provide entertainment at this time, or pull-along bears on wheels. In 1902, Richard Steiff designed \\"Bear 55 PB\\", the first soft toy with movable joints, which was to become the first teddy bear. By 1903, a large shipment of toys had been sent to a New York showroom, but there was not much interest in the plush toy bears that were displayed there. In March 1903, Richard Steiff took jointed soft toy bears to a spring fair in Leipzig, where they caught the eye of an American buyer, who ordered 3000 bears. From then on, \\"Bear 55 PB\\" became a bestseller in the United States - a remarkable achievement for a small German business from the Swabian Albs. Starting in 1906, the bear became known under the name \\"Teddy Bear\\", named after the American President Theodore \\"Teddy\\" Roosevelt.Brunner, Bernd, and Lori Lantz. \\"Bear Substitutes.\\" In Bears: A Brief History, 211-19.

Originally from a small town in southern Germany and living with a life-long physical disability, she founded and grew a business that continues to be recognized around the world. In the literature on German entrepreneurs, she is cited as an idol for female entrepreneurship and innovation, growing her business beyond German borders. The Steiff bear went on to become the most famous and sought-after brand of teddy bears. In 1910, Steiff won the Grand Prix at the world exhibition Brussels International 1910 in Belgium. Today, Steiff continues to be considered among the most high- quality toy manufactured in the world and older Steiff toys have become valuable collectibles.

It currently serves as a museum, archive and headquarters for the Historical Society of Newburgh Bay and The Highlands.  Description and history  David Crawford The mansion could be described as a conjunction of the Neoclassical, Greek Revival and late Federal-styles. It was built by David Crawford, who had made his fortune in Hudson River shipping in during the 1830s. Crawford was leased the land on March 8th, 1830, by the Trustees of the Glebe, for a period of 900 years. His family originated from Ulster, and immigrated to America in 1731, settling Little Britain alongside the Clinton family. The Crawfords moved to Newburgh in 1806 as David's father, Francis, saw a burgeoning market for agricultural products. With Eunice Watkins of Campbell Hall, he had four sons: David, Thomas, Samuel and James. The brothers and their mother succumbed to tuberculosis, and David ameliorated his health by accepting a job as a deputy sheriff in 1810. Frequent horseback- riding built up his immunity. As the War of 1812 broke out, Crawford enlisted in the army and formed a volunteer company which relocated to New York Harbor. He became attached to an artillery regiment and eventually promoted to captain. After spending time in the harbor, he gained an understanding of shipping and maritime trade, becoming interested in their economic benefits. In May 1822, David Crawford married Fanny C. Belknap, daughter of General Isaac Belknap. They had two daughters, Mary Elizabeth, called \\"Lib\\", and Anna. In 1825, he became involved in the building of a steamboat to freight goods from Newburgh to New York City. The steamer Baltimore, purchased during the winter of 1829—1830, began shipping from D. Crawford & Co.'s wharf that spring.  Architecture  352x352px pilasters, pediments and molding. The fireplaces are of black marble. The architect of the house remains unknown, but speculation hints that the Crawford House was not their only work in the area. William Roe, a retired grocer, had a mansion of very similar architectureHistoric American Buildings Survey, Creator. . New York Newburgh Orange County, 1933. Documentation Compiled After.

Newburgh, New York: E. M. Ruttenber & Son. pp. 390–391. Benjamin Carpenter, a merchant and factory owner, had a mansion on High Street. Even earlier, in 1800, a house with a similar floor plan was occupied by Samuel Williams and later Francis Gouldie. The house, later known as Clisophic Hall, was built for the Rev. Jonathan Freeman, who led the United Church. It became the Newburgh Home for the Friendless in 1861.Nutt, John J. (1891). Newburgh: Her Institutions, Industries and Leading Citizens. Newburgh, New York: Ritchie & Hull. p. 153 - 154. All four structures featured a large central hall that spanned the first floor, with double parlors on either side. A large doorway divided the hall, but only the Crawford House features a transom and sidelights. Only the Roe Mansion and Crawford House remain standing. Architrave trim of an elaborate design gives a flaunting impression, and carved laurel details in rectangles above the doors are seen consistently. The free-standing stairs have mahogany balustrades and elegant brackets. A most curious detail of the staircase is the iconic newel post, a carved dolphin head. It is thought to be the work of a Massachusetts ship figurehead carver. On the west end of the first floor, an alcove addition is now staged as a small library. The house's kitchen was in the basement, and now used by the Historical Society as a museum. Above the house's river-facing east entrance, a former sewing room also holds artifacts. The doors of the upstairs floor, and most on the main floor, are pine, painted with faux bois. Perhaps the house's most imposing element is its large pediment, centered with a Palladian window, supported by four 40' ionic columns.  Historical Society's Acquisition  On October 3rd, 1953, the house was scheduled for a public auction. Many feared the nearby funeral home would purchase and demolish it to make room for a parking lot. On September 28th, the Historical Society of Newburgh Bay & The Highlands decided to purchase the house. The Ossoli Club, Trustees of Washington's Headquarters and the Daughters of the American Revolution also contributed to the purchase as well as subsequent fundraising. Period furniture was donated for the interior, including a Duncan Phyfe sofa. Senator Thomas C. Desmond donated a period knocker. An inlaid white holly table was donated by Mary Roe Zeigler, wife of Lee Woodward Zeigler. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in on September 27, 1972, and became a contributing property when the Montgomery-Grand-Liberty Streets Historic District was established the following year. Today it is the headquarters of the society, which operates as a seasonal museum open to the public on Sundays and for special events. Its collection of historical artifacts, particularly boat prints and models, relate to Crawford's business in an exhibit on his life. The collection also features a Gothic chimney rescued from the demolished mansion of A. J. Downing. The Historical Society obtained a grant from the state in 2007 to repair the roof, chimneys, gutters, and facade. The house also received a top-to-bottom paint job.

It is a compendium of seven articles that previously appeared in journals on a variety of subjects. The book extends Axelrod's method of applying the results of game theory, in particular that derived from analysis of the Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) problem, to real world situations. Prisoner's Dilemma findings Axelrod explains the Tit for tat (TFT or T4T) strategy emerged as the most robust option in early IPD tournaments on computer. This strategy combines a willingness to cooperate with a determination to punish non-cooperation. In these articles, however, he shows, that under more complex circumstances, such as the possibility of error, strategies that are a little more cooperative or a little less punitive do even better than TFT. Generous TFT, or GTFT, cooperates a bit more often than TFT, while Contrite TFT or CTFT defects less frequently. Applications Axelrod applied various models related to IPD to a variety of situations, drawing conclusions from these simulations about the ways in which groups form, adhere, oppose or join other groups, and other topics in the fields of genetic evolution, business, political science, military alliances, wars, and more. He has added introductions to these articles explaining what real-world issues drove his research. Critical response Philosopher and political economist Francis Fukuyama, writing for the Foreign Affairs, praises the book for showing that realist models, which assume that in situations lacking a single sovereign actor that anarchy will necessarily result, are too simplistic. Fukuyuma, expresses concern, however, that the game theory approaches aren't sufficiently complex to model real international relations, because they assume a world with large numbers of simple actors. Fukuyama holds that, instead, the real world consists of a small number of highly complex actors, thus potentially limiting the applicability of Axelrod's analysis.

Discovered in 1833 by King Mongkut (Rama IV), it was eventually deciphered and dated to 1292. The text gives, among other things, a description of the Sukhothai Kingdom during the time of King Ram Khamhaeng, to whom it is usually attributed. The inscription had immense influence over the development of Thai historiography from the early 20th century, which came to regard Sukhothai as the first Thai kingdom. From the late 1980s to 1990s, assertions that the stele was a forgery from a later date led to intense scholarly debate, which has not been definitively settled, though the majority of academics today regard it as at least partly authentic. The inscription is widely regarded as the single most important document in Thai history, and was inscribed on the UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2003. Description and discovery The inscription was discovered near Noen Prasat, then believed to be the site of the old palace, now in Sukhothai Historical Park. The stele is in the shape of a four-sided pillar, mostly square and wide on each side, with a rounded pyramidal top. It is made of siltstone; the upper section which bears the inscriptions is polished, while the lower part, which probably fitted into a base, remains rough. It is in total height. The stele was discovered in 1833 by Prince Mongkut, who would later become King in 1851 and was at the time ordained as a monk. Mongkut had made a pilgrimage to the ancient town of Sukhothai, where among the ruins, then believed to be the site of the old palace, he discovered the stele, as well as a carved stone slab believed to be the throne of the Sukhothai ruler. He had his retinue bring the objects back to Bangkok, and they were placed in Wat Samo Rai (now named Wat Rachathiwat) where he was residing. The inscription followed Mongkut to Wat Bowonniwet in 1836, and was later moved to the Grand Palace's Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall in 1911. It was again moved to the Vajirañāṇa Library in 1924, and was finally acquired by the Bangkok National Museum in 1968, where it is currently on permanent exhibition. Deciphering Detail, showing the characters Mongkut made initial studies of the inscription, and in 1836 established a commission, headed by monk-Prince Roek (who would later become Supreme Patriarch and hold the title Pavares Variyalongkorn), to handle its deciphering. In 1855, Mongkut (now king) presented a lithographic copy of the inscription, with annotations giving partial translations and a letter explaining its significance, to the British envoy John Bowring, and another copy was presented to the French envoy Charles de Montigny in 1856. The first attempted translation of the text into a Western language was published by the German polymath Adolf Bastian in 1864. French missionary Père Schmitt published his translation in 1884 and 1885, with further revisions in 1895 and 1898. Also in 1898, the first Thai-language work on the inscription was published in the Vajirañāṇa Magazine. A transliteration of the entire inscription into the modern Thai script was printed as a pamphlet for Crown Prince Vajiravudh's tour of the old Sukhothai Kingdom in 1908. In 1909, Cornelius Beach Bradley, Professor of Rhetoric at the University of California and an expert on the Siamese language, published an English-language translation of the inscription, which was later described as \\"the first reasonably satisfactory translation\\" of the inscription into a Western language. An authoritative transcription and translation (into French) was later made by George Cœdès, and published in 1924. Revisions published by A.B. Griswold and Prasert na Nagara in 1971 and the National Library in 1977 improved upon Cœdès's version, and Winai Pongsripian published the most recent Thai transliteration in 2009. Text The inscription contains 35 lines of text on its first and second sides, and 27 on the third and fourth. The script used is an early form of the Thai script (also known as Siamese), which differs vastly from modern Thai and bears some resemblance to ancient Khmer, from which it is considered to have been adapted.Danvivathana, Nantana. (1981). The orthography and the characteristics of the Sukhothai script and King Li Thai script. In The Thai Writing System (Doctoral dissertation, pp. 17-79). University of Edinburgh. Most significantly, the script contains no above- or below-line vowel marks, a feature seen in later Sukhothai inscriptions and modern Thai, as well as earlier Indic scripts. The text consists of three sections written continuously without distinct breaks. The first (lines 1–18 of the first side), which is written in the first person, tells the personal history of Ram Khamhaeng's early life up until his becoming ruler. The second (line 18 of the first side to line 11 of the fourth side) describes various aspects of the city of Sukhothai and its customs, including its abundance, people's freedoms, the ruler's justice, religious practices, and physical and geographical features. It ends by telling of Ram Khamhaeng's installation of a stone throne in the year 1214 of the Saka era (MS; corresponding to 1292 CE), enshrinement of relics at Si Satchanalai in MS 1207 (1285 CE) and his invention of the script in MS 1205 (1283 CE). The section refers to Ram Khamhaeng by name throughout. The third section (lines 11–27 of the fourth side) contains praise of the king and describes the reach of his kingdom. This final epilogue, which may have served as a eulogy, is written in a different hand, with some differences in spelling, indicating that it was most likely a later addition. According to Cœdès, the inscription was probably made to commemorate Ram Khamhaeng's installation of the stone throne in 1292, and this is the year to which it is generally dated. The inscription, which paints a picture of a plentiful kingdom ruled paternally by a benevolent king, was extremely influential in the development of Thai history. Based on works by Prince Damrong Rajanubhab during the 1910s–1920s, Sukhothai came to be regarded as the first Thai capital, a golden age during which Thai values flourished (as opposed to later Khmer-influenced Ayutthaya). This official view is taught in schools and formed the core of mainstream Thai history- writing throughout the 20th century. Controversy In July 1987, historian Michael Vickery presented a paper titled \\"The Ram Khamhaeng Inscription: A Piltdown Skull of Southeast Asian History?\\" at the International Conference on Thai Studies at the Australian National University, in which he drew together the arguments made by himself and others casting doubt on the authenticity of the inscription. These included the script used in the inscription, its vocabulary, and its content. His position was supported, most notably, by art historian Piriya Krairiksh, who published, in Thai in August 1988, further arguments that the stele was a forgery by Mongkut himself. The claims—shocking for the implication that most of Thai history would have to be rewritten—led to intense, often heated, scholarly debate, joined by dozens of academics both making rebuttals as well as giving support. Numerous seminars were held, and the debate continued through several publications, including a special volume (in Thai) published by Art & Culture (Silpa Wattanatham) magazine in 1988 and a compilation of English-language articles published in 1991 by the Siam Society. Although counter-arguments were made to address the claims, and a 1990 analysis using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy found the Ram Khamhaeng stele to be the same age (700–500 years) as four other Sukhothai inscriptions, several proponents remain convinced of the forgery theory, and the debate has not been definitively settled.An overview of the controversy is presented in Nevertheless, the inscription was successfully submitted to the UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme, and was inscribed on its register in 2003. The intense scrutiny and analysis also led to a much richer body of scholarship on the inscription, and several new theories have been proposed regarding its purpose and the exact circumstances of its creation. However, while it has been observed that \\"the Thai academic world showed a refreshing open-mindedness\\" in its response to the claims, the public has sometimes responded with hostility. A 2004 publication in a Thai newspaper by Piriya and British expatriate author Michael Wright (also a proponent of the forgery theory) led to angry protests in Sukhothai and threats by a politician to have them prosecuted for defaming the kings and harming national security.

The genus is restricted to Western Australia almost exclusively with a few exceptions: L. pusilla's range extends into South Australia, L. dubia's range extends through South Australia into Victoria and New South Wales, L. sonderi is native only to Victoria, and L. chippendalei is also found in the Northern Territory.Erickson, R. and Willis, J.H.

Aliso, 7(1): 13-64. All species of Levenhookia possess a sensitive labellum that performs a similar function to the column of Stylidium species. The labellum responds to touch and enables the plants to promote cross-pollination and avoid self-pollination. Most species of Levenhookia are ephemeral plants that prefer sand heath habitat. Levenhookia species also possess glandular trichomes similar to those of its sister genus, Stylidium. While no studies have been done to test Levenhookia for carnivory, it is plausible that they are carnivorous plants like the related Stylidium species.Darnowski, D.W., Carroll, D.M., Płachno, B., Kabanoff, E., and Cinnamon, E.

Evolution and taxonomy  Levenhookia preissii illustration from Johannes Mildbraed's 1908 monograph on the Stylidiaceae. The genus is known to be closely related to the genus Stylidium. Specifically, the subgenus Centridium is the subgeneric taxonomy in the genus Stylidium that appears to be most closely related to Levenhookia and most suggests an ancestral relationship. Sherwin Carlquist notes that Levenhookia is most likely a derivative of Stylidium and has relied on outcropping as its mode of evolution. The species in this genus represent a series from L. preissii, which requires cross pollination for reproduction, to L. dubia, which relies on facultative self-pollination. In an earlier publication, Rica Erickson described this series in reverse, suggesting that path as the evolutionary sequence.Erickson, R. (1958). Triggerplants. Paterson Brokensha Pty., Ltd., Perth, Australia. Several species of Stylidium have also been noted to mimic flower morphology of certain Levenhookia species to utilize similar available pollinators. Specifically, S. xanthopis mimics L. leptantha and S. ecorne mimics L. pauciflora. Three sections have been established and described by Johannes Mildbraed in 1908 to separate the subgeneric taxonomy in this genus. Section Coleostylis consists of L. chippendalei, L. preissii, L. stipitata, and possibly L. octomaculata, which Erickson described in 1956, noting its affinities with L. stipitata but without placing it in a section.Erickson, R. and Willis, J.H. (1956). Critical notes on Australian Stylidiaceae, with descriptions of three new species and two new varieties. The Victorian Naturalist, 72: 130-136. Section Estipitatae consists of L. dubia, L. leptantha, and L. sonderi, which was considered by Mildbraed to be a variety of L. dubia. Section Levenhookia consists of L. pusilla and L. pauciflora, though it could also contain L. pulcherrima, which Carlquist described in 1969 and noted its close association to the other two species in section Levenhookia but neglected to place it within a section. Section Levenhookia was originally described by Mildbraed as section Eulevenhookia, which was later changed to the current section title Levenhookia as an autonym since it is the type section.Mildbraed, J. (1908). Stylidiaceae. In: Engler, A. Das Pflanzenreich: Regni vegetabilis conspectus. IV. 278. Leipzig.The International Plant Names Index (2004). Levenhookia sect. Eulevenhookia Mildbr.

Fan Tan Alley (番攤里) is an alley in Victoria, British Columbia's Chinatown. It runs south from Fisgard Avenue to Pandora Avenue at the block between Government Street and Store Street. Named after the Chinese gambling game Fan-Tan, the alley was originally a gambling district with restaurants, shops, and opium dens. Today it is a tourist destination with many small shops including a barbershop, art gallery, Chinese cafe, apartments and offices. It is the narrowest street in Canada. At its narrowest point it is only wide. It was designated as a heritage property by the local government in 2001. In 2006, Dr. David C.

Constructioning and commissioning Onslow was laid down on 18 May 1942 by Lake Washington Shipyard at Houghton, Washington. She was launched on 20 September 1942, sponsored by Mrs. W. W. Fitts, and commissioned on 22 December 1943 with Commander Alden D. Schwarz in command.  World War II operations 1944-1945  After shakedown, Onslow departed the United States West Coast on 19 March 1944. She stopped at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Majuro before reporting for duty with Task Group 57.3 at Kwajalein. The seizure of Ujelang On 20 April 1944, Onslow was given the task of seizing Ujelang, a small island in the Marshall Islands occupied by Japanese troops. Embarking troops of the United States Armys 111th Infantry Regiment she rendezvoused with minesweeper USS YMS–91 on 21 April 1944. On the morning of 22 April 1944, 160 soldiers were put ashore to capture the island. They met resistance at the center of the island from 18 entrenched Japanese soldiers, who were killed, with no American casualties. During this time, Onslow came under attack by a twin-engined Mitsubishi G4M \\"Betty\\" bomber, which she drove off with 5-inch (127 mm) antiaircraft fire. Operations at Kwajalein and Eniwetok Onslow returned to Kwajalein on 25 April 1944 and spent the next six weeks there engaged in seaplane tending duties. She then was sent to Eniwetok, arriving there on 10 June 1944. Supporting landings on Saipan On 15 June 1944, in company with destroyer , Onslow escorted seaplane tender to Saipan. While on this passage she rescued a downed fighter pilot who was adrift in a raft, off Saipan. On 18 June 1944, three days after the initial landings on Saipan, Onslow took up duties tending the seaplanes of Patrol Squadron 16 (VP-16). On the morning of 10 September 1944, two Japanese swam from Saipan and succeeded in climbing aboard one of the moored seaplanes undetected. They proceeded to blow the plane up with hand grenades, and Onslow dispatched a boat to assist the planes crew. The boat was driven back under fire, but two additional boats joined in and they were then able to reach the plane and kill the boarders. However, gunfire set the plane's fuel ablaze, destroying it, although its crew was saved. Operations in the Palau Islands Onslow and seaplane tenders USS Pocomoke, , , and departed Saipan on 12 September 1944 to participate in the invasion of the Palau Islands. At noon on 16 September 1944 the formation entered Kossol Passage. The five ships tended seaplanes there under adverse conditions that included floating mines, dangerous coral heads, and rough water, not to mention the presence of enemy airplanes and submarines. On 13 November 1944, Onslow sped out to recover a Martin PBM Mariner flying boat down at sea with engine failure and towed it to Ulithi Atoll. She then returned to Kossol Passage. On 12 January 1945, three Japanese midget submarines entered the harbor, and the ships spent the day dodging coral heads trying to ferret out the elusive little submarines. One of the midget submarines was sunk; the other two escaped. Operations at Saipan On 17 January 1945, Onslow moved to Ulithi Atoll, and on 19 January 1945 she steamed for Guam. She then spent two months at Saipan beginning on 20 January 1945, providing services to CASU 48 bowser boats and the crews of two crash boats. Supporting the invasion of Okinawa On 23 March 1945, Onslow got underway for the invasion of Okinawa. Along with seaplane tenders USS Yakutat, , and , she escorted seaplane tenders , , and USS Chandeleur from Saipan to Kerama Retto, arriving there on 28 March 1945. Upon anchoring, the ships began to lay out a seadrome and by 29 March 1945, were operating on a regular schedule with 60 PBM Mariner seaplanes. Onslows work at Kerama Retto was more difficult than ever before. Many of the seaplanes were damaged by the Japanese or by heavy seas. Because of their frequency, it became necessary for the seaplane tenders to ignore Japanese air raids at times. On one occasion Onslow assisted in shooting down a Japanese fighter which was making a dive on her. Beginning about 1 June 1945, many of Japanese troops isolated on the small islands off Okinawa began coming to the beaches to surrender. When they did, Onslow notified the proper commands and often furnished shallow-draft boats to assist the U.S. Army in picking up the surrendering Japanese. On 6 August 1945, Onslow received orders to escort Chandeleur to Eniwetok via Saipan. She transferred all patrol squadron personnel and equipment to seaplane tender and departed Okinawa. Hostilities with Japan ceased and World War II came to an end on 15 August 1945, the same day she entered port at Eniwetok. Honors and awards Onslow earned four battle stars for her service in World War II, for: * Marshall Islands operation, March 1944-April 1944 * Marianas operation: Capture and occupation of Saipan, 14 June 1944 – 27 August 1944 * Western Caroline Islands operation: Capture and occupation of southern Palau Islands, 16 September 1944 – 13 November 1944 * Okinawa Gunto operation: Assault and occupation of Okinawa Gunto, 28 March 1945 – 6 August 1945 Peacetime service 1945-1947 With the end of the war, Onslow took up duties as part of Operation Magic Carpet, the return of U.S. military personnel overseas to the United States. She embarked military personnel at Eniwetok and transported them to Pearl Harbor and the United States West Coast. Onslow remained active for some time following the end of the war, participating in occupation duties in East Asia until 10 January 1947, when she returned to the United States for inactivation. She was decommissioned in June 1947 and placed in reserve.  Korean War service 1951-1953 and peacetime service 1953-1960 Onslow was reactivated in January 1951 to serve in the Korean War. She operated on a rotational basis, finishing four tours in the Western Pacific prior to 1955. During these tours, she spent most of her time in Iwakuni, Japan, tending seaplanes. She also provided services during the initial establishment of the Naval Air Station there in 1952. Onslow earned one battle star for her service in the Korean War, for Korean Defense Summer-Fall 1952 13 May 1952 – 22 May 1952 and 17 June 1952 – 27 June 1952 USS Onslow (AVP-48) in the Pescadores ca. 1956-1957.Between 24 June 1955 and 3 April 1956, Onslow had a long tour of duty on the U.S. West Coast, homeported at Alameda, California. Following this she began another Western Pacific tour, serving as the station ship in Hong Kong until August 1957. Returning to the United States again, Onslow provided services for various commands on the U.S. West Coast, with interim periods for upkeep and training.  Final decommissioning  Onslow was decommissioned for the second and final time on 22 April 1960 and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1960. She was sold on 18 October 1960 to the Philippine Presidents Line, Inc., for use as a commercial ferry. Still in service as a ferry in the Philippines in 1975, the former Onslow was among the ships that the U.S. Navy hired to assist in the evacuation of refugees from South Vietnam upon the collapse of that country at the end of the Vietnam War in April of that year.

It is part of the community of Llanbradach and Pwll-y-Pant. It is mostly residential, and contains three pubs, a primary school, a small local shopping area, a recreation ground, a library, two doctor's surgeries, and a youth centre. Being a traditional long and narrow South Wales Valleys village, its potential for expansion is restricted by the river on its eastern side and the hillside to the west. The village is served by Llanbradach railway station on the former Rhymney Railway line. The village is twinned with the village of Ploubezre in Brittany Naming Ordinarily, \\"Llan\\" means church or parish, but in this case the origin of the name may come from \\"Nant Bradach\\", which means \\"the banks of river Bradach\\" (\\"Bradach\\" is an Irish word meaning robbing or pilfering). Alternatively, the Welsh word \\"brad\\" (treachery or deceit) could have been coupled with the Irish \\"-ach\\" suffix (stream or river), creating \\"a treacherous stream\\" – possibly one that is prone to sudden, destructive floods. The name is thought to have come into being from around 1597. It is usually taken to be a hybrid Welsh and Irish Name, Nant-Bradach as above, which would indicate a period long before 1597 (when the Llanbradach Fawr farm and house is mentioned), when the Irish ravaged the Glamorgan coast and the Holms, leaving names around (Rheliw'r Gwyddyl). The flood happened because they built on a floodplain. History=Coal industry Llanbradach Colliery was opened in the 1890s, and reached peak production in the 1930s, but was shut down in 1961. A number of old mine buildings are still visible to the rear of the village.Llanbradach Colliery info: MinersAdvice.co.uk website. Llanbradach Viaduct The Barry Railway opened its main line from Cadoxton South to Trehafod in the Rhondda valley by 1888 but such was the demand for coal for shipment from Barry docks that they constructed another branch (the Penrhos branch) from Tynycaeau to join the Rhymney Railway at Penrhos, west of Caerphilly and it was opened on 1 August 1901. Demand for coal export increased still further and so the Barry Railway constructed an extension to run from a new Penrhos Lower Junction to join the Brecon & Merthyr Railway at Barry Junction (later Duffryn Isaf Junction) opposite Llanbradach and that opened on 2 January 1905. That extension circumvented the south-west of Caerphilly, and crossed the Rhymney Valley by means of the very impressive Llanbradach or Pwll-y-pant viaduct. The construction of this viaduct, north of Energlyn, was thus crucial to the establishment of the busy coal port at Barry, which dealt with nearly 4000 ships a year at its peak. That viaduct's length is the subject of conflicting data from various sources, one figure being 800 yards but the former GWR's assets diagrams do not agree with this but they do confirm that it comprised 16 spans of latticed 'N'-girders, 10 spanning just over 162 feet each and 5 of 36 feet, the remaining span distance not clear. That extension was shortlived however, and due to the railway grouping of 1922, being a duplicated route to the Rhymney valley, succumbed to closure on 4 August 1926 and was decommissioned. It was removed to be sold for scrap by 1938. The Penrhos and Penyrheol viaducts within the extension were removed by 1937. The brick support piers of the Llanbradach viaduct were demolished by explosives and their remains left as unsightly heaps across the valley for many decades but ultimately were removed with the general modernisation of the highways in the area. All that remains of the Pwll-y-pant viaduct is a single brick arch towards the western end of where the viaduct had run. A short part of the trackbed can still be seen near Energlyn. The rest of the trackbed was incorporated into the A468 Caerphilly bypass road, south-west of Caerphilly. The line carried on southwards from Penrhos through Ty Rhiw, and on to the Walnut Tree Viaduct, of similar construction, which itself was largely dismantled in 1969. As stated above, it was originally built, along with the Garth tunnel, for the Barry Railway's Penrhos Branch from a junction at Tynycaeau on the Cadoxton to Trehafod line, and the viaduct eased the uphill incline for empty coal wagon traffic between Tynycaeau Junction, the Taff Valley and Caerphilly but loaded down coal trains had to be partially braked, manually, over parts of the descent from Penrhos to Barry. There were no formal passenger stations along this stretch but it did see some summer passenger excursion traffic to Barry Island in steam days as late as 1961 and such ran from Tredegar and Nantybwch (Sirhowi valley). LLanbradach railway station When the route closed in 1963 following the destruction of Tynycaeau signal box by fire in March of that year, the section from Walnut Tree West at Steetley Doloma's smelter, meant a stay of execution for the line as far as Penrhos Junction and just one track of the double track branch was worked as a 'long siding'. All that remains of the Walnut Tree viaduct are an abutment, an angled pillar and the Taff Bank pier. The latter structure was used in 1977 for the display of messages of goodwill for the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth. Most of the remaining trackbed north of Walnut Tree Taffs Well is now incorporated into the Taff Trail. The remaining Cadoxton to Jct-Trehafod Jct (latterly Trefforest Jct) route, former Barry Railway's main line, also closed as a result of the Tynycaeau incident in 1963. Workmen's Welfare Hall and Institute The original Llanbradach Workmen's Institute, was a Miners' institute built in the 1900s, was constructed of timber and corrugated iron, and previously fulfilled the functions of village hall, school and a place for religious gatherings. A committee was set up in 1910 to organise the replacement of the old structure with a modern stone building. The new building was opened in 1913, and among the amenities available to the workmen were a snooker room, a small cinema, and a reading room and library. The hall remained in use certainly until the early 1980s (albeit in a declining state). It housed the village library, a billiards room, possibly a boxing gym and for theatrical productions by the local Coed-Y-Brain school. It was demolished at some point around the turn of the 21st Century and is now a car park. Governance At the most local level, Llanbradach elects eight community councillors to serve on Llanbradach & Pwll-y-pant Community Council. Llanbradach was an electoral ward to Mid Glamorgan County Council from 1989 until the council's dissolution in 1996. It subsequently became a ward for Caerphilly County Borough Council, electing two county councillors. Sports clubs=Football Llanbradach AFC was founded in 1986. Previously the Senior team played in the South Wales Alliance leagues but sadly the Senior team collapsed from 2015 to 2017. Meanwhile the club that trains boys and girls from under 6 years of age and upwards maintained a high level of coaching for the young people of Llanbradach. The Senior team have now reassembled in the summer of 2017 and are currently playing in the Taff-Ely and Rhymney Valley league Division one.

Napoleon's official correspondence refers to him as \\"Pierre Nicholas\\", but other accounts call him Jean Pierre Dorsaz and in Émile Bégin's 1853 Histoire de Napoleon he is named as Jean Baptiste Dorsaz. Bégin states Dorsaz was a relative of Jean Nicholas Dorsaz, the secretary of the commune, who related the story to Bégin in 1851.Bégin p.247 The journey itself took place after Napoleon returned from his military campaign in Egypt at the turn of the 19th century, to find that the Austrians had been able to reconquer Italy. Napoleon's plan was to cross to Italy with his army of over forty thousand men to launch a surprise assault on the Austrian armyHerold, J.C. p.134 (thirty five thousand light artillery and infantry, five thousand cavalry,Thiers, M.A. p.118 not including heavy field artillery such as large cannons and baggage trains). The journey through the Great St Bernard Pass (which was, after thorough consideration, decided to be the best possible route through the harsh AlpsAlison, Archibald p.26), commenced on the 15 May 1800 and took five days. Initially Napoleon and Dorsaz did not converse, but shortly after they started their ascent into the mountains the mule carrying Napoleon slipped on the icy ground and almost fell over a precipice. Dorsaz, walking between the mule and the edge of the track was able to prevent Napoleon and his mount tumbling over the side and though Napoleon showed no emotion at his lucky escape, he entered into conversation with his guide.Bégin p.249 It appears that the First Consul was determined to reward his guide for his actions as he questioned Dorsaz about his life in the village and the normal recompense for the guides. Dorsaz told Napoleon that the normal fee for the guides was three francs. Bégin recounts that Dorsaz said that his dream was to have a small farm, a field and cow. Napoleon asked him how much that would cost and when Dorsaz replied it would be 60 Louis he was given the money directly, but Napoleon's correspondence shows that he ordered 1200 francs to be paid to Dorsaz on 21 October 1800 for his \\"zeal and devotion to his task\\" during the crossing of the Alps, and other sources say this money was used to purchase a house for Dorsaz in Bourg-Saint-Pierre. Local legend also credits the money with securing Dorsaz a wife, as without a house he was unable to marry the girl he was in love with.De Cugnac p.447 NotesReferences *Bégin, E.

It is especially abundant in Israel. Description Greek sage grows high and wide, with the flower stalks rising or more above the foliage. The entire plant is covered with hairs, with numerous leaves of various sizes growing in clusters, giving it a silvery and bushy appearance. The flowers are pinkish-lavender, about long, growing in whorls along the inflorescence, and held in a small oxblood-red five-pointed hairy calyx. In its native environment it grows as part of the Maquis shrubland and several other open plant communities, but populations composed entirely of Salvia fruticosa are not uncommon. It is also grown as an ornamental flowering shrub, preferring full sun, well-draining soil, and good air circulation. Hardy to 20 degrees F., it is very drought resistant. The leaves have a high oil content, with some of the same chemicals as lavender. Taxonomy Due its wide variation in leaf shape, there has been a great deal of taxonomic confusion over the years, with many of the leaf variations of Salvia fruticosa being named as distinct species. These include S. libanotica, S. triloba, S. lobryana, and S. cypria, which are now considered to be Salvia fruticosa.\\"A number of taxa described from the E Mediterranean are nowadays considered as synonyms of Salvia fruticosa (Greuter & al. 1986). Their original descriptions suggest that they are characterized either by three lobed leaves (S. triloba L. fil.), or very small leaves (S. libanotica Boiss & Gaill.; S. cypria Kotschy; S. lobryana Aznav.).\\" Kintzios, pp. 35–36. The variation in leaf depends on geographical area, with plants growing on the western part of Crete having entire leaves with flat blade and margins and dark green upper sides. Plants growing on the eastern side of the island have much smaller leaves, with deeply three-lobed yellowish-green blade and undulate margins. The variation continues throughout different parts of Greece. Adding to the confusion over the name, the plant has also been called Salvia triloba, as named by Carl Linnaeus in 1781, until it was discovered that it was the same as the plant named by Philip Miller in 1768, with the earlier name receiving preference according to plant naming conventions. Local names include sage apple, Khokh barri, and Na’ama Hobeiq’es-sedr. Uses It has a long tradition of use in Greece, where it is valued for its beauty, medicinal value, and culinary use, along with its sweet nectar and pollen. Salvia fruticosa was depicted in a Minoan fresco circa 1400 BCE at Knossos on the island of Crete. The ancient Phoenicians and Greeks likely introduced the plant for cultivation to the Iberian peninsula, with remnant populations of these introduced plants still found in some coastal areas. Greek sage accounts for 50–95% of the dried sage sold in North America, and is grown commercially for its essential oil. It also has a long tradition of use in various Muslim rituals—for newborn children, at weddings, in funerals, and burnt as incense. A cross between S. fruticosa and Salvia officinalis developed in the middle east is called \\"silver leaf sage\\" or Salvia\\" Newe Ya'ar'\\", and is used in cooking. In its native habitat, it frequently develops woolly galls about 1 inch in diameter which are called 'apples'. These 'apples' are peeled and eaten when they are soft, and are described as being fragrant, juicy, and tasty. The formation of galls was originally thought to be limited to Salvia pomifera,Salvia pomifera, \\"apple-bearing sage\\". which led to the misidentification of many gall-bearing Salvia fruticosa plants. In 2001 it was discovered that the galls on Salvia fruticosa were caused by a previously undiscovered genus of Cynipid gall wasp.

He played six years in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the Detroit Tigers (1908), Brooklyn Superbas (1910–14), and Cincinnati Reds (1914). Early years Erwin was born in Forney, Texas, in 1885. He began his professional baseball career playing for the Fort Worth Panthers of the Texas League during the 1905 and 1906 seasons. He also played 11 games for the St. Paul Saints in the American Association during the 1906 season. In 1907, he played for the Topeka White Sox in the Western Association. In late August 1907, Erwin made his major league debut with the Detroit Tigers. He appeared in only eight games for Detroit and did not appear in any of the Tigers' postseason games in the 1907 World Series. After his brief stint with the Tigers, Erwin returned to the minor leagues, playing for the Rochester Bronchos of the Eastern League in 1908 and 1909. Brooklyn Erwin at Ebbetts Field, 1913 In August 1909, Erwin was purchased from Rochester by the Brooklyn Superbas of the National League. He played at the catcher position for Brooklyn from 1910 to 1914. In November 1912, the Sporting Life newspaper published a front-page photo profile of Erwin. The newspaper described him as \\"the rising young catcher of the Brooklyn National League.\\" The profile indicated that Erwin was married and made his permanent home in Rochester, New York, though his family lived in Galveston, Texas. In June 1913, Erwin suffered two fractures in his arm when Heinie Zimmerman of the Cubs slid into him at home plate. His playing time was limited thereafter. He appeared in only nine games for Brooklyn in 1914 before being released on waivers. The Sporting News later wrote that the collision with Zimmerman had \\"practically ended his career.\\" Cincinnati and minor leagues In July 1914, Erwin cleared waivers and was sent to Newark. Shortly thereafter, the Cincinnati Reds expressed interest in acquiring Erwin. Accordingly, he was reactivated by Brooklyn and thereupon sold to the Reds. He lasted less than three weeks in Cincinnati, appearing in only 12 games with his last major league game being on July 29, 1914. After being released by Cincinnati, Erwin continued to play professional baseball until 1921, including stints with the Rochester Hustlers (1915, 1918) and Dallas Submarines (1921). Erwin also served as a minor league umpire during the 1916 and 1917 seasons. Career statistics Erwin appeared in 276 major league games, compiling a .236 batting average and .326 on-base percentage with 150 hits, 82 bases on balls, 70 runs scored, 70 RBIs, 37 extra base hits, and 10 stolen bases. Later years After retiring from baseball, Erwin lived in Rochester, New York, with his wife and children, Adelaide and Ross, Jr. He worked for a time as a salesman and, in 1927, went into the insurance business. He served on the Rochester City Council from 1937 to 1945. In his later years, Erwin suffered from arthritis. He was hospitalized in February 1953 after a severe attack of arthritis. He died in a Rochester hospital in April 1953 at age 67.

The company operated stores under the Fisher's Big Wheel and Buy Smart names. At its peak, the chain comprised more than 100 stores in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States. The chain declared bankruptcy in 1993, selling some stores to Pamida and closing others. The chain closed in 1994. History Fisher's Big Wheel consolidated in 1939 following the consolidation of the Fisher Dry Goods company of New Castle, Pennsylvania and a hardware store called Big Wheel. While based in the New Castle area, its headquarters were actually in Neshannock Township just north of the city. The company's flagship store was located next door, and was used as a prototype store. After the company's liquidation, the headquarters became various medical offices, while supermarket chain Giant Eagle consolidated two nearby locations and moved into the former flagship store. Fisher's Big Wheel primarily located in smaller towns which were not already served by other discount retailers, while in other markets, it competed directly with such discounters as Zayre, Kmart, Wal-Mart and Hills Department Store. Several locations of Tempo and Buckeye Mart, two discount chains operated by Gamble- Skogmo, were also acquired by Fisher's in 1978. The stores were operated under the Fisher's Buckeye-Tempo nameplate. In 1986, the company's president, Peter H. Hollis, left the chain and became the CEO of Ames Department Stores, where he served for four years before becoming executive vice president of Jamesway. Big Wheel acquired ten former locations in 1989 from two discount chains in the Midwestern United States: eight from Danner's and two from Heck's Department Store. Fisher's Big Wheel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1993, closing ten of its stores. Fifty-five more stores were later closed in 1994 as a means of liquidation. Several locations were also sold to Pamida, a discount chain based in Omaha, Nebraska. On January 6, 1994 it began layoffs and liquidation under bankruptcy and closed the last of its operations by the end of the year.

Luo Dexiu entered the Tang Shou Tao (唐手道) school of Hong Yixiang (洪懿祥) in 1971, where he began his study of the Internal Martial Arts, devoting himself in the beginning to the use of these arts for fighting, with particular emphasis on Xingyiquan. He became one of Hong Yixiang's best fighters (Pa Kua Chang Journal, 1993). He later became deeply interested in Baguazhang, which was at the core of the skills taught by Hong Yixiang, having been passed directly from Zhang Junfeng (張俊峰), who trained under Gao Yisheng (高義盛), a master in the Cheng Tinghua (程廷華) branch of Baguazhang. Zhang Junfeng had brought the Gao style of Baguazhang to Taiwan. This lineage and school is called Yizong. Luo Dexiu studied Gao style Baguazhang with Hong Yixiang, and with many of Zhang's other students as well, including Hong Yixiang's brothers Hong Yiwen (洪懿文) and Hong Yimian (洪懿棉). He later continued his intensive studies of Baguazhang with Liu Qian, an early student of Sun Xikun. Luo Dexiu currently teaches Gao style Baguazhang and Hebei Xingyiquan, carrying on the Yizong tradition through his classes in Taipei, Taiwan, and holds seminar tours annually throughout Europe, America, and the Middle East.

The ship was named after the city of White Plains, New York, scene of the Battle of White Plains during the American Revolutionary War. Construction and commissioning White Plains was laid down on 2 October 1965 by the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company in San Diego. She was launched on 26 July 1966, sponsored by Mrs. Bob Wilson, and commissioned at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard at Long Beach, California, on 23 November 1968, with Captain Thomas B. Brenner in command. White Plains was used as the trial vessel for the class to mount the two Vulcan Phalanx CIWS. The ship retained the Phalanx systems after decision was made not to mount them on the rest of the class. Service history After fit out and shake down training, she began a series of Western Pacific deployments that made up the bulk of her career. Early deployments were in Vietnam's waters. Later deployments supported US Naval forces in the Persian Gulf. In 1978 The USS White Plains was struck by the USS Mount Vernon during an underway replenishment operation. In 1978 in the straits of Malacca the ship lost power and propulsion while being followed by a supertanker; collision was imminent, and the call went to man the life boat stations; collision was avoided, but it was a close call. In the late 1980s, the ship was one of the first U.S. Navy ships to have women sailors aboard. By 1991, and after a berthing retrofit accomplished in overhaul, the ship had a complement of female officers, and female senior and junior enlisted aboard. On 9 May 1989, while underway in the South China Sea en route to Guam, the White Plains experienced a major Class Bravo fire in the main engine room while conducting underway fuel replenishment with the combat replenishment ship USS Sacramento (AOE-1). The fire resulted from the ejection of a valve stem on the fuel transfer system which sent a high-pressure spray of fuel over the boiler and consequently ignited into a fireball. There were 6 fatalities and 161 injuries reported as a result of the fire. The cause of the valve stem ejection was a failure to follow proper tag-out procedures, a partially disassembled butterfly valve, poor validation of the fuel transfer checklist, and subsequent pressurization of the fuel line containing the valve.http://www.damagecontrolmuseums.org/Ship_Cas_history/WHITEPLAINS/WHITEPLAINS_n.html Webpage on SHIPBOARD DAMAGE CONTROL, PERSONNEL PROTECTION, FIREFIGHTING AND CBR-D MUSEUM WEBSITE In January 1991, the White Plains was relieved from its deployment in the Persian Gulf by sister ship . In early August 1992, the ship received an extensive refit, including her main steam plant. Later that same month, as the ship was unable to be leave on its own power, its mooring lines were reinforced with anchor chain and steel cables to keep it moored to the pier as Typhoon Omar approached the island of Guam. On 27 August 1992, under the command of Capt. Robin Y. Weber, the ship weathered the initial pass of the eye of Super Typhoon Omar. After a relative calm and then the final pass of the eye of Typhoon Omar, White Plains was torn from her moorings. The ship with its skeleton crew rode out Omar's 150 mph winds in Apra Harbor. The ship ultimately ran aground on the coral beach. The responsibility for the safe mooring of a ship during repair lies with the shipyard. At the beginning of the repair availability, the ship's first lieutenant met with Ship Repair Facility Guam engineers and developed a plan to moor the ship in the event of a typhoon. The plan took into account the surface area of exposed portions of the ship and pounds per square inch of expected force generated by typhoon winds along with the strength of pier cleats, bollards and deadmen. The plan required more lines than were a part of the ship's normal complement. An agreement was reached about which lines would be provided by the ship and which would be provided by the shipyard. All lines were to be of nylon construction. On the morning of the storm's approach the shipyard riggers used springlay mooring lines. Springlay is a combination of wire and synthetic fiber and does not stretch. Nylon mooring lines can stretch up to a third of their length with no damage to the line. Despite the first lieutenant's protest of the incompatibility of the two types of mooring lines, the shipyard's riggers claimed they had no other lines available. This resulted in the springlay mooring lines holding almost the full force of the winds while the strength of the nylon mooring lines was not fully utilized. The springlay lines gave way followed by the nylon lines. In the weeks following Typhoon Omar, the eyes of two other typhoons passed over the ship while still in the shipyard. During these events the original mooring plan was utilized using all nylon mooring lines and the ship rode out both typhoons with no problems. Very fortunate to have run aground near Polaris Point, after the ship left the pier in the storm, the ship lost its only power source for a day, a notoriously fickle emergency diesel generator. The generator situation was corrected after several hours and troubleshooting, and ultimately solved by a simple observation made by the electrical officer, LTJG Lee, that a control governor mechanical linkage was undone. Essential power for emergency services were restored to the ship, enabling the crew to handle any flooding or fire that would occur. While the ship was aground for 3–5 days, the crew sustained on MREs, and helped plan, along with harbor operations, for her ungrounding. There was no real damage to the ship's hull. The ship recovered completely from the grounding and was underway for Gulf operations in May 1993. The ship, well past her life cycle and usefulness to the U.S. Navy, was decommissioned in 1995.

Evolution of temperatures in the Post-Glacial period following the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), according to Greenland ice cores. The warm Holocene period with the 8.2 kiloyear event. Central Greenland ice core reconstructed temperature up to mid-19th century. In climatology, the 8.2-kiloyear event was a sudden decrease in global temperatures that occurred approximately 8,200 years before the present, or c. 6,200 BC, and which lasted for the next two to four centuries. It defines the start of the Northgrippian age in the Holocene epoch. Milder than the Younger Dryas cold spell before it but more severe than the Little Ice Age after it, the 8.2-kiloyear cooling was a significant exception to general trends of the Holocene climatic optimum. During the event, atmospheric methane concentration decreased by 80 ppb, an emission reduction of 15%, by cooling and drying at a hemispheric scale. Identification A rapid cooling around 6200 BC was first identified by Swiss botanist Heinrich Zoller in 1960, who named the event Misox oscillation (for the Val Mesolcina). It is also known as Finse event in Norway. Bond et al. argued that the origin of the 8.2-kiloyear event is linked to a 1,500-year climate cycle; it correlates with Bond event 5. The strongest evidence for the event comes from the North Atlantic region; the disruption in climate shows clearly in Greenland ice cores and in sedimentary and other records of the temperate and the tropical North Atlantic. It is less evident in ice cores from Antarctica and in South American indices. The effects of the cold snap were global, however, most notably in its changes in sea level. Cooling event The event may have been caused by a large meltwater pulse from the final collapse of the Laurentide Ice Sheet of northeastern North America, most likely when the glacial lakes Ojibway and Agassiz suddenly drained into the North Atlantic Ocean. The same type of action produced the Missoula floods that created the Channeled scablands of the Columbia River basin. The meltwater pulse may have affected the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation, reducing northward heat transport in the Atlantic and causing significant North Atlantic cooling. Estimates of the cooling vary and depend somewhat on the interpretation of the proxy data, but drops of around have been reported. In Greenland, the event started at 8175 BP, and the cooling was 3.3 °C (decadal average) in less than 20 years. The coldest period lasted for about 60 years, and its total duration was about 150 years. The meltwater causation theory is, however, thrown into speculation because of inconsistencies with its onset and an unknown region of impact. Researchers suggest that the discharge was probably superimposed upon a longer episode of cooler climate lasting up to 600 years, and it was merely one contributing factor to the event as a whole. Further afield, some tropical records report a cooling, based on cores drilled into an ancient coral reef in Indonesia. The event also caused a global CO2 decline of about 25 ppm over about 300 years. However, dating and interpretation of other tropical sites are more ambiguous than the North Atlantic sites. In addition, climate modeling work shows that the amount of meltwater and the pathway of meltwater are both important in perturbing the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation. The initial meltwater pulse caused between of sea-level rise. Based on estimates of lake volume and decaying ice cap size, values of circulate. Based on sea-level data from the Mississippi Delta, the end of the Lake Agassiz–Ojibway (LAO) drainage occurred at 8.31 to 8.18 ka and ranges from 0.8 to 2.2 m. The sea-level data from the Rhine–Meuse Delta indicate a of near-instantaneous rise at 8.54 to 8.2 ka, in addition to 'normal' post-glacial sea-level rise. Meltwater pulse sea-level rise was experienced fully at great distance from the release area. Gravity and rebound effects associated with the shifting of water masses meant that the sea-level fingerprint was smaller in areas closer to the Hudson Bay. The Mississippi Delta records around 20%, Northwestern Europe 70% and Asia records 105% of the globally averaged amount. The cooling of the 8.2-kiloyear event was a temporary feature; but the sea-level rise of the meltwater pulse was permanent. In 2003, the Office of Net Assessment (ONA) at the United States Department of Defense was commissioned to produce a study on the likely and potential effects of a modern climate change. The study, conducted under ONA head Andrew Marshall, modeled its prospective climate change on the 8.2-kiloyear event, precisely because it was the middle alternative between the Younger Dryas and the milder Little Ice Age. North Africa and Mesopotamia Drier conditions were notable in North Africa, and East Africa suffered five centuries of general drought. In West Asia, especially Mesopotamia, the 8.2-kiloyear event was a 300-year aridification and cooling episode, which may have provided the natural force for Mesopotamian irrigation agriculture and surplus production, which were essential for the earliest formation of classes and urban life. However, changes taking place over centuries around the period are difficult to link specifically to the approximately 100-year abrupt event, as recorded most clearly in the Greenland ice cores. In particular, in Tell Sabi Abyad, Syria, significant cultural changes are observed at c. 6200 BC; the settlement was not abandoned at the time.

The city has a population of 8,062 inhabitants, while the municipality has 49,242 inhabitants at the 2000 census.XII Censo General de Población y Vivienda 2000. Principales resultados por localidad. Puebla, Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e Informática, 2000. The name means place where straw is counted, and it originates from Nahuatl roots: zacatl – straw; pohuatl – to count; and tlān – place. The name comes from the tribute people had to pay, i.e. as bales of straw. The BUAP has a Regional Section there, which offers degrees in law, business administration and psychology. Geography The city of Zacapoaxtla is located on a mountainous terrain on the northern part of the state, on the morphological region known as Sierra Norte or Sierra de Puebla, amidst the Sierra Madre Oriental. The city is surrounded by three mountains: \\"Tres cabezas\\" (Three Heads), \\"Gran poder de Dios\\" (Great Power of God) and the \\"Apaxtepec\\", an extinct volcano. The municipality of Zacapoaxtla is located in the sub-basin of the Apulco River within the Tecolutla River basin.  Climate History Though there are only a few archeological references, it is known that Nahua-Chichimecas people with Totonac background lived in this region. At the beginning of our era, almost the whole northeastern part of the now state of Puebla belonged to Totonacapan, and by the twelfth century this region was part of Chichimecatlalli, to which the Manor of Tlatlauhquitepec belonged, including Zacapoaxtla. Other versions indicate that around the year 1270, the Apaxtepec volcano erupted burying the town of Xaltetelli, thus giving origin to the town of Zacapoaloyan, nowadays Zacapoaxtla. In any case, the people who lived around were subdued under the rule of the Triple Alliance \\"Huey-Tlatocayotl\\", and brought under the rule of the Manor of Texcoco. In 1524, after the Spanish conquest, Tlatlauhquitepec (along with Zacapoaxtla) was entrusted to Jacinto Portillo, Spanish conqueror who would later become a missionary of the Order of Friars Minor of St. Francis, known as Fra Cintos. Zacapoaxtla had its first, rustic, church in 1576 under the advocacy of Saint Peter that was later substituted by another during the first half of the 17th century. The village obtained the category of town on 11 March 1826, after the end of the Mexican War of Independence. On 1 April 1835, the town became seat of the municipality. The town became widely known after the Battle of Puebla on 5 May 1862, when Zacapoaxtlans fought bravely against the French army. The local population fought once more against the military intervention on 25 April 1863, at the convent of Saint Agnes in the city of Puebla. In 1864, General Fernando María Ortega, governor of the state of Puebla, declared the Town of Zacapoaxtla \\"La ciudad del 25 de abril\\" (\\"The City of 25 April\\") as a memorial to these events.

In the reformed orthography it is spelled Տիգրան Չուխաջյան ; 1837 – March 11, 1898) was an Ottoman Armenian composer and conductor, and the founder of the first opera institution in the Ottoman Empire. He is considered the first opera composer in Turkish history.  Biography  Chukhajian was born in Constantinople. He studied at composer Gabriel Yeranian's class, then had classes in Milan. Along with other Armenian intellectuals of that period he fought for the development of national culture, organized Armenian musical societies, theatres, schools, papers and free concerts. In his works, Chukhajian used the elements of European musical techniques and Armenian folk melodies.Чухаджян Тигран Геворгович. Great Soviet Encyclopedia, accessed 22 June 2019. He is an author of pieces for piano, songs and romances, chamber and symphonic works, operas.

They are most famous for scoring the surfing documentary The Endless Summer. History The Sandals began in 1962, when Danny Brawner, a drummer, joined a high-school group called The Twangs, headed up by the brothers Gaston and Walter Georis. The Twangs were a group heavily influenced by The Ventures. At this point, the core of The Sandals was formed: Brawner on drums, Gaston on keyboards, Walter on rhythm guitar, John Blakeley on lead guitar with his brother, David, on bass. David was replaced by John Gibson early on. The band changed their name to The Shadows, and eventually settled on The Sandells, a portmanteau of \\"Sand\\" and \\"ells\\", a popular ending for groups at the time. They released their first album, Scrambler!, in early 1964. They partnered with World Pacific Records for the release, which allowed them to come in contact with Bruce Brown, who was then just beginning editing work on his next documentary project, The Endless Summer. Brawner and the Georis brothers met with Brown in Long Beach at a surf fair, hoping to sell him one of the Sandals songs for use on Brown's new film. Brown, however, was so impressed by their music that he agreed to use a number of their songs in the film. It was agreed that all film profit would go to Brown, and all soundtrack profit to go to The Sandells. The group used the studio time that working on the film gave them to release a number of LPs and Singles during this period. Jim King worked with the group at this time, producing a number of songs, including \\"Always\\" and \\"All Over Again\\", both of which received limited national radio airplay. The group also slightly modified their name during this time, to the surf-inspired \\"The Sandals\\". For a time, the group toured with the film, providing live backing for the live narration by Bruce Brown. After The Endless Summer film reached nationwide distribution, The Sandals recorded the song \\"Endless Summer\\", one of their first songs with vocals. The song was a departure in a number of ways, and not just relating to the vocals. They were attempting a Beach Boys-esque sound, with mixed results. They also re-released the Scrambler! LP as The Endless Summer, along with new single records similarly retitled. In 1967, Dick Barrymore hired The Sandals to score his skiing documentary, The Last of the Ski Bums. As on Scrambler!, John Blakeley's songwriting skills were at the forefront of the album — 10 of the 12 songs contained at least some of his input. However, this album also marked Danny's departure from the band after he refused to leave San Clemente, California, where the band had been based, for Riverside, California. He was replaced by Steve Ekwall, who played on the album. Soon after the release of the Last of the Ski Bums album, the group broke up. The Georis brothers went on to start the restaurant Casanova in Carmel, California in 1977, and, in 1983, Walter established the restaurant Fandango in Pacific Grove, California; Walter Georis established Georis Winery on of Cachaqua ranchland from the ocean in upper Carmel Valley in the early 1980s and began selling wine since 1982 including the Endless Summer label. In 2011, Walter and Sylvia Georis established Cowgirl Winery with assistance from Damien Georis. Both of these wineries are in the Carmel Valley AVA wine region of California. Danny Brawner worked for Mobile Surfboards. John Blakeley remained involved in music, joining Stoneground in 1971. There have been two reunions to date: in 1992, the Georis brothers and Blakeley reformed the band, and released a few albums, most notably working on The Endless Summer II. They also rerecorded (in 1992) the original album (that includes a few new songs) using some of the original instruments. In 2002, the Georis', Blakeley, Gibson, and Brawner played at the Galaxy Theater in Santa Ana, California, to a packed house.

In its last years, the Tribune was managed and printed by The MetroWest Daily News, and owned by Community Newspaper Company, a division of GateHouse Media. In 2010, the Tribune printed its last daily edition, and was replaced by a weekly newspaper called the Waltham News Tribune. It no longer covers Newton.  History  By 1980, the News-Tribune was part of a five-paper chain, Transcript Newspapers Inc., that included the Daily Transcript of Dedham and three weekly newspapers in West Roxbury-Roslindale (neighborhoods of Boston), Newton and Needham (suburbs west of Boston). Between August 1984 and March 1986, the company was sold four times: to Gillett Communications in 1984; then to Thomson Newspapers that December; in April 1985 to William Dean Singleton (head of MediaNews Group) \\\\-- and eventually, in 1986, to Harte-Hanks, which combined it with the Middlesex News to form News-Transcript Group. News- Transcript, a chain of three dailies and several weekly newspapers stretching from Boston west to Framingham, Massachusetts, remained a Harte-Hanks property until 1994, when the company continued its divestment of print properties by selling the Massachusetts papers to Fidelity Investments' Community Newspaper Company, already the publisher of dozens of weeklies in the Boston suburbs. A 1999 fire destroyed the News-Tribune office at 99 Moody Street, Waltham, but the paper continued to publish, initially settling in CNC's Needham headquarters before returning to a new office in Waltham. CNC changed the newspaper's name, in 1999, to The Daily News Tribune, to emphasize the paper's connections its sister papers. In 2000, Fidelity sold CNC to the publisher of the Boston Herald. The new owner instituted a content-sharing arrangement between CNC and the Herald, resulting in a regular stream of Daily News stories appearing in the Boston newspaper. That arrangement continued for a time after the Herald sold CNC to Liberty Group Publishing (later renamed GateHouse Media) in 2006. After converting The Daily News Transcript to a weekly newspaper in 2009, GateHouse made a similar move with its Waltham property in August 2010, adopting a semiweekly printing schedule for the renamed Waltham News Tribune, and focusing that paper's coverage on its home city. GateHouse continued to cover Newton via the Newton Tab, a weekly newspaper that CNC had owned since 1992. One year later, in July 2011, the Waltham News Tribune printed its final Tuesday edition, converting to once-a- week publication on Fridays.

In 293 major league games, Drill compiled a .258 batting average and a .353 on-base percentage. He also served as the manager of the Terre Haute Hottentots in 1908. He later served as the United States Attorney for Minnesota from 1929 to 1931. Early years Drill was born in Browerville, Minnesota, in 1877. He attended Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota. He was the catcher for the Georgetown baseball team. Professional baseball Drill began his professional baseball career in 1902 as a catcher for the Washington Senators and Baltimore Orioles. He compiled a .262 batting average in 73 games during the 1902 season. He returned to the Senators in 1903 and 1904. Drill joined the Detroit Tigers in July 1904.

According to a letter in the Detroit Tiger records in the Detroit public library Frank Navin, secretary and future owner of the Detroit Tigers, offered him a contract for the 1906 season. Drill, who was making more money as a lawyer turned down the offer. In 293 major league games, Drill had a .258 batting average and .353 on-base percentage. His .359 on-base percentage in 1904 was the sixth highest in the American League. Although his major league career ended in 1905, he continued playing in the minor leagues for another four years with the St. Paul Saints (1906), Pueblo Indians (1907), Terre Haute Hottentots (1908), and Superior Blues (1909). He also served as the manager of Terre Haute in 1908. Later years Drill was a lawyer.

The name refers to the optimization of the amount of distortion (loss of video quality) against the amount of data required to encode the video, the rate. While it is primarily used by video encoders, rate-distortion optimization can be used to improve quality in any encoding situation (image, video, audio, or otherwise) where decisions have to be made that affect both file size and quality simultaneously. Background The classical method of making encoding decisions is for the video encoder to choose the result which yields the highest quality output image. However, this has the disadvantage that the choice it makes might require more bits while giving comparatively little quality benefit. One common example of this problem is in motion estimation, D. T. Hoang, P. M. Long, and Jeffrey Vitter, Rate-Distortion Optimizations for Motion Estimation in Low-Bitrate Video Coding, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 8(4), August 1998, 488-500. A shorter version appears in Proceedings of the Digital Video Compression Conference, IS&T;/SPIE 1996 Symposium on Electronic Imaging: Science & Technology, 2668, San Jose, CA, January-February 1996, 18-27. and in particular regarding the use of quarter pixel-precision motion estimation. Adding the extra precision to the motion of a block during motion estimation might increase quality, but in some cases that extra quality isn't worth the extra bits necessary to encode the motion vector to a higher precision. How it works Rate-distortion optimization solves the aforementioned problem by acting as a video quality metric, measuring both the deviation from the source material and the bit cost for each possible decision outcome. The bits are mathematically measured by multiplying the bit cost by the Lagrangian, a value representing the relationship between bit cost and quality for a particular quality level. The deviation from the source is usually measured as the mean squared error, in order to maximize the PSNR video quality metric. Calculating the bit cost is made more difficult by the entropy encoders in modern video codecs, requiring the rate-distortion optimization algorithm to pass each block of video to be tested to the entropy coder to measure its actual bit cost. In MPEG codecs, the full process consists of a discrete cosine transform, followed by quantization and entropy encoding. Because of this, rate-distortion optimization is much slower than most other block-matching metrics, such as the simple sum of absolute differences (SAD) and sum of absolute transformed differences (SATD). As such it is usually used only for the final steps of the motion estimation process, such as deciding between different partition types in H.264/AVC.

While playing for Boston, he led the National League's third basemen in putouts in 1902 and 1903, in fielding percentage in 1902, in assists in 1903, and in double plays turned in 1903. Early years Gremminger was born in 1874 in Canton, Ohio. Professional baseball Gremminger began playing professional baseball in 1895 for the Cleveland Spiders. He made his major league debut at age 21 on April 21, 1895. He appeared in 20 games for the Spiders, all at third base, and compiled a .269 batting average with 15 RBIs in 78 at bats. After his brief stint with the Spiders, Gremminger spent the next six years in the minor leagues with the Oil City Oilers of the Iron and Oil League (1895) and the Buffalo Bisons (1896–1899) and Rochester Bronchos (1900-1901), both of the Eastern League. In 1901, his batting average increased dramatically to .343 with a slugging percentage of .529. On December 11, 1901, the Boston Beaneaters purchased Gremminger from Rochester, giving him a second shot at the major leagues. He appeared in 140 games as the starting third baseman for the 1902 Boston Beaneaters, compiling a .257 batting average with a .314 on-base percentage and .347 slugging percentage. His 65 RBIs ranked eighth in the National League, and his 33 extra-base hits ranked ninth. Defensively, he led the National League's third basemen with 222 putouts and a 951 fielding percentage and ranked third with 282 assists. Gremminger returned to the Beaneaters in 1903 and again appeared in 140 games. He hit .264 with a .313 on-base percentage and .376 slugging percentage. His 56 strikeouts ranked fourth in the National League. Defensively, he led the National League's third basemen in putouts (217), assists (300), and double plays turned (20). His .935 fielding percentage ranked third among the league's third basemen. On February 24, 1904, the Detroit Tigers purchased Gremminger from the Beaneaters. He appeared in 83 games at third base for the 1904 Tigers. His batting average dropped by 50 points to .214 in 309 at bats. He appeared in his last major league game on July 30, 1904. He was replaced at third base by Bill Coughlin who was acquired by the Tigers in late July. In 383 major league games, Gremminger compiled a .251 batting average, .301 on- base percentage, and .340 slugging percentage, with 164 RBIs and 89 extra-base hits. In August 1904, the Tigers sold Gremminger to the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association in exchange for cash and Minneapolis' \\"best player\\" at the end of the season.

Over the years Moeller's main influences have been from Freddie King, Lightnin' Hopkins, Earl King and Grant Green to a wide variety of soul, funk and rock artists. He began playing in Dallas and Fort Worth blues clubs while still in high school. During the summers Moeller and his year and a younger brother Jay Moeller, who plays drums traveled from their home in Denton down to Austin. The summer they were 16 and 15 they meet Clifford Antone of the Austin blues club Antone's. The first night Moeller played on Antone's stage was with Little Charlie & The Nightcats. After Moeller finished high school in Denton he moved to Austin Texas working in many of the city's well known venues and often soaked in the music of the constant stream of blues, and rock artists performing at Antone's . Amongst those that played Antone's were Earl King, Albert Collins, and James Cotton. Years later the Austin Chronicle quoted Clifford Antone (who also helped launch Stevie Ray Vaughan) as saying: \\"Johnny, nobody can burn like that kid. He's got the heart like Stevie had, about the only one I've seen with that kind of heart. Johnny's so quiet and bashful, just a sweet kid and sometimes those kids get overlooked.\\" By the time Moeller had joined The Fabulous Thunderbirds in mid-2007 he had toured North America, Europe, Australia, and Japan extensively. Johnny remains based in Austin, Texas with his wife Shontae Moeller and three children Estella, Calvin, and Lucille Moeller playing local, and regional venues when he is not touring with The Fabulous Thunderbirds.

The area's indigenous people settled there due to the fertile hunting grounds and abundance of salmon in the Spokane River. The first European to explore the Inland Northwest was Canadian explorer-geographer David Thompson, working as head of the North West Company's Columbia Department. At the nexus of the Little Spokane and the Spokane, Thompson's men built a new fur trading post, which is the first long-term European settlement in Washington state. The first American settlers, squatters J.J. Downing, with his wife, stepdaughter, and S.R. Scranton, built a cabin and established a claim at Spokane Falls in 1871. James N. Glover and Jasper Matheney, two Oregonians passing through the region in 1873, recognized the value of the Spokane River and its falls. They realized the development potential and bought the claims of and the sawmill from Downing and Scranton for $4,000 total. Glover and Matheney knew that the Northern Pacific Railroad Company had received a government charter to build a main line across this northern route. By 1881, the Northern Pacific Railway was completed, bringing major European settlement to the area. With the arrival of the Northern Pacific Railroad and the later additions to the city's railroad infrastructure by the arrival of the Union Pacific, Great Northern, and Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific railroads, Spokane became the commercial center of the Inland Northwest. It was one of the most important rail centers in the western United States. Spokane hosted the first environmentally themed World's Fair in Expo '74, becoming the then-smallest city to ever host a World's Fair. With falling silver, timber, and farm prices, the city economy began a decline that would last into the 1990s. Spokane is still trying to make the transition to a more service-oriented economy. The opening of the River Park Square Mall in 1999 sparked a downtown rebirth that included the building of the Spokane Arena and expansion of the Spokane Convention Center. Pre-contact to 1810=First habitation  Spokane Falls in 1888 The Spokane Falls and its surroundings were a gathering place and focus for settlement for the area's indigenous people for thousands of years, due to the fertile hunting grounds and abundance of salmon in the Spokane River. The first humans to arrive in the Spokane area arrived between 12,000 and 8,000 years ago and were hunter-gatherer societies who lived off the plentiful game in the area. Initially, the settlers hunted predominantly bison and antelope, but after the game migrated out of the region, the native people became dependent on gathering various roots, berries, and nuts, and harvesting fish.Ruby et al. (2006) pp. 5–6 The Spokane tribe, after which the city is named (which means \\"Children of the Sun\\" or \\"sun people\\" in SalishanPhillips (1971), pp. 134–135Ruby et al. (2006), pp. 7–8), are believed to be either direct descendants of the original hunter-gatherers who settled in the region, or descendants of tribes that migrated to the area from the Great Plains. When asked about their origins by early white explorers, the tribe said their ancestors came from \\"Up North\\". The Spokane Falls were the tribe's center of trade and fishing. The Spokane consisted of three bands that lived along the Spokane River.Ruby et al. (2006), p. 12 The Spokane people shared their culture and Salishan language with several other tribes, including the Coeur d' Alenes, Kalispels, Pend Oreilles, Flatheads, Kootenays, and Colvilles among others. Early in the 19th century, the Northwest Fur Company sent two white fur trappers west of the Rocky Mountains to search for fur.Ruby et al (2006), p. 34 They were friendly with the native people they encountered. The trappers became the first two white men met by the Spokane tribe, who believed them to be Sama, or sacred. They helped them get shelter in the Colville River valley for the winter.Ruby et al (2006), p. 35 The tribe discovered the men brought no \\"big magic\\" to the tribe, as their members had continued to die from smallpox, which had first struck the tribe in an epidemic in 1782. As much as half the tribe had died in that epidemic.Ruby et al (2006), p. 29 1810–1890=Trading post The explorer-geographer David Thompson, working as head of the North West Company's Columbia Department, became the first European to explore the Inland Empire (now often called the Inland Northwest).Stratton (2005), p. 19 Crossing what is now the U.S.–Canada border from British Columbia, Thompson wanted to expand the North West Company further south in search of furs. After establishing the Kullyspell House and Saleesh House trading posts in what are now Idaho and Montana, Thompson then attempted to expand further west. He sent out two trappers, Jacques Raphael Finlay and Finan McDonald, to construct a fur trading post on the Spokane River in Washington and trade with the local Indians. This post was established in 1810, at the confluence of the Little Spokane and Spokane rivers, becoming the first enduring European settlement of significance in Washington state. Known as the Spokane House, or simply \\"Spokane\\", it was in operation from 1810 to 1826. Operations were run by the British North West Company and later the Hudson's Bay Company, and the post was the headquarters of the fur trade between the Rocky and Cascade mountains for 16 years. After the latter business absorbed the North West Company in 1821, the major operations at the Spokane House were eventually shifted north to Fort Colvile, reducing the post's significance.Meinig (1993), p. 69 Samuel Parker, who visited the area in 1836 In 1836, Reverend Samuel Parker visited the area and reported that around 800 Native Americans were living in Spokane Falls.Ruby (1988), p. 75 A medical mission was established by Marcus and Narcissa Whitman to cater for Cayuse Indians and hikers of the Oregon Trail at Walla Walla in the south. After the Whitmans were killed by Indians in 1847, Reverend Cushing Eells established Whitman College in the city of city of Walla Walla, Washington in their memory. Rev. Eells built the first church in Spokane in 1881.Durham (1912), pp. 100–101 Between 1881 and 1882 the first Baptist and Episcopal churches were started, and the first Presbyterian church in 1883.Durham (1912), pp. 356–357 In 1853, Washington Territory was established and its first governor, Isaac Stevens, made an initial effort to make a treaty with Chief Garry and the Spokanes at Antoine Plantes’ Ferry, not far from Millwood. An increasing American settler presence in Washington Territory caused simmering tensions and conflicts between the Native American tribes and white settlers, many miners en route to seek fortune in the gold fields in the Colville district. These conflicts and reprisals eventually prompted intervention from the United States Army on October 5, 1855, starting the Yakima Indian War. The last campaign of this war, the Coeur d'Alene War, was brought to a close by the actions of Col. George Wright, who won decisive victories against a confederation of tribes in engagements at the Battle of Four Lakes and the Battle of Spokane Plains,Stratton (2005), p. 81-83 avenging an earlier loss under Lt. Col. Edward Steptoe at the Battle of Pine Creek. Wright's actions ended the hostilities and opened the mountain valley of the Pacific Northwest to safe habitation by settlers.Stratton (2005), p. 84 American settlement Joint American–British occupation of Oregon Country, in effect since the Treaty of 1818, eventually led to the Oregon Boundary Dispute after a large influx of American settlers along the Oregon Trail. The first American settlers in what is now Spokane were J.J. Downing and S.R. Scranton, cattle ranchers who squatted and established a claim at Spokane Falls in 1871.Kensel (1971), p. 19 Together they built a small sawmill on a claim near the south bank of the falls. James N. Glover and Jasper Matheney, Oregonians passing through the region in 1873, recognized the value of the Spokane River and its falls for the purpose of water power. They realized the investment potential and bought the claims of and the sawmill from Downing and Scranton for a total of $4,000.Schmeltzer (1988), p. 39 Glover and Matheney knew that the Northern Pacific Railroad Company had received a government charter to build a main line across this northern route. Amid many delays in construction and uncertainty over the completion of the railroad and its exact course, Matheney sold his interest in the claim to Glover.Kensel (1971), p. 20 Glover confidently held on to his claim and became a successful Spokane business owner and mayor. He later came to be known as the \\"Father of Spokane\\".Schmeltzer (1988), p. 40 Fort Spokane Fort Spokane Hospital ca. 1933 In 1880, Fort Spokane was established by U.S. Army troops under Lt. Col. Henry Clay Merriam northwest of Spokane, at the junction of the Columbia and Spokane Rivers, to protect the construction of the Northern Pacific Railway and secure a place for U.S. settlement. Settlers among the Spokane and Colville Indians in Eastern Washington were afraid that war might break out. Camp Spokane served to separate the Indians from the settlers, being located between the Colville and Spokane reservations—protecting the growing non- Indian communities of Spokane Falls (later Spokane) and Cheney. While stationed, Merriam's troops erected some temporary buildings at the post, which they initially called Camp Spokane, but in 1881 one of the four infantry companies was still living in tents. Then early in 1882, President Arthur formally set aside a military reservation at the site, which was renamed Fort Spokane. The Railroad and Population Boom Spokane's historic Northern Pacific Railway Depot The Northern Pacific Railway's northern transcontinental route, funded by a huge federal land grant in 1864, started construction in 1870, near Duluth, Minnesota headed west, meanwhile starting in Portland, Oregon headed north to Seattle, Washington then over the Cascade Range toward Spokane. By June 30, 1881, the western branch reached the city. The connection to the east completed September 8, 1883. The railroad facilitated major European settlement, by bringing people, supplying locally unavailable consumer goods, and carrying local products of mining, farming, and lumbering to market.Kensel (1971), p. 23 The city of Spokane Falls officially incorporated as a city of about 1,000 residents on November 29, 1881.Durham (1912), p. 362 Robert W. Forrest was elected as the first mayor of the city, with a Council of seven - S. G. Havermale, A. M. Cannon, Dr. L. H. Whitehouse, L. W. Rima, F. R. Moore, George A. Davis, and W. C. Gray, all serving without pay. James N. Glover, second mayor, is considered the founder and \\"Father of Spokane\\".Durham (1912), p. 362–363 The small population increased rapidly, streets were built, and the small settlement became a city. The city's population grew from 4,130 to 8,891 between 1881 and 1885 and wrested the county seat from Cheney in the 1886 elections. The city's population ballooned to 19,922 in 1890.Schmeltzer (1988), pp. 44 The Great Fire The makeshift Daily Chronicle office after The Great Fire Spokane's growth continued unabated until August 4, 1889, when a fire, now known as The Great Fire (not to be confused with the Great Fire of 1910, which happened nearby), began just after 6:00 p.m. and destroyed the city's downtown commercial district. Due to technical problems with a pump station, there was no water pressure in the city when the fire started.Schmeltzer (1988), pp. 42–43 In a desperate bid to starve the fire, firefighters began razing buildings with dynamite. Eventually the winds and the fire died down; 32 blocks of Spokane's downtown core had been destroyed and one person killed. 1890–1915=Rebuilding After the devastation of the fire, Spokane experienced a building boom, financed in large part by real estate investments from Dutch bankers.Stratton (2005), p. 33, p. 200 In 1883, Herman A. Van Valkenburg, a Dutch businessman, came to Spokane to appraise railroad investments, and in 1885, formed the Northwestern and Pacific Mortgage Company. The company was reorganized in The Netherlands as the Northwestern and Pacific Hypotheekbank on June 4, 1889. The company rebuilt the downtown Spokane with granite and brick to replace destroyed wooden buildings. By 1893, Dutch investors held one-fourth of real estate in Spokane, and continued to provide a significant contribution to Spokane's growth through the middle of the 20th century.Stratton (2005), pp. 189–191 However, following the depression of 1893, many of these Dutch bankers sold their ventures to new local investors. Monroe Street Bridge, 1911 As the downtown was rebuilt, the city reincorporated under the name \\"Spokane\\" in 1891. According to historian David H. Stratton, \\"From the late 1890s to about 1912, a great flurry of construction created a modern urban profile of office buildings, banks, department stores, hotels and other commercial institutions,\\" which stretched from the Spokane River to the site of the Northern Pacific railroad tracks below the South Hill.Creighton (2013), p.7 Yet the rebuilding and development of the city was far from smooth: between 1889 and 1896 alone, all six bridges over the Spokane River were destroyed by floods before their completion. More Railroads In 1886, Daniel Chase Corbin built his first railroad into the Spokane Valley. D. C. Corbin, brother of Austin Corbin, left home at 19 and moved steadily west building his fortune dealing in land, stage stations, freighting, and mercantile, landing in Helena, Montana about 1866. Here he branched into banking, smelting, and the mining industry. Starting in 1885, his interest turned to the Coeur d’Alene Mining District, where he invested in a mill for the Bunker Hill and Sullivan mines. A railroad to quickly connect the mines and mill to markets was evident and Corbin beat various competitors to completing one. In 1886, with his son, Austin Corbin, he began two lines, the Spokane Falls & Idaho, connector to Northern Pacific, and the Coeur d'Alene Railway and Navigation Company, between Coeur d’Alene and the Silver Valley. In 1888, he sold the Coeur d’Alene line to Northern Pacific, and started the Spokane Falls and Northern Railway in 1889, from Spokane to Northport. He added subsidiaries: the Nelson and Fort Sheppard in 1891, the Columbia and Red Mountain Railway in 1895, the Eastern British Columbia Railway, and the Spokane International Railroad in 1906, connecting to the Canadian Pacific Railway, with its connections to Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. In 1888, the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company extended a line from the south, connecting Spokane to Portland, Pasco, and Walla Walla. It was bought out by Union Pacific Railroad which connected the line to their transcontinental rail system to the south. Worker moving boxes at a train station, ca. 1900 Starting in 1890, the first components of Spokane and Inland Empire Railroad Company, an electrified interurban railway, began with Francis H. Cook's Spokane and Montrose Street Railway. He sold to a group headed by Jay P. Graves in 1902, who reorganized as the Spokane Traction Company, in 1903, and incorporated as the Spokane and Inland Empire Railroad Company in 1904, rebuilding with standard gauge line. Routes were extended through various areas of Spokane, including Corbin Park, Hillyard, and Lincoln Heights. Three years after the fire, in 1892, James J. Hill brought his Great Northern Railway to Spokane. He platted and named Hillyard township (annexed by Spokane in 1924) for his rail yards, machine shops, and roundhouse, because of the area's flat ground. A town was built to house railroad workers, mainly immigrant laborers working in the local yard. With the arrival of railroads and additions to the city's railroad infrastructure, Spokane became the commercial center of the Inland Northwest, as well as an important rail and shipping center because of its location between the Rocky Mountains and the Cascade Range and between mining (particularly Idaho's Silver Valley) and agricultural areas (the Palouse).Schmeltzer (1988), p. 41 Located at crossroads of four transcontinental railroads, Spokane became one of the most important rail centers in the western United States. New Immigrants The population grew to 36,848 in 1900 with the arrival of the additional railroads.Schmeltzer (1988), pp. 44 The railroads lured settlers from as far away as Finland, Germany, and England and as close as Minnesota and the Dakotas. The marketing campaigns of transportation companies with affordable fertile land to sell along their trade routes lured many settlers into the region they dubbed \\"Spokane Country\\".Kensel (1971), pp. 22–23Stratton (2005), p. 33 The city also developed a sizable Asian community, centered in a district called Chinatown. As in many western railway towns, the Asian community started off as an encampment for migrant laborers, mostly Chinese, working on the railroads. Initially, these workers came without their families, and the district gained an unsavory reputation. By about 1900, the community was improving as more immigrants families, especially Japanese families, moved in.Stratton (2005), p. 32 By 1910, the population hit 104,000. These railroads made Spokane a transportation hub for the Inland Northwest region. The railroads connected Spokane to major commerce centers on the east and west coast, as well as in Canada, and allowed Spokane to eclipse Walla Walla as the commercial center of the Inland Northwest. In time the city came to be known as the \\"capital\\" of the Inland Empire and the heart of a vast tributary region.Stratton (2005), p. 28Malone (1996), p. 201 Mining Spokane Falls, 1890 In 1883, with the discovery of gold, silver, and lead in the Coeur d'Alene region,Stratton (2005), p. 28 mining emerged as a major stimulus to Spokane and the city served as a popular outfitting and jumping-off point for miners. The discovery of gold, silver, and lead in the Coeur d'Alene region (which generally encompasses present-day Stevens, Ferry, and Pend Oreille counties and northern Idaho) in the 1880s precipitated a rush of prospectors into the region. The Inland Empire erupted with numerous mining rushes from 1883 to the late 19th century.Kensel (1969), pp. 88-89 In the 1890s the city was subject to intrastate migration by African-Americans from Roslyn, looking for work after the closure of the area's mines. Two African-American churches, Calvary Baptist and Bethel African Methodist Episcopal, were founded in 1890.Williamson (2010), p.7 Spokane became home to many entrepreneurs, companies and managers as well as the place to finance mining and other business operations.Kensel (1969), pp. 84–85 As a regional shipping center, the city furnished supplies to the miners who passed through on their way to mine in the Coeur d’Alene region. At the onset of the initial 1883 gold rush near Coeur d'Alene, Spokane became the outfitter of choice among prospectors due to the areas lower prices and convenience of being able to obtain everything \\"from a horse to a frying pan\\".Kensel (1969), p. 85. According to the Spokane Falls Review December 1, 1883 edition. It would keep this status for subsequent rushes in the region due to its trade center status and accessibility to railroad infrastructure.Kensel (1969), pp. 85–89 During the mining boom, Spokane had its own stock exchange, the Spokane Stock Exchange, which began trading mining shares on January 18, 1897. The exchange originally consisted of 32 members and listed 37 stocks of mines across northeastern Washington, northern Idaho and southern British Columbia. Today, the Spokane area is still considered one of the most productive mining districts in North America. Emergence of logging and milling The Schade Brewery After mining declined at the turn of the 20th century, agriculture and logging became the primary influences in the Spokane economy.Kensel (1968), p. 25 The lumber industry in Spokane began with the city's founding in 1871 when Downing and Scranton built Spokane's first business, a sawmill. When it became widely known after a United States Geological Survey done in the 1890s that there were large quantities of white pine, a highly prized softwood, in the Coeur d'Alene Mountains, the lumber industry from the Eastern United States began to inventory the timberlands, acquire land and invest in facilities across much of North Idaho.Singletary p. 27 As with the mining industry, the lumber industry in the city contributed to the economy by the means of outfitting the lumberjacks and millmen working in the hundreds of mills along the railroads, rivers, and lakes of northern Washington and Idaho.Kensel (1968) p. 31 The population explosion and the building of homes, railroads, and mines in northern Idaho and southern British Columbia fueled the industry. Before the construction of the railroads that connected the region, Spokane's lumber supply was largely imported from North Idaho, especially St. Maries, Idaho; lumber would be rafted 25 miles north on the St. Joe River and Lake Coeur d'Alene and then rafted down to Spokane's mills via the Spokane River.Kensel p. 25–26 In Idaho, lumber production reached its height in the late 1910s and 1920s; in 1925 there were seven lumber mills operating in the area that were producing 500 million board feet of lumber.Singletary p.79, p. 93 Although overshadowed in importance by the vast timbered areas on the coastal regions west of the Cascades, and burdened with monopolistic rail freight rates and stiff competition, Spokane became a noted leader in the manufacture of doors, window sashes, blinds, and other planing mill products.Kensel (1968), pp. 28–29, 31 During this period, railroad companies charged what many believed were unfair shipping rates on goods going into Spokane. These rates were much higher than rates to coastal seaport cities such as Seattle and Portland; so much so that Minneapolis merchants could ship goods first to Seattle and then back to Spokane for less than shipping directly to Spokane, even though the rail line ran through Spokane on the way to the coast.Durham (1912), p. 598 This had a significant impact on the local economy, with many merchants simply choosing not to do business in Spokane. In 1892, the Interstate Commerce Commission agreed with the city after it filed a complaint about these practices, but that decision was struck down by a federal court. In 1906, Spokane sued under the newly passed Hepburn Act, and won on July 24, 1911.Durham (1912), pp. 599–603 Due to these shipping rates, no alternative transport for their shipments, the lack of a seaport, and access to international markets, Spokane never became a prominent leader in the production of lumber. The city became noted for processing and distributing dairy and orchard products and for producing products milled from timber. The Spokane area is a major center for the timber and agriculture in the Inland Northwest region. By the early twentieth century Spokane was primarily a commercial center rather than an industrial center.Kensel (1969), p. 91 Emergence of agribusiness The fertile rolling hills of the Palouse viewed from Steptoe Butte The Inland Northwest region has also long been associated with farming, especially wheat production where it is one of the largest wheat producing regions in the United States.Stratton (2005), p. 119 Initially, the Palouse region to the south of Spokane was thought to be not suited for wheat production due to the hilly terrain, believing wheat could not be cultivated on the tops of the hills, but the region showed great promise for wheat production when it began in the late 1850s in part due to the hilltops. Agricultural potential and productivity depends greatly on a region's soil qualities which in turn is dependent on the climate and amount and timing of rainfall events.Stratton (2005), p. 120 The Inland Empire, with its cool, snowy and rainy winters, rainy spring, and hot and dry summers lends itself to a wide variety of farming.Stratton (2005), p. 121 The commercial farming activities were greatly enhanced by the founding of two state land- grant universities, Washington State University (as the Agriculture College, Experiment Station and School of Science of the State of Washington) in Pullman and the University of Idaho eight miles away in Moscow, Idaho.Stratton (2005), p. 128 The strategically placed universities and their experiment stations and staff would help the industry by improving farm management, conducting research, and teaching students to be better, more competent farmers. Industry innovators such as William Jasper Spillman (1863-1931) and later Orville Vogel (1907-1991) and others would make significant contributions and observations to the widen the knowledge of agriculture, horticulture and farm management and animal science with applications for the region and around the world.Stratton (2005), pp. 128-129, 134 \\"Spokane Country\\" was a breadbasket. As marketed by the Spokane Chamber of Commerce in 1907, it was defined as the area between the Cascades and Rocky Mountains, British Columbia and the Blue Mountains. It's agribusiness developed and grew with the completion of the railroad networks and highway system that centered around the city, which aided farmers around the region in distributing their products to market at low cost.Stratton (2005), pp. 126-127 The growth of the Inland Northwest's rural counties also was the result of the governmental and private efforts to irrigate and develop farmlands in the region. These programs, especially the Big Bend Project, resulted in an estimated 2,000,000 acres of arable farmland worth an estimated value of $50,000,000 in 1920.Spokane Chamber of Commerce, c. 1920.Tourist’s Guide to Spokane and Environs. Pacific Northwest Collections, University of Washington Libraries. Spokane, Washington: Chamber of Commerce. pp. 2-3. The gravelly Spokane Valley, immediately to the east of Spokane, was not a good candidate for wheat, but instead developed extensive fruit orchards. By 1922, there were more than 1.6 million apple trees planted in the Valley and huge packing plants built. As with mining in the late 1880s, Spokane was an important agricultural market and supply center. Inland Empire farmers exported wheat, fruit, livestock, and other agricultural products to ports such as New York, Liverpool and Tokyo through the Spokane rail and highway infrastructure.Stratton (2005), p. 127 Wayne D. Rasmussen notes the U.S. Works Progress Administration showed in 1940, \\"3 flour mills, 5 meat packing plants, 23 creameries, 17 bakeries, and 6 poultry plants\\" as well as 300 factories operating in the city.Stratton (2005), p. 132 Free speech fight The Little Red Songbook and The Industrial Worker began publication in Spokane in 1909. During this time of stagnation, unrest was prevalent among the area's unemployed, who became victimized by \\"job sharks\\", who charged a fee for signing up workers in the logging camps. Job sharks and employment agencies were known to cheat itinerant workers, sometimes paying bribes to periodically fire entire work crews, thus generating repetitive fees for themselves. Crime spiked in the 1890s and 1900s,Stratton (2005), pp. 148–151Kienholz (1999), p. 209–210 with eruptions of violent activity involving unions such as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), or \\"Wobblies\\" as they were often known, whose free speech fights had begun to garner national attention.Stratton (2005), p. 152 Now, with grievances concerning the unethical practices of the employment agencies, they initiated a free speech fight in September 1908 by purposely breaking a city ordinance on soapboxing. With IWW encouragement, union members from many western states came to Spokane to take part in what had become a publicity stunt. Many Wobblies were incarcerated, including feminist labor leader Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, who published her account in the local Industrial Worker. First celebration of Father's Day Spokane is known as the birthplace of the national movement started by Sonora Smart Dodd that led to the proposal and eventual establishment of Father's Day as a national holiday in the U.S.Schmidt (1995), pp. 275–276 The first observation of Father's Day in Spokane was on June 19, 1910. Sonora conceived the idea in Spokane's Central Methodist Episcopal Church while listening to a Mother's Day sermon.Schmidt (1995), p. 276 1915–1990=Growth and stagnation W.P. Fuller and Co. Warehouse, built 1915 Spokane continued to grow rapidly through the early 20th century. By 1900, the population had reached 36,848, and by 1910 had more than tripled, to 104,402.\\"City's Population for 1920 104,204.\\" Spokane Press. May 7, 1920. The expansion and growth of Spokane abruptly stopped in the 1910s and was followed by a period of population decline.Stratton (2005), p. 35 This growth pattern continued until 1917, when the population reached 150,323.Spokane City Directory: 1917. Joel E. Ferris Archive, Northwest Museum of Arts & Culture. Spokane, Washington. Spokane's slowing economy largely contributed to this decline. Control of regional mines and resources became increasingly dominated by national corporations rather than locals, diverting capital outside of Spokane and decreasing growth and investment opportunities in the city. At the turn of the 20th century, much of the Inland Empire's mining districts were sold to outside interests due to the regions' insufficient capital to fully exploit the mines potential.Kensel (1969), p. 96 Local morale was also affected for years by the collapse of the Division Street Bridge early in the morning on December 15, 1915, which killed five people and injured over 20, but a new bridge was built (eventually replaced in 1994).Creighton (2013), p.82 The 1920 census showed a net increase of just 35 individuals, which actually indicates that thousands left the city when considering the natural growth rate of a population. The 1920s and 1930s saw the similar, but less drastic slow growth of the 1910s, and this change of outlook forced city boosters to market the city as a quiet, comfortable place suitable for raising a family rather than a dynamic community full of opportunity.Stratton (2005), p. 35–36 The Inland Northwest region was heavily dependent on extractive products produced from farms, forests, and mines which experienced a fall in demand.Stratton (2005), p. 38 In Coeur d'Alene the Depression years saw a decline in lumber demand and by the mid 1930s about half the woodworkers in northern Idaho were laid off and the surviving mills were producing only 160 million board feet of lumber per year.Singletary p. 93 Spokane's situation improved with the start of World War II when aluminum production initiated in the Spokane valley due to the areas inexpensive electricity (produced from regional dams) and the increased demand for airplanes. The two aluminum plants, the Mead Works reduction plant and Trentwood Works rolling mill brought thousands of heavy industry manufacturing jobs to the Spokane area and supplied the materials to make landing craft for use in the Pacific Theater. After the war, Kaiser Aluminum leased the facilities in 1946 and eventually purchased them in 1958. 1960s and 1970s: Revitalization efforts The distinctive sign and building top of The Parkade After decades of slow growth, Spokane businessmen headed by King Cole formed Spokane Unlimited, an organization that sought to revitalize downtown Spokane.Stratton (2005), pp. 211–212 Early but modest success came in the form of a new parking garage in 1965, The Parkade. Soon, focus to revitalize the economy focused on improving Havermale Island, which was dominated by railroad depots and warehouses. A recreation park that would showcase the Spokane falls was the preferred option, and the organization successfully negotiated freeing up the island property and relocating the rail lines. In the early 1970s, Spokane was approaching its one-hundredth birthday, and Spokane Unlimited hired a private firm to start preparations for a celebration and fair.Stratton (2005), p. 215 In a report delivered by the firm, the proposal of a world's fair was introduced, which culminated in Expo '74. =1974 World's Fair= The 1974 World's Fair U.S. Pavilion Spokane hosted the first environmentally themed World's Fair in Expo '74, becoming the then-smallest city to ever host a World's Fair.Stratton (2005), p. 207 Expo '74 also had the distinction of being the first American fair after World War II to be attended by the Soviet Union. This event transformed Spokane's downtown, removing a century of railroad industry that built the city and reinventing the urban core. The Spokane clock tower was once part of a Great Northern Railway depot that once occupied the site. Upon close inspection, it can be seen where bricks were added on and where the roof used to be. The clock tower is one of the biggest in the Northwest, with each of its clock faces measuring 9 feet (2.7 m) across. Many of the structures built for the World's Fair are still standing and in use. The United States Pavilion sits next to an IMAX theater, and the Washington State Pavilion became the First Interstate Center for the Arts. The Expo site itself, located on Havermale Island, became the Riverfront Park, containing, among other features, the U.S. Pavilion, the turn-of-the-20th- century Riverfront Park Looff Carousel, and the Great Northern Railway clock tower, the last remnant of the rail depot that was demolished for Expo '74. The U.S. Pavilion and the clock tower are prominently featured in the park's logo. At this time, the Chinatown district was slated for demolition as well. The Chinatown Asian community thrived until the 1940s, after which its population decreased and became integrated and dispersed, losing its Asian character; urban blight and the preparations leading up to Expo '74 led to Chinatown's eventual demolition. The late 1970s was a period of growth for Spokane which led to the construction in the early 1980s of the two tallest buildings in the city, the 18-story Farm Credit Banks Building and the 20-story Seafirst Financial Center, now the Bank of America building.Schmeltzer (1988), p. 85 1980s: Recession and diversification The success seen in the late 1970s and early 1980s once again was interrupted by another U.S. recession in which silver, timber, and farm prices dropped.Schmeltzer (1988), p. 87 The period of decline for the city lasted into the 1990s and was also marked by a loss of many steady family-wage jobs in the manufacturing sector. In the 1990s, market forces began to impact Kaiser and layoffs, pension cuts, a 1998-1999 labor strike, and eventually bankruptcy in 2002 followed. Although a tough period, Spokane's economy had begun to benefit from economic diversification, being the home to growing companies such as Key Tronic and having research, marketing, and assembly plants for other technology companies helped lessen Spokane's dependency on natural resources. 21st century Spokane has an extensive skywalk network Spokane is still trying to make the transition to a more service-oriented economy in the face of a less prominent manufacturing sector. Developing the city's strength in the medical and health sciences fields has seen some success, resulting in the expansion of the University District with a University of Washington and Washington State University medical school branches. The city faces challenges such as a scarcity of high-paying jobs, pockets of poverty, and areas of high crime. The opening of the River Park Square Mall in 1999 sparked a downtown rebirth that included the building of the Spokane Arena and expansion of the Spokane Convention Center.Spirou (2010), p. 210 Other major projects include the building of the Big Easy concert house (now the Knitting Factory) and renovation of the historic Montvale Hotel, the Kirtland Cutter-designed Davenport Hotel (after being vacant for over 20 years), and the Fox Theater (now home to the Spokane Symphony) as well as the completion of the WSU Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences Building in 2013 and the Davenport Grand Hotel in 2015 and the ongoing renovation of Riverfront Park. The Kendall Yards development on the west side of downtown Spokane is one of the largest construction projects in the city's history. Directly across the Spokane River from downtown, it will blend residential and retail space with plazas and walking trails.

It is unknown when the present meaning of the word, \\"Sun People\\" replaced this earlier meaning. Unbeknownst to them, the Spokane Valley was the only area within 200 miles that could provide passage to the Inland Empire through the Rockies at a reasonable grade. The present name, set forth by an 1891 charter reincorporated the city under the name Spokane Falls, stating: \\"The corporate name of the city is Spokane Falls, and by that name shall have perpetual succession,\\" (Charter, Article I). However, a later article in that same charter, voted on concurrently, changed the name to Spokane. Secretary of the Spokane chamber of commerce, John R. Reavis tells of Spokane's significance to the Inland Northwest region as a distributing center (largely the city's raison d'être) in his 1891 Annual Report, writing: \\"By reason of her geographical position and railroad connections Spokane is fitted as no other city is, or ever can be, to be the distributing center of all that country within a radius of 150 miles, and in some instances territory much farther away. There is no point 150 miles from Spokane that is not at least 225 miles from any other city of 10,000 population. We have about us a territory of 60,000 square miles in extent, to every point of which we are nearer than any other city, to every point of which we have better railroad connections and easier grades than any other city ... We have eight lines of railroad that radiate out in all directions through it, so that shipments made here in the morning can reach any point within its borders by nightfall. We have a telephone system connecting us with almost every shipping town and shipping station within its borders. Goods may be ordered, shipped and received, in most instances, within one day. Never was a city more intimately knit to its surrounding territory than Spokane, and never was one more free from a legitimate rival in trade ...\\"Reavis, John R. (1892).

Knight Co. pp. 6–7, 10–12. The financing for rebuilding the downtown core came in large part from the infusion of investment from Dutch bankers; this investment was so deep that by 1896, one prominent Dutch mortgage company, the Northwestern and Pacific Hypotheekbank owned a quarter of the city. In 1892, the Interstate Commerce Commission agreed with the city after it filed a complaint about these practices, but that decision was struck down by a federal court. In 1906, Spokane sued under the newly passed Hepburn Act, and won on July 24, 1911.Durham (1912), pp. 599–603 References Bibliography       * *  External links * City - County of Spokane Historic Preservation Office * Spokane Historical, A public history program at Eastern Washington University * Historylink.org, Online encyclopedia of Washington state history ","title":"History of Spokane, Washington"},{"id":"12721732","text":"The CAMS 55 was a reconnaissance flying boat built in France in the late 1920s which equipped the French Navy throughout the 1930s.

The cockpit was open, and there were open gun positions in the bow and amidships. The bow also incorporated an observation balcony with windows sloped to afford a good downward view.Taylor 1986, p. 226. Operational history A single prototype was followed by two aircraft to compare different engine installations, one with air-cooled radials and the other a liquid-cooled V engine; in the end, the French Navy ordered some of each. Eventually, 15 escadrilles were equipped with CAMS 55s of various subtypes, replacing the Latham 47 in some units, and in turn being relegated to secondary duties when the Breguet Bizerte became available in 1936.

The first engagement was in May 1644, during which King Charles I escaped, thus preventing a formal siege. The second, in May 1645, had barely started when Sir Thomas Fairfax was given orders to stop and pursue the King to Naseby instead. The last siege began in May 1646 and was a formal siege of two months; but the war was obviously over and negotiation, rather than fighting, took precedence. Being careful not to inflict too much damage on the city, Fairfax even sent in food to the King's second son, James, and was happy to conclude the siege with an honourable agreement before any further escalation occurred.  Oxford during the civil war  The creation of the King's Oxford Parliament in January 1644 placed Oxford at the centre of the Cavalier cause and the city became the headquarters of the King's forces. This had advantages and disadvantages for both parties; although the majority of citizens supported the Roundheads, supplying the Royalist court and garrison gave them financial opportunities. The location of Oxford gave the King the strategic advantage in controlling the Midland counties but the disadvantages of the city became increasingly manifest. Despite this, any proposals to retreat to the southwest were silenced, particularly by those enjoying the comforts of university accommodation. The King was at Christ Church and the Queen at Merton. The executive committee of the Privy Council met at Oriel; St John's housed the French ambassador and the two Palatine princes Rupert and Maurice; All Souls, New College, and St Mary's College housed respectively the arsenal, the magazine and an ordnance factory; while the mills in Osney became a powder factory. At New Inn Hall, the requisitioned college plate was melted down into 'Oxford Crowns', and at Carfax, there was a gibbet. University life continued, although somewhat restricted and disturbed; the future kings Charles II and James II were given Master of Arts degrees, as were many others for non-academic reasons. Throughout, both sides employed poor strategies and suffered from weak intelligence, and there was less animosity between the sides than is usual in such wars.  First siege (1644)  On the left and upper left, the River Cherwell, Magdalen Bridge (East Bridge), and Christ Church Meadow (Christ Church walks) are marked on Wenceslaus Hollar's map of Oxford. Headington Hill and Marston are off the left hand side of the map. Late in May 1644 Edmund Ludlow joined Sir William Waller at Abingdon to blockade Oxford. According to Sir Edward Walker's diary, on 27 May Waller attempted to cross the Isis at Newbridge, but was defeated by Royalist dragoons. The following day, the Earl of Essex Robert Devereaux and his army forded the river at Sandford-on-Thames, halting on Bullingdon Green in full view of the city. Whilst the main army marched on to Islip to make quarters there, the Earl of Essex and a small party of horse came within cannon shot to make a closer inspection of the place. For a large part of 29 May, various parties of Parliamentarian horse troop went up and down Headington Hill and had a few skirmishes near the ports, although little damage was made on either side--the work at St Clement's Port made three or four great shot at them, driving them back to the main body of troops. The King, being at that time on the top of Magdalen Tower, had a clear view of the troops' manoeuvres. On 30 May and 31 May the Parliamentarians made unsuccessful attempts to cross the River Cherwell at Gosford Bridge, and Earl of Cleveland Thomas Wentworth made a demonstration with 150 horse troops towards Abingdon, where Waller had 1,000 foot and 400 horse troops. Entering the town, Cleveland captured forty prisoners, but was pursued so heavily they escaped, and although he killed the commander of their party, the Royalists lost Captains de Lyne and Trist, with many more wounded. Waller finally succeeded in forcing the passage at Newbridge on 2 June and a large contingent crossed the Isis in boats. The King went to Woodstock to hold council and in the late evening heard news that Waller had brought some 5,000 horse and foot through Newbridge, some of which were within three miles of Woodstock. Islip and the passes over the Cherwell were abandoned, leaving matches burning at the bridges to deceive the Parliamentarians, the Royalists retreated to Oxford, arriving there in the early morning of 3 June. Walker notes that there was not enough supplies to last fourteen days and that if the army stayed in the city and were besieged, all would be lost in a matter of days. It was decided the King should leave Oxford that night: the King ordered a large part of the army, with cannon, to march through the city towards Abingdon to act as a diversion. The King constituted a council to govern affairs in his absence and ordered all others who were to join him to be ready at the sound of a trumpet. After a few hours the army returned from Abingdon, having successfully drawn off Waller. On the night of 3 June 1644 at about 9 p.m. the King and Prince Charles, accompanied by various Lords and a party of 2,500 musketeers, joined the body of horse, taking the van which then marched to Wolvercote and on to Yarnton towards Long Hanborough, Northleigh and Burford, which they reached at about 4 p.m. on 4 June. The army's Colours had been left standing and a further diversion was arranged by the 3,500 infantry left with the cannon in North Oxford. The Earl of Essex and his troops had crossed the River Cherwell and had some troops in Woodstock, while Waller and his forces were between Newbridge and Eynsham. Although without heavy baggage, the King had some sixty to seventy carriages, a large troop to have got through undiscovered. The parliamentarian scouting was seriously at fault, unaided by the lack of co-operation between Essex and Waller, it led to a disgraceful inability on the part of two large armies to counter the escape of the King. The escape being discovered, Waller made haste in pursuit, taking some few stragglers in Burford who had \\"regarded their drink more than their safety\\". The King and his forces, after assembling in the fields beyond Bourton, continued to march on to Worcester. A letter from Lord Digby to Prince Rupert dated 17 June 1644, gives an indication of the immensity of the lost opportunities; > The truth of it is, had Essex and Waller jointly either pursued us or > attacked Oxford, we had been lost. In the one course Oxford had been yielded > up to them, having not a fortnight's provisions, and no hopes of relief. In > the other Worcester had been lost, and the King forced to retreat to your > Highness. Following the unproductive efforts by Essex and Waller to capture Oxford and the King, Sergeant-Major General Browne was appointed command of Parliamentarian forces on 8 June, with orders for the reduction of Oxford, Wallingford, Banbury, and the Fort of Greenland House. Browne was also to select and preside over a council of war of twelve men, and although he greatly troubled Oxford from then on, there were no further attempts on the city during the 1644 campaign season.  Second siege (1645)  In the New Year, one of the first objectives of the New Model Army was the blockade and siege of Oxford, initially intending that Oliver Cromwell and Browne go to Oxford, while Fairfax marched to the west. Fairfax was in Reading on 30 April 1645 and by 4 May had reached Andover, where he received orders to prevent Prince Rupert getting to Oxford. On 6 May Fairfax was ordered to join Cromwell and Browne at Oxford and to send 3,000 foot soldiers and 1,500 horse soldiers to relieve Taunton, which he accomplished on 12 May. The Committee had ordered a voluntary contribution from Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Berkshire to raise forces to take Oxford and on 17 May planned for funding Fairfax in the reducing of Oxford, so that \\"it may prevent all Provisions and Ammunition to be brought in\\". On 19 May Fairfax arrived in Cowley and made his way over Bullingdon Green and on to Marston, showing himself on Headington Hill. On the 22 May he began the siege by raising a breastwork on the east side of the River Cherwell and erecting a bridge at Marston. On 23 May the House of Commons gave the Committee of the Army orders to \\"make Provision for such Money and Necessaries for the Siege of Oxon, as they have or shall Receive directions for from the Committee of Both Kingdoms, not exceeding the Sum of Six thousand Pounds\\", having already agreed that £10,000 was to await Fairfax at Windsor, along with the following provision for a siege: According to Sir William Dugdale's diary, on 23 May Fairfax was at Marston and his troops began crossing the river, the outhouses of Godstow House were fired, causing the occupants to evacuate to Oxford, and the house occupied by the Parliamentarians. On 26 May Fairfax put four regiments of foot soldiers with thirteen carriages by the newly erected bridge at Marston, the King's forces 'drowned' the meadow, fired houses in the suburbs and placed a garrison at Wolvercote. Whilst viewing the ongoing works, Fairfax had a narrow escape from being shot. On the following day two of Fairfax's regiments--the white and the red--with two pieces of ordnance marched to Godstow House and on to Hinksey. The Auxiliaries on duty in Oxford; the Lord Keeper, the Lord Treasurer, and the Mayor of Oxford marched before their Companies to the Guards. In the evening of 29 May a \\"bullet of ix lb. weight, shot from the Rebels warning piece at Marston, fell against the wall on the north side of the Hall in Christ Church\\". Meanwhile Gaunt House near Newbridge was under siege by Colonel Thomas Rainsborough with 600 foot soldiers and 200 horse. Next day the sound of firing at Gaunt House could be heard in Oxford and the following day Rainsborough took the house and 50 prisoners. In the early hours of the morning on 2 June the troops in Oxford made a sally and a party of foot and horse attacked the Parliamentarian Guard at Headington Hill, killing 50 and taking 96 prisoners, many seriously wounded. In the afternoon Parliamentarian forces drove off 50 cattle grazing in fields outside the East Gate. On 3 June the prisoners taken the day before were exchanged and the following day the siege was raised and the bridge over the River Cherwell was demolished. The Parliamentarian forces withdrew the troops from Botley and Hinksey, and also withdrew from their headquarters at Marston and on 5 June they completed evacuating Marston and Wolvercote. The reason for such a sudden withdrawal was that the King, Prince Rupert, Prince Maurice, and the Earl of Lindsey, Montagu Bertie and others had left Oxford on 7 May. In the meantime, Fairfax, who disliked spending time in siege warfare, had prevailed upon the Committee to allow him to lift the siege and follow the King. A letter by Fairfax to his father dated 4 June 1645 explains: > I am very sorry we should spend our time unprofitably before a town, whilst > the King hath time to strengthen himself, and by terror to force obedience > of all places where he comes; the Parliament is sensible of this now, > therefore hath sent me directions to raise the siege and march to > Buckingham, where, I believe, I shall have orders to advance northwards, in > such a course as all our divided parties may join. It is the earnest desire > of this Army to follow the King, but the endeavours of others prevent it > hath so much prevailed. On 5 June, Fairfax abandoned the siege, having received orders to engage the King and recapture Leicester instead.  Third siege (1646)  The King returned to Oxford on 5 November 1645 to quarter for the winter. The Royalists planned to resume the campaign in the spring and sent Lord Astley to Worcester to collect a force from Wales. However, on the journey back his troops were routed at Stow-on-the-Wold by Parliamentarian forces under the command of Sir William Brereton, and Astley and his officers were taken prisoner. Two letters from the King to the Queen are of note; the first, dated 6 April 1646 advised her that he was expecting to be received into the Scots army, the second letter of his is dated 22 April stated: \\"I resolved from hence to venture breaking thro' the rebells' quarters (which, upon my word, was neither a safe nor an easy work) to meet them where they should appoint; and I was so eager upon it, that, had it not been for Pr. Rupert's backwardness, I had tryed it without hearing from them, being impatient of delay\\" and that the King intended to travel in disguise to Lynn and on to Montrose by sea. The committee in London again ordered its forces to 'straiten' Oxford. On 18 March there was a skirmish between the Oxford Horse and troops commanded by Colonel Charles Fleetwood, and 2,000 Parliamentarians under the command of Rainsborough came into Woodstock from Witney. On 30 March Rainsborough's foot soldiers and all four of Fairfax's horse regiments were ordered to \\"such places as will wholly block up Oxford\\" and make the inhabitants \\"presently to live at the expense of their Stores\\". On 3 April Browne, the Governor of Abingdon, was ordered to send fifty barrels of gunpowder to Rainsborough. On 4 April Colonel Henry Ireton was given orders by Fairfax to join those forces assembling for the 'straitening' of Oxford. On 10 April the House of Commons referred to the Committee to \\"take some course for the stricter Blocking up of Oxon, and guarding the Passes between Oxon and the Cities of London and Westminster\\", the Committee was directed to draw up a general summons to ask the King's garrisons to surrender under a penalty for refusal. On 15 April the sound of cannon firing against Woodstock Manor House could be heard in Oxford, and at about 6 p.m. Rainsborough's troops attacked but were beaten back, losing 100 men, their scaling ladders were taken and many others wounded. On 26 April the Manor House was surrendered, its Governor and his soldiers, without their weapons, returned to Oxford in the evening. The King left the city early in the morning of 27 April without disclosing his destination to those privy to his departure; There are two letters from Colonel Payne, commander of the garrison in Abingdon, to Browne--one dated 27 April reporting intelligence that the King went in disguise to London, making use of Fairfax's seal that had been duplicated by them in Oxford; the other is dated 29 April noting the common reports of the King's flight: On 30 April the House of Commons, having heard of the King's flight the previous day, issued orders that no person was to be allowed \\"out of Oxford, by pass or otherwise, except it be upon parley or treaty, concerning the surrendering of the garrison, of some fort, or otherwise advantageous, for reducing of the garrison\\". On 1 May, Fairfax returned to Oxford to place the city under siege, as had been expected. On 2 May Parliamentarian soldiers entered the villages around Oxford, such as Headington and Marston, following a general rendezvous of the army at Bullingdon Green. On 3 May the Parliamentarians held a council of war where it was decided that a \\"Quarter\\" on Headington Hill should be made to hold 3,000 men, it was also decided to build a bridge over the River Cherwell at Marston. The General's regiment and that of Colonel Pickering were to be stationed at Headington, the Major General's and Colonel Harley's at Marston, Colonel Thomas Herbert's, and Colonel Sir Hardress Waller's Regiments at Cowley, whilst the train of artillery was placed at Elsfield, a fourth quarter was made on the north side of Oxford, where most of the foot troops were assembled to enable approaches across ground near to the city walls. Meanwhile the towns of Faringdon, Radcot, Wallingford and Boarstall House were completely blockaded. Within cannon shot from the city, Fairfax's men began to construct a line from the 'Great Fort' on Headington Hill towards St Clement's, lying outside Magdalen Bridge. On 6 May the magazine for provisions in Oxford was opened and from then on 4,700 were fed from it, \\"being more by 1,500, as 'twas thought, than upon a true muster the soldiers were\\". On 11 May Fairfax sent in a demand of surrender to the Governor: That afternoon, Prince Rupert was wounded for the first time, being shot in the upper arm whilst on a raiding party in the fields to the North of Oxford. On 13 May the first shot was fired from the 'Great Fort' on Headington Hill, the shot falling in Christ Church Meadow. The Governor, Sir Thomas Glemham, and the officers of the garrison of Oxford gave the opinion to the Lords of the Privy Council that the city was defensible. On 14 May the Governor of Oxford, under direction from the Privy Council, sent a letter to Fairfax offering to treat on the Monday (18 May), asking for their commissioners to meet. Fairfax, in council of war, sent a reply the same day, agreeing to the time and naming Mr Unton Croke's house at Marston as the meeting place. The Privy Council ordered that all their books and papers of parliamentary proceedings transacted in Oxford were to be burned. On 16 May the Governor gave the Privy Council a paper requiring that the Lords \\"justify under their hands that they have regal power in the King's absence; namely, to deliver up Garrisons, levy forces and the like. Whereupon the Lords signed a paper whereby they challenged the like power\\". On 17 May the Governor and all his principal officers of the garrison signed a paper \\"manifesting their dislike in opinion of the present Treaty\\", and alleged it was forced upon them by the Lords of Council: This disclaimer of responsibility did little to delay the progress of the Treaty, the civilians, with a better sense of the situation, thought that delay \\"might be of ill consequence\\". The same day the Governor sent his acceptance and names of his commissioners to Fairfax; Sir John Monson, Sir John Heydon, Sir Thomas Gardiner, Sir George Binyon, Sir Richard Willis, Sir Stephen Hawkyns, Colonels Robert Gosnold and Henry Tillier, Richard Zouch, Thomas Chicheley, John Dutton, Geoffrey Palmer, Philip Warwick, and Captain Robert Mead. Fairfax, in return sent the names of his commissioners; Thomas Hammond, Henry Ireton, Colonels John Lambert, Charles Rich and Robert Harley, Leonard Watson, Majors John Desborough and Thomas Harrison, Thomas Herbert and Hardress Waller; later, the names of Henry Boulstred, John Mills and Matthew Hale were added.  Treaty  Some discussion followed about it being usual at all treaties to appoint secretaries, to which Fairfax agreed; the Oxford commissioners were to bring Henry Davidson as their secretary, the Parliamentarians would bring William Clark. The first session took place at Croke's house on 18 May, as originally agreed. A letter from N.T. (whose identity is unknown) in Marston on 20 May complains about the 'lumbering at Oxford' and the procrastination of the Oxford commissioners; the letter concludes: A first draft of the articles was referred by Fairfax to the House of Commons, presented by Colonel Rich on 22 May. The Journals of the House record that the House did \\"upon the very first view of them, disdain those Articles and overtures offered by those at Oxon\\" and left Fairfax to \\"proceed effectually, according to the trust reposed in him, for the speedy gaining and reducing the garrison of Oxon to the obedience of the Parliament\\". On 23 May the commissioners returned to Marston and according to Dugdale's diary \\"the adverse party pretended our Articles to be too high, said they would offer Articles, and so the Treaty broke off at the time\\". On 25 May a Committee of nine Lords and nine of the Commons was constituted to consider honourable conditions for Oxford's surrender. A conference of both Houses met upon a letter from the King, written from Newcastle, dated 18 May, enclosing a letter for Glemham, the debate continued into the following day. The King's letter regarding Oxford stated: On 15 June the heads of conference with the Commons viewed the King's letter of 18 May and another from the King, dated 10 June, which was similar in terms, but included an order from the King \\"directed to the Governors of Oxford, Lichfield, Worcester, Wallingford, and all other Commanders of any his Towns, Castles, and Forts within England and Wales\\". The heads of conference wanted the warrant sent to Fairfax and for him to forward it on. In the Commons it was ordered that the warrant of 10 June be sent to all Governors \\"for Preventing of the further Effusion of Christian Blood\\". Dugdale's diary for 30 May records: \\"This evening Sir Tho. Fairfax sent in a Trumpet to Oxford, with Articles concerning the delivery thereof\\". Rushworth, who was Fairfax's secretary at the time stated that Fairfax drew up the Articles; however, the Committee of the two Houses appointed on 25 May may have had a hand in them. The Treaty was renewed, the Oxford commissioners taking the stance that they submitted themselves \\"to the Fate of the Kingdom, rather than any way distrusting their own Strength, or the Garrison's Tenableness\\". The resumption of the Treaty coincided with a seemingly random exchange of cannon fire, Oxford loosing 200 shot in the day, managing to land a great shot in the Leaguer on Headington Hill, killing Colonel Cotsworth. A sutler and others were killed in Rainsborough's camp, while the Parliamentarian \\"cannon in recompense played fiercely upon the defendants, and much annoyed them in their works, houses, and colleges, till at last a cessation of great shot was agreed to on both sides\\". On 1 June Fairfax was prepared to take the city by storm if necessary. On 3 June Oxford forces made a sally from East Port, and about 100 cavalry troopers attempted drive in some cattle grazing near Cowley, but the Parliamentarian horse countered them in skirmishes, during which Captain Richardson and two more were killed. On 4 June the commissioners met again in Marston to consider the new articles offered by Fairfax. On 8 June various Oxford gentlemen delivered a paper of particulars to the Privy Council, which they wanted to add into the Treaty, asking to be informed of the proceedings and to be allowed attendance with the commissioners. On 9 June the commissioners were sworn to secrecy over the talks and forbidden to say anything about their proceedings. On 10 June Fairfax sent a present of \\"a brace of Bucks, 2 Muttons, 2 Veals, 2 Lambs, 6 Capons, and Butter\\" into Oxford for the Duke of York (James II). A letter from Fairfax to his father, dated 13 June, states: On 17 June there was a general cessation of arms and extensive fraternizing between the two armies. The Privy Council did not dare meet in the Audit House as was usual \\"in regard of the mutinous soldiers, especially reformadoes\\". The following day the clergy with others reproached the Lords of the Privy Council for the terms of the Treaty; the next day, the Lords of the Privy Council walked with swords on, fearing for their own safety. On 20 June the Articles of Surrender, including provisions for academics and citizens, were agreed upon at Water Eaton, and signed in the Audit House of Christ Church; for the first side by the Privy Council and the Governor of Oxford, and Fairfax for the other. On 21 June the Lords of the Privy Council held a meeting with the gentlemen of the town in the Audit House, at which the Lord Keeper made a speech about the need to conclude the Treaty, and read them the authority of the two letters from the King. A copy of the Moderate Intelligencer was produced, along with an account of the Scots \\"pressing the King's conscience so far that sundry times he was observed to retire and weep\\", which affected the Lord Keeper similarly. On 22 June Princes Rupert and Maurice were given permission by Fairfax to leave Oxford and go to Oatlands, to see the Elector, despite it being contrary to the terms of the Articles. The matter was debated in the House of Commons on 26 June, the Princes were commanded \\"to repair to the Sea Side, within Ten Days; and forwith to depart the Kingdom\\". Prince Rupert sent a long letter, from himself and Maurice, arguing that they did not violate the terms of the Treaty, but offered to submit if his argument failed. On 24 June, the day set for the Treaty to come into operation, the evacuation of Oxford by the Royalists began. It was not possible to withdraw the entire garrison in one day, but under Article 5 a large body of the regular garrison, some 2,000 to 3,000 men, marched out of the city with all the honours of war. Those living in North Oxford went by the North Port, and some 900 marched out over Magdalen Bridge, on to Headington Hill between the lines of the Parliamentarian troops, and on to Thame where they were disarmed and dispersed with their passes. The form of pass issued by Fairfax was: Although 2,000 passes were issued over a few days, a number of people had to wait their turn. On 25 June the keys of the City were formally handed over to Fairfax; with the larger part of the regular Oxford garrison having left the day before, he sent in three regiments of foot soldiers to maintain order. The evacuation subsequently continued in an orderly fashion, and peace returned to Oxford.

It is named after by her commander, Matthew Flinders when he explored the area in 1802. The Group lies within the Great Australian Bight. All the islands except Flinders Island, and a part of Pearson Island, are within the Investigator Group Wilderness Protection Area and the Waldegrave Islands Conservation Park. Description=Generally The Investigator Group is a group of islands and associated landforms that are located within an area extending for a distance of about south west from Cape Finniss on the west coast of Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. The group consists of the following islands and island groups placed in order of increasing distance from Cape Finniss: the Waldegrave Islands, The Watchers, Flinders Island, Topgallant Islands, the Ward Islands and the Pearson Isles. Waldgrave Islands The northernmost group lies 3 km offshore near the small town of Elliston. It consists of Waldegrave (292 ha) and Little Waldegrave (32 ha) Islands. They have calcarenite soils and were grazed by sheep until 1967. The vegetation is mainly regenerating pasture, with patches of native shrubland dominated by Native Juniper and Coast Daisy-bush. The Watchers The Watchers are a pair of rocks that are spaced about apart and which are located about west of Little Waldegrave Island. The western rock has a charted height of and is reported in another source as being . The eastern rock is charted as an intertidal reef.RAN, 1979DMH, 1985, chart 38Robinson et al., 1996, page 188 Flinders Island Flinders Island, which is 28 km offshore and at 36 km2 is the largest island in the Investigator Group. Flinders Island is leasehold land used for grazing. It has sandy, calcarenite soils, is mainly vegetated with pasture grasses, and has some remnant patches of heathland and Melaleuca woodland. Topgallant Islands Topgallant Islands are located 6 km to the east of Flinders Islands and is a small island with steep cliffs and some stunted shrubland. Ward Islands Ward Islands are located 16 km to the west of Flinders Island and is covered with shrubland and heathland. Pearson Isles The southernmost group consists of Pearson Island (213 ha), the Veteran Isles (14 ha) and Dorothee Island (56 ha). Pearson Island, the second largest of the whole Investigator Group, and containing its highest point at 231 m above sea level, is vegetated with shrub and heathland with patches of Casuarina and Melaleuca woodland. The Veteran Isles support low shrubland dominated by Twiggy Daisy-bush and Marsh Saltbush. Lying 3 km south- south-west of the Veteran Isles is Dorothee Island, the most southerly of the Investigator Group.Geoscience Australia, 1983. Topgallant 5730 1:100,000 topographic map, Edition 1.

Story Hidden deep within the Hotai forest, you'll find a family of playful and mysteriously colored creatures known as Piyos. Every spring mother Piyo, Piyomama, lays a few eggs to fill the forest with new colorful Piyos; however, this year she got too excited and laid too many! Help her hatch the eggs before they overflow the nest! Gameplay Piyotama is a puzzle game where the goal is to manipulate colored eggs and line up four or more in a row to \\"hatch\\" them. The eggs can only be manipulated when outside of the \\"nest\\" (the play area), which is accomplished by sliding the selected row of eggs to the left or right using the dpad. The order of the three eggs pushed out of the nest can be cycled left or right using the X and O buttons, respectively. The current row can be changed with the up and down directions on the dpad allowing them to be re- inserted on a different row to form lines of matching eggs. Once a line of four eggs is formed a \\"hatch\\" is begun, giving the player a short time to create more lines of eggs to form a combo to score more points before the eggs hatch. When the \\"hatch\\" timer is up any eggs that formed part of a line will hatch and the little Piyos will fly off to collect on either side of the screen. An egg will hatch even if it is no longer part of a line of matching eggs, so long as it is not being held outside of the nest. The remaining eggs will fall to fill in the gaps. When enough points are scored the player's level increases. An additional dimension is added to the controls by the use of the Sixaxis controller's motion-sensing abilities. By shaking the Sixaxis from side-to-side the eggs can be shaken to fall into gaps. Shaking the controller up-and-down will cause the eggs to jump about offering limited control in re-ordering the eggs beyond manipulating them three-at-a-time beyond the nest. If a hatch has started, shaking the controller will cause the eggs to hatch immediately. The maneuver can be particularly useful in the battle mode when the eggs are getting close to filling the nest, which would result in the end of the game. Game modes Piyotama features timed (\\"Piyo Coop\\") and untimed (\\"Free-Range\\") single-player modes, the former allowing high scores to be uploaded to an online leader board via the PlayStation Network. A 2-player \\"Battle Mode\\" is also included for local competitive play. Skins Four skin packs, seasonal graphical themes, have been released for free via the Japanese PlayStation Store. The first was a beach-themed summer pack, the second a Halloween theme, thirdly a Christmas theme and most recently a Valentine's theme. Availability of these packs varies by region as Sony has not released them to all markets. As of the Version 1.24 update to the game, the US release automatically has the following skin options pre- installed: No. 00 \\"Default\\" No. 02 \\"Halloween\\" No. 03 \\"Xmas\\" No. 04 \\"Valentine's Day\\" This bodes well for those hoping for the Beach theme and any possible future themes will be released in other markets outside Japan.

It can grow as a shrub or as a tree reaching 16 m in height. This plant is reportedly toxic to livestock as the foliage (phyllodes) contain a glucoside which can produce hydrogen cyanide if cut. Taxonomy German botanist Johann Christoph Wendland first described this species as Mimosa binervia in 1798, before American botanist James Francis Macbride reclassified it in the genus Acacia in 1919. Common names include coast myall and rosewood. Acacia glaucescens is an illegitimate name. Description Acacia binervia grows as a shrub to small tree anywhere from high. The bark is dark brown to grey in colour, and the elliptic to sickle-shaped (falcate) phyllodes are in length and wide. The cylindrical yellow flowers appear in spring (August to October). Flowering is followed by the development of 6–8 cm long seed pods, which are ripe by December. Distribution and habitat Acacia binervia is found in central New South Wales from the Hunter Region south, and to Bungonia in the southwest, and continuing south into Victoria. In the Sydney basin, it grows on a variety of soils and associated plant communities—alluvial soils, sandstone-, shale- or trachyte-based soils, generally with good drainage. It grows in dry sclerophyll forest, associated with such species as yellow bloodwood (Corymbia eximia), grey gum (Eucalyptus punctata), narrow-leaved ironbark (E. crebra), mugga ironbark (E. sideroxylon), or more open woodland with narrow-leaved ironbark and black cypress pine (Callitris endlicheri), and riparian (riverbank) forest with river peppermint (E. elata) and gossamer wattle (Acacia floribunda). Ecology Acacia binervia regenerates from bushfire by a soil-borne seedbank, the seeds germinate and grow after fire while adult plants are killed. The frequency of fire for the cycle to persist is anywhere from 10 to 50 years. It is useful to bees in the honey industry.

Tagore completed his studies at Hindu College, and thereafter, read English and Sanskrit at home. He also received private tuition from Captain D.L. Richardson and others. His father, Hara Kumar Tagore, was also a learned scholar in the Hindu scriptures, Sanskrit and English. He had compiled critically admired books and assisted Radhakanta Deb (1783 – 1867) in compiling Sabdakalpadrum.Sengupta, Subodh Chandra and Bose, Anjali, p. 611 From an early age, Tagore displayed exceptional literary taste for composition both in English and in Bengali, having written several dramas and farces. One of these works was the Vidya Sundar Nataka, which when performed at his residence, received critical acclaim. When Gnanendramohan Tagore, son of his uncle, Prasanna Coomar Tagore, converted to Christianity in 1851 and was deprived of inheritance for that reason, he inherited the vast property of his uncle. Public life In 1866, Tagore lent help to the ruling administration, donating towards the benefit of famine-stricken farmers in Midnapur. He was Honorary Secretary of the British Indian Association for several years; was elected as its President in 1879; re-elected in 1881. In 1870 he was chosen as a Member of the Legislative Council of Bengal, and reappointed in 1872. In 1871 he received the title of 'Raja Bahadur', and was exempted from attendance in Civil Courts in April of that year. He received the title of Maharaja in 1877, on the occasion of the proclamation of Queen Victoria as Empress of India. He was appointed as a Member of the Legislative Council of the Governor-General in February of that year, and in recognition of his assistance towards the Civil Procedure Bill, was reappointed in 1879. In the latter year, he was created a Companion of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India; and appointed for a third time, a Member of the Viceroy's Council in 1881. Created Knight Commander of the Star of India in May 1882; he received the title of Maharaja-Bahadur in January, 1890, and in January of the following year, this title was made hereditary in his family. Tagore contributed extensively towards the establishment of the Mayo Hospital, resulting in one of the wards being named after him. He also established several scholarships for students of literature, science, culture and history in the names of his father and his uncle, Prasanna Coomar Tagore. He set apart funds for the provision of a gold keyur or armlet, to be annually presented to the best student in Sanskrit literature in Calcutta University; and founded a gold medal for the best student who passed an examination after attending the Tagore Law Lectures, annually, and another gold medal for the best student in Physical Science. He was appointed as a Justice of the Peace for the town of Calcutta, Fellow of the University of Calcutta, Trustee of the Indian Museum (of which he was elected President in the year 1882), one of the Governors of the Mayo Hospital, and a Member of the Asiatic Society. He had the honour of being elected the President of the Reception Committee during the visit of Prince Albert Victor in 1889. He was Vice President of the Syndicate of the Calcutta University in 1881, and President of the Faculty of Arts in 1881-82. He presented to the Calcutta University the marble statue of his uncle, the Hon. Prasanna Kumar Tagore, which is placed in the portico of the Senate House. Jointly with his brother, the Raja Sir Sourindro Mohun Tagore, he presented a piece of land to the Municipality of Calcutta for the construction of a Square (to be named after his father), in which at his own expense, he placed a marble bust of his father. He also founded an endowment for the benefit of Hindu widows, of one lakh of rupees, under the name of the \\"Maharajmata Shib Sundari Debi's Hindu Widows' Fund.\\" The visit of the eighteenth President of the United States of America, General Ulysses S. Grant to Calcutta specifically significant as it was a momentous event in the United Kingdom-United States of America relations of the late nineteenth century. In the papers of Ulysses S. Grant, recently made public, there is a reference to him being entertained at the Tagore household by Sourindro Mohun and his elder brother, Jatindra Mohun – \\"On March 14, 1879, USG (Ulysses S. Grant) met Garth at the Bengal High Court and participated in graduation ceremonies at Calcutta University. USG later attended a party given by the influential Tagore family and praised the traditional entertainment.\\" This entertainment included a number of traditional performances as The Statesman and Friend of India described the occasion: \\"The house, grounds, and lakes were illuminated, and the effect was exceedingly beautiful. The entertainment of the evening consisted of Hindu Music, nautches, and other performances which we are sorry to say, completely beggar our descriptive powers. General Grant said it was the best entertainment of an Oriental character that he had ever witnessed.\\" Similarly, The Indian Mirror reported that: \\"The Party … were treated to a variety of Hindu Music, consisting of different specimens of songs, performances on the Surbahar, Setar, Jaltaranga, Nyastaranga, Kathakata, Panchali, Rasdhari, Jattra, Bengali Jattra, Nautch, Boat-song (in the lake), and the Nagar-Kirtun, with all the paraphernalia which usually accompany the procession of the Vaisnavas.\\" His adopted son and heir was the Maharaj Kumar Prodyot Coomar Tagore; He had four daughters born.out of wedlock. Tagore Castle and the Prasad Tagore Castle in 1907 in Pathuriaghata The first house, on the land where Tagore Castle now stands on at 26 Prasanna Kumar Tagore Street in Pathuriaghata, was built by Kali Kumar Tagore. It was a simple three-storey structure. Kali Kumar had given the house to his younger brother Prasanna Coomar. Jatindra Mohan Tagore inherited the property from Prasanna Coomar. In 1895, Jatindra Mohan demolished the old building and started construction of a new building. The plan for the building was prepared by Macintosh Burn and Company from England. It had a 100 feet high centre tower, inspired by the Windsor castle, a flag staff, and a clock imported from England. The building had large rooms as in the castles of England. There was an auditorium on the second floor, meant mainly for the staging of plays. In 1954, S.B. House and Land Pvt. Ltd. of Haridas Mundhra took over the building and has altered most of it to beyond recognition.Bandopadhyay, Debashis, Bonedi Kolkatar Gharbari, , Second impression 2002, pp. 113-6, Ananda Publishers, Jatindramohan Tagore's primary residence was however, the building opposite the Tagore Castle, known fondly as the Prasad (built in 1884). Personalities like Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, Girish Ghosh, Sisir Ghosh, Rajendra Lal Mishra, Mahendra Lal Sarkar, Ramesh Dutta, Nabin Sen, Haraprasad Shastri, Amritalal Basu, Dwijendralal Roy, Ashutosh Mukhopadhyay and family members like Gaganendranath, Samarendranath and Abanindranath Tagore frequented the Prasad. Banga Natyalaya  Jatindra Mohan Tagore and his brother Shourendra Mohan Tagore, both theatre enthusiasts, started the Banga Natylalay in Pathuriaghata. The plays were reviewed by contemporary newspapers such as Hindu Patriot which flourished under Harish Chandra Mukherjee, and Dwarkanath Vidyabhusan’s Somprakash. The first play to be staged at Banga Natyalaya was Kalidas’ Mālavikāgnimitram in Sanskrit, in July 1859. A year later, a Bengali translation of Pandit Ramnarayan Tarkaratna's play was staged. Even prior to the Banga Natyalaya, plays were staged at their house in Pathuriaghata from time to time. He inspired Michael Madhusudan Dutta to compose Tilottamasambhav Kabya and paid the expenses for the printing it. Music & Painting  Jatindramohan was drawn towards music. Under his patronage Kshetramohan Goswami was the first in India to experiment with orchestra or group music. On 3 July 1857, a drama titled Ratnavali was staged at Jatindramohan's house in Belgachia. He assigned Kshetramohun Goswami and Jadunath Pal to form an orchestra imitating those found in European theatres. It was a path-breaking achievement in a country with the tradition of solo music and was an attempt at fusion of western music with Indian traditions.Mitra, Rajyeshwar, Music in Old Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, p. 183, Oxford University Press, Since then, several Bengali musicians began experimenting with European music, often transposing them into staff notation. India's first Surbahar concert was featured in his court. The famous Gopal Chandra Banerjee, also known as 'Nulo Gopal', the first guru of Sarode maestro Ustad Allauddin Khan resided in his court.Guha Thakurta, Tapati, Art in Old Calcutta: The Melting Pot of Western Styles, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, p. 148 He was also one of the influential art patrons of the day, featuring both as a donor and a purchaser of European paintings at Exhibitions. Other activities A man of varied tastes, he donated extensively for public causes. He spent unhesitatingly for the rehabilitation of widows. In 1870, he was appointed a member of the Legislative Council of Bengal, and was reappointed in 1872. In February 1877, he was appointed a member of the Legislative Council of the Viceroy, being reappointed in 1879.Lethbridge, Sir Roper, The Golden Book of India: A Genealogical and Biographical Dictionary, pp. 307-308. He was secretary and president of British Indian Association, member of the Viceroy's council, Education Commission, Calcutta University, and Indian Museum. He had a museum in Tagore Castle. He wrote extensively in English, Bengali and Sanskrit. Honours He was honoured with the personal title of Raja Bahadur in 1871, which was elevated to Maharaja in January 1877. In January 1890, he was elevated to the title of Maharaja Bahadur, which was made hereditary in January 1891.

November 25, 2010. Photo by George Mel. Samtavisi () is an eleventh-century Georgian Orthodox cathedral in eastern Georgia, in the region of Shida Kartli, some 45 km from the nation's capital Tbilisi, near Igoeti village. The cathedral is now one of the centers of the Eparchy of Samtavisi and Gori of the Georgian Orthodox Church. The church is a typical example and the founder of the Georgian interpretation of the cross-in-square churches. It was built in the period of decorative and artistic bloom in the architecture of Georgia. History The cathedral is located on the left bank of the Lekhura River, some 11 km of the town of Kaspi. According to a Georgian tradition, the first monastery on this place was founded by the Assyrian missionary Isidore in 572 and later rebuilt in the 10th century. Neither of these buildings has survived however. The earliest extant structures date to the eleventh century, the main edifice being built in 1030 as revealed by a now lost stone inscription. The cathedral was built by a local bishop and a skillful architect Hilarion, the son of Vane Kanchaeli, who also authored the nearby church of Ashuriani. The Cathedral was heavily damaged by a series of earthquakes, when the dome and partially the western wall and the pillars collapsed. According to the inscription on the western façade, above the window, which says \\"The secondary builder of the temple was the daughter of king of the kings and the wife of Amilakhor, Gayane\\", the Cathedral was first partially reconstructed in the 15th-16th century. The noble Georgian family Amilakhvari played significant role in the history of the church. In 1679, Givi Amilakhvari and his wife ordered new frescoes to be painted by Samtavisi bishop Meliton, as documented by inscription on the apse fresco. It was reconstructed again in the 19th century by the architect Ripardi, when part of decorations were lost. For example, one of the two gryphons on eastern façade. The masterly decorated eastern façade is the only surviving original structure. Other alterations included removal of portals, widening and deepening of connections between the façade quadrasЗакарая, П. (1983) Памятники Восточной Грузии. Искусство, Москва, 376 с. [Zakaraya, P. Monuments of Eastern Georgia](In Russian). Architecture The Samtavisi Cathedral is a prolonged rectangular 4-piered cruciform domed church. It illustrates a Georgian interpretation of the cross-in-square form which set an example for many churches built in the heyday of medieval Georgia. It currently has only southern portal, but presumably also had northern and western ones. The dome rests on the altar projections and two free pillars. In contrast to earlier Georgian churches, the drum of the dome is taller surmounted by a conical roof. The reconstructed dome tholobate is unproportionally narrow. It has twelve window, seven of them are real, other five imitated. Their original ornamentation, found currently on western façade, was richer than subsequently reconstructed. The central altar apse, the prothesis and the sacristy are in eastern part. The central nave is connected to the lateral naves in the western part through the arcade. The exterior is distinguished by the liberal use of ornamental blind arcading. The apses do not project, but their internal position is marked by deep recesses in the wall. Artistically, the most rounded portion of the church is its five-arched eastern façade, dominated by the two niches and enlivened by a bold ornate cross motif, which is a harmonic continuation of dynamic arcading. The central axis of the façade has a high cross, ornamented window and rather characteristic motif of two rombs, copied in later churches. The most elaborate decoration, a relief of gryphon can be found up in the right arch. The arcading is also spread on lateral façades. The southern façade has remnants of portal. The western façade is plain with two windows. Their ornamentation was previously on the former dome and look rather unharmonious on the wall. Western and eastern façades have inscriptions, telling about the construction year and the architect, and the subsequent reconstruction. Frescoes The original frescoes of the 11th century, found under the apse plaster, are rather fragmentary. The 17th century frescoes, less monumental and less detailed than the earlier, remain only in the dome and the apse. The dome fresco depicts the Christ Pantocrator with six-winged seraphs and evangelists. Prophets are found between the tholobates, and Mary with Jesus among them; below the windows the archangels. Traditional Deesis is depicted in the altar conch. Multifigure Eucharist is found in the upper part of the apse, and below it, bishops with open scrolls and deacons. Dominant colors are dark brown, blue, yellow and dark grey.Закарая, П. (1983) Памятники Восточной Грузии. Искусство, Москва, 376 с. [Zakaraya, P. Monuments of Eastern Georgia](In Russian) Other structures Beyond the main church, the Samtavisi complex includes a badly damaged two- storied bishop's residence, a small church (5.8х3.2m), and a three-storied bell-tower (5.7х7.3m) attached to the 3-5m high fence made of stone and brick. The bell-tower, built into northern wall, dates to the 16th-17th centuries. Its ground floor has a gate, the middle floor was for the guards and the upper the belfry. All other structures date to the 17th-18th centuries. Original wall, surrounding the cathedral, did not survive. The current wall includes a rounded tower with semicircular teeth.

The family was made up of Classes 11 (12), 12 (12), 21 (60) and 27 (60). Classes 11, 12 and 21 were nearly twice as powerful as Classes 22, 23 and 25. Class 27 was more than twice as powerful as the 1950s locomotives. This family was heavily influenced by the Class 202 locomotives built in the mid 1970s. They are very reliable because of the trial and error development of their predecessor. This family came into service with M4 and M5 coaching stock and the AM 80 and AM 86 series of EMUs. This generation was a major modernization of the SNCB even if the older M2 coaching stock remained active for more than a decade. These four sister classes are visually identical except for a few minor details. Class 11's livery is specific to the Benelux service on which they operated on for most of their service lives. Class 27 locomotives are the staple power for SNCB/NMBS. They work all over the 3000 volt electrified lines including the occasional trip through to Luxembourg City. The arrival of Class 13 had little impact on Class 27 at the time as the 13s were occupied with trains of I11 coaching stock and goods trains working on newly electrified sections under 25,000 volts, 50 Hz, where Class 27s could not go. Class 27s were frequently engaged in pulling heavy freights from the Flemish ports to the sorting yard at Montzen, near the German border. They also pulled a number of passenger services including peak hour trains of M5 double deck coaching stock. They have become very active on trains with the newer M6 stock. Locos 2742 to 2760 have been modified with MUX and automatic couplers at one end so they can work in multiple in push-pull trains made up of two Class 27s each with a rake of five M6 coaches running one behind the other. The trains start at separate destinations and join up later to run together as a unit over most of their route. Later they split up and go their separate ways to their final destinations and reverse for the return journey. These locos have been showing frame wear because they were not originally designed for this kind of service so SNCB is monitoring them closely. These MUX locomotives have been replaced on freight duties by Class 13, which have lost most of their passenger duties. Locomotive 2711 currently holds the world record for the longest passenger train ever pulled by a single locomotive. The record was set on 27 April 1991, when the locomotive pulled 70 carriages from Gent to Oostende.

In 1961, his company sent him to Los Angeles to open a regional office and in 1963, he co-founded a real estate consulting firm. In the 1960s, he was very successful developing the booming San Diego market and earned a solid reputation in the industry. In the 1970s, he accepted a position with 20th Century Fox tasked with managing its worldwide real estate investments. Wolff's approach - which he would successfully apply throughout his career - was to find partners willing to fund the majority of the investment and take a more passive role, which would allow Wolff to directly manage the investment himself. In 1994, Wolff founded Maritz, Wolff & Co with Philip Maritz in St. Louis, Missouri. The company owned interest in eighteen hotel and resort properties around the world, including the Fairmont San Jose Hotel, the Fairmont San Francisco, the Carlyle Hotel, the Four Seasons Hotel Nevis, the Four Seasons Hotel Toronto, and the Park Hyatt Sydney. In 2011 Wolff and his partner, Philip Maritz, orchestrated the $800 million sale of five hotels, including The Carlyle and the Rosewood Management Company to New World, a Hong Kong-based real estate and hotel company. Wolff has a long history of sports franchise ownership. In the past, he has been a co-owner of the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League and the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association. On April 1, 2005, Wolff and an ownership group led by The Gap heir, John J.

At the 2007 MLS All Star Game, it was announced that Wolff had exercised the option, and the Earthquakes began play during the 2008 MLS season.  Philanthropy  Under Wolff's ownership, the Oakland Athletics were community-minded. In 2011, Sony Pictures complied with Wolff's wishes in staging the motion picture premiere of Moneyball in Oakland, including a charity component that raised $370,000 for the Children's Hospital and Research Center Oakland and Stand Up To Cancer. Lew is also an active participant in the A's Home Run Readers program. The San Jose Mercury-News ranked Wolff first in its annual listing of the Bay Area's 25 Most Powerful Sports Figures in both 2006 and 2007.

His initial attempts to relocate took place in 2006 when he sought to move the team to Fremont. After Fremont fell through, Wolff began advocating a move to a new ballpark in San Jose. However, the San Francisco Giants own the territorial rights to San Jose, and the two teams appeared to be at an impasse. In the past, some fans have called for Wolff to sell the team. He was also criticized for covering almost all of the upper deck of Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum with a tarp, eliminating the use of the upper deck with the exception of the \\"Value Deck\\" sections, just behind home plate.

They earned their keep in their last years of service by pulling commuter \\"P\\" trains in the Liège area.  History  These five locomotives were constructed in 1962 by La Brugeoise et Nivelles and were the first polycurrent locomotives ordered by SNCB/NMBS. They were designed for use on the 25 kV 50 Hz system in Northern France, the 3 kV DC system used in Belgium and the 1.5 kV DC system in use in the Netherlands. Prior to the January 1971 renumbering, they were known in the six-number scheme as Type 150, and were numbered 150.001 to 150.005. In the early 1980s, lacking the power to haul increasingly heavy TEE trains, the Series 15 power units were replaced by the SNCF Class CC 40100 locomotives between Paris and Brussels, but they continued to be used on services between Brussels to Amsterdam until the late 1980s, when they were withdrawn due to lack of compatibility with the new Dutch ATB signaling system. The Series 15 locomotives were then used on international trains between Liège and Paris, while being progressively incorporated into the Belgian domestic service, in particular on the Ostende-Liège line. The units were stored in December 2000. A lack of suitable locomotives following the electrification of Line 43 between Liege and Luxembourg resulted in the locomotives returning to service to haul \\"P\\" (Peak hour) trains.

Started in the year 1930, this group has staged many drama performances and is famous for its ballets. One of the most popular of their ballets is Cinderella, based on the English fairy tale and since 1977, has been staged more than a thousand times by the troupe. History Prabhat Kalavidaru was created in 1930 by a group of four brothers Gopinath Dasa, Karigiri Dasa, Jaisimha Dasa, and Dwarakanath who hailed from a traditional Brahmin family and were Harikatha exponents. The group was named Gururaja Orchestra and Nataka Mandali and was based in Tumkur. Later, financial trouble and the quest for a larger audience brought the family to Bangalore. Gopinath Dasa, regarded as the de facto leader of the group, incorporated new technologies in the performances and this helped draw large audiences. Rather than just being narrative, the plays incorporated themes from dances and folk traditions which was different than what was offered by the traditional drama troupes and this is considered an important reason for their success. The group was renamed Prabhat Kalavidaru in the year 1942. One of the first troupes to present Indian classical dance forms in the form of ballet, historians opine that the emergence of Prabhat Kalavidaru also heralded a cultural renaissance in the state of Karnataka. Some of the well-known artists of Kannada cinema like C. R. Simha, Srinath, Manjula and Lokesh started their careers with Prabhat Kalavidaru. Initially, many of the artists and technicians involved in the performances belonged to the founding family and at one point there were as many as 60 members of the family, spanning four generations who were actively involved. Now many people from outside the family are also involved in the affairs of the troupe. Ballets Prabhat Kalavidaru has produced about 20 ballets; some of which are Mohini Bhasmasura, Karnataka Vaibhava, Kindari Jogi, Rama Pratiksha, and Punyakoti. Lot of experimentation is involved in enacting these dramas like amalgamating Western dance forms with Indian classical dance forms to create some sort of a fusion dance style and also using special lighting techniques to enhance the appeal of the drama. Prabhat Kalavidaru were one of the first theatre groups in India to introduce pre-recorded dialogues and lip- synchronisation. To compose songs and music for their plays, the troupe had built a small recording studio in their house itself. They also manufacture the masks, headgear, shields, swords, silk and velvet costumes needed for the plays. Creation of a play is a complex task and it takes about two years and a budget of about Rs. 1 to 1.5 million ($25 to 35 thousand) for the group to produce a play. The troupe's most popular production to date is Cinderella which has been performed more than a thousand times. Initially staged as a musical, the drama has undergone changes with time and in the 1000th performance; new music, stage settings and lightings were used. Though the artists involved have changed over the years, two performers, M S Shanthala and Subbanna, have the record of performing right from the first edition of Cinderella to the 1000th one. However, Malathi Simha (Daughter of founding member - Dwarkanath Das) has performed more than 600 shows of Cinderella as Cinderella. Other activities Prabhat Kalavidaru also rents out the costumes, audio equipment and stage sets to other theatre groups and this is another source of income for them. They also run a dance school which is headed by Hema Panchamukhi, a famous actress in Kannada Cinema and the granddaughter of the founder Gopinath Dasa. Current Scenario The family has split up currently and many members have settled in the United States. However, the group still stages plays and despite more outsiders getting involved in the production of the plays, the overall management is looked after by one of the family members. They recently created their website www.prabhathkalavidaru.com which has all the details of their performances.

The book was awarded the Gouden Griffel literary award in 2005. The English translation was published in 2006. Plot summary The book, set in Amsterdam, relates the tale of a nine-year-old boy named Thomas who see things no one else can, such as invisible hail that \\"ripped all the leaves from the trees\\", and tropical fish in the canal. Thomas lives in a family of four: his parents and his sister, Margot. They are not, however, a harmonious family, as their father repeatedly hits their mother, and punishes Thomas by beating him with a wooden spoon. He is a very religious man, but he fears embarrassment and is said to \\"not belong with people\\". Thomas writes down everything in his \\"Book of Everything\\", a diary which holds his thoughts. Characters=Thomas Thomas is the hero of the story. Although he is young, he knows a lot and is never afraid to ask questions. He has visions of Jesus and talks to him. He is said to be a good boy with a lovely personality. He says that \\"when I grow up, I'm going to be happy\\". In the prologue, the author asks the aged Thomas whether he became happy, and is answered, \\"Yes.\\" Thomas has many friends in the book such as Eliza, a girl with a wooden leg and a hurt hand. Thomas writes her a love letter early in the book, and later tells Jesus that he will marry her, and receives the Lord's blessing. Margot Margot is Thomas's older sister. Thomas describes her as, \\"dumb as an onion,\\" though much of her apparent stupidity is a farce. She has a way of knowing things. At a particularly violent point of the story, where the father is threatening to hurt Thomas and his mother, Margot grabs the carving knife and threatens Father with it, saying that \\"I've had it up to here\\". Thomas's respect for her grows as the story progresses. Thomas notes later in the story when Margot was looking dead into Father's eyes that she '...was no longer afraid, and I saw her become a witch before my very eyes.' Father Father has a very strict personality who does not believe in niceness or mercy, saying that \\"only good- for-nothings and weaklings are happy. Life is a struggle.\\" He has shut himself off from people. He is shown to be a coward. He is a very religious man, raising his family up to what he thinks is God's standard. Mother Mother is very nice to her son Thomas. She hides the fact that her husband hits her. She often takes the blow for Thomas' mistakes. She agrees to starting the 'Reading Aloud' club with Mrs. van Amersfoort, which lets her and Thomas grow. Mrs. van Amersfoort Mrs. van Amersfoort is a war survivor who is said to be a witch. In the story a 'witch' is defined to be women who is no longer afraid. She has a very messy house and two black cats. Her husband was executed in World War II for being a part of the Resistance. She also helps Thomas to stop being afraid, and aids him when he starts to set up the Plagues of Egypt to scare Father, first by giving Thomas her cordial so he can dye his aquarium red like blood, and next by summoning a plague of frogs, until Thomas calls off the plagues. She learns from Thomas and helps him and his mother stand up to his father and go against his word. She is a very independent woman. Eliza Eliza is Margot's friend from school. She is sixteen. Thomas wrote her a letter explaining that he thought she was a beautiful girl. She has a leather leg that creaks when she walks, and a missing finger on her left hand. She helps Thomas grow and not be afraid anymore. Thomas notes that he will marry her when he is older. She is smart and is not afraid to showcase her amazement in Thomas.

Currently located at 600H, Vale of Tempe Road, 11200 Tanjung Bungah, it was the pioneer deaf school in Malaysia. The Federation School has a very important place in Malaysia's Deaf community as the first boarding school for deaf children in Malaya (the Chinese Deaf School in Singapore was founded in the same year). History of the establishment In 1952, Dr C Elaine Field, a medical specialist, visited Penang to treat deaf children. Having met and interviewed some of the deaf children about their welfare, Dr Field realised that there were no education programmes for deaf children in Malaya. Dr Field met with Lady Templer, the wife of Sir Gerald Templer, British High Commissioner in Malaya, during an official visit to Penang. On 9 December 1952, Lady Templer chaired a special meeting at the Residency (official residence of the Resident Commissioner of Penang), which agreed to channel funds for the establishment of a school for the deaf. In 1954, the Federation School for the Deaf officially opened its doors at No. 47, Northam Road, George Town, Penang. It was the first school for the deaf in Malaya, and offered primary education to deaf students. R.P. Bingham, the Resident Commissioner of Penang, supported the establishment and became the first Chairman of the Board of Governors. The school 1954-1961 Miss J. M. Hickes was appointed as the first principal of the school. At the beginning, the school housed only seven students and two teachers. The entry age was not fixed, with some students entering at 3 or 4 and others at 9. By 1959, the number of students had increased to 60 students. Students who completed Standard 6 did not continue their education, but were given the opportunity to gain vocational skills such as sewing, woodworking and repairing. At that time, the school was not funded by the Government, but was organised by volunteers and non-government organisations. Towards secondary education (1961 - 1970) In 1961, Miss J.M. Hicks resigned as principal and was succeeded by Miss Lee Kooi Jong, originally a nurse at the Penang General Hospital, who had previously served as the first Secretary to the Board of Governors and as a teacher at the school. Lee persuaded businessmen and entrepreneurs in Penang to give opportunities to the deaf children to gain work experience at their companies. FSD students who completed Standard 6 received offers to work at companies doing printing, sewing, and other trades. Lee (known as Dato' Hajah Saleena Yahaya Isa after her conversion to Islam) also increased the length of courses from 6 years to 10 years. Years 8, 9 and 10 received on-the-job vocational training after school. The first students to sit for the Lower Certificate of Education (L.C.E.) were registered 1969, with a 100% pass rate. Secondary education was finally offered at FSD from 1970. Due to the growth of the school, the site at Northam Road was deemed to be inadequate, and the Board of Governors, decided to relocated the school to a new site. At the end of 1963, a 12-hectare site at Vale of Tempe Road (Jalan Lembah Permai) in Tanjong Bungah was bought at 65 cents per square foot, with Mr (later Tan Sri) Loh Boon Siew, the director of the company that sold the land, sponsoring 15 cents per square foot. The Ministry of Rural Development of Malaysia contributed $500,000 for the construction of school buildings. The school at Northam Road was sold at the price $340,000 to fund the new school at Tanjung Bungah. Pursuant to the agreement between the school and the buyer, the school would remain at the old premises for two years until the new school was scheduled to open in 1965. Unfortunately, the school was not completed within the two years. The Board of Governors suggested that the school close down until the problem was solved, but the principal, Mrs Saleena objected to the disruption to the children's education, and turned to the State Education Department, through the Inspector of Chinese Schools, for help. As a result, Shih Chung Primary School was chosen to accommodate the FSD students during the afternoon session. The problem of hostelling was solved by placing the boys at the Charity Home next to Eastern & Oriental Hotel, while the girls were placed at Poh Leung Kok (now Cheshire Home). The school's office was placed at the Trustees Office at the High Court. Six months later, the school was reunited in a building at Poh Leung Kok, after the authorities of Poh Leung Kok allowed the school to use the whole of its premises. FSD as a government aided school The school was finally reopened in 1970, the opening ceremony was attended by the first Malaysians Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman. At the same time, the school became the first deaf school to receive government-aided status. From Oral Communication to Total Communication Initially, Form 4 and 5 students were attached to normal schools such as Sekolah Menengah Jelutong and Sekolah Menengah Tanjung Bungah in Penang. However, the deaf students found it difficult to cope with the teaching at those schools, and the FSD subsequently expanded to teach at the higher secondary level. Eleanor Culas who was the first FSD student to study at Gallaudet University, which is a deaf university in Washington D.C., United States. She was impressed with American Sign Language used by the Deaf community in the United States. She was convinced that American Sign Language would be useful in Malaysia. Culas was not satisfied with the current system used in Malaysia, where a Manchester-based Oral method was adopted. Therefore, Eleanor asked Frances M. Parsons, a Gallaudet lecturer, deaf herself with a strong preference for Signed English, to stop-by in Malaysia and share her expertise in Deaf Education with the FSD teachers. In 1976, Frances Parsons visited FSD, and persuaded Saleena and other teachers that the Total Communication system would help to increase the understanding and mastery of American Sign Language. In order to prove the effectiveness of the system, Parsons started a Total Communication class and demonstrated the \\"Manual Sign\\" method using Signed English with signs borrowed from American Sign Language to FSD teachers for one month. Meanwhile, Saleena arranged a meeting between Parsons with Dr Mahathir bin Mohammad, the Minister of Education, where Parsons explained the effectiveness of the system was comparable to learning by hearing. The Ministry of Education approved a pilot class that used only Total Communication, and FSD was chosen to experiment with this method. The class was given 5 years to test its effectiveness. However, after 3 years of probation, the Total Communication class was proved far better than the Oral communication class. The school development (1980s)List of FSD principals (1954–1961) Miss J.M.

She became the Queen of Württemberg upon her marriage to her first cousin Crown Prince William who eventually became King William I of Württemberg in 1816. Early life Ekaterina was born in Tsarskoye Selo and named after her grandmother, Catherine the Great. Described as beautiful and vivacious, she had a happy childhood and her education was carefully supervised by her mother. Ekaterina received the best education and constantly furthered her education through reading new literary publications and personal contacts with various outstanding persons. Known as Katya in the family, she was very close to her siblings, particularly her eldest brother Tsar Alexander I. Throughout her life she would maintain a close relationship with him. It was said that she was Alexander's favorite sister and one of the few persons he loved unconditionally. His letters to her are expressed in phrases like \\"I am yours, heart and soul, for life\\", \\"I think that I love you more with each day that passes\\", and \\"to love you more than I do is impossible\\". Although Paul and Maria Feodorovna were initially disappointed at the birth of a fourth daughter, Ekaterina later became her mother's favorite daughter. First marriage While the Napoleonic Wars were still in progress, the childless Napoléon I arranged his divorce from his beloved but aged wife Empress Joséphine, in order to marry a princess of high birth, get connected to royalty and beget the much desired heir. While the divorce itself did not happen until 1810, Napoleon was on the lookout for a new wife for some years previous to that, and seriously considered Ekaterina as a candidate - in addition to everything else, such a marriage would also provide strategic advantage by drawing the Russians to his side. The matter was broached or hinted at by the French delegation, at the behest of Talleyrand, at a meeting between them and the Russians at Erfurt in 1808. Ekaterina's family was utterly horrified, and the Dowager Empress immediately arranged a marriage for her daughter to her nephew, Duke George of Oldenburg. Thus, Ekaterina was married to her first cousin Duke George of Oldenburg on 3 August 1809. George was the second son of Peter, Duke of Oldenburg and his wife, Duchess Friederike of Württemberg. The couple resided in Tver, where George had been appointed governor general. Catherine lived a lavish court life and entertained with balls, grand dinners and similar events in the pattern of the Imperial court, to create \\"a Small Saint Petersburg\\" in Tver. The couple were quickly blessed with two sons: Peter George (b. 1810) and Konstantin Friedrich Peter (b. 1812). Although the match had been arranged by their families, Ekaterina was devoted to her husband, and the marriage was harmonious. It was said that he was not handsome but Ekaterina cared for him deeply, and his death in 1812, due to typhoid fever, was a very severe shock to her. They had been married barely three years, and Ekaterina, now the mother of two infant sons, was only 24 years old. While residing in Tver with George, Ekaterina supported N.M. Karamzin to write his later famous historical work. Tsar Alexander adopted reactionary ideas from a patriotic group which she dominated. In 1812, some conspirators who planned to depose Tsar Alexander had the ambitions to put her on the throne as Empress Catherine III. In 1812, she supported the suggestion to summon a national militia, and formed a special regiment of chasseurs which took part in many of the great battles of the era. Second marriage Following the death of her husband, Ekaterina spent much of the next few years with her siblings, especially her brother the Tsar with whom she had a very close relationship. During 1813-1815, she travelled to England with her brother Tsar Alexander I to meet the Prince Regent. She was again with her brother during the Congress of Vienna in 1815. She was not without influence upon his political acts during these trips. She also promoted the marriage between her youngest sister Anna and William II of the Netherlands during this time. In England, Ekaterina met her first cousin, the Crown Prince William of Württemberg. It was love at first sight for the couple. However, William was married to princess Caroline Augusta of Bavaria; he took the drastic step of divorcing her. The background to this turn of events is that William and Caroline Augusta had hastily married each other in order to avoid a political marriage devised by Napoleon. They had never got on with each other, and both of them claimed, at the time of seeking an annulment, that their marriage had never been consummated. The annulment was duly granted by the papacy on grounds of non-consummation. Shortly afterwards (in 1816), Caroline Augusta married Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor and became Empress Consort of Austria. Very early in the year 1816, Ekaterina was married to the newly divorced William. The wedding was held in Saint Petersburg. The couple was immediately blessed with a daughter, Marie Frederikke Charlotte, who was born on 30 October 1816, perchance the very day on which Ekaterina's father-in-law, Frederick I of Wurttemberg, died. The day therefore marked her husband's accession as king, and Ekaterina, now Queen Katharina of Württemberg, became active in charity works in her adopted homeland. She established numerous institutions for the benefit of the public. She supported elementary education and organized a charity foundation during the hunger of 1816. In 1818, she gave birth to another daughter, Sophie Frederike Mathilde, who would marry Ekaterina's nephew William III of Orange and become Queen of the Netherlands. Death In January 1819, six months after the birth of her youngest child, Ekaterina died at Stuttgart of erysipelas complicated by pneumonia. She was thirty years old, and left behind four children, dispersed across two different families, the eldest of whom was barely eight years old. After her death, her surviving husband built Württemberg Mausoleum in Rotenberg, Stuttgart, dedicated to her memory. William later married again; his next wife was his first cousin, Princess Pauline of Württemberg.

The film features Sharmila Tagore, Javed Jaffrey, Anant Mahadevan, Girish Karnad, Benjamin Gilani, Rushad Rana, Andrea Tully, and Pia Shah in supporting roles. In March 2008, the cast and crew filmed in Calgary, Alberta, Canada and a few parts were noticed to be the Western Cape of South Africa. It was previously called Tasveer, but changed due to the director's insistence that the title was jinxed. The film's music is composed by Salim–Sulaiman with a title track by Bohemia. The film follows an Alberta-based forest ranger who has the mental ability to enter a photograph from a person's point of view and re-experience the events witnessed by the person. When his father dies under mysterious circumstances, he is compelled by a former detective to use his abilities in order to catch the killer despite everyone believing it to be a natural death. He soon finds himself hunted by rivals who don't want him to learn the truth. The film was released theatrically on 3 April 2009. Following the mixed reception, it became a commercial failure. Plot Jai Puri, a forest ranger in Alberta, Canada, has the ability to enter a photograph and re-experience the events from a person's point of view. While partying on a boat, his father Jatin meets with an accident. Following his death, a former detective Habeebullah Pasha \\"Happi\\" meets Jai and tells him that Jatin had done him a lot of favors, due to which he wants to catch his murderer. Jai initially believes Jatin died naturally due to a heart attack, but decides to use his skills and enter an 8x10 photograph of Jatin, his brother Sunder, his longtime friend and lawyer Anil, and his surrogate son Adit, clicked by Jai's mother Savitri while on the boat. He enters the photo from Jatin's point of view and sees him falling to his death. However, due to staying within the photograph for more than a minute, Jai gets admitted to hospital. He suspects Sunder who watched Jatin fall to death, and chases him but the latter escapes. Happi believes someone gave Jatin extra beta blockers since he had suffered from two heart attacks earlier, and falling into the cold water led to a heart attack. Jai re-enters the photo from Sunder's point of view and sees him mixing the pills into Jatin's drink. Jai is readmitted to the hospital and tells Sheila about everything including his abilities, before they break into Sunder's house and find his strangled corpse. Soon, Jai and Sheila are pursued by a black SUV that tries to kill them. Jai chases the vehicle but the driver manages to flee. Happi enlists the help of Sally, a nurse who helps with medical aide to Jai as he enters the photo from Anil's point of view and sees him talk to Savitri about something she doesn't want a part in. Jai re-enters enters the photo from Adit's point of view and realizes it was him who gave Sunder the pills to mix in Jatin's drink. Adit, realizing Jai knows the truth, tries to kill him but flees when Happi returns after receiving a message from Jai about Adit being the killer. Later, Anil reveals that Jatin wanted to give his wealth to Jai's environment company, due to which the three men planned to kill Jai so that they don't lose their share. Jai realizes Savitri is in danger as she's about to transfer the money, and gets stabbed before Jai arrives and a chase ensues. The attacker manages to escape, but Savitri tells Jai to look for a box inside a room, which he does. He gets an adrenaline injection from Sally, and informs Happi that Jatin saw someone before falling, and that was what he wanted to tell Jai about earlier. He re-enters from Jatin's point of view, and is left in a stupor when the attacker enters and burns the photograph. The attacker and the last person Jatin saw turns out to be Jai's small twin brother Jeet, whose falling from a cliff led to Jai gaining his ability. Jeet, who was assumed dead, believed Jai pushed him on purpose, and a doctor advised Savitri and Jatin to erase Jeet's memories so as to cure Jai. Sheila had been working with Jeet and helped him copy Jai's lifestyle and habits so that he can replace him after killing him. Jeet had also disclosed his identity to Savitri after stabbing her, due to which she told Jai to look for the box containing their photos. However, Jai gains consciousness due to having injected the adrenaline and a brawl ensues, leading to Happi getting killed by Sheila and Jai getting thrown into the water, where he also discovers the corpse of Adit but manages to free himself. Jai holds Sheila on gunpoint and convinces Jeet that his falling from the cliff was merely an accident. He assures him that they can reunite, before Sheila shoots Jeet and herself gets shot by him.

The film was further delayed because of the producers-distributors dispute with exhibitors over revenue-sharing terms and the IPL. The Guild had decided not to release any new films after 3 April, but paying heed to Percept Picture Company's request, decided that the strike would commence after 4 April facilitating the film's 3 April release., Times of India Close to the release of the film, rumors spread that the release would be stalled due to certain misunderstandings between the producers Percept Picture Company and the music distributors T-Series. Cheques of Rs 66.7 million given by PPC to T Series bounced giving rise to rumours that the film would not be released on the stipulated date. However, PPC CEO Navin Shah, confirmed that the cheques had bounced but also stated that a demand draft had already been given to the music partners and that film's release would be on schedule.FinancialExpress.com Release The film was expected to lure audiences to theaters primarily because of a public holiday on 3 April but the film failed to garner much appreciation and opened to a lowly 30%–40% start at major multiplexes across the country.http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/box- office/2009/8x10-tasveer-disappoints-060409.html The film was stiffly contested by Fast & Furious at the box office. Particularly in Maharashtra, the film was highly surpassed by Mahesh Manjrekar's Marathi film Me Shivajiraje Bhosale Boltoy.http://sify.com/movies/bollywood/fullstory.php?id=14879317 Filmmakers believe that the primary reasons for the film's disappointing run at the box office was the lack of a blockbuster soundtrack and a less targeted promotion. Vivek Agnihotri stated \\"I saw the film in an empty theater. One of the main reasons why I think the film didn't even take an opening is due to Akshay's brand promise which is pure entertainment. I think makers couldn't exploit it's a result, they not just wasted an opportunity but also annoyed viewers who love Akshay. Also, no one understood the genre of the film.\\"http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/features/2009/04/11/5066/index.html Box office 8 x 10 Tasveer grossed 235.80 million worldwide.https://www.boxofficeindia.com/movie.php?movieid=152 It was a disaster yet Akshay Kumar commented that the film is one of his favorite films he had done. Critical reception The film was panned by critics. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 1.5 out of 5, saying, \\"The film goes wrong, in fact horribly wrong, in the penultimate 20-25 minutes, which is the lifeline of any suspense-thriller. Nagesh Kukunoor has missed the bus this time!\\" Most of the critics criticized the second half of the movie. Rajeev Masand of CNN IBN also criticized the movie and rated it a 1/5. Nikhat Kazmi for The Times of India rated it an average 2/5, saying, \\"There's nothing really to cheer you up in the desultory proceedings, unless you want to watch chubby-cheeked Ayesha and lissome Akshay go mountain biking when he's not squirming in the time machine\\". Sashi Baliga from the Hindustan Times also gave the movie a 2/5. Music The music was composed by Salim–Sulaiman, with lyrics by Neeraj Sridhar and Irfan Siddiqui. The American rap artist Bohemia wrote, produced and sang the title song for Akshay Kumar. The music's reception was average. Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama gave the music 2 out of 5 stars and said, \\"8x10 Tasveer has an average soundtrack with \\"Nazaara Hai\\" being the pick of the lot. The two romantic numbers do not go an extra distance though the solo rap song \\"I Got The Picture\\" does make for an interesting hear\\".BollywoodHungama.com Atta Khan of Planet Bollywood rated the music 4/10 saying, \\"The music of 8x10 Tasveer is a huge let down and I'm surprised it got the backing of Nagesh based on the high standards he set for previous soundtracks.

The program succeeded (and was itself, ultimately succeeded by) the CBS Radio Network's package. Background On March 6, 1985, NBC Radio and the National Football League entered into a two-year agreement granting NBC the radio rights to a 37-game package in each of the 1985–1986 seasons. The package included 27 regular season games and 10 postseason games. Prior to 1985 NBC Radio, as early as 1934, had carried a handful of NFL games; it was particularly associated with carrying the Detroit Lions' annual Thanksgiving contests nationwide since their inception, helping to establish the Lions as a permanent part of the Thanksgiving tradition.Jaworowski, Matt (November 24, 2016). Timeline: How football became a Thanksgiving tradition. WIVB-TV. Retrieved November 24, 2016. On April 5, 1961, NBC was awarded a two-year contract for radio and television rights to the NFL Championship Game for US$615,000 annually, $300,000 of which was to go directly into the NFL Player Benefit Plan. From the 1966–1976 seasons, NBC Radio alternated with CBS Radio in coverage of the Super Bowl. After sharing coverage of Super Bowl I, NBC Radio would go on to broadcast only odd numbered Super Bowls. Jim Simpson served as the play-by- play man for all of NBC Radio's broadcasts (with the exceptions of Super Bowl III, which was called by Charlie Jones and Super Bowl V, which was called by Jay Randolph) during this era. Simpson, Jones and Randolph were joined on color commentary by George Ratterman (Super Bowls I and III), Pat Summerall (Super Bowl III), Al DeRogatis (Super Bowl V), Kyle Rote (Super Bowl VII), and John Brodie (Super Bowls IX and XI). For their coverage of Super Bowl III at the end of the 1968 season, NBC used Pat Summerall (best known for his work for CBS and subsequently, Fox) to provide an \\"NFL prospective\\" on the coverage. This was due in part to the fact that NBC was at the time, the network television provider of the American Football League (whereas CBS was the network television provider for the pre-merger National Football League). In return, for CBS Radio's coverage of Super Bowls I, II and IV, they used Tom Hedrick, normally the radio voice of the Kansas City Chiefs, to provide an \\"AFL perspective\\" for their coverage. Ratings In January 1986, NBC Radio figures indicated an audience of 10 million for their coverage Super Bowl XX between the Chicago Bears and New England Patriots. In 1987, NBC Radio's broadcast of Super Bowl XXI between the New York Giants and Denver Broncos was heard by a record 10.1 million people.

Westwood One (along with its NFL rights) was acquired by Dial Global in 2011, and following the 2011 postseason Dial Global retired the Westwood One branding. In 2012, Dial Global announced it would be the distributor for NBC Sports Radio programming once the network launched in 2013, but has yet to make an announcement regarding whether or not the NFL coverage will assume NBC branding or keep the CBS branding (as it currently is). Dial Global changed names again re-assuming the Westwood One name now all NFL content is under the title of the NFL on Westood One. The former Westwood One had a long-standing relationship with CBS Radio. CBS' parent company owned the network for approximately ten years (1998–2008) and, through the CBS Radio Network, maintained control of the production of certain programming, including NFL games, an arrangement that continued following Westwood One's acquisition by Dial Global through the end of the 2011 NFL season. Westwood One now acknowledges the NBC Radio broadcasts as part of the entire history of the network's football coverage. NBC NFL Sunday In 2006, the NBC television network, resumed their National Football League coverage (under the NBC Sunday Night Football umbrella) for the first time since losing the American Football Conference package to CBS after the 1997 season. As part of the relaunch of their coverage, NBC became a co-producer of Westwood One's radio pregame/highlight show NFL Sunday, adding the network's name to the coverage and turning it into an abbreviated radio version of Football Night in America. Al Trautwig hosted the show for the first several weeks of the season before being taken off the coverage for unspecified reasons. Chris Carlin subbed for Trautwig for a week before Scott Graham took over the hosting duties and continued to helm the show for the remainder of the season. In addition to the typical NFL Sunday score rundown and preview of the game ahead, NBC analysts (usually Jerome Bettis or Cris Collinsworth) would provide commentary. After the 2006 season, Westwood One returned NFL Sunday to its previous format and ended the co-production arrangement with NBC.

Carnivàle is an American fantasy television series created by Daniel Knauf for HBO. The series premiered on September 14, 2003, on HBO and finished its two-season run of 24 episodes on March 27, 2005. Until late in the second season, each episode is split into two distinct but slowly converging storylines taking place in the United States Dustbowl of the mid-1930s. Nick Stahl starred as Ben Hawkins, a young Okie farmer with strange powers who joins a traveling carnival; Clancy Brown played his adversary Brother Justin Crowe, a California preacher who uses his similarly strange abilities to rise to power. Carnivàle was originally intended to run as a trilogy of paired seasons, with each pair being called a \\"book\\" and the series as a whole spanning the years from 1934 to 1945, but the series was canceled after two seasons due to low ratings. These two seasons complete the first book covering the years 1934 and 1935. The second book (seasons three and four) would have taken place around the years 1939 and 1940, and the third book (seasons five and six) would have played in 1944 and 1945, leading up to the end of World War II and the explosion at the Trinity test site. Daniel Knauf at Carny Con 2006. Available on a Convention DVD via Carnycon.com. Event summarized at Yahoo Carnivale HBO , (registration required) (April 25, 2006). Retrieved August 5, 2007. The character of Samson, the diminutive co-manager of the carnival, sets up each season with a monologue, giving glimpses of the show's complex story and good-versus-evil mythology. By telling the story visually and deploying dialogue sparely, Carnivàle is a demanding show with a lot of subtext, and similar to reading chapters of a book, viewers need to watch episodes of Carnivàle in the right order or risk being spoiled with too little or too much story information. Many reviewers found the story too slow and confusing, but praised the show for its cinematography and realistic portrayal of the 1930s. Carnivàle received much award recognition in mostly technical categories, including fifteen Emmy nominations with five wins. The stops of the carnival throughout the Southwestern United States play a significant part in the show, with many episodes bearing the name of the location of Ben and the carnival. Some stops like Alamogordo, New Mexico are of historical significance; others are fictional. The only episode titled after Brother Justin's location is Season 1's \\"The River\\". Both seasons of Carnivàle were filmed in Southern California, with the carnival set being moved to movie ranches and Lancaster. Brother Justin's story in the fictional Mintern, California was shot at Paramount Ranch in Malibu. The permanent filming location of the carnival in Season 2 was Big Sky Ranch, which was also used for Brother Justin's new home in fictional New Canaan. The show's interiors were filmed at Santa Clarita Studios.  Series overview  Episodes = Season 1 (2003)  Season 2 (2005) =Location notes Carnival stops. a. ^ Mintern is a fictional town in the San Joaquin Valley in San Benito County, California, near Salinas. * Norman: \\"The Buick Phaeton. Silver and black. Runs like a greyhound. Salinas to Mintern in just over an hour.\\" (\\"After the Ball is Over\\"). * Tommy Dolan: \\"Val [Templeton] is an important man here in Mintern. Indeed, he is fast becoming one of the most important men in the entire San Joaquin Valley.\\" (\\"The River\\"). * Tommy Dolan: \\"Your car was seen leaving the area ten minutes before the fire.\\" / Brother Justin: \\"A Model A was seen.\\" / Dolan: \\"A black Model A Sedan was seen.\\" / Justin: \\"There must be thousands.\\" / Dolan: \\"Right, but only 29 registered in San Benito County and four in Mintern property.\\" (\\"Los Moscos\\"). When Brother Justin loses his faith in God in the middle of Season 1, he leaves his Mintern home and heads for the San Joaquin Valley wilderness near Kingsburg. * Tommy Dolan: \\"Tonight, I'd like to tell you another story I found on the road in the Great San Joaquin Valley. […] It's the story of a man named Brother Justin and a town called Mintern.\\" (\\"Pick a Number\\"). * Tommy Dolan: \\"We [Justin and I] were passing a bottle around a campfire just outside Kingsburg.\\" (\\"The River\\"). After visiting Norman in the hospital early in Season 2, Brother Justin and Iris head home and pass a tree; Justin names this location \\"New Canaan\\", the future site of his temple. New Canaan is also located in San Benito County, California, south of Salinas. * Ned Munson: \\"Without them Okies, Devine has a fix on the whole district.\\" / Brother Justin: \\"Once the voters of San Benito County understand the choice presented to them, there will be no question for whom they will cast their ballot.\\" (\\"Outside New Canaan\\"). * Samson: \\"We're going to New Canaan. […] Big Christian camp in California. Couple hours from here. […] South of Salinas.\\" (\\"Outside New Canaan\\"). The last Season 2 episode is named \\"New Canaan, CA\\" on DVDs. b. ^ Babylon is a fictional town in Texas.Postmark on Scudder's letter to Rebecca Donovan: \\"BABYLON - JUL 24, 1921 P.M. - TEX\\" (\\"Alamogordo, NM\\"). It became a ghost town after a cave-in in 1921 killed all miners but Scudder. There is a historical reference to a real Babylon, Texas located in Navarro County. c. ^ Los Moscos is a real area in Chihuahua, Mexico, near the southwest U.S. New Mexico border, but its significance as the name of the first season 2 episode is never clarified. It is however established that Ben and the carnival spend most of their time in Loving, New Mexico during this and the previous episodes.Streetsign: \\"Welcome to Loving, N.M. Pop. 2,315\\" (\\"Hot and Bothered\\"). Carnivàle suggests that Loving does not refer to Loving, New Mexico in the southeast of the state, near Texas, since the (fictional) town is said to be less than a mile from the Mexican border in the Western part of New Mexico, * Jonesy: \\"We're less than a mile from the [Mexican] border.\\" (\\"Hot and Bothered\\"). * Streetsign on Ben's route from Loving to Alamogordo: \\"Las Cruces 95; Alamogordo 165.\\" (\\"Los Moscos\\"). thematically and geographically likely close to Los Moscos. d. Alamogordo, New Mexico was the headquarters of the Trinity site, where humankind's first nuclear test took place in 1945. Ben's vision of the atomic bomb takes place in a desert nearby, ten years before the nuclear explosion would actually occur. e. ^ Lincoln Highway is the first road across America, conceived in 1912. During the episode, the carnival rests in Wyoming close to the Nebraska border, * Streetsign near the carnival's location: \\"Wonderful Wyoming - Entering Wyoming - Drive carefully - Enjoy your trip vacation.\\" (\\"Lincoln Highway\\"). * Samson: \\"But we're over state line now. So the Nebrasky cops can't get to us. Or whoever else has a mind to.\\" (\\"Lincoln Highway\\"). * Samson: \\"There. Cheyenne.\\" / Ben: \\"That's right down the highway.\\" / Samson: \\"If you skin for it, I'll wager you'd make it in two, three hours, tops.\\" (\\"Lincoln Highway\\"). * Streetsign on Ben's route to Cheyenne: \\"Lincoln Highway - Cheyenne 53 mi. Laramie 91 mi. Rock Springs 250 mi.\\" (\\"Lincoln Highway\\"). * Streetsign where Ben heals Jonesy: \\"Cheyenne - Clean & Friendly Motor Court - 17 miles\\" (\\"Lincoln Highway\\"). but the episode is misleadingly called \\"Lincoln Highway, UT\\" on DVDs.

The locomotives operate push-pull trains with coaches of type I11, as well as freight trains. History=Background At the beginning of the 1990s SNCB/NMBS had a requirement to renew its mainline locomotive fleet: it required fast high power passenger locomotives for intercity trains on lines between Ostend, Brussels, Liege and Eupen, as well as needing replacements for diesel locomotive classes 52, 53 and 54 which dated to the 1950s and were used on freight trains for the steel industry on the Athus-Meuse line and into Luxembourg. These requirements led to the decision to purchase a universal locomotive design. The design specifications included a minimum top speed of and capability to operate under 3 kV DC and 25 kV AC electrification.M. Squilbin, 2000 Luxembourg state rail company CFL also had a locomotive fleet dating from the 1950/60s, including electric CFL 3600s and GM-EMD diesel engined locomotives CFL 1800. The company also planned to electrify its entire network, the majority at 25 kV AC, as well as 3 kV DC. In December 1992 CFL reached an agreement to jointly procure locomotives with NMBS/SNCB, with the Belgian company leading the procurement process. The procurement specifications were published in March 1993, accepted bidders were listed in September 1993, with bids received in February 1994. On 22 December 1995 NMBS/SNCB and CFL made a joint order with ACEC-Transport (subsidiary of GEC-Alstom) for 80 units; Alstom's offer was costed at 140.5million Belgian francs per locomotive; NMBS/SNCB and CFL ordered 60 and 20 units respectively of identically specified locomotives, with deliveries beginning in 1998.Новые локомотивы компании Alstom, 1999, Железные дороги мира At the same time as the class 13 order NMBS/SNCB ordered 21 control cars of type I11 for use with the locomotives on passenger services. Traction and electrical equipment for the class (including 25 kV AC drive, asynchronous motors and GTO inverter technology) was tested on a converted Class 21 locomotive. Pantograph equipment for the class was tested on class 27 number 2719. Design and construction Input to the design came from ACEC Transport (Charleroi) designing the electrical system and undertaking project coordination, other contributors were: Alstom, Le Creusot manufacture of the first 30 bogies, the remainder by Stork RMO (Netherlands); Pauwels supplied transformers; Alstom, Onan, traction motors; the first 10 locomotives were manufactured at Alstom, Belfort, the remainder at Bombardier Transportation's factory in Belgium (La Brugeoise et Nivelles, Bruges). Faiveley (pantographs) and Knorr (brake equipment) also supplied components. The mechanical equipment was identical to the contemporary SNCF BB 36000 Astride: the main frame is constructed of corrosion resistant steel, with 6MJ crash absorbance zones at either end; the locomotive bodywork is of copper plated steel. There are two air conditioned driving cabs, and a central equipment section containing electric and pneumatic equipment, accessed by side corridors. Both primary and secondary suspension are by coil spring with shock absorbers. The transmission system uses a bogie mounted traction motor (one per axle) connected to the wheelset via a hollow shaft drive and flexible coupling, traction forces are tranmissed by low-lying rods connected to the bogie frame. Mechanical braking is by pneumatically operated disc brakes on each axle. The external design takes into account the minimisation of pressure pulses when passing other trains. The electrical system differs from the SNCF BB 36000 Astride locomotives: current collection is via one of two pantographs, one used for AC electrification supply, the other for DC supply. Under 25 kV AC the supply voltage is stepped down by a transformer with four 1375 kW 1520 V secondary windings for traction; the traction supply is actively rectified using a pulse chopper circuit. Under 3 kV DC electrification the supply voltage is regulated by a chopper to 2200 V, producing the same intermediate DC supply voltage as when under 25 kV AC electrification. The intermediate DC link powers four individual three phase GTO-based, heat pipe cooled inverters (one per traction motor); the traction motors are force cooled four pole, three phase asynchronous machines (4FXA4-559B) rated at 1280 kW. The electrical system allows regenerative braking, except under 1.5 kV DC electrification, under which the locomotives operate at reduced power. An additional transformer winding supplies 600-800 kW at 1520 V for head end power (heating), there are also 150 kW, 380 V, 50 Hz and 15 kW, 110 V DC auxiliary supplies. The locomotives were designed to work in multiple, and in push-pull mode. Safety systems relevant to the countries of operation were fitted. Introduction and operations Initial introduction (1998-9) revealed a number of problems relating to electromagnetic interference with signalling and track circuits on introduction of the trains. High levels of electromagnetic noise due to resonance when operating near SNCF BB 15000 or DB Class 181 locomotives in Luxembourg initially caused restriction to single unit working. In Belgium the locomotives were unable to be operated on DC supply due to high levels of 50 Hz harmonics. In France high noise current levels were observed. By June 2000 the locomotive were able to operate in push-pull mode with I11 coaches, beginning operation on the InterCity G (Ostend-Antwerp) service, and by June 2001 were also operating InterCity A services, sleeper services (TAA) between Brussels and Luxembourg, as well as freight trains between Liege and Luxembourg. NMBS/SNCB's order was completed by October 2001. In December 2002 locomotives of the class began to operate commercial services at their top speed of 200 km/h on InterCity A trains Leuven and Liege. Other ones started to replace other engines on freight trains ; they were staple power on the newly-electrified Athus-Meuse line, electrified in 25 Kv AC. The SNCB M6 double decker coaches were also used with the class 13; in some cases the trains used two control cars, with a class 13 locomotive in the middle, a train formation nicknamed dromadaire (camel).Sources: * Class 18 locos took most of the passenger duties of Class 13 locomotives; replacing more of them in freight service. Currently, the freight engines belong to Lineas while a handful of Class 13 are used on IC trains between Brussels and Luxembourg.

Agostino Busti (or Bambaia) (c. 1483 – 11 June 1548) was a High Renaissance Italian sculptor. Busti was born in Busto Arsizio in northern Italy. Busti probably began his training with the sculptor and architect Benedetto Briosco. He and his brother's applications in 1512 for sculptural work at the workshop of the Milan Cathedral are the first biographical documents available. Vasari considered him a pupil of the painter and architect Bernardino Zenale, stressing the pictorial quality of his work. It is difficult to establish attribution and a timeline for Bambaia's output. The earliest work usually attributed to him is a marble monument in 1513 for the funeral of the Milanese poet and humanist Lancino Curzio. It was modeled on a funeral stele, and included allegorical and mythological figures but no religious reference. In his early years, his most demanding commission was probably the monument to the French general Gaston de Foix, which had been requested by the French rulers of Milan. Begun no later than 1517, the project was never completed due to the political difficulties of the city's rulers, who abandoned Milan in 1522. Busti worked on a number of tombs and monuments in his life including those of Gian Marco, Zenone Birago, Mercurio Bua, Giovanni Antonio Bellotti, Marino Caracciolo, Canon Giovanni Vimercati, and Saint Evasius. He died in Milan in 1548. References * * Fiorio, Maria Teresa. \\"Bambaia [Busti, Agostino].\\" Grove Art Online; retrieved August 11, 2007.

It was originally advertised as the A.19 Thermopylae after the famous clipper ship, being an enlarged version of the Saro Cutty Sark. Development When tests to improve the power of the Saro A.17 Cutty Sark by adding a third de Havilland Gipsy II engine proved impractical (due to the additional weight on the small airframe), Saro designed a larger aircraft on similar lines that could indeed carry three Gipsy II engines. Although a technically successful aircraft and nearly viceless in service, it was a type with a very limited market and only two were built. Production aircraft * A.21/1, prototype first flown at Cowes 16 October 1930, registered ZK-ABW for delivery to Dominion Airways of New Zealand. Aircraft sold in September 1931 to Matthews Aviation of Melbourne, Victoria and placed on the Australian register as VH-UPB. Between January 1933 and February 1934 operated a regular Bass Strait passenger service between Melbourne and Launceston, Tasmania via King Island. On 13 May 1936 it was damaged beyond repair when blown ashore at King Island while on a charter with a party of game hunters. The hull was salvaged and ended its days as an instructional airframe in Melbourne during the Second World War before being demolished. * A.21/2, first and only production example, completed July 1931. After modifications (addition of auxiliary winglet over engines to improve air flow and lift), it was sold to Francis Francis as G-ABJP, who onsold it in September to Gibraltar Airways for the Gibraltar-Tangier route. In July 1932, it was sold to The Hon Mrs Victor Bruce and named City of Portsmouth. The undercarriage was temporarily removed, and during August 1932, it was used in three attempts to break the world flight-refuelled endurance record. That was not achieved, and in May 1935, the aircraft was sold to Jersey Airways, being taken out of service in 1938.Lewis (1970) Specifications (A.21/2 Amphibian)See alsoNotesReferences *Lewis, Peter. 1970.

Biography After leaving the City College of New York, Sperling entered the film industry by working at Paramount's Astoria Studios as a shipping clerk. He later became a personal secretary for Darryl F. Zanuck and Hal Wallis at Warner Bros. in 1931.https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/29/obituaries/milton-sperling- screenwriter-is-dead-at-76.html After Zanuck resigned his position as Head of Production of Warner Bros. studios in 1933 and was offered a position with Twentieth Century Pictures (later merged with Fox Pictures), Sperling became an assistant to Edward Small, an independent film producer who released his Reliance Pictures and Edward Small Productions through United Artists. Sperling learned as much about an independent low-budget film production unit as he had about high-budget major studio films from Zanuck and Wallis at Warner Bros.. Zanuck hired Sperling for his combined 20th Century Fox, where Sperling's first screenplay Sing, Baby Sing was released in 1936. Sperling later did more screenwriting, credited and uncredited, for 20th Century Fox, becoming a film producer in 1941, with his first productions being Sun Valley Serenade then I Wake Up Screaming, both in 1941. Though now working for Fox, in 1936, Sperling was introduced to Harry Warner's (of the Warner brothers) 16-year-old daughter Betty Warner. This match was arranged by Betty Warner's older sister, Doris. After an on-and-off relationship of three years, Betty and Sperling married on July 13, 1939.Sperling, Cass Warner, and Cork Millner. \\"Celluloid Dreams.\\" Hollywood Be Thy Name: The Warner Brothers Story.

In 1941, Sperling was an associate producer on the US Marine Corps Technicolor romantic military film comedy To the Shores of Tripoli and quickly filmed a new ending, showing John Payne hearing the news about the attack and reenlisting in the Marines. Sperling also enlisted in the Marines with orders to attend Military Intelligence school but still had a couple of films to complete before leaving the studio. The US Marine Corps used Sperling's film expertise by assigning him to the US Marine Corps Photographic Unit, where he produced the documentaries The Battle for The Marianas (1944) and the Technicolor To the Shores of Iwo Jima (1945), filmed up front with the Marines in their Pacific Island campaigns, where several combat cameramen lost their lives shooting the footage. Returning from the war, Zanuck offered Sperling his old job back but father-in-law Harry Warner told Sperling that a member of the family should not work for a rival studio. offering him an independent production unit where he could make the films he wanted.Sperling, Cass Warner, Millner, Cork, and Warner Jr, Jack Hollywood Be Thy Name Prima Publishing (1994) After World War II, the major studios were looking at studios that only financed and released films such as United Artists and Monogram Pictures and decided that hiring stars, directors, and film crews on a picture-by-picture basis would be more economical, especially with the problems with the trade unions the major studios were having.Puttnam, David The Undeclared War Harper Collins Publishers (1997) Sperling named his company \\"United States Pictures\\" with his first of 14 films released under the label being Cloak and Dagger. Sperling contributed to the screenplays on several of these films, including The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell (1955) that was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Writing, Story and Screenplay. Sperling also produced other films not under the United States Pictures label such as Top Secret Affair (1957), filmed in England, and Marjorie Morningstar (1958). The final United States Pictures film was Battle of the Bulge, filmed in Spain in 1965. Sperling later produced a Spanish made \\"spaghetti western\\" with Lee Van Cleef in the role of Captain Apache (1971), then several television movies until his death by cancer in 1988.

Blassingame. Published in 1972, it is one of the first historical studies of slavery in the United States to be presented from the perspective of the enslaved. The Slave Community contradicted those historians who had interpreted history to suggest that African-American slaves were docile and submissive \\"Sambos\\" who enjoyed the benefits of a paternalistic master–slave relationship on southern plantations. Using psychology, Blassingame analyzes fugitive slave narratives published in the 19th century to conclude that an independent culture developed among the enslaved and that there were a variety of personality types exhibited by slaves. Although the importance of The Slave Community was recognized by scholars of American slavery, Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, and sources were heavily criticized. Historians criticized the use of slave narratives that were seen as unreliable and biased. They questioned Blassingame's decision to exclude the more than 2,000 interviews with former slaves conducted by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s. Historians argued that Blassingame's use of psychological theory proved unhelpful in his interpretation. Blassingame defended his conclusions at a 1976 meeting of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History and in 1979 published a revised and enlarged edition of The Slave Community. Despite criticisms, The Slave Community is a foundational text in the study of the life and culture of slaves in the antebellum South.  Historiographic background  Ulrich Bonnell Phillips wrote the first major historical study of the 20th century dealing with slavery. In American Negro Slavery (1918), Phillips refers to slaves as \\"negroes, who for the most part were by racial quality submissive rather than defiant, light-hearted instead of gloomy, amiable and ingratiating instead of sullen, and whose very defects invited paternalism rather than repression.\\"Ulrich Bonnell Phillips, American Negro Slavery: A Survey of the Supply, Employment and Control of Negro Labor as Determined by the Plantation Régime (New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1918), pp. 341–342, . American Negro Slavery is infused with racial rhetoric and upholds perceptions about the inferiority of black people common in the southern United States at the time. Although African American academics such as W. E. B. Du Bois criticized Phillips's depiction of slaves,W. E. B. Du Bois, review of American Negro Slavery, in American Political Science Review 12 (November 1918): pp. 722–726, reprinted in W. E. B. Du Bois: A Reader, ed. David Levering Lewis (New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1995), . the book was considered the authoritative text on slavery in America until the 1950s.Al- Tony Gilmore, introduction to Revisiting Blassingame's The Slave Community: The Scholars Respond, ed. Al-Tony Gilmore (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1978), pp. x–xi, . Phillips's interpretation of slavery was challenged by Kenneth M. Stampp in The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the Ante-Bellum South (1956) and Stanley M. Elkins in Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life (1958). Stampp's study lacks the racist interpretation found in American Negro Slavery and approaches the issue from the position that there is no innate difference between blacks and whites. He questions the reality of plantation paternalism described by Phillips: \\"the reality of ante-bellum paternalism ... needs to be separated from its fanciful surroundings and critically analyzed.\\"Kenneth M. Stampp, The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the Ante-Bellum South (1956; New York: Vintage Books, 1989), p. 322, . Elkins also dismisses Phillips's claim that African American slaves were innately submissive \\"Sambos\\". He argues that slaves had instead been infantilized, or \\"made\\" into Sambos, by the brutal treatment received at the hands of slaveowners and overseers. Elkins compares the process to the infantilization of Jews in Nazi concentration camps.Stanley M. Elkins, Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1958), chap. 3, . Like Phillips, Stampp and Elkins relied on plantation records and the writings of slaveowners as their main primary sources. Stampp admits that \\"few ask what the slaves themselves thought of bondage.\\" Historians dismissed the written works of slaves such as the 19th century fugitive slave narratives as unreliable and biased because of their editing by abolitionists.The few exceptions include Charles S. Sydnor, Slavery in Mississippi (New York: D. Appleton-Century Co., 1933), ; and E. Franklin Frazier, The Negro Slave Family (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1930), . Scholars also ignored the 2,300 interviews conducted with former slaves in the late 1930s by the WPA Federal Writers' Project. As historian George P. Rawick points out, more weight was often given to white sources: the \\"masters not only ruled the past in fact\\" but also \\"rule its written history.\\"George P. Rawick, From Sunup to Sundown: The Making of the Black Community (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1972), p. xiv, . The 1970s, however, witnessed the publication of revisionist studies that departed from the traditional historiography of slavery. Focusing on the perspective of the slave, new studies incorporated the slave narratives and WPA interviews: George Rawick's From Sunup to Sundown: The Making of the Black Community (1972), Eugene D. Genovese's Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made (1974), Peter H. Wood, Black Majority: Negroes in Colonial South Carolina from 1670 Through the Stono Rebellion (1974), Leslie Howard Owens's This Species of Property: Slave Life and Culture in the Old South (1976), Herbert G. Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom, 1750–1925 (1976), and Lawrence W. Levine's Black Culture and Black Consciousness: Afro-American Folk Thought from Slavery to Freedom (1977). One of the more controversial of these studies was John W. Blassingame's The Slave Community.  Blassingame's argument  In The Slave Community, Blassingame argues that \\"historians have never systematically explored the life experiences of American slaves.\\" He asserts that by concentrating on the slaveowner, historians have presented a distorted view of plantation life that \\"strips the slave of any meaningful and distinctive culture, family life, religion, or manhood.\\" Blassingame outlines that the reliance on planter sources led historians like Elkins to mimic planter stereotypes of slaves such as the \\"submissive half-man, half child\\" Sambo.John W. Blassingame, The Slave Community: Plantation Life in the Antebellum South (1972; rev. ed., New York: Oxford University Press, 1979), p. xi, . Noting the agency slaves possessed over their lives, he contends, \\"Rather than identifying with and submitting totally to his master, the slave held onto many remnants of his African culture, gained a sense of worth in the quarters, spent most of his time free from surveillance by whites, controlled important aspects of his life, and did some personally meaningful things on his own volition.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. xii.  African cultural retention and slave culture  According to Blassingame, African culture was not entirely removed from slave culture through the process of enslavement and \\"was much more resistant to the bludgeons that was slavery than historians have hitherto suspected.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, pp. 34–35. \\"African survivals\\" persisted in the form of folk tales, religion and spirituality, music and dance, and language. He asserts that the retention of African culture acted as a form of resistance to enslavement: \\"All things considered, the few Africans enslaved in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century America appear to have survived their traumatic experiences without becoming abjectly docile, infantile, or submissive\\" and \\"since an overwhelming percentage of nineteenth-century Southern slaves were native Americans, they never underwent this kind of shock [the Middle Passage] and were in a position to construct psychological defenses against total dependency on their masters.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 47. Blassingame asserts that historians have discussed \\"what could be generally described as slave 'culture,' but give little solid information on life in the quarters.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 106n2. He argues that culture developed within the slave community independent of the slaveowners' influence. Blassingame notes, \\"Antebellum black slaves created several unique cultural forms which lightened their burden of oppression, promoted group solidarity, provided ways for verbalizing aggression, sustaining hope, building self-esteem, and often represented areas of life largely free from the control of whites.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 105. Blassingame argues slave music and dance (depicted here in The Old Plantation) represented forms of resistance and examples of African cultural retention Blassingame notes that many of the folk tales told by slaves have been traced by African scholars to Ghana, Senegal, and Mauritania to peoples such as the Ewe, Wolof, Hausa, Temne, Ashanti, and Igbo. He remarks, \\"While many of these tales were brought over to the South, the African element appears most clearly in the animal tales.\\" One prominent example discussed by Blassingame is the Ewe story of \\"Why the Hare Runs Away\\", which is a trickster and tar-baby tale told by southern slaves and later recorded by writer Joel Chandler Harris in his Uncle Remus stories. Southern slaves often included African animals like elephants, lions, and monkeys as characters in their folk tales.Blassingame, The Slave Community, pp. 32, 114–130. As Christian missionaries and slaveowners attempted to erase African religious and spiritual beliefs, Blassingame argues that \\"in the United States, many African religious rites were fused into one—voodoo.\\" Voodoo priests and conjurers promised slaves that they could make masters kind, harm enemies, ensure love, and heal sickness. Other religious survivals noted by Blassingame include funeral rites, grave decorating, and ritualistic dancing and singing.Blassingame, The Slave Community, pp. 40–45, 109–114. Slaveowners and state governments tried to prevent slaves from making or playing musical instruments because of the use of drums to signal the Stono Rebellion in 1739. Blassingame, however, points out that in spite of restrictions, slaves were able to build a strong musical tradition drawing on their African heritage. Music, songs, and dances were similar to those performed or played in Africa. Instruments reproduced by slaves include drums, three-stringed banjos, gourd rattles, and mandolins.Blassingame, The Slave Community, pp. 36–39, 108–109. Still, Blassingame concludes that cross-cultural exchanges occurred on southern plantations, arguing that \\"acculturation in the United States involved the mutual interaction between two cultures, with Europeans and Africans borrowing from each other.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 20. Blassingame asserts that the most significant instance revolved around Protestant Christianity (primarily Baptist and Methodist churches): \\"The number of blacks who received religious instruction in antebellum white churches is significant because the church was the only institution other than the plantation which played a major role in acculturating the slave.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 98. Christianity and enslaved black ministers slowly replaced African religious survivals and represented another aspect of slave culture which the slaves used to create their own communities. While ministers preached obedience in the presence of the slaveowners and other whites, slaves often met in secret, \\"invisible\\" services unsupervised by whites. In these \\"invisible churches\\", slaves could discuss freedom, liberty, and the judgment of God against slaveowners.Blassingame, The Slave Community, pp. 130–148.  Slave families  Slave marriages were illegal in southern states, and slave couples were frequently separated by slaveowners through sale. Blassingame grants that slaveowners did have control over slave marriages. They encouraged monogamous relationships to \\"make it easier to discipline their slaves. ... A black man, they reasoned, who loved his wife and his children was less likely to be rebellious or to run away than would a 'single' slave.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 151. Blassingame notes that when a slave couple resided on the same plantation, the husband witnessed the whipping and raping of his wife and the sale of his children. He remarks, \\"Nothing demonstrated his powerlessness as much as the slave's inability to prevent the forcible sale of his wife and children.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 174. Nevertheless, Blassingame argues that \\"however frequently the family was broken it was primarily responsible for the slave's ability to survive on the plantation without becoming totally dependent on and submissive to his master.\\" He contends: Blassingame asserts that slave parents attempted to shield infants and young children from the brutality of the plantation. When children understood that they were enslaved (usually after their first whipping), parents dissuaded angry urges to run away or seek revenge.Blassingame, The Slave Community, pp. 183–190. Children observed fathers demonstrating two behavioral types. In the quarters, he \\"acted like a man\\", castigating whites for the mistreatment of himself and his family; in the field working for the master, he appeared obedient and submissive. According to Blassingame, \\"Sometimes children internalized both the true personality traits and the contradictory behavioral patterns of their parents.\\" He believes that children recognized submissiveness as a convenient method to avoid punishment and the behavior in the quarters as the true behavioral model.Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 190. Blassingame concludes, \\"In [the slave father's] family, the slave not only learned how to avoid the blows of the master, but also drew on the love and sympathy of its members to raise his spirits. The family was, in short, an important survival mechanism.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 191.  Personality types  Blassingame identifies three stereotypes in the literature of the antebellum south: *Sambo was a combination of the Uncle Remus, Jim Crow, and Uncle Tom figures who represented the faithful, submissive, and superstitious slave. *Jack worked faithfully until he was mistreated, then he became uncooperative and occasionally rebellious. Rationally analyzing the white man's overwhelming physical power, Jack either avoided contact with him or was deferential in his presence. *Nat was the perpetual runaway and rebellious slave feared by slaveowners. Named after Nat Turner, the Nat character retaliated against slaveowners and was subdued and punished only when overcome by greater numbers.Blassingame, The Slave Community, pp. 224–225 Directly challenging Elkins's infantilization thesis, Blassingame argues that historians have focused too much on the Sambo personality type and the role of paternalism.Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 226n4. \\"The Sambo stereotype was so pervasive in antebellum Southern literature that many historians, without further research, argue that it was an accurate description of the dominant slave personality.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 226. Blassingame argues that the loyal and devoted slave was less common than historians previously believed According to Blassingame, the Sambo figure evolved from white Americans' attitudes toward Africans and African Americans as innately barbaric, passive, superstitious, and childlike. Southern writers felt a need to defend slavery from allegations of abuse and brutality leveled by northern abolitionists, so Sambo became a common portrayal to justify and explain the need for plantation paternalism. Finally, slaveowners used the Sambo stereotype to alleviate their own fears and anxieties about the potential rebelliousness of their slaves.Blassingame, The Slave Community, pp. 227–230. Blassingame remarks, \\"In this regard, Nat, the actual and potential rebel, stands at the core of white perceptions of the slave. With Nat perennially in the wings, the creation of Sambo was almost mandatory for the Southerner's emotional security. Like a man whistling in the dark to bolster his courage, the white man had to portray the slave as Sambo.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 230. Despite slaveowner paternalism and charges of submissiveness, Blassingame contends, \\"There is overwhelming evidence, in the primary sources, of the Negro's resistance to his bondage and of his undying love for freedom.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 192. Blassingame outlines efforts of slaves to run away and rebel, particularly the Stono Rebellion of 1739, Charles Deslondes's revolt in 1811, Nat Turner's revolt of 1831, and the participation of fugitive slaves in Florida fighting with Seminoles during the Seminole Wars.Blassingame, The Slave Community, chap. 5. Blassingame concludes that the Sambo and Nat stereotypes \\"were real.\\" He explains, \\"The more fear whites had of Nat, the more firmly tried to believe in Sambo in order to escape paranoia.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 233. Blassingame concludes that there were a variety of personality types exhibited by slaves positioned on a scale between the two extremes of Sambo and Nat. He argues that variations present in plantations, overseers, and masters gave the slave \\"much more freedom from restraint and more independence and autonomy than his institutionally defined role allowed. Consequently, the slave did not have to be infantile or abjectly docile in order to remain alive.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 249. Blassingame compares slavery on southern plantations to the treatment of prisoners in Nazi concentration camps in an effort to demonstrate that \\"the most important factor in causing infantilism, total dependency, and docility in the camps was the real threat of death which left few, if any, alternatives for the inmates.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 330. He remarks, \\"Placed on a continuum of total institutions, the concentration camp is far removed from the Southern plantation.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 331. According to Blassingame, the goal of the irrationally organized and understaffed plantation was not the systematic torture and extermination of its laborers, who were \\"worth more than a bullet\\".  Methodology and sources  Blassingame based The Slave Community on the autobiographies of former slaves, such as Frederick Douglass's My Bondage and My Freedom (1855) In The Slave Community, Blassingame uses psychologist Harry Stack Sullivan's interpersonal theory to interpret the behavior of slaves on antebellum plantations. Sullivan claims that \\"significant others\\", persons with the most power to reward and punish individual behavior, were primarily responsible for determining behavior. Interpersonal theorists argue that \\"behavioral patterns are determined by the characteristics of the situation, how the person perceives them, and his behavioral dispositions at the time.\\" The most important component of personality is self-esteem. Blassingame explains, \\"Our sense of self-esteem is heightened or lowered by our perception of the images others have of us.\\" Interpersonal behavior revolves around the dominant-submissive axes: \\"One form of behavior tends to elicit its complement: dominance leads to submission and vice versa. The extent of submissiveness often depends on the structure of the group to which the person belongs.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, pp. 284–285. Another psychological theory used by Blassingame is role theory. According to this theory, \\"a person's behavior is generally determined by the socially defined roles or the behavioral patterns expected of him in certain situations.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 243. Blassingame asserts that through applying interpersonal and role theory to the fugitive slave narratives, historians can determine \\"the extent to which slaves acted the way their masters expected them to behave\\" and how the Sambo, Jack, and Nat personality types can be misleading.Blassingame, The Slave Community, pp. 242–243. Blassingame contends that historians have \\"deliberately ignored\\" autobiographies of ex-slaves, particularly the fugitive slave narratives. \\"Consequently\\", argues Blassingame, \\"a great deal of emphasis has been placed on non-traditional sources in this study in an effort to delineate more clearly the slave's view of bondage and to discover some new insights into the workings of the system.\\" He relies heavily on narratives by Henry Bibb, Henry Clay Bruce, Elizabeth Keckley, Samuel Hall, Solomon Northup, Charles Ball, Jermain Wesley Loguen, William Wells Brown, John Brown, Robert Anderson, William Grimes, Austin Steward, and Frederick Douglass.See footnotes in Blassingame, The Slave Community, chap. 8, and the \\"Critical Essay on Sources\\", pp. 367–374. Blassingame's discussion of the African slave trade, Middle Passage, and African culture is based on Olaudah Equiano's The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African (1794).Blassingame, The Slave Community, chap. 1. Rather than accepting the fugitive slave narratives without question, Blassingame admits to scrutinizing his reading of the texts. He notes that arguments against the use of these autobiographies used by historians revolve around reliability: \\"Many historians refuse to use these accounts because they have felt the fugitive, as the primary sufferer in the institution, was unable to give an objective account of bondage.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 370. Still, Blassingame defends his reliance on autobiographies, noting, \\"The portrait of the institution of slavery which emerges from the narratives is not the simple picture of hell on earth that most historians have led us to believe they contain. Instead, the fugitives' plantations are peopled with the same range of heroes and villains, black and white, which one generally finds in the human race.\\" Therefore, Blassingame concludes: Besides fugitive slave narratives, Blassingame uses abolitionist periodicals such as The Liberator, National Anti-Slavery Standard, Pennsylvania Freeman, Anti-Slavery Bugle, and Genius of Universal Emancipation. According to Blassingame, these periodicals printed slave interviews, letters, and autobiographies, but \\"gave even more coverage to white Southerners than to slaves and frequently reprinted articles, letters, and proceedings from a large number of Southern newspapers\\".Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 378. A primary source that Blassingame did not consult in his study was the WPA slave interviews. While he admits that \\"slave interviews rival autobiographies in their revelations about the internal dynamics of bondage, ... the heavy editing of the WPA interviews makes them far more difficult to utilize than black autobiographies.\\"Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. 375. He elaborates on his criticism of the interviews in a 1975 article in the Journal of Southern History. He describes how white interviewers often deleted material contrary to the paternalistic image of the antebellum South which they wanted to present. Blassingame concludes, \\"Uncritical use of the interviews will lead almost inevitably to a simplistic and distorted view of the plantation as a paternalistic institution where the chief feature of life was mutual love and respect between masters and slaves.\\"John W. Blassingame, \\"Using the Testimony of Ex-Slaves: Approaches and Problems\\", Journal of Southern History 41 (November 1975): p. 490. Blassingame builds on the historiography of Phillips, Stampp, and Elkins, but he acknowledges the influence of Charles S. Sydnor's Slavery in Mississippi (1933), Orville W. Taylor's Negro Slavery in Arkansas (1958), Eugene D. Genovese's The Political Economy of Slavery (1961), and Ann J. Lane's anthology of essays The Debate Over Slavery: Stanley Elkins and His Critics (1971).Blassingame, The Slave Community, pp. 380–381.  Reception and influence  The importance of The Slave Community as one of the first studies of slavery from the perspective of the slave was recognized by historians. The book nonetheless received heavy criticism by academics who disagreed with Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, and sources.For an overview of the reviews of The Slave Community, see Mary Frances Berry, \\"The Slave Community: A Review of Reviews\\", in Gilmore, ed., Revisiting Blassingame's The Slave Community. Historian George P. Rawick noted in 1976, however, that the criticism \\"should not obscure the fact that [Blassingame's] book was of such merit as to warrant spending our time criticizing it four years after its publication. Yet, like many good books, it should have been better.\\"George P. Rawick, \\"Some Notes on a Social Analysis of Slavery: A Critique and Assessment of The Slave Community\\", in Gilmore, ed., Revisiting Blassingame's The Slave Community, p. 26.  Criticism  In The History Teacher, Keith Polakoff comments that \\"only with the publication of Blassingame's work do we obtain for the first time a detailed examination of the daily lives of the slaves on large plantations, with some intelligent speculation about the forces to which they were subjected.Keith Polakoff, review of The Slave Community, in The History Teacher 6 (August 1973): pp. 638–639. David Goldfield writes in Agricultural History that the book was the most impressive and balanced attempt to understand the slave's responses to plantation life to date.David Goldfield, review of The Slave Community, in Agricultural History 47 (July 1973): pp. 227–228. Carl N. Degler writes in the Washington Post that Blassingame's study comes \\"closer than any previous study to answering the question 'what was it like to be a slave?'\\"Carl N. Degler, review of The Slave Community, in \\"Bookworld\\", Washington Post, October 15, 1972. Still, Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, and sources received substantial criticism from historians. Marian DeB. Kilson's review in the American Historical Review described Blassingame's aims as \\"imperfectly realized\\" because he \\"lacks a clear analytical perspective\\". She found his discussion of slave personality types \\"fascinating\\" and \\"his methodological aims ... important\\" but \\"not systematically pursued\\". Kilson believes that Blassingame ultimately failed in his analysis because \\"his intellectual integration of social and psychological orientations has yet to be fully achieved.\\"Marian DeB. Kilson, review of The Slave Community, in American Historical Review 78 (October 1973): pp. 1132–1133. Orville W. Taylor contends in the Journal of Negro History that Blassingame had a tendency to overgeneralize and make \\"unsubstantiatable claims to originality and uniqueness\\".Orville W. Taylor, review of The Slave Community, in Journal of Negro History 58 (October 1973): pp. 470–471. In the Journal of Political Economy, economic historian Stanley L. Engerman complains that the book is not \\"written by or for economists\\" and makes \\"limited use of economic analysis\\". He continues, \\"Given the concern with the 'personal autonomy' and culture of the slave, much of the book is devoted to the African heritage; to slave music, religion, and folklore; and to the discussion of the slave family and other personal relationships.\\" Engerman concedes that The Slave Community \\"is a book written at a time of transition in the interpretation of slavery and black culture\\", but \\"the author at times seems unsure of the direction in which he is pointing.\\" He concludes that Blassingame's \\"analysis is incomplete in its presentation of a different and more complex scene\\" even though he \\"effectively shows the difficulties of the concentration-camp image and the Sambo myth\\".Stanley L. Engerman, review of The Slave Community, in Journal of Political Economy 81 (November–December 1973): pp. 1476–1477. Historians criticized Blassingame for dismissing the WPA slave interviews and relying solely on fugitive slave narratives. In the Journal of American History, Willie Lee Rose writes that Blassingame's use of the fugitive slave narratives is marred by his neglect of the WPA interviews.Willie Lee Rose, review of The Slave Community, in Journal of American History 60 (June 1973): pp. 131–133. Kenneth Wiggins Porter regards Blassingame's dependence on printed sources as a \\"major weakness\\" and believes he does not use enough white sources like plantation records and travel narratives, particularly Frederick Law Olmsted's account of life in the antebellum South.Kenneth Wiggins Porter, review of The Slave Community, in Journal of Southern History 39 (May 1973): pp. 293–294. According to George Rawick, \\"We desperately need work that depicts and analyzes the lives of black women under slavery. We have had very largely a male-dominated literature about slavery.\\" He notes, \\"Blassingame, unfortunately, does not help us at all in this task.\\" Rawick surmises that if Blassingame had consulted the WPA slave interviews, he would have developed a picture of the \\"heroic struggles of black women on behalf of themselves and of the whole black community\\".Rawick, \\"Some Notes on a Social Analysis of Slavery\\", pp. 21, 22. Historians exhibited varying responses to Blassingame's use of psychological theory. In a review in the William and Mary Quarterly, George Mullin is especially critical of Blassingame's use of psychology, stating that Blassingame \\"reduc[es] slave behavior and culture to a question of roles and psychological characteristics\\". He concludes that an \\"E. P. Thompson for the American Black community during slavery is still off-stage\\", and that the topic needs exploration by a social or economic historian.George Mullin, review of The Slave Community, in William and Mary Quarterly 30 (July 1973): pp. 513–516. Rawick states that Blassingame's \\"first major error lies in adopting the very questionable deterministic social psychological role theories associated with ... Irving Goffman and Henry Stack Sullivan.\\" He complains that it \\"parodies the basic complexity of the 'psychology' of the oppressed who simultaneously view themselves in socially negative terms while struggling against the view of themselves and their behavior\\". Rawick is convinced that Blassingame would have reached the same conclusions from the sources without the use of psychology \\"because the historical evidence as seen through an unadulterated commitment to the struggles of the slaves and an equally uncompromising hostility to the masters would have led him there.\\"Rawick, \\"Some Notes on a Social Analysis of Slavery\\", pp. 24, 25. On the other hand, Eugene D. Genovese and Earl E. Thorpe praised Blassingame for his use of psychological theory, but admit they prefer Freudian and Marxist interpretations over Sullivanian theory.Eugene D. Genovese, \\"Toward a Psychology of Slavery: An Assessment of the Contribution of The Slave Community\\", in Gilmore, ed., Revisiting Blassingame's The Slave Community.Earl E. Thorpe, \\"The Slave Community: Studies of Slavery Need Freud and Marx\\", in Gilmore, ed., Revisiting Blassingame's The Slave Community.  Influence  In 1976, the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History met in Chicago and held a session on The Slave Community. Panelists included Mary Frances Berry, Herbert Gutman, Leslie Howard Owens, George Rawick, Earl Thorpe, and Eugene Genovese. Blassingame responded to questions and critiques from the panel. The discussion led to the publication of an anthology edited by Al-Tony Gilmore called Revisiting Blassingame's The Slave Community: The Scholars Respond (1978). The book includes essays by the panelists as well as James D. Anderson, Ralph D. Carter, John Henrik Clarke, and Stanley Engerman. Blassingame's essay, \\"Redefining The Slave Community: A Response to Critics\\" appears in the volume.Gilmore, introduction, Redefining Blassingame's The Slave Community, pp. xiii–xiv. Since its publication in 1972 and revision in 1979, The Slave Community has influenced subsequent historiographical works on slavery in the United States. In a 1976 edition of Roll, Jordan, Roll, Eugene Genovese explains that Blassingame's book \\"demonstrates that the published accounts of runaway slaves can be illuminating\\".Eugene D. Genovese, Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made (1972; New York: Vintage Books, 1976), p. 675, . The authors of Reckoning with Slavery (1976) use Blassingame's findings to challenge the assertions of Robert William Fogel and Stanley Engerman in Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery (1974).Paul A. David, Herbert G. Gutman, Richard Sutch, Peter Temin, and Gavin Wright, Reckoning with Slavery (New York: Oxford University Press, 1976), pp. 47, 128, 169–170, 236, . In Slave Religion: The \\"Invisible Institution\\" in the Antebellum South (1978), Albert J. Raboteau comments, \\"We should speak of the 'invisibility' of slave religion with irony: it is the neglect of slave sources by historians which has been the main cause of this invisibility.\\" Raboteau credits Blassingame and others for demonstrating the value of slave sources.Albert J. Raboteau, Slave Religion: The \\"Invisible Institution\\" in the Antebellum South (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1979), p. x, . Historian Charles Joyner's influential study Down by the Riverside: A South Carolina Slave Community (1984) is reinforced by the findings of The Slave Community and relies on similar evidence.Charles Joyner, Down by the Riverside: A South Carolina Slave Community (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1984), pp. 273, 284, 285, 301, and 307, . Historian Deborah Gray White builds on Blassingame's research of the family life of the slaves in Ar'n't I a Woman?: Female Slaves in the Plantation South (1985). Her argument is similar to Blassingame's: \\"This present study takes a look at slave women in America and argues that they were not submissive, subordinate, or prudish and that they were not expected to be so.\\"Deborah Gray White, Ar'n't I a Woman?: Female Slaves in the Plantation South (New York: W. W. Norton, 1985), p. 22, . White discusses the Mammy and Jezebel stereotypes often applied to African American women by white Americans. She calls The Slave Community \\"a classic\\" but remarks that \\"Blassingame stressed the fact that many masters recognized the male as the head of the family. He observed that during courtship men flattered women and exaggerated their prowess. There was, however, little discussion of the reciprocal activities of slave women.\\" She concludes that Blassingame \\"described how slave men gained status in the family, but he did not do the same for women.\\"White, Ar'n't I a Woman?, p. 21. Elizabeth Fox- Genovese makes similar observations in Within the Plantation Household: Black and White Women of the Old South (1988). She notes that The Slave Community, like other historiography produced in the 1960s and 70s, \\"did not directly address women's history, even though many of the historians were sensitive to women's experience. Most of the male authors had done a large part of their work before the development of women's history as a discipline, and even the most sensitive were hampered by a paucity of sources and by unfamiliarity with the questions feminists would soon raise.\\"Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, Within the Plantation Household: Black and White Women of the Old South (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1988), p. 405n20, .  Revised edition  After the 1976 Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History meeting and the publication of Revisiting Blassingame's The Slave Community in 1978, Blassingame produced a revised and enlarged edition of The Slave Community in 1979. In the new preface, Blassingame asserted that the book had to be revised because of George Bentley, an enslaved, pro-slavery Primitive Baptist minister from Tennessee who pastored a white church in the 1850s. Blassingame wanted to \\"solve the myriad dilemmas posed by George Bentley\\", but he also wanted to answer the questions, challenges, and critiques raised by scholars since the publication of The Slave Community.Blassingame, The Slave Community, pp. vii–ix. Blassingame explains that he incorporated the suggestions published in Revisiting Blassingame's The Slave Community \\"without long protestation or argument\\".Blassingame, The Slave Community, p. ix. The most significant changes made to the text involve further discussion of African cultural survivals, slave family life, slave culture, and acculturation. Blassingame added a chapter titled \\"The Americanization of the Slave and the Africanization of the South\\" where he draws parallels between the acculturation of African American slaves in the American South, African slaves in Latin America, and European slaves in North Africa and the Ottoman Empire. He compares the conversion of slaves in the southern states to Protestant Christianity, European slaves in North Africa to Islam, and African slaves in Latin America to Catholicism.Blassingame, The Slave Community, chap. 2.For a summary of changes in the revised edition, see Gary B Mills, review of The Slave Community, in Journal of Southern History 47 (February 1981): pp. 113–114. Blassingame addresses the historiography of slavery published between 1972 and 1978 in the revised edition. For instance, he challenges Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman's economic and statistical study of slavery in Time on the Cross. Blassingame writes: Reviewing the revised edition in the Journal of Southern History, Gary B. Mills suggests, \\"All controversy and revision aside, The Slave Community remains a significant book, and the author's position that the bulk of both slaves and slaveowners lay between the stereotyped extremes proves durable. Their exact location on a scale of one to ten will always remain a matter of opinion.\\"Mills, review of The Slave Community, p. 114.

Schwan (7 August 1915 - 17 March 2005) was a biomedical engineer and biophysicist, recognized as the \\"founding father of biomedical engineering.\\" He was born in Aachen, Germany, and died in his home Radnor, Pennsylvania. Biography Schwan was born from a science-influenced family. His father Wilhelm Schwan was a science and mathematics teacher, and mother Meta was a physics teacher. He invariably excelled in physics and mathematics and graduated from gymnasium (German high school) at Göttingen in distinction in 1934. He continued to study mathematics, physics, and engineering in Göttingen, and then biophysics in Frankfurt. He received Ph.D. degrees in physics and biophysics in 1940 and 1946 from the University of Frankfurt-am- Main. He was with the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics in Frankfurt from 1937 to 1947. In 1947 he emigrated to America, where he joined the University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine. Professional Achievements During his career Schwan did much to improve the emerging field of biomedical engineering, developed its first Ph.D. program, and produced more than 300 technical papers and gave countless lectures. He is best known for many biophysical studies related to electrical properties of cells and tissues, and on non-thermal mechanisms of interaction of fields with biological systems. He innovative works include the large low-frequency dielectric dispersion that is found in biological material, and electrically induced forces on cells. He was the pioneer in recognizing the possible health hazards of non-ionizing electromagnetic fields. He proposed a safe limit for human exposure to microwave energy of 100 W/m2 (based on thermal analysis) to the U.S. Navy in 1953, which became the basis for the present IEEE C95.1 safety standards used in the western world. Awards and Honors Schwan received the 1962 Philadelphia Section Achievement Award of the Institute of Radio Engineers, the 1967 W. J. Morlock Award of the IEEE, the 1974 Boris Rajewsky Prize for Biophysics, the 1980 U.S. Senior Scientist Award of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. He was a Fellow of the IEEE and the AAAS. He received the 1983 IEEE Edison Medal, and is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and a Foreign Scientific Member of the Max Planck Society. In 1985 he was awarded the first d'Arsonval Award of the Bioelectromagnetics Society. The Herman P.

Art Clemens' sandpainting career blossomed during his summer vacations from the State School, when he would spend time honing his craft. He would collect naturally colored grains of sand from an area in Pikes Peak State Park known as Pictured Rocks. At Pictured Rocks, the basal portion of the sandstone near the Sand Cave is naturally colored by iron and mineral staining.\\"Stop 5: Bridal Veil Falls , Discussion of Andrew Clemens Sand Art, Geological Society of Iowa. Retrieved 11 August 2007. Clemens separated the sand grains into piles, by color, and used them to form the basis for his art. Sand bottle by Andrew Clemens, 1879 To create his art he inserted the presorted grains of sand into small glass drug bottles using homemade tools formed out of hickory sticks and florists wire. His process utilized no glue and pressure from the other sand grains alone held the artwork together. When Clemens completed a sand bottle he sealed the bottle with a stopper and wax. At first, Clemens' work was simple and geometric in nature, diamond shaped patterns against an ivory white background was a regular motif in his earliest work. His technique improved gradually and eventually people wanted to buy his work, which now included overtones, shading and complex designs such as landscapes. He created most of his work between 1880–1886 and is acknowledged as the inventor and possibly the sole practitioner of his art form.Dewey, Susan. \\"Scenic sandscapes merit close inspection,\\" Historical Treasures Article, 19 September 1999, Vigo County Historical Society; Indiana State University.

He created many of his images upside down. Upon completion, Clemens would securely stopper the bottle, and flip it right side up. The most complex of his designs could take up to a year to complete. When he was 17 (in the summer of 1874) Andrew Clemens advertised his sand bottles in the North Iowa Times, McGregor, Iowa. Andrew returned to McGregor to live year-round after a fire at the State School for the Deaf destroyed the dorm where he had lived. Andrew had been offered a job as a teacher there, but declined the offer. Clemens showed his work at the Saint Paul Dime Museum in 1889. He earned an invitation to demonstrate his work at the 1893 Chicago Columbian Exposition, which he declined due to his failing health.\\"McGregor Sand Artist,\\" originally published: The Palimpsest May 1945 Vol. XXVI, No. 5, Republished 1996 Iowa State Historical Dept., Division of the State Historical Society: 1996, (Google Books link).

All children born on a space station were given names with the same initial, hence the names Kemlo, Kartin, Kerowski, Krillie, and so on. Kemlo was a Captain of the Space Scouts, who had their own \\"scooters\\" - small two-seat personal spacecraft for travel around and between the Satellite Belts.

India's first Port Trust Board was established for Calcutta Port in 1870, following passage of the Bombay Port Trust Act in 1879. Similar Boards were set up in Madras in 1905. The administration of Port Trust Boards were brought under national government in 1963 with legislation to enable the declaration of \\"major ports\\" with ownership of adjacent public land on the foreshore and seabed All ports previously established under different Acts were brought within the purview of this newly enacted law. Board membership Besides representatives of the Central Government, the 1963 Act provides for trustees representing (1) labour employed in the port – a minimum of two representatives; (2) ship owners; (3) owners of sailing vessels; (4) shippers; and (5) such other interests, which in the opinion of the Central Government, ought to be locally represented. In practical terms, autonomy for the board of trustees is nominal. Central Government has overriding powers. Until the early 1990s, trade union leaders representing labour employed in the port were routinely nominated to the board of trustees. However the advent of containerisation significantly reduced the stevedore workforces at major seaports. As a result, labour representation on the various Port Trusts has more recently been filled by civil servants drawn from among the permanent government employees carrying out services and administration functions.

Early career She was born Berta Lynn Springbett in Wainwright, Alberta, and studied ballet in Vancouver, British Columbia. In 1953, she was auditioned by Frederick Ashton and given a scholarship to London's Sadler's Wells Ballet School. There she was in a class with Antoinette Sibley and Marcia Haydée. In 1956, she joined Covent Garden Opera Ballet, then moved to the Touring Royal Ballet in 1957 and a year later to the main company of the Royal Ballet as a soloist dancer, becoming a principal in 1959. Her first created role was the Adolescent in Kenneth MacMillan's The Burrow (1958), one of many ballets on which she worked with this choreographer. Her lyrical technique, her unconventional style and the very intense dramatic powers were developed through the wide range of roles he made on her including The Girl in The Invitation (1960) and The Fiancé in Le baiser de la fée (1960). She soon debuted in the classics by dancing Odette-Odile (1958, on tour in Australia), Giselle and Aurora (both 1960) and was the Young Girl in Ashton's comedy ballet The Two Pigeons (1961) in which she began a much praised partnership with Christopher Gable. International fame and choreography The title role in MacMillan's Romeo and Juliet, which was created on her in 1965 although danced by Margot Fonteyn at the première, established her as the leading dance-actress of her generation. She was prima ballerina at Berlin Opera Ballet (1966–69) under MacMillan's direction, where she danced the first performance of his Concerto, whose second movement was inspired by her, and created the role of Anna Anderson in the one-act version of Anastasia (1967). She guested with various companies including London Festival Ballet, London Contemporary Dance Theatre, National Ballet of Canada, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and American Ballet Theatre. She worked with different choreographers from Antony Tudor and Jerome Robbins to Lar Lubovitch and Roland Petit and was often partnered by Rudolf Nureyev (La Sylphide, Raymonda and others). With Nureyev she improved her technique by attending the class of Danish teacher Stanley Williams. From 1971 to 1978, she returned to the Royal Ballet as a guest artist with new MacMillan characters such as the title role in the three act version of Anastasia (1971) and Mary Vetsera in Mayerling (1978, with David Wall as Crown Prince Rudolf). Ashton created for her a very successful solo called Five Brahms waltzes in the manner of Isadora Duncan (1975) and the role of Natalia Petrovna in A Month in the Country (1976, with Anthony Dowell as Beliaev). She was herself a choreographer, creating her first ballet Night Ride (mus. Michael Finnissy) for the Royal Ballet Choreographic Group in 1973. Her other works include Gladly, Sadly, Badly, Madly for LCDT (mus. Carl Davis, 1975), Intimate Letters for Galina Samsova (mus. Janáček, 1978), Wolfie for Rambert Dance Company (mus. Mozart, 1987) and Bastet for Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet (mus. Michael Berkeley, 1988). Directorship and subsequent career She was artistic director of Munich State Ballet (1978–80) where she invited a young William Forsythe, then she briefly returned to the Royal Ballet before retiring (1981) and working there subsequently as occasional coach. She appeared as an actress in the Herbert Ross 1987 movie Dancers with Mikhail Baryshnikov and in Wittgenstein by Derek Jarman (1993) playing the part of Ballets Russes's Lydia Lopokova; she came back to the stage with a number of cameo roles: in Gillian Lynne's A Simple Man with Northern Ballet Theatre (1987), in Escape at Sea with Second Stride (1993) and with Adventures in Motion Pictures in Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake (1996) and Cinderella (1997) in which she originated the role of the Stepmother. In 1989, at the invitation of Peter Schaufuss of the English National Ballet, she came out of retirement to dance for the first time Tatiana in John Cranko's Onegin in London and again the title role of MacMillan's Anastasia in New York. In 2006-07, she worked in Athens as artistic director of the Greek National Ballet. She was created a CBE in 1976 and won the Evening Standard Drama Award the following year. Named in honour of her, the Lynn Seymour Award for Expressive Dance is annually held at the Royal Ballet School. Private life Seymour married three times and had three children: twin boys by a Polish dancer whom she did not marry, and a son by her second husband.

The project was approved by the United States Forest Service (USFS) in July 2010, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in January 2009 and the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) in December 2008. SDG&E; states that the long 230/500 kilovolt power line will bring 1000 megawatts of renewable energy from the Imperial Valley to San Diego County. The cost of the project is estimated to be $1.9 billion for construction. SDG&E;, which will receive a guaranteed profit of over $1.4 billion from the construction of the line, claims that the power line is necessary to support future growth of the San Diego region, and its economic benefits to the region will measure on the order of $100 million per year. However, the project has been called one of the most controversial projects ever proposed. Construction began in December 2010 and the line was energized in June 2012. https://www.elp.com/articles/2012/07/sdg-e-dedicates-sunrise-powerlink- transmission-line.html In constructing the line, 30,000 helicopter flight hours were used. Construction In June 2012, major construction activities on the Sunrise Powerlink Project were completed. The line was energized on June 17, following a prolonged testing and completion phase. The overhead portion of the Sunrise Powerlink is proceeded on schedule with the construction of towers and tower foundations in Eastern San Diego County and Imperial County. Work is also progressed on the new Suncrest Substation, which is a critical facility for the project. Upgrades to the existing San Luis Rey, Encina and Imperial Valley substations were also completed. The underground portion of the line through Alpine also progressed with the installation of vaults under Alpine Boulevard. The vaults allow for the installation of the 230-kilovolt electrical cable and provide access for maintenance of the cable connections. Workers have also installed cable, which is fed into a manhole and \\"pulled\\" by a special machine through underground conduits. The USFS issued a Record of Decision on July 13, 2010 that allows for a segment of the line to be built through the Cleveland National Forest. http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/jul/13/sunrise-powerlink-approved- cleveland-national-fore/ The Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) within the U.S. Department of the Interior issued a decisionhttp://www.oha.doi.gov/IBLA/findingIBLA.html on May 14, 2010 rejecting the appeal filed by Backcountry Against Dumps (BAD) and other East County organizations. BAD sought to reverse the BLM's approval of the line. \\"Because Backcountry has failed to establish any error of law or fact in the Record of Decision, we will affirm BLM's decision to approve the granting of Rights-of- Way to SDG&E; for an electrical transmission line and related activity for the Sunrise Powerlink Transmission Project,\\" the ruling stated. The IBLA concluded that the BLM decision was consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. On December 9, 2010 ground was broken in Boulevard, California to mark the start of construction on the project's first tower. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the ground breaking ceremony, along with several other local government leaders. During the ceremony, Schwarzenegger said the Sunrise Powerlink project should serve as an example to the nation of how to build green infrastructure. \\"We are well on our way to be an example for the rest of the nation, especially when it comes to infrastructure,\\" Schwarzenegger said. Key Documents Final Project Modification Report: On May 14, 2010, SDG&E; submitted the Final Project Modification Report (PMR)http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/Environment/info/aspen/sunrise/sunrise.htm to the CPUC and the BLM. The PMR fine-tunes the approved route and enhances the environmental preservation and protection components of the transmission line. These changes were made in order to minimize impacts to sensitive resources, accommodate landowners where possible and reduce engineering constraints. Highlights of the PMR include: *More than 40 poles and structures eliminated *Access roads reduced by , or nearly 60 percent, through increased use of helicopters for construction and maintenance *Permanent impacts to sensitive vegetation communities reduced by *Impacts to Quino Checkerspot Butterfly habitat reduced by a minimum of 58 percent *Temporary impacts to Peninsular Bighorn Sheep habitat decreased by an average of 86 percent and permanent impacts decreased by an average of 74 percent *Temporary and permanent impacts to U.S. and state waters reduced by 88 percent Final Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement: The Sunrise Powerlink Final Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement was filed on October 13, 2008.http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/environment/info/aspen/sunrise/toc- feir.htm Key Regulatory Findings The project has generated much controversy since its conception, primarily due to questions concerning whether the line is necessary. However, it has been approved by all three major regulatory agencies that have jurisdiction over the project: the CPUC, BLM and USFS. In its final decision, the CPUC voted 4-1 on Dec. 18, 2008 to approve that the Sunrise Powerlink. Both the CPUC administrative law judge and the presiding commissioner assigned to the proceeding recommended against approval. The federal Bureau of Land Management approved the project on January 20, 2009. Renewable Energy SDG&E; has stated that the line is intended to carry renewable energy generated by the sun, wind and geothermal sources.California ISO Board Approves Sunrise/GreenpathTransmission Project http://www.caiso.com/1847/1847bb8a57f70.pdf In its 4-1 decision to approve the line, the CPUC stated that the Sunrise Powerlink will facilitate the development of Imperial Valley renewable energy projects capable of generating 1,900 megawatts of clean power.Sunrise Powerlink Final Decision http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PUBLISHED/AGENDA_DECISION/95357.htm#P263_8685.

However, in a dissenting opinion, CPUC Commissioner Dian Grueneich stated that the application should be denied for the following reasons: (1) It is not needed to meet SDG&E;'s renewable portfolio standard (RPS)obligation of 20% by 2010;(2) Assuming a 20% RPS, it is not economic and will potentially generate significant ratepayer costs; (3) It will have many significant and unmitigable impacts on the environment; and (4) Other alternatives will meet SDG&E;'s eventual reliability needs more economically and with fewer significant and unmitigable impacts on the environment.http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/efile/ALT/93073.pdf SDG&E; is not legally obligated to carry any renewable energy on the line.CPUC website, http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/NR/rdonlyres/0D666D07-B64D-4DB2-A3E1-6D27DBF27D4D/0/powerlink_dissent.pdf In response to that concern, SDG&E; President & CEO Debra Reed stated in testimony before the commission that the utility would make three voluntary commitments if Sunrise is approved. She stated that SDG&E; would: (1) not contract, for any length of term, with conventional coal generators that deliver power via Sunrise, (2) replace any currently approved renewable energy contract deliverable via Sunrise that fails with a viable contract with a renewable generator located in Imperial Valley, and (3) voluntarily raise SDG&E;'s renewable energy goal to 33 percent by 2020.Sunrise Powerlink Final Decision http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PUBLISHED/AGENDA_DECISION/95357.htm#P2877_450757 (SDG&E; was the first investor-owned utility in California to make this commitment.) According to the Renewable Energy Transmission Initiative, east San Diego County, along with neighboring Imperial County and Northern Baja California, has a potential aggregate generating capacity of roughly 6,870 megawatts (MW) for solar energy, 3,495 MW for wind power and 2,000 MW for geothermal energy. Together, these renewable resources could potentially produce enough electricity to power 8 million homes at noon, on a sunny day, if the wind was turning windfarm turbine rotors at their theoretical maximum speed. Given Southern California capacity factors, however, of 28% for solar and 30% for wind, production at the quoted capacity would average one-third of that, or enough to power 2,666,000 homes.RETI Phase 2A Final Report, September 2009 http://www.energy.ca.gov/2009publications/RETI-1000-2009-001/RETI-1000-2009-001-F-REV2.PDF This will help meet several state and federal policies and mandates for the increased use of green energy, including: *President Obama's New Energy for America Plan:New Energy for America Plan Fact Sheet, This plan seeks to ensure that 25 percent of the country's electricity comes from renewable sources by 2025. Roughly $6.5 billion included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is intended to provide tax relief and other incentives to develop the infrastructure necessary to move renewable energy from rural production areas to urban markets. *California Renewables Portfolio Standard:CPUC Web site, RPS page, http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/energy/Renewables/ This mandate requires utilities to provide at least 20 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2010. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed an executive order raising this threshold to 33 percent by 2020.Governor Schwarzenegger Advances State's Renewable Energy Development http://gov.ca.gov/press-release/11073/ *California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32):AB32 language, http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/docs/ab32text.pdf This requires the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. A study by the University of San Diego identified increased use of renewable energy as the most effective means of reducing energy-related GHG emissions in the region. Public Involvement Public involvement during the public participation period of the project is a source of significant controversy. Community groups state that SDG&E; failed to notify the public about the southern route which was ultimately selected by the CPUC. SDG&E; contends they performed all notifications as required by law, and that the project's environmental impact report included the southern route as one of the nine alternatives being considered. The CPUC later confirmed these statements.http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/Environment/info/aspen/sunrise/alpine_fact_sheet.pdfhttp://www.cpuc.ca.gov/Environment/info/aspen/sunrise/lakeside_fact_sheet.pdfhttp://www.cpuc.ca.gov/environment/info/aspen/sunrise/feir/001%20exec_summary_FINAL.pdf However, during this same period, SDG&E; testified before the CPUC that the southern route was not feasible. The media and public hearings therefore focused on the northern route through Anza Borrego State Park, and opponents of the project claimed there was no media or public focus on the possible southern routes. While the CPUC did not refute the claim that there was not media or public focus on the southern route, the CPUC has stated that the legally required notifications occurred. SDG&E; was required to notify property owners within of the proposed route. After the last public participation hearing held by the CPUC in February 2008, SDG&E; notified the CPUC and that the southern route was feasible. In October 2008, the CPUC fined SDG&E; over $1.1 million for misleading the CPUC about the feasibility of the southern route. However, there were no subsequent CPUC public participation hearings in San Diego for the residents along the southern route. The CPUC approved the southern route in December 2008. After the approval of the route, SDG&E; held workshops in communities along the route, where they were criticized by community members who stated that were just learning about this route for the first time. Those critical of the lack of notification included the Lakeside Planning Group.http://www.sdcounty.ca.gov/dplu/docs/PG/LA090218MI.pdf However, the CPUC provided proof that the Lakeside Planning Group received all documentation and notification, however, this notification occurred during the time in which SDG&E; was stating in public testimony that the southern route was not feasible. The CPUC confirmed that no current members of the planning group provided comment. The CPUC and SDG&E; state that they have held numerous workshops and community meetings to gather input and feedback on the Sunrise Powerlink. Community groups contend that the community meetings were not held until after the project was approved. The Final Environmental Impact Report documents the public involvement process, which included public meetings throughout the approval process, although none of those meetings were held in the impacted community of Lakeside. The most recent phase of the post-approval public involvement process is a series of Community Council meetings. SDG&E; has created seven Community Councils along the route that give the public the opportunity to provide input and feedback on the permitting and construction of the Sunrise Powerlink. Members, who live and work in the communities they represent, are being encouraged to share what they learn with residents and businesses in their communities. Community Councils are being created in: Imperial Valley, Campo, Boulevard, Jacumba, Alpine, Lakeside and the City of San Diego. SDG&E; has been criticized for hand-picking community members to sit on the community councils.

One elected official is San Diego County Supervisor Dianne Jacob, who is actively opposed to the route, and has testified before the CPUC in opposition to the project.http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/environment/info/aspen/sunrise/feir/cmts/Comment%20Sets%20C0196-C0219%20Ramona%202of2+RTC.pdfhttp://www.co.san- diego.ca.us/cnty/bos/sup2/journal/journal0602.pdf The project is also opposed by a non-profit utilities watchdog group, the Utilities Consumer Action Network . UCAN, in a joint action with the Center for Biological Diversity, is challenging the CPUC's approval in the California Supreme Court.http://www.ucan.org/energy/electricity/sunrise_powerlink_faces_supreme_court_battle In addition, the project is also being litigated in federal court, by a coalition of three community groups; the Protect Our Communities Foundation , East County Community Action Coalition , and Back Country Against Dumps . These community groups are challenging the Bureau of Land Management's approval of the project on BLM land, on the grounds that the BLM failed to perform its legally required environmental reviews of the project.http://protectourcommunities.org/wp- content/uploads/2009/05/complaint_2-16-10.pdf One of the community groups in opposition to the project, the East County Community Action Coalition, was formed in March 2009 in response to the approval of the route through the east county of San Diego. The grass-roots organization states that in just one year, its membership has surged to include groups and individuals that together represent over 79,000 individuals. The coalition cites a variety of reasons for opposing the line, including the concern that the route will traverse some of the most fire prone areas of San Diego county, including the area that was burned in the 2003 Cedar Fire. The Cedar Fire is, to date, the deadliest fire in California's history, and ninth deadliest wildfire in U.S. history.http://www.epicdisasters.com/index.php/site/comments/the_ten_deadliest_us_wildfires/ The CPUC, in its final decision, stated that lower-voltage distribution lines, not high-voltage transmission lines like the Sunrise Powerlink, were responsible for most power-line related fires in the San Diego area. Further, the CPUC instituted mitigation measures to further reduce the risk of fire.Sunrise Powerlink Final Decision http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PUBLISHED/AGENDA_DECISION/95357.htm#P2499_350278 Environmental Impact Report The 11,000 page Environmental Impact Report conducted by the California Public Utilities Commission favored no transmission line as its first alternative. Instead, the report recommended a mix of energy sources, including local solar generation. San Diego County is one of the sunniest counties in the country and is a favorable venue for rooftop solar voltaic generation, as pointed out in a comprehensive report discussing various energy options for the region [footnote Bill Powers' Smart Energy Solutions report ]. The project has also generated controversy concerning the choice of route. Rather than following roads (e.g. Interstate 8) or existing transmission lines, SDG&E; originally proposed to build it in wilderness, cutting across Anza-Borrego Desert State Park and Cleveland National Forest. The route approved by the California Public Utilities Commission avoids Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, and instead traverses the Cleveland National Forest and the communities of Jacumba, Boulevard, Campo, Japatul Valley, Lyons Valley, Alpine, and Lakeside.\\"State regulators OK Powerlink\\" San Diego Union-Tribune, Dec. 19, 2008 http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2008/dec/19/1n19puc233950-state- regulators-ok-powerlink/ The U.S. Forest Service is currently considering a proposed plan amendment and Record of Decision that would allow the line to cross a section of the Cleveland National Forest.\\"CPUC Says No to New Hearing,\\" North County Times, July 14, 2009 http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2009/07/14/news/sandiego/z2ba13208691ae916882575f3007083c9.txt The project can not be built without Forest Service approval. SDG&E; has stated that the Sunrise Powerlink is expected to be in service by 2012. The project's Environmental Impact Report \\"Fire and Fuels Management\\" section lists numerous unmitigable significant impacts; known as Class 1 impacts, which are the highest level of impact that a project can have.http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/environment/info/aspen/sunrise/feir/D15%20Fire.pdf The final EIR states that, \\"San Diego County is an extremely fire-prone landscape. Winds originating from the Great Basin, locally known as Santa Anas, create extreme fire weather conditions characterized by low humidity, sustained high-speed winds, and extremely strong gusts. Santa Ana winds typically blow from the northeast over the Peninsular Range. As the air is forced through coastal mountain passes, wind speeds of can be maintained for hours with gusts from 70 to possible (Schroeder et al., 1964). Santa Ana winds create extremely dangerous fire conditions and have been the primary driver of most of California's catastrophic wildfires. Because of the presence of dense, dry fuels and periodic Santa Ana winds, southern California has been characterized as having one of the most fire-prone landscapes in the world. The Final EIR cites the following unmitigable impacts: Wildland firefighters working around energized power lines are exposed to electrical shock hazards including: direct contact with downed power lines, contact with electrically charged materials and equipment due to broken lines, contact with smoke that can conduct electricity between lines, and the use of solid-stream water applications around energized lines. Between 1980 and 1999 in the U.S., there were 10 firefighter fatalities due to electrical structure contact during wildfire suppression (NFPA, 2001). Maintaining a minimum safety buffer greatly reduces the risk of electrical structure contact, and it also reduces the effectiveness of ground-based frontal attacks. The presence of the overhead transmission line would reduce the effectiveness of firefighting (Class I) - Aerial and ground-based firefighting efforts would be compromised by the introduction of an overhead transmission line due to the introduction of various hazards as identified in the Containment Conflict Model results, including increasing the risk of transmission line contact by aircraft or water buckets, creating indefensible landscapes, and obstructing historical fire containment boundaries. The outcome of not fighting a wildfire in an otherwise defensible landscape under favorable weather conditions is that it is able to build in size and intensity unchecked by firefighters who are forced to wait until the fire passes through the area. Delays in containment allow for rapid fire perimeter growth. With the increase in the fire perimeter comes the potential for wind-blown embers to ignite spot fires ahead of the fire front, which further complicates fire suppression activities. Impact F-2: Presence of the overhead transmission line would increase the probability of a wildfire (Class I)- The presence of the overhead transmission line would create an ongoing source of potential wildfire ignitions for the life of the project. Line faults can be caused by such unpredictable events as conductor contact by floating debris, gunshots, and helicopter collisions; these events are rare but would be unavoidable. Impact F-2 is considered a significant impact because certain ignition sources are unavoidable. Due to the potential for unavoidable ignitions related to the presence of the overhead transmission line to occur during extreme fire weather, the presence of the project would significantly increase the likelihood of a catastrophic wildfire (Class I). The risk of ignitions and the risk of damage from a project-related ignition can be reduced, though not to a level that is less than significant. Impact F-3: Presence of the overhead transmission line would reduce the effectiveness of firefighting. (Class I)- Aerial and ground-based firefighting efforts would be compromised by the introduction of an overhead transmission line due to the introduction of various hazards as identified in the Containment Conflict Model results, including increasing the risk of transmission line contact by aircraft or water buckets, creating indefensible landscapes, and obstructing historical fire containment boundaries. The outcome of not fighting a wildfire in an otherwise defensible landscape under favorable weather conditions is that it is able to build in size and intensity unchecked by firefighters who are forced to wait until the fire passes through the area. Delays in containment allow for rapid fire perimeter growth. With the increase in the fire perimeter comes the potential for wind-blown embers to ignite spot fires ahead of the fire front, which further complicates fire suppression activities.\\" In addition, numerous environmental groups believe that construction of the power line, as well as the power line itself, will be harmful to the environment, will cost ratepayers more than better alternatives, and will actually add more greenhouse gases than it will save. The Draft Environmental Impact ReportDraft Environmental Impact Report finds that several alternatives would be better for the environment than the Sunrise Powerlink. However, the Environmental Impact Report itself is only one factor officials use in deciding the overall merits of a project. The Sunrise Powerlink EIR states that, \\"This EIR/EIS does not make a recommendation regarding the approval or denial of the project. It is purely informational in content, and will be used by the CPUC and BLM in considering whether to approve the Proposed Project or any of the alternatives analyzed in this EIR/EIS.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Official SDG&E; Sunrise Powerlink web site * Protect Our Communities Foundation * People's Powerlink.org * Sunrise Powerlink Helicopter Operations * Community Alliance for the Sunrise Powerlink * Smart Energy 2020 Plan - 2nd edition * San Diego Smart Energy Campaign * San Diego Smart Energy 2020 report * Sunrise Powerlink Observations * East County Community Action Coalition * Back Country Against Dumps Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 2012 Category:Energy infrastructure in California ","title":"Sunrise Powerlink"},{"id":"12722744","text":"\\"Whirlyball 7\\"\\" is a split EP released in May 2007, featuring songs from four bands from Atlanta, Georgia.

He also struck the 'Rosa Americana' coins of British America during the same period. Wood's coinage was extremely unpopular in Ireland, occasioning controversy as to its constitutionality and economic sense, notably in Jonathan Swift's Drapier's Letters. The coinage was recalled and exported to the colonies of British America. Subsequently, Wood developed a novel but ineffective means of producing iron, which he exploited as part of a fraudulent investment scheme. Family life William Wood was born in Shrewsbury, son of Francis Wood, a silkweaver.See . His family were supposedly descendants of Huguenots named Dubois who had fled France after the St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre in 1572.Letters: Mary Howitt. The Times, Tuesday, 7 February 1888; pg. 8; Issue 32302; col B. William married Margaret Molineaux in 1690, daughter of Willenhall ironmonger Richard Molineaux. The couple lived in a large house in Wolverhampton, The Deanery, where they raised 14 children. Career=Ironmonger After his marriage William Wood entered into a partnership as a manufacturing ironmonger in Wolverhampton with his father-in- law, Richard Molyneux. Later in 1723 his two brothers-in-law, the Dublin ironmongers John and Daniel Molyneux, disclaimed all connection with the coinage of William Wood. However, little is known of his trade. Ironmaster In 1715, William Wood 'took two important steps away from his prosperous anonymity and down a road which led eventually to infamy and ruin. The first was his application for the receiver-generalship of the land tax for the neighbouring county of Shropshire, and the second his formation of a large partnership for the production and marketing of iron and steel in the Midlands and London.' Effectively he was attempting to profit from the crushing Whig victory in 1714. In 1714, he had entered into a partnership with Thomas Harvey and others at Tern Mill, a brass and iron mill close to Tern Hall (now Attingham Park), with the intention of obtaining further ironworks. They built Sutton Forge, at Sutton by Shrewsbury, and with Charles Lloyd of Dolobran, Bersham Furnace. They also had for a time furnace at Esclusham Above and Ruabon. In 1717, he became a partner in building a blast furnace at Rushall, where there was at least an intention to use coke as fuel, then a comparatively novel idea. In 1720, Wood issued a prospectus for erecting 'a company for manufacturing iron copper brass etc.', The Present State of Mr Wood's Partnership. He probably hoped to profit from share dealing. Harvey wanted to buy Wood's shares and have his own business back. Wood offered to buy Harvey's, but did not offer enough. Harvey accepted shares in the new company. He also agreed to sell his potwork at Gardden at Rhosllannerchrugog and shares in the White Grit and Penally lead mines on the Stiperstones for £17100. By 1723, Wood also had the Falcon Iron Foundry at Southwark, where he placed his son William in charge.Flinn (1961-2), p. 56. Harvey went unpaid for several years and had to seek help from his fellow Quaker Joshua Gee, whose son Joshua married Harvey's daughter, leading to litigation against William Wood, his sons William and Francis and son-in-law William Buckland (as guarantors). This ultimately led to several ironworks being returned to Harvey. Wood's share of Ruabon Furnace was purportedly transferred to Daniel Ivie in satisfaction for the non-delivery of iron. He broke into the house at Gardden, occupied by John Hawkins the clerk there, and had to be removed by a constable, but Hawkins (who was arrested) had to get himself removed to London by habeas corpus in 1731 to answer proceedings. Ivie seems to have operated there until 1737, while Hawkins became managing partner for a firm involving some of the Coalbrookdale ironworks partners at Bersham ironworks. Wood's halfpence Wood's Irish halfpence coin, obverse and reverse. 'Rosa Americana' halfpence, struck for circulation in the Thirteen Colonies Wood hoped to make a profit producing coins for use in Ireland and America. During the first half of 1722 the king's mistress, the Duchess of Kendal, obtained a patent from the Earl of Sunderland for coining copper money for Ireland. This was a means of providing her with something to live on after the death of the king. Wood thought this would be a profitable enterprise so he purchased the royal patent from the duchess for £10,000. In his indenture from George I dated 16 June 1722, Wood was authorized to produce up to 360 tons of halfpence and farthings for Ireland at 30 pence to the pound over a period of fourteen years for an annual fee of £800 paid to the king. These Hibernia coins, which were minted in Phoenix Street, Seven Dials, London, from January 1722, were heavier than the coppers then circulating in Ireland. They were certainly less profitable for Wood to mint than his lighter weight Rosa Americana issues (Hibernias weighed sixty halfpence to the pound as compared to 120 Rosa Americana halfpence to the pound). When including the costs of production and the £10,000 fee paid to the Duchess of Kendal, P. Mossman has calculated Wood would have lost £4,871 over the fourteen years of the patent. Thus from Wood's standpoint the Hibernia coin specifications were too generous based on the cost of production, fuelling speculation that Wood intended to make good his shortfall by debasing or even counterfeiting his own coins. Wood's coinage was extremely unpopular in Ireland. The Anglican archbishop of Dublin, William King, was an early critic of the copper coinage scheme, arguing as early as July 1722 that its introduction would lead to an outflow of gold and silver coins from the kingdom. The Commissioners of the Irish Revenue similarly argued that there was no shortage of halfpence and farthings in Ireland, and a large influx of copper coins would be prejudicial to the country's commerce and the royal revenue. The Parliament of Ireland sent an address to the king in September 1723 protesting against the coins' introduction, citing the danger of inflation and of legal tender (gold and silver) coinage flowing out of Ireland as well as the \\"Clandestine and Unpresedented manner\\" in which Wood had obtained his patent. Open letters, ballads, pamphlets, and puppet shows denounced or mocked Wood's coinage. Jonathan Swift attacked the coinage in a widely circulated series of pseudonymous Drapier's Letters. Swift objected to the secretive way this patent had been given to a private individual in England, rather than to the Irish authorities (who were not consulted in the matter); to the officiousness of Robert Walpole in defending the patent; and to the high-handed way that the wishes of Ireland's parliament and public opinion were set aside. Swift claimed that Ireland would be defrauded of much of the silver and gold in circulation on the grounds that Wood's coins were of inferior quality and could easily be forged.Jonathan Swift, Drapier's Letters III. The controversy was not quelled when assays carried out by Sir Isaac Newton, at that time Master of the Mint, showed that the copper in the coins he assayed \\"was of the same goodness and value with that which was coined for England.\\" Irish pamphleteers, including Swift, pointed out that Wood himself had selected the coins for Newton to test and that Wood would not be able to turn a profit without debasing the coins actually bound for Ireland. The controversy turned increasingly into a larger debate about Ireland's constitutional status and the rights of the Irish Parliament and people. As a result of the popular agitation against the coins, Wood's halfpence and farthings were ultimately recalled. As compensation for the loss of his patents, Wood was granted a pension of £3000 a year for eight years, although he only received this for three years before his death on 2 August 1730.Hibernia Coppers 1722-1724: Introduction The famed blind Irish harper Turlough O'Carolan (1670 – 25 March 1738) wrote a tongue-in-cheek celebration of this failure, titled \\"Squire Wood's Lamentation on the Refusal of his Halfpence\\".Sheet music for Turlough O'Carolan's \\"Squire Wood's Lamentation on the Refusal of his Halfpence\\" Patent iron-making venture While working at Lee Hall in Bellingham, Northumberland, his son Francis devised a means of making iron with mineral coal, which he patented in 1727.English Patent no. 489. In 1723, Thomas Baylies on behalf of Wood had agreed an iron ore mining lease in Frizington Parks, near Whitehaven. In May 1728, he sought to exploit the patent for iron-making processes invented by his son Francis, which he re- patented himself.English Patent no. 502. He financed this by contracting to supply a large quantity of iron to the United Company of Mines Royal and Mineral and Battery Works, who advanced money (or rather saleable shares) with which Wood erected works on Frizington Moor. The works were 375 feet long and 36 feet wide, with 11 furnaces, three horsemill-powered forges and engines for grinding coal and iron ore. Wood was secretive over what was achieved. Sir John Meres of the United Company of Mines Royal (etc.) asked James Lowther of Whitehaven to find out what was happening. The reports that Lowther obtained from his agent John Spedding indicated the works were experiencing difficulty, with the result that the Company delayed instalments of what they were to advance. The company never received more than some 10 tons of Wood's iron. Having failed to secure finance from the Mines Royal Company, Wood wanted to incorporate the \\"Company of Ironmasters of Great Britain\\", with a capital of £1,000,000, but it was feared this would prove to be a vehicle for stockjobbing. This led to an investigation by the Privy Council, at which point William Wood died. The government provided £500 to build furnaces by the high road to Chelsea, so that the promoters could demonstrate the process. Wood, two of his sons, William and Charles, his son-in-law William Buckland, and Kingsmill Eyre were the petitioners in this. A trial of the process in the presence of John Hanbury, Sir James Lowther, and the Earl of Hay took place in November 1731. The iron produced was then tried by blacksmiths in the presence of Privy Council clerks. The smiths gave the opinion that the iron required more work than common redshort iron and was weaker when cold. This adverse report was the end of efforts to have a company chartered. Kingsmill Eyre took out a patent for a similar process in his own name in 1736. In this, scrap iron was added to the charge, which made the iron less bad. He tried to revive the Frizington works, but nothing came of this and he was declared bankrupt in May 1738.Flinn (1961-2) Posterity William's son John obtained £2000 from his father for handing back a share in Francis' patent, though he had some difficulty in getting it paid. He set up Wednesbury Field Forge in 1740, where he made iron from scrap. He patented a process for making pig iron malleable in 1761 and, with this brother Charles in 1762, a similar process, the earlier form of that known as potting and stamping. This was an important advance in the conversion from pig iron to bar iron. William’s son Charles Wood was involved in the discovery of platinum. He built Low Mill Forge, near Egremont, where he conducted experiments for the potting and stamping process, which he patented with John. He built the Cyfarthfa Iron foundry in Glamorgan, for Anthony Bacon and William Brownrigg, recording events in a diary (Gross 2001). Francis was engaged at Ember Mill in Thames Ditton when he was declared bankrupt in October 1732, as was William Wood junior. Charles and his brother- in-law William Buckland followed in 1733. Charles was the grandfather of the noted Victorian writer Mary Howitt. She published a history of the family, Some Reminiscences of my Life, in the journal Good Words.Mary Howitt (1886). \\"Some reminiscences of my Life.\\" Good Words. William was also an ancestor of the poet Armine Kent and the architect Arthur Blomfield.

It tended to specialize in underground or alternative manga, but has had its share of major hits as well. The magazine started in 2000 as spin-off of Shogakukan's Big Comic Spirits and became a standalone monthly magazine in 2003. In 2009, Viz Media launched an online English version of Monthly Ikki, named SigIkki, which serialized various titles from the magazine. Monthly Ikki ceased publication in 2014. History Editor Hideki Egami was working in the editorial department of Shogakukan's Weekly Big Comic Spirits for 18 years. Egami realized that although the weekly manga magazine is the standard in Japan, the manga was getting more sophisticated, and he thought that some manga artists would do better as creators of monthly series rather than weeklies, as weekly serialized creators tend to use lots of assistants and is a very fast-paced work stream. On the other hand, he considered that monthly manga artists are more likely to do more of the work on their own, or with very few people assisting them, taking time for a more thoughtful approach to create their stories. Egami decided to create a monthly magazine, as a spin-off of Weekly Big Comic Spirits. The magazine started in 2000, titled , and thirteen issues were released from November 30, 2000 to December 25, 2002. Ikki became a standalone monthly magazine in 2003, with its first issue, the April 2003 issue, released on February 25. In 2009, Viz Media launched an online English version of Monthly Ikki, named SigIkki. Egami stated that the original pages of the magazine in Japan were digitized, and deciding on how to use this material, the first thing he thought was on translating it in English to reach a wider audience. The website serialized various titles from Monthly Ikki online, and then, when a title proved to be popular it received publication in graphic novel form. It also included interviews with the Japanese creators and editors. In January 2013, Ikki Paradise, the official website of the magazine, launched the web manga corner , which serialized manga specifically made for the web for free to readers. In July 2014, the September issue of Monthly Ikki announced that it would cease publication after 14-year run, with the November 2014 issue, released on September 25, 2014, being the last one. Some series, which were running in the magazine at the time, finished with the last issue, while others were transferred to other magazines. The magazine would be replaced by Hibana, which started with its April 2015 issue, released on March 25, 2015. Hibana ceased publication after 2-year run, with the September 2017 issue, released on August 7, 2017, being the last. Style Monthly Ikki was considered an underground magazine, and it focused mainly on the creativity of the authors rather that the expectation of the audience, as Egami stated: \\"At the time we were founding IKKI, my boss told me that with Weekly Comic Spirits, we have to see the ocean for the sea, meaning that you have to see the audience or the readers' point of view. But for IKKI, you have to see the spring that is the origin of the river, meaning you have to see the creator and work with the creator; that it's important to understand the artists' point of view\\". Egami said that the slogan of the magazine was \\"We are still at the dawn of the manga era\\", explaining: \\"The spirit of this tagline is that the dawn is still approaching; meaning that if you assume that the history of manga will continue for 200 years or longer, we are still at the very beginning. Even though some people think that the manga market is saturated, that it is mature and sophisticated, we believe that there is still a lot more that can be done in the manga world\\". The content of the magazine has also been compared to the American/European alternative comics. To discover artists who would join the magazine, they looked for creators who worked for other magazines or publishers, and to look for new artists, they held a newcomers contest. Saturn Apartments Hisae Iwaoka and I'll Give It My All... Tomorrows Shunju Aono were artists discovered through the newcomers content. Circulation and demographic In 2009, the magazine had 13,750 copies in circulation. In 2010, the numbers dropped to 11,500 copies in circulation. Some series from the magazine, like Bokurano: Ours and Rideback, received anime adaptations, which helped to increase the tankōbon volume sales of those series, but did not affect that much the sales of the magazine itself. Monthly Ikki was a seinen manga magazine, aimed at older teens and young adult readers, however, Egami stated that they were not trying to focus on the gender or age of their readers, unlike most of the Japanese manga industry, and the magazine was \\"for everybody\\". Egami said that most of their audience was in their twenties, and there also was a younger group of readers who ranged from older teens to an older audience, some who were up to 50's. 40% of Monthly Ikki's readers were female, something unusual for a seinen manga magazine, and regarding the teen readers, 60% were girls. Egami said that in every age, gender or group are people with creative minds who could understand the concepts presented in their series, and Monthly Ikki was trying to reach that specific type of reader. Egami also stated that they were not intentionally trying to make series equally appealing to both men and women readers, and titles like House of Five Leaves, which was popular with female readers, \\"just happen[ed] to be popular with female readers\\".

The website and its content are provided mainly in English. It relies on a combination of voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephony, session recording, instant messaging, file sharing and an interactive whiteboard. The company mainly provides academic help by paid subscription to students in subjects such as English, Mathematics, Statistics and Science. TutorVista's operations are entirely located in India, but most of its market is abroad. TutorVista's online tutorial platform connects students with about 2,000 teachers across India, United States, UK, Australia, China, Middle East and South East Asia. TutorVista is reachable through computers, tablets, and mobile phones. History TutorVista was founded in the year 2005 by the duo Krishnan Ganesh and Meena Ganesh. Other formation contributors included Srinivas Anumolu, Louise Kumar, and Ravi Kannan. In 2006, Sequoia Capital India and Light speed Venture Partners invested more than $10 million in TutorVista. The company expanded with the acquisition of Edurite, an educational firm in 2007, and a partnership with American Book Company in 2009. In 2011, Pearson increased its smaller stake to a 76 percent majority stake in TutorVista for $127 million and fully acquired it by buying the remaining 20 percent stake in 2013. At this point, Krishnan Ganesh and Meena Ganesh stepped down from all management roles in the Bangalore-based company and Srikanth Iyer was appointed the new CEO.  Acquisitions and investments  * TutorVista had acquired Edurite, an education solutions provider, in 2007. * Pearson acquired a 17 percent stake in TutorVista from Bengaluru-based entrepreneur-investor couple K Ganesh and Meena Ganesh in 2009. * In January 2011, it purchased another 59 percent holding for Rs 577 crore before increasing its controlling stake to 80 percent shortly after. * Two years later, Pearson acquired the remaining 20 percent. * TutorVista, founded by serial entrepreneur K Ganesh in 2005, was bought by Pearson in a multi-million (around Rs. 1000 crore) deal across several years which was completed in 2013. * Bengaluru-based edutech company BYJU'S acquired the online education ventures of TutorVista and Edurite from the world's biggest learning company Pearson in June 2017. Criticism The Economist has suggested that building trust for an unknown Indian brand was the biggest difficulty faced by the company. There have also been several protests in the United States against those organizations that do not allow face-to-face and personalized tutoring. Officials and parents from both local and national bodies have mixed reactions regarding the ethical and practical implications of this trend. In the UK, it is estimated that 1 in 4 students is now tutored outside school, with offshore tutoring companies increasingly entering the market.

Its release came shortly before the band appeared at a concert at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham, in the presence of the Prince of Wales, and the resulting publicity probably helped to send it to an entry position of No. 1 in the album chart, making it their fourth and last No. 1 album. Nevertheless, it received a lukewarm reception from fans. \\"Dear John\\", the first single and the only track not written by any of the band, reached No. 10 in the UK, but \\"She Don't Fool Me\\" stalled at No. 36. 1982 was the 20th anniversary of band members Francis Rossi and Alan Lancaster first meeting each other, and the sum of the numbers 1+9+8+2 is 20 (shown as the Roman numerals 'XX' underneath the album title), hence the name of the album.

It is not to be confused with the National Counterterrorism Center, which is a separate entity. From 2006, the Director of the Counterterrorism Center was Michael D’Andrea, who was publicly referred to only as \\"Roger\\". Foundation and early years The Counterterrorist Center was established in February 1986, under the CIA's Directorate of Operations, with Duane Clarridge as its first director. It was an \\"interdisciplinary\\" body; many of its personnel, and most its chiefs, were drawn from the CIA's Directorate of Operations, but others came from the Directorates of Intelligence and Science and Technology. Observing that terrorism knew no geographical boundaries, the CTC was designed to cut across the traditional region-based bodies of the CIA. Discredited by the Iran-Contra scandal of 1986, the original aims later gave way to a more analytical role. This did not prevent the Center contemplating an \\"Eagle\\" drone aircraft project in 1986-7, which could have been used to spy on hostage-takers in Lebanon. The idea was unrealistic in terms of the technical abilities of the time, but can be compared to the Predator drone eventually inaugurated in 2000.Steve Coll, Ghost Wars (2005 edn), pp. 137–46, 527–8; 9/11 Commission Report, chapter 3, pp. 75, 92 (HTML version).

Besides branches specializing in Lebanon's Hezbollah, and secular groups like the Japanese Red Army, another concentrated on Sunni Islamist radicalism, primarily in Algeria.Coll, Ghost Wars (2005 edn), pp. 252–3. In January 1996, the CTC opened the Bin Laden Issue Station to track Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda, with Michael Scheuer, formerly in charge of the CTC's Islamic Extremist Branch, as its first head. The reasons were similar to those for the establishment of the CTC itself. The new Station, unlike the traditional country-based ones, was not geographically limited, and drew its personnel from across the U.S. intelligence community. J. Cofer Black, CTC Director 1999–2002 Geoffrey O'Connell was Director of the CTC from 1997 until Cofer Black became Director in June 1999, as part of a reshuffle by CIA chief George Tenet, who was embarking on a plan to deal with al-Qaeda. At the same time Tenet made one of his executives Richard Blee head of the unnamed section in charge of the Bin Laden Station. Paul Pillar became chief of analysis in 1993, and by 1997, he was the Center's deputy director. But in summer 1999 he suffered a clash of styles with Cofer Black. Soon after, Pillar left the CTC.Coll, Ghost Wars (2005 edn), pp. 257, 375, 451, 457. He was replaced as deputy director by Ben Bonk. Henry Crumpton was head of operations in the late 1990s,Tenet, At the Center of the Storm, pp.*; cf. Coll, Ghost Wars (2005 edn), p. 523. and came back after 9/11 as chief of a new Special Operations section. In the late 1990s, the CIA began to set up Counterterrorist Intelligence Centers, in collaboration with the intelligence services of individual countries to deal with Islamist militants. The CTICs spread widely after the September 11, 2001 attacks, existing in more than two dozen countries by 2005. Officers from the host nations serving in the CTICs were vetted by the CIA, and usually supervised by the local CIA chief of station. \\"The Plan\\", 1999–2001 In December 1998 CIA chief George Tenet \\"declared war\\" on Osama bin Laden.Coll, Ghost Wars, pp. 436–7, and p. 646 note 42; 9/11 Commission Report, chapter 11, p. 357 (HTML version). Early in 1999 Tenet ordered the CTC to conduct a review of the CIA's operational strategy, with the aim of creating \\"a new, comprehensive plan of attack\\" against al-Qaeda. By mid-September, the result of this review, known simply as \\"The Plan\\", had been briefed to CIA operational level personnel, and to the NSA, the FBI, and other partners. Once Cofer Black had finalized his operational plan, Charles E. Allen, associate deputy director of Central Intelligence for Collection, created a dedicated al-Qaeda cell with officers from across the intelligence community. This cell met daily, focusing on penetrating the Afghan sanctuary, and ensuring that collection initiatives were synchronized with operational plans. Allen met with Tenet on a weekly basis to review initiatives. The CIA increasingly concentrated its diminished resources on counterterrorism, so that resources for this activity increased sharply, in contrast to the general trend. At least some of the Plan's more modest aspirations were translated into action. Intelligence collection efforts on bin Laden and al-Qaeda increased significantly from 1999.Coll, Ghost Wars, pp. 457, 466–72, 485, and p. 654 note 7; Tenet statement to the Joint Inquiry on 9/11, Oct. 17, 2002; 9/11 Commission Report, chapter 4, pp. 142–3 (HTML version); Tenet, At the Center of the Storm, pp. 119, 120. The core 9/11 hijackers emerge Beginning in September 1999, the CTC picked up multiple signs that bin Laden had set in motion major terrorist attacks for the turn of the year. The CIA set in motion what Black later described as the \\"largest collection and disruption activity in the history of mankind\\". They focused on known al-Qaeda terrorists, and on senior personnel both inside and outside Afghanistan.Coll, Ghost Wars, pp. 495–6; 911 Commission Report, chapter 6, pp. 174–80 (HTML version). Amid this activity, in November–December 1999 Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, Ziad Jarrah, and Nawaf al-Hazmi visited Afghanistan, where they were selected by al-Qaeda for the 9/11 operation.9/11 Commission Report, chapter 5, pp. 155–8, 168 (HTML version). Data derived from subsequent intelligence interrogations of captives. In late 1999, the NSA picked up traces of an \\"operational cadre\\" consisting of al-Hazmi, his younger brother Salem, and Khalid al-Mihdhar, who were planning to go to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in January 2000. A CTC officer sought permission to conduct surveillance on the men.9/11 Commission Report, chapter 6, p. 181 (HTML version); Coll, Ghost Wars, pp. 487–88. At about this time the SOCOM-DIA data mining operation \\"Able Danger\\" also identified a potential al-Qaeda unit, consisting of the future leading 9/11 hijackers, and termed them the \\"Brooklyn cell\\". Altogether, the operation found five cells, including two of the three cells involved in the 9/11 attack.Shaffer interview on Able Danger , Government Security News, Aug. 2005Inside the Ring\\", Washington Times, Sept. 30, 2005. The CIA erratically tracked al-Hazmi and al- Mihdhar as they traveled to and attended the al-Qaeda summit in Kuala Lumpur in early January 2000.9/11 Commission Report, chapter 6, pp. 181–29/11 Commission Report chapter 11, pp. 383–4. The Predator drone, 2000–2001 In autumn 2000, a series of flights over Afghanistan by Predator drones, under the joint control of the USAF and the CTC, produced probable sightings of bin Laden. CTC Director Black advocated arming Predators with missiles to try to launch a targeted killing of bin Laden, but there were legal and technical issues. Black continued to lobby for Predators armed with adapted Hellfire anti-tank missiles under the new Bush administration in 2001. On Black's advice, Tenet raised the matter at the long-awaited Cabinet-level Principals Committee meeting on terrorism on September 4, 2001, and received authorization to deploy the system. 9/11 and after After the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, some CTC staff were exempted from an order to evacuate the CIA headquarters building at Langley. They included the shift of the Global Response Center on the exposed sixth floor, which Black had argued was essential to keep operating during the crisis. Tenet finally agreed with Black that their lives would have to be put at risk.Tenet, At the Center of the Storm, pp. 164–65. The conversation is a virtual replica of that given in Bob Woodward, Bush at War (2002/3) (Publisher's extract from chapter 1). The CTC obtained passenger lists from the planes used in the attack, and identified Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al- Hazmi,Tenet, At the Center of the Storm, p. 167. whose names they had first linked with terrorism in the winter of 1999–2000. Tenet later proposed inserting CIA teams into Afghanistan to assist local warlords in the fight against al-Qaeda. The CIA geared up to take the lead in the attack on al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. The NALT team, led by Gary Schroen, entered the country once more on September 26. A new branch was added to the CTC, named CTC Special Operations, or CTC/SO, headed by Henry Crumpton, with the aim of locating and destroying al-Qaeda resources. Execution of this mission was nowhere more evident than at Qala-i-Jangi, a 19th-century fortress on the outskirts of the northern Afghan town of Mazar-i-Sharif, when it fell to American allies.Tenet, At the Center of the Storm, pp. 209, 211, 217, 221–3.

The name is also spelled Iaualapiti in Portuguese. The current village Yawalapiti is situated more to the south, between the Tuatuari and Kuluene River. Their population in 2011 was 156, down from a 2010 population of 237 (2010) but up from a low of 25 in 1954. The Yawalapiti live in the Xingu Indian Park, in Upper Xingu region along with Kiabi, Yudja and Suya tribes. The ways of life of these four tribes are quite similar despite having different languages. Their villages are situated around Lake Ipavu, which is six kilometres from the Kuluene River. Language The Yawalapiti language is a Central Maipuran, part of the Maipuran language family, which are Arawakan languages. Yawalapiti is related to the Waurá and Mehináku languages. Description of villages Typical to Upper Xingu tribes, the Yawalapiti village is circular in shape and has communal houses surrounding a square (uikúka) cleared of vegetation. In the center of the square is the men's house: frequented only by the men and where the sacred flutes are stored and played. It is in this house, or at river banks nearby, that the men congregate to talk in the twilight and where they paint themselves for ceremonies.http://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/yawalapiti/1192 The men's house is similar to the residential houses. It only has one or two doors, always smaller than those of residences, which face the center square. The flutes are hung in the beams and during the day they may be played only in the house's interior; at night (after the women have retired) the men can play the flutes in the patio.  History  The first historical contact between the Yawalapiti and Europeans occurred in 1887, when they had been visited by Karl von den Steinen's expedition. In this period, they were located in the high course of the Tuatuari river, in a region between lagoons and quagmires identified by the Yawalapiti as a small farm. The German anthropologist's impression of these Indians was that of poverty, a people who had insufficient food to offer visitors.  Traditional rituals  The Quarup or Kuarup ritual is performed to honour the dead tribe members. It is held together with neighbouring tribes.

It is situated on the borders with the adjacent counties of West Yorkshire, and Lancashire. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is a village consisting of 1,000 to 2,000 residents, measured at 2,355 in the Census 2011. The village is expanding due to new housing being built in the middle of the village. Cowling includes a variety of services to support the community including a village hall, primary school, shops, a pub, a restaurant, a pizza take-away, and hairdressers. A gala is held in Cowling every year. History Holy Trinity Church, Cowling The village is Saxon in origin and is recorded in the Domesday Book as 'Collinge'. The name means Coll's people or tribe. At the time of the Norman conquest the main landowner was Gamel who had very large land holdings in Yorkshire. His name survives in Gamsgill on the northern edge of the village. Originally the village comprised three separate hamlets namely Ickornshaw, Middleton, Gill and Cowling Hill. It was only following the construction of the main Keighley to Colne road (A6068) and the building of large mills alongside the road that what is now regarded as the main village was constructed providing terraced cottage homes for the mill workers. The older parts of the village faded in importance and as a result the parish church and primary school are located on what appears to be the outskirts of the village between Ickornshaw and Middleton, the centre of the village having moved since their construction. The mills continued to operate and to provide the main source of local employment until the end of the 20th century but are now all closed down and their sites largely redeveloped for housing and the village hall. The village is now very much a dormitory village for those working in the surrounding towns of West Yorkshire and East Lancashire. It is the base for a licensed community radio station, Drystone Radio.

Caruana holding his Report on the Phoenician and Roman Antiquities in the group of islands of Malta (1888) Antonio Annetto Caruana (14 May 1830 – 3 March 1905), also known as A. A. Caruana, was a Maltese archaeologist and author.  Biography  Born in Valletta, Malta, Caruana showed an unusual proficiency in the knowledge of classical literature by his early adulthood. Graduating with a doctorate in Theology from the University of Malta, Caruana started a long career at the University of Malta which saw him secretary and rector of that institution for many years. He was later appointed Librarian and Keeper of Antiquities at the National Library of Malta (1880–1896) and is credited with bringing about various changes within the institution. He was concurrently Director of Education in Malta's imperial administration (1887–1896). Caruana is probably best known for his activities as an archaeologist, publishing numerous books and articles including his Report on the Phoenician and Roman Antiquities in the group of the islands of Malta, first published in 1882. He worked on the excavation of the Ħaġar Qim neolithic temple complex and the Domvs Romana in Rabat, Malta. He made his first excavations of catacombs in 1860 with Capt. Strickland and, from 1871, was active for the next thirty years in exploring myriad tombs and catacombs across the Maltese islands, which were rarely easy to get to. He also worked on the cleaning and surveying of St. Paul's Catacombs in 1894. Although many of his ideas have since been challenged, Caruana is considered to be a pioneer in the field of heritage management in the Maltese Islands.  Personal life  Caruana declined being ordained a priest to marry Maria Metropoli, one of three daughters of Dr Giuseppe Metropoli, notary to the Roman Curia in Malta, whose two other daughters married the 6th Count Preziosi and Salvatore dei Duchi Mattei. Their only son, John Caruana, was a 20th century Maltese philosopher and constitutional lawyer and the son-in-law of the Victorian architect Emanuele Luigi Galizia. One of Caruana's direct descendants married the Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who wrote a thesis on his life and work for her degree in archaeology at the University of Malta. Caruana lived at 266, St Paul's Street, Valletta.

Its role was to “provide, manage, maintain, and furnish the property used by the government, including defence establishments, offices, courts, research laboratories, training centres and land”. Saturday, June 27, 2020 Early history The PSA had its antecedents in the Ministry of Works and earlier departments dating back to the Office of Works. It was created as an autonomous agency in 1972 after the Ministry of Works had been absorbed into the Department of the Environment.  First decade, 1972-1981  The agency had the job of providing, equipping and maintaining a wide range of buildings and installations for government departments, and the armed services, as well as other bodies. It held and managed much of the government's civil estate, including government offices and establishments all over the United Kingdom as well as the diplomatic estate abroad. It managed Ministry of Defence property on its behalf, both at home and overseas. Within the agency was PSA Supplies, which provided furniture, transport and other services, and operated on a trading fund basis. The clients it served were mainly government departments, but it had certain other clients, the most important of which was the Post Office, for which it provided services on repayment. In 1976, PSA Supplies was rebranded as The Crown Suppliers (TCS), becoming a self-funding business under the auspices of the PSA.Hansard HC Deb 03 February 1988 vol 126 cc979-87 In 1977 the staff of the agency was about 50,000, of whom about 30,000 were industrial workers, including about 7,000 locally engaged staff overseas. Of the 20,000 non- industrials, more than half were specialist staff—architects, civil, mechanical and electrical engineers, quantity surveyors, building surveyors, estate surveyors, technicians and drawing office staff.Parliamentary Orders of the Day, 11 March 1977 The agency undertook all types of construction work—from houses and barracks for the Services to offices, research facilities, airfields, dockyards and telephone exchanges for the Post Office. In 1977 it had about 1,500 major new works projects in various stages of design, and about 1,000 under construction. During that year the Agency's expenditure on new works were £400 million. For the first decade of its existence the PSA was a centralised organisation which controlled all building and estates management works for government departments and the armed services. The PSA was the central budget holder for all such works, and let contracts with the private construction industry on behalf of its clients. This put the PSA in a monopoly position, and meant that client departments often had little control over their own estate management. In 1981 the recently elected Conservative government ruled that 70% of work should be contracted out to private consultants, with the PSA still retaining overall control. Corruption problems in the 1980s, and eventual privatisation Evidence of corruption in PSA District Works Offices came to light in the early 1980s, and as a result the government appointed Sir Geoffrey Wardale to carry out an inquiry. The Wardale Report was published in October 1983. The PSA's then chief executive, Montague Alfred, was removed from his post because the Secretary of State concluded that Alfred's evidence to the Committee was \\"contrary to government policy\\". These problems, combined with the government’s intention to pursue a programme of privatisation of public organisations, led in 1988 to the PSA being put on a commercial footing, and obliged to bid for project work in open competition with the private construction industry. In 1990, The Property Services Agency and Crown Suppliers Act paved the way for privatisation.Property Services Agency and Crown Suppliers Act 1990, Parliament Then on 1 April 1990 the PSA was split into two separate organisations: * Property Holdings, which remained within government and managed the portfolio of civil estates. * PSA Services, which operated as a commercial entity bidding for new building work from public sector organisations; equally, PSA Services was free to seek work in markets outside the public sector. The progress towards full commercialisation was completed in 1992, when PSA Services was itself further split into three organisations: * PSA Projects (the branch which dealt with new building projects), which was offered for sale to the private sector, and purchased by Tarmac in 1992. (Although nominally a sale, the transaction was eventually estimated by the National Audit Office to have cost the government £81.3 million). From October 1993 it traded as TBV Consult, later being renamed TPS Consult in 1997, and becoming part of Carillion in a demerger in 1999. * PSA Building Management (the branch which maintained the existing estate) was divided into five regional businesses to be sold individually. * PSA International (which looked after the overseas diplomatic and military estates) which was closed down in 1993. * The Crown Suppliers (formerly PSA Supplies) was subject to a separate but abortive privatisation in 1991. The bulk of the business was closed with the exception of its Liverpool Office which remained trading within the public sector as The Buying Agency (TBA). Since the break-up of the PSA many government departments have taken back responsibility for their estates management, and set up their own property management departments. The largest of these is Defence Estates, looking after the military sites and land operated by the Ministry of Defence. Organisation and location The headquarters of the PSA were in Croydon, Greater London, occupying space in several 1960s office blocks including the Whitgift Centre, Lunar House and Apollo House. The PSA also had offices in central London, and a regional network of offices throughout the UK. The headquarters organisation consisted of various offices and Directorates, including the Directorate of Architectural Services (DAS), the Directorate of Post Office Services (DPOS), the Directorate of Civil Engineering Services (DCES), and the Directorate of Building and Quantity Surveying Services (DBQSS). The PSA also provided building and engineering services to the armed forces, such as the services provided by the Directorate of Works (Air) (DW(AIR)) for the RAF. The purpose of the Directorates was to set policy and draft the technical standards and specifications to be used in building works. The headquarters organisation also had direct control of flagship construction projects such as the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London. Also located in Croydon was the PSA's central facility for training architectural and engineering draughtsmen, the Drawing Office Training Centre (DOTC), in 'C' Block in the Whitgift Centre in the 1970s, moving to Quest House in 1977. The accounts section of the PSA was located in Ashdown House, Hastings which was originally built in 1966. Also located at Ashdown House, was the Directorate of Information Technology and Management Operating Systems (DITMOS), charged with providing database systems for the PSA. In 1985, 1,500 civil servants were employed at Ashdown House. There was a UK regional network for the rest of the PSA's building and estates management work. There were offices for Scotland and Wales, and offices in the English regions (in London, Leeds, Cambridge, Hastings, Reading, Bristol, Birmingham and Manchester; the Manchester office included Northern Ireland in its territory). Under the regional offices were Area Works Offices, and then at a further sub-level operated the District Works Offices (DWOs). The main function of the DWOs was to carry out maintenance and small building projects. The DWOs were mostly situated in urban centres where there were a number of government buildings to maintain, or on military installations. Chief Executive The Chief Executive of the PSA had the status of Second Permanent Secretary in the British civil service structure, and was accountable to the Secretary of State for the Environment. * 1972–1974: John Cuckney (later Baron Cuckney) * 1974–1981: W R (Sir Robert) Cox * 1982–1984: Montague Alfred * 1984–1990: Sir Gordon Manzie * 1990–1991: Patrick Brown (later Sir) * 1991–1993: Sir Geoffrey Chipperfield * 1993–1994: Philip Fletcher ReferencesExternal links *Parliamentary Archives, Records of the Property Services Agency, 1972-1990 Category:Privatised executive agencies of the United Kingdom government Category:1972 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1993 disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:Government agencies established in 1972 Category:Government agencies disestablished in 1993 ","title":"Property Services Agency"},{"id":"12723042","text":"Cinema City Cinema City is a Grade I listedHistoric England Retrieved 24 October 2015 cultural cinema in the city of Norwich in Norfolk, England. The building is owned by Norwich City Council and the site is managed by the charity Cinema City Ltd (changed name from Norfolk and Norwich Film Theatre Ltd in August 2014), charity number 288309. Commercial activities - film screenings, bar and restaurant - are carried out by Picturehouse Cinemas Limited which operates a national chain of 'art house' cinemas, called Picturehouse. Picturehouse is part of the Cineworld chain. Cinema City Ltd (the charity) undertakes education activities on site and throughout Norfolk through its education arm Cinema Plus. History The cinema occupies Suckling House, a partly medieval merchant's house in St Andrews Street, named after the Suckling family who owned it in the sixteenth century. The oldest surviving parts of the building are from the early fourteenth century. The front of the house in St Andrew's Hill dates from an eighteenth-century renovation. A brick building, known as Stuart Hall was added on the east side in 1925. Suckling Hall was last used as a residence in 1915. It was bought by the Norfolk News Company in 1916 who made some repairs before selling it to Ethel Mary and Helen Caroline Colman in 1923. They restored it and added Stuart Hall, intended as a public hall with a capacity of around 450 people fitted with a cinema projector and screen. In 1925 they presented Suckling House and the new hall to the City of Norwich to be used for \\"the advancement of education in its widest and most comprehensive sense\\". Cinema City first opened at Suckling Hall in April 1978 as a cinema seating 230. Renovations took place in 1981 including a new projection box, stairs and box office. The Great Hall became a bar and the vaulted bay nearest the hall was turned into a kitchen. The present cinema The cinema moved temporarily to the Norwich Playhouse in 2004 while its original premises were rebuilt as a three-screen cinema, which reopened in 2007. Redevelopment works were in large part funded by an Arts Council grant in excess of £3m. Screen One, with just under 200 seats, is on the first floor, equipped with both digital and 35mm projectors. Screen Two has just under 100 seats, and Screen Three just over 60. A couple of metres were dug down to create space for the new auditoria, which have their screens backing onto St Andrews Street. There is a new lobby at this level, in a 17th-century panelled room. The courtyard provides a pleasant area for eating and drinking, and the adjacent 14th century vaulted rooms, the oldest part of the building, have been opened to the public for the first time, to form new dining areas. In March, 2013 as the cinema celebrated its 35th anniversary, the actor, John Hurt, was announced as patron of the cinema.EDP news report Retrieved 29 April 2013 See also * Norwich Arts Centre * Norwich Playhouse ReferencesExternal links * http://www.picturehouses.co.uk/ * http://www.norwichplayhouse.co.uk/ * http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/films/cinema_city.shtml Category:Cinemas in Norfolk Category:Buildings and structures in Norwich Category:Tourist attractions in Norwich Category:Norwich Category:Grade I listed buildings in Norfolk ","title":"Norwich Cinema City"},{"id":"12723060","text":"Milton Subotsky (September 27, 1921 – June 27, 1991) was an American film and television writer and producer.

Based at Shepperton Studios, they produced such films as Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1964), Dr. Who and the Daleks (1965), Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D. (1966), Torture Garden (1967), Scream and Scream Again (1970), The House That Dripped Blood (1970), Tales from The Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), From Beyond the Grave (1973) and The Land That Time Forgot (1974). Sword & Sorcery Productions Amicus was disestablished in 1975, but Subotsky continued producing. Around this time he formed \\"Sword & Sorcery Productions, Ltd.\\" with Frank Duggan. At some point Andrew Donally joined the company. Numerous well-publicised projects did not go into production. These include adaptations of Lin Carter's \\"Thongor\\" stories, a live-action version of Stan Lee's The Incredible Hulk, film adaptations of stories that appeared in James Warren's comic magazines Creepy and Eerie, and a co-production with former James Bond film producer Harry Saltzman on Saltzman's troubled \\"shrunken man\\" epic The Micronauts. Unable to purchase film rights to Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian stories, Subotsky instead bought the rights to Carter's \\"Thongor\\" stories in 1976. Subotsky himself adapted Carter's 1965 novel The Wizard of Lemuria. United Artists agreed to bankroll the project – now called Thongor in the Valley of Demons – in 1978, but subsequently withdrew for unspecified reasons. Sword & Sorcery's first film project to get off the ground was Dominique. In 1980, they co- produced the TV series The Martian Chronicles, adapted from the short story collection by Ray Bradbury. During the making of this miniseries, Subotsky and Donally parted ways. Later career and death Subotsky also co-produced several adaptations of Stephen King novels, including Maximum Overdrive (1986), Sometimes They Come Back (a 1991 TV film) and The Lawnmower Man. The Director's Cut of the latter was dedicated to his memory. Subotsky died of heart disease in 1991, at the age of 69. His widow, Dr Fiona Subotsky, is a prominent London psychiatrist, and an historian of psychiatry.

While external spray systems have long been used in fire protection for buildings and facilities, EWSS refers to domestic bushfire/wildfire systems.  Usage  The types of systems vary greatly from a single impact sprinkler placed on a roof, systems installed during construction with sprays on all windows and doors, and small sprays damping gutters. Some are installed using copper piping and sprays while others use common PVC piping. Usage depends on type of risk and belief of effectiveness. Copper piping is used to withstand high temperatures that may be experienced during a fire front or for higher reliability for in ceiling installations. External PVC piping is used where failure with exposure to high radiant heat is acceptable, as at the time the system is considered have \\"done its job\\". This is a matter of personal judgment. Issues There is a lack of scientific research regarding EWSS. Other issues that may affect the effectiveness of an EWSS: * Sprinkler performance in high wind conditions typical in a bushfire * Home design ** High vulnerability areas. e.g. Decking ** Garden beds near walls ** Window sills ** Large windows (heat radiation) ** Internal furnishings (e.g. curtains) * Home location ** Slope ** Surrounding vegetation * If defended by occupiers * Preparation (if prepared for defense) * If intended for remote (unattended) defense * Available water supply * Ember attack * Fire front (radiant heat) * Adjacent building or vegetation fire Types * Roof impact sprinkler * Gutter sprays * Window spray / deluge Commercial sprays designed for EWSS are available, but most systems use commonly available irrigation sprinklers/sprays. Research External spray systems for buildings are well documented for protection from fires in adjacent buildings. However, up there is little published scientific research on scientific information pertaining to the effectiveness of EWSS under varying wildfire conditions.

His most famous paintings depict the harsh died of the Croatian peasantry in the manner of naive art. He was one of the founders of the Earth Group. Biography He was born in Petrinja, but when his father died in 1909, the family came back to Hlebine, the village in the region of Podravina from which they originated. In 1920 Hegedušić enrolled in the Arts and Crafts College in Zagreb, where he made his first idyllic paintings of Podravina. The painting courses of Vladimir Becić and Tomislav Krizman widened his horizons, but did not influence his style. In 1926 he was awarded a French government scholarship and spent two years in Paris. There he studied the paintings of Pieter Brueghel. Hegedušić made his first one-man exhibition with Juraj Plančić at the Ulrich Gallery in Zagreb in 1926. He made paintings with social themes, showing the exploitation of the Croatian peasants. In 1929 he got together with the painters Ivan Tabaković and Oton Postružnik, as well as Leo Junek in Paris. They founded Zemlja (\\"soil\\" in Croatian), the first Croatian group of artists that promoted Marxism. Hegedušić was their ideologue and unofficial leader. Paintings like The Accordionist and The Flood are socially critical and reject purely artistic goals. In 1930 he founded the Hlebine School, a naive art movement that involved young peasant painters. One of them, Ivan Generalić, reached world fame. Podravina Motifs, published in 1933, was a book combining his drawings with a poetic essay by Miroslav Krleža, today considered a masterpiece of Croatian literature. Krleža would later write a script for a documentary feature about Hegedušić (1962). Hegedušić started teaching at the Academy of Fine Arts Zagreb in 1936. During the anti- communist oppression in the 1930s, he was arrested several times. When the Nazi-sponsored Ustaša came to power in 1941, Hegedušić came under the protection of the Archbishop Stepinac. He spent the war quietly working on various themes, including religion (numerous sketches for the Calvary fresco in Marija Bistrica in 1941). When the communist government was installed in Yugoslavia in 1945, Hegedušić was appointed professor at the Zagreb Academy. In 1950, he founded a \\"master's studio\\" there. The \\"master's studio\\" eventually gathered an impressive list of notable painters such as Miroslav Šutej, Zlatko Sirotić, and others. After the World War II, he started painting some surrealistic paintings. For example, Dead Waters is somewhat remindful of themes of the Theatre of the Absurd. Paintings like The Bridegroom, the Ox and the Pump from 1969 are critical of urban life. In the period 1971–73, Hegedušić worked on a large cycle of macabre frescoes for the war memorial of Tjentište. He illustrated books and designed ballet and theater sets. He died in Zagreb.

Moorland near Pen y Graig Gron, above the tree-line of the forested slopes. Pools on the moorland near Pen y Graig Gron. A re-arranged cairn on Cefn Cyfarwydd. Cefn Cyfarwydd is a ridge in Conwy county borough, north Wales. It is located above the village of Trefriw on the western side of the Conwy valley, and dramatically separates Cwm Cowlyd and the rugged mountains of the Carneddau from the greener, lusher Conwy valley. The Welsh word cyfarwydd can mean either \\"familiar\\" (adj.) or \\"a story-teller, guide or expert\\" (noun). Cefn means \\"ridge\\". 'Cefn Cyfarwydd' therefore translates as either \\"familiar ridge\\" or \\"story- teller's ridge\\". Extent The ridge reaches some 500m in height, and covers an area of some 8 square kilometres, broadly 4 km long by 2 km wide. It runs in a largely SW - NE direction, and is relatively flat-topped, resulting in some wet pools and boggy patches, even in the summer months. Much of it is heathery moorland. To the north-west it slopes down steeply to Llyn Cowlyd, and to the south-east to Llyn Crafnant and the Crafnant valley where, in places, these slopes have been forested. The south-eastern slope of the ridge is steeper than the north-western slope. The north-eastern end of the ridge drops into the Conwy valley between Trefriw and Dolgarrog, whilst to the south-west it runs on to become Pen y Graig Gron (\\"top/end of the round stone\\"), then rises to the ridge of Creigiau Gleision (\\"blue-green rocks\\") (over 600m in height) and the Crimpiau. For much of its length it affords splendid views in all directions. Height There is a trig point (triangulation pillar TP2074) recording a height of 419 m (1375 ft) at location SH7641664273. Streetmap location This can be easily viewed from Ffordd Cowlyd, the lane from Trefriw to Llyn Cowlyd, which crosses Cefn Cyfarwydd towards its northern end. The trig point is, however, not at the highest point of the ridge. The highest point actually lies some mile to the south-west, where a cairn has been placed at a height of 503 m (1650 ft). Streetmap location This is just a little north of the remains of Lledwigan burial cairn, which probably dates to the Bronze Age.www.coflein.gov.uk - Cefn Cyfarwydd Access The top of the ridge is remote and wild, in direct contrast to the Conwy valley to the east. Whilst remote, it can be accessed by a number of rights of way - * from the southern end of Llyn Crafnant (on the path to Capel Curig) via the Crimpiau * from the southern end of Llyn Crafnant, via the forested slopes * from halfway down the Crafnant valley, skirting Lledwigan Farm * from Ffordd Cowlyd (the road from Trefriw) which crosses its northern end, near to the triangulation point (at 419m) Geodaisy Triangulation point * from Llyn Cowlyd dam up to the top of the ridge * from Capel Curig, via The Crimpiau or Creigiau Gleision Whilst it is possible to traverse the entire length of the ridge, the north-eastern half is lacking in good paths through the heather, gorse and bilberry, and boggy patches abound. Sheep tracks criss-cross in all directions, and some are used by farmers' quad bikes which makes them the best option, but they are hard to find, even in good conditions. It is easier to find a good path when traversing from south to north (i.e. towards the Trefriw road), as paths can be seen when looking down from above. Old settlement The ridge contains the evidence of many remains of old settlement. The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales reports that a survey in 1993-4 added around 600 sites to the 2 already recorded on the Sites and Monuments Record. According to this record,Royal Commission on Monuments of Wales website the earliest evidence of activity was 4 cairns, probably dating back to the Bronze Age, and there was a round hut with adjoining sub-rectangular structures suggesting late prehistoric settlement. Many remains indicated mediaeval occupation, but these were not on the exposed top of the ridge, but generally between the 250m and 350m contours, where the soil was better and there was more shelter. Most of the later sites have agricultural connections, and in some places traces of earlier field patterns survive. The most substantial remains today are derelict farmhouses, and even two derelict chapels. It is possible that some of the buildings on the edges of the marginal land may be hafotai (summer dwellings) rather than permanent dwellings. Industry The ridge also shows evidence of peat cutting, and there are the remains of several mine trials and small-scale quarrying, such as what is known today as Cefn Cyfarwydd slate mine. Changing view The view from Cefn Cyfarwydd has always changed, from the construction of Cowlyd Dam, to the pylons which have appeared further down the Conwy Valley, and as the town of Llanrwst has grown. The 21st century has seen the development of 12 turbines at the Moel Maelogan wind farm on the other side of the Conwy Valley, and very visible from this ridge.

Background He was born Richard Benyon in Westminster on 28 April 1769, one of four sons and five daughters of Richard Benyon MP of Gidea Hall in Essex and Englefield House, Berkshire and his wife Hannah Hulse, the eldest daughter of Sir Edward Hulse, 1st Baronet of Breamore House, Hampshire. Estates and names Richard Benyon succeeded to his father's estates in 1796. In 1814, after succeeding to the estates of his half-uncle Powlett Wrighte of Englefield House (who had died in 1779) he assumed the name of Richard Powlett-Wrighte; and, in 1822, after the death of his distant relative, the Rev. Peter De Beauvoir, Rector of Davenham in Essex, from whom he inherited very large property, both in estates and in the funds, he assumed the name of Richard De Beauvoir. In 1824 he purchased the Culford Estate, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, for £230,000, including the timber, from Louisa, Marchioness Cornwallis, widow of Charles, 2nd Marquis Cornwallis. The estate also included the parishes of Culford, Ingham, Timworth, West Stow and Wordwell. He was reputed to be worth over 7 million. His land agent was Robert Todd and his head gardener was William Armstrong and these two men dealt with day-to-day work on the estate, particularly when Mr Benyon was not in residence. New flint and brick estate workers' cottages were under construction at Culford, as can be seen in letters between Richard Benyon de Beauvoir and Robert Todd. The dwellings won an award for their sensible design; they still stand along Main Road, Culford, today, surrounded by their large gardens. In letters dated 19 April and 6 May 1825 Todd writes that the Armstrongs have a troublesome marriage; \\"she has experienced not only insult but blows\\" and, in the later letter, \\"P.S. Armstrong and his wife are parted. She left Culford last Tuesday, is in lodgings in Bury at present.\\" In 1883 John Bateman listed farmland inherited from R. B. de Beauvoir in his compilation: he had the Rev. Edward Richard Benyon,the Rev. Edward Richard Benyon of Culford Hall, Bury St. Edmunds, (born 1802–), as holding in Suffolk 10,060 acres (worth 6,928 per annum rental), in Essex 601 acres (worth 848 guineas per annum), and in Huntingdon 3 acres (worth 8 guineas per annum). Meanwhile, Bateman describes Richard Fellowes Benyon, of Englefield, as having in Berkshire 10,129 acres (worth 13,303 guineas per annum); in Essex 3,438 acres (worth 5,163 guineas per annum); and in Hampshire 2,440 acres (worth 1,538 guineas per annum).The Great Landowners of Great Britain and Ireland, John Bateman, 1883 Offices and charitable works Richard Benyon De Beauvoir was a member of parliament (MP) for Pontefract from 1802 to 1806, and for Wallingford during two parliaments, from 1806 to 1812. He was a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant for the county of Berkshire. He was High Sheriff of Berkshire in 1816. When the Royal Berkshire Hospital was founded at Reading, Mr. Benyon contributed the huge sum of £5,000 and, by his liberality, aided materially in the formation of that invaluable charity. A ward in the hospital was subsequently named after him. He was considered by far the richest commoner in Berkshire. Family He married, on 27 September 1797, Elizabeth the only daughter of Sir Francis Sykes, Bart, of Basildon Park in Berkshire. This lady died on 29 October 1822. As they had no children, when Richard died on 22 March 1854, his estates were inherited by his nephew, Richard Fellowes, the son of William Henry Fellowes of Ramsey Abbey in Huntingdonshire, who also took on the name of Benyon.

He was a politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1640 and fought for the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. Life Scawen was the son of Robert Scawen of St. Germans and Isabella Nicholls, daughter of Humphrey Nicholls of St Tudy.Visitation of the County of Cornwall in 1620St Tudy church, Cornwall; flickr He was a Cornish gentleman and Vice-Warden of the Stannaries. In April 1640 he was elected MP for St Germans and for East Looe in the Short Parliament. The parliament did not last long enough for all such double elections to be resolved. He supported the Royalist cause in the Civil War and fought alongside Cornish speaking soldiers.VCH Explore William Scawen and the Cornish Revival On the Restoration he was one of those proposed for the honour of Knight of the Royal Oak. Scawen realised that the Cornish language was dying out and wrote detailed manuscripts which he started working on when he was 78. Between 1679 and 1680, he made an English translation of a Cornish medieval passion poem Pascon agan Arluth. His main work included observations on the ancient manuscript, entitled, \\"Passio Christi\\", written in the Cornish language, and now preserved in the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford (published in London in 1777). It features an account of the language, manners, and customs of the Cornish people. The only version that was ever published was a short first draft, but the manuscript, which evolved continually until his death, is hundreds of pages long – with small notes stuck in all through it in his increasingly illegible handwriting. He identified sixteen reasons for the decline of the Cornish language which included gentry antipathy to the language, nearness of English-speaking Devon, loss of records in the Civil War, lack of a Bible in Cornish, end of native language miracle play performances and loss of contact with Brittany. Scawen's sister Elizabeth married Martin Keigwin, and was the mother of John Keigwin. The Keigwins were also active in promoting the revival of the Cornish language. Bibliography *Ellis, P. B.

The 64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot was created on 21 April 1758 from the 2nd Battalion of the 11th Regiment of Foot. In 1881, under the Childers Reforms, the 64th Regiment of Foot was merged with the 98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot (originally raised in 1824) to form the Prince of Wales's (North Staffordshire Regiment). In 1921 the regimental title was altered to the North Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's). Formed at a time when the British Empire was reaching its peak, the regiment served all over the Empire, in times of both peace and war, and in many theatres of war outside the Empire. It fought with distinction in World War I and World War II, as well as in other smaller conflicts around the world. These other wars included the Second Sudanese War, the Second Boer War, the Anglo-Irish War and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. In 1959, as part of a defence review, the North Staffordshire Regiment, by now reduced to only a single regular battalion, was amalgamated with the South Staffordshire Regiment to form the Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's) which was, in 2006, amalgamated with the Cheshire Regiment and the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot) to form the Mercian Regiment. Today the traditions of the North Staffordshire Regiment are continued by the Mercian Regiment. Formation history The Prince of Wales's (North Staffordshire) Regiment was formed under the Childers Reforms on 1 July 1881, by the amalgamation of the 64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot and 98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot. These two regular regiments became, respectively, the 1st and 2nd battalions of the new regiment. The Militia and Rifle Volunteers forces of North Staffordshire were also incorporated into this new regiment, and a permanent depot was established at Whittington Barracks, Lichfield, which also housed the newly formed South Staffordshire Regiment. The 64th Regiment of Foot was originally raised in 1756 as the 2nd Battalion of the 11th (Devonshire) Foot, and was renumbered the 64th in 1758. It had a long history of overseas service with much less time spent in Europe. It had served in the West Indies during the Seven Years' War, America during the American War of Independence, South America, the West Indies and Canada during the Napoleonic Wars. Subsequent long periods were spent in Ireland and the West Indies before action was seen in India during the Indian Mutiny. At the time of the forming of the amalgamation with the 98th Foot, the 64th was based in Ireland. The 98th Regiment of Foot, raised in 1824 in Chichester, had a much shorter history, but like the 64th had spent the majority of its time overseas spending a long time in South Africa before seeing action in China in the First Anglo-Chinese (or Opium) War and India on the North West Frontier. It was based in Afghanistan when the amalgamation occurred. The battalions that constituted the regiment in 1881 were as follows: * 1st Battalion: the 64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot; * 2nd Battalion: the 98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot; * 3rd (Militia) Battalion: The King's Own (2nd Staffordshire) Light Infantry Militia, based in Stafford; * 4th (Militia) Battalion: The King's Own (3rd Staffordshire) Rifles Militia, based in Newcastle-under-Lyme; * 1st Volunteer Battalion: 2nd Staffordshire (Staffordshire Rangers) Rifle Volunteer Corps, based in Stoke-on-Trent; * 2nd Volunteer Battalion: 5th Staffordshire Rifle Volunteer Corps, based in Lichfield but later moved to Burton-on-Trent. Volunteers and Territorials The 2nd and 5th Staffordshire Rifle Volunteer Corps were designated the 1st and 2nd Volunteer battalions, North Staffordshire Regiment, in 1883. Together with the Volunteer battalions of the South Staffordshire Regiment, they formed the Staffordshire Volunteer Infantry Brigade in 1888. This brigade was intended to assemble at Wolverhampton in time of war, while in peacetime it acted as a focus for collective training of the Volunteers. On the formation of the Territorial Force in 1908, the two Volunteer battalions were renumbered as the 5th and 6th battalions of the North Staffordshire Regiment, forming part of the Staffordshire Brigade in the North Midland Division. The reserve battalions of the regiment were also reorganised in 1908 by the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907, with the two militia battalions being re- designated the 3rd (Special) and 4th (Special Reserve) battalions, and the volunteer battalions being re-designated as Territorial Force and renumbered as the 5th and 6th battalions (TF): they were based at College Road in Hanley and Horninglow Street in Burton upon Trent respectively. Early service (1881–1914)=Garrison duties and the Mahdist War Officers of the 2nd Battalion, India 1908 The 1st Battalion was stationed in Ireland at the time of the amalgamation. It moved to England in 1883, and the following year to the West Indies, based mainly in Barbados, but with detachments on other islands. It moved to Natal in 1887, to Mauritius in 1890, to Malta in 1893 and to Egypt in 1895. From there the 1st Battalion took part in operations in the Second Sudanese War under Lord Kitchener. During the campaign, the 1st Battalion were based initially at Wadi Halfa but moved to Gemai to avoid a cholera outbreak. In September the battalion took part in the action against the Dervish Army at Hafir, which was decisive in ending the campaign. As a result, the North Staffordshire Regiment received the unique \\"Hafir\\" battle honour, given to no other British regiment. Second Boer War The 2nd Battalion was stationed in India in 1881 when the North Staffordshire Regiment was formed, and remained there until 1886. During this time period, it took part in an expedition to the Zhob Valley in 1884, thus making it the first battalion in the regiment to see active service. In 1886, it returned to England via Aden, and then deployed to Ireland in 1893. In 1899, 2nd Battalion mobilised and moved to South Africa, where it took part in the Second Boer War. Forming part of 15th Brigade in the 7th Division, the majority of the battalion saw little action throughout the conflict, being mostly occupied in garrison duties in Johannesburg in 1900. In 1901, the battalion was part of a mobile column under Brigadier-General Dartnell in the Eastern Transvaal which carried out a scorched earth campaign. More action was seen by the mounted infantry company of the regiment that had been formed on arrival in South Africa. In January 1900 Lord Roberts, commander of the British forces in South Africa, ordered that every infantry battalion in South Africa was to raise a company of mounted infantry. These companies were to be detached from their parent units and operate as part of eight independent mounted infantry battalions. The North Staffords company thus formed became part of the 8th Battalion, Mounted Infantry. This unit was involved in the pursuit of Koos de la Rey and was present when he was captured at Wildfontein. The militia and volunteer battalions also saw service in the Second Boer War. The 4th Battalion was deployed in the Cape Colony and later the Bechuanaland Protectorate before being replaced by the 3rd Battalion. Additionally, the two volunteer companies which formed from the 1st and 2nd Volunteer battalions served alongside the 2nd Battalion at various times. As a result of these contributions and those of the two regular battalions, the regiment was awarded the \\"South Africa 1900–1902\\" battle honour. At the war's end in June 1902, the 2nd battalion returned to England on the SS Galeka in October that year, but the home posting was brief. In the following year, it returned to India, remaining there until 1919. Meeting in India The 1st Battalion was stationed in India from 1897 until 1903. The battalion was divided between barracks in Jhansi and Nowgong until late 1902, when it was reunited at Bombay. The following year, the 1st and 2nd Battalions met for the first time, and no fewer than 590 men from the 1st Battalion were transferred to the 2nd Battalion. Thus 1st Battalion was reduced to a small cadre, which served for nine years upon its return to Lichfield and other stations in England, before moving to Buttevant in Ireland in 1912. First World War (1914–1918) The North Staffordshire Regiment was heavily committed to the fighting during the First World War, and over the course of the conflict, was expanded to 18 battalions, some by duplication of the Territorial Force battalions and others, labelled \\"service\\" battalions raised as part of Field Marshal Kitchener's New Army. These battalions saw service in a number of theatres including on the Western Front, at Gallipoli, in the Middle East, and India. The following list details the involvement of these battalions: * 1st Battalion – served in France from September 1914 until November 1918; * 2nd Battalion – served in India throughout the war; * 3rd (Reserve) Battalion – operated as a training battalion in the United Kingdom throughout the war; * 4th (Extra Reserve) Battalion – garrison battalion in Guernsey 1914–1916. Returned to United Kingdom in 1916. Served in France 1917–1918; * 1/5th Battalion Territorial Force (TF) – mobilised in 1914, and served in France from 1915 to 1918; * 1/6th Battalion TF – mobilised in 1914, served in France from 1915 to 1918; * 2/5th Battalion TF – formed in 1914, moved to Ireland in 1916 where it was involved in the Easter Rising, served in France 1917–1918. Merged with 1/5th Battalion in February 1918; * 2/6th Battalion TF – formed in 1914, moved to Ireland in 1916 where it was involved in the Easter Rising, served in France 1917–1918. Merged with 1/6th Battalion in July 1918; * 3/5th Battalion TF – formed in 1915. Renamed 5th (Reserve) Battalion in April 1916. Served as a training battalion in England 1915–1918; * 3/6th Battalion TF – formed in 1915. Renamed 6th (Reserve) Battalion in April 1916. Merged with 5th (Reserve) Battalion in September 1916; * 7th (Service) Battalion – formed in 1914. Took part in Gallipoli Campaign July 1915 – January 1916. Evacuated to Egypt. Served in Mesopotamia from February 1916. From July 1918 were part of North Persia Force (Dunsterforce) and ended the war in Baku, Azerbaijan. * 8th (Service) Battalion – formed in 1914. Served in France 1915–1918; * 9th (Service) Battalion (Pioneers) – formed as a service battalion in 1914. Became a pioneer battalion in 1915. Served in France and Belgium 1915–1919; * 10th (Reserve) Battalion – formed as a service battalion in 1914. Became a reserve battalion in 1915. Renamed as 3rd Training Reserve Battalion of 1st Reserve Brigade in 1916; * 11th (Reserve) Battalion – formed as a service battalion in 1914. Became a reserve battalion in 1915. Renamed as 4th Training Reserve Battalion of 1st Reserve Brigade in 1916; * 12th (Service) Battalion – formed 1918 in France from 11th Garrison Guard Battalion. Renamed as a service battalion and continued to serve in France; * 1st (Garrison) Battalion – formed in 1916. Served in France 1916–1918. Renamed 13th (Garrison) Battalion in July 1918; * 2nd (Home Service Garrison) Battalion – formed in 1916. Became 17th Battalion Royal Defence Corps in 1917. The numbering of the Territorial Force battalions was laid down by War Office instructions issued in 1914 and 1915. On joining the Territorial Force men were asked if they would serve overseas (foreign service) or just volunteered for service in the United Kingdom (home service) and their service records amended accordingly. At the declaration of war all Territorial battalions were mobilised and on 15 August 1914 the War Office issued instructions for those men who had volunteered for foreign service to be separated out into what were called first line battalions. Home service men were placed in second line battalions. Thus there would now be a first line 5th Battalion and a second line 5th Battalion. On 24 November 1914, as the first line battalions began to go overseas, additional instructions were issued allowing the raising of a third line battalion once the first line battalion was on foreign service. In January 1915 these designations were simplified and the battalions called the 1/5th, 2/5th and 3/5th battalions respectively. The battalions that served in France took part in many of the major actions of the war including the 1915 Battle of Neuve Chapelle, the 1915 Battle of Loos, the Battle of the Somme in 1916, the Third Battle of Ypres in 1917 and the Battle of Amiens in 1918. Officers of the 1st Battalion, photographed in Cambridge in August 1914, shortly before embarking for France on 8 September. Of those who sailed, only five would still be with the battalion by the end of January 1915, most of the remainder having been killed or wounded. Those pictured include Lieut.-Colonel V. W. de Falbe, D.S.O., Battalion Commanding Officer (seated row, centre); and junior subaltern 2nd Lieut. Vyvyan Pope, who later commanded the battalion June 1917–March 1918 (back row, third from left). Military service ;1st Battalion The 1st Battalion went to France in September 1914 as part of 17th Brigade in 6th Division. It took part in the First Battle of Ypres being based in the Armentières sector on the southern flank of the battle. In December 1914 it was in trenches in the Rue-du-Bois area (near Fleurbaix), and participated in the Christmas truce, where British and German soldiers fraternised in no man's land. In March 1915 it carried out a successful action in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, capturing the village of L'Epinette. In October 1915 17th Brigade was exchanged with 71st Brigade of 24th Division, as part of an official policy of mixing Regular with New Army units. Immediately on joining 24th Division, the battalion was moved to 72nd Brigade within the same division. It was to remain part of this formation until the end of the war. In April and June 1916 the battalion suffered casualties of well over 500 in two serious gas attacks, on both occasions when in trenches north of Wulverghem (near Messines). In August–September 1916, the 24th Division participated in the Battle of the Somme. The 1st Battalion was engaged in the fighting around Guillemont and later the defence of Delville Wood, suffering a total of more than 350 casualties. In June 1917, the battalion was involved (and suffered over 150 casualties) in the assault on Messines Ridge, one of the most successful British offensives of the war. This battle formed a prelude to the Third Battle of Ypres, when the battalion took part in the initial assault on 31 July 1917. Its objectives were to capture the German frontline trench called Jehovah trench, the second line trench called Jordan trench and the remains of Bulgar Wood. These three objectives were , and from the British front line. The battalion managed to capture both trenches and a platoon reached Bulgar Wood before events around them forced a retreat from Bulgar Wood and Jordan trench. The battalion dug in on the Jehovah trench line having lost 11 officers and 258 other ranks as casualties, almost 50% of the battalion strength. After the war, the anniversary of this attack became the main Regimental Day. On 21 March 1918, the 1st Battalion was in front-line trenches near St. Quentin when the German Army launched Operation Michael, the opening attack in their Spring Offensive. The battalion was virtually wiped out, losing 19 officers and 662 men in the attack itself and the withdrawal which followed. The battalion was subsequently re-formed, and in the last weeks of the war in October 1918 took part in the Battle of the Selle, in which it suffered nearly 200 casualties. 137th Brigade (including 1/6th Battalion North Staffs) at the Riqueval Bridge on the St Quentin Canal, October 1918 ;2nd Battalion The 2nd Battalion was one of only eight regular battalions of the British Army to remain in India throughout the war. It took part in operations on the North West Frontier in 1915, as a result of which the regiment was awarded the battle honour \\"North West Frontier, India, 1915\\". Amusingly, the commanding officer at this time was Major Fox and the adjutant Captain Squirell. Although it was a Regular Army battalion, it received very few replacements during the war. From a pre-war establishment strength of a HQ plus eight companies, after the 1915 North West Frontier campaign the battalion comprised only a HQ company and four rifle companies. By 1919 the strength of the regiment was reduced by a third compared to the pre-war establishment with 20 officers and 538 enlisted men on the regimental roll. Over 60% of the enlisted men had joined the battalion since the 1915 campaign and only five officers fought in both the 1915 campaign and the Third Afghan War in 1919. ;1/5th and 1/6th Battalions The 1/5th and 1/6th battalions arrived in France in February 1915 as part of 137th (Staffordshire) Brigade of 46th (North Midland) Division. Among the first Territorial Force units to go to France, these two battalions took part in the 1915 Battle of Loos, especially the battles around the Hohenzollern Redoubt in 1915, and at Gommecourt on the northern flank of the Battle of the Somme. By September 1918 the 1/5th Battalion had been reduced to a cadre and had been transferred away from 46th Division. The 1/6th remained and with the rest of 137th Brigade took part in the storming of the St Quentin Canal. It was a company of the 1/6th Battalion, led by acting Captain A. H. Charlton, that seized the Riqueval Bridge over the St Quentin Canal on 29 September before the Germans could fire the explosive charges, an action for which Charlton was decorated with the Distinguished Service Order. ;12th Battalion The 12th Battalion formed part of 40th Division and served in France on the River Lys during the advance in Flanders (18 August to 6 September 1918) and the Fifth Battle of Ypres, and in France and Belgium during the final weeks of the war. Awards and decorations Altogether, the regiment was awarded 52 battle honours, but it was ruled that only ten could be carried on the colours. =Victoria Crosses= Four Victoria Crosses were awarded to men of the North Staffordshire Regiment during World War I: * Sergeant John Carmichael, 9th Battalion; for gallantry on 8 September 1917 during the Third Battle of Ypres; * Lance-Corporal William Harold Coltman, 1/6th Battalion; for gallantry on the nights of 3 & 4 October 1918 near Sequehart, France; * Acting Lieutenant Colonel Edward Elers Delaval Henderson, 7th Battalion (attached 9th Battalion Royal Warwickshire Regiment); for gallantry on 25 January 1917 in Mesopotamia. This award was made posthumously; * Lance-Corporal John Thomas, 2/5th Battalion for gallantry on 30 November 1917 during the Battle of Cambrai. Reputation for profanity Even by the standards of the British Army, the Regiment (and the 1st Battalion in particular) seems to have gained a reputation during the First World War for profane language. When the 1st Battalion was relieved in the front line following its defence of Delville Wood in September 1916, one of the advanced posts was missed out by mistake. The Lance-Corporal in command, suspecting something was amiss, sent a man back to the front-line trench to investigate. The soldier realised he was at some risk of being shot by his own side, and so \\"when he had crawled within shouting distance he enquired politely but firmly what —— bastards were holding that —— trench. The 9th East Surreys, who were the troops thus addressed, recognised the North Stafford idiom and let him in unhurt\\". Bernard Martin, who served as a 2nd Lieutenant with the 1st Battalion, records another incident which probably took place in 1917, when (very unusually) the battalion was addressed at a church parade by a general, who railed against \\"the disgusting word many of you utter every time you speak. ... I tell you again this indecent word is not to be used any longer. It is so common amongst you that it has become the shameful nickname by which your battalion is known throughout my Division\\". As the parade ended, one soldier was heard to ask, \\"What was that bugger gassing about?\\"; to which another replied, \\"Buggered if I know, I was having a kip. Where's the old bugger gone now?\\". Interwar years (1918–1939) The 1st Battalion was posted to the Curragh, Ireland after the armistice, becoming involved in the Irish War of Independence until 1922, when it moved to Gibraltar. In the following year it was moved to Thrace, where it played a peace-keeping role in the conflict between Greek and Turkish forces. In 1923 it moved to India and remained in the Far East until 1948. The 2nd Battalion was stationed in India in 1919 when Afghan forces crossed the border and occupied some Indian territory, sparking the brief Third Anglo- Afghan War. During this conflict, the battalion was involved very early on, firstly in the investing of Peshawar City, where Afghan sympathisers were mooting a holy war and on 11 May 1919 when they were involved in a bayonet charge on the Afghan forces at Bagh, near Landi Kotal. For their involvement, the regiment received the battle honour \\"Afghanistan NWF 1919\\". The battalion returned to England via Egypt and the Sudan in 1921, and was quickly redeployed to Ireland. On the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, it returned to the regimental depot at Lichfield. Until 1939, it spent time in \\"home stations\\". Apart from England, this included service in Gibraltar from 1930 to 1932 and a year in Palestine in 1936–7. The 3rd and 4th (Special Reserve) Battalions were placed in suspended animation in 1921, finally being disbanded in 1953. The Territorial Force was reconstituted as the Territorial Army in 1920, and the 5th and 6th battalions were reformed, still with the 137th (Staffordshire) Brigade of 46th (North Midland) Division. In 1936, the 5th Battalion was converted to an anti-aircraft searchlight unit of the Royal Engineers as 41st (North Staffordshire Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Battalion while remaining 'part of the corps of the North Staffordshire Regiment'. It was transferred to the Royal Artillery in August 1940 as the 41st (5th North Staffordshire) Searchlight Regiment TA. In the same year the remaining 6th Battalion was transferred to 166th Infantry Brigade, 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division after the HQ of the 46th Division became 2nd Anti-Aircraft Division. Throughout the spring and summer of 1939, due to the increasing threat posed by Nazi Germany, the size of the Territorial Army was doubled, and the 6th Battalion formed a duplicate 7th Battalion. In 1921, the regimental title was altered to The North Staffordshire Regiment (The Prince of Wales's).Army Order 509/1920 In 1937, the black facings formerly worn by the 64th Foot were restored, replacing the white colour that had been imposed on all non-royal English regiments in 1881.G.O. 41/1881 1 May 1881 amended by G.O.70/1881 1 July 1881. \\"X. The facings, and the Officers lace will be the same for all regiments belonging to the same Country (Royal and Rifle Regiments excepted), and will as follows: English Regiments: Facings – White, Pattern of Lace – Rose\\" The London, Midland and Scottish Railway renamed one of their Royal Scot class locomotives, number 6141 (formerly Caledonian), after the regiment. Second World War (1939–1945) In September 1939, the North Staffordshire Regiment consisted of two Regular and two Territorial battalions – the 1st and 2nd Regular and the 6th and 7th Territorials. Following the outbreak of the Second World War on 3 September 1939, the regiment was expanded as it had been during the First World War. This expansion, however, was limited this time only to the addition of two more battalions – the 8th and 9th battalions, of which both were raised in 1940 but later converted to other roles. The roles of the two regular battalions were reversed this time, with the 1st Battalion serving in India and Burma throughout the war, while the 2nd Battalion remained in Italy and North Africa. The North Staffordshire Regiment was awarded 22 battle honours for the Second World War but, as at the end of the First World War, only 10 could be displayed on the colours. Regular Army The 1st Battalion was in British India on the outbreak of the Second World War and saw no action until 1942, when one company that was stationed on the Andaman Islands were involved in the defence of the islands during the Japanese invasion. In 1943, the battalion served for six months in Burma, with the 36th Indian Infantry Brigade, part of the 26th Indian Infantry Division, before being withdrawn to India again. For the rest of the war, the battalion was employed mainly on internal security duties and saw no further action. Troops of the 2nd Battalion on exercise with the Royal Tank Regiment in France, 1940 The 2nd Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Donald Butterworth, was sent to France shortly after the outbreak of war in September 1939 as part of the 2nd Infantry Brigade (alongside the 1st Loyal Regiment and 1st Gordon Highlanders), 1st Infantry Division and was part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), and was involved in the battles of France and Belgium before eventually being evacuated from Dunkirk on 1 June 1940. Following that, the 2nd Battalion spent years on home defence in the United Kingdom preparing for a possible German invasion of England which never arrived. The battalion remained in the United Kingdom until 1943 when, still as part of 1st Infantry Division, it sailed to North Africa and took part in the campaign in Tunisia, British First Army. The battalion did not participate in the invasion of Sicily or the initial invasion of Italy but was one of the lead units in the Anzio landings in January 1944, under command of US Fifth Army, where they suffered extremely heavy casualties. On 7 February the battalion suffered 323 casualties attempting to capture Buonriposo Ridge which they captured but were forced to surrender the ridge after expending their ammunition. By May, following Operation Diadem, the battalion had absorbed eight drafts of replacements. Now fighting as part of the British Eighth Army, the 2nd Battalion continued to serve in Italy, fighting around the Gothic Line, until January 1945 when the battalion and the rest of 1st Infantry Division were transferred to Palestine. Territorial Army The 41st (5th North Staffordshire Regiment) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Engineers, previously the 5th North Staffords, served in Anti-Aircraft Command as part of the air defence of the Midlands from 1939 to 1944. The regiment became the first complete searchlight regiment to land in Normandy after the D-Day landings of 6 June 1944. It served with 21st Army Group, as part of 31st (North Midland) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, until the end of the war in Europe and then undertook garrison duty in Lower Saxony.41 AA Bn RE/41 SL Rgt RA War Diaries, August 1939–December 1945, The National Archives (TNA), Kew files WO 166/3059, WO 166/7792, WO 166/11502, WO 166/14873, WO 171/1203, WO 171/5089. The two Territorial battalions formed part of 176th Infantry Brigade (which included both the 6th and 7th North Staffords and the 7th South Staffords) of 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division. The division trained in the United Kingdom for many years until it landed in Normandy in June 1944 as part of Operation Overlord where they fought in the Battle for Caen and gained an excellent reputation during Operation Charnwood and the Second Battle of the Odon. However, only the 6th Battalion landed in France as the 7th Battalion had been transferred elsewhere in 1942, being replaced in the 176th Brigade by the 7th Royal Norfolks. The 6th Battalion had been in France for less than two months when, in August 1944, along with other infantry units of 59th Division, it was broken up to supply replacements to other British units, due to a severe shortage of infantry replacements throughout the Army at the time. The 7th Battalion, upon leaving 59th Division, served with the 207th and 228th Infantry brigades in the Orkney and Shetland islands in 1943–1945, and later the 25th Brigade, before being transferred in 1945 as an administrative unit in the 183rd Brigade within the 61st Infantry Division and, in 1945 after the war in Europe was over, was preparing for a move to the Far East to fight the Japanese but they surrendered before the division arrived. The battalion was disbanded after the war in 1947. Hostilities-only The 8th Battalion was initially raised as a training battalion in 1940 and was assigned to the 205th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home) and was mainly concerned in home defence duties. The 8th Battalion was transferred to the Royal Artillery in March 1942 and converted to the 180th Field Regiment. The regiment served with the 48th Infantry (Reserve) Division in a training role until it was disbanded in August 1944. The 9th Battalion was, like the 8th Battalion, also initially raised as a training battalion, and was assigned to the 224th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home). The 9th Battalion was transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps in December 1941, becoming 154th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps, retaining their North Staffords cap badge on the black beret of the Royal Armoured Corps, as did all other infantry units converted in this way. The regiment was assigned to 36th Army Tank Brigade alongside RAC regiments converted from infantry battalions. However, the regiment was disbanded in July 1943. Postwar service (1945–1959) Following the independence of India in 1947, all infantry regiments in the British Army were reduced to a single regular battalion. Accordingly, the 1st Battalion left India to take part in a ceremony officially amalgamating with the 2nd Battalion in Egypt in 1948. The new 1st Battalion remained in Egypt until 1950, when it returned to the depot in Staffordshire. A year later, the battalion was posted to the disputed port city of Trieste. In 1953, the battalion was transferred to Korea, where they were stationed on garrison duties as part of the United Nations force established at the end of the Korean War. In 1954, it moved to Hong Kong, where the regiment's 200th anniversary was celebrated in 1956. Amalgamation In July 1957, a defence review was announced, which resulted in the amalgamation of the North Staffordshire Regiment with the South Staffordshire Regiment, with the new regiment becoming part of the new administrative Mercian Brigade. The amalgamation of the 1st Battalions of the two regiments took place on 31 January 1959 at Minden, Germany, to form the 1st Battalion, Staffordshire Regiment (The Prince of Wales's). In 1947, 41 Searchlight Regiment was reformed in the Territorial Army as 576 (5th Bn, The North Staffordshire Regiment) Searchlight Regiment RA (TA), later becoming 576 Light Anti-Aircraft/Searchlight Regiment (576 LAA/SL). When AA Command was disbanded in 1955 and the number of air defence units reduced, 576 LAA/SL Regiment was amalgamated with 349 (Lancashire Yeomanry) LAA and 493 Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiments as 441 LAA/SL Regiment. The 6th Battalion continued as a Territorial unit of the new regiment without a change of title. In 1961, it merged with the 441st Light Anti Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, the successor to the 5th North Staffords, to become the 5th/6th Battalion. The combined battalion was abolished in 1967 on the creation of the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve in 1967. The Staffordshire Regiment only had a separate existence from 1959–2007. As part of the reforms proposed in the 2003 Defence White Paper, Delivering Security in a Changing World, the regiment was merged with the Cheshire Regiment and the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment to form the Mercian Regiment. The amalgamation took place on 1 September 2007 in Tamworth Castle Grounds, when the Staffordshire Regiment became the 3rd Battalion, the Mercian Regiment. Subsequently, in 2014, The Mercian Regiment reduced its number of regular battalions from three to two, with the 3rd Battalion being disbanded and the personnel being redeployed into the 1st and 2nd Battalions. Regimental museum The Staffordshire Regiment Museum is based at Whittington Barracks near Lichfield. Battle honours The following lists all battle honours awarded to the Regiment or inherited by the regiment from the 64th Foot and 98th Foot. Prior to 1914 all battle honours awarded to a unit were displayed upon the colours. However the number of battle honours awarded during the First World War was such that it was ordered that no more than 24 honours were to be carried on the colours, of which no more than 10 were to be honours relating to the First World War.Army Order 338/1922 paragraph 1(d). Similarly, following the Second World War it was ordered that up to 10 honours relating to that conflict could be displayed on the colours, in addition to honours already carried.Army Council Instruction 58/1956 paragraph 5.

He specialized in obstetrics and gynaecology, and contributed significant research to the field of women's health, in particular about menopause and hormone replacement therapy. Judd was born in Los Angeles to George and Emmeline Judd. His father was an obstetrician, and his older brother Lewis went on to become chairman of the psychiatry department of University of California, San Diego. Howard went on to study medicine at George Washington University after attending Occidental College and Brigham Young University. Judd completed his residency in obstetrics and gynaecology at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and later trained in endocrinology at Massachusetts General Hospital. In 1970, he joined the medical faculty at the University of California, San Diego, and later in 1977 joined the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He would remain at the university until his retirement in 2005, and became a professor of obstetrics and gynecology, and the executive director of the division of reproductive endocrinology and infertility. In his early research, Judd and his collaborators showed that the ovaries of postmenopausal women could secrete amounts of androgen, which can act as precursors to estrogen. He then began investigating the physiology of hot flushes, a characteristic symptom of menopause. He developed techniques to monitor the onset and severity of hot flushes, using electrodes to measure rises in skin temperature due to vasodilation, and pulse rate. These objective measurements of hot flushes later assisted in assessing the effectiveness of treatments mitigating the signs and symptoms of menopause, including hormone replacement therapy. He led the first trials demonstrating the efficacy and safety of the transdermal estrogen patch known as Estraderm. From the 1990s until 2005 he was a principal researcher for the Women's Health Initiative, a trial investigating important health issues in older women, including menopause and hormone replacement therapy. The trial was halted in 2002 following results showing that women on hormone replacement therapy were at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. Judd maintained that estrogen would in fact benefit some people, a position which researchers eventually adopted after further study. Howard Judd died of congestive heart failure in his Santa Monica Home, and was survived by his wife Susan Judd and his three daughters.

He was one of the three most prominent members of the first generation of the Hlebine School. Virius was born in the village of Đelekovec near Koprivnica, where he completed four years of primary school. In the First World War, he fought as an Austro-Hungarian soldier in Galicia. He was captured by Russians and made a forced laborer in Kiev, Kharkiv and the Ekaterinoslav iron plant. He returned from Russia in the spring of 1918 and remained in Zagreb until the war ended. Virius then went home to Đelekovec, where he lived in penury and married a war widow with two children. He became a member of the progressive peasant movement, led by the Croatian Peasant Party. In 1936, the writer Mihovil Pavlek Miškina introduced him to the painters from Hlebine, Ivan Generalić and Franjo Mraz. They were the first generation of the Croatian naïve art movement, the Hlebine School. Virius was a self-taught painter, who started painting late in life. In just three years (1936–39) he created an impressive body of work. He participated in the First Exhibition of Peasant Painters in Zagreb. Virius made watercolors, drawings and oils. His opus is dominated by expressive and bleak depictions of social themes - peasant labor, the soil, poor villagers - best shown in paintings such as The Beggar, The Plowing, The Red Bull, The Overturned Cart, The Flour Exchange Office. The prominent lines, the purity and elegance of his drawings prompted the critic Josip Depolo to call him \\"the Giotto of Podravina\\". In the Second World War, Virius was arrested because of his Communist political activities and taken to a Croatian Ustash Nazi concentration camp in Zemun, where he died. His tragic fate was immortalized by his friend Generalić, who painted The Death of Virius, one of his most famous paintings.

Certain types of light can cause film and digital cameras to render a colour cast. Illuminating a subject with light sources of different colour temperatures will usually cause colour cast problems in the shadows. The human eye generally does not notice the unnatural colour, because our eyes and brains adjust and compensate for different types of light in ways that cameras cannot. In film, colour casts can also be caused by problems in photo development. Improper timing or imbalanced chemical mixtures can cause unwanted casts. Colour casts can also occur in old photographs due to fading of dyes, particularly under the action of ultraviolet light. These may be correctable on a scanned version of the photograph with image editing techniques. Solutions Example of a photo with a uniformly green colour cast due to differential absorption of light before reaching certain depths at sea. The same photo with the colour cast corrected Most digital cameras try to automatically detect and compensate colour cast and usually have a selection of manually set white balance settings to choose from. Otherwise, photo editing programs, such as Photoshop, often have built in colour correction facilities. For film, blue filters and amber filters are used to counter casts. Amber filters are used to reduce the blueish tint caused by daylight. Blue filters reduce the orange colour caused by incandescent light. A variety of coloured filters in varying degrees of intensity are available. Kodak's amber filters, for example, vary from palest yellow (\\"81C\\") to deepest amber (\\"85B\\"). A photographer chooses which filter to use based on the quality of the ambient light. Colour temperature meters can read the temperature of the existing lighting conditions and guide the selection of the filter. Clouded sky, for example, requires a paler amber than clear blue sky. If a filter is unavailable, flash is an alternative solution which usually provides enough neutral white light to counter the cast. In the case of film, if photographs all contain the same cast, it is usually indicative of improper chemical development.

Over time, it has become one of the largest Christian organizations in Europe for children's aid. Today it supports almost 2 million children and young people in 31 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. KNH aims to give needy children in the poorest countries of the world a chance to a good start in life. That means a basic school education and vocational training, good nutrition and health care, as well as community- oriented support to the families of the children. KNH works together with partner organizations located abroad, usually churches, congregations or Christian organizations. However, the support of children is always granted irrespective of religion. The head office is in Duisburg. Here, staff members and volunteers coordinate the work abroad and carry out administrative, educational and lobby work as well as launch publicity campaigns.  Finances = Donors  KNH is a registered charitable organization and a member of the Diaconic Services of the Evangelical Church in Germany. More than 90 percent of the work is financed through donations from 245.000 people who support Kindernothilfe. KNH heeds its Christian values and responsibilities as reflected in the life of Jesus.  Child sponsorships  Child sponsorships is Kindernothilfe's most important aid form which can accompany children until they become responsible for themselves.  Grants and subsidies  As well as this, it receives subsidies from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Co-operation and Development (BMZ) and from the European Union as well as church grants: It also benefits from the payment of fines.  Seal of approval  Every year since 1992 Kindernothilfe has received the DZI seal of approval. This is awarded by the German Central Institute for Social Affairs (DZI) to charity organisations that uses the money received in a reliable, transparent and responsible manner.  Foundation  Kindernothilfe started the Kindernothilfe Foundation in 1999. The chairman of the foundation committee is Dr. Norbert Blüm, a former cabinet minister. The yields from the foundation capital of approx. 6.3 million Euro flow directly into Kindernothilfe projects. Kindernothilfe works on national and international levels by joining alliances, co-operating with networks and other organisations to achieve a global improvement of economic, social and political structural conditions. It participates in campaigns or initiates its own campaigns. Kindernothilfe is above all committed to the implementation of the UN Convention on the Right of the Child which forms an important base for its work. At the beginning of 2004 Kindernothilfe was granted consultative status with the economic council and social council (ECOSOC) and this now enables it to draw more attention to the needs of children.

The race was the eighth round of the inaugural World Touring Car Championship, and was the 28th in a sequence of Bathurst 1000 races, commencing with the 1960 Armstrong 500 held at Phillip Island. The race was shortened from 163 laps to 161 for 1987, when the track was slightly lengthened by the addition of the Caltex Chase, a chicane which was built in response to the death of Mike Burgmann in an accident during the previous year's race. The addition of The Chase saw lap times increase by approximately 4–5 seconds over those in 1986. The Chase was also meant to slow the cars down, but the speed of the new breed of Group A cars (specifically the turbocharged Ford Sierra RS500), saw the fastest cars (Eggenberger Motorsport) reaching higher speeds () on the shortened straight than had been achieved on the full length straight in 1986 (the fastest car on the full straight in 1986, the Holden VK Commodore SS Group A, was recorded at ). The straight line speed of the new Sierras was comparable to those the Australian Group C cars were reaching by 1984. The 1987 race was provisionally won by the Ford- supported Eggenberger Motorsport team, with Steve Soper and Pierre Dieudonné taking the chequered flag in their Ford Sierra RS500, two laps ahead of teammates Klaus Ludwig and Klaus Niedzwiedz. Third was the best of the locally based teams, the HDT Racing entered Holden VL Commodore SS Group A driven by Peter McLeod, Peter Brock and David Parsons. Protests lodged before the race James Hardie results sooner than planned, Australian Auto Action, 9 October 1987, page 3 significantly affected the official results, which were not finalised until well into 1988. The two Eggenberger cars were disqualified for illegally modified front wheel arch guards, which allowed the cars to race on taller tires. The team appealed their disqualification as far as the appeals process allowed, the FIA's court of appeal. Eventually the disqualifications were upheld and McLeod, Brock and Parsons were declared race winners. It was a record ninth Bathurst 1000 victory for Brock and his final victory in the race. For McLeod and Parsons it would be their only win at Bathurst. McLeod's nominated co-driver Jon Crooke failed to get a start after the Brock/Parsons car failed on lap 34 and the pair moved into the team's second car. McLeod had been a last-minute draftee into the team as Crooke's Sandown 500 co-driver Neil Crompton was unable to get his racing licence upgraded in time for the race. The disqualifications saw the factory Nissan team promoted into a second and third team result, which would remain the best ever performance by a Japanese manufacturer until Nissan's first win in 1991. It was the first time the winner of this event had not led one lap of the race. The winning #10 HDT Commodore started the race in 20th position with a time of 2:25.12 set by Peter Brock. Brock had also qualified his own #05 Commodore in 11th place. As Brock had already qualified his own car his time should not have counted as the fastest qualifying time for car #10. Had the stewards of the meeting followed procedure, the McLeod/Crooke Commodore should have started from 27th on the basis of Jon Crooke's time of 2:27.00 (McLeod's best time the car was a 2:27.96). A similar situation had occurred for the HDT in 1986 following Allan Moffat's crash in the 05 Commodore. Brock had then qualified the team's second car with a time that was good enough for second place (faster than his own car), but his time did not count towards a grid placing. Subsequently, when the wheel arches of the Sierras were declared illegal during practice for the final round at Fuji in Japan. The Texaco team then made them legal before qualifying and the West German pairing of Ludwig and Niedzwiedz went on to win the race. Class 2 provided a 1-2 result for the Australian-based JPS Team BMW, with the BMW M3 of Jim Richards and Tony Longhurst leading home the similar car of teammates Robbie Francevic and the team's engine builder Ludwig Finauer. In third place was the first of the BMW Motorsport entered BMW M3s, the CiBiEmme car of Johnny Cecotto and Gianfranco Brancatelli. The CiBiEmme BMW was the leading registered World Touring Car Championship entry, its seventh outright placing matching the result achieved by the best placed WTCC- registered entry in the season opening Monza 500. These two results stood as the equal lowest race placings by the top finishing registered entry at any round of the 1987 championship (both the Monza and Bathurst races had seen the original winning teams disqualified). Class 3 had only one finisher (finishing 23rd and last outright), the Bob Holden Motors Toyota Sprinter driven by 1966 Gallaher 500 winner Bob Holden and his co-drivers Garry Willmington and Bryan Bate. At the time that both of the Team Toyota Australia cars that were leading the class crashed out on the top of The Mountain, Bob Holden's car was some 20 laps behind having had numerous early problems. One record that was set in the race was its youngest ever driver. Graham Gulson, the 17-year-old son of long-time touring car driver and Bathurst regular Ray Gulson, made his mountain debut alongside his father in the teams ex-JPS Team BMW 635 CSi. Graham easily qualified for the race and acquitted himself well in illustrious company during his one stint at the wheel in the race. The Gulson family BMW finished 15th outright and 10th in class, completing 146 laps to be 12 laps down at the finish. Due to the number of laps behind the safety car and the rain which slowed lap times by approximately 20 seconds, the race lasted for 7:01:08.40. This was the first event since the rain affected 1974 race that the race took more than 7 hours to be completed. Classes Cars competed in three classes conforming to World Touring Car Championship regulations: Class 1 The outright category was for cars with an engine capacity over 2500cc. The class consisted of BMW 635 CSi, Ford Sierra RS500, Holden Commodore, Maserati Biturbo, Mitsubishi Starion, Nissan Skyline and Toyota Supra.Entry List, 1987 James Hardie 1000, Official Program, pages 88 & 89 Class 2 The middle class was for cars with an engine capacity from 1601 to 2500cc. The class consisted of Alfa Romeo 75, BMW M3, Mercedes-Benz 190E and Nissan Gazelle. Class 3 The baby car class was for cars with an engine capacity from 1001 to 1600cc. It consisted of a variety of Toyota Corollas and a single Alfa Romeo 33. Hardies Heroes The Top 10 runoff for pole position was a one off event in the World Touring Car Championship. FISA initially objected to it but were ultimately powerless to stop it as it was written into the race regulations by the event promoters, the Australian Racing Driver's Club (ARDC).

With the addition of the new \\"Caltex Chase\\" complex on Conrod straight, lap times were around 4–5 seconds slower in 1987 than before. The general feeling was that Ludwig's pole time would have been even faster than George Fury's record 1984 pole time of 2:13.85 had the Chase not been there. * 1987 was Ford's first pole position at Bathurst since Allan Moffat claimed pole in his XB Falcon in 1976. It was also Ford's first front row start at Bathurst since Dick Johnson started second in 1981 in an XD Falcon, and the first time that Ford outnumbered other makes in the shootout. * With Ludwig on pole and Andy Rouse second, 1987 was the first time in race history that two Bathurst rookies had occupied the front row of the grid since qualifying times first counted for grid positions in 1967, though Rouse had been previously entered in 1976 but did not arrive, and one of his co-drivers was four time Great Race winner Allan Moffat, who was having his first race in a Ford since 1980. * The two Dick Johnson Racing Sierras of Dick Johnson and Charlie O'Brien were had their times disallowed after failing a fuel check following the shootout. The team had mistakenly used fuel churns that had been filled at the team base in Brisbane and not at the track. It was of an inferior grade and actually made the engines produce less power than normal, but the penalty stood. * Dick Johnson was contesting his tenth consecutive Hardie's Heroes, being the only driver to have contested each one since its inception in 1978. * The #12 Texaco Sierra driven by Klaus Niedzwiedz was withdrawn from the race following the shootout, with Niedzwiedz being Ludwig's nominated co-driver in the #7 Sierra. All qualified cars behind then moved up one place on the grid. * 1987 was the first Hardies Heroes that Peter Brock failed to qualify for after qualifying twelfth. He did not appear in the 1986 shootout due to the car still being repaired following Allan Moffat's Friday crash, but Brock had qualified second before the crash. * Giving lie to the myth that you had to be a Bathurst regular to go fast on The Mountain, 5 European based drivers qualified for the shootout. Klaus Ludwig, Andy Rouse, Steve Soper, Klaus Niedzwiedz (the top 4) and Johnny Cecotto. Only Soper (1984) and 1985 Rookie of the Year Cecotto had previously raced at Bathurst.

These catalogues are commonly known in the numismatic trade as the Pick catalogues, as the numbering system was originally compiled by Albert Pick, but are also referred to as \\"Krause\\" or \\"SCWPM.\\" Since the mid-1980s the titles have been owned by Krause Publications, and from 1994–2016 were under the editorship of George S. Cuhaj, and subsequently by Tracy L. Schmidt. Numbering system The numbering system uses an integer to identify a note. The sorting of notes is usually by issue series/date, then ascending by denomination. Some varieties also have an alphabetic prefix, with a capital letter or letters. * A prefix of \\"A\\" or \\"B\\" is used to insert older series which were not cataloged when the numbering system was established. * A prefix of \\"CS\\" is used for made-for-collector merchandise such as souvenir folders, uncut pairs/strips/sheets, special serial numbers, booklets, etc.; the numbers after \\"CS\\" are sometimes sequential (1, 2, 3, etc.) in which case these products are listed after all regular notes, and other times are the equivalent of the normal note, in which case these items are listed right after the regular version of each note. * A prefix of \\"FX\\" is used for Foreign Exchange Certificates. * A prefix of \\"M\\" designates military issues (often occupation issues, or military scrip); these have been moved to the \\"Specialized\\" catalog. * A prefix of \\"R\\" is used for certain regional notes, which have also been moved to the \\"Specialized\\" catalog. * A prefix of \\"S\\" is used to represent \\"Specialized\\" issues which are cataloged separately (often, though inconsistently, private banks, regional issues, emergency issues, local notes, etc.). In common usage, but not in the catalog itself, it is a common practice to prefix \\"P\\" to the catalog number (and any prefixes or suffixes, to designate that this is a \\"Pick\\" number; however, this is not a practice of the catalog themselves. If there are prefixes, in this usage, they will follow the \\"P\\" (e.g. \\"P5,\\" \\"PS101a,\\" \\"PM3\\" or \\"PFX\\"). Inconsistently, if a note has signature or date or other variants, then a lower case letter follows (e.g. P120a, P120b, P120c, etc.); in some cases though, multiple dates are assigned to a single variant; e.g. \\"1936–1940; 1942; 1945.\\" From edition to edition, these variety letters may change, as additional dates and signatures are found, and as the editors decide to add more granularity. * A suffix of \\"ct\\" is used for color trial proofs (sometimes listed as \\"tc\\") * A suffix of \\"r\\" is used for either a \\"remainder\\" (mostly 19th century incomplete printings) or a \\"replacement\\" note. * A suffix of \\"p\\" is used for \\"proof\\" notes. * A suffix of \\"s\\" is used for \\"specimen\\" notes. * A suffix of \\"tc\\" is used for \\"trial color proofs\\". * A suffix of \\"x\\" is used to denote certain varieties, such as counterfeits or errors. Where there are multiple versions of proofs, remainders or specimens, and occasionally other variations, they are often cataloged with a number after the letter, e.g. \\"p1\\", \\"p2\\", \\"s1\\" or \\"s2\\". If a number needs to be inserted between two numbers, then in some cases, the section is renumbered—which creates confusion, and some collectors will annotate this with the previous number in parentheses .. e.g. 6(5) would indicate the current Pick number is 6, but it was once 5. But in other cases, the entries are not renumbered, and then the format is to use a suffix capital letter (e.g. P120A).

This is meant in two distinct senses: static replication, where the portfolio has the same cash flows as the reference asset (and no changes need to be made to maintain this), and dynamic replication, where the portfolio does not have the same cash flows, but has the same \\"Greeks\\" as the reference asset, meaning that for small (properly, infinitesimal) changes to underlying market parameters, the price of the asset and the price of the portfolio change in the same way. Dynamic replication requires continual adjustment, as the asset and portfolio are only assumed to behave similarly at a single point (mathematically, their partial derivatives are equal at a single point). Given an asset or liability, an offsetting replicating portfolio (a \\"hedge\\") is called a static hedge or dynamic hedge, and constructing such a portfolio (by selling or purchasing) is called static hedging or dynamic hedging. The notion of a replicating portfolio is fundamental to rational pricing, which assumes that market prices are arbitrage-free – concretely, arbitrage opportunities are exploited by constructing a replicating portfolio. In practice, replicating portfolios are seldom, if ever, exact replications. Most significantly, unless they are claims against the same counterparties, there is credit risk. Further, dynamic replication is invariably imperfect, since actual price movements are not infinitesimal – they may in fact be large – and transaction costs to change the hedge are not zero. Applications=Derivatives pricing Dynamic replication is fundamental to the Black–Scholes model of derivatives pricing, which assumes that derivatives can be replicated by portfolios of other securities, and thus their prices determined. See explication under Rational pricing #The replicating portfolio. In limited cases static replication is sufficient, notably in put–call parity. An important technical detail is how cash is treated. Most often one considers a self-financing portfolio, where any required cash (such as for premium payments) is borrowed, and excess cash is loaned. Insurance In the valuation of a life insurance company, the actuary considers a series of future uncertain cashflows (including incoming premiums and outgoing claims, for example) and attempts to put a value on these cashflows. There are many ways of calculating such a value (such as a net premium valuation), but these approaches are often arbitrary in that the interest rate chosen for discounting is itself rather arbitrarily chosen. One possible approach, and one that is gaining increasing attention, is the use of replicating portfolios or hedge portfolios. The theory is that we can choose a portfolio of assets (fixed interest bonds, zero coupon bonds, index-linked bonds, etc.) whose cashflows are identical to the magnitude and the timing of the cashflows to be valued. For example, suppose your cash flows over a 7-year period are, respectively, $2, $2, $2, $50, $2, $2, $102. You could buy a $100 seven-year bond with a 2% dividend, and a four-year zero-coupon bond with a maturity value of 48. The market price of those two instruments (that is, the cost of buying this simple replicating portfolio) might be $145 - and therefore the value of the cashflows is also taken to be $145 (as opposed to the face value of the total cash flows at the conclusion of the 7 years, which is $162). Such a construction, which requires only fixed-income securities, is even possible for participating contracts (at least when bonuses are based on the performance of the backing assets). The proof relies on a fixed point argument. It should be clear that the advantages of a replicating portfolio approach include: * an arbitrary discount rate is not required * the term structure of interest rates is automatically taken into account. Valuing options and guarantees can require complex nested stochastic calculations. Replicating portfolios can be set up to replicate such options and guarantees. It may be easier to value the replicating portfolio than to value the underlying feature (options and guarantees). For example, bonds and equities can be used to replicate a call option. The call option can then be easily valued as the value of the bond/equity portfolio, hence not requiring one to value the call option directly.

History He was born in Palermo. After completing regular artistic studies, Crivello travelled and worked both in Italy and internationally. His artistic activity has ranged from painting to graphic design to comics: in 1975 he began to exhibit his art and to collaborate with various editors in producing graphic art pages, book illustrations and comic strips. Beginning in 1986 he worked as an independent cartoonist and professional illustrator for the Giornale di Sicilia and since 1987 he has completed various works of public art. During his career Crivello has worked with Dino Buzzati and was associated with the painter Renato Guttuso and with the poet Giacomo Giardina. Crivello serves as Staff Lecturer at the National Art School in Monreale. Before taking on this role in 1997, he had already founded the Scuola siciliana del fumetto (Sicilian School of Cartooning), an unstructured not-for-profit institution with no official staff. Prior to the school's closing in 2001 at Crivello's behest, it offered free mini-courses, exhibitions and seminars on Sequential and Visual Art, aimed at preventing teenage drop-out and disengagement while encouraging young people to continue their studies in school. After some years Crivello turned to painting, producing cycles of works dedicated to imaginary characters of the world of fables and stories. In 2004, with the four-panel story Crash Day, a free interpretation of the tragic September 11th attack in New York, Crivello's students Riccardo Ferrigno and Luciano Spaccapietra won the Comic Stories (Fumetto Stories) prize of the Dervio International Cartoons and Comics Festival in the secondary school division.2004 Dervio International Cartoons and Comics Festival, www.dervio.org Crivello organized exhibitions and demonstrations (connected to educational activities) with the sponsorship of the city of Palermo and the Sicilian Regional Labor Council and Tourism Council, of which the most noteworthy were the International Exhibition on Pinocchio, and the pre-release exhibition show against the Mafia, Mafia: Architecture of a Pain, dedicated to the memory of the judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. The struggle against the Mafia is a subject of great concern to Crivello. Also noteworthy is the publication of the mini-series The Excellent Ones, comic strips dedicated to victims of the Mafia, illustrated by Crivello's students and sponsored by the Regional Province of Palermo in 2000. Crivello's current projects include one on mobbing: THE MOB. This project foresees an exhibition of illustrations and the publication of a minibook with the history of mobbing, as well as its causes and effects, with texts by various authors collected in Palermo in February 2007.

Overview  \\"Crosshope\\" is a punk rock influenced death metal song which incorporates Killing Joke type punk shouting vocals. Many know the song because in 2000 Markus \\"Black Raven\\" Vainionpää won The Annual Air Guitar World Championship contest by performing \\"Crosshope\\"..

The Lyrics of the song ponder about the endless circle and paradox of wars and what they reveal about the very nature of man's being. \\"Tribal Eagle\\" is a black metal influenced song which begins with an epic guitar melody, followed by chorus sung with clean vocals, the rest of the vocals being high-pitched shrieking. The lyrics of \\"Tribal Eagle\\" tell metaphorically about an eagle tattoo which is tied up in skin (World) with black ink (sin) and therefore cannot fly freely. \\"Blue Moment\\" is another black metal influenced song which incorporates some clean female vocals by Eeva Vehniäinen. The concept of the song is about a moment on a winter day during sunset when the nature seems blue for a short while. In this song it refers to a sad, depressing moment in one's life when an individual is uncertain whether tomorrow will come or not.

He has represented Thailand at full international level. Career Born in Plymouth, Devon, Waite later moved to Coddenham, Suffolk. Waite represented Ipswich Town, Colchester United, Fulham and Ipswich Wanderers at youth level, appearing in and around the first team for the latter. Waite, the son of a British father and Thai mother, began his career as a junior in Thailand and made his debut for the national side aged just 15 years and 354 days when he came on as a second-half substitute in a game against Singapore in Bangkok. His form for the Thai national team attracted the attention of Rotherham United with who Waite started a three-year scholarship in 2003. He left Rotherham after just one year and subsequently played for a number of clubs, including Braintree Town, Leyton and Woking, before joining Kettering Town, and then moving on to Barrow in January 2005. He left Barrow to join Stevenage Borough in March 2005. He joined Cambridge United in August 2005, joining Chelmsford City on loan in September 2005 and moving to AFC Sudbury in January 2006. Waite joined Milton Keynes Dons in July 2006. He was unable to break into the Dons first team and was released in January 2007. During his time at Milton Keynes found a cancer of the lymph glands and underwent a 10-month chemotherapy programme before being given the all-clear. In August 2007, Waite signed on non-contract terms for Conference South side St Albans City, before moving to Bradford City on 21 November 2007 and playing in a reserve game on the same day against Hartlepool United. In March 2008 he joined Conference National side Droylsden on a loan deal. On 29 April 2008, Waite was deemed to be surplus to requirements at Valley Parade and was released by manager Stuart McCall along with 13 other Bradford players. He never featured for Bradford. On 2 September 2008, he signed for Doncaster Rovers on a non-contract basis following a trial at the club. He was recommended to Doncaster by ex-player Barry Richardson after Waite was trained by him at Nottingham Forest. After less than a month with Rovers, he was released after failing to win a permanent contract. He signed for Harlow Town in the summer of 2009, and left the club later that year. He joined Lowestoft Town ahead of the 2016–17 season.

Scotland's record win was the first match of the competition and saw hat- tricks by Sandy \\"Duke\\" McMahon and Robert Hamilton. In their second game however Scotland could not sustain their good form, resulting in a disappointing draw with a tough Welsh side who played well to gain their point. England entered the action next with a victory over the Irish, although the men in green limited the damage to just a three-goal deficit. England then took the lead in the competition with a heavy 6–0 win over Wales, Steve Bloomer scoring four. In the final matches, Ireland and Wales played for pride, neither side being able at this stage to win the trophy. Wales eventually won the match 1–0. England and Scotland however fought out a furious encounter as both sides stood a good chance of winning.

It was released as a single in the UK in February 1979, but failed to chart. It was written by Philip Oakey, Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh; was produced by Colin Thurston and featured guest backing vocalists Katie Kissoon and Lisa Strike (who later worked with Pink Floyd ). After hastily signing the Human League in 1978 it became apparent to Virgin Records that the band were not very profitable, with none of their releases under Fast Records making any impact on the charts. Virgin began putting pressure on the group to justify their large advance signing fee. Pressure was put on Ware, Oakey and Marsh to abandon their no traditional instruments rule and use conventional instruments in an attempt to be more commercial and sell more records.THE HUMAN LEAGUE Blind Youth - the complete guide to The Human League 1977-1980 Ware reluctantly agreed but insisted that any material recorded this way should be released under a pseudonym to ensure that it wasn't confused with the pure electronic sound of The Human League. \\"I Don't Depend on You\\" was the only product of this compromise with Virgin. It was recorded with the addition of session musicians and was released under the name The Men. The song also features the synth riff from debut single Being Boiled towards the end of the track. Afterwards the band were able to record tracks in their original style for Virgin. Before any further conventional style records could be recorded, the original Human League had split; Oakey then took the new reformed band down a different commercial and pop route.HUMAN LEAGUE BIOG 1977 - 1979 Later, it would be commented on that in recording \\"I Don’t Depend on You\\" – two years prior to the arrival of schoolgirl vocalists Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall – Oakey, Ware and Marsh had already produced a Human League Mk 2-style track complete with commercial pop sound: Oakey's vocal with female backing (with Katie Kissoon and Lisa Strike providing the backing vocals). NME commented on this in 1990: The B-side, titled \\"Cruel\\", is simply a remix of \\"I Don’t Depend on You\\" without Oakey's vocals. \\"I Don’t Depend on You\\" received little promotion or airplay and did not chart. Re-releases on albums now credit the track as The Human League aka 'The Men'. Hot Gossip version British dance troupe Hot Gossip covered this song in 1981 for their album Geisha Boys and Temple Girls which was produced by Martyn Ware. The album was a commercial failure.

Puck of Pook's Hill is a fantasy book by Rudyard Kipling,Rudyard Kipling biography published in 1906, containing a series of short stories set in different periods of English history. It can count both as historical fantasy – since some of the stories told of the past have clear magical elements, and as contemporary fantasy – since it depicts a magical being active and practising his magic in the England of the early 1900s when the book was written. The stories are all narrated to two children living near Burwash, in the High Weald of Sussex, in the area of Kipling's own house Bateman's, by people magically plucked out of history by the elf Puck, or told by Puck himself. (Puck, who refers to himself as \\"the oldest Old Thing in England\\", is better known as a character in William Shakespeare's play A Midsummer Night's Dream.) The genres of particular stories range from authentic historical novella (A Centurion of the Thirtieth, On the Great Wall) to children's fantasy (Dymchurch Flit). Each story is bracketed by a poem which relates in some manner to the theme or subject of the story. Donald Mackenzie, who wrote the introduction for the Oxford World's Classics editionPuck of Pook's Hill – Introduction, Kipling.org of Puck of Pook's Hill in 1987, has described this book as an example of archaeological imagination that, in fragments, delivers a look at the history of England, climaxing with the signing of Magna Carta. Puck calmly concludes the series of stories: \\"Weland gave the Sword, The Sword gave the Treasure, and the Treasure gave the Law. It's as natural as an oak growing.\\" The stories originally appeared in the Strand Magazine in 1906 with illustrations by Claude Allin Shepperson, but the first book-form edition was illustrated by H. R. Millar. Arthur Rackham provided four colour plates for the first US edition. Puck of Pook's Hill was followed four years later by a second volume, Rewards and Fairies, featuring the same children in the following summer. T. S. Eliot included several of the poems in his 1941 collection A Choice of Kipling's Verse. Stories and poems=Puck's Song A poem which introduces themes from the following stories. 'Weland's Sword' A story of Burwash in the 11th century just before the Norman Conquest, told by Puck himself. A Tree Song A poem about English trees but emphasising the symbolic nature of Oak, Ash and Thorn. 'Young Men at the Manor' A story which continues the previous one just after the Norman Conquest. It is told by Sir Richard Dalyngridge, a Norman knight who took part in the Conquest and was awarded a Saxon manor. Sir Richard's Song The poem of Sir Richard Dalyngridge and how he became adapted to living in England despite his Norman origins. Harp Song of the Dane Women A lament by the Danish women for their menfolk who leave to go on a viking on the grey sea. 'The Knights of the Joyous Venture' Tells of a daring voyage to Africa made by Danes after capturing Sir Richard and his Saxon friend Hugh at sea. This story was adapted by Hal Foster as a Prince Valiant episode in 1942. Thorkild's Song A song by a Danish seafarer hoping for wind. 'Old Men at Pevensey' A continuation of the previous stories with a tale of intrigue set in Pevensey at the beginning of the reign of Henry I, 1100 AD. The Runes on Weland's Sword A poem which summarises the stories in the book to this point. A Centurion of the Thirtieth A poem which comments on how cities, thrones and powers are as transitory as flowers which bloom for a week. 'A Centurion of the Thirtieth' A story which introduces a new narrator, a Roman soldier named Parnesius, born and stationed in Britain in the 4th century. He tells how his military career started well because the general Magnus Maximus knew his father. A British-Roman Song The song of a Roman Briton serving Rome although he and his forebears have never seen the city. 'On the Great Wall' A story of the defence of Hadrian's Wall against the native Picts and Scandinavian raiders. A Song to Mithras A hymn to the god Mithras. 'The Winged Hats' A return to Hadrian's Wall and the fate of Magnus Maximus. A Pict Song The song of the Picts explaining how although they have always been defeated by the Romans, they will win in the end. Billy Bragg included a musical setting of the poem on his 1996 album William Bloke. Hal o' the Draft A poem about how prophets are never acknowledged or celebrated in their native village. 'Hal o' the Draft' A tale of deception involving the explorer Sebastian Cabot and the privateer Andrew Barton, probably set near the end of the 15th century and told by Sir Harry 'Hal' Dawe. A Smuggler's Song Sung by a smuggler advising people to look the other way when the contraband is run through the town. The Bee Boy's Song A poem which explains how honey bees must be told all the news or else they will cease to produce honey. 'Dymchurch Flit' A fairy tale told by Puck (in disguise) and set around the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries (about 1540 AD). A Three Part Song A poem which tells of the three main landscapes of Sussex, the Weald, Romney Marsh and the South Downs. The Fifth River How God assigned the four great rivers of the Garden of Eden to men, but Israel was later assigned the secret fifth great river, the River of Gold. 'The Treasure and the Law' A story told by a Jewish moneylender named Kadmiel, of money and intrigue leading up to the signing of Magna Carta in 1215. Here we learn the eventual fate of most of the African gold brought back to Pevensey by Sir Richard Dalyngridge. The Children's Song A patriotic prayer to God to teach the children how to live correctly so that their land will prosper. Original book illustrations H. R.

Psychoanalytic Quarterly, 53:386-409 McDougall felt that alexithymia had become too strongly classified as a neuroanatomical defectMcDougall, J.

(1989) Theaters of the Body: A Psychoanalytic Approach to Psychosomatic Illness, Norton. p.103 leaving little room for a purely psychoanalytic explanation for this phenomenon. In coining the term McDougall hoped to indicate the behavior of people who had experienced overwhelming emotion that threatened to attack their sense of integrity and identity. Such individuals, unable to repress the ideas linked to emotional pain and equally unable to project these feelings delusively onto representations of other people, simply ejected them from consciousness by \\"pulverizing all trace of feeling, so that an experience which has caused emotional flooding is not recognized as such and therefore cannot be contemplated\\".McDougall, J. (1989) Theaters of the Body: A Psychoanalytic Approach to Psychosomatic Illness, Norton. p.90 They were not suffering from an inability to experience or express emotion, but from \\"an inability to contain and reflect over an excess of affective experience.\\"McDougall, J. (1989) Theaters of the Body: A Psychoanalytic Approach to Psychosomatic Illness, Norton. p.94 'Disaffectation' conveys a deliberate double meaning. The Latin prefix dis-, indicates separation or loss and suggests, metaphorically, that certain people are psychologically separated from their emotions and may have \\"lost\\" the capacity to be in touch with interior psychic reality. Also included in this prefix is the secondary meaning from the Greek dys- with its implication of illness. According to Professor of Psychiatry of the University of Toronto, Graeme Taylor, this psychoanalytic conceptualization departs from older, less applicable theories which emphasized the role of unconscious neurotic conflicts, and instead facilitates a psychoanalytic model of physical illness and disease based on the operation of primitive pre-neurotic pathology that has failed to achieve psychic representation.Taylor, G.

To Krystal this consideration is important because \\"since these patients may develop serious, even occasionally fatal exacerbations of illness during psychotherapy, treating them with psychotherapy for psychosomatic illness is not indicated\\".Krystal, H.

This area is managed by the Finnmark Estate agency. The Finnmark Estate is managed by a board of directors with six members. Three of these are appointed by the Sami Parliament of Norway, and three by the Finnmark County Council. The leader of the board is elected by the Sami Parliament and the County Council in alternating years. Background The background for the Finnmark Act is the Sámi people's fight for their rights to manage their land and culture. In 1978 the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate published a plan that called for the construction of a dam and hydroelectric power plant that would create an artificial lake and inundate the Sami village of Máze. This plan was met by a strong opposition from the Sámi, and resulted in the Alta controversy. As a result of the controversy, the Norwegian government held meetings in 1980 and 1981 with a Sámi delegation appointed by the Norwegian Sámi Association, the Sámi Reindeer Herders’ Association of Norway and the Norwegian Sámi Council. The meetings resulted in the establishment of the Sámi Rights Committee addressing Sámi legal relations, that proposed among other things the establishing the Sami Parliament, and finally the adoption of the Finnmark Act in 2005. The Sámi rights to lands, waters and resources were strengthened after 1990, when Norway recognized the Sámi as an indigenous people by adapting the ILO convention 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries. The convention states that rights for the indigenous peoples to land and natural resources are recognized as central for their material and cultural survival. In addition, indigenous peoples should be entitled to exercise control over, and manage, their own institutions, ways of life and economic development in order to maintain and develop their identities, languages and religions, within the framework of the States in which they live. Purpose Traditionally the Norwegian authorities had a view that the nomadic Sámi use of land, water and natural resources did not establish any formal legal rights. The basis for the Finnmark act is that \\"the Sámis, through protracted traditional use of the land and water areas, have acquired individual and/or collective ownership and right to use lands and waters in Finnmark County.\\" The Finnmark act attempts to strengthen the Sámi rights, by giving the entire population of Finnmark greater influence of the property in the county. However, the act does not cover fishing rights in saltwater, mining, or oil rights. An important element of the act is discussion and recognition of existing rights of use and ownership of land. For this purpose a commission and tribunal have been set up. The foundation of this work is the principles of established custom and immemorial usage. (ibid.)

During Hardwick's three years as a starter for Harvard, Pennock developed a reputation as \\"one of the best linemen that ever played under the old or the new rules.\\" Harvard's football team did not lose a single game while Pennock played in its line, compiling records of 9–0 in 1912, 9–0 in 1913, and 7–0–2 in 1914. Harvard was the national football champion in each of Pennock's three seasons, out-scoring the competition, 588-61. In helping Harvard win three straight national championships, Pennock was also selected as a first-team All-American in all three years by Walter Camp. As a senior in 1914, Pennock was selected as a first-team All-American by 25 of 26 selectors, including Collier's Weekly (selected by Walter Camp), Vanity Fair (selected based on the votes of 175 newspapermen), Walter Eckersall of the Chicago Tribune, and the New York Herald. While attending Harvard, Pennock was also a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, the Institute of 1779, and the Hasty Pudding Club. Career in chemistry After graduating from Harvard, Pennock became a chemist. In the fall of 1915, he attended post-graduate courses at Harvard's chemical laboratories. He entered into a business partnership with two other Harvard graduates, James Bryant Conant and Chauncey Loomis, and formed the LPC Laboratories. Pennock and his partners opened a plant in a one-story building in the Queens section of New York, at which they manufactured chemicals that were selling at high prices due to interruption of imports from Germany during World War I. The New York plant was destroyed by a fire, and the partners immediately opened a new plant in an abandoned slaughterhouse in Newark, New Jersey. Death and tributes Two weeks after the Newark plant opened, Pennock and two others were killed in an explosion believed to have been caused by gasoline stored at the plant. His teammate Walter Trumbull spoke at the funeral and reflected on Pennock's life: > Stan was a true man. He lacked nothing in virtues and he was everything a > man should be. When in college we looked to 'Stan' as one to whom we might > tell our troubles. We confided everything to him and he was ever able to > make us see life in a different light. And Stan was possessed of great > abilities. The most striking feature of it all was, that he was unconscious > of what he really was. His Christian qualities will always remain in our > minds and we will think of him forever as the great friend he was. Following Pennock's death, the Boston Globe published a tribute which included the following observations: > \\"Stan\\" Pennock always will be remembered not only as one of Harvard's > greatest guards, but as one of the highest types of young manhood that ever > has been connected with Harvard football. His name will be remembered with > those of the late Marshall Newell and Francis Burr... Although active in > athletics at Harvard and in college days, Stanley Pennock was always a high > stand man of his classes. In 1917, Pennock's father endowed the Stanley Bagg Pennock Scholarship at Harvard, to be awarded to an indigent senior student specializing in chemistry and intending to pursue a career as a chemist. Pennock was posthumously elected to the College Football Hall of Fame as part of its second induction class in 1954.

He was selected retroactively by the Helms Athletic Foundation as the national college football player of the year for 1899, and was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1969. College career Poe attended Princeton University, and was named to Walter Camp's All-American football second team in 1898 and first team in 1899. He was one of the Poe Brothers, six celebrated American football players – second cousins, twice removed of American author Edgar Allan Poe – to play football at Princeton in the late 19th and early 20th century. Arthur made the plays that led to victories over Yale in 1898 and 1899. In 1898 he took the ball from a Yale runner's grasp and raced 100 yards for the game's only score. This feat, done while Poe had a bad knee, was known as \\"Poe's Run.\\" Remarkably, he almost repeated the feat in the game's second half when he ran 90 yards with a Yale fumble for an apparent touchdown before the ball was ruled down where it had been recovered.\\"Football, The American Intercollegiate Game\\" In 1899, Poe volunteered to attempt a game-winning field goal with only 30 seconds to play. Poe, despite never having before kicked in a game, volunteered to kick because both of Princeton's kickers had left the game due to injury. His kick was good and brought about an 11-10 Princeton victory over Yale.\\"The Poe Brothers\\" In 1914, a Pittsburgh Press article declared the last-minute winning field goal \\"Football's Greatest Moment.\\" \\"Pittsburgh Press\\" Both his winning run in 1898 and kick against the Elis in 1899 were celebrated in comic, quasi-epic poems by fellow Princeton grad M'Cready Sykes in a book entitled \\"Poe's Run and Other Poems.\\" Of Poe's long touchdown run to beat Yale 6-0 in 1898, Sykes penned: \\"Hys eyes on ye dystante Goale; He lookes behynde him not, but from ye Scripture learned in Youthe Rememberethe Mrs. Lot. \\"Ye Elis tears in fierce Pursuite; But Poe eludes ycm alle; He rushes 'twixt ye quyverrynge Postes, & sytteth on ye Balle.\\" \\"Poe's Run and Other Poems\\" Poe's stardom on the gridiron as a junior and senior at Princeton was the result of a remarkable comeback from a severe leg injury suffered during his freshman year, after which doctors doubted that he would ever play football again.\\"A Guide to Confident Living\\" At only 5-7 and 146 pounds, he was a standout on the defensive line, and in addition to his heroics in Yale games had an 80-yard touchdown run to beat Navy and a 40-yard run to help defeat Brown in his junior season. In addition to excelling at football, Arthur was the top wrestler during his time at Princeton and was voted the most popular man in his class.\\"For France\\" Dartmouth star Fred Crolius, who played with Poe on the Homestead Library & Athletic Club team after they had both left college, described Poe's grit as an undersized football star. \\"Arthur Poe was about as game a man as the football world ever saw\\" said Crolius. \\"He was handicapped in his playing by a knee which would easily slip out of place. We men who played with him on the Homestead team were often stopped after Arthur had made a magnificent tackle and had broken up heavy interference, with this quiet request: 'Pull my bum knee back into place.' After this was done, he would jump up and no one would ever know that it had been out. This man, who perhaps was the smallest man playing at that time, was absolutely unprotected. His suit consisted of a pair of shoes, stockings, unpadded pants, jersey and one elastic knee bandage.\\"\\"College Days\\" Professional career In 1900 and 1901, Poe played for the Homestead Library & Athletic Club as the team won the mythical professional football championship both years. In 1902, he joined many of his former Homestead players in the first National Football League as a member of the Pittsburgh Stars. The Stars would go on to win the league title that year. Later life After graduating from Princeton in 1900, Poe married Anne Emerson King in 1904.\\"Football Hero to Marry\\" They moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he would become the assistant plant manager and then the plant manager for the Quaker Oats Company. As a civic leader in Cedar Rapids, he served as director of the Red Cross; chairman of all Liberty Loan drives; president of the Princeton alumni class of 1900; president of the Cedar Rapids Chamber of Commerce; president of the Coe College Board of Trustees; vice president of St. Luke's Hospital; a member of the International Board of Directors of the Y.M.C.A.; trustee of the School of Religion at the University of Iowa; chairman of the Ways and Means Committee of the Diocese of Iowa and trustee of Iowa Episcopate Funds; and vice president of the Morris Plan Bank.

The regiment was originally mustered in on September 8, 1862, as the 138th New York Infantry Regiment, was quickly taken to Washington D.C. to be used in the defenses of the nation's capital. On December 19, 1862, it was redesignated as the 9th New York Heavy Artillery Regiment. On February 5, 1863, an additional Company M was created within the regiment with the transfer of the 22d N.Y. Volunteer Battery. Company L was organized in Albany between November 4 and December 9, 1863. Amongst the regimental commanders, William H.

Seward visited the regiment often, and as a consequence, it gained the nickname, \\"Seward's Pets.\\"Roe,\\"The Ninth New York heavy artillery\\", pg. 34 The Regiment was divided into three battalions. After the formation of the regiment, its duties were the protection of the capital. While there, it built and garrisoned Fort Mansfield, Fort Bayard, Fort Gaines, and Fort Foote until spring, 1864. A letter to the editor of the Dem. Press gives the condition of the regiment on March 11, 1864, about two months before the 9th began combat operations.

Y. Artillery, :Fort Mansfield, Md., March 11, '64. :TO THE EDITOR DEM. PRESS:—There has been a great deal said in Lyons and vicinity respecting the number of men in the Ninth Artillery--the number ranging, as stated by different reports, at all points from eighteen hundred up to three thousand. For the information of those who are not posted, I will state that the aggregate number in the Report which was this morning sent to Brigade Headquarters was 1,674; of this number 79 are recruits who have lately arrived, and are not yet assigned to companies. The number of men in each Company is as follows: Co. A, 127; B, 147; C, 99; D, 121; E, 91; F, 132; G, 102; H, 146; I, 148; K, 147; L, 147; M, 137. These numbers, of course, do not include commissioned officers. :Allow me, also, to disabuse the minds of your readers in regard to another point. This regiment has been styled the \\"pet Regiment,\\" Life Insurance Regiment, &c.; Probably there is not a Regiment in the Defences of Washington that has done more fatigue duty and real hard work than the Ninth. If it has not fought as many battles as some Regiments, the work which it has done has been as valuable to the Government. Besides building Forts Simmons, Mansfield, Bayard, Gaines and Foote, (one of the largest in the Defences,) it helped build Forts Reno and Sumner, two very large Forts, and has dug miles upon miles of rifle pits and built miles upon miles of Military roads and in addition chopped over more land then a good many of the farms in Wayne County put together would compose. Notwithstanding this vast amount of \\"drill\\" with the pick, shovel and axe, Col. Welling has brought the Regiment to as high a state of discipline as can be desired. If the boys have not worked, who has? :Yours, W. L. G. Combat OperationsOverland Campaign= In May 1864, Lt. General Ulysses S. Grant took command of the Union Army, embarking on an aggressive campaign, called the Overland Campaign, against the south. Due to heavy casualties suffered by Union Army, more troops were needed to embark on the campaign. To achieve this, General Grant ordered most of the troops defending the capital, including the 9th New York Heavy Artillery, to the front to increase troop numbers.Hattaway and Jones, pp. 527–28; Salmon, p. 252; Eicher, pp. 660–61. They would now be Heavy Artillery in name only, donning their rifles and assuming the duties of infantrymen. Two battalions, 1st and 2nd, of the 9th joined the VI Corps and the Army of the Potomac as infantry, while one, the 3rd battalion (Cos. C, I, L, and F), joined the Artillery Brigade. They numbered 1,944 men on May 26, 1864, as reported by Maj. Charles Burgess, before commencement of combat operations.The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Volume XXXVI, pg. 740 Battle of Cold Harbor The 9th New York Heavy Artillery joined the VI Corps on the banks of North Anna River on May 26, 1864, and then marched to the Pamunkey during the nights of May 27 and 28. From there, it departed for Cold Harbor on May 29, guarding the wagon train along the way, where it saw its first offensive action on June 1, 1864, at the Battle of Cold Harbor, where the brigade they were part of charged at 6 pm and captured several hundred prisoners, and also managed to hold against several counterattacks on June 2.The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Volume XXXVI, pg. 734 It also participated in the major attack on June 3, being placed second and third in the line of battle in Keifer's Brigade (110th Ohio and 122nd Ohio Infantry in the first line of battle, and 6th Maryland, 126th Ohio, and 138th Pennsylvania Infantry in the fourth line) in the 3rd Division, where they were ordered at 6 am to proceeded to advance 200 yards, where upon they entrenched under heavy fire.The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Volume XXXVI, pg. 734-35, 740 Over the course of the Battle of Cold Harbor the 9th numbered 43 killed and mortally wounded, 99 wounded, and 6 missing, for a total of 148.

It was built by prominent brewer Enoch Turner in 1856 on Sherbourne Street just north of Dundas St.. When it was built this was the fringe of the town, and the house is rural in appearance with a style common to rural Ontario in this period. The house was named after William Allan, who had owned the large Moss Park estate upon which the house was built. In the years after the house was built the Sherbourne/Jarvis area became home to the city's elite, and Allandale was dwarfed by several mansions in the area. The area changed again dramatically in the 20th century, becoming one of the poorest in Toronto; home to a working class and transient population with the old houses left in poor condition. One of Allandale's last occupants was I.F. Hellmuth, who founded the Toronto Lawn Tennis Club in 1874, and in 1881 won the first Rogers Cup. He died there in 1944. In the 1960s Allandale was slated for demolition, as it and its neighbours were to be replaced with a public housing project, similar to the nearby Moss Park. Public protests halted the demolition in 1973. Instead a new form of public housing was tried by architects Jack Diamond and Barton Myers. The Sherbourne Lanes project integrated Allandale with several neighbouring Victorian structures and modern infills to preserve the character of the neighbourhood while a creating modern public housing complex.

(1786–1834) was a Roman Catholic Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin in Ireland, who used the signature \\"JKL\\", an acronym from \\"James Kildare and Leighlin.\\" Doyle was active in the Anti-Tithe movement. A campaigner for Catholic Emancipation up to 1829, he was also an educator, church organiser and the builder of Carlow cathedral. Early life Doyle was born close to New Ross, County Wexford in 1786, the posthumous son of a respectable farmer; his mother (Anne Warren, of Quaker extraction) was living in poverty at the time of his birth. At the age of eleven he witnessed all the horrors of the Battle of New Ross between the United Irishmen and British Crown forces supplemented by the militia and yeomanry. He received his early education at Clonleigh, at Rathconrogue at the school of a Mr. Grace, and later at the Augustinian College, New Ross under the care of an Augustinian monk, Rev. John Crane.Webb, Alfred. \\"Doyle James Warren\\", A Compendium of Irish Biography, Dublin. M.H. Gill & Son, 1878 Doyle joined the Augustinian friars in 1805 at Grantstown, County Wexford and then studied for his doctorate at Coimbra in Portugal (1806–08). His studies were disturbed by the Peninsular War, during which he served as a sentry in Coimbra. Later, he accompanied the British Army with Wellington's forces to Lisbon as an interpreter. Following Doyle's return to Ireland, he was ordained to the priesthood on 1 October 1809, at Enniscorthy. He taught logic at the Augustinian College, New Ross. In 1813, Doyle was appointed to a professorship at Carlow College, holding the Chair of Rhetoric and in 1814, the Professorship of Theology. Bishop 1819–1834 Michael Corcoran, Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin, died on 22 February 1819. Doyle was a popular choice of the clergy and bishops of the Archdiocese of Dublin and was chosen by the Holy See as Corcoran's successor. He was formally named in August 1819 and was duly consecrated in Carlow Parish Church on 14 November. During his fifteen-year tenure as Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin, Doyle earned respect nationwide for his polemics in furtherance of the Catholic position in both Irish and British society, and in supporting the work of the Catholic Association. His books on pastoral, political, educational and inter-denominational matters provide a rich source of material for social and religious historians (see below). He was a close ally of Daniel O'Connell in the political campaign for Catholic Emancipation which was finally passed in 1829 by the Wellington government. Tithe War In 1830, the new tithe-proctor of Graigue (a parish of 4,779 Catholics and 63 Protestants) decided to break with the tradition of his predecessor and to enforce seizure orders for the collection of arrears of Tithes. Tithes provided financial support of the established Anglican Church of Ireland. Some of the recalcitrant Catholics had habitually transferred ownership of their livestock to Doyle in order to avoid seizure at the town fair. The new proctor requested their priest's cooperation in handing over the assets. Doyle refused, and the proctor, aided by the Irish Constabulary, seized some of the livestock. A mass riot broke out at the fair and there were several casualties. A civil disobedience campaign followed, peppered with sporadic violence mostly at country fairs over the seizure of livestock. A period of instability that would become known as the Tithe War followed. Doyle was a leader of nonviolent resistance to the Tithe, devoting himself both to strengthening the nonviolent resistance and to discouraging like paramilitary secret societies who had taken to using violence to drive out tithe-collectors and to intimidate collaborators.Fitz-Patrick, William John The Life, Times, and Correspondence of the Right Rev. Dr. Doyle, Bishop of Kildale and Leighlin (1880) He said: \\"I maintain the right which [Irish Catholics] have of withholding, in a manner consistent with the law and their duty as subjects, the payment of tithe in kind or in money until it is extorted from them by the operation of the law.\\" The ministers of the Church of Ireland, Doyle concluded, are On another occasion he said: Doyle was invited to give evidence on the state of Ireland to parliamentary enquiries in London in 1825, 1830 and 1832. Asked at one such inquiry to explain his urging his countrymen to resist the tithes, and why he should not feel himself responsible for the violence that accompanied the Tithe War, he replied: > [N]o man ought to be condemned for exhorting people to pursue justice in a > certain line, though he may foresee that in the pursuit of that justice the > opposition given to those who are proceeding in a just course may produce > collision, and that collision lead to the commission of crime; but our duty, > as I conceive, is to seek for the injustice, and there to impute the crime… > It is to that injustice, and not to those who pursue a just course for the > attainment of a right end, that the guilt is to be ascribed. Seeing his readiness and resource, the Duke of Wellington remarked that Doyle examined the committee rather than was examined by them. Other works Given Doyle's prior experience in education, his major contribution was arguably in helping the establishment of National Schools across Ireland from 1831, the initiative of Edward Stanley, Chief Secretary of Ireland, which were initially started with a U.K. government grant of £30,000. The proposed system was ahead of state provision for education in England or Scotland at that time. This Model School prototype was, in some respects, experimental. His involvement is a sign of his practicality and foresight. He told his priests: Doyle spoke before a Parliamentary Committee as follows: Doyle made statements on other issues: the theological status of 'non-Catholic' Christians; freedom to convert to Protestantism, mixed marriages and, as already mentioned, on the union of Catholics and Anglicans. We know now that on this last issue he was asked to resign by Rome and was eventually allowed to continue after agreeing not to speak on the issue again. Carlow-cathedral The construction of Carlow Cathedral of the Assumption crowned Doyle's career, being started in 1828 and finished at the end of November 1833. Doyle fell ill for a number of months before dying on 15 June 1834. He was buried in his new cathedral. A sculpture, by John Hogan, in memorial to Doyle was finished in 1839. Several biographies were written on Doyle before 1900 and his influence on the later Irish Catholic bishops in the period 1834-1900 was considerable. He had proved that negotiations with government could be beneficial to his church, his congregation, and its finances.

Boris Lissanevitch, Ukrainian: Борис Миколайович Лисаневич, , (October 4, 1905 in Odesa, Russian Empire - October 20, 1985 in Kathmandu, Nepal) was a ballet dancer, and a hotelier and restaurateur. He helped pave the way for tourism in Nepal, when he opened the country's first hotel, the Hotel Royal, and later when he created the Yak & Yeti Hotel and Restaurant.  Early life and ballet career  Lisanevich was the youngest of three brothers. His great-grandfather Grigory Ivanovich Lisanevich fought at Borodino and his portrait was placed in the Military Gallery of the Winter Palace. At age 9, Boris entered the Odessa Cadet Academy. In 1924 he moved to France. In Monte-Carlo he married a ballet dancer named Kira Shcherbacheva, who died in 2016. This would eventually lead to him dancing with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes until 1929. Then Boris left for South America and continued dancing, including in London, Milan. However his work visa expired in the UK and he only had a League of Nations Refugee Passport. In the 1930s he got work in Bombay and traveled in Ceylon, Indochina, Malaya, Shanghai and then went back to India and stayed in Calcutta, where, with the help of his friends, he founded \\"Club 300\\". Lisanevich was the person who introduced the dish Chicken a la Kiev, to Calcutta as a menu item at \\"Club 300\\". The club was opened in 1936 and he ran it until 1946 and then left for New York City; subsequently he came back to India. Lisanevich made friends with Prince Emmanuel Golitsyn and in 1944 met and became friends with the Nepalese king Tribhuvan, who was in Calcutta for medical treatment. Lisanevich launched secret meetings of Tribhuvan with Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and participated in restoring Tribhuvan to power. Lisanevich married a Danish woman, Inger Pheiffer (died in 2013), whom he had met in Bombay. He had three sons with Inger: Mischa, Alexander and Nicholas, and one daughter Xenia from his previous marriage to Kira. In 1951 the king deposed the Rana family from power and invited Boris to Nepal as a tourist. Then he got a job in Nepal where he managed tourism and served as a consultant to the government. The local Soviet embassy asked Lisanevich to organize a meeting for Valentina Tereshkova there.  Nepal  At the time, Visas were difficult to obtain in Nepal. In an attempt to reform this process, Lisanevich convinced a group of 20 tourists from Kolkata (then Calcutta), mostly women, to come to Nepal in 1955 and then proceeded to have an intense discussion with the newly crowned King Mahendra about granting them a 15-day visa. Finally the king relented, the guests arrived and Boris held the country’s first handicraft exhibition. In 1951 Lisanevich opened the country's first hotel, The Hotel Royal with the Yak and Yeti Bar, in a converted Rana Palace with Prince Basundhara as his business partner. Once the Royal Hotel closed in 1969, he opened the Yak and Yeti restaurant in Lal Durbar with another business partner, who went on to found and establish the Hotel Yak and Yeti. Boris ran the restaurant as \\"The Chimney Room\\" in the newly established hotel bearing the name that Boris invented. Lisanevich was buried in the cemetery of the British embassy in Kathmandu.

In the early 1990s rock engravings were discovered in Vila Nova de Foz Côa during the construction of a dam in the Côa River valley. They include thousands of engraved rock drawings of horses, bovines and other animals, human and abstract figures, dated from 22,000 to 10,000 years B.C.

In 1995 elections led to a change in government resulting in the cancellation of the dam project. Since 1995, a team of archaeologists have been studying and cataloging this prehistoric complex. The Archaeological Park of the Côa Valley () was created to receive visitors and research the findings, and the Côa Museum was constructed here following a major design competition. History Carvings of various zoomorphic creatures, including in particular, a horse Paleolithic rock engravings breaking the natural rock formation Various zoomorphic and anthropomorphic designs on granite slabs The earliest drawings appearing in the Côa Valley date between 22–20 thousand years B.C., consisting of zoomorphic imagery of nature.António Martinho Baptista and Mário Varela Gomes (1995), p. 350–384 Between 20–18 thousand B.C. (Solutense period), a secondary group of animal drawings included examples of muzzled horses. There was greater elaboration during 16–10 thousand years B.C. (Magdalenense period), with a Paleolithic style. The essentially anthropomorphic and zoomorphic designs included horses identifiable by their characteristic manes, aurochs with mouths and nostrils detailed, and deer. Other paintings dating back to the Epipaleolithic period were of zoomorphic semi-naturalist design. Some anthropomorphic and zoomorphic designs, both geometric and abstract, date from the Neolithic period. Others, primarily anthropomorphic, date back to the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age. Between the 5th and 1st centuries BC, early organized societies produced anthropomorphic and zoomorphic carvaings that include weapons and symbols. The most recent era of recorded rock art dates from the 17th to 20th centuries and includes religious, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic designs, inscriptions and dates. The most recent of these include representations of boats, trains, bridges, planes and representations of various scenes, including drawings completed by António Seixas and Alcino Tomé.Baptista (1999)CNART (1999) 20th century In the 20th century, the construction of the Pocinho Dam and its associated reservoir likely resulted in the immersion of many rock cliff drawings.António Martinho Baptista (2002), p.62 By the 1990s, prospectors revealed a group of important Paleolithic, Neolithic and Chalcolithic carvings in the lower part of the Côa Valley, likely in November 1991 by Nelson Rabanda (articles were not published on this work until November 1994).Nelson Rebanda (1995)António Faustino de Carvalho (1995) Later, António Martinho Baptista would determine that Iron Age carvings corresponded to works by Celtic-Iberian tribes, specifically the Medobrigenais or Zoilos. Some of these cultures were identified for the first time with the Côa findings. In 1995, a plan to construct a dam was approved and works began in the Côa Valley. However, following the original discovery of rock art, an archaeologist had been investigating the Côa valley under the direction of the national energy company (Energias de Portugal – EDP) and the agency responsible for architectural heritage (Instituto Português do Património Arquitectónico – IPPAR). Both were made aware of the prehistoric art along the Côa, earlier than the general public and scientific community. Archaeologist Nélson Rabanda, studying the site under an agreement between EDP and IPPAR, reported the case to the press and other organizations interested in prehistoric art and heritage, such as UNESCO. There was a move by EDP to disprove the age of the carvings in order to continue the dam project, despite the damage it would do to the findings. National controversy around the case forced IPPAR to petition UNESCO for a review of the site. In December 1994, Jean Clottes came to the region to investigate the discoveries. The UNESCO reports were not unanimous on whether the power plant should be cancelled; Clottes, the head of prehistoric department, noted that rising water may protect the engravings from vandalism, but also confirmed that Coa Valley \\"is the biggest open air site of palaeolithic art in Europe, if not in the world\\". At the time, the number of known carvings was smaller but there was suspicion that many more had already been submerged by the completed Pocinho Dam. This was confirmed by Nelson Rabanda, who investigated the submerged Canada do Inferno site and found more carvings. Archaeologists discovered other sites in the areas of Penascosa, Ribeira de Riscos, Quinta da Barca, Vermelhosa, Vale de José Esteves, among others, and quickly published their discoveries and took the matter to national media. A citizens group, Movimento para a Salvação das Gravuras do Côa, arose with a slogan, \\"As gravuras não sabem nadar\\" (The carvings don't know how to swim), an allusion to a major hit song of the time, Black Company's \\"Nadar\\".António Martinho Baptista (2002), p. 62–63 A second UNESCO team, led by Mounir Bouchenaki, director of the World Heritage branch, was sent to conclude the case. His team determined that a great part of the carvings dated as far back as the Palaeolithic.António Martinho Baptista (2002), p.63 The Portuguese government's insistence in proceeding with the dam project led to mounting political scandal and pressure from the international community. The dam project was denounced in international newspapers such as The Sunday Times, The New York Times, the International Herald Tribune, and broadcasters such as the BBC. Meanwhile, after the visit by the UNESCO delegation, IPPAR created an international scientific commission to accompany the study of the art in the Côa valley. This was considered controversial. It included António Beltrán, E. Anati and Jean Clottes, and met in May 1994. EDP continued to promote other methods of \\"saving\\" the prehistoric art (such as creating moulds or carving the panels from the cliff faces), while still promoting the continuation of the dam project. EDP was also helped by the direct dating controversy; Robert Bednarik and Alan Watchman, in addition to Fred Phillips and Ronald Dorn, used an unproven methodology to affirm that the carvings were not Palaeolithic. These events displeased archaeologists and the public. A broad-based movement against the dam developed. In 1995, general elections resulted in a government change. Incoming Prime Minister António Guterres cancelled the dam project in November 1995. The government established a system to monitor and preserve the archeological resources; the events of the so-called \\"Battle of Côa\\" led to the establishment in May 1997 of the National Centre for Prehistoric Art () and the Archaeological Park of the Côa Valley (), the Portuguese Institute of Archaeology (, as well as dependent agencies. The National Centre for Aquatic and Subaquatic Archaeology () opened in August 1996. The Prehistoric Rock-Art Sites in the Côa Valley were designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1998 (from an advisory board report on 25 June 1997). 21st century In 2003, a study analysed the viability of introducing the Przewalski horse in the area, a species related to those portrayed in the Paleolithic rock art.Fatima Monteiro (11 January 2006) By May 2004, a public tender was commissioned by the Portuguese Order of Architects to design the Côa Museum, won by architects Tiago Pimentel and Camilo Rebelo. On 26 January 2007, construction of the Côa Museum begun. More excavations were done in Fariseu from 19 September to October 2005, under the direction of Thierry Aubry, who discovered several slabs of schist (10 x 20 centimetres) dating to the Paleolithic. The conference HERITAGE 2008 – World Heritage and Sustainable Development International Conference took place at Vila Nova de Foz Côa between 7–9 May 2008. The conference examined the relationships between heritage, human development, natural environment and building preservation, and promoted significant discussion, organized by the Portuguese Ministry of Culture. In August 2010, the World Heritage Committee extended the UNESCO world heritage extension to neighbouring site of Siega Verde in Spain. The Siega Verde site, with comparable carvings/etchings in 94 panels along a 15 kilometre stretch across the border includes over 500 representations. Its dating to a similar period allowed its inclusion in the world heritage designation along with the Côa Valley sites. In March 2018, the Côa Valley Sites and Museum were added to the Cultural Routes of the Council of Europehttp://www.prehistour.eu/carp-guide/?pais=5&provincia;=18, along other major prehistoric sites like Lascaux (France), Altamira (Spain) and Valcamonica (Italy).https://www.dn.pt/lusa/interior/arte-do-coa-incorporada- em-itinerario-cultural-do-conselho-da-europa-9201841.html Geography The prehistoric site can be accessed from EN102 road (Vila Nova de Foz Côa- Celorico da Beira), via Muxagata, or alternately via the EN222 road (Vila Nova de Foz Côa-Figueira de Castelo Rodrigo) via Castelo Melhor. It reaches parts of the municipalities of Figueira de Castelo Rodrigo, Mêda, Pinhel and Vila Nova de Foz Côa. The lower portion of Côa River Valley runs south to north, at about 130 metres above sea level, spread over an area of . The watercourse is flanked by rolling/undulating hills, surrounded by rare species of river brush, vineyards, olive and almond trees, with the higher areas occupied by pasture and fields. At about the 17 kilometre mark, the relief is rocky with granite and schist outcroppings. The Côa Valley archaeological park comprises 23 sites with engravings or paintings, along the final 17 kilometres of the River Côa, with ten sites on the left bank and eight on the right bank. In addition, five sites are located along other tributaries of the Douro River, spread in three different nuclei: Faia, Quinta da Barca and Penacosa, along the mouth of the Ribeira de Piscos, in an area of 20,000 hectares. Of the 23 prehistoric Rock-Art sites, 14 are classified: * Broeira (Vila Nova de Foz Côa) * Canada do Inferno/Rego da Vide (Foz Côa) * Faia (Pinhel) * Faia/Vale Afonsinho (Figueira de Castelo Rodrigo) * Fonte Frieira (Foz Côa) * Meijapão (Foz Côa) * Penascosa (Foz Côa) * Quinta da Barca (Foz Côa) * Quinta do Fariseu (Foz Côa) * Ribeirinha (Foz Côa) * Ribeira de Piscos/Quinta dos Poios (Foz Côa) * Vale da Figueira/Teixugo (Foz Côa) * Vale de Moinhos (Foz Côa) * Vale dos Namorados (Foz Côa) Nine sites are in ongoing classification process: * Alto da Bulha * Canada da Moreira * Moinhos de Cima * Vale de Cabrões * Vale da Casa * Vale de Forno * Vale de José Esteves * Vale de Videiro * Vermelhosa Art The prehistoric art is either carved, incised or picked, combining various techniques, but rarely painted, utilizing the vertical schist slabs as canvass. These schist rocks, along the northern part of the Côa River, are large drawings in contrast with smaller depictions in areas. Their size varies between and , but most are 40–50 centimetres in extension, often forming panels and compositions. The style often features bold lines, but many are touched with fine, thin lines. Prehistoric Rock-Art Site of the Côa Valley – Penascosa – BullThe art in the Faia site occupies several vertical panels of granite. Two groups of authors were identified in this region, including 230 carvings from the Epipaleolithic and Bronze Ages. The more archaic period of Côa corresponds to 137 rocks with 1000 carvings and rare paintings, by artists who concentrated on zoomorphic representations: equine (horses), bovine (aurochs), caprines and deer (the latter primarily associated with the final phase of the Magdalense period). There are also representations of fish, intermediary animals, along with a small group of geometric or abstract shapes (including lines and symbols in Penascosa and Canada do Inferno). In one of the rarer depictions, there is a solitary anthropomorphic figure with a phallus, dating to the Magdalenense period in the Ribeira de Piscos site. The artists' motives are unclear, and the image appears isolated and over-drawn by other figures. At the Faia site, there are unique painted carvings, with ocre paint highlighting the nostrils and mouth of a figure. Other groups of carvings in Vale Carbões and Faia, dating from the Epipaleolithic and Neolithic, include zoomorphic designs, also painted with ocre. There are also Iron Age sites along the mouth of the Côa in the valleys of smaller Douro river tributaries. They include anthropomorphic figures and horses, in addition to some dogs, deer and birds, accompanied by weapons (swords, lances and shields). These armed warriors could represent scenes from battles or hunting parties. Generally, these images are stratified, with new designs drawn over the pre-existing carvings. The last period of art dates from the modern era, and includes religious motifs, both anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures, in addition to inscriptions, dates, boats, trains, bridges, planes and landscapes. The importance of this prehistoric art site is due to its rareness and extension. Although there are numerous prehistoric art sites in caves, open-air sites are rarer (including Mazouco (Portugal), Campôme (France) and Siega Verde (Spain), and few spread over 17 kilometres. Archaeologists acknowledge sites like this as open-air sanctuaries of prehistoric humankind, with particular relevance to West European Hunter- Gatherer (WHG) history.

The mountain range consists of three peaks: Gumihorn (), Tuba (), and the closest summit next to the viewpoint, Geiss (). The viewpoint lies at an altitude of about , at the western end of a prominent ridge of the Schwarzhorn group, which separates the valley of the Schwarze Lütschine from Lake Brienz. It is notable for its hotel and, since 1893, its mountain railway, one of the highest in Switzerland. In good weather conditions there are views to many surrounding mountains, including the Eiger, Mönch, Jungfrau, and others giants of the Bernese Alps. Also, the town of Interlaken and the two great lakes of Thun and Brienz are visible to the north, lower. The area is accessible via the Schynige Platte railway, which runs from Wilderswil, where connection is made with Bernese Oberland railway trains from Interlaken. The railway reaches a height of at the terminus station, on the south-facing slopes of Geiss summit. Southwest of the station is a hotel and mountain restaurant, at a height of . Northeast of the station is the Schynige Platte alpine botanical garden, specialising in the display of, and research into, the high altitude flora of Switzerland. A number of short loop trails extend north from the train station, reaching several view points, all within one kilometre from each other. Directly above the station and hotel, and overlooking the valleys of Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald, is the Geiss summit (). Further north, and overlooking Interlaken and the two great lakes, are the Tuba () and Oberberghorn () summits. The highest summit in the Schynige Platte area, between the Daube and Geiss summits, the tower-like Gumihorn peak (), cannot be reached by pedestrians. The Schynige Platte is also the starting point for the popular hiking trails to Loucherhorn, Faulhorn or First which is connected to Grindelwald by a gondola lift. Administratively, the area is shared between the municipalities of Gündlischwand and Gsteigwiler, the tripoint between the municipalities of Bönigen, Gündlischwand and Gsteigwiler being on the Tuba summit.

UNAMI's mandate includes advising and assisting the government on political dialogue and national reconciliation; supporting political processes such as elections and the national census; facilitating regional dialogue between Iraq and neighboring countries; coordinating the delivery of humanitarian aid; advancing judicial and legal reforms; and promoting human rights. The Mission's achievements include the drafting of Iraq’s 2005 Constitution, assisting in six national elections, coordinating humanitarian and financial assistance from the U.N. and donors, and providing advisory support to the Iraq's parliament, the Council of Representatives. Since 2017, UNAMI has also worked to investigate and bring to justices members of ISIS for their crimes in the country. Since its establishment, UNAMI's mandate is subject to annual renewal and review by the UNSC; as of 2019, Resolution 2470 extended its mandate until 31 May 2020. History The United Nations has been operating in Iraq since 1955 through a variety of programmes; specialized agencies established their offices in the early 1990s, with UNAMI being established after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Amid deteriorating conditions in 2007, the UN worked to progressively increase its presence in Iraq and continued to expand its operations throughout the country. The UN maintains its presence in Iraq through the Assistance Mission and the United Nations Country Team (UNCT), which regroups the 20 UN agencies currently operating in Iraq. Former Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General Sérgio Vieira de Mello was among 22 killed in a 2003 suicide attack carried out against the United Nations. The death of the envoy who was seen as a likely candidate for Secretary-General left a lasting impact on the United Nations.

He previously hosted his own radio show at a San Antonio station and was poised to own a radio station, but the FCC soon ruled that radio stations could not sublet time to outside purchasers. Prior to that, Morales applied for an application in 1942, however, due to World War II, it was delayed until 1946 and the permit was not granted until four years later. Within Houston and the Texas Gulf Coast, it was the first Spanish language radio station that provided educational programs, music, and news. KLVL sponsored fundraising and job seeking programs. KLVL then officially went on the air on May 5, 1950, to celebrate both Cinco de Mayo and his wife, Angeline Vera Morales' birthday. During the first few years of broadcasting, it was a daytimer station, but the permit was eventually extended to authorize a 24/7 broadcasting operation. In 1954, after flooding devastated the Rio Grande Valley, the station started a campaign to obtain clothing and necessity goods for the flood victims.

It is native to Angola, Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo and Uganda. In former times, its seeds were widely sold as an inexpensive nutmeg substitute. This is now less common outside its region of production. Other names of calabash nutmeg include Jamaican nutmeg, African nutmeg, ehuru, ariwo, awerewa, ehiri, airama, African orchid nutmeg, muscadier de Calabash and lubushi.  Cultivation and history  The calabash nutmeg tree grows naturally in evergreen forests from Liberia to Nigeria and Cameroon, Ghana, Angola and also Uganda and west Kenya. Due to the slave trade in the 18th century, the tree was introduced to the Caribbean islands where it was established and become known as Jamaican nutmeg. In 1897, Monodora myristica was introduced to Bogor Botanical Gardens, Indonesia, where the trees flower on a regular basis but no fruit could yet be collected. Due to its large and orchid-like flowers, the tree is also grown as an ornamental.  Botany = Tree and leaves  The Monodora myristica tree can reach a height of 35 m and 2 m in diameter at breast height (DBH). It has a clear trunk and branches horizontally. The leaves are alternately arranged and drooping with the leaf blade being elliptical, oblong or broadest towards the apex and tapering to the stalk. They are petiolate and can reach a size of up to 45 x 20 cm.  Flower  The flower appears at the base of new shoots and is singular, pendant, large and fragrant. The pedicel bears a leaf-like bract and can reach 20 cm in length. The flower’s sepals are red-spotted, crisped and 2.5 cm long. The corolla is formed of six petals of which the three outer reach a length of 10 cm and show curled margins and red, green and yellow spots. The three inner petals are almost triangular and form a white-yellowish cone which on the outside is red-spotted and green on the inside. The flower’s stigmas become receptive before its stamens mature and shed their pollen (protogynous). Its pollen is shed as permanent tetrads. . The flower is pollinated by insects.  Fruit and seeds  The fruit is a berry of 20 cm diameter and is smooth, green and spherical and becomes woody. It is attached to a long stalk which is up to 60 cm long. Inside the fruit the numerous oblongoid, pale brown, 1.5 cm long seeds are surrounded by a whitish fragrant pulp. The seeds contain 5-9% of a colourless essential oil.  Uses = Fruit and seeds  The odour and taste of the Monodora myristica seed is similar to nutmeg and it is used as a popular spice in the West African cuisine. The fruits are collected from wild trees and the seeds are dried and sold whole or ground to be used in stews, soups, cakes and desserts. For medicinal purposes they are used as stimulants, stomachic, for headaches, sores and also as insect repellent. The seeds are also made into necklaces.  Timber and bark  Monodora myristica timber is hard but easy to work with and is used for carpentry, house fittings and joinery. In medicine, the bark is used in treatments of stomach-aches, febrile pains, eye diseases and haemorrhoids.  Chemical compounds  The essential oil that can be obtained from the leaves contains β-caryophyllene, α-humulene and α-pinene. The major compounds found in the essential oil from the seeds are α-phellandrene, α-pinene, myrcene, limonene and pinene.

The sixth named storm, second hurricane, first and only major hurricane of the inactive 2007 Pacific hurricane season, Flossie originated from a tropical wave that emerged off Africa on July 21\\\\. After traversing the tropical Atlantic, the wave crossed Central America and entered the eastern Pacific on August 1\\\\. There, a favorable environment allowed it to become a tropical depression and a tropical storm shortly thereafter on August 8\\\\. Tracking generally west- southwestward, the storm entered a stage of rapid deepening on August 10, despite forecasts of an only marginally favorable environment. On August 11, Flossie became a major hurricane, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 140 mph (220 km/h). With cooler sea surface temperatures and high wind shear in its path, the hurricane weakened steadily, deteriorating to a tropical depression by August 16\\\\. The storm's center became devoid of strong thunderstorms later that day, indicating Flossie no longer qualified as a tropical cyclone. As a strong storm, Flossie prompted hurricane and tropical storm warnings for the Big Island of Hawaii. Residents were warned by emergency officials to prepare for over a foot of rainfall and wind gusts well within tropical storm force. However, impact was negligible; the peak wind gust on the Big Island of Hawaii reached , and rainfall totals remained below . Meteorological history The formation of Hurricane Flossie is attributed to a poorly defined tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa and into the eastern Atlantic Ocean on July 21\\\\. Tracking westward, the disturbance remained disorganized and lacked a significant amount of convection – shower and thunderstorm activity – near its center. The wave crossed Central America and entered the eastern Pacific on August 1, where it was met with a much more favorable atmospheric environment for organization and intensification. A consolidated area of shower and thunderstorms developed near the center while the system was situated just south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on August 2, though no further development occurred thereafter. Two days later, an increase in deep convection was observed on conventional satellite imagery, but like the first, no further organization occurred. On August 6, yet another burst of convection developed near the low-level center, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) contemplated classifying the disturbance at that time, but yet another wane in shower and thunderstorm activity deferred this. The disturbance tracked westward through August 8, and following another deep burst of convection that persisted itself for an appreciable amount of time, had finally gathered enough organization to be classified as a tropical depression at 1800 UTC on August 8\\\\. At this time, the depression was situated roughly east-southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii. Within an environment characterized by low vertical wind shear as a result of an anticyclone aloft and warm sea surface temperatures, Tropical Depression Six-E continued its organizational trend, and was declared a tropical storm – earning the name Flossie – six hours after formation. Hurricane Flossie approaching Hawaii on August 13 Located on the southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge situated over southwestern Mexico, Flossie tracked generally west-southwestward after formation while intensifying. Upper-level outflow began to expand in all quadrants of the cyclone and spiral bands became prominent around the center on August 9. An eyewall and associated mid-level eye-feature was observed on microwave imagery, but was obscured on conventional satellite imagery, that evening. Following a series of satellite intensity estimates and the presence of an eye on visible and infrared satellite imagery, Flossie was upgraded to a Category 1 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale at 1200 UTC on August 10. Despite forecasts of an increasingly unfavorable environment as the cyclone moved towards the Hawaiian Islands, Flossie continued to intensify. The hurricane unexpectedly began a period of rapid deepening during the overnight hours of August 10, and by 0600 UTC on August 11, Flossie attained major hurricane intensity – a Category 3 hurricane – with a quickly falling barometric pressure. Early morning satellite images revealed a eye with cloud tops cooler than surrounding the feature. Further intensification ensued as the storm entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC)'s area of responsibility that morning, and Flossie was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane by 1200 UTC. Two hours later, the cyclone attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 949 mb (hPa; 28.02 inHg), the strongest tropical cyclone of the 2007 Pacific hurricane season. After peak intensity, Flossie was forecast to gradually weaken as wind shear increased. However, despite prediction of such, Flossie did not weaken at all and in fact remained a Category 4 hurricane for 36 continuous hours. In its discussion during the morning hours of August 13, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center stated that Flossie \\"was not willing to give up.\\" By the pre-dawn hours of August 14, however, the cyclone began to feel the impacts of increasingly cool sea surface temperatures and higher southerly wind shear. While outflow in the northern semicircle of Flossie remained exceptional, outflow in the southern half of the circulation began to dissipate; additionally, the southern flank of the eyewall began to fall apart. An aircraft reconnaissance flight into the system revealed surface winds of and warming cloud tops, and Flossie was downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane. Further passes through the eyewall of the storm depicted ever- decreasing surface winds and organization with Flossie, and the storm was downgraded once again, to a Category 2 hurricane, by 1200 UTC as it passed south of the Hawaiian Islands. Over of vertical wind shear eroded the remainder of the storm's eyewall on August 15; as such, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center downgraded the cyclone to a tropical storm. Further weakening to tropical depression status occurred by 0600 UTC on August 16 as shower and thunderstorm activity over the center faded away. By 1200 UTC, a lone low- level swirl remained on satellite imagery, and the storm dissipated thereafter, while located southwest of the Hawaiian Islands. Preparations and impact Overcast skies from Flossie along the Kona Coast Shortly after entering the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, the organization issued a hurricane watch for the Big Island of Hawaii. Within a few days, as the hurricane tracked slightly further to the north and its wind radii expanded, a tropical storm warning was overlaid on the hurricane watch. Heavy rainfall and flooding were expected to be the primary concern; as such, flash flood watches were issued and officials warned residents of the potential for of rainfall. Governor Linda Lingle declared a state of emergency for the Island of Hawaii in advance of the storm, where residents were advised to stock up on necessary supplies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dispatched 20 transportation, public works and health experts to the region. Emergency shelters were opened, though were used little. The threat of the storm led to the closure of schools, including the University of Hawaii at Hilo and Hawaii Community College, forcing an estimated 26,000 college students to remain home. Some libraries, parks, private schools, banks and other businesses were also closed. Non-essential state employees were advised to remain at home, and emergency workers were mobilized to quickly assist in the aftermath of the storm. In advance of the storm, many tourists canceled reservations. Forecast heavy rains over the southeast-facing slopes of the Big Island failed to occur, as Flossie turned westward before low-level southeasterly winds had a chance to produce mountain-enhanced rainfall. However, north and northeast-facing slopes received minimal rainfall; of rain was reported in the Hamakua, South Hilo, and Puna Districts. Elsewhere, of precipitation fell at Maui, and fell at the Koolau Range on Oahu, although no significant winds or flooding was reported. Wave action affected the southeast-facing shores, also with little impact. The most significant waves were estimated at in height, while sustained winds of at least were reported at South Point. A large lava bench collapsed into the ocean on August 13, which may have been related to the hurricane's passage, or alternatively, a recent 5.4 magnitude earthquake.

A. hispida's small size, especially when compared to its Angophora and Eucalyptus relatives, leads to it being known by the common name dwarf apple. It is native to a relatively small patch of central New South Wales – from just south of Sydney up to the Gosford area. The plant's leaves are sessile (stalk-less) and hug the stem with heart-shaped bases. Its previous name – A. cordifolia – referred to these cordate leaves. Another distinctive feature are the red bristly hairs that cover the branchlets, flower bases and new growth. This leads to the specific epithet hispida (meaning \\"bristly\\"). Description The dwarf apple grows as a small tree or mallee to 7 m (25 ft) high. It has greyish flaky bark. Like other members of the genus Angophora and unlike other eucalypts, the leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem. Sitting on petiole 0–4 mm long, the leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, and measure 5–10 cm (2–4 in) in length and 3–4.5 cm (1.2–1.8 in) across, with a blunt rounded apex, and a cordate (heart-shaped) base. They are a pale yellow- green above and greyish on their undersurface. New growth is covered in reddish hairs. Flowering takes place from November to January. The showy creamy-white flower heads are terminal and umbellate, each composed of three to seven flowers on 0.8–3.2 cm (0.3–1.3 in) long pedicels, which in turn branch off from a 1.5–7 cm (0.6–2.8 in) long peduncle. Like the new leaves and stems, developing buds are covered in reddish hair. Globular in shape with longitudinal ribbing, they grow to a diameter of 0.9–1.3 cm (0.4–0.5 in). The flowers fall leaving the cup-shaped woody seed pods or fruit, which measure 1.5–2.6 cm (0.6–0.8 in) long and 1.3–2 cm (0.5–0.6 in) in diameter. These shed the mature seed in February and March. The oval-shaped seeds are brown and flat, measuring 0.8–1 cm (0.3–0.4 in) long. Taxonomy Common names include dwarf apple and scrub apple, and banda in the Cadigal language. Loddiges Nursery called it the Rough Metrosideros after the dwarf apple was described by James Edward Smith in 1797 as Metrosideros hispida, having been collected by Surgeon-General of New South Wales, John White in 1795. Antonio José Cavanilles also described it the same year as Angophora cordifolia, having been collected somewhere near the shoreline in Port Jackson. The latter name remained in use until 1976, when A. hispida was erected by Don Blaxell, who had established that Smith's name had been published four months earlier in May (contrasting with Cavanillles in September) of 1797. Smith had been sent a specimen by Surgeon-General White, which flowered in 1798. He went on to publish a fuller description accompanied by an illustration by James Sowerby in 1805. Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published a phylogenetic study based on morphology and came up with the smudgy apple (Angophora woodsiana) as the dwarf apple's closest relative. Brooker and colleagues consider it to be more closely related to the broad-leaved apple (A. subvelutina). More recently, genetic work has been published showing Angophora to be more closely related to Eucalyptus than Corymbia, and the name Eucalyptus hispida has been proposed for this species if it were to be placed in the eucalypt genus. Hybrids with Angophora costata and A. bakeri have been recorded. Distribution and habitat The dwarf apple is found only in the Sydney Basin, as far south as O’Hares Creek off the Georges River, on dry sandstone soils low in nutrients. The associated plant communities are heath, scrubland or open woodland, with such species as scribbly gums (Eucalyptus racemosa and E. haemastoma), red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera), narrow-leaved apple (Angophora bakeri) heath banksia (Banksia ericifolia), rusty banksia (B. oblongifolia), silver banksia (B. marginata), conesticks (Petrophile pulchella), scrub sheoak (Allocasuarina distyla), wax flower (Eriostemon australasius) and parrot pea (Dillwynia floribunda). It grows from sea level to an altitude of 300 m (1000 ft) and with an annual rainfall of 800 to 1600 mm (30 to 60 in). Ecology Insects foraging among the flowerheads The dwarf apple regenerates from bushfire by resprouting from its woody base, known as a lignotuber, or epicormic shoots. It can flower within a year of being burnt and plays an important role as a food source for nectar-eating insects after bushfire. The flowers attract birds such as the noisy miner and wattlebirds and a wide variety of insects, including honeybees, native bees, flies, moths and butterflies, and a wide array of beetles, including the rose chafer (Eupoecila australasiae), green- velvet flower chafer (Glycyphana brunnipes), the variable jewel beetle (Temognatha variabilis), the cowboy beetle (Chondropyga dorsalis), and a scarab beetle Bisallardiana gymnopleura, as well as members of the scarab genus Phyllotocus and soldier beetle genus Telephorus. The dwarf apple is a host for larvae of froghoppers, known as spittlebugs. Angophora hispida has been recorded as a host for the mistletoe species Muellerina eucalyptoides. Use in horticulture This is a small tree suitable for larger gardens, its red new growth and profuse white flowers are attractive horticultural features. Flowering in summer, the flowers attract brightly coloured beetles. It requires a sunny aspect and good drainage to grow well.

PLoS Biology, 16(3): e2001663. genus containing the single species Piksi barbarulna (meaning \\"strange elbowed big bird\\", from Blackfoot piksi, \\"big bird\\" or, specifically, \\"chicken\\" and Latin barbarus \\"strange, outlandish\\" + ulna, elbow(Varricchio 2002)). It lived roughly 75 million years ago in what is now Montana, United States. Known from parts of a right wing – the humerus, ulna and radius bones – the only specimens found so far are housed in the Museum of the Rockies (collection number MOR 1113). The genus Piksi is monotypic at present. The fossils were found in 1991 by Gloria Jean Siebrecht in the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, namely at Bob's Vacation Site locality TM-088, Glacier County. Recovered from an old stratum of the upper Two Medicine Formation, they are probably from an individual that died in or near a small pool. It was described in 2002 by David J. Varricchio. Description and classification The bones are fragmentary and represent roughly the elbow area. Comparing the fossils' size to the wing bones of other ground birds, P. barbarulna seems to have been about as large as a common pheasant, i.e. some 35–40 cm (15 in) long excluding tail, and with a wingspan of perhaps 80 cm (30 in) or somewhat less. It would thus have weighed some 500 g – 1 kg (1 - 2 pounds).Based on the data in Snow et al. (1998). The original description of the fossils found its affinities unresolvable except that it was probably an ornithothoracine bird. Agnolin and Varricchio (2012) reinterpreted Piksi barbarulna as a pterosaur rather than a bird, most likely a member of Ornithocheiroidea. However, it has since been noted that the humerus of Piksi possesses features which found in some theropods but not in any pterodactyloid pterosaurs. However, more recent studies have recovered it as a pterosaur again. Ecology The deposit in which the bones were found was a silty claystone. This was formed from sediments deposited during what seems to have been a rather cool phase of the Late Cretaceous:Though still much warmer than today: see Cretaceous for contemporary climate. sea levels of the Western Interior Seaway at least were apparently very low for Mesozoic standards, though this may also have been due to strong tectonic uplift in the Cordilleran Overthrust Belt. The location was inland, with the Western Interior Seaway's coast at least 350 km (220 miles) away. Judging from the stratigraphical, sedimentological and faunal data, the environment was thus probably semi-humid, possibly (seasonally?) semi-arid grassland or shrubland in a tropical or subtropical climate. The claystone apparently formed from sediment of a small floodplain, such as an ephemeral pool. A diverse fauna utilized the location as a habitat. Other theropods were plentiful, including Troodon (the nest of which was recovered), tyrannosaurids, and dromaeosaurids. Orodromeus was also abundant; herds might have come to the pool to drink or breed, as adults, juveniles and hatchlings were found together. Early mammals – metatherians and multituberculates – occurred in the area, as well as lizards. That there was a temporary though not permanent body of water is indicated by the presence of articulated frog skeletons and the absence of fish and other aquatic animals.

It has rough, stringy bark to the thinnest branches, lance-shaped or curved adult leaves, green to yellow flower buds is groups of between nine and fifteen and cup-shped or hemispherical fruit. Description Eucalyptus baxteri is a tree that grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has grey to brownish, stringy or fibrous bark from the trunk to the thinnest branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped, glossy green leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, curved or egg-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The leaves are the same glossy green on both sides. The flowers are borne in groups of between nine and fifteen in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel up to , rarely long. Mature buds are green to yellow, oval to oblong, long and wide with a rounded, conical or flattened, warty operculum about as long as the floral cup. Flowering mainly occurs from June to January and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped, hemispherical or shortened spherical capsule long and wide with the valves level with the rim or slightly above. Taxonomy and naming Brown stringbark was first formally described in 1867 by George Bentham who gave it the name Eucalyptus santalifolia var.? baxteri and published the description in Flora Australiensis. In 1926, John McConnell Black published the name Eucalyptus baxteri in Volume 3 of the Flora of South Australia. The specific epithet (baxteri) honours William Baxter. Distribution and habitat Brown stringybark grows in wet forest, woodland, heath and on coastal dunes and headlands in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. In New South Wales it only occurs south from the Nadgee Nature Reserve. In Victoria it is found in coastal and near coastal areas and as far inland as places like Casterton, Clunes and the Grampians. It occurs in the far south-east of South Australia, including the Fleurieu Peninsula and Kangaroo Island. Ecology The seeds of trees of this species that are over 100 years old are an important source of food for the endangered south-eastern subspecies of the red-tailed black cockatoo.

It first opened its doors in 1851 as a drapery store and, in its heyday, competed creditably as a department store with Myer (1900). It occupied a succession of buildings in Bourke Street until it was taken over by David Jones in 1982.Statement of significance at Heritage Council of VictoriaAn 1864 document places the firm at 27 Bourke Street East Popular as a retailer of fashionable garments, its 1914 mail-order catalogue promoted elegant frocks. In 1939, female nightwear was shown in shop windows. In fact, similar displays had caused pedestrian congestion on the footpath from as early as 1912, seen in photos of the day. In the 1920s, the store's tea room was reputedly a fashionable meeting place for ladies. History Buckley & Nunn was co-founded by Mars Buckley (1825?– 9 October 1905) and his partner, Crumpton John Nunn (1828–29 March 1891). Buckley was born at Mallow, County Cork, Ireland and emigrated to Victoria in 1851 with his wife, Elizabeth Maroon, née Neville, and their child.Hone, J. Ann Buckley, Mars (1825? - 1905) Entry in Australian Dictionary of Biography, Melbourne University Press 1969 Buckley came with goods to sell at the Ballarat and Forest Creek goldfields, which proved profitable. On the arrival of another consignment of goods in 1852 he began business in partnership with English- born Nunn as Buckley & Nunn. Nunn soon returned to England to manage that end of the business. Buckley & Nunn's first store was a drapery store in a wooden building, 9 ft (2.7 m) by 30 ft (9.1 m), with a yearly rental of £250. The next few years saw great expansion and Buckley took larger premises for £3000 a year and bought the land for £22,000, acquiring a Bourke Street frontage of 27 ft (8.2 m), soon extended to 162 ft (49 m) with a depth of 300 ft (91 m) to Post Office Place. In 1859 Buckley gave evidence to the select committee on the tariff. At that time he was employing 20 women and importing most of his goods through Dalgety. In the 1860s he established direct communications with the main British firms, and the store made annual profits of about £40,000. In 1866 Buckley helped to found the Commercial Bank of Australia. After the death of Nunn by suicide in 1891, Buckley sold the business to Robert Reid, who sold it on in London in 1892 for £300,000. The business was now called Buckley & Nunn Pty Ltd. Buckley hated publicity and took no part in political or municipal life. Buckley died at his home, Beaulieu (now St Catherine's School), 17 Heyington Place, Toorak, of heart failure at the age of 80, on 9 October 1905. He was survived by his wife and five of their seven children. Of his four surviving sons, Gerald Neville was educated at Melbourne Grammar School and bought Narrapumelap station from the executors of John Dickson Wyselaskie (1883); Percy Neville became a lieutenant-colonel and Godfrey and Charles Mars returned to England. The business was made into a public company Buckley & Nunn Ltd, which modernized the business and built the two iconic buildings on the north side of Bourke Street, the western building in 1911–12 and the eastern building in 1933–34. The business and properties were bought by David Jones in 1982, and merged into the David Jones group. The company was delisted from the ASX on 5 May 1982. Buildings In the 20th century, the firm occupied two adjacent buildings on the north side of Bourke Street. The westerly one (306-12 Bourke Street) was the Edwardian Baroque-style Buckley & Nunn Emporium, built in two stages in 1911 and 1912. The eastern building, the Men's Store (298-304 Bourke Street), was designed by the same local architects Bates, Smart & McCutcheon. The Moderne or art-deco-style building was constructed in 1933–1934. It was considered an architectural triumph and won the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects' Street Architecture Medal in 1934, being \\"a distinct departure from the traditional and thus exemplary of the modern trend in design\\".Buckley & Nunn Men's Store at National Trust of Australia (Victoria) It was decorated with male bas-relief figures in jazz-age costume, glazed terracotta panels and spandrels faced with stainless-steel chevrons and colourful musical-note symbols. The National Trust has described the lift cars and lobbies as \\"unequalled in Victoria as examples of the European 'Art Deco' geometric forms which dominated decorative art in the 1930s\\".

It was first published in 1963, by McClelland and Stewart. The novel was published as Stick Your Neck Out in the United States. The Incomparable Atuk tells the story of a Canadian Inuit who is transplanted to Toronto, and who quickly adopts the greed and pretensions of the big city. It satirized the Canadian cultural elites of Richler's day, who in the novel fetishize Atuk first as a noble savage and, when his corruption becomes apparent, as a symbol of Canadian nationalism and anti American sentiment. Many of the characters are parodies of real Canadian celebrities, including Hugh Garner, Nathan Cohen, Pierre Berton, and Nathan Phillips. A film adaptation was in the works in the middle of the 1980s to the beginning 1990s, but never followed through. The movie, which would have been simply called Atuk, has been called cursed, as several actors associated with the film died, including John Belushi, Sam Kinison, John Candy, and Chris Farley. Rumours of the script being cursed were dismissed in February 1999. Many overweight actors were interviewed for the movie, and the actors who died early were said to have lived rather unhealthy lifestyles.

Accommodation The centre has an operational capacity of 140 adult male inmates who have been deemed suitable for residency in an open centre. It has a mix of single and shared rooms. All rooms are equipped with televisions. Healthcare and Welfare Services The centre houses a medical surgery with trained staff, which is available from 8 am to 8 pm each day. Outside these hours, a doctor is available. Serious medical emergencies are dealt with at Sligo University Hospital. A visiting dentist is also available. Psychiatrists are available on call, and a Probation and Welfare Service officer is on duty from Tuesday to Friday each week. An alcohol education programme exists and is delivered to suitable offenders. Prisoner facilities Various workshops are available in the centre, and operate on a voluntary basis. Computer facilities are provided to allow inmates to develop skills in that area. A gymnasium and volleyball alley are available for recreation. Visits Prisoners may be visited on any day of the year from 10am to 5pm. The visiting facilities are designed to be family friendly, and visitors can usually bring items to the centre to give to the inmates (once they have been examined to ensure that they do not contain any prohibited items such as drugs or alcohol).

The channel launched on 13 September 2007. It was first announced on 5 August 2007, though its license first appeared on the Ofcom website in January (initially named \\"Toon TV\\", this was changed to Anime Central in June). The channel ran from 9pm to 6am, free-to-air on Sky's Digital TV Platform, channel 199; and it was the only channel broadcast in the UK and Ireland which was dedicated solely to showing anime. Anime was only broadcast between 9pm and 6am. The channel originally timeshared with Pop Girl (another CSC Media Group channel) but more bandwidth was made available removing the need for the channel to timeshare. The extra broadcast capacity was then filled with the channel ident or teleshopping. The channel was shut down on 27 August 2008 being replaced with Showcase TV but Anime Central continued to be shown as a programming block on Showcase TV every night between 4am and 6am. Showcase TV was renumbered to channel 188 in September 2008. On August 3, 2009, Showcase TV became True Entertainment and the Anime Central programming block was removed completely. Programming The regular schedule comprised six series, with a different episode broadcast every day.Anime Central - Series These made a three-hour block, which was then repeated twice through to 6:00am. Each series was usually repeated once before a major schedule change was made, unless the series was much longer than the standard length of 26 episodes.

The reasons for the change were unknown and reactions to this change on the channel's forum were generally negative.Anime Central - Forums - Schedule from late Feb Initially the channel did not broadcast in anamorphic widescreen.

Each block was repeated until 6:00am. Subtitling Although all series were initially broadcast in English, a popular topic of discussion on the Anime Central forums were member's preferences for Anime dubbed into English or in Japanese with English subtitles.Anime Central - Forums - Will Anime Central show anime in subtitles? Anime Central - Forums - should the on channel 199 be in japanese with subs? Perhaps as a result of the high demand for both, during late 2007, the last repeat of the night of Cowboy Bebop and .hack//SIGN were broadcast in Japanese with English subtitles. On-screen identity On-screen graphicsThroughout the channel's life, it had a consistent red-on-black theme. All the channel's advertising, the \\"bumpers\\", the ident cards and the website used this same theme. In response to a request from the channel's brand manager, there was some discussion on the Anime Central Forums about possibly changing the red- on-black theme (amongst other suggestions about programming).Anime Central - Forums - Anime Central Website Needs An Oil Change However, none of the suggestions were taken up by the channel. Closure and replacement In June 2008, an updated list of UK TV licenses from OFCOM no longer listed Anime Central as a licensed channel, OFCOM UK TV Licenses reinforcing the long- standing speculation on the Anime Central forums that Anime Central would soon close.Anime Central - Forums - The 'what's going with the channel/line-up' thread Anime Central - Forums - Bye Bye Anime Central However, the same OFCOM data indicated that CSC Media Group is set to start True Entertainment, prompting further speculation on the Anime Central Forums that some of Anime Central's programming could move to True Entertainment. That same month, confirmation that Anime Central's license to operate was being replaced in favour of True Entertainment, had appeared on OFCOM's monthly updates page for May 2008. Despite a fleeting suggestion on Sky's Electronic Programme Guide that a new schedule, combining content from Pop Girl, True Movies 2 and Anime Central, might start in August 2008, Sky's EPG quickly reverted to the previous schedule of triple bills and teleshopping.Sky Interactive TV guide (unfortunately, it is not possible to link directly to individual channel listings or to past channel listings) In August 2008, True Entertainment's OFCOM Licence was renamed to Showcase TV and Showcase TV launched the following day. Anime Central survived as a 3-hour block of programming from 12am to 3am, using Anime Central's original idents, DOG and continuity announcements. At the beginning of the new schedule the block carried the same triple bills of Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex that were previously seen in rotation on the full-time channel, however, in October 2008, Anime Central's slot was further reduced to two hours, showing double bills of Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. In August 2009, the last double bills of Cowboy Bebop and Ghost In The Shell were shown and Showcase TV was replaced by True Entertainment. In 2014, Sony Pictures Television bought CSC Media Group. In March 2015, Scuzz launched Animax Movie Nights, a weekly block that aired anime movies on Thursday nights until April 2015. The website was redirected to animaxtv.co.uk, which was launched in October 2013 prior to Sony's acquisition of CSC. However, it is no longer available due to the service’s closure in October 2018. Forum activity Even though the channel no longer existed as a separate channel, discussion on the channel's internet forum continued with a low level of activity.

The Ring, party established'' Norra länken (The northern link) is a motorway in Stockholm, Sweden, between the port of Värtahamnen and Karlberg, where it connects to Essingeleden. The road is part of the European route E20 and the incomplete Stockholm Ring Road. Norra länken is in length, of which are in tunnels. The part between Karlberg and Norrtull was opened in 1991, and the tunnel between Norrtull and Värtan was opened in 2014. The other parts of the ring road are the highly congested Essingeleden in the west, opened in 1966, Södra länken in the south, opened in 2004, and Österleden in the east, where () plans have been canceled. History The tunnel in October 2009 The part of Norra länken between Karlberg and Norrtull was finished and opened in 1991. As part of the Dennis Agreement (), a political agreement, the construction eastward of the remaining part to Värtahamnen was to be completed as well. The construction was cancelled in 1997 when the project was appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court which determined that the detail plan for the part between Norrtull and Roslagstull was in conflict with the law protecting the Royal National City Park. The political agreement was broken and it was uncertain whether the road project would be completed. The government and Stockholm Municipality agreed in 2002 on a new alignment between Norrtull and Roslagstull. The detail plan was again appealed, but the Supreme Administrative Court rejected the appeal on February 26, 2007, and construction resumed on May 11, 2007. The tunnel between Nortull and Värtahamnen was opened on November 30, 2014, and the total cost of the tunnel was 10.6 billion SEK.

The program of the MG focused on the abolition of private property and of the state altogether. The group aspired to have the free-market economy replaced by social planning according to the specific needs that were present. The MG emerged from the so-called \\"Red Cells\\" (Ger.: Roten Zellen), which arose in the German student movement in 1968. The MG was properly formed in the early 1970s. The MG published among other things the magazine MSZ - Gegen die Kosten der Freiheit (Marxistische Streit- und Zeitschrift; Marxist Argument and Magazine - Opposing the Costs of Liberty), the Marxistische Arbeiterzeitung (Marxist Workers’ Newspaper), various university newspapers, as well as the book series Resultate (Results), Abweichende Meinungen (Dissenting Views) and Kritik der bürgerlichen Wissenschaft (Critique of Bourgeois Science). It is thought to have had up to 10,000 members. Local associations of the MG also existed in Austria. The organization was monitored by the intelligence office (Ger.: Verfassungsschutz; Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution) and was rated \\"left-wing extremist\\". According to data collected by the office, numerous members of the MG — particularly in Bavaria — were dismissed from civil service, and some private employers were informed about MG members and asked to dismiss them. In May 1991, the MG announced its dissolution. The reason it stated was that it was expecting intensified reprisals against its members following the appearance of an intelligence office brochure about the group. The party's newspapers were discontinued, but corresponding journalistic work was continued by the publishing house GegenStandpunkt-Verlag and the journal GegenStandpunkt (Opposing Viewpoint). The communist theory of the Marxist Group=Critique of Leninism and State Socialism The MG never based itself on \\"Marxism-Leninism,\\" and sharply criticized the interpretation of Karl Marx’ theory that was forged by Lenin and handed down by communist parties. It started out from the new discussion about Marx' Capital that arose in the 1960s. On this basis, the MG did not regard the phenomena of bourgeois society as the result of the doings of individual capitalists or factions of capital, but saw capitalists and wageworkers only as \\"character masks\\" of a relationship of exploitation between capital and wage labor that is inherent in bourgeois society, i.e., based on general commodity production and the commodity character of labor power. While, for example, the German Communist Party with its theory of \\"state monopoly capitalism\\" criticized the bourgeois state in Germany primarily for letting \\"monopoly capital\\" directly influence politics in all kinds of ways and thereby thwart and corrode the at least partly \\"progressive-democratic\\" character of the political order formulated in the constitution, the MG rejected such criticisms as \\"idealistic\\", because according to its analysis, a bourgeois state is fundamentally nothing other than an \\"ideal collective capitalist\\" (Friedrich Engels), quite independent of the actions of individual capitals, and exists for no other purpose than to safeguard the private ownership of the means of production and to guarantee the basic conditions for capital accumulation with the aid of the state monopoly on the use of force. When the DKP and similar groups appealed to \\"democratic forces\\" to form alliances against right-wing and fascist tendencies, the MG accordingly rejected this as assuming democracy has nothing but humane purposes that miss the point of its supposed reason for being. After all, it claimed, it was completely normal democratic business both to \\"sort human material into useful and useless\\" and to wage war to assert the demand that all resources be transformed into objects of capital accumulation, while fascism was especially consistent in realizing the democratic ideal of a national community willing to make sacrifices for the success of the state purpose. Further, democratic pluralism institutionalized the citizens’ abstracting from their needs and interests; instead of disputing their antagonistic interests, citizens acknowledged their legitimacy and argued about alternative state policy as reflected in the various political parties. The MG was also sharply polemical about the trade unions, since by fighting for higher wages, they expressed nothing other than the workers’ fundamental agreement with the capitalistic use of their labor power. The MG denied the Leninist theory of imperialism as \\"the highest stage of capitalism,\\" in which capitalism had passed into a state of \\"rot\\" and decline — since capitalism was not to be criticized for working badly, but for working far too well. The MG's understanding of Marx focusing on \\"Capital,\\" the Critique of Political Economy, disregarded the elements in the thinking of Marx and Engels involving the philosophy of history, which \\"Marxism-Leninism\\" developed into a \\"world view\\" (\\"dialectical and historical materialism\\"). Communism The aims of the MG could be inferred indirectly from its critique of the states promoting \\"real socialism.\\" The MG accused these states of not having consistently overcome commodity production and money in favor of a planned production of use-values, but instead invented the nonsense of planning with the help of commodity-money \\"levers\\" (a term popular in Soviet economics textbooks); the contradiction between planning and the acceptance of commodity-money relations was the cause of the inconsistencies and malfunctions in the economies of state socialism. It can be concluded that the MG assumed that after a revolution based on a correct understanding of Marxist theory and the abolishment of money, supplying the population with use-values could be managed simply through a division of labor. Agitational practice Although the MG distributed newspapers and pamphlets at factory gates on a large scale, out of tactical considerations their emphasis was first of all on the universities. New members were recruited through teach-ins and meetings of sympathizers. With its positions, the MG fundamentally dissociated itself from all efforts to improve living conditions \\"within the system\\": it rejected the view that \\"fighting for concrete interests of the working population\\" would give rise to a consciousness of the necessity for overcoming capitalism. Rather, the MG criticized in its publications the false consciousness of the workers regarding state and wage labor, since only on the basis of this consciousness was a sustained participation of the exploited to be had. Unlike other communist groups, it did not call for more discussions on workers’ issues, etc. — it did not demand that science be \\"applied\\" to \\"proletarian\\" issues, and it was not interested in propagating an alternative \\"Marxist world view\\" based on a \\"class standpoint.\\" The critique of bourgeois science was of central significance for the MG. In written and oral contributions it set out to demonstrate that bourgeois science — from moral philosophy through interpretation of literature to sociological methodologies — did not develop a scientific concept of reality, but served to legitimate bourgeois society and participation therein. Sympathizers completed extensive training courses centered around the examination of Marx's Capital. This was intended to lead new adherents to understand the bourgeois world, and thus to develop a scientifically founded position toward it. Sympathizers eventually acquired the status of \\"candidate,\\" becoming full members after a few more years of training.

Career overview  Since the early 1990s, Duthoit was appointed successively Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator in Ingushetia (covering Chechnya), and then head of the OCHA offices in Uganda, Timor-Leste, Nepal, Southern Sudan, and latterly Chad. Between these appointments, she carried out short assignments with other functions in Burundi and elsewhere.  Specific achievements  In Uganda, Éliane Duthoit played an important role in attracting international attention to what the United Nations believed was a forgotten humanitarian crisis. In Chechnya, she played an important role in facilitating negotiations between the Russian military and Chechen rebels to ensure humanitarian relief for internally displaced persons (IDPs). In 2006, she was appointed by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan as head of the OCHA office in Juba, Southern Sudan, under the leadership of Under- Secretary-General Jan Egeland. This was when humanitarian needs were gradually leading the way to development, in which OCHA along with other United Nations agencies reportedly played an important role. In Southern Sudan, she also played a significant role, in facilitating negotiations at the 2006-2007 Juba talks between the Government of Uganda and the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), hosted and mediated by the Government of Southern Sudan with United Nations support in the person of Joaquim Chissano as Special Envoy of the Secretary- General for LRA-affected areas. In August 2007, with increasing humanitarian needs in Chad, she was appointed by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki- moon as head of the OCHA office in Chad, based in the capital N'Djamena.

The Ouse Valley Railway was to have been part of the London, Brighton & South Coast Railway (LBSCR). It was authorised by an Act of Parliament and construction of the long line was begun, but not completed. It never opened to traffic. Background In the 1860s, the South Eastern Railway and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway were proposing to build railways to Brighton and Eastbourne. To counter this threat, the LBSCR proposed to build a long railway linking Haywards Heath, Uckfield, and Hailsham. It accepted that the line would not be profitable but it wanted to keep other companies out of its territory. Authorisation was given to extend the line to St Leonards. One tactic to be employed by the LBSCR was to build the line as slowly as possible, delaying its opening to force other companies to look elsewhere to build their lines. Authorisation An Act of Parliament was needed to construct the line. This was sought in 1863 and granted - 26&27 Vict c.xxxv s.13, L.B. & S.C.R.(Ouse Valley Line) 1864. In 1864, authorisation was received to extend the line to St Leonards. Route The line was to leave the Brighton Main Line just south of Balcombe Viaduct and pass through Lindfield. From there it would follow the Ouse Valley to Sheffield Park and then pass north of Newick to Shortbridge and connect with the railway south of Uckfield, which was then the terminus of the line from Lewes. The line would then pass through Framfield, East Hoathly, Chiddingly and Lower Horsebridge before joining the railway at Hailsham, which was then the terminus of the line from Polegate. The line would have then continued across country to Bexhill on Sea and St Leonards. Construction and abandonment Construction of the line between Haywards Heath and Uckfield began in May 1866 – the month of the collapse of Overend & Gurney's Bank, which was a major financier of railway construction projects at the time. Work stopped in February 1867 and was not resumed. Remains There is still much to be seen of the line between Haywards Heath and Uckfield. Skew Bridge across Borde Hill Lane between Haywards Heath and Balcombe () has extended abutments where the railway would have passed over the road. Each side of the road at Borde Hill () embankments survive, with a remnant of the bridge abutment on the southern side, visible from Copyhold Lane. A cutting leads to what would have been a tunnel at Kenwards Farm (). In Lindfield an embankment at survives. Lindfield station would have been at with recently found remains of a brick-making kiln in what would have been the station yard. Near Sharp's Bridge there are the beginnings of cuttings either side of Buckham Hill where there would have been a short tunnel and south of Uckfield, an embankment and the only other completed bridge (). Although reported as destroyed during the construction of the Uckfield Bypass in the 1990s, the bridge is still in position although in decrepit state, visited but not photographed September 2009.

USGS work During World War II Roberts lived in Central America, where he had been sent to discover and conduct fundamental research on strategic minerals. After the war he returned to the United States; for the next 40 years he worked in Nevada and Utah, deciphering the geologic history of major mountain ranges and exploring mineral deposits. In 1960, Roberts published a paper that predicted the existence of important mineral-bearing rocks in Nevada.Roberts, R.J. 1960. Alignment of mining districts in north-central Nevada. US Geological Survey Professional Papers 400-B. pp. 17-19 Roberts' research led to the discovery of the Carlin and Cortez-Battle Mountain gold belts. These two mining districts now represent the richest gold region in the United States, and one of the leading gold producing regions of the world. During the 1970s he spent six years in Saudi Arabia, mapping ore deposits and contributing to the development of the Arabian mining industry. He retired from the USGS in 1981, but continued his mineral exploration in Nevada for over two decades.

The miniseries was directed by Dan Curtis and starred Richard Crenna, Daphne Ashbrook and Mare Winningham. It was partially based on Ufology Budd Hopkins' book Intruders: The Incredible Visitations at Copley Woods. Barry Oringer and Tracy Tormé wrote the screenplay. Plot Lesley Hahn lives in California, and is plagued by nightmares about faceless telephone repairmen entering her house and taking her. She contacts psychiatrist Dr. Neil Chase in hope of receiving treatment for her nightmares. Mary Wilkes, is a housewife from Nebraska who has a history of unexplained blackouts and one night ends up on a motorway miles from her home. She is also plagued by nightmares similar to those experienced by Lesley. Mary decides to take a holiday in California with her sister, who knows Dr. Chase, and is persuaded to see the psychiatrist to find out if he can help with her nightmares. Initially, Dr. Chase does not believe Lesley, thinking her nightmares to be related to childhood abuse, but becomes convinced something else is happening when Mary tells him of similar experiences. Neil is struck by the similarities between the two cases, and realises that symbols seen on board an alien ship and drawn by Mary are similar to that of another patient of his, a former soldier who encountered a crashed UFO which was recovered by the government. Making contact with a university professor who does research into alien abductions, he begins to investigate the wider world of alien encounters, and runs into a general who is investigating UFOs in secret. Finally, Mary is abducted again, and learns the true purpose of the aliens.

It serves the city of Kalgoorlie. Beyond Kalgoorlie, the line continues east as the Trans-Australian Railway. Establishment View from the station in May 1931 WAGR P class locomotive with the Kalgoorlie Express at the station in 1935 Construction of the railway station and yard was begun in the late 1890s, as part of the extension of the Eastern Goldfields Railway from Coolgardie in January 1897. The station was formally opened by the Governor of Western Australia, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Gerard Smith KCMG, at a ceremony held on the station platform on 8 September 1896. In the early stages of the development of railways in the Eastern Goldfields, it was the junction for the following railways: *Kalgoorlie to Boulder, opened 8 November 1897 *Kalgoorlie to Kanowna, opened 6 December 1897 *Kalgoorlie to Menzies, opened 24 March 1898 In 1917, Kalgoorlie became a break-of-gauge station when the Commonwealth Railways' standard gauge Trans-Australian Railway from Port Augusta opened. This ceased on 3 August 1968, when the Eastern Goldfields Railway was gauge converted.History of Rail in Australia Department of Infrastructure & Regional Development  Loop line  Surveyed in 1899, the line went from Kalgoorlie station. Due to costs and passenger decline, in 1920, some of the stations listed below were reduced in status by ceasing to be booking stations: Hannan Street, Golden Gate, Brown Hill and Trafagar. In 1921, fares increased. In 1930, the passenger service was closed. * Maritana Street Bridge * Victoria Street * Hanbury Street - the junction Western side: * Robert Street * Coombe Street * Halfway * Kallaroo Inner western side * Hainault * Fimiston * Horseshoe Boulder Loop * Golden Gate - junction * Dunlop Crossing * Clancy Street * Boulder railway station * Forrest Street * Ivanhoe Crossing * Kamballie - junction Eastern side * Trafalgar * Hillend * Brown Hill * Croesus * Williamstown Platform The platform was the longest in Western Australia, 527 m, but was eclipsed by the new Perth Terminal platform, built for the 1969-70 extension of standard gauge into Perth. At each end of the main platform are bay platforms; the three to the east (adjacent to the former water tank and signal box) were where Boulder loop line passenger services arrived, and the western one is where the current Prospector services terminate. The eastern bays were converted to standard gauge for Trans- Australia Railway, prior to the extension of the standard gauge line to Perth. Location and commemorations Due to it being the western terminus of the Trans-Australian Railway, the station has been the location of a number of commemorations and ceremonies from the opening of that railway in 1917 and since. Services Kalgoorlie is served by the Transwa Prospector rural train service and the Indian Pacific. It was also previously served by the Kalgoorlie Express, The Westland and Trans Australian. The Prospector service runs to and from East Perth once or twice each day. Indian Pacific The Indian Pacific also stops here. It runs once or twice a week (depending on the time of year) each way between East Perth and Sydney Central.

He has also appeared at Non-league level for Ossett Albion, Bradford Park Avenue and Farsley Celtic. Career Downes started his football career in Non-League Ossett Albion, before being scouted by Grimsby Town in 2002 who at the time were playing in the second tier of English football. Downes was one of many summer signings brought to Blundell Park in the summer of 2002 by manager Paul Groves. With Grimsby boasting a thick squad in all positions, Downes failed to make an impact and was only named as a substitute on several occasions without making an appearance. He was released from his contract at the end of the 2002–2003 season and subsequently joined Third Division side York City. Downes only made 6 league appearances for York before he was again released by his new club at the end of the season. Now a pipe fitter by trade, Downes went on to play for Farsley Celtic where he became the clubs favoured penalty taker in which he scored against Aldershot and Ebbsfleet in the 2007–08 Conference National season.

Five subspecies are recognized. Description The western banded gecko (Coleonyx variegatus), San Bernardino County, CA. The western banded gecko is a terrestrial lizard, ranging in total length (including tail) from . Hatchlings measure . The body is sandy-colored with dark crossbands broken into patches. The tiny scales give its skin a silky texture. Unlike typical geckos, it has prominent eyes with movable lids. Habitat The western banded gecko is found in a wide range of habitats, including creosote bush and sagebrush desert, pinyon-juniper woodland, and catclaw-cedar-grama grass associations in the eastern part of its range and chaparral areas in the west. Its elevational range extends from below sea level to about asl. Behavior The western banded gecko is secretive and nocturnal, foraging at night for small insects and spiders, and is one of the few reptiles that control scorpion populations by eating baby scorpions. If captured, C. variegatus may squeak and may discard its tail. As a defense mechanism, it can also curl its tails over its body to mimic a scorpion. Females lay up to three clutches of one to two soft-shelled eggs in the spring and summer. Emerging on warm nights around 80 °F, they can be seen around porch lights looking for an easy meal, retreating if the temperature rises too high or drops too low. Eggs hatch after six weeks. Niche Predators include leaf-nosed snakes, western patch-nosed snakes, night snakes, sidewinders, western diamondback rattlesnakes, other rattlesnake species, coachwhips, and zebra-tailed lizards Additional possible predators are tarantulas, large centipedes, solpugids, coyotes and kit foxes. Subspecies Five subspecies of Coleonyx variegatus are recognized as being valid, including the nominotypical subspecies. *Coleonyx variegatus abbotti (San Diego banded gecko) *Coleonyx variegatus bogerti (Tucson banded gecko) *Coleonyx variegatus sonoriensis (Sonoran banded gecko) *Coleonyx variegatus utahensis (Utah banded gecko) *Coleonyx variegatus variegatus (desert banded gecko) Nota bene: A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than Coleonyx. Phylogeny A study investigating the deep phylogeographic structure within C. variegatus using mtDNA analyses recovered six divergent clades throughout the species' range, with topology of the mtDNA gene tree suggesting separate origins of peninsular populations with an older lineage in the south and younger one in the north. The same study found that analyses of multilocus nuclear data provides support for four lineages, corresponding to subspecies C. v. abbotti, C. v. peninsularis, C. v. sonoriensis, and C. v. variegatus, with phylogenetic analyses indicating a single origin of the peninsular populations. This discordance is largely due to repeated episodes of mtDNA introgression that have obscured both lineage boundaries and biogeographic history. Combining the nuclear and mtDNA and applying dating analyses suggests that the peninsular clade diverged from the continental group in the Late Miocene.

In July 2005, he pleaded guilty to shooting Hussein Kamel Hadi Dawood al-Zubeidi, who had been his partner during the U.S. Occupation of Iraq. He was sentenced to serve 18 months. Berg's original claim of self- defense was initially believed, and he was awarded a Purple Heart for the event that later earned him detention, demotion and a Bad Conduct Discharge. Investigation Berg initially told investigators that he had been shot by the Iraqi police officer and then returned fire, killing him. Capt. Dan Stigall, who prosecuted the case, said Berg stuck with that story until 2004, when he admitted killing the Iraqi policeman. Berg later claimed that, while on patrol with his Iraqi partner, he had a sudden premonition that his partner represented a danger to him. So he shot him three times, killing him. Berg then shot himself in the stomach with his dead partner's weapon, so that he could claim he fired in self-defense. Berg's self-inflicted gunshot wound caused a relatively minor injury. Although Berg admitted shooting himself, his Purple Heart was never formally revoked. Court martial Berg's court martial convened on July 25, 2005. On July 26, 2005, Berg pleaded guilty to negligent homicide, making false official statements, and self-injury in a hostile-fire zone. Berg was defended by Charles Gittins, an officer in the United States Marine Corps Reserve who defends American servicemen in his civilian practice. During his guilty plea, Berg noted, \\"I feel great remorse. As a result of my ignorance, the Iraqi police officer left behind a 2-year-old daughter and a wife. I went to Iraq to make a better life for everyone else. By also shooting myself, I took away all the good I tried to do.\\" He received a six-year sentence and a Bad Conduct discharge from the U.S. Army. A plea agreement allowed him to be released after eighteen months. Reaction In June 2006 the Associated Press distributed an article on pressure within the US military justice system to impose stiffer sentences on soldiers who kill outside of the context of battle—including re-introducing the death penalty. The article listed twenty past or pending cases, including Berg's, that contributed to the pressure to start using the death penalty again. In March 2008, when Berg's unit returned to Iraq, the Indianapolis Star noted Berg's conviction, in the context of new, tighter, rules of engagement intended to prevent GIs killing Iraqis who weren't enemies. The paper quoted instructions the new commander of Berg's old battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Rodney Fogg, issued to the men in Berg's old battalion: In 2012 Alan F. Williams, a professor of law at Idaho University, wrote an article in which he claimed that the Berg case was questionably handled .

Plot  Charles Lang works at a menial job at a factory and lives with his blind sister Rita in an apartment in Chicago during the 1934 World’s Fair. But he is also an amateur inventor, and the play centers around a machine he designs that can create electricity from distilled water. Seeking to patent his idea, he finds a lawyer, Morton Gross, in the phone book and shows him the machine, but Gross’s motivations seem to differ from Lang’s. Gross recruits another lawyer, Lawrence Oberman, and together they menace Lang and eventually his sister. It is heavily implied that the two of them serve the corporate establishment whose profits Lang’s engine threatens. By the time Lang realizes he is being taken advantage of, the lawyers have him trapped. He attempts to contact a newspaper reporter, but Gross and Oberman hold his sister hostage to prevent him from telling his story. He then meets a barker at the World’s Fair right before it closes for the night who tells him of a chain letter he has just received, which gives him an idea. The lawyers try to force Lang into giving them his plans, but he says he no longer has them; the audience finds out from a scene in the newspaper reporter’s office that he and Rita have been killed. The play ends with Bernie, a young friend of the family who has previously shown mechanical aptitude, receiving the plans for the Water Engine in the mail.  Themes  The Century of Progress theme of the 1934 Chicago World's Fair informs that of the play. Technology is interspersed throughout the dialogue as the voices of various announcing figures, over radios, on physical soapboxes, and, in the case of the Chain Letter, of indeterminate origin, reinforce the notion of a rising tide of change as they herald the advent of a new technological era. The superstition represented by the Chain Letter contrasts with its eventual saving of Lang's invention and yet also coincides with it, as both the inventor and the letter seek explanations and justice in a world that often—particularly in the cases of both the lawyers, the knowingly bombastic newspaper reporter Dave Murray, and the Fair itself—seems more intent on flowery rhetoric than on the pursuit of truth or the greatest good of society. The play plays with the form of daytime radio serials, as its plot and structure, with clearly defined heroes and antagonists, riffs off the suspense thrillers that were popular around the time the play is set. That it was originally written as a radio play positions it as an homage to the genre.  Production  Originally written as a radio play for the NPR drama showcase Earplay, The Water Engine was first staged at The St. Nicholas Theater in Chicago and later at The Public Theater in New York by Steven Schachter. It opened on December 20, 1977 and ran for 63 performances. The cast included Dwight Schultz as Charles Lang, David Sabin as Morton Gross, and Bill Moor as Lawrence Oberman. On February 28, 1978, it transferred to the Plymouth Theatre on Broadway as a double-bill with a short Mamet play entitled Mr. Happiness, and ran for 24 performances. In this production Patti LuPone was featured as Rita. The play was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding New Play. The play was adapted by Mamet, Steven Bognar, Julia Reichert, and Martin Goldstein for a 1992 made-for-cable television movie produced by Donald P. Borchers, directed by Steven Schachter and starring William H. Macy as Charles Lang, John Mahoney as Mason (instead of Morton) Gross, Joe Mantegna as Lawrence Oberman, and Patti LuPone as Rita. Charles Durning, Treat Williams, Andrea Marcovicci, Peter Michael Goetz, Rebecca Pidgeon, Felicity Huffman, Ricky Jay, and Joanna Miles also were in the cast.

Set in 17th-century Delft, Holland, the novel was inspired by local painter Johannes Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring. Chevalier presents a fictional account of Vermeer, the model and the painting. The novel was adapted into a 2003 film of the same name and a 2008 play.  Background  Tracy Chevalier's inspiration for the novel was a poster of Johannes Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring. She had bought the poster as a nineteen-year-old and it hung wherever she lived for sixteen years. Chevalier noted that the \\"ambiguous look\\" on the girl's face left a lasting impression on her. She describes the girl's expression \\"to be a mass of contradictions: innocent yet experienced, joyous yet tearful, full of longing and yet full of loss.\\" She began to think of \\"the story behind that look”, imagining it as directed at the painter. Chevalier's research included reading the history of the period, studying the paintings of Vermeer and his peers, and spending several days in Delft. Pregnant at the time of researching and writing, she finished the work in eight months because she had a \\"biological deadline\\". Plot Sixteen- year-old Griet has to leave her family home in Delft in 1664 after her father is blinded in an accident. As a tile-painter, her father is a member of the artists’ guild, so employment is found for her as a maid in painter Johannes Vermeer's household. In the strictly stratified society of the time, this is a fall in status because of the bad reputation that maids have for stealing, spying and sleeping with their employers. A further complication is that the Vermeers belong to the grudgingly tolerated Catholic minority while Griet is a Protestant. At their home, she befriends the family's oldest daughter, Maertge, but is never on good terms with the spiteful Cornelia, a younger daughter who takes after her class-conscious mother, Catharina. Griet also finds it difficult to keep on the right side of Tanneke, the other house servant, who is moody and jealous. Griet lives for two years at her employers’ and is only allowed to visit her home on Sundays, where the family circle is breaking up. Her younger brother Frans is apprenticed outside and eventually her younger sister Agnes dies of the plague. But during the early months of her work at the Vermeers', Pieter, the son of the family butcher at the meat market, starts courting Griet. She has been strictly brought up and does not welcome this at first, but tolerates his interest because it is of advantage to her impoverished parents. Griet is increasingly fascinated by Vermeer's paintings. Vermeer discovers that Griet has an eye for art and secretly asks her to run errands and perform tasks for him, such as mixing and grinding colors for his paints and acting as a substitute model. This takes up much of her time, and Griet arouses the suspicions of Catharina, but Vermeer's mother- in-law, Maria Thins, recognizes Griet's presence as a steadying and catalyzing force in Vermeer's career and connives at the domestic arrangements that allow her to devote more time to his service. However, Griet is warned by Vermeer's friend, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, not to get too close to the artist because he is more interested in painting than he is in people. Realizing that this is true, Griet remains cautious. Vermeer's wealthy but licentious patron, Pieter van Ruijven, notices “the wide-eyed maid”, molests her when he can and pressures Vermeer to paint them together, as he had with an earlier maid that Van Ruijven had then made pregnant. Griet and Vermeer are therefore reluctant to fulfil this request and eventually Vermeer comes up with a compromise. Van Ruijven will be painted with members of his own family and Vermeer will paint a portrait of Griet by herself which is to be sold to Van Ruijven. For the painting, he forces her to pierce her ears and wear his wife's pearl earrings without her permission. Cornelia seizes the chance to let Catharina discover this and in the resulting scandal Vermeer remains silent and Griet is forced to leave. Ten years later, long after Griet has married Pieter and settled into life as a mother and butcher's wife, she is called back to the house following Vermeer's death. Griet assumes that Vermeer's widow wishes to settle the household's unpaid butcher’s bill. There Griet learns that Vermeer had asked for her painting to be hung in the room as he was dying. In addition, though the family is now poorer, Vermeer's will has included a request that Griet receive the pearl earrings that she wore when he painted her, which Van Leeuwenhoek forces Catharina to hand over. Griet realizes, however, that she could no more wear them as a butcher's wife than she could have as a maid. She therefore decides to pawn the earrings and pay the fifteen guilders owed to her husband from the price.  Reception  The novel was published in Britain in 1999 and a year later in the United States, where it became a New York Times bestseller,\\"Best Sellers Plus\\" The New York Times. February 27, 2000. Retrieved November 13, 2010. Though it was nominated for several fiction prizes, it won only the Barnes & Noble Discover Award in 2000Barnes & Noble website and the 2001 Alex Award for books that have special appeal to young adults. In 2001 Plume released the U.S. paperback edition with an initial print-run of 120,000 copies; a year later the book had been reprinted 18 times with close to two million copies sold.\\"This Pearl is a Diamond\\". Publishers Weekly 249.4, January 28, 2002. In 2005 HarperCollins brought out a UK special edition with nine colour plates of Vermeer paintings, published in celebration of one million copies sold.Abe Books The New York Times described the work as a \\"brainy novel whose passion is ideas\\";Eder, Richard, \\"Master Vermeer, Isn't It, Um, Missing a Little Spark?\\" Atlantic Monthly praised Chevalier's effort \\"in creating the feel of a society with sharp divisions in status and creed”.Adams, Phoebe-Lou. Atlantic Monthly 285.2, February 2000 However, Publishers Weekly noted details that “threaten to rob the narrative of its credibility. Griet's ability to suggest to Vermeer how to improve a painting demands one stretch of the reader's imagination. And Vermeer's acknowledgment of his debt to her, revealed in the denouement, is a blatant nod to sentimentality”. Reviewed 1 March 2000 Details were also called into question by the art historian Gary Schwarz, particularly the simplistic portrayal of the Catholic/Protestant division in a country where the differences between Protestants were equally important.Fletcher 2012, p.9 As well as the high English-language sales, the novel’s popularity has seen it translated into most European languages and in Asia into Turkish, Georgian, Persian, Indonesian, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese and Korean.Goodread Editions  Themes  In Chevalier's fictional account, the character Griet is the model for Vermeer's painting Rather than writing a story of Vermeer having an illicit relationship with the household maid, Chevalier builds tension in the work with the depiction of their restraint. As Time magazine notes, Chevalier presents \\"an exquisitely controlled exercise that illustrates how temptation is restrained for the sake of art\\".Sheppard, R.Z. \\"A Portrait of Radiance\\" Time. January 9, 2000. Retrieved November 13, 2010. The restraint is also a function of the distanced style that Chevalier chose for her narrator, Griet. It has been noted that its aim is to replicate Vermeer’s style of painting. It concentrates particularly on visual detail, both in the appearance of characters and of domestic surroundings, and their spatial placing in relation to each other.Fletcher 2012, pp.11-12 It is this cool approach that differentiates the book from the three other novels published in 1999 which also deal with 17th century Dutch painting. Susan Vreeland’s Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a set of stories centred upon a supposedly lost painting by Vermeer;Vreeland site and Katharine Weber’s The Music Lesson deals with the stolen Vermeer painting of that title.Weber site Deborah Moggach’s Tulip Fever, on the other hand, is set in Amsterdam and also deals with the love between a painter and his subject. In addition, it too started from an attempt to decipher the enigmatic look of the sitter in a painting of the period.Moggach site Another theme - that is demonstrated in the narration rather than commented on overtly - is how women of that time, in Lisa Fletcher’s words, “did not own their bodies, but were the possessions first of their parents, then of their employers, and finally of their husbands. As the novel progresses, Griet becomes increasingly aware that she is ‘for sale’\\".Fletcher, Sheffield Hallam University She is given no choice by her parents over whether or where she will work. Van Ruijven and other characters assume she is sexually available simply because she is an unchaperoned maid. And once Pieter becomes Griet’s accepted suitor, her parents leave her alone to his physical advances, anticipating that the match will be to their benefit. Historical materials Apart from Girl with a Pearl Earring itself, in which Griet is the sitter, several more of Vermeer’s paintings feature in Chevalier’s novel.Fletcher 2012, p.8 At the very start, View of Delft is recalled by Griet’s father.Page 7 in the HarperCollins paperback (2000) When Griet enters the household, Vermeer is working on Woman with a Pearl Necklace and Tanneke mentions soon after that she had been Vermeer’s model for The Milkmaid.HarperCollins 2000, p.36ff, p.40 His next subject is Woman with a Water Jug, for which the baker’s daughter models. Griet describes the painting to her father and also witnesses its creation in closer detail now that she is helping in the studio.HarperCollins 2000, pp.96-7, 106-8 Van Ruijven’s wife (Maria de Knuijt) later models for A Lady Writing a Letter. During this episode it is recalled that she had previously appeared in Woman with a Lute and that her husband had seduced the maid who sat for The Girl with the Wine Glass.HarperCollins 2000, p.135ff Van Ruijven himself, a sister and a daughter, figure in The Concert,Harper Collins 2000, p.184ff which is conceived of as a successor to The Music Lesson.HarperColllins 2000, p.163 A final painting, The Procuress, is not Vermeer’s painting of that title but a genre piece by Dirck van Baburen that belongs to Maria Thins. This hangs on the wall to the right of The Concert.HarperCollins 2000, p.179 These paintings that survive compensate for the lack of much real information available in the historical record about the main male characters. That has allowed Chevalier to integrate into her imaginary scenario some of the few facts that are known about Vermeer and so give her fiction the appearance of reality.Tracy Chevalier TED Talk, 5.45-7.50 But scarcity of evidence extends outside the Vermeer household as well. Although Antonie van Leeuwenhoek is known to have acted as executor to Vermeer’s will, there is no documentary proof of friendship between the two. Van Leeuwenhoek was certainly interested in optical devices and it has been speculated that Vermeer made use of a camera obscura, but that is as far as the evidence goes.”Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723) and Johannes Vermeer”, Essential Vermeer Again, there is a high level of probability that Pieter van Ruijven was Vermeer’s patron, since 21 of the artist’s paintings belonged to his estate, but no documentary evidence survives. And there is certainly not the slightest hint that he was the sexual predator that Chevalier portrays.”Pieter van Ruijven”, Essential Vermeer Such considerations are important since, as Lisa Fletcher argues, historical novels “intervene in our view of the past” and influence our reaction to it in the present. Thus it was noted that the 2001 exhibition of “Vermeer and the Delft School” at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York “attracted almost twice the number of visitors than the Vermeer exhibition held at the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1996. For Walter Liedtke, the gallery's curator of European paintings, the success of [the exhibition] was due, at least in part, to Chevalier's novel.”Fletcher, Sheffield Hallam University See also * Girl with a Pearl Earring (film) * Girl with a Pearl Earring (play) ReferencesBibliography * Tracy Chevalier, Girl with a Pearl Earring, HarperCollins paperback, London 2000 * Lisa Fletcher, Chevalier's Girl with a Pearl Earring, Insight Publications 2012 * Lisa Fletcher, \\"His paintings don't tell stories...\\": Historical Romance and Vermeer, Sheffield Hallam University Category:1999 British novels Category:Novels set in the Netherlands Category:Novels about artists Category:Cultural depictions of Johannes Vermeer Category:HarperCollins books Category:British novels adapted into films Category:British novels adapted into plays Category:Novels set in the Dutch Golden Age Category:Works about Johannes Vermeer ","title":"Girl with a Pearl Earring (novel)"},{"id":"12724824","text":"Sir William Armine, 1st Baronet (11 December 1593 – 10 April 1651) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1621 and 1651.

The stadium, built in 1948-1950, consisted of a football field and running-track, had a seating capacity of more than 19,700. Renovations in 1958 improved the quality of the football pitch, improving athletic conditions. In 1978 the stadium was destroyed presupposing that the new one will be constructed for Olympic team training, but no financing came from Moscow, so Vladimir had no stadium until 1988 when Vladimir Tractor Factory found a way to get extra money from Soviet Ministry of Transport particularly for sporting needs. The quality of the building was poor, so until now it has already had several repairs. This year the big reconstruction is to be started - the tender will be led on 21st of August 2007.

Petre was the eldest son of Robert Petre, third Baron Petre (1599–1638), and Mary (1603–1685), daughter of Anthony-Maria Browne, second Viscount Montagu, who had been arrested in connection with the Gunpowder Plot in 1605.Burke's Peerage Vol. 3 p.3118 Petre was openly a Roman Catholic. A political storm broke in 1678, when Titus Oates alleged, with the support of Lord Shaftesbury, that Petre was involved in the mythical Popish Plot to murder Charles II, was part of a conspiracy to reimpose the Catholic faith on England, and that he had been appointed by the Jesuits as lieutenant- general of a Catholic army of invasion.Kenyon p.36 Petre was arrested and charged with high treason, together with four other Roman Catholic peers, Lord Arundel of Wardour, the Earl of Powis, Lord Stafford, and Lord Bellasyse. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London and entered a plea of not guilty, but no trial was ever held.Kenyon p.95 In November 1678, Charles II gave the royal assent to the second Test Act which removed all Catholic peers, including Petre, from the House of Lords. However, the paucity of evidence to substantiate the charge of high treason, and the weakening of the Whigs in 1681–82, lessened the chances of Petre being convicted, and he continued to be held without trial.Kenyon p.231 In August, 1683, Petre predicted that he would be \\"cleared by about next spring\\", but then his health broke down. In December, Lady Petre petitioned Charles II unsuccessfully to release her husband on medical grounds. Expecting death, Petre wrote a final declaration to defend the Roman Catholics against the 'Popish Plot' charges. He died on 5 January 1683/84.Kenyon p.280 Biography William was the eldest son of Robert Petre, 3rd Baron Petre (1599–1638) and his wife Mary Browne,Burke's Peerage Vol. 3 p.3118 and the nephew of William Petre, the translator of Ribadeneira. He was only eleven years old when his father died, and this made him a ward of the King. He spent his childhood in the care of Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton. The family's finances were under strain, as the First English Civil War broke out. William, the young Lord Petre, was royalist fighting for in Warwickshire. His estates were seized by the Commonwealth, and in 1644 Sir Henry Vane the Younger moved in the House of Commons an ordinance for raising £3,000 out of Lord Petre's estate for the recruiting of Colonel Harvey's regiment of horse. Civil War The estates in Essex and London were initially sequestered for delinquency and recusancy; Petre was cleared of the charge of delinquency in February 1647; he received one third of his estates back, the Commonwealth put different stewards in charge to see that the rents were rightly divided, one third going to Petre and two thirds to the Parliament. The estate was leased at the time to Chaloner Chute for £1,300, and there were many difficulties in apportioning the obligatory payments. Lord Petre, however, managed to get a larger share than his one third, and in 1647 the local court reported that he holds courts at Ingatestone privately and made many thousands of pounds. As the war progressed, he lost two thirds of his Devon lands. Petre resorted to many tactics to use to the full the lands that he retained, to cover his capital losses, and to postpone or to ease his payments to his dependants. Other members of the family fought for Charles I and met with misfortune in consequence. Peter Whetcombe does not appear to have given complete satisfaction as steward, for in 1650 Lord Petre had Peter Whetcombe and others summoned for cutting and carrying away timber from his estate. To which they pleaded in defence Parliament's order for raising £3,000 by sale of his wood (perhaps the ordinance for funding Colonel Harvey's regiment of horse was never fulfilled). Whetcombe further pleaded that he had only cut and sold decayed timber and undergrowth. Arthur Barnardiston was appointed, and shortly after Mr. Richard Greaves, of Lincoln's Inn held the office, and was directed to keep court on Lord Petre's estate. Nevertheless, by 1651, Petre's liabilities, with sequestration, were twenty times his income, and although the liabilities were not all due immediately, the fourth lord was under pressure that was not manageable. In 1652, it was necessary for him to sell part of his inheritance. The alternative to the sale of his estates was to renounce his Catholic faith. He chose this alternative, and in May 1652, he took the Oath of Abjuration before the Lord Mayor of London, John Kendrick. By this act of apostasy, Petre recovered his estates, but it is clear from his last letter, written in the Tower to Charles II shortly before his death, that he died a Catholic. No composition fine was imposed, and the sequestration of his estates was lifted on 29 June 1652. This act opened the road to recovery, and Petre, at times with the assistance of trustees, successfully recovered the family's finances. By December 1658, the principal of the debt was down to £12,150, while annual interest on the debt was £2,708. In 1655, Lord Petre reports himself ill and lame, and begs that he may be examined about his affairs at his own lodgings, which was granted. He was one of the Royalist ‘cavaliers’ imprisoned at Oxford in 1655, but until well advanced in life did nothing to attract public notices. In 1658, he was in custody, and seeking passes for himself and his servant to France, or beyond the seas. In 1659 Bulstrode Whitlock wrote to Colonel Fagge and other militia commissioners of the county of Sussex: \\"Concerning Lord Petre, Council have received such satisfaction from various well-tried friends that you may liberate him if he will pass his honour to Colonel Fagge to live peaceably, and not abet anything to the prejudice of Parliament.\\" Marriage His first wife, Elizabeth Savage, (d. 1665) was the daughter of John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers and his first wife Catherine Parker. She was a notorious spendthrift who was less than scrupulous about paying her debts. In his diary, Samuel Pepys, who was acting as agent for his relative William Joyce, a chandler who was attempting to recover a debt he was owed by Lady Petre, makes no secret of his opinion of her \\"a drunken jade\\",Pepys' Diary 26/04/1664 and a \\"lewd woman\\", though he admitted that she was handsome and high- spirited.Pepys' Diary 4/04/1664 She could also be notably vindictive, as William Joyce found to his cost when she brought a counterclaim against him and had him imprisoned for default. Pepys tried to mediate but found her implacable, saying that she would have her revenge even if it meant going to Hell.Pepys Diary 18/4/64 It was said that her husband found her impossible to live with: Pepys himself saw them quarreling in public.Pepys' Diary 4/04/1664 Lady Petre died in July 1665.Burke's Peerage Vol. 3 p.3118 Although by then she was separated from her husband,Pepys' Diary 4/04/1664 she was buried in Lord Petre's family vault. William was living quietly in that retirement forced upon Catholics, ostracized from all influence, but as a devout Roman Catholic he involuntarily drew upon himself the attention of the perjurer Titus Oates and fame was thrust upon him at the time of the imaginary \\"Popish Plot\\".Kenyon p.36 Popish Plot  In 1678 Oates swore in his deposition before Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey that he had seen ‘Lord Petre receive a commission as lieutenant-general of the Popish Army destined for the invasion of England from the hands of Father d'Oliva (i.e. Giovanni Paolo Oliva), the General of the Jesuits.' The country was in ferment at once, and the wildest excitement prevailed.Kenyon p.93 To a certain substratum of truth (for example all the priests he named did exist and he knew some of them personally, and Oliva was the Jesuit Superior General), Titus Oates added many lies, making it exceedingly difficult to separate the guilty from the innocent, and many persons were unjustly condemned and punished. He repeated these statements, before the House of Commons in October 1678, and the House promptly sent for Lord Chief Justice William Scroggs, and instructed him to issue warrants for the apprehension of all the persons mentioned in Oates’s information.Kenyon p.95 William was arrested with four other Roman Catholic lords – Powis, Belasyse, Arundel and Stafford – who were similarly accused of being destined for high office under the Jesuitical regime, Petre was committed to the Tower on 28 October 1678.Kenyon p.95 Some of those who, it was claimed, had been accessory to the plot, were tried and either executed or acquitted, but some were kept in confinement for years without trial. Lord Petre was one of these. The commons exhibited articles against him in April 1679. For a short time, he had as fellow prisoner Mr. Samuel Pepys, who had been accused of being a Papist, and of selling Navy information to the French. John Evelyn writes in his Diary. Yet, in spite of repeated demands for a trial by the prisoners’ friends, and of the clamour of the partisans of Oates on the other hand, no further steps were taken until 23 June 1680, when the Earl of Castlemaine, who had subsequently been committed, was tried and acquitted. A few months later Viscount Stafford was tried, condemned and executed;Kenyon p.231 but the patrons of the plot derived no benefit from his death, and nothing was said of the trial of the other ‘popish lords’, though the government took no steps to release them.Kenyon p.230 What saved Petre and the other peers from the scaffold was the death of the informer William Bedloe in August 1680. Under English law two eyewitnesses were required to prove an act of treason, and unfair though the Plot trials generally were, the judges were scrupulous in observing this rule.Kenyon p.87 Other than Titus Oates there was no remaining witness against Petre and no strong witness against the other three.Kenyon p.231 Their confinement does not appear to have been very rigorous. Nevertheless, Petre, who was already an old man, suffered greatly in health, and when, in the autumn 1683, he felt that he had not long to live, he drew up a pathetic letter to the king. In this he says: This letter was printed, and provoked some Protestant ‘observations’, which were in turn severely criticised in ‘a pair of spectacles for Mr. Observer; or remarks upon the phanatical observations on my Lord Petre’s letter’ possibly from the prolific pen of Roger L'Estrange. Lord Petre was fortunate in so far that he did not lose his head, but he protested his innocence in vain; it was remembered against him that undoubtedly foreign Papists had frequented Ingatestone Hall. It was useless to expect a Stuart to remember and feel any gratitude for the fact that Lord Petre had suffered and fought on the Royalist side so few years ago. Even the discovery in 1683 of the Rye House Plot (called in the register by Rector Ewer ‘the Phanatic Plot’), to assassinate Charles and James and set the Duke of Monmouth on the throne, failed to create revulsion of feeling in Lord Petre's favour, and he was doomed to remain in confinement.Kenyon p,230 Death Baron Petre died before anything was done. His death occurred on 5 January 1684. He did not die in vain, for at once the English public compassion forced the issue with regard to all the prisoners for the supposed plot. A writ of habeas corpus on 12 February 1684 was issued and the judges of the King's Bench declared that these men should long ago have been admitted to bail.Kenyon p.280 The death of Petre did much to awaken fair-minded men to the iniquitous disabilities under which Catholics were suffering, and no Catholic suffered death for his religion after his death. Baron Petre was buried among his ancestors at Ingatestone on 10 January 1684 laid in the old family vault, his coffin resting on that of his distinguished ancestor, Sir William Petre. There is no monument or slab placed in the church to his memory, probably because he left no son, and only one daughter, Mary, by his second wife, Bridget (1652–1695), daughter of John Pincheon of Writtle. Mary, who was born in Covent Garden on 25 March 1679, married on 14 April 1696, George Heneage of Hainton in Lincolnshire, and died on 4 June 1704.Burke's Peerage Vol.3 p.3118 From \\"Catholic Martyrs of Essex\\" (B. Foley 1950), \\"This martyr died in prison, a confessor, if not a martyr for the Faith, and his death aroused such an outcry and so much compassion that it was instrumental in virtually putting an end to open persecution.\\" There are four portraits of William; it is strange that he should have felt himself able to afford such extravagance. With the fines and estate sequestrations of the Commonwealth, his financial position was precarious and it is said that much of the original furniture of Ingatestone Hall had to be disposed of at that time. His aged mother survived him just a year, and was buried on 17 January 1685, on the north side of the then new south chancel, and not in the vault with her husband and son. No pictures of the fourth baron's wife or of his mother are known to exist.

Its mission was to create charter schools to serve impoverished students, starting in Donna, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley. Tracy Epp was a Teach for America colleague who helped them write the charter, joined the board of IDEA, and became the first principal of the first IDEA high school in 2003 and in 2008 became IDEA's Chief Academic Officer.Staff, Art/Sci, Vol 5(1) Fall 2008 Tracy Epp Devotes Her Career to Educational Justice By 2008 IDEA had 10 schools and was serving 4,000 students and by 2010 IDEA had 14,000 students on a waiting list for its schools in the Rio Grande Valley. In 2011 the Austin school district contracted with IDEA to take over Allan Elementary, a school with a 95% low-income student population, and run it as an in-district public charter school starting with the 2012 school year. However many parents and an offshoot of the Occupy Austin protest group opposed the plan, claiming that the school was being used as an experiment to create education reform in the city. Many parents withdrew their children from the school, and IDEA had to recruit from outside the neighborhood and even outside of East Austin to get students. The school district cancelled the contract in 2012, and IDEA opened a new school in its own IDEA school district and on its own land about nine miles south of the Allen. About 80% of the students elected to go to the IDEA school starting in 2013, leaving Allan Elementary empty and unused and taking about $60 million over the subsequent seven years out of the Austin school district. In 2012 IDEA opened its first school in San Antonio when former basketball player David Robinson invited IDEA to take over Carver Academy, a private elementary school he had started in 2001; in the next three years IDEA opened five more schools there.Kathleen Petty for San Antonio Magazine. August 2015 Charter Choice: Charter School Growth in San Antonio IDEA's Contract for Charter with the State of Texas was renewed in 2015 and expires in 2025.State of Texas. February 2, 2015 IDEA Charter renewal application and grant As of 2015 it served about 19,000 students in 36 schools, about 85% of whom were economically disadvantaged. In 2016 IDEA was in advanced negotiations to establish schools in El Paso and in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and received a $16M donation to expand its operations in Austin from three schools to 26 schools. In 2018 the San Antonio city government allowed IDEA to issue tax- exempt bonds, which are less expensive than the kinds of bonds it could previously issue. San Antonio-area public school districts protested the move, stated that this would cause charter schools to cannibalize them. In 2019 IDEA announced plans to expand in the San Antonio area after the United States Department of Education issued it a $116 million grant. It also announced plans to establish charter schools in Greater Houston. Teachers According to the Houston Association of Realtors (HAR) and based on 2015 data, 24.5% of teachers were currently beginning their first year of teaching at IDEA, 60% had about 1 to 5 years of experience while 9.8% had 6 to 10 years of teaching experience. Around 5% of teachers had 11 to 20 years of experience while less than 1 percent had over 20 years of experience. In terms of ethnicity, the teacher population was 1.6% Asian/Pacific Islander, 2.9% African American, 77.4% Hispanic, 17.6% White and 0.3% were of two or more races. IDEA officials said in 2016 that about 12% of their teachers were Teach for America corps members. Schools Individual IDEA schools usually launch on their own land with only three or four grades: kindergarten, first, and second grades in an \\"Academy\\" (as IDEA calls their primary schools), and a sixth grade to seed a \\"College Preparatory\\" school, which combines middle school and high school. It fills in the rest of the grades over the next six or seven years. IDEA has offered preschool programs. When IDEA prepares to launch a new school, it markets the school door-to-door. Student life As of 2016 around 95% of IDEA students were Hispanic, around 85% were economically disadvantaged, for around 33% English was a second language, and 5% of IDEA's students had special education needs. Each campus requires students to wear a polo shirt with the IDEA logo and campus name and khaki or navy pants. Students must keep their hair neat; for young men no facial hair is allowed and their hair must be short, and young women can wear only light makeup. IDEA schools hold a \\"College Signing Day\\" event each year to celebrate academic achievement, at which seniors announce the college to which they have been accepted. In 2016 IDEA said that 62% of graduates were the first people in their family to attend college. Academics Admission is carried out by lottery, but students who have a juvenile record or a history of disciplinary problems may be excluded. The schools have a reputation for being academically rigorous. In 2016 the student to teacher ratio was 22; the statewide ratio was 15.2. Most of the curriculum for kindergarten through second grade is scripted. In all levels students in a given class are grouped be skill level and are regularly assessed, and group assignments changed accordingly. Groups move through defined sequences of lessons. All classes are taught in English. Students cannot advance to sixth grade without passing the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness (STAAR) exam in 5th grade, and they cannot advance to 9th grade without passing the STAAR exam. Students get three tries and tutoring, and if they still fail, they are held back. About 15% of students in an IDEA school in eighth grade are no longer there by eleventh grade. Students take courses to learn the skills needed to take Advanced Placement courses beginning in sixth grade and in ninth grade they take their first AP course. They are scheduled to take eleven AP courses. According to IDEA's student handbook as of 2015, students are eligible to graduate “only if the student successfully completes the curriculum requirements identified by the SBOE (State Board of Education), has been accepted into a 4 year college or university, has completed a minimum of 125 hours of community service, and has performed satisfactorily on required end of course assessment instruments.”IDEA Student handbook Archived June 5, 2016. Originally linked from Idea Resources page. As of 2016, about 65% of students who enter 9th grade to do not graduate at an IDEA school. Finances Like other public schools, IDEA schools get state funding on a per-student basis, and they also get federal funding on a per-low-income-student basis from the federal government under Title I. In its 2015 audited financial statement IDEA reported having about $445M in assets (cash, incoming grants, land, buildings, etc); in 2014 it had about $356M. It reported about $213M of income in 2015, with about $12M coming from cities or towns, about $164M from state funding, and about $37M from the federal government, with about $13M of that for child nutrition; its expenses were about $194M. Bonds Like many charter schools, IDEA fueled growth by selling bonds which were treated as risky by the bond markets; in 2013 it raised $63M by selling bonds rated BBB by Standard & Poor’s and priced to yield 4.5 percent, or about 1.5 percentage points more than the standard rate.David Mildenberg for Bloomberg News.

Dr. Ed Fuller, a professor at Pennsylvania State University has said that IDEA schools do not enroll \\"underserved\\" students. Antonio Limon, a San Benito school Superintendent, criticized the district for \\"cherry picking\\" its students. Limon claimed that IDEA picked higher performing students when holding lotteries for admission. Torkelson has denied these claims, stating that schools host \\"transparent, public lotteries.\\" Limon, however, said that even though lotteries are hosted, the district keeps the \\"best\\" students, while taking out the lower performing ones. AlterNet, a progressive news outlet and Independent Media Institute project, criticized IDEA for eliminating \\"critical thinking\\" in the district's curriculum, placing board members from banking organizations to generate profit for the school and taking taxpayer money to create expansion. The source has commented that IDEA board members belong to organizations such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and the International Bank of Commerce. IDEA's organization status was also criticized for taking \\"public subsidies\\" to continue operating. Although the school often \\"boasts\\" that it has a near 100% rate of its graduates going to college, students cannot graduate unless they have been accepted to college.

Early life and education Othmer was born in Omaha, Nebraska on May 11, 1904. He attended Omaha Central High School, then gained a scholarship to the chemical engineering program at Armour Institute of Technology (now Illinois Institute of Technology), in Chicago. However, he changed to the University of Nebraska, graduating in 1924 in Chemical Engineering. He completed a Masters at the University of Michigan in 1925 and completed a doctorate in chemical engineeringwith a thesis entitled \\"The effect of temperature, purity and temperature drop on the rate of condensation of steam\\" at the same university in 1927. Professional life From 1927 to 1931 he worked as an engineer at the Eastman Kodak Company in Rochester, New York, producing 40 patents. In 1932 he joined the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn as an instructor in the newly independent Department of Chemical Engineering. He was to remain there. In 1937 he became Head of Department, which continued until 1961, when he was named Distinguished Professor. His duties ended in 1976 when he was made Professor Emeritus, but he never officially retired and was actively involved with what was by then the Polytechnic University until his death on November 1, 1995. In 1950, following a divorce, he married his second wife, Mildred Jane Topp, also from Omaha, and an English major from the University of Nebraska. They were together for 45 years and she died in 1998. Accomplishments He was a teacher for nearly 60 years, supervising many masters and doctoral students. While an academic, he continued to invent, and is credited with more than 150 US patents, as well as 350 papers, including important ones on the theory and practice of distillation. In 1945, together with Dr. Raymond Eller Kirk (1890–1957), a chemist at the same institute, he began the work which became the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, a major reference work. (At that time the only comparable reference work was Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, in German.) In 1947 the first volume was published, and it was completed in 1949. The fifth edition was completed in 2007 with 27 volumes. For this and other achievements he received awards from the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, the American Chemical Society, the American Institute of Chemists and the Society of Chemical Industry. In 1987 he received the New York City Mayor’s Award of Honor for Science and Technology. He was named by the readers of Chemical and Engineering News as one of the 75 greatest chemical scientists ever. Beginning with a $25,000 investment in a Warren Buffett partnership in the early sixties, the Othmers accumulated a substantial stake in Berkshire Hathaway. At the time of Mildred Othmer's death, their estate totaled more than $750 million, much of which was disbursed in major bequests. These included Polytechnic University, Long Island College Hospital, Brooklyn, the University of Nebraska and the Chemical Heritage Foundation, resulting in the Othmer Library of Chemical History. A major bequest was made to Planned Parenthood of New York, resulting in the Othmer Institute. He and his wife had supported many other causes in their lifetimes, particularly in the fields of local history, medical care and institutions related to chemistry and chemical engineering. They are commemorated by buildings and awards including the AIChE Sophomore Academic Excellence Award.

Publishers Weekly said, \\"Bauer creates a witty and resilient narrator in...Harley Columba... Readers will be rooting for this sympathetic heroine.\\" In the Thomson Gale biography, the authors noted that: \\"Readers and reviewers often found the strength of Bauer's novel in the authentic voice of its heroine, Harley. Patricia Morrow, for example, in Voice of Youth Advocates (VOYA), remarked that 'Harley's voice is true to the experience of many young people,' and that 'Although the outcomes are not unexpected, they do not follow any formulas.'\\"Voice of Youth Advocates, October, 2000, Patricia Morrow, review of Harley, like a Person, p. 260 right Life Bauer is the oldest of five children. She was born on an Air Force Base where her father was stationed in Greenville, South Carolina. According to family lore, she was struck by ball lightning while sleeping in her bassinet during a thunderstorm. She spent the first five years of her life in Kearney, New Jersey in the same three-family house as her paternal grandparents, and her summers at the Bauer family property on Bodin Lake in Upstate New York. Her grandfather was the foreman of Kearfott, where her father was also an engineer. When she was nearly five years old, her grandparents relocated to Montreat, North Carolina, while her immediate family moved to Pompton Lakes, New Jersey, a small, suburban town in North Jersey which Bauer has fictionalized in her novels as \\"Lenape Lakes\\" -- \\"only forty-five minutes outside of New York City, if there's no traffic, although it may as well be four zillion light-years away since no one from here ever goes there.\\" Bauer learned to read and use the slide rule before she went to kindergarten, and began writing books at the age of six. She showed musical ability at a young age, and played the clarinet, piano, violin and guitar, and was also active in the theater. Bauer graduated with honors from Pompton Lakes High School in 1973.Barry, Jan. \\"Author Revisits Scene Of Novel -- Tells Students Dreams Can Come True\\", The Record, December 12, 2000. Accessed August 14, 2007. \\"Cathy Bauer couldn't wait to graduate from Pompton Lakes High and get out into the world.\\" After a brief marriage to her high school sweetheart, she moved to the West Village in New York City, and studied acting with Stella Adler and the National Shakespeare Conservatory. Acting career She later moved to Los Angeles, California to pursue an acting career, and was active in the LA theater scene as both an actress and a playwright, co-authoring and performing in the cult hit, \\"Peacocks.\\"Koehler, Robert. \\"Stage Beat 'Peacocks' at the Deja Vu / 'Summer Storm' at the Mise En Scene / 'Jack and Beanstalk' at Celtic Arts Center / 'Scrambled Eggs' at Al's Bar\\", \\"Los Angeles Times\\", January 8, 1988. She was a close friend and student of the late Don Richardson , whose former students also included Grace Kelly and Anne Bancroft. Bauer assisted Mr. Richardson with his book \\"Acting Without Agony,\\" and it was in his workshop that she met her future husband, television director, James Quinn, noted for one-hour episode shows such as Law & Order. During this period, Bauer lived in the hills of Los Feliz. Writing career In July, 1993, Sassy published her first short story, Run Away, which was the inspiration for her first novel, Harley, Like a Person. Under the working title of \\"Zee,\\" that effort was the recipient of the very first Sue Alexander Most Promising New Work Award given by the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators (SCBWI). Selected from manuscripts submitted for individual critique at the SCBWI Annual Conference in Los Angeles, the award is given to the manuscript deemed most promising for publication. Another in the list of \\"firsts,\\" Bauer's winning entry was critiqued by Walter Dean Myers, the first-ever Michael L. Printz Award winner, a prize which recognizes excellence in young adult literature. Bauer later changed the title of her first novel to Harley, Like a Person, which was originally published in 2000 by Winslow Press, a boutique publisher that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2002. John Lennon's life and work were major influences on Bauer, and her novels are peppered with references to the former Beatle. For example, Harley Columba was born on the anniversary of John Lennon's death, December 8, while her parents were attending a memorial concert in his honor. In 2004, Holly Bolstad of White Bear Lake, Minnesota, won her state Level I Letters About Literature competition, a national reading-writing contest sponsored by the Center for the Book in the Library of Congress, together with Target Stores, by writing to Cat Bauer about how Harley, Like a Person had affected her life. To enter, readers write a personal letter to an author, living or dead, from any genre—fiction or nonfiction, contemporary or classic, explaining how that author's work changed the student's way of thinking about the world or themselves. In April 1998, Bauer moved to Venice, Italy, where she lives today on the Grand Canal. She is presently divorced. Bauer was also a regular contributor to International Herald Tribune's Italian supplement, Italy Daily, writing about the art, culture and architecture of Venice. Her popular blog, Venetian Cat - Venice Blog has been featured in the Financial Times Arts & Weekend Magazine. On May 27, 2004 the Honorable Prudence Carter Beatty signed an Order reverting all rights to Harley, Like a Person to Bauer. That book was republished in a slightly different form in 2007 by Alfred A. Knopf, a division of Random House, Inc., New York, together with a companion novel entitled, Harley's Ninth, which takes place all on one day, October 9, John Lennon's birthday.

He held 140 patents, many of them secret. Biography Busignies became interested in amateur radio at an early age, and graduated from the Jules Ferry College in Versailles. In 1926 he received his degree in electrical engineering from the Institute Normal Electro Technique in Paris, having obtained his first patent, for a radio compass. In 1928 Busignies joined ITT Corporation's Paris Laboratories, where he developed radio direction finders, airplane radio navigation devices, and early radar systems. In 1936 his equipment automatically guided an airplane from Paris to Réunion island off the coast of Madagascar, in the first practical demonstration of an aircraft guidance system. During World War II his inventions were instrumental in radio direction finding, including four secret patents relating to the automatic high-frequency direction finding (Huff-Duff) system used to locate German U-boats. Busignies had escaped from German-occupied Paris with his wife and working models, ultimately making his way to the United States, where the inventions were implemented first along the East Coast, then the West Coast, with another 30 to 40 fixed stations located around the world. About 1,000 smaller systems were installed on aircraft carriers and destroyers, as well as a further 1,500 mobile systems for the Army Signal Corps. He was also closely involved in early development of Moving Target Indication (MTI) radar during the war. After the war, Busignies remained in the United States, where he rose steadily through ranks of ITT's senior management, ultimately becoming the corporation's Chief Scientist. His inventions included contributions to Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) technology, conical scanning and 3-dimensional radar, gunfire and shell trajectory control, and deception systems. He also played a large role in development of ILS, TACAN, VORTAC, phased arrays for communications, and the use of dipole needles in orbit for reflection of radio waves (Project West Ford). He retired from ITT in 1975. Busignies was an IEEE Fellow, and given an honorary Doctor of Science by Newark College of Engineering (1958), and the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute (1971). He received numerous other awards and honors during his career, including notably the IRI Medal from the Industrial Research Institute (1971), the IEEE Edison Medal (1977), and the Armstrong Medal from the Radio Club of America. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering (1966), and served as chairman of several of its committees.

However, at £907 a copy it was expensive, and prone to overheating, so the Admiralty asked Lieutenant W. O. Bentley, an established pre-war engine designer, to produce a modified version to solve these problems. Bentley came up with his idea of an engine - fitted with aluminium cylinders with cast iron liners, and aluminium pistons. Dual ignition was introduced to improve reliability, and the stroke increased to which allowed power to be increased to . The cost of the engine was also reduced, falling to £605 per engine. The resulting engine, initially known as the A.R.1 for \\"Admiralty Rotary\\", but later called the BR.1 (\\"Bentley Rotary\\") was manufactured in quantity, although initially against Admiralty orders. It was standardised for the Camel in RNAS squadrons, but unfortunately there were never enough to entirely replace the inferior and more expensive Clerget engine in British service, and most RFC Camel squadrons continued to use Clerget engines; in fact licensed production of the Clerget continued.

Douglass was named after Frederick Douglass, who was admired by William Rush-Plummer, the one-time owner of the land (approximately ) where the Douglass neighborhood currently stands. Geography Douglass borders Hyde Park and Hollywood and is surrounded by railroad tracks to the north, south and west. South of Douglass is the neighborhood of Binghampton, to the southeast is Nutbush. History=Beginnings William Rush-Plummer was born into a life of slavery in the Southern States in America. He was the only son of a white slave master, William Rush Sr. and his mother, a slave from Africa. Mrs. Rush demanded of her husband, that young William Rush Jr. not be given the Rush family name. As a result, William Rush Senior, modified his son's name giving him a hyphenated last name. William Jr. was renamed, William Rush-Plummer. Slavery in the South was eventually abolished. When that time arrived, slaves were promised and a mule. Although many newly freed slaves did not receive the promise at that time, William Rush Sr. gave William Rush-Plummer in North Memphis, Tennessee. He turned his land into a community and name it after Fredrick Douglass, a man he had come to befriend and admire. William Rush- Plummer was ordained in his young adult years and began to develop the land now known as the Douglass Community in Memphis, Tennessee after his family was released from slavery (see and a mule). Plummer had a strong resemblance to his father and a similar proper speech pattern (with a heavy southern dialect). He began opening many churches on his land including St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church (Need More Missionary Baptist Church), St. Stephens MB Church, St. John MB Church, St. Charles MB Church and at least three other local churches that were later sold to local Pastors and their congregations. From the very beginning, Christianity played a vital role in the Plummer family and the lives of families in the Douglass Community due to William Rush-Plummer's vision. In 1900, William Rush Plummer and his associates had a vision that a church was needed for the community. Under a bush arbor in Douglass Park, the first church known as \\"Need More\\" was established. Plummer, known as “Father Plummer” deliberately gave the church this name because he felt it needed more of everything: shelter, chairs, and people. Saint Paul Missionary Baptist Church In 1902, ‘Need More Church’ moved to a new location for worship on Ellington Street and was given a new name, \\"Saint Paul Missionary Baptist Church\\". Rev. Plummer served as the church's first official pastor. He was succeeded by Bolton, followed by Anderson. The church moved in 1905 to its present location at 1543 Brookins Street. Memphis, Tennessee. Although Rev. William Rush-Plummer was among the Missionary Baptist Denomination, he gave each of the churches that he built, Catholic Church names. Rev. J.E. Ferguson became the fourth pastor of the church on the third Sunday in June 1931. He resided in a home directly across the street from the church. Realizing that education had to be perpetuated in the community, Saint Paul Missionary Baptist Church allowed Douglass High School to hold classes in the early 1900s when the school was blown away by the \\"Great Storm\\". In 1935, the School burned to the ground and once again, St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church opened its doors. Ferguson permitted the school to hold classes under the leadership of Mrs. Susie Crawford, principal and later Mr. Lucky Sharpe until the new school was built the following year. To further serve the community, St. Paul was, also, used as a social center for feeding the poor. Rev. Ferguson served as pastor of St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church for 60 years until his death on April 16, 1991. Harry Davis, a resident of the Douglass community on Oriole Street, was elected as Pastor, on the first Sunday in July 1991. He is currently the Pastor. Under his leadership, St Paul Missionary Baptist Church, was re-documented under the name of St. Paul (Douglass) Missionary Baptist Church under the direction of Pastor Harry Davis and is a landmark in the “Historic Douglass Community.” Over the years, through several generations, the name ‘Rush’ began to fade. New generations unaware of the family's history simply stopped using the full last name in the mid-1900s. Today the Plummer family seldom uses the name Rush, unless historical matters are being discussed. The Plummer family's official last name, although it may not show up on their birth certificates is Rush-Plummer. Church of the Living God, Missionary Baptist Church  Pastor Maggie- Judith A. Fluker-Campbell, (Pastor Maggie Campbell) is the great-granddaughter of William Rush-Plummer and the granddaughter of Rev. Plummer's daughter, Evangelist Maggie B. Plummer-Trout, a faithful member of Pentecostal Church of God in Christ. Her husband was Willie Trout Sr. with whom she had a son, Willie Harold Trout Jr. Evangelist Maggie Plummer insisted on the day Pastor Maggie Campbell was born that she be named after her. When her mother, Evelyn Fluker-Williams refused, initially naming her Judith A. Fluker, Plummer wrote the name Maggie in the margin of the birth certificate form followed by a dash[-] next to the name Judith, which led to her first name to this day as Maggie-Judith. Her mother Evelyn Fluker-Williams and her father Willie Harold Trout Jr. never changed it. Pastor Maggie Campbell has been a member of St. Paul ‘Douglass’ Missionary Baptist Church since birth. She was baptized at the church at the approximate age of 12 years. She was trained by her grandmother and members of her family in Evangelism since her teen years. She accepted the calling on her life at the age of 13 years while attending St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church under the late J. E. Ferguson. Pastor Maggie Campbell left Memphis in 1985 and established residents in California while serving on active duty in the United States Navy where she had the opportunity to travel around the world. She established her first ministry in support of women and children in 1993 in Oakland, California. Pastor Maggie Campbell lives in San Diego, California. She officially established an official covenant partnership between St. Paul Douglass Missionary Baptist church and her California-based Maggie Campbell Ministries on December 18, 2005. She became the first woman in her family's history to become an ordained Pastor. She was ordained on Friday, October 13, 2006, in Southern California. Shortly after her ordination Pastor Maggie Campbell and her husband, Alvin Campbell established a new church in Palmdale, California and dedicated it to her great grandfather, the late William Rush-Plummer called, ‘Church of the Living God’, www.churchlivinggod.com on February 4, 2009. They have continued their affiliation and ministry partnership with St. Paul Douglass Missionary Baptist Church. Alvin and Pastor Maggie Campbell opened the ‘Church of the Living God’ (Missionary Baptist) in memory of Pastor Maggie's great-grandfather Rev. William Rush-Plummer where Women in Ministry Leadership receive specialized training and Official Ordination with a goal to plant more churches to continue to edify the Word of God. Pastor Maggie has have assisted graduates of the Women in Ministry Training Institute with establishing churches and ministries in California, New York, and Chattanooga, Tennessee Missionary Baptist Association established In September 2010, Pastor Maggie Campbell established the “Missionary Baptist Association” (MBA), In support of Women in Ministry Leadership. One of the purposes the MBA is to bring together churches with like faith and aspirations to fellowship with one another within the MBA in California and nationwide, to encourage non-denominational churches to join with the Missionary Baptist Church family, to organize retreats and reunions as well. The Missionary Baptist Association later became the \\"Annual Women's Conference\\" which is held annually in May between Mother's Day and Memorial Day. The Annual Women's Conference The Women's Conference welcomes women of all ages, religious backgrounds, and non-religious affiliations. The purpose: To aid women in healing and to deal with the adversities of everyday life. The Women's Conference, through the Church of the Living God [CLG], strives to inspire, motivate, educate and support women including with their education and career aspirations. CLG believes women should support one another's efforts, goals, and aspirations. Mature women should reach out to the younger women to help teach them life skills and the younger women should embrace our mature women who are full of wisdom to help lead and guide them along the way. The Women's Conference cover the topics that are important to women that are oftentimes not discussed in Church services such as, but not limited to: Forgiveness, the Power of Prayer, Alternative Lifestyles, Sex outside of Marriage, Pro-life / Pro-choice issues, God's Covenant of Healing, Entrepreneurship, personal and professional growth, women in ministry leadership and so much more. No one understands the issues of women more than other women. The Women's Conference includes 3 days of praise, worship, inspirational music, pastoral sermons, motivational speakers, musical celebrations, fellowship, networking opportunities for women, breakfast, receptions, and dinner. Pastor Maggie Campbell Accepts the Call to the Office of Bishop The Church of the Living God and its affiliate churches and ministries collectively congratulated Pastor Maggie Campbell on her acceptance of the Call to the Office of Bishop on May 7, 2013. Hereinafter, she was officially addressed as, \\"Bishop Maggie Campbell\\". http://conta.cc/17oFkXL Bishop Campbell has worked hard - following in her great grandfather's footsteps William Rush-Plummer for more than 10 years to equip many women and some men to succeed in ministry. She has continued to work for years as the Overseer of churches and ministries, have helped graduates to plant new churches in New York, Tennessee, and California. She has staffed many existing churches in the Antelope Valley in California and several locations outside of the State with newly ordained, trained and equipped Women of God. As the professor over the 'Women in Ministry Leadership Training Institute', Bishop Campbell has taught women who are now Pastors, Ministers, Evangelists, and Missionaries; several of which are senior pastors or associate pastors at churches in the Antelope Valley as well as various cities across the United States. She is the first female Pastor in her family of male pastors dating back to the 1800s and is therefore now the first woman to be called to the Office of Bishop in her family. The duties and responsibilities of which she is required to do, she has been doing for many years prior to her official acceptance date of May 7, 2013. Bishop Campbell's new status opens the doors for many Women in Ministry across the country and within the Rush-Plummer and Fluker families. She is obviously an intelligent woman with multiple gifts that she uses to continue to edify the Word of God and for the Body of Christ. A role model to women and teen girls, she is a woman of God who has put in an extreme amount of hard work. She has shown qualities that she openly shares with all Women in Ministry who are willing, ready and able to do what God has called them to do as well. Bishop Campbell's dedication and perseverance has manifested itself into one of the best 'Women in Ministry Leadership Training Institutes' in America. It continues to grow each year. We all should be proud of her. Many women seek her guidance and the opportunity to train within the programs she teaches because they know she will give more than 100% of herself to making sure they receive what they need to succeed. It all began in the Douglass Community in Memphis, Tennessee - Founded by her great grandfather, William Rush-Plummer. Education The Douglass community is home to Douglass Elementary School on Ash Street. Since the school was built through early 1963-64 school year, the Douglass community also had a Junior High School for grades 7–9 as well as a high school grades 10–12. In the mid-1970s students passing from the 6th grade into Junior high were bussed to Gragg Junior High School on Jackson Avenue right outside the Douglass community where the student body was initially completely caucasian students. When students passed from the 9th grade to the 10th, they were bussed to Craigmont High School within the Raleigh community. The Raleigh community was a newly built community with a brand new high school with little to no windows. It resembled a prison from the outside. Within this school, various nationalities came together under a staff of caucasian teachers who were not equipped and experienced to teach African American or multiethnic children. Shortly thereafter, students were given the option of returning to their original schools, such as Douglass High School when they entered the 10th grade. Not all students returned to Douglass High School. Many remained at Craigmont High School in the North Memphis, Raleigh community. Douglass Community has a Community Center on Ash Street were full-time and Directors and part-time workers of the community center where employed over the years. One of the most successful directors was Terry E. Fluker Sr., a graduate of the original Douglass High School with a full scholarship to Alcorn State University for baseball. Terry returned to Memphis after attending the University at Alcorn in Spring 1977. Becoming the Director of the Douglass Community Center from 2000 to 2014. He retired on January 14, 2014. While in high school Terry Fluker, Sr. lead Douglass High School to the 1973 District Championship, where he scored 14 points in the last quarter with a unique left-handed jump shot. He was an outstanding player on the school's baseball team as well and currently plays in age 40 years older [MABL] adult baseball leagues. He currently has 2 national championship rings for the years 2005 and 2006 from this league. Terry was inducted to the Alcorn State University Sports Hall Fame in the sport of baseball inducted in 2011. In July 2019, Terry was awarded an 'Outstanding Volunteer Service Award' from the Douglass National Alumni Corporation, J. D. Springer Award, at their 41st convention held in Long Beach, California July 11-14, 2019. His volunteer service includes 4 years as a volunteer coach for Douglass High School baseball team. Terry helped secure donations for the team, coordinated old school vs. new school basketball games, and recruited the players. Recent alumni players played in July 2018. Douglass High School The original Douglass High School served the neighborhood in 1938. It burned to the ground and resumed meeting at the church [Need More] the first of six churches founded by William Rush-Plummer. The next school was built in place of the damaged one and used from 1946 to 1981. The original Douglass High school was closed due to low attendance after many of the children from the community had grown up and moved away. In an old community, Douglass High School did not have enough students available to keep the school open. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. It was torn down without the consent of the Rush-Plummer family in the Summer of 2006. Rush-Family member and the Great Granddaughter, Maggie Judith Fluker-Campbell, of William Rush Plummer, the founder of the school, opposed to the destruction of this \\"National Reister of Historic Places', Landmark. But alumni members of Douglass High School pushed forward with the demolishing the original school without consulting with Pastor Maggie Fluker [Plummer]-Campbell under the direction of the School Superintendent at that time to make way for a new school. The new Douglass School opened for the 2008–09 school year, with an expected enrollment of at least 800 students. The New Frederick Douglass High School opened under the leadership of Janet Ware Thompson, a 1975 graduate of Douglass High School. It is one of the oldest but newest Memphis City Schools, with a state-of-the-art 1,500-seat varsity gym, a 1,100-seat auditorium, a football stadium (with a track) in the middle of Douglass Park, and baseball stadium at the northeast corner of Douglass Park.

Fluker, Sr., Director of the Douglass Community Center for 32 years, retiring January 14, 2014. Community=Recreation Douglass Park, located behind the original and new Douglass High School, is where many children have come together since the 1960s for the Day Camp during the summer months under the direction of the late Evelyn Fluker-Williams, the Director of Douglass Park during the 1960s–1970s. In Douglass Park, children such as Bishop Maggie Campbell [Maggie-Judith Fluker], her sisters, brothers, cousins and many children from the community were taught how to play such sports as basketball, swimming lessons, tennis, children's theatre, arts, and crafts, and they competed against other Parks in Memphis. A women's rights activist, Election Poll Supervisor, and a very patriotic leader, Director Evelyn Fluker-Williams required the children to fully participate in the Flag Ceremony daily and work at the Election polls including Bishop Maggie Campbell.

Economy Douglass has several different factories in the area as well; some are still active while others are not, and all are tied into a rail line connecting several factories' docking areas including John Morrell Meats (now a subsidiary of Smithfield Foods). Douglass borders Hyde Park and Hollywood and is surrounded by railroad tracks to the north, south and east. For many years, residents could not leave the community most days of the week without being blocked in by stalled railroad cars or slow mile long cars day after day. Many residents have had bad experiences crossing the tracks by foot and by auto. Many accidents over the years have been documented. Though promises were made to build an overpass as far back as the early 1970s, this project never materialized.

The festival was previously held annually on the last weekend in July since 1979. It was the largest free festival in the Southeastern United States, attracting over 350,000 people. The festival consisted of six stages scattered on various street corners in Asheville. A designated area called Arts Park typically featured several dozen regional artists and their work. Displayed art covered a variety of media types including painting, photography, pottery and jewelry. A variety of music genres were represented at the festival, including country, blues, folk, mountain, rock and jazz with both local and nationally known musicians represented. In 2013, the 35th annual Bele Chere festival was announced as the final festival by the City of Asheville. Gallery File:JonathanScales.jpgJonathan Scales at Béle Chére on July 23, 2010 File:Stephanie Morgan.jpgStephanie Morgan at Bele Chere 2009 Economic impact A 2007 survey of businesses in downtown Asheville indicated that for more than 80% of respondents, the festival was bad for business, resulting in significant revenue declines during the days on which it is held. Two factors contributing to this were the large number of non-local vendors arriving for the event and the rise in vandalism during the festival.

She served in the Polish Army and associated organizations from the age of 18 and, following her retirement, became the first Polish woman to be promoted to Brigadier-General in 1991. Early service Maria Wittek was born and grew up in the Russian partition of Poland. Her father, Stanisław Wittek, a carpenter, was a member of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) and moved with his family to Ukraine in 1915 to avoid being arrested by the Russian authorities. Maria while in high school joined the Polish scout troop in Kiev. She then became the first female student in the mathematics department of Kiev University. At the same time she joined the clandestine Polska Organizacja Wojskowa (Polish Military Organization) - and completed the NCO training course. In 1919 she joined the Polish army group that was fighting the Bolsheviks in Ukraine. Then in 1920 as a member of the Women's Volunteers she fought in the battle for Lwów (now Lviv) and was awarded the highest Polish medal Virtuti Militari for the first time. Newsletter of the Polish Ministry of Defence (in Polish) Between the wars From 1928 to 1934 she was the commander of the Przysposobienie Wojskowe Kobiet - an organization training women for military service. In 1935 she was appointed the head of the women's division at the Institute of Physical Education and Military Training in Bielany, near Warsaw. In World War II During the Invasion of Poland (1939) she was the commanding officer of the Women's Military Assistance Battalions. In October 1939 she joined the underground ZWZ which later became the Home Army. She was head of Women's Army Services on the staff of gen. Grot-Rowecki and later gen. Bor-Komorowski.

On the Oxberry Master Series Stand,Oxberry Cameras the compound (platform) of the animation stand moves East-West and North-South or varying degrees of these parameters and tilts at angles up to 45 degrees in any direction with combinations that cover the compass rose. In the meantime the camera, mounted to a steel track, moves up and down relative to the subject being filmed. The E-W/N-S movement combinations and scans are done with a motorized compound that rotates and tilts. Backlighting can also be applied beneath the compound platform to create special visual effects. Photograph of downtown Rochester shows two of the scene plots used in the film: a zoom to horizon and pan across, and a street-corner zoom from medium close-up. Verticals, diagonal pans, up-zooms and other combinations were used to abstract several scenes from a few 4X5 color transparencies taken by aerial photographer---effectively simulating smooth helicopter and aircraft cinematography at a fraction of the cost. Usage (LEFT) Animation planner Francis Lee reviews bar-sheet as producer-director Raúl daSilva determines scene design plotting. A recorder was used for play-back of sound mix simultaneously transferred from master track along with 35mm magnetic film and 16mm reserve transfers. (RIGHT) Max Seligman or New York’s Tele-Craft analyzes mix on 35mm magnetic film transfer, breaking down music changes, phrases, to frame numbers. Analysis is the step prior to exposure sheet plotting for the Oxberry shooting. Oxberry Master Series animation camera stand filming made possible the pinnacle of the application of this technique and it was brought to a high art form and technique by writer-director Raúl daSilva working with camera stand operator, Francis Lee, in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s for communication, instruction, promotional and advertising motion pictures. The June 1969 issue of American Cinematographer, the magazine for the American Society of Cinematographers, contains a cover story written by Raúl daSilva on the art of Photoanimation (see cover insert) with a comprehensive description of the possibilities of this craft.American Cinematographer, June 1969 In making such films the soundtrack is first produced, analyzed and bar sheets made depicting the soundtrack details. Exposure sheets for filming (camera exposures) are then abstracted from the bar sheets. When skill and planning are applied one can take a series of stills and/or objects through a combination of movements blended with a compilation of photographic effects. One of the most elaborate examples of complex, combined photoanimation shooting is demonstrated in Raúl daSilva’s critically acclaimed, six-time international film festival prizewinner, Rime of the Ancient Mariner with Sir Michael Redgrave which was produced between the years 1973 and 1975. In this film the director brings together the art of several illustrators spread throughout two centuries, artists who attempted to breathe life into the epic poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Not only is there a seminal display of the collected art work but through the photoanimation technique combined with sound and music a unique visualization of the poem was created. Photoanimation techniques, as stated above, were used from the very early days of motion pictures but not at this level of sophistication and complexity. Hollywood often leaned on this less expensive technique for some of its movie trailers in the early era. From the 1980s on filmmaker Ken Burns (The Civil War and other films for PBS) popularized a simpler, less complex form of photoanimation later called the Ken Burns Effect.

History In the early months of World War II, weather support was unorganized and consisted of small groups of forecasters and observers attached to bombardment groups. In order to provide organization and centralization of Air Force Weather Agency, the 15th Weather Squadron was created. The 15th Weather Squadron was established 10 April 1942, and activated at McClellan Air Force Base, California, 22 April. With approximately 235 men, the squadron moved from McClellan Field to a staging area in the International Harvester Building in Oakland, California, 16 June. Where the Weather Squadron departed for Melbourne. In the later part of July and first part of August, the Headquarters in Melbourne were busy sending men to different weather locations in Australia stretching from Melbourne to Cape York Peninsula. About half went on a long rail trip north to Townsville, Queensland (approximately 1,000 miles). From their new headquarters location in Townsville, Queensland, the squadron could better support the network of stations located throughout Australia and New Guinea that were providing reliable weather information to the heavy bombardment groups then actively bombing Japanese installations in Papua and New Britain. By the end of World War II, more than 719 weathermen were assigned to 21 units in Australia, 23 units in New Guinea, eight units in the Philippines, and 17 units in the East Indies. The weathermen of the 15th WS were daring, courageous, and brave in their attempts to record the weather for the United States Army Air Forces. Besides the daily job of observing and forecasting the weather, the forecasters and observers attached to bombardment groups accompanied the planes on their missions adding in-flight weather information to the data and weather reports that were being transmitted over the network of weather and communications systems. Some came under attack by the Japanese, suffered the same routine of nerve-wracking bombing raids, ground attacks, disease, and discomfort that other ground and service forces endured. When the Japanese Army's advance was stopped, the men in the 15th WS accompanied United States Army troops and services forces to set up new weather stations at each of the islands they took back. In addition, some of the weathermen of the 15th Weather Squadron were selected for special training in guerrilla warfare for duty in the Philippines and in other areas of the Southwest Pacific. Recent history The 15th Operational Weather Squadron was formed as part of the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force's weather reengineering effort and commenced operations on 19 February 1999. The 125-person regional forecast center reaches full operating capability in June 2001 and provides direct meteorological support to the Tanker Airlift Control Center and total force flying missions in the northeast United States. The 15th Operational Weather Squadron was the recipient of the United States Air Force Fawbush-Miller Award recognizing the Outstanding Operational Weather Squadron performing the most outstanding weather support, operations, and training. During 2000, the squadron pioneered the use of database and web technologies to produce and disseminate over 3 million forecasts for 126 Air Force and Army active duty, guard and reserve flying units in a 22-state area of responsibility. Their total integration with mission planners re-routing weather restricted C-5 Galaxy and C-17 Globemaster III missions ensured pinpoint selection of favorable air refueling tracks and airfields resulting in cost avoidance in excess of $12M. The 15th Operational Weather Squadron, Scott Air Force Base, IL., was the first of the four OWS's to re-align under the newly formed 1st Weather Group during a ceremony 25 May 2006. The 26th OWS was realigned at Barksdale Air Force Base, 22 June 2006. Next, was the 25th Operational Weather Squadron at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base on 6 July 2006, and the last addition to the team was the 9th Operational Weather Squadron which was re-activated on 20 July 2006 at Shaw Air Force Base.

It involves two 17-year olds, Max Doyle (Dillon Casey) and Jessica Carpenter (Nina Dobrev) who think that they are in love and decide to get married, despite their parents' disapproval. Shortly afterward, the two begin to realize they have very different views on the future. The film was directed by Michel Poulette and based on a story by Elle Triedman. Polly Draper, Allison Graham, Anna Hopkins, James O'Regan and Amanda Tilson also acted in the film. Too Young To Marry was first aired in the US on July 9, 2007, on Lifetime. Plot summary In Connecticut, Max and Jessica are a high school couple and very much in love after meeting as freshmen. Max has an interest in construction, while Jessica's ambition is to be an orthopedic surgeon. Jessica lives with her mother and younger sister. She must contend with the aftermath of her parents' acrimonious divorce. She still believes in the meaning of true love when she allows Max to sneak into her bedroom so that the couple can spend more time together. Their plan is to attend Harvard University. When Jessica's father, Roger, reveals that his girlfriend, Kelly, is pregnant and they are going to get married, Jessica and her sister are shocked and disgusted. Jessica's father expects his older daughter to tell his ex-wife of the impending marriage. When Jessica sees her mother arrive home after a bad date with a philatelist, she does not reveal to her what her father has told her. Jessica discovers that Harvard has accepted her. She and Max are ecstatic. The couple are then less than enthusiastic when Jessica and Max learn that Harvard has deferred Max's acceptance. Matters improve for the couple when Max proposes to Jessica on Valentine's Day. He feels that he has never been more sure of anything and that they are ready to spend the rest of their lives together. He loves his fiancé because of her optimistic attitude, the fact that she is headstrong and her ability to make things work. Jessica immediately accepts and feels that in spite of the proposal, she will still attend Harvard. Jessica and Max announce their engagement plans to both sets of parents. As a consequence of Jessica's young age (i.e. seventeen), she requires consent from her parents. Roger feels as if his daughter will be compromising her university education and does not wish to play a part in Jessica and Max's marriage. Max's father supports his son's decision because he feels that Jessica is a terrific person and that he and his wife also married at a young age. Jessica's mother makes her daughter promise that she will finish college and earn her degree, as well as use birth control. On Jessica's wedding day, Roger begs his daughter not to go through with the marriage. Max and Jessica get married and live at Jessica's home, as her mother gives them permission. Tensions arise when Max moves his trophies into the room and Jessica becomes slightly uncomfortable. In spite of this, Max and Jessica seem happy to spend the rest of their lives together. Unfortunately, Harvard rejects Max. Jessica shows her ability to rectify situations when the couple rents off-campus accommodation because they want to be together. Jessica meets Sophie and Carter, two freshmen. They are curious and surprised about Jessica's marriage. Jessica and Carter share a romantic kiss after she hears him play his guitar at a local bar, but Jessica tells him that it must never happen again. Tensions arise between Jessica and Max when Max forgets to pay the electricity bill, although he does make an effort to make good his wrong by preparing a candlelight supper. Jessica also becomes even more annoyed with her husband when he reveals that he does not want to attend college. When Max sees Carter and Jessica having a drink together, Jessica stays at Sophie's for a trial separation from Max. Later, when Max tries to apologize to Jessica, she realizes that he has been kissing another young woman. Carter and Jessica spend more time together. This culminates in the two kissing passionately, which Jessica stops. Outside Carter's place, they run into Max and another young woman. Max and Jessica both move back to their respective homes temporarily. Max's parents encourage him to get an annulment or divorce. Jessica's mother advises her that a test of a strong marriage is the ability to get through challenging times. When the couple has dinner together, Max reveals that he has started to fill in college applications and that he has been offered an internship at an architect's office. The film ends with Max and Jessica making a concerted effort to rebuild their marriage.

Nattō is produced by fermentation by adding the bacterium Bacillus natto, which also produces the enzyme, to boiled soybeans. While other soy foods contain enzymes, it is only the nattō preparation that contains the specific nattokinase enzyme. In spite of its name, nattokinase is not a kinase enzyme (and should not be pronounced as such), but a serine protease of the subtilisin family (99.5% identical with aprE). Rather, it is named for the fact that it is an enzyme produced by nattōkin (納豆菌), the Japanese name for Bacillus subtilis var natto. When in contact with human blood or blood clots, it exhibits a strong fibrinolytic activity and works by inactivating plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). Although it should be expected to be digested and inactivated in the human gut like other proteins, a few researchers report that nattokinase is active when taken orally. Nattokinase is sold as a dietary supplement. It can now be produced by recombinant means and in batch culture, rather than relying on extraction from nattō.

A native of Stockton, California, he played professional baseball from 1896 to 1903, including two years in Major League Baseball with the Cleveland Spiders in 1899 and the Detroit Tigers and Philadelphia Athletics in 1901. He compiled a .231 batting average in 158 major league games. He ranked second in the National League with 81 errors in 146 games at shortstop during the 1899 season. Early years Lochhead was born in 1876 in Stockton, California. His father died in 1878, leaving Lochhead's mother to raise him and his three siblings. He grew up in Stockton and attended Stockton High School. Professional baseball=Stockton and Sacramento (1896-1900) Lochhead began playing professional baseball in 1896 as a pitcher and shortstop for the Stockton team in the California League. He also played for Sacramento Gilt Edges in the Pacific Coast League from 1898 to 1900. Cleveland Spiders (1899) Lochhead made his major league debut as the starting shortstop for the 1899 Cleveland Spiders, widely regarded as the worst baseball team in history. The 1899 Spiders had a 20–134 record (.130 winning percentage), scoring 529 runs and allowing 1,252. Lochhead has the dubious distinction of sometimes being referred to as the worst regular player on the worst team in history. His .238 batting average was 43 points lower than the league average (.281) and among the lowest among all starters in the National League in 1899. His 81 errors was by far the highest on the Spiders, though his .909 fielding percentage was on par with other National League shortstops that year. He led the team in appearances, playing in 148 of the Spiders' 154 games. His 81 errors ranked second in the National League at any position, but he also ranked second among the league's shortstops with 493 assists, third with 319 putouts, and fourth with 54 double plays. Stockton, Butte, Detroit and Philadelphia (1900–01) On April 3, 1900, the Detroit Tigers purchased four former Spiders: Lochhead, Sport McAllister, Dick Harley, and Suter Sullivan. However, Lochhead did not join the Tigers in 1900, opting instead to return to California where he played for the Stockton Wasps in the California League. He sustained an ankle injury during the 1900 season that slowed him for the remainder of his career. He also played part of the 1900 season for the Butte Smoke Eaters, batting .382 in 34 at bats. After the Tigers became a major league team in 1901, Lochhead played only one more game for the team. In four at bats, Lochhead had two hits, was hit by a pitch, and scored two runs for the Tigers, for a .500 batting average and .600 on-base percentage. The Tigers sold Lochhead to the Philadelphia Athletics on April 29, 1901. Lochhead batted .088 in nine games for the Athletics. He also made nine errors in 37 chances at shortstop for a .757 fielding percentage. He played his last major league game on May 15, 1901. Return to minors (1901-03) Lochhead continued to play in the minor league until 1903 with the Syracuse team of the Eastern League (1901), the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern Association (1901), and the Fort Worth Panthers of the Texas League (1903). He was a pitcher for Fort Worth in 1903, compiling a 16-19 record. Later years After retiring from baseball, Lochhead lived with his mother in Stockton, California, working as an attendant at the state hospital. He later worked as a bartender in Sacramento. By 1908, Lochhead had become ill with a liver ailment described by some sources as hepatitis and by others as cirrhosis. In August 1908, Lochhead died at age 33 at his mother's home in Stockton, California. He became lost in the desert with a group of friends near Bakersfield, California, in July 1908, and the exposure in the desert aggravated his poor health.

The purple and red Saffron Tower is currently the tallest building in Croydon. Saffron Square is part of the Croydon Vision 2020 regeneration plan for the London Borough of Croydon to add to its goal of being London's Third City. The area was developed by Berkeley Homes. Planning permission for the tower was given in April 2008, and construction began in 2011, with completion in 2016. History Saffron Square in May 2014 In the mid 2000s, the development of tall buildings was being encouraged in the London Plan, which would lead to the erection of new skyscrapers over the next few years as London went through a high-rise boom. By 2008, the site, on main Croydon thoroughfare Wellesley Road, had lain fallow for over ten years. The project aimed to start in 2008 with completion in 2012, however, construction started in 2011. By June 2013, the tower's construction was well underway with its final completion expected in 2015. As of early 2014, a large part of the project had been completed. Upon completion, Saffron Square would be the tallest residential tower in Croydon, with 414 private apartments and penthouses. Saffron Tower was nominated for the 2016 Carbuncle Cup for the ugliest building of the previous 12 months, but the award went to Lincoln Plaza in Docklands.  Plans  Berkeley Homes' proposals for this key northern gateway site include: *A new town square accessible to all and integral to the design. Offering a public environment to the large number of people who work in Croydon. *A 43-storey tower incorporating a light feature to the Croydon skyline. *Approximately 800 new homes, a proportion of which will be for affordable/key worker housing. 10% will be for shared ownership housing. *3,000 m² of retail floorspace including shops, restaurants and cafés surrounding the public square. *Sustainable initiatives to minimise the scheme's impact on the environment. A significant proportion of the site's energy requirements will be met by on site renewable energy sources. *Creation of improved permeability and safeguarding of future pedestrian links between East and West Croydon stations.

Vacancy  The vacancy had arisen when Scotland's second most senior judge, the Lord Justice Clerk, Lord Alness, retired. It was a long-standing convention that when a vacancy arose in this office (or in the most senior judicial office, that of Lord President), the Lord Advocate (head of the Scottish criminal justice system) of the day would be appointed to fill the vacancy. The Lord Advocate in 1933 was Sir Craigie Mason Aitchison, K.C., M.P., and so he was appointed to the bench, automatically resigning his seat. Aitchison had been elected as a member of the Labour Party in a 1929 by- election following the death of Robert Climie. In 1931, the Labour Government had split, with a handful of Labour MPs, including Aitchison, following Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald into a coalition National Government with the Conservatives. These MPs were expelled from the Labour Party and called themselves National Labour.  Candidates  The National Labour candidate was 37-year-old Kenneth Lindsay, who had contested the 1924 and 1929 elections as a Labour Party candidate in English constituencies. The parties in the National Government did not contest by-elections when vacancies arose in seats held by other parties in the government, so the Unionist Party and the National Liberals did not field candidates. The Labour Party candidate in Kilmarnock was Rev James Barr, hoping to regain the seat which Labour had won in 1929. John Pollock stood for the Independent Labour Party, and Sir A. M. MacEwen represented both the National Party of Scotland and the Scottish Party (the two parties united the following year to form the Scottish National Party).  Result  With the Labour vote split three ways, the result was a victory for Lindsay, who was elected with less than 35% of the vote, one of the smallest vote shares ever for a by-election winner.United Kingdom by- election records He held the seat until the 1945 general election, when he was elected as an independent MP for the Combined English Universities.

Praedinius Gymnasium is a gymnasium in Groningen, the Netherlands. It dates back to the fourteenth century and is the larger of two non-comprehensive gymnasia in Groningen, the other being Willem Lodewijk Gymnasium. History Fourteenth century records show that an early predecessor of the Praedinius Gymnasium, the Schole tho Sunte Meerten, was situated at the current location of the Provinciehuis (Province Hall). Gradually, the school grew and attracted students from the Netherlands and abroad, and the name was changed to Latijnse school (Latin school). In 1595, when Ubbo Emmius was rector, the school moved to the old Minderbroederklooster. Later, in 1847, the Latijnse school became a gymnasium, and the name was changed to Stedelijk Gymnasium. Fourteen years later, the school moved to a new building, at the location of the current Harmonie. In 1865, the location was changed to the Martinikerkhof. On 1 September 1882, the school moved for the last time, to a new building at the Turfsingel. In 1947, on the school's first centenary, the school was named after rector Regnerus Praedinius, and the name became Praedinius Gymnasium. In 1999, due to a lack of space, a second building, the old industrial school, was added to the Praedinius.

While officially designated as an urban-type settlement, Dubove's character and composition more closely resembles that of a village. Population: . History Dubove's old Jewish cemetery. Prior to World War II, the village had a sizable Jewish community. The area once known as Subcarpathia, which includes present-day Dubove (originally settled as Dombo), was part of the Kingdom of Hungary from the 10th century until 1919. Located in the county of Máramaros, Dombo gained prominence in 1755 when it became the site of the district's forestry office, which drew skilled lumberjacks and their families from Bohemia. Following the end of World War I in 1919, Subcarpathia, including Dombo, was annexed by the newly created Czechoslovak Republic and was given its current name, Dubove, a derivative of the Slavic word for oak tree (дуб). During World War II, Dubove was occupied by pro-Nazi Hungary. In 1930, 706 (or nearly 16%) of Dubove's 4,416 inhabitants were Jewish. But by the end of World War II, virtually all of the Jews had been exterminated. The Red Army occupied Dubove in 1945 and the village was officially incorporated into the Soviet Union the following year. In 1969, Dubove became home to a major Soviet plant, the Zakarpattia Helicopter Production Enterprise, creating an influx of new settlers and eventually raising the population of the village to over 10,000. By far the largest employer in the area, the factory was responsible for funding several projects in the village, including a stadium and technical school. But after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the factory laid off roughly 5,000 workers and Dubove fell on hard times. Although the factory still creates helicopters today, most of its resources are devoted to producing commercial airplane seats, satellite antennas, and children's sleds. A Mil Mi-34 light helicopter being assembled at Dubove's Zakarpattia Helicopter Production Enterprise Geography Dubove is located approximately halfway along the path of the River Teresva.

A district is a subdivision of a mission of the church and in many ways is analogous to a stake of the church. The leader of a district is the mission president, who selects a local district president as his agent. The district president may choose two men to assist him; the three together form the district presidency. The three members of the district presidency are given the honorific title \\"President\\". Districts are usually established where the church is new or where there are insufficient numbers of church members to organize a stake. Prior to the late 1920s, districts were known as conferences. A district may be thought of as a stake in a beginning or embryonic state. Notable differences between districts and stakes A district has a function analogous to a stake, but is organized where there are too few members to organize a stake. Its relationship to a stake is similar to the relationship between a ward and a branch. Once the membership in a district achieves sufficient numbers, it may be reorganized as a stake. Districts differ from stakes in the following ways: *A district does not have its own patriarch. Members are assigned to the nearest stake patriarch. *Districts do not have a High Priests Quorum. The High Priests Quorum is a stake organization. Men residing in a district may not be ordained to the priesthood office of high priest. *Districts are composed of branches only and cannot have wards, regardless of the size of the branches. *The presiding authority in a district is the mission president; members of the mission presidency conduct temple recommend, patriarchal blessing, Melchizedek priesthood ordination, and missionary qualification interviews, not members of the district presidency. *The district presidency serves as a representative of the mission presidency since many missions have multiple districts and the mission presidency may live a great distance from the district itself. *In many very small and remote districts, some male missionaries serve as branch presidents or in other leadership positions at the local and district levels. Such arrangements may also be made in branches of stakes, but it is more common in districts. Minimum requirements and creation There is no minimum number of members or branches needed to create a district. A mission president can propose the creation of a district by lodging an application to the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Conversion to a stake For a district to become a stake, the following requirements must be met:LDS Church, Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2010) § 9.1. *a minimum number of members. In the United States and Canada, the number is 3000. Outside of the United States and Canada, the number is 1900. *at least five congregations which can function as wards. Each ward requires at least 15 active, full-tithe-paying Melchizedek priesthood holders. Wards should have at least 300 members in the United States and Canada; elsewhere, they must have at least 150 members. *an additional 24 active, full-tithe-paying Melchizedek priesthood holders in the stake boundaries. Temple district The LDS Church also uses a geographical division called a temple district. A temple district is a geographical area that is assigned to a church temple. Members residing in a temple district are asked to attend the temple that defines the district. Members may attend any of the church's temples, but temple districts are designed to help members determine what temple is closest to where they reside. A temple district is defined by a list of stakes and districts.
