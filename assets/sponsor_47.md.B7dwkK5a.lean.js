Netflix released the season in its entirety on February 27, 2015. The season was filmed from approximately June 12 through December 20, 2014. The season was recognized with numerous award nominations. Kevin Spacey won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series at the 22nd Screen Actors Guild Awards for his portrayal of Frank Underwood and Reg E. Cathey won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series at the 67th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards for his portrayal of Freddy Hayes. Production On February 4, 2014, Netflix announced it had renewed House of Cards for a third season of undisclosed length. On December 1, 2014, Netflix announced that the third season would be available on February 27, 2015. On February 11, 2015, 10 episodes from the third season became accidentally available on Netflix for approximately 25 minutes due to \\"a bug in the system\\"; however, they were quickly removed. Filming In February 2014, Kevin Spacey stated that the show would again film in the Baltimore metropolitan area. On July 3, the show was denied filming access to the Security Council chamber at the Headquarters of the United Nations by Russia through its representative Mikael Agasandyan despite encouragement from Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki- Moon. Russia questioned the propriety of filming in the chambers and felt that the room should be kept available for normal uses. For a third consecutive season, the show filmed episodes at the offices of The Baltimore Sun, which in prior seasons served as the setting for the fictional Washington Herald. Among the municipalities filmed in for the season were Havre de Grace, Maryland, and Aberdeen, Maryland. On August 9, filming of a fictional motorcade at the National Mall caused road closures on Pennsylvania Avenue, Constitution Avenue and Independence Avenue. On October 6, filming occurred at DAR Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. Other D.C. filming occurred at George Washington University and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial. The season finale was planned to be filmed in Northern New Mexico areas in and around Santa Fe and Las Vegas, New Mexico in December 2014. On December 20, 2014, creator Beau Willimon tweeted that principal photography for the season had completed that day. =Tax incentives= Netflix, which had received $26 million in tax benefits for the first two seasons was only offered a $4 million incentive for season 3 by Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, which resulted in Netflix delaying production and threatening to move production. By March 2014, it was clear that the requested state tax incentives would not be approved by the Maryland Legislature. In response to Netflix's threat to move production if \\"sufficient tax incentives\\" were not provided, the Maryland House of Delegates threatened to use eminent domain power to purchase, condemn, or seize the production assets, equipment, and other property that remained in the state because the production had already been the beneficiary of tens of millions of dollars in tax benefits. By April 6, 2014, the Maryland General Assembly considered various methods to avail the tax incentives. However, the April 7 state budget only included a total of $15 million in tax incentives for filming, leaving a $3.5 million shortfall for House of Cards, which production company Media Rights Capital said might force them to move production. Baltimore Sun longtime television critic David Zurawik felt that the $3.5 million would not keep House of Cards from returning to resume production in the area. As of April 11, some predicted that no matter what happened the season 3 release date would be delayed. On April 25, a deal was reached to leave the 2015 fiscal year budget with the $3.5 million shortfall, but to allow the producers to collect the $11.5 million unallocated filming credit that remained in the 2014 fiscal year budget. Casting On May 19, 2014, a May 19-21 casting call was posted in the Baltimore Sun for an NSA Director as well as senators, reporters, military colonels, emergency room doctors and a few other roles with projected shooting availability: June 12 – July 15, 2014. On June 3, 2014, an announcement for a June 7 casting call for extras and day players was made. In August 2014, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina of the punk band Pussy Riot were confirmed to be in the cast for season 3. In October 2014, two recurring roles were cast; Kim Dickens in an unspecified role, and Jenna Stern as an ambassador at the United Nations.

Long admired for its striking appearance and perfect proportions, it is now part of the British Museum's collection.British Museum HighlightsBritish Museum Collection It was looted from Roman Egypt in 24 BC by the forces of queen Amanirenas of Kush and brought back to Meroe, where it was buried beneath the staircase of a temple. Discovery and excavation The head was excavated by the British archaeologist John Garstang in December 1910 at Meroë, which had been the capital of the Kingdom of Kush for several centuries. It was found near a mound under what was once a temple staircase. This was a tremendous find, considering the distance between the Sudan and Rome. The statue had been purposely buried over 1900 years ago, and was well preserved due to the hot, dry conditions. His excavation report states, “Just outside the doorway of this chamber, and buried in a clean pocket of sand [two and a half meters from the surface] there was a Roman bronze portrait head of heroic size.” Garstang was eager to share his findings with the world, so he shipped it off to London as soon as possible. The bust was donated to the British Museum by the Sudan Excavation Committee with the support of the National Art Collections Fund in 1911.Image and portraiture of Augustus, the Meroë Head , CityLit.ac.uk, retrieved 21 July 2014 The excavation covered the entire lost city of Meroë. It took two excavations of the area to come across the head. Among other structures, the excavation team uncovered the ruins of a temple of Ammon, the ornately decorated temple in which the head was buried, and two large buildings speculated to be palaces. This large undertaking was financed by the Sudan Excavation Committee, composed of the National Museum of Scotland, the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, and the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium. According to Thorston Opper's The Meroë Head of Augustus (Objects in Focus), the “committee was an international consortium of museum professionals, academics and wealthy individuals, united by a desire to partake in the thrill of archaeological adventure and a share in the prospective finds.” However, most of the excavation's sponsorship came from a wealthy group of Britons (including pharmaceutics entrepreneur Henry Solomon Wellcome) and one avid German collector and scholar - Baron von Bissingen.  Identification = Initial reactions  As soon as the excavators unearthed the head, they immediately knew of its classical Roman origin and speculated that it was from the time of Augustus. Garstang was a specialist in Middle Eastern and Egyptian art, so he conferred with colleagues in Liverpool via mail, and falsely concluded that it depicted Germanicus, Augustus' great-nephew.  Professor Studniczka  The head was first offered for publication to the expert German Professor Franz Studniczka. He, along with the curators at the British Museum in London, proposed that the head portrayed Augustus himself. When compared with the Prima Porta, there was no doubt it was Augustus' head depicted by the portrait. Origins= Kushite raids  The head had clearly been hacked off a large statue made in honour of the Roman Emperor Augustus. The Greek historian Strabo mentions in his chronicles that numerous towns in Lower Egypt were adorned with statues of Augustus before an invading Kushite army looted many of them in 24 BC, when Roman forces were away fighting in the Arabian campaign. Romans used statues to remind the empire's largely illiterate population of the emperor's power. Although the Roman military under Petronius successfully invaded Kushite territory and reclaimed many statues, they were unable to reach as far south as the Kushite capital itself. The sculpture was buried beneath a monumental stairway that led to an altar of victory. The placing of the Emperor's head below the shrine's steps was designed to symbolically denigrate the reputation of Augustus in the eyes of the Meroitic aristocracy and Kushite queen Amanirenas.\\"Episode 35: Head of Augustus\\", A History of the World, BBC Radio 4. Episode Transcript. Retrieved 21 July 2014.  Other theories  There are several other theories regarding the origins of the Meroë Head. One suggested scenario states that the statue from which the head originates was given to the Meroites as a gift from Gallus. This, however, is quite unlikely because Gallus was more keen to place portraiture of himself in Egypt rather than that of Augustus. A second scenario states that the head once belonged to a statue located in the Roman fort, Qasr Ibrim. A specific podium in the fort has been pointed out as the potential spot where the statue once stood. This theory has since been disproved due to radio carbon dating and architectural grounds suggesting the podium is from the Ptolemaic period. Design Portrait's Striking Eyes The Meroë Head is larger than life-size and mimics Greek art by portraying Augustus with classical proportions; it was clearly designed to idealize and flatter the Emperor. This was the case for most Augustan portraiture, especially the earliest, which evoked both youthfulness and the long-admired Grecian techniques of depicting young men. Made of bronze, the eyes are inset with glass pupils and calcite irises. It is the preservation of the eyes (which are frequently lost in ancient bronze statues) which makes this statue so startlingly realistic. The emperor's head turns to his right and gazes powerfully into the distance. His hair falls onto his brow in waves that are typical of Augustus's portraits. The British Museum has several other notable bronze heads of Roman Emperors including an image of Claudius. The heads are thought to have been made locally but based on moulds created in Rome.

Craig served three nine-year terms there, serving as Chief Justice four times.The Life and Times of Florence Kelley in Chicago-Alfred M. Craig Biography Alfred M. Craig was born on January 15, 1832, in Paris, Illinois, the son of David and Mintie Craig. Craig attended public schools and attended Knox College, graduating in 1853. He moved to Lewistown and studied law under Hezekiah H. Weed and William C. Goudy. Craig was admitted to the bar in 1855 and moved to Knoxville to form the law firm of Manning, Douglas & Craig. In 1864, Craig was elected Knox County judge. He formed a new practice with his brother-in-law C. K. Harvey in 1868. Craig represented Knoxville in the unsuccessful legal battle to remain the county seat of Knox County. He lost an election to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1868 and an election to the Illinois Senate two years later. As one of the foremost judges in the area affiliated with the Democratic Party, Craig was nominated to challenge Republican Justice Charles B. Lawrence for a seat on the Illinois Supreme Court in 1873. Craig's bid was successful. He was re-elected in 1882, defeating John Davis McCulloch, then again in 1891, defeating Henry W. Wells. Craig was named Chief Justice, then a one-year position, in 1878, 1881, 1888, and 1895. He wrote the opinion of Illinois Central Railroad v. Illinois, a case later taken up by the Supreme Court of the United States. Craig was often coveted for political candidacy, but he refused all offers. Grover Cleveland considered Craig to fill the Chief Justice vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States, but he instead elected to name Melville Fuller. Outside of his law interests, Craig also had large landholdings. He was the president of the Banks of Galesburg and the Bank of Altoona, and was a director of the First National Bank of Knoxville.

It is a tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna River and is long. There are a number of coal seams in the Birch Island Run watershed, as well as iron ore. Mining has been done in the watershed. The watershed is 15.3 square miles in area and is almost entirely forested. The stream's tributaries include Little Birch Island Run and Amos Branch. Parts of the watershed are affected by acid mine drainage. However, brook trout live in the stream. Course Birch Island Run starts in Grove Township, in Cameron County. It flows a short distance southeast before exiting Cameron County and entering Clinton County. In Clinton County, the stream enters West Keating Township and continues southeast through Sproul State Forest. It picks up the tributary Amos Branch near the central part of West Keating Township. As the stream continues southeast, its valley gets progressively deeper. It flows past several strip mines and picks up Little Birch Island Run within of its mouth. Birch Island Run empties into the West Branch Susquehanna River at the border between Clinton County and Centre County, near a Conrail railroad. Tributaries Named tributaries of Birch Island Run include Amos Branch and Little Birch Island Run. There are also a number of unnamed tributaries to the stream. Hydrology The daily load of manganese in Birch Island Run is at the site BIR01, which is located at the confluence of Little Birch Island Run with Birch Island Run and at the site BIR02, which is located near the stream's mouth. The load of acidity is per day at BIR01, per day at BIR02, and per day at site BIR03, which is located at the confluence of Amos Branch with Birch Island Run. The concentration of sulfates is below 20 milligrams per liter in the upper reaches of Birch Island Run. However, an unnamed stream that experiences acid mine drainage and is a tributary of Little Birch Island Run has a sulfate concentration of 255 milligrams per liter. The pH of this unnamed tributary ranges from 3.9 to 4.2. At the mouth of Little Birch Island Run, the sulfate concentration is 40 milligrams per liter and the concentration at the mouth of Birch Island Run is 25 milligrams per liter. On Little Birch Island Run, at site LBIR01, which is located near its mouth, the daily load of aluminum is and the daily load of manganese is . The daily load of acidity is at LBIR01 and at site LBIR02. The discharge of Birch Island Run at its confluence with Amos Branch is 1548 gallons per minute. The discharge is 5881.43 gallons per minute at its confluence with Little Birch Island Run. At the mouth of Birch Island Run, the discharge is gallons per minute. At the confluence of Amos Run with Birch Island Run, the latter stream's pH ranged from 4.9 to 6.2 in 2002, with an average of 5.3. At the confluence of Little Birch Island Run with Birch Island Run, the latter stream's pH ranged from 4.7 to 5.7, with an average of 5.1. At the stream's mouth, the pH ranged from 4.8 to 5.5, with an average of 5.1. In the upper reaches of Birch Island Run, the pH is naturally low, as opposed to being low due to acid mine drainage. The alkalinity level of the upper parts of the stream is low. There are two sources of acid mine drainage in the Birch Island Run watershed. Both discharge into Little Birch Island Run within of its mouth. Watershed The Birch Island Run watershed is largely in southwestern Clinton County. However, a small area is in southeastern Cameron County. Most of the watershed is forested and far from development. In specific, 95% of the watershed's land is forested. There are some unused mines in the watershed, and some residential areas along Keating Road. There are also camps in the area. The Birch Island Run watershed has a total area of 15.3 square miles. Out of these, 6.6 square miles are in the watershed of Little Birch Island Run. The tributary Amos Branch has an area of 2.3 square miles. State Forests occupy most of the northern part of the Birch Island Run watershed. State Game Lands occupy some of the southern part of the watershed. Abandoned mining lands are mostly located in the southern and eastern areas of the watershed. Geography and geology The headwaters of Birch Island Run are at an elevation of . The mouth is at an elevation of . The stream is located in the Appalachian Plateau. The watershed is located in the Snow Shoe Northwest USGS quadrant map. Several coal seams are located in the Birch Island Run watershed. They are known as the Lower Kittanning, the Middle Kittanning, and the Upper Kittanning. Most of the rocks in the watershed are from Pennsylvanian or Mississippian times. Rocks from the Mississippian epoch include the Huntley Mountain Formation and the Burgoon Sandstone. Rocks from the Pennsylvanian epoch include the Pottsville Formation and the Allegheny Formation. Iron ore is also found in the watershed. The Clearfield-McIntyre syncline is in the Birch Island Run watershed. It runs in a northeast to southwest direction, passing the confluence of Little Birch Island Run with Birch Island Run. The Chestnut Ridge-Wellsboro anticline runs near the headwaters of Birch Island Run. History In 1835, Samuel Grove visited the Birch Island Run watershed for a number of weeks. He searched unsuccessfully for silver in the area. Parts of the Birch Island Run watershed have been mined. A number of permits for surface mining have been issued. However, there has been no mining in the watershed since the 1980s. The TMDL for the stream was publicly discussed in Clearfield on July 14, 2004. In 2010, a 135-acre tract of grassland partially in the Little Birch Island Run watershed was created as an elk habitat. Biology There are brook trout living in some streams in the Birch Island Run watershed, including Birch Island Run itself. In 1915, a total of 1000 brook trout were observed in the stream. All of the streams in the watershed are considered high-quality coldwater fisheries. Almost all of the fish species in the watershed are brook trout. However, a number of scuplins have been found in the lower reaches of the stream. A smallmouth bass was also once observed near the stream's mouth.

The original school building covered 5 acres. In 1966, several rooms were added, including a library and a band room. A wing dedicated to orthopedics was completed in 1981. Buck Lodge Middle School changed from a junior high school to a middle school in 1981. From 1991 to 1992, the school was completely renovated and remodeled, with students returning to the newly-refurbished school in September 1992. On February 4, 2014, U.S. President Barack H.

Etymology  Buck Lodge Middle School derives its name from the 250-acre Buck Lodge, which was given by King George I of Great Britain to Arthur Nelson in 1717. The lodge was later given to Benjamin Belt, who, in 1746, sold it to Thomas Owens of Great Britain, who then lost possession of it to Count Demanu. The lodge later came under possession of the Pywell family, who kept it until the Maryland state government purchased it. In 1956, the Prince George's County Board of Education acquired the land.

History The building that is now known as the Westcott Theater was first constructed in 1919. Formerly called the Harvard Theater and then the Studio, the theater originally acted as a cinema hosting a variety of films ranging from vaudeville films to more risque adult films. In 1993 Nat Tobin, local film enthusiast and manager of the Manlius Art Cinema, took control of the cinema's lease and re-opened the property now calling it the Westcott Cinema. Under Tobin the single-screen cinema screened contemporary films for 14 years before having to close down in October 2007. Interested in appropriating the now defunct cinema, local entrepreneurs Sam Levey and Dan Mastronardi approached building owner Ray Duplain with an offer. After renovating the former cinema, tearing out the old seats and screen and installing a small bar, the Westcott Theater opened for business. The venue began hosting shows in September 2008, although its official opening was not held until November of the same year. The Post Standard's Chris Baker said in 2013 that “the [Westcott] theater has become the most consistent midsize venue in [Syracuse] with about 120 shows annually.”  Concerts  In Syracuse the Westcott Theater performed two concerts by moe.

The type and only species is M. forcipata, described in 2013. Discovery Miriholcorpa was discovered in the Jiulongshan Formation at Daohugou Village of Ningcheng County in Inner Mongolia, China. The fossil is late Middle Jurassic in age, from the Callovian–Bathonian boundary (c. 165 million years ago). The genus name derives from the Latin miri meaning amazing, in reference to the high-quality preservation, and Holcorpa, the type genus of the extinct Mecopteran family Holcorpidae, to which Miriholcorpa shows similarities. The specific epithet forcipata, is Latin for pincer-like, in reference to the pincer-like structures on the genitalia. Description Illustration of genital structures. Scale bar: 1 mm (.04 in) The holotype is 32.7 mm from head to the tip of the genital bulb. The left forewing, abdominal segments and genitalia are well preserved, while the venation of both hind wings are only partially preserved. The compound eyes are large and oval-shaped. The antennae are filliform. The genital bulb is enlarged with pincer-like structures, a feature hypothesized to be used in intrasexual competition with males, and/or a sexual display to females. Classification The forewing anatomy of Miriholcorpa bears similarities to members of the Holcorpidae, yet the venation of the hindwings are not fully preserved, and cannot be used to definitively assign it to the family. As such, the describers placed Miriholcorpa as incertae sedis (uncertain placement) within Mecoptera pending further discoveries. Miriholcorpa was described along with another Mecopteran, Fortiholcorpa paradoxa, also unassigned to any family.

A coaching veteran of 26 years, Woods has previously served as an assistant coach for the San Francisco 49ers, Denver Broncos, Oakland Raiders, Minnesota Vikings and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. During his NFL coaching career, Woods has coached seven players to 13 total Pro Bowl selections. College career Woods lettered four times as a cornerback and safety during his collegiate career at Illinois State University, graduating from the school in 1992 with a degree in criminal justice. He was team captain as a senior in 1991 and went on to earn first-team All-Gateway Conference honors following his final season. Coaching career=Early years Woods began his coaching career as a defensive backs coach at Muskingum College in 1992 and moved on to become a graduate assistant coach at Eastern Michigan University in 1993. Woods also served as defensive backs coach at Kent State University (1997) and Grand Valley State University (1994-96) following a stint coaching linebackers during the spring of 1994 at Northwestern State University. He coached the same position with Hofstra University from 1998-2000, helping the school make consecutive trips to the 1-AA playoff quarterfinals. Woods then became the defensive backs coach for three seasons (2001-03) at Western Michigan University. NFLTampa Bay Buccaneers= In 2004, Woods was hired by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as the defensive backs coach. During his first two seasons with Tampa Bay, Woods coached a talented secondary led by cornerbacks Ronde Barber and Brian Kelly. Barber, an NFL 2000s All-Decade performer, earned first-team All-Pro recognition from the Associated Press following each of his two seasons playing for Woods. =Minnesota Vikings= Woods was brought to Minnesota in 2006 along with Defensive Coordinator Mike Tomlin, who worked with him as a secondary coach in Tampa Bay. Woods spent eight seasons coaching defensive backs in Minnesota. The Vikings finished among the NFL’s top 10 defenses in four of his first five years with the team, capturing back-to-back NFC North Division titles from 2008-09 and making an NFC Championship Game appearance following the 2009 season. =Oakland Raiders= Woods coached the Raiders’ defensive backs in 2014, working with veteran safety Charles Woodson, who led the team with 160 tackles (105 solo) and four interceptions in his 17th NFL season. =Denver Broncos= In Woods’ first season coaching the Broncos’ secondary in 2015, Denver finished first in the NFL against the pass (199.6 ypg) while the defensive backfield accounted for 11 interceptions, 56 passes defensed, nine forced fumbles and four touchdowns. The Broncos posted three interceptions against just one passing touchdown allowed during Denver’s postseason run that ended with a victory in Super Bowl 50. In 2016, the Broncos’ secondary held opponents to the fewest yards per game (185.8), yards per attempt (5.8) and passing touchdowns (13) in the NFL. After the departure of defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, Woods was chosen to be promoted to defensive coordinator for the 2017 season. Denver finished first in the NFL in pass defense in both 2015 (199.6 ypg) and 2016 (185.8) with Woods coaching the team’s defensive backs. All four of Denver’s starting defensive backs made at least one Pro Bowl playing for Woods from 2015-16, including cornerbacks Chris Harris Jr. (2015-16) and Aqib Talib (2015-16), who were also named first-team All-Pro selections by the Associated Press in 2016. Safeties T.J. Ward (2015) and Darian Stewart (2016) also earned Pro Bowl recognitions while playing for Woods. In Woods’ first season as defensive coordinator in 2017, the Broncos finished third in the NFL in total defense, giving up just 290.0 yards per game. The Broncos’ fifth-ranked run defense in 2017 was particularly impressive as it improved by more than 40 yards per game after finishing 28th in the NFL in 2016. =San Francisco 49ers= In January 2019, the San Francisco 49ers hired Joe Woods as defensive back coach and passing game coordinator. =Cleveland Browns= On February 7, 2020, Woods was hired by the Cleveland Browns as their defensive coordinator under head coach Kevin Stefanski.

In 1954 Roy Keller bought the business from Mary Duerst Hemming, who owned and operated Mary's as a piano bar beginning in the 1930s. Keller initially hired go-go dancers as entertainment during the piano player's breaks, later hiring them full-time because of their popularity. Topless dancers wearing pasties were introduced in 1955. The club also featured comics, musicians, singers and other acts. All-nude dancing began in 1985, after a judicial ruling against City of Portland ordinances banning it in venues which served alcohol. Former strippers include Courtney Love and Christine Jorgensen, although the club is known for its longtime dancers who are loyal to the family business. Since Keller's death in 2006, Mary's Club has been owned and operated by his daughter Vicki. A Portland institution, it has been included in several strip-club \\"best of\\" lists and its neon sign is considered a landmark. The club has appeared in several films, including Bongwater (1997) and Brainsmasher... A Love Story (1993), and has been included in walking tours of the city. History Mary's Club, known as \\"Portland's first topless\\", is the oldest strip club in Portland. Portland shipyard foreman Roy Keller bought the club in 1954 for about $25,000 from Mary Duerst Hemming, who was awarded the piano bar (which was popular with sailors) in a divorce settlement and operated the business \\"for more than 20 years\\" beginning in the 1930s. According to The Seattle Times, Keller initially hired go-go dancers to entertain the crowd during the piano player's breaks. Due to the dancers' popularity, Keller hired them full-time, laid off the piano player and introduced \\"pasties-clad topless dancers\\" in 1955. That year, two city-council members advised Keller not to install pinball machines at the club since Portland then had an anti-pinball ordinance which was being contested in court. A Mary's Club team played in the Multnomah League of the Portland Basketball Association during the 1955-56 season with teams sponsored by Interstate Hauling, Kent's Keg, Il Trovatore, Frolic Inn, and the Portland Air Base, among others. Marquee in 2014 Singers, comics, and piano players performed at the club. A 1958 newspaper advertisement announced its opening act as Tiny Watson, \\"200 pounds of mirth and merriment\\", and compared her to Sophie Tucker. The closing performer was George James, \\"King of the Keyboards\\". In 1965, an Oregonian article featured topless dancer Bambi Darling, who performed at Mary's Club; she reportedly excelled in discothèque, \\"shaking and undulating\\" to the Mashed Potato, the Monkey, the Shotgun, and other dances popular at the time. Keller, said to resemble \\"a church deacon\\", praised his dancers and described his customer base as \\"more refined\\" than that of the club's pre-1954 era. By March 1966, Darling's \\"16 torrid acts\\" shared the bill with reptile-wrestler Bobby Vale and Gigi La France, promoted as the club's answer to James Bond. Tom Waits reportedly sang about the club in \\"Pasties and a G-String\\" from his album, Small Change (1976). In 2012, an author wrote that Mary's Club featured \\"tattooed contortionist entertainers\\". Nude dancing at the club began in 1985 after a judge overturned City of Portland ordinances banning it at venues which served alcohol. A lawsuit over pasties and G-strings was brought after Portland annexed land formerly regulated by Multnomah County, which allowed tavern dancers to perform without clothing. A bar forced by the annexation to eliminate its nude dancing successfully sued the city. \\"As soon as we got the word [about the ruling], we went nude,\\" said a club employee who was quoted in The Oregonian. Courtney Love (pictured in 1995) performed at the club. According to Willamette Week, Courtney Love (whose autographed picture hangs on a club wall) is a former Mary's Club stripper. Love wrote on the photograph that she \\"bought my very first guitar here showing my teeny little titties\\". Although Christine Jorgensen was also featured at the club, dancers tend to be longtime employees loyal to the family-run business. Keller died in 2006 at age 90; Mary's Club is now run by his daughter, Vicki, who remembered that she first worked there as a seven-year-old waitress. Vicki managed the business for twenty-five years before her father's death, and her daughters worked at the club during that period. According to a 2013 Portland Monthly profile, Mary's Club has a full cocktail bar, more than two dozen varieties of beer and wine, and a menu featuring Mexican cuisine. The club has a one-drink minimum and a small cover charge on Friday and Saturday evenings. Murals and marquee Between 1956 and 1958, Keller hired La Monte Montyne to paint murals throughout the club's interior. The fluorescent murals depict scenes which Roy thought patrons would appreciate. Several feature women in exotic locales, such as the Orient and the Pyramids; one depicts an \\"island beauty\\" watching sailors load bananas onto a ship, and another shows merchant seamen working in front of a ship docked in a \\"Portland-like\\" harbor. The mural at the Pyramids depicts a lounging Cleopatraesque woman, and another features an \\"exotic priestess\\" making a sacrifice at a volcano. According to Mary's, the murals receive \\"almost as much attention as the girls do!\\" Mary's \\"retro\\" neon marquee has been called a \\"landmark for locals and tourists alike\\". In 2014, a Willamette Week contributor said about the signage: \\"The marquee, blue and star-spangled and coyly advertising an evening of 'Dine and Dance', is as iconic as the neon on the 'Made in Oregon' sign and the line outside Voodoo\\". The club's cocktail-waitress logo is featured on clothing, and its marquee also includes an epitaph to Keller. Reception Entrance sign in 2014 Mary's Club has been called a \\"downtown institution\\" and a \\"Portland nightlife landmark\\". In 2001, The Portland Mercury called the club \\"a must-visit for any true strip club connoisseur\\" for offering \\"friendliness and sexiness\\". A reporter found the interior \\"cozy\\", with conversational dancers who seemed to enjoy their interaction with guests. After Keller's death, Willamette Week said that the club \\"has cemented its place in history far beyond the city limits\\" for featuring Love and Jorgensen and offering nudity to a loyal customer base. The newspaper's Mary Christmas wrote that Keller had become a \\"regional celebrity\\" and could be credited with beginning a local industry. In 2011, a contributor to the Daily Vanguard (Portland State University's student newspaper) included Mary's on his list of the city's top five strip clubs: \\"If you visit only one dance club in this town it should probably be Mary’s. The inside is stuffy and sleazy, but embodies that red-light district feel that fits right in with [the] rowdy environment.\\" That year, Willamette Week called the club \\"the undisputed grande dame of West Coast strips\\" and \\"a stubbornly degenerate landmark\\". According to the newspaper's Matthew Korfhage, its entertainment came in the form of \\"girls/ladies, friendly also brassy, oddly classy, with sterling taste on the juke, who let you see all of their piercings and tattoos. Also, video poker\\". In 2013, Portland Monthly made Mary's Club an \\"editor's pick\\" for its dancers, its all-female staff, and its \\"welcoming and relaxed\\" environment. Thrillist.com included Mary's in its \\"definitive guide\\" to Portland's best strip clubs, complimenting its \\"glorious flashing sign that welcomes you to Downtown\\" and calling the club \\"a part of Portland's past we should all cherish\\". Men's Fitness included Mary's on its list of the \\"Top 10 Best Strip Clubs in America\\", calling it a \\"neon landmark\\" with blacklight murals and a \\"relaxed, hole-in-the-wall vibe\\". Thomas Lauderdale, known for his work with the Portland-based band Pink Martini, has shared his fondness for the club and considers it one of his favorite places in the city. Portland Monthly published a video of Lauderdale giving a tour of the club. Lauderdale interviews Vicki Keller and shows the interior murals. He sometimes wears a Pink Martini bomber-style jacket inspired by one sold by the business in the 1950s. Films including scenes shot at Mary's include Bongwater (1997), Brainsmasher... A Love Story (1993) and Dangerous Pursuit (1990). The club has been included in walking tours of Portland, including Lonely Planet's \\"Underground Portland\\". Mary's Club was the last stop on the 2013 \\"Seedy, Seamy and Sinful Portland\\" history tour, which took adult visitors to Old Town Chinatown sites to examine the city's \\"darker elements\\". Led by a historian, the tour included saloons, opium dens, gambling halls, and bordellos which operated in the city. It was repeated in the historian's 2014 tour, \\"Shanghaiers, Saloons and Skullduggery: A Walking Tour of Portland's Sinful Past\\".

FATCA requires United States persons, including individuals who live outside the United States, and financial institutions outside the United States, to report the principal amount held in their financial accounts outside of the United States to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). According to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) there are about one million American citizens living in Canada.

The agreement exempts Tax-Free Savings Accounts, Registered Disability Savings Plans and Registered Education Savings Plans. Canadian banks say they expect compliance costs to be \\"enormous\\". According to Bloomberg, Revenue Canada minister Kerry- Lynne Findlay promised that this treaty will not impose any U.S. taxes or penalties on people holding accounts in Canada.

CTV January 2014 report In January 2014 CTV Television Network reported that Allison Christians, the H. Howard Stikeman Chair in Tax Law at McGill University, said that the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act could impact all Canadians. \\"The way the U.S. law is written, financial institutions around the world have an obligation to ensure that any accounts that are held by American people with U.S. status, that information about that account is given to IRS....\\" Allison Christians collaborated with Queens University professor Arthur Cockfield on another paper on this topic.Christians, Allison and Cockfield, Arthur J., Submission to Finance Department on Implementation of FATCA in Canada (March 10, 2014). FATCA requires Canadian banks to identify and supply the financial information of anyone considered to be a U.S. person to the IRS. FATCA may affect Canadians with no ties to the U.S. Christians says that financial institutions face high costs to implement the new rules, and that all customers will face higher banking costs typically passed on to clients in the form of higher fees and charges. Financial Post March 2014 report On March 26, 2014 Julius Melnitzer wrote in the Financial Post that FATCA requires foreign financial institutions to report the financial activities of their American clients to the Internal Revenue Service and to withhold funds in appropriate circumstances. However the Isaac Brock Society leaked documents from CRA's guidance notes that suggest that the Canadian federal government and Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) have undermined the intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the U.S. which is aimed at catching American tax evaders living in Canada. It is alleged that Finance Canada and CRA \\"intended to drastically depart\\" from key definitions found in the IGA and FATCA, and that CRA's interpretation of the draft legislation is \\"significantly different\\" from OECD guidance. For instance, CRA's guidance suggests that a place of birth is only unambiguous if an account holder lists it as \\"New York, New York, USA\\" but not if it is listed as \\"New York, New York.\\" Litigation Two American-Canadian dual citizens living in Canada, Virginia Hillis and Gwendolyn Louise Deegan, sued the Canadian government (specifically the Attorney General of Canada and the Minister of National Revenue) in 2014 in the Federal Court of Canada, claiming (among other things) that the intergovernmental U.S.-Canadian agreement that implements FATCA violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, particularly the provisions related to discrimination on the basis of citizenship or national origin. The suit was prepared by a group called the Alliance for the Defence of Canadian Sovereignty (ADCS). In 2015, the Federal Court of Canada dismissed the suit, upholding the intergovernmental agreement. The Federal Court also rejected the claims in 2019, although a further appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal may follow.

First predicted by theory in the mid-1990s, different borophene structures were experimentally confirmed in 2015.  Properties  Experimentally various atomically-thin, crystalline and metallic borophenes were synthesized on clean metal surfaces under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions. Their atomic structure consists of mixed triangular and hexagonal motifs, such as shown in Figure 1. The atomic structure is a consequence of an interplay between two-center and multi-center in-plane bonding, which is typical for electron deficient elements like boron. Borophenes exhibit in-plane elasticity and ideal strength. They can be stronger than graphene, and more flexible, in some configurations. For example, boron nanotubes have a higher 2D Young's modulus than any other known carbon and noncarbon nanostructures. Borophenes undergo novel structural phase transition under in-plane tensile loading due to the fluxional nature of their multi-center in-plane bonding. Borophene has potential as an anode material for batteries due to high theoretical specific capacities, electronic conductivity and ion transport properties. Hydrogen easily adsorbs to borophene, offers potential for hydrogen storage – over 15% of its weight. Borophene can catalyze the breakdown of molecular hydrogen into hydrogen ions, and reduce water.  History  Figure 2: A cluster might be seen as smallest borophene; front and side view Computational studies by I. Boustani and A. Quandt showed that small boron clusters do not adopt icosahedral geometries like boranes, instead they turn out to be quasi-planar (see Figure 2). This led to the discovery of a so-called Aufbau principle that predicts the possibility of borophene (boron sheets), boron fullerenes (borospherene) and boron nanotubes. Additional studies showed that extended, triangular borophene (Figure 1(c)) is metallic and adopts a non-planar, buckled geometry. Further computational studies, initiated by the prediction of a stable B80 boron fullerene, suggested that extended borophene sheets with honeycomb structure and with partially filled hexagonal holes are stable. These borophene structures were predicted to be metallic. The so-called γ sheet (a.k.a. β12 borophene or υ1/6 sheet) is shown in Figure 1(a). The planarity of boron clusters was first experimentally confirmed by the research team of L.-S. Wang. Later they showed that the structure of (see Figure 2) is the smallest boron cluster to have sixfold symmetry and a perfect hexagonal vacancy, and that it can serve as a potential basis for extended two-dimensional boron sheets. After the synthesis of silicene, multiple groups predicted that borophene could potentially be realized with the support of a metal surface. In particular, the lattice structure of borophene was shown to depend on the metal surface, displaying a disconnect from that in a freestanding state. In 2015 two research teams succeeded in synthesizing different borophene phases on silver (111) surfaces under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions. Among the three borophene phases synthesized (see Figure 1), the v1/6 sheet, or β12, was shown by an earlier theory to be the ground state on the Ag(111) surface, while the χ3 borophene was previously predicted by Zeng team in 2012. So far, borophenes exist only on substrates; how to transfer them onto a device-compatible substrate is necessary, but remains a challenge. Atomic-scale characterization, supported by theoretical calculations, revealed structures reminiscent of fused boron clusters consisting of mixed triangular and hexagonal motives, as previously predicted by theory and shown in Figure 1. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy confirmed that the borophenes are metallic. This is in contrast to bulk boron allotropes, which are semiconducting and marked by an atomic structure based on B12 icosahedra.

Career=Amateur Radio Victoreen began his career in Cleveland, Ohio as a radio and radio parts manufacturer in the early 1920s ( QSL card 8ACH ) . At age 23 he had already received the first of many patents, this one for a high frequency tuning device that could be used in systems with radio frequency amplifiers of constant frequency. He had started a radio parts business and became interested in designing and building high quality radio receivers, some of which still exist today. His Heterodyne was considered by some to be the \\"Rolls Royce\\" of radios. File:John_A._Victoreen1922.jpg Radiation Measurement His interest soon turned to radiation measurement. In 1928 he founded the Victoreen Instrument Company in Cleveland Heights, OH and began to manufacture an x-ray dosimeter invented by Hugo Fricke and Otto Glasser. The first commercial model was the Condenser-R meter, which accurately measured the intensity and total dosage of X-ray exposure, and he gained international fame for this. He also developed other radiation measurement devices and his company provided 95% of the instrumentation for the Bikini atomic tests after World War II. His company was considered to be the \\"first nuclear company\\". During World War II, Victoreen was contracted by the Manhattan Project to develop portable radiation devices as part of the highly secret Operation Peppermint project leading up to D-Day. Otology Victoreen moved to Colorado Springs in 1950 and was on the staff as a consulting physicist at the Medical Center there. His interest in audio power amplification and frequency response led him into the field of otology and otometry.Patterson, Donald (April 1986). \\"Victoreen\\". Radio Age, Volume 12 No. 4, pp. 1-3. He moved from Colorado Springs to Maitland, FL in 1962 Personal life Victoreen was born to Ernest and Anne (Austin) Victoreen in 1902. He married Francis S. Shima, and they had two children: Jacqueline Ann (later Weir) and Robert Roy. Francis died in 1968 and he was remarried to Lizzie Louise (Bush) Sturges Feb 11, 1970.

The background of the conflict is Bern's refusal to pay taxes to Habsburg, and turning to the anti-Habsburg alliance of Burgundy and Savoy for protection. Burgundy declared war on Habsburg in 1287, and Rudolf of Habsburg treated Bern as a Burgundian city, laying siege to it twice without success. The son of Rudolf of Habsubrg, duke Rudolf of Swabia moved towards Bern with 300 cavalry in April 1289 and prepared an ambush outside of the city while harassing the landscape in an attempt to draw out a sortie. The plan worked, and the Bernese were surrounded and defeated outside the gates of their city. Count Louis I of Homberg, a cousin of duke Rudolf, fought on the side of the Bernese and fell, to the consternation of the duke. In the following negotiations, Bern was forced to again accept taxes and reparation payments, but it retained its imperial immediacy and did not fall to the House of Habsburg. Within Bern, the defeat led to a political crisis, resulting in a constitution that gave more rights to the craftsmen's guilds.

It officially left early access on June 2, 2016. The game has been compared to the Syndicate and MechWarrior series. Brigador: Up-Armored Edition, was the improved relaunch released on June 2, 2017, which provided a new introduction to game mechanics, rebalanced the game's overall difficulty, added localization support, and made graphical upgrades such as better explosions and lighting changes. Gameplay Brigador is divided into two modes: Campaign and Freelance. Each mission in Campaign mode offers the player up to four different loadouts to complete a mission's objectives. The player can choose from three main objectives: eliminate a certain number of enemy NPCs, take out all the marked captains, or destroy the orbital defense platforms before making their escape. Completing a mission successfully rewards the player with money, which they can spend on unlocking in-game flavor text as well as other vehicles, weapons and pilots for use in Freelance mode. In Freelance mode, the player chooses a pilot, vehicle, weapons and a \\"run\\" of levels to complete. What the player chooses for their run will affect the difficulty of enemies faced, what factions they may encounter, as well as the payout multiplier bonus for successfully completing a run of levels. Additional, harder runs can be purchased using the currency earned within the game. Development Brigador is the first game by Stellar Jockeys. Co- founders Hugh Monahan and Jack Monahan are behind the game's art direction and design, while Dale Kim and Harry Hsiao worked as programmers on the game's custom engine. The game began development in 2011, and its development was entirely self-funded. Brigador was released in October 2015 as an early access title, with the full launch following in June 2016. Following the 2016 launch, Dale Kim and Harry Hsiao parted amicably from the studio, with Karl Parakenings joining to provide programming support in their stead. On June 2, 2017, the game was relaunched as Brigador: Up-Armored Edition which added more content to the game, rebalanced the game's difficulty, and localized the game into several languages including French, German, Russian, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and several others. Reception Brigador: Up-Armored Edition is rated \\"Overwhelmingly Positive\\" on Steam by users, while on reviews aggregation website Metacritic it has a score of 70 indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/brigador On initial release, the developers found it difficult to generate awareness for the game, which contributed to its commercial failure. However, due to the 2017 relaunch and continued support by the developers, the game saw improved sales numbers, particularly in non-English speaking territories. Sequel In May 2019, a direct sequel to Brigador, titled Brigador Killers, was announced and is expected to release in 2020.

He performed at the Newport Folk Festival in 2012. Tolchin released his first full-length album, Criminal Man, independently in 2012. He is currently signed to Yep Roc Records through which he has released two albums. Biography Immediately after Jonah Tolchin finished recording his new album, 'Thousand Mile Night,' he got behind the wheel and lived it, driving from Muscle Shoals, Alabama, all the way back to his native New Jersey with guitarist Lucas Hamren in one straight shot. By the time the car finally coasted into Hamren's driveway in the early dawn light, the odometer had accumulated 998 miles. The journey wasn't quite over yet, though. Tolchin said his goodbyes, gathered his things from the back seat, and began the walk to his childhood home on nearby Clover Lane. It was precisely two more miles. The universe is full of signs if you're open to them, and for Jonah Tolchin, there could be no clearer omen than the mileage of that epic trip: he'd had made the perfect album for the perfect moment in his life. Recorded at the legendary FAME Studios (Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin), 'Thousand Mile Night' charts the young songwriter's remarkable growth, both personally and artistically, as he digs deep into the roots of American music with a distinctly modern perspective, tackling everything from love and marriage to life on the road to loneliness and depression with a deft lyrical touch. The album follows Tolchin's acclaimed Yep Roc debut, 'Clover Lane,' which was recorded in Nashville with a slew of special guests including Los Lobos' Steve Berlin and Deer Tick's John McCauley. NPR called Tolchin \\"a promising new artist who artfully occupies the gulf between old-school tradition and contemporary appropriation,\\" while Uncut said he \\"demonstrates the finesse and maturity of someone like Jason Isbell,\\" and Mojo praised him for \\"adding raw, punk brio to a folk-blues template.\\" Tolchin racked up more than three million plays on Spotify with tracks from the record and toured the US and Europe extensively in support of it, sharing bills with artists like Chuck Prophet, Dave and Phil Alvin, Gregg Allman, Joseph Arthur, and more along the way. When he wasn't on the road, Tolchin was busy showing off his talents behind the board as a producer, heading to Nashville's Bomb Shelter to helm an album for Bill Scorzari and bringing bluesy soul singer Julie Rhodes to record at FAME, where he made such a powerful connection with engineer John Gifford III that he knew he had to return there for 'Thousand Mile Night.' When it came time to record, Tolchin doubled down on the same raw approach that made 'Clover Lane' such an infectious collection, performing live as a band in the studio and recording and mixing the entire album start-to-finish in a staggering four days. \\"I work very well under pressure,\\" Tolchin explains. \\"If I had three weeks to make a record, I don't know what would happen. There's something about having this pressure to create on a deadline that helps me as an artist. We didn't have the luxury to over-think anything.\\" Tolchin once again teamed up with producer/multi-instrumentalist Marvin Etzioni, who helped shepherd 'Clover Lane,' and rounded out the band with Hamren on guitar, Michael Bosco on drums, and Jamie McFarlane (son of legendary Muscle Shoals musician Will McFarlane) on bass. Rather than prep everyone for the whirlwind sessions, though, Tolchin kept them in the dark until it was time to press record. \\"I purposely didn’t show anyone besides Marvin the songs,\\" he explains. \\"I don’t like anyone to chart anything out in the studio. I like them to make it up as they go along. I want everyone to play what they feel is the right thing to play.\\" The result is free-wheeling and instinctual, the rare sound of a group of artists discovering the magic and mystery in the songs at the same time as they reveal themselves to the listener. It all begins with album opener \\"Beauty In The Ugliest Days,\\" a beautiful showcase of Tolchin's young-man- with-an-old-soul brand of heartfelt philosophy featuring a performance by Bob Marley drummer \\"Santa\\" Davis. It's a song of resilience, a gentle dose of Zen reassurance in the face of doubt that every dark cloud does indeed come with a silver lining. \\"I was on an airplane sitting on the runway in Los Angeles, and I got a call from Marvin,\\" remember Tolchin. \\"He had just spoken to a friend of his from school that he'd lost touch with a long time ago, and it turned out this friend had been living on the streets. He said,' Marvin, I have this title for a song called 'It's Up To You To See The Beauty In The Ugliest Of Days.' He started talking to Marvin about this concept, and then Marvin called me right away, and I'd finished writing the song before we even took off.\\" There are some ugly days on this record, to be sure, from \\"Song About Home\\"—written during an unhappy stint living on the West Coast in the Olympia apartment complex —to \\"Where The Hell Are All My Friends\\"—an apocalyptic, Tom Waits-esque musing on time spent alone—but Tolchin takes the lesson to heart and always pushes deeper to find moments of transcendence and redemption. He embraces change and uncertainty throughout the record, singing \\"All the wise men say / That they know nothing at all\\" on \\"Workin' Man Blues #22\\" and surrendering himself to the all-encompassing power of true love on \\"Completely,\\" which features Joaquin Cooder on drums. Elsewhere, \\"Unless You Got Faith\\" is an ode to trusting in your gut, \\"Hard Time Killing Floor Blues\\" resurrects the Skip James classic, and \\"I Wonder\\" is a rollicking note-to-self to accept things as they are. \\"I can get in these existential mindsets where I'll get very philosophical,\\" says Tolchin. \\"I'll want to know the answer, and I won’t want to rest until I find it. This song was a reminder that sometimes you can just wonder about something and that’s all. There doesn’t have to be an answer. The process of wondering is one of the most beautiful things about being human.\\" With an album this outstanding, we don't have to wonder much about what's in store for Jonah Tolchin. It's safe to say there will be many more thousand-mile nights in his future as he takes these songs across the country and around the world, bringing beauty and truth and silver linings wherever he goes, \\"driving all night,\\" as he sings, \\"on a little bit of faith.\\" http://www.jonahtolchin.com/about Musical career When Tolchin was fifteen, blues legend Ronnie Earl heard him play at a music store, took him out to lunch and asked Jonah to play with him onstage. Tolchin says, \\"It was a really beautiful gesture. It was amazing to have that sort of validation from such a legend. I thought, 'I guess i can do something with this.'\\" Jonah continued to play music through high school with his band Uncle Fran's Breakfast. When high school ended, he struck out on his own, forsaking college for a chance in music. In 2012, Tolchin released his first full-length album, Criminal Man, so named after the first song he ever wrote at the age of 15. The album was released independently, and received radio airplay. Soon thereafter, Tolchin was asked to play the Newport Folk Festival. Tolchin followed Criminal Man with the 5 Dollar EP, his first collaboration with record producer Marvin Etzioni. Tolchin signed with Yep Roc Records in 2014, and released his second full-length album, Clover Lane, in 2014. In August 2016 he released the album Thousand Mile Night. On November 8, 2018, Tolchin released a new single and official music video titled \\"The Grateful Song (Thanksgiving)\\", via Yep Roc Records. The video premiered on The Bluegrass Situation. His most recent release is a track titled \\"Drift Away\\". The video for the single premiered on Twangville on January 24, 2019.

History  In 1973 a group of young scientists from Wroclaw University of Technology led by Professor Zdzislaw Bubnicki invited scientists from around the world in order to exchange ideas of modern problems of systems science and engineering. The first International Conference \\"Systems Science\\" was held in the European city of Wroclaw, Poland (with some sessions organized in nearby town Szklarska Poręba). The event was a big success and the organizers decided to continue with the conference every year. First six editions of Systems Science (till 1979) were organized by Wroclaw University of Technology - attracting scientist from the USA, Japan, India and almost all European countries. After six years of existence, the conference was already well known as a forum for presentation of original papers on a good professional level and for discussions integrating different subjects of systems science and engineering and specialists from universities, research centres, and industry. During the conference in 1979, Professor Zdzislaw Bubnicki decided to organize future conferences in Wroclaw every two years, and Professor Glyn James and his colleagues from the Coventry University in England suggested that they join a team from Wroclaw to organize the conferences in alternate years in Coventry. Consequently, the next edition in 1980 took place in Coventry. In 1983, Professor William Wells from the University of Nevada Las Vegas, USA and his colleagues joined the teams from Poland and England, and the next meeting in 1984 was organized in Las Vegas, USA. Then it was decided, that to call conferences in Poland as \\"Systems Science\\" and in England and USA as \\"Systems Engineering\\".Jerzy Józefczyk, History of conferences \\"Systems Science\\", Kybernetes, Conference proceedings are published in Springer Publishing or IEEE CS Publishing, and are indexed by ISI Web of Science Proceedings, DBLP, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and Springerlink.

He studied at Strängnäs and Uppsala then left Sweden to study at Greifswald. Thunmann was professor of philosophy at the University of Halle.  \\"Eastern Europeans\\"  Thunmann made extensive study of the peoples of Eastern Europe. He was the first author to use the term \\"Eastern Europeans\\" in a book title, in his Untersuchungen über die Geschichte der östlichen europäischen Völker, 1774. Thunmann's work served as a liberal agenda for nations without nation states. Thunmann was one of the scientists who did not believe that Bulgarians are Slavs, or at least not \\"pure Slavs\\". He believed that Vlachs are descendants of old Thracian and Dacian tribes or Getic people. In 1825, based also on Thunmann's works, Mikhail Pogodin wrote his thesis \\"On the origins of the Rus'\\" which supports the Normanist theory of Russian origins.  Albanians  Thunmann was one of the most important early authors writing about the language and origin of Albanians. The first serious attempts to present scientific explanation of the origin of Albanians began with Thunmann. He believed that the history and language of Albanians, besides Aromanians, were the least known European people in the West. Thunmann was the first scholar to disseminate the theory about the autochthonous Albanians and to present the Illyrian theory of the origin of Albanians. Thunmann researched the origin of the term \\"Skipatar\\", the term Albanians use as their ethnic name. In 1774 Thunmann republished a three-language (Albanian, Greek and Aromanian) lexicon Theodor Kavalioti first published in 1770, and later added a Latin translation.

It ceased operation as a segregated high school in 1970. History Bryson High School began operations in 1954 with 567 students in grades 7-12. The school was named in honor of Joseph Raleigh Bryson who had served as a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives as a representative for Greenville County; he served from 1939 until his death in 1953. Dr. A.M. Anderson was the first principal of the new school. The new Bryson High School was located at the old P. Meadors homestead on approximately . The Greenville County School District bought the land on December 1, 1952, for nine thousand dollars. Construction was completed in about two years. The new school consisted of a main hall, gymnasium, related- arts wing, cafeteria, and an auditorium. February 13, 1970, marked the date of one of the most significant events in Greenville County's educational history. Schools were ordered by the federal courts to integrate with an 80:20 ratio of whites to blacks (the statistical ratio of whites to blacks in the county.) To fulfill this order, 12,000 students in the school system had to be reassigned. Bryson High School was one of the schools affected. The tenth and eleventh graders from Bryson were assigned to Hillcrest High School. Ninth graders from Hillcrest High went to Bryson to complete the integration process. Bryson High became a ninth-grade center. In the fall of 1973, Bryson High changed from a ninth-grade center into a middle school to serve students in grades six through eighth. In August 1993, Bryson Middle School relocated to its present location. The staff and students moved into a renovated building, the former Hillcrest High School. Today Bryson Middle School is a regionally accredited public middle school serving grades six through eight. It is one of the largest of the eighteen middle schools in Greenville County (over 1000 students) and is adjacent to the county's largest school, Hillcrest High. This school serves the cities of Fountain Inn and Simpsonville.

History The dolmen was constructed during the Megalithic period, approximately around 2900 BC. The first explorations of the site were completed by J. Coelho, who collected ceramic fragments. At the time, the ceiling was discovered caved-in, and the pillar to the south broken and fallen, that occurred sometime at the beginning of the 20th century. The southern pillar, near the opening and the northern pillar by the master stone were also intact, although a pillar was crossed within the interior chamber. In 1955, Irisalva Moita visited the site, encountering a ruined structure, even as the ceiling remained intact. Excavations by Vera Leisner and Leonel Ribeiro were undertaken in 1966. At that time, the southern pillar at the entranceway and the first and second pillars to the north had fallen. During the dig, the team discovered stones from the ceiling, as well as two pillars with solar or serpentine carvings. The fragmentation of the pillars were associated with tectonic movements, rather than human intervention. Radiocarbon dating of the artefacts unearthed on the site were undertaken on coarse pottery, microliths and flint blades, shale beads and calaite.V. Leisner and L. Ribeiro At another level of the chamber, there were encountered blades and lamellae. The IPPC Serviços de Arquelogia da Zona Centro (Centro Zone Archaeological Services intervened at the site in 1988, with archaeological excavations under the direction of Raquel Vilaça. This led to the 1990 work to consolidate the site, including supporting two pillars with iron and cement, drainage to the north pillar and repairing fragments that were encountered spread in the surrounding area. Architecture Located near Guarda, the dolmen is located in a rural landscape, isolated on the western margin of the Ribeira do Carapito, encircled to the north by pine-trees. The structure was part of three dolmens encountered and explored by V. Leisner and L. Ribeiro in the civil parish of Carapito in 1966. Carapito I is the type of megalithic dolmen characterised by I. Moita as a simple structure with a ten- sided polygonal chamber without a corridor, facing the northwest. The pillars or stone sheets are about height and medium width. Alongside the ravine is the \\"ceiling\\" of the dolmen. To the south, is the main slab and four pillars, with the first alongside the entranceway, fractured (but consolidated with iron and cement). Peninsular, constituting a reduction in chamber dolmens and developed corridor. However, the variant most characteristic of Beira is the dolmen polygonal chamber with short or incipient corridor, like the Carapito III and IV dolmens. Carapito I is a large dolmen with two pillars decorated with solar and serpentine motifs. It is largely fragmented, but partially reconstituted, situated on fertile soil, indicating the existence of an agrarian community.

Does He Know What He's Talking About?\\" by W. Ward Gasque Harpur claims that the New Testament shares a large number of similarities with ancient Egyptian and other pagan religions, that early Church leaders fabricated a literal and human Jesus based on ancient myths, and that we should return to an inclusive and universal religion where the spirit of Christ or Christos lives within each of us. The book was named the Canadian non-fiction bestseller of the year by both the Toronto Star and The Globe and Mail. It was later released under the title The Pagan Christ: Is Blind Faith Killing Christianity? in the United States by Walker Books and in Australia by Allen Unwin. It has also been published in five foreign languages: in Montreal (Le Christ païen) by Éditions du Boréal, in the Netherlands (De heidense Christus) by Ankh-Hermes bv, in Germany (Der heidnische Heiland) by Ansata Verlag, in Brazil (O Cristo Dos Pagaos) by Editora Cultrix-Pensamento and in Japan (異教キリスト) by Basilico.http://www.tomharpur.com/books/paganchrist/http://www.thomasallen.ca/site/Rights.aspx In 2007, the book became the basis for a CBC documentary, and that same year, Harpur published a more scholarly sequel entitled Water Into Wine: An Empowering Vision of the Gospels. Synopsis=Similarities between Christianity and pagan religions Throughout the book, Harpur details stories and sayings in the New Testament which he claims also appear in ancient myths, particularly pointing out the similarities between Jesus and the Egyptian sun god Horus. He states that a number of pagan cultures in different regions and time periods drew on symbolic themes such as virgin birth, deity father, star in the east, raising of the dead, descent into hell, crucifixion, resurrection, and others. Harpur claims that virtually all words and actions attributed to Jesus in the gospels \\"originated thousands of years before.\\"Tom Harpur, The Pagan Christ (Toronto: Thomas Allen Publishers, 2004), p. 10. Although early church leaders such as Justin Martyr and St. Augustine reportedly acknowledged certain commonalities between pagan religions and Christianity, Harpur explains that the extent of these similarities was hidden until the discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799. Plagiarism by the early Christian church According to Harpur, most modern biblical scholars agree the gospels were written many decades after the presumed death of Jesus, and he concludes the scriptures are inconsistent, inaccurate and do not represent a verifiable historical record. Harpur even makes the case that the original authors of the New Testament set out to combine popular pagan myths with prophecies of the Old Testament, never intending for readers to take these allegorical stories literally. In what he calls \\"one of the most far-reaching tragedies in history,\\" he presents the case that the Christian church in the third and fourth centuries \\"made a fatal and fateful error,\\" namely inventing the myth of a literal and historical Jesus based on \\"sublime truth.\\"Harpur, 2004, p. 2 He further suggests that ultra-conservative Christianists \\"did everything in their power, through forgery and other fraud, book burning, character assassination, and murder itself, to destroy the crucial evidence.\\"Harpur, 2004, pp. 12-13 According to Harpur's sources, their propaganda included selectively editing the scriptures and inserting false passages about Jesus into the text of the Jewish historian Josephus.Harpur, 2004, pp. 55 Personal doubt about historic Jesus Asking the question, \\"can we say with any authority that Jesus of Nazareth actually existed as historical person\\", he concludes, \\"I have a very grave doubts we can,\\" adding that his gradual realization that Jesus was a \\"mythical copy of many preceding saviours\\" was difficult to accept himself.Harpur, 2004, pp. 158 Consistent with the Jesus myth theory, Harpur contends, \\"there is no hard historical evidence for Jesus' existence,\\" and \\"no contemporary non-Christian writer even knew of Jesus.\\"Harpur, 2004, p. 160 Noting his belief that the Pauline epistles or letters of Saint Paul (which were written before the four gospels), do not mention the parables and miracles of Christ, and make no reference to biographical details like Nazareth, Harpur concludes, \\"I am compelled, therefore, by my own independent research to agree that Paul's Christ was not Jesus of Nazareth.\\"Harpur, 2004, p. 173 To that end, he states that biblical literalism \\"commits idolatry by making a flesh-and-blood man into God,\\"Harpur, 2004, p. 175 and that worshiping a perfect superman with magical powers who supposedly lived 2000 years ago is not a sustainable path for the future of Christianity. Continued belief in the divine Christ On Harpur's website and jacket cover, The Pagan Christ is said to reveal \\"a cosmic faith built on these truths that the modern church has renounced\\", and calling for a \\"return to an inclusive religion where Christ lives within each of us.\\" According to Harpur, he has spent his entire life searching for answers, and now that he understands the scriptures represent symbolic allegories on a central theme rather than cryptic history, God seems more \\"relevant and real,\\"Harpur, 2004, p. 176 and \\"the Bible comes alive wholly in a new way.\\"Harpur, 2004, p. 181 Instead of challenging his religious faith, Harpur attests that his discoveries \\"have made a joyous and life-changing imprint,\\" which have \\"transformed my view of the future of Christianity it into one of hope.\\"Harpur, 2004, p. 3 Sources The bibliography for The Pagan Christ contains over 80 published authors who are cited in the book. Harpur has been studying the classics and the Bible since he was a Rhodes Scholar in the early 1950s, and he draws on individuals as diverse as St. Augustine and Sigmund Freud for supporting quotes. However, he bases many of his arguments on the writings of relatively unknown authors Alvin Boyd Kuhn (to whom the book is dedicated), Gerald Massey and Godfrey Higgins. He also opens himself to criticism by quoting contemporary atheists such as Earl Doherty and Acharya S, who are often targeted by biblical literalists and apologists. As for \\"scholars and critics who believe that Jesus was not historical\\", Harpur presents a list from American historian Harry Elmer Barnes, that was first published 1929, featuring Bruno Bauer, Albert Kalthoff, Arthur Drews, J. C. Stendel, Emil Felden, Peter Jensen, Samuel Lublinski, Gerard Bolland, Gustaaf van den Bergh, Charles Virolleaud, Paul-Louis Couchoud, Gerald Massey, Emilio Bossi, Georg Brandes, J. M. Robertson, G.R.S. Mead, Thomas Whittaker, Edward Carpenter and W. B. Smith. (Andrzej Niemojewski and Deye were noted in the original Barnes list but omitted from the list in The Pagan Christ)Harpur, 2004, p. 163 (note; Stendel may be a transcription error of Friedrich Steudel and Deye of Albert Bayet) CBC documentary In December 2007, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation aired a documentary called The Pagan Christ, based on Harpur's book, as part of its Doc Zone series. Filmed by Bank Productions, it was one of the most-watched television documentaries in Canada that year and received mostly favourable comments on the CBC website.https://web.archive.org/web/20080513171957/http://www.tomharpur.com/documentary- afterword.asp  Harpur's archived afterword, December 2007 The program won the Platinumo Remi Award at the Houston International Film Festival and the Golden Camera Award for best documentary at the U.S. International Film and Video Festival in Redondo Beach, California. The Pagan Christ joins a list of documentaries with sensational claims against orthodox Christianity that have originally aired before either Christmas or Easter, that includes Bible Secrets Revealed (November to December, 2013) and The Lost Tomb of Christ (March, 2007). Reception In a 2004 article entitled \\"The Leading Religion Writer in Canada ... Does He Know What He's Talking About?\\", Vancouver-based pastor W. Ward Gasque strongly critiques The Pagan Christ, claiming the \\"evidence for Jesus as a historical personage is incontrovertible.\\" He reports that only one of the ten Egyptologists who responded to his emails (nine of whom were not identified) were familiar with Kuhn, Higgins and Massey, and that they unanimously dismissed an Egyptian etymology for Jesus. Ron Leprohon, Professor of Egyptology at the University of Toronto, has demonstrated that Harpur and his mentor, Alvin Boyd Kuhn, were wrong on at least one point. Harpur and Kuhn's claim that the Egyptian deity Horus and Jesus are the same deity is based on faulty syntax. 'In any event, the name 'Iusa' simply does not exist in Egyptian.'Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea, Stanley Porter and Stephen Bedard (Toronto: Clements Publishing, 2006), 73 James A. Beverley, author and professor at Tyndale Seminary in Toronto, wrote a brief article in 2004 called \\"The Pagan Tom Harpur\\" for the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada, using a more light-hearted tone than the title suggested.Stanley E Porter and Stephen J. Bedard, Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea (Toronto: Clements Publishing, 2006), 73. Stanley E. Porter and Stephen J. Bedard offer a refutation of Harpur's ideas from an evangelical standpoint in Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea. The 2006 book from Clements Publishing challenges the key ideas lying at the foundation of Harpur's thesis. Porter, president and dean of McMaster Divinity College in Hamilton, and Stephen J. Bedard, a Baptist minister and graduate of McMaster Divinity, state, 'If the proponents of the Pagan Christ theory had any evidence even close to the quality of The Epic of Gilgamesh material, there would be some reason to consider their claims. Unfortunately for their arguments, their evidence lacks substance and the claims are, therefore, shockingly weak.'Stanley E Porter and Stephen J. Bedard, Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea (Toronto: Clements Publishing, 2006), 69. Porter and Bedard conclude that there is sufficient evidence for the historicity of Jesus and assert that Harpur is motivated to promote \\"universalistic spirituality\\". Porter appeared in the CBC documentary, and David Brady Productions approached the authors about creating a counter documentary for Canada's VisionTV in 2008.Stephen Bedard's Hope website Porter's colleague at McMaster Divinity College, Gordon L. Heath, also produced a paper called \\"Neither Scholarly or a Solution\\" which offers a critique of the book. The author concedes he agrees with Harpur on several points such as their shared aversion to rigid fundamentalism and that the church has done shameful things in the past, but disagrees on most other points.Neither Scholarly Nor A Solution: A Response to Tom Harpur's The Pagan Christ. Gordon L. Heath. In 2009, theologian and author Robert M. Price wrote a review which raised a number of concerns about Harpur's premise and evidence. Price noted that the book \\"contains many dubious fact claims\\".\\"Tom Harpur, The Pagan Christ: Recovering the Lost Light\\". Robert M. Price. Bart D. Ehrman Professor of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on his ehrmanblog in 2012 and in his book published the same year, Did Jesus Exist? The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth, lists Harpur along with other \\"mythicists\\" such as Price, but does not specifically criticize the details in The Pagan Christ. In 2013, New Testament scholar Craig A. Evans noted that the views of Harpur and Kuhn have been \\"thoroughly refuted and is not followed by any reputable historian or Egyptologist.\\"Evans, Craig A.

It was named to honor David Brower, a Berkeley native who was the first executive director of the Sierra Club and founder of the League of Conservation Voters. The Center is part of a larger mixed use development that includes the Oxford Plaza (an affordable housing complex with street level commercial space). The David Brower Center's mission is to \\"inspire and nurture current and future generations of leaders, with the goal of making sustainable thinking and practices mainstream.\\" The David Brower Center is home to dozens of organizations which occupy the three floors of office space, including Earth Island Institute, Friends of the Earth (both of which were founded by David Brower), as well as Equity Community Builders, Impact Hub, Strategen, and several others. In addition to housing nonprofit organizations, since 2009, the Hazel Wolf Gallery within the Brower Center has highlighted the work of many artists, including Sebastião Salgado, Daniel McCormick, David Liittschwager, Laura Cunningham, Isabella Kirkland, Chris Jordan, David Maisel, Jeffrey Long, Bill Curtsinger, Joseph Holmes, and more recently, Richard Misrach and Douglas Gayeton. Building Design The Brower Center, which was designed by firm WRT/Solomon E.T.C. (now Mithun), completed construction and opened its doors in 2009. The Center makes use of a number of sustainable technologies and design techniques that came out of a highly integrated design process including radiant heating and cooling, daylighting, shading, underfloor air distribution (UFAD), natural ventilation through operable windows, solar panels, rainwater harvesting, and a building dashboard. In 2010, the Center received a LEED Platinum rating from the US Green Building Council. An occupant survey conducted by the Center for the Built Environment in the spring of 2010 indicated that the general satisfaction of the building is 1.78 out of a scale of -3 (very dissatisfied) to +3 (very satisfied). In a post occupancy evaluation conducted by an architecture class at the University of California, Berkeley, over half of the questionnaire respondents said that the building was inspiring in regard to sustainability. Heating and Cooling The primary method for space conditioning is a hydronic, in-slab radiant system that is located in the exposed concrete ceiling slabs on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th floors. These systems are often referred to as thermally activated building systems. The radiant system is used for both heating and cooling. To chill the water in the radiant system, the system makes use of a cooling tower located on the roof. Because the radiant system has a large surface area and high thermal mass, it is able to use warmer chilled water temperatures than a typical cooling system. This makes it a good match for non-compressor-based cooling. The cooling tower is able to chill the supply water using only the outdoor air, without any chiller. Daylighting The offices in the David Brower Center have almost 100% continuous daylighting autonomy. This metric indicates the percentage of occupied hours that can rely purely on sunlight for lighting the space. The building achieves this continuous daylight autonomy through the use of light shelves and glazed facades on the south and east sides of the building, in addition to a fairly narrow building depth of . The heights of individual floors were driven by daylight availability and programmatic requirements. The ground floor, which has reduced daylight availability due to surrounding site obstructions, has the highest floor-to-floor height, while the top floor, which is partially daylit from roof-level skylights, has the lowest floor-to- floor height. Shading and Solar Panels Lining the façade of the David Brower Center are fixed exterior aluminum louvers. These louvers block the direct sun and minimize heat gains within the building. In addition to the exterior shading devices, occupants can make further adjustments from within the building using manually-operated interior roller fabric shades above each window. On top of the David Brower Center, there is a photovoltaic array that offsets approximately 35 percent of the building’s electricity energy demand. The solar panels are located on the northern and southern edges of the roof parapet, and double as an awning for the southern façade to reduce solar heat gain. The PV array is orientation is design for maximum exposure to daylight. Building Structure The Brower Center is designed to withstand seismic activity by allowing the structure to flex without incurring serious deformation. This is done through the combination of horizontally post- tensioned moment frames with a vertically post-tensioned core. The core comprises uniformly arrayed columns and two centrally located, C-shaped, walls. The entire structure is supported by a mat foundation. All concrete used in the building structure contains slag, a byproduct of steel manufacturing. Slag is used to substitute a portion of the Portland cement (70% in the foundations and 50% in the superstructure). The addition of slag reduced an estimated 5000 tons of CO2 emissions from the concrete production.

The town was originally a stagecoach stop known as Antelope Station, and was later renamed \\"Stanton\\" after the businessman and crook Chuck Stanton, who took over the town in the 1870s. Stanton is located about twenty miles north of Wickenburg, at the base of Rich Hill, near the ghost towns of Octave and Weaver. History The town of Stanton, like the towns of Octave and Weaver, owe their existence to a group of pioneers who discovered gold in the area in 1863. Led by the frontiersman Pauline Weaver, the explorers were camped along Antelope Creek when one of the men - a tracker named Alvaro - decided to go chasing after a runaway burro. After climbing to the top of what would become known as Rich Hill, Alvaro tripped over a pile of gold nuggets that were \\"as big as potatoes.\\" Soon after, Pauline Weaver and a friend named Jack Swilling found another pile of gold on top of nearby Antelope Hill. Weaver said that gold was so plentiful in the area that he could pop nuggets out of the ground with a knife, and that one acre yielded nearly $500,000 in gold. The 1863 strike transformed Antelope Station into a boomtown overnight. Originally just a small stage stop, by 1868 Antelope Station supported a population of 3,500 people. Chuck Stanton first arrived in town a few years later. He wasted no time in recruiting the help of some Mexican bandits so he could wipe out his competition and take control of the town. His first two victims were his neighbors, George \\"Yaqui\\" Wilson and William Partridge, both of whom owned a store and a stage stop. In August 1877, Stanton tricked Partridge into killing Wilson over some pigs, and so Partridge was arrested and sent to the Yuma Territorial Prison. Once Wilson and Partridge were out of the way, Stanton focused on Wilson's business partner, John Timmerman, who arrived in town from Smith's Mill and formed a new partnership with a family- man named Barney Martin. Stanton's plan for dealing with Timmerman and Martin wasn't nearly as clever as Wilson's murder had been planned. He simply had his bandits ambush them out in the desert. The bandits also killed Barney's wife and his two little boys in what has since become known as the \\"Martin Family Massacre.\\" Stanton was arrested for the murders, but due to the testimony of several false witnesses, the charges against him were dropped. Later on that year, however, Stanton was killed by a Mexican gunman named Lucero, and buried about a mile outside of town. Following Stanton's death, the town continued to thrive for several years, but it was still considered to be a dangerous place. In 1892, for example, a Prescott newspaper reported that the residents of Stanton liked to \\"drink blood, eat fried rattlesnakes and fight mountain lions\\". Nevertheless, by the 1890s, Stanton was a legitimate community filled with miners, their families, a general store, a stamp mill, a hotel, a boarding house, and several other associated buildings. For some inexplicable reason, the town's name was officially changed back to Stanton in 1896. It didn't survive for much longer, though. By 1905 the gold in the area was just about gone. That same year the Stanton Post Office was closed for good, and the town was abandoned. In the late 1950s, The Saturday Evening Post purchased the ten acre town and then gave it away during a \\"jingle contest.\\" The new owners didn't know what to do with the town, and they later sold it. It remained uninhabited until the late 1960s, when hippies moved in and started burning the wooden buildings for firewood. In 1976, the Lost Dutchman's Mining Association (LDMA) acquired the property and has since used the town as a members-only recreational vehicle park, which is open for six months out of the year. The LDMA has restored a few of the town's original buildings, including Chuck Stanton's store, an old saloon and dance hall, and a hotel. The town jail is also standing, and work has been done to restore the town's pioneer cemeteries.

The house was built by Thomas W. Hartley between 1914 and 1919, on property bought by his father, James Hartley, about 1880. The house was designed to accommodate the Hartley Family (Thomas, his wife Ida Stanton Hartley and their children Lucy, Clarine, Leonard and Orion). The Parlor of the Palm Harbor MuseumThe house was built on a reinforced concrete foundation with concrete block construction. The blocks were poured on-site, made with white sane from a nearby scrub. The outside surfaces of the blocks were cast to simulate a stone finish. Each block weighed 84 pounds and the blocks were joined with pink mortar, which is said to have gotten its unusual color from crushed berries. A hall ran the length of the downstairs and its walls were reinforced concrete to provide bearing support for the second floor. Downstairs rooms have 10 foot high ceilings and upstairs are 8 feet high. The upstairs rooms and two of the planned porches were never completed by the family due to shortage of funds. The house was acquired in 1996 by Pinellas County as part of the extension of Belcher Rd; it is under the management of the Heritage village and houses the Palm Harbor Museum which is dedicated to preserving the history of Palm Harbor, Crystal Beach, Florida, Ozona, and Curlew from the 1800s to the present. The Palm Harbor Museum opened in 1998 and is operated by the Palm Harbor Historical Society. It is located at 2043 Curlew Road. Current exhibitions include the history of the Citrus Industry, Palm Harbor in World War II and the Way we worked. The house also highlights the lives of the Hartley Family and how they lived. Many of the downstairs rooms were preserved and along with some original furniture you can see how this family lived during this period. Admission is $3.00 per person, children under 12 free.

The book covers topics in biosemiotics, philosophy of mind, and the origins of life. Broadly, the book seeks to naturalistically explain \\"aboutness\\", that is, concepts like intentionality, meaning, normativity, purpose, and function; which Deacon groups together and labels as ententional phenomena. Core Ideas Deacon's first book, The Symbolic Species focused on the evolution of human language. In that book, Deacon notes that much of the mystery surrounding language origins comes from a profound confusion about the nature of semiotic processes themselves. Accordingly, the focus of Incomplete Nature shifts from human origins to the origin of life and semiosis. Incomplete Nature can be viewed as a sizable contribution to the growing body of work positing that the problem of consciousness and the problem of the origin of life are inexorably linked.Slanted Truths: Essays on Gaia, Symbiosis and Evolution. Lynn Margulis, Dorion Sagan, 1997Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind. Evan Thompson. 2012 Deacon tackles these two linked problems by going back to basics. The book expands upon the classical conceptions of work and information in order to give an account of ententionality that is consistent with eliminative materialism and yet does not seek to explain away or pass off as epiphenominal the non-physical properties of life. Constraints A central thesis of the book is that absence can still be efficacious. Deacon makes the claim that just as the concept of zero revolutionized mathematics, thinking about life, mind, and other ententional phenomena in terms of constraints (i.e., what is absent) can similarly help us overcome the artificial dichotomy of the mind body problem. A good example of this concept is the hole that defines the hub of a wagon wheel. The hole itself is not a physical thing, but rather a source of constraint that helps to restrict the conformational possibilities of the wheel's components, such that, on a global scale, the property of rolling emerges. Constraints which produce emergent phenomena may not be a process which can be understood by looking at the make- up of the constituents of a pattern. Emergent phenomena are difficult to study because their complexity does not necessarily decompose into parts. When a pattern is broken down, the constraints are no longer at work; there is no hole, no absence to notice. Imagine a hub, a hole for an axle, produced only when the wheel is rolling, thus breaking the wheel may not show you how the hub emerges. Orthograde and contragrade Deacon notes that the apparent patterns of causality exhibited by living systems seem to be in some ways the inverse of the causal patterns of non-living systems. In an attempt to find a solution to the philosophical problems associated with teleological explanations, Deacon returns to Aristotle's four causes and attempts to modernize them with thermodynamic concepts. A cartoon characterization of the asymmetry implicit in thermodynamic change from a constrained (\\"ordered\\") state to a less constrained (\\"disordered\\") state, which tends to occur spontaneously (an orthograde process), contrasted with the reversed direction of change, which does not tend to occur spontaneously (a contragrade process), and so only tends to occur in response to the imposition of highly constrained external work (arrows in the image on the right). Orthograde changes are caused internally. They are spontaneous changes. That is, orthograde changes are generated by the spontaneous elimination of asymmetries in a thermodynamic system in disequilibrium. Because orthograde changes are driven by the internal geometry of a changing system, orthograde causes can be seen as analogous to Aristotle's formal cause. More loosely, Aristotle's final cause can also be considered orthograde, because goal oriented actions are caused from within.Incomplete Nature, pp. 260 Contragrade changes are imposed from the outside. They are non-spontaneous changes. Contragrade change is induced when one thermodynamic system interacts with the orthograde changes of another thermodynamic system. The interaction drives the first system into a higher energy, more asymmetrical state. Contragrade changes do work. Because contragrade changes are driven by external interactions with another changing system, contragrade causes can be seen as analogous to Aristotle's efficient cause.Incomplete Nature, pp. 260 Homeodynamics, morphodynamics, and teleodynamics Much of the book is devoted to expanding upon the ideas of classical thermodynamics, with an extended discussion about how consistently far from equilibrium systems can interact and combine to produce novel emergent properties. 400px Deacon defines three hierarchically nested levels of thermodynamic systems: Homeodynamic systems combine to produce morphodynamic systems which combine to produce teleodynamic systems. Teleodynamic systems can be further combined to produce higher orders of self organization. Homeodynamics Homeodynamic systems are essentially equivalent to classical thermodynamic systems like a gas under pressure or solute in solution, but the term serves to emphasize that homeodynamics is an abstract process that can be realized in forms beyond the scope of classic thermodynamics. For example, the diffuse brain activity normally associated with emotional states can be considered to be a homeodynamic system because there is a general state of equilibrium which its components (neural activity) distribute towards.Incomplete Nature, pp.561 \\"Experience should have clear equilibrium-tending, dissipative, and self-organizing characteristics, besides those that are intentional. These are inseparable dynamical features that literally constitute experience.\\" In general, a homeodynamic system is any collection of components that will spontaneously eliminate constraints by rearranging the parts until a maximum entropy state (disorderliness) is achieved. Morphodynamics A morphodynamic system consists of a coupling of two homeodynamic systems such that the constraint dissipation of each complements the other, producing macroscopic order out of microscopic interactions. Morphodynamic systems require constant perturbation to maintain their structure, so they are relatively rare in nature. The paradigm example of a morphodynamic system is a Rayleigh–Bénard cell. Other common examples are snowflake formation, whirlpools and the stimulated emission of laser light. Benard Cell Maximum entropy production: The organized structure of a morphodynamic system forms to facilitate maximal entropy production. In the case of a Rayleigh–Bénard cell, heat at the base of the liquid produces an uneven distribution of high energy molecules which will tend to diffuse towards the surface. As the temperature of the heat source increases, density effects come into play. Simple diffusion can no longer dissipate energy as fast as it is added and so the bottom of the liquid becomes hot and more buoyant than the cooler, denser liquid at the top. The bottom of the liquid begins to rise, and the top begins to sink - producing convection currents. Two systems: The significant heat differential on the liquid produces two homeodynamic systems. The first is a diffusion system, where high energy molecules on the bottom collide with lower energy molecules on the top until the added kinetic energy from the heat source is evenly distributed. The second is a convection system, where the low density fluid on the bottom mixes with the high density fluid on the top until the density becomes evenly distributed. The second system arises when there is too much energy to be effectively dissipated by the first, and once both systems are in place, they will begin to interact. Self organization: The convection creates currents in the fluid that disrupt the pattern of heat diffusion from bottom to top. Heat begins to diffuse into the denser areas of current, irrespective of the vertical location of these denser portions of fluid. The areas of the fluid where diffusion is occurring most rapidly will be the most viscous because molecules are rubbing against each other in opposite directions. The convection currents will shun these areas in favor of parts of the fluid where they can flow more easily. And so the fluid spontaneously segregates itself into cells where high energy, low density fluid flows up from the center of the cell and cooler, denser fluid flows down along the edges, with diffusion effects dominating in the area between the center and the edge of each cell. Synergy and constraint: What is notable about morphodynamic processes is that order spontaneously emerges explicitly because the ordered system that results is more efficient at increasing entropy than a chaotic one. In the case of the Rayleigh–Bénard cell, neither diffusion nor convection on their own will produce as much entropy as both effects coupled together. When both effects are brought into interaction, they constrain each other into a particular geometric form because that form facilitates minimal interference between the two processes. The orderly hexagonal form is stable as long as the energy differential persists, and yet the orderly form more effectively degrades the energy differential than any other form. This is why morphodynamic processes in nature are usually so short lived. They are self organizing, but also self undermining. Teleodynamics A teleodynamic system consists of coupling two morphodynamic systems such that the self undermining quality of each is constrained by the other. Each system prevents the other from dissipating all of the energy available, and so long term organizational stability is obtained. Deacon claims that we should pinpoint the moment when two morphodynamic systems reciprocally constrain each other as the point when ententional qualities like function, purpose and normativity emerge.Incomplete Nature pg. 355 =Autogenesis= Deacon explores the properties of teleodynamic systems by describing a chemically plausible model system called an autogen. Deacon emphasizes that the specific autogen he describes is not a proposed description of the first life form, but rather a description of the kinds of thermodynamic synergies that the first living creature likely possessed.The transition from constraint to regulation at the origin of life. Frontiers in Bioscience. Terrence W. Deacon, Alok Srivastava, and J. Augustus Bacigalupi Autogen pg 339 Reciprocal catalysis: An autogen consists of two self catalyzing cyclical morphodynamic chemical reactions, similar to a chemoton. In one reaction, organic molecules react in a looped series, the products of one reaction becoming the reactants for the next. This looped reaction is self amplifying, producing more and more reactants until all the substrate is consumed. A side product of this reciprocally catalytic loop is a lipid that can be used as a reactant in a second reaction. This second reaction creates a boundary (either a microtubule or some other closed capsid like structure), that serves to contain the first reaction. The boundary limits diffusion; it keeps all of the necessary catalysts in close proximity to each other. In addition, the boundary prevents the first reaction from completely consuming all of the available substrate in the environment. The first self: Unlike an isolated morphodynamic process whose organization rapidly eliminates the energy gradient necessary to maintain its structure, a teleodynamic process is self-limiting and self-preserving. The two reactions complement each other, and ensure that neither ever runs to equilibrium - that is completion, cessation, and death. So, in a teleodynamic system there will be structures that embody a preliminary sketch of a biological function. The internal reaction network functions to create the substrates for the boundary reaction, and the boundary reaction functions to protect and constrain the internal reaction network. Either process in isolation would be abiotic but together they create a system with a normative status dependent on the functioning of its component parts. Work As with other concepts in the book, in his discussion of work Deacon seeks to generalize the Newtonian conception of work such that the term can be used to describe and differentiate mental phenomena - to describe \\"that which makes daydreaming effortless but metabolically equivalent problem solving difficult.\\"Incomplete Nature, pg.365 Work is generally described as \\"activity that is necessary to overcome resistance to change. Resistance can be either active or passive, and so work can be directed towards enacting change that wouldn't otherwise occur or preventing change that would happen in its absence.\\"Incomplete Nature, pg. 366 Using the terminology developed earlier in the book, work can be considered to be \\"the organization of differences between orthograde processes such that a locus of contragrade process is created. Or, more simply, work is a spontaneous change inducing a non-spontaneous change to occur.\\"Incomplete Nature, pg.371 Thermodynamic work A thermodynamic systems capacity to do work depends less upon the total energy of the system and more upon the geometric distribution of its components. A glass of water at 20 degrees Celsius will have the same amount of energy as a glass divided in half with the top fluid at 30 degrees and the bottom at 10, but only in the second glass will the top half have the capacity to do work upon the bottom. This is because work occurs at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. Microscopically, there is constant work being performed on one molecule by another when they collide. But the potential for this microscopic work to additively sum to macroscopic work depends on there being an asymmetric distribution of particle speeds, so that the average collision pushes in a focused direction. Microscopic work is necessary but not sufficient for macroscopic work. A global property of asymmetric distribution is also required. Morphodynamic work By recognizing that asymmetry is a general property of work - that work is done as asymmetric systems spontaneously tend towards symmetry, Deacon abstracts the concept of work and applies it to systems whose symmetries are vastly more complex than those covered by classical thermodynamics. In a morphodynamic system, the tendency towards symmetry produces not global equilibrium, but a complex geometric form like a hexagonal Benard cell or the resonant frequency of a flute. This tendency towards convolutedly symmetric forms can be harnessed to do work on other morphodynamic systems, if the systems are properly coupled. Resonance example: A good example of morphodynamic work is the induced resonance that can be observed by singing or playing a flute next to a string instrument like a harp or guitar. The vibrating air emitted from the flute will interact with the taut strings. If any of the strings are tuned to a resonant frequency that matches the note being played, they too will begin to vibrate and emit sound. Contragrade change: When energy is added to the flute by blowing air into it, there is a spontaneous (orthograde) tendency for the system to dissipate the added energy by inducing the air within the flute to vibrate at a specific frequency. This orthograde morphodynamic form generation can be used to induce contragrade change in the system coupled to it - the taught string. Playing the flute does work on the string by causing it to enter a high energy state that could not be reached spontaneously in an uncoupled state. Structure and form: Importantly, this is not just the macro scale propagation of random micro vibrations from one system to another. The global geometric structure of the system is essential. The total energy transferred from the flute to the string matters far less than the patterns it takes in transit. That is, the amplitude of the coupled note is irrelevant, what matters is its frequency. Notes that have a higher or lower frequency than the resonant frequency of the string will not be able to do morphodynamic work. Teleodynamic work Work is generally defined to be the interaction of two orthograde changing systems such that contragrade change is produced.Incomplete Nature pg. 366 In teleodynamic systems, the spontaneous orthograde tendency is not to equilibriate (as in homeodynamic systems), nor to self simplify (as in morphodynamic systems) but rather to tend towards self-preservation. Living organisms spontaneously tend to heal, to reproduce and to pursue resources towards these ends. Teleodynamic work acts on these tendencies and pushes them in a contragrade, non-spontaneous direction. Reading exemplifies the logic of teleodynamic work. A passive source of cognitive constraints is potentially provided by the letterforms on a page. A literate person has structured his or her sensory and cognitive habits to use such letterforms to reorganize the neural activities constituting thinking. This enables us to do teleodynamic work to shift mental tendencies away from those that are spontaneous (such as daydreaming) to those that are constrained by the text. Artist: Giovanni Battista Piazzetta (1682–1754). Evolution as work: Natural selection, or perhaps more accurately, adaptation, can be considered to be a ubiquitous form of teleodynamic work. The othograde self-preservation and reproduction tendencies of individual organisms tends to undermine those same tendencies in conspecifics. This competition produces a constraint that tends to mold organisms into forms that are more adapted to their environments – forms that would otherwise not spontaneously persist. For example, in a population of New Zealand wrybill who make a living by searching for grubs under rocks, those that have a bent beak gain access to more calories. Those with bent beaks are able to better provide for their young, and at the same time they remove a disproportionate quantity of grubs from their environment, making it more difficult for those with straight beaks to provide for their own young. Throughout their lives, all the wrybills in the population do work to structure the form of the next generation. The increased efficiency of the bent beak causes that morphology to dominate the next generation. Thus an asymmetry of beak shape distribution is produced in the population - an asymmetry produced by teleodynamic work. Thought as work: Mental problem solving can also be considered teleodynamic work. Thought forms are spontaneously generated, and task of problem solving is the task of molding those forms to fit the context of the problem at hand. Deacon makes the link between evolution as teleodynamic work and thought as teleodynamic work explicit. \\"The experience of being sentient is what it feels like to be evolution.\\"Incomplete Nature. pg 550 =Emergent causal powers= By conceiving of work in this way, Deacon claims \\"we can begin to discern a basis for a form of causal openness in the universe.\\"Incomplete Nature. pg.379 While increases in complexity in no way alter the laws of physics, by juxtaposing systems together, pathways of spontaneous change can be made available that were inconceivably improbable prior to the systems coupling. The causal power of any complex living system lies not solely in the underlying quantum mechanics but also in the global arrangement of its components. A careful arrangement of parts can constrain possibilities such that phenomena that were formerly impossibly rare can become improbably common. Information One of the central purposes of Incomplete Nature is to articulate a theory of biological information. The first formal theory of information was articulated by Claude Shannon in 1948 in his work A Mathematical Theory of Communication. Shannon's work is widely credited with ushering in the information age, but somewhat paradoxically, it was completely silent on questions of meaning and reference, i.e., what the information is about. As an engineer, Shannon was concerned with the challenge of reliably transmitting a message from one location to another. The meaning and content of the message was largely irrelevant. So, while Shannon information theory has been essential for the development of devices like computers, it has left open many philosophical questions regarding the nature of information. Incomplete Nature seeks to answer some of these questions. Shannon information Shannon's key insight was to recognize a link between entropy and information. Entropy is often defined as a measurement of disorder, or randomness, but this can be misleading. For Shannon's purposes, the entropy of a system is the number of possible states that the system has the capacity to be in. Any one of these potential states can constitute a message. For example, a typewritten page can bear as many different messages as there are different combinations of characters that can be arranged on the page. The information content of a message can only be understood against the background context of all of the messages that could have been sent, but weren't. Information is produced by a reduction of entropy in the message medium. Three nested conceptions of information Boltzmann entropy Shannon's information based conception of entropy should be distinguished from the more classic thermodynamic conception of entropy developed by Ludwig Boltzmann and others at the end of the nineteenth century. While Shannon entropy is static and has to do with the set of all possible messages/states that a signal bearing system might take, Boltzmann entropy has to do with the tendency of all dynamic systems to tend towards equilibrium. That is, there are many more ways for a collection of particles to be well mixed than to be segregated based on velocity, mass, or any other property. Boltzmann entropy is central to the theory of work developed earlier in the book because entropy dictates the direction in which a system will spontaneously tend. Significant information Deacon's addition to Shannon information theory is to propose a method for describing not just how a message is transmitted, but also how it is interpreted. Deacon weaves together Shannon entropy and Boltzmann entropy in order to develop a theory of interpretation based in teleodynamic work. Interpretation is inherently normative. Data becomes information when it has significance for its interpreter. Thus interpretive systems are teleodynamic - the interpretive process is designed to perpetuate itself. \\"The interpretation of something as information indirectly reinforces the capacity to do this again.\\"Incomplete Nature. pg. 434 References * Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter.

Bohan is an American recruiting executive. He is best known as founder of The Liberty Group, a Texas-based staffing and recruiting firm. Bohan is a sitting member of the City of Houston Planning Commission who was appointed by Mayor Annise Parker and unanimously approved by the City Council. Bohan is also the recipient of multiple lifetime achievement awards from the personnel and apartment industries.  Early life  Bohan was born and raised in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He is the only child of Cecilia (Laufersweiler) Bohan, a dietician and stay-at-home mother, and Kenneth E. Bohan, a pediatrician. Bohan attended parochial schools John Carroll Elementary and Bishop McGuinness High before enrolling at Washington University. As a sophomore, Bohan transferred to Central State University (now known as the University of Central Oklahoma), where he received a B.S. degree.  Early career  Bohan worked in a funeral home for six months before asking a college friend for help finding a job in property management. At age 21 he was named Vice President of Property Management despite no experience in real estate management. In 1977, Bohan again made a career change. After being offered a job as a personnel consultant by an agency he approached to help him find a new position, Bohan decided to open his own personnel agency.  The Liberty Group  Bohan founded The Liberty Group in 1977 and opened for business with one employee on January 2, 1978, to provide direct hire placements to the Houston apartment industry. The company was named after the Liberty National Bank and Trust Company, which was the largest bank in Oklahoma City at the time. In addition, according to Bohan the new company \\"...provided me my entrée into business as an entrepreneur, 'my liberty.'\\"  Executive search services  During The Liberty Group's early years Bohan expanded the company's services to provide national executive search and direct hire for commercial real estate. In the early 2000s, the company opened a new division recruiting for IT positions. In 2005, the company opened a banking executive search division focused on commercial banking and SBA positions.  Temporary staffing services  In 1990, Bohan opened a temporary staffing division focused on the Houston apartment industry. The firm opened additional Texas offices, expanding to Dallas in 2006, San Antonio in 2008, Austin in 2009, and Arlington in 2013. The company expanded on a national scale in 2014, opening apartment staffing offices in Washington, DC, Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham (Research Triangle), and Orlando.  Liberty Screening Services  In 1995, Bohan and a business partner, Mary Hubbell, opened a new venture, Liberty Screening Services. This company conducts national pre-employment background screening and drug testing.  United Global Solutions  In 2011, Bohan and a business partner, Gary Wood, opened a new venture, United Global Solutions. This contract and direct hire recruiting firm focuses on five industries: business intelligence and analytics, accounting and finance, oil and gas, geosciences, and IT.  Houston Planning Commission  After serving on two election committees for Mayor Annise Parker, Bohan asked the mayor for additional ways in which he could serve the City of Houston. On June 13, 2012, both Bohan and Eileen Subinsky were named by Mayor Annise Parker to the Houston Planning Commission. According to the Commission, Bohan's responsibilities include \\"...review[ing] and approv[ing] subdivision and development plats. The Commission also studies and makes recommendations to City Council on development issues in Houston.\\"  Notable lifetime achievement awards = Harold B. Nelson Memorial Award  In 2001, Bohan was awarded the Harold B. Nelson Memorial Award by the National Association of Personnel Services. The Nelson Award is the highest individual honor presented to an individual by NAPS. According to the organization, the award is given to \\"...that person/persons who has most distinguished himself/herself in the course of a lifetime of service to the private placement industry, or as a result of a specific action in a given year.\\" The award is not given every year; instead, it is only conferred when NAPS deems an individual's accomplishments worthy of the award.  Houston Apartment Association Lifetime Achievement Award  On August 23, 2012, The Houston Apartment Association awarded Bohan its Lifetime Achievement Award, recognizing his numerous contributions to the multifamily industry. Prior to the presentation of the award, Houston Apartment Association President Jenifer Paneral cited Bohan's \\"tireless dedication and contributions to the industry and the association\\" over more than 40 years. As additional evidence for his award, Mayor Annise Parker also said, \\"Ken Bohan has an impressive list of accomplishments that reflect his passion for community service... His steadfast involvement in the community has made an impression on us all, and we know Houston is a better city with residents like Ken around.\\" Typically, the Houston Apartment Association recognizes a member of the apartment industry with its annual award. Bohan's award was only the fourth time in 52 years that a supplier to the apartment industry had been so recognized.

Bio/Early life Malone was born in 1954 as the youngest of three children to his parents Johnathan and Shirley, growing up on the east side of Cleveland in the Glenville neighborhood. He attended Chesterfield Elementary School (where by his own admission he was a class comedian), and when he became a teenager (after his family had moved to suburban Shaker Heights), he attended Shaker Heights High School, where he graduated in 1972. Malone then went to college, originally attending Cleveland State University, transferring after a semester to Morehouse College in Atlanta, before settling in at Ohio University, where he eventually graduated from in the mid '70s.

History In 1120, either D. Teresa or Afonso Henriques issued a foral (charter) for the territory. This administrative title was reformed in 1258 under the reign of D. Afonso III. But in 1512, King D. Manuel I renewed the foral, at the same time that pillory was installed or re- installed. By 1708, the settlement had 160 neighbours, and was likely in the possession of the Order of Christ. In the 4 June 1758 Memórias Paroquiais, the parish priest José Cardoso das Neves, referred to Aguiar da Beira as a possession of the Casa do Infantado, under the title of the Infante D. Pedro. By that time, it supported two judges, three representatives and prosecutor, as well as a population of 159 residents. In 1896, the municipality was extinguished and its territory integrated into Trancoso. The municipality was reestablished in 1989. Architecture The pillory is situated in the middle of the principal square, between the Rua da Misericórdia, Rua Direita, Rua de Baixo and Rua do Castanheiro. The old square, central to the historic part of the town, is dominated by various important architectural structures, dating to as early as the Middle Ages. Erected close by is impotent tower and simple fountain (from the 14th century), the manorhouse Casa dos Magistrados (15th century) and former Casa da Câmara (the 18th century municipal hall), resulting in the square being known as the Largo dos Monumentos (square of the monuments). Along with the pillory, the Torre Ameada and Fonte Ameada have been classified as Monumentos Nacionais (National Monument).

It is the only known species of its genus. Discovery Fortiholcorpa was discovered in the Jiulongshan Formation at Daohugou Village of Ningcheng County in Inner Mongolia, China. The fossil is late Middle Jurassic in age, from the Callovian–Bathonian boundary (c. 165 million years ago). The genus name is a combination of Latin fortis (meaning strong, in reference to the \\"exceedingly elongate terminal abdominal segments and enlarged genitalia\\") and Holcorpa another Mecopteran with which Fortiholcorpa shows similarities. The specific epithet paradoxa means amazing, in reference to the very long abdominal segments. Description The holotype is a male 73.5 mm in length from head to genital tip. The thorax is poorly preserved, with only the mesothorax and metathorax recognizable. The 7th and 8th abdominal segments are exceedingly long in comparison to other segments. The compound eyes are large and oval-shaped. The antennae are filliform. Classification Fortiholcorpa shares several similarities with Holcorpa, a genus formerly placed in the Panorpidae but now considered the sole genus of the family Holcorpidae. However, Fortiholcorpa shows a different a branching pattern of hindwing M vein, and lacks spurs on the sixth abdominal segment. As such, the describers placed Fortiholcorpa as incertae sedis (uncertain placement) within Mecoptera.

She was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina and the influential daughter of Juan Manuel de Rosas and Encarnación Ezcurra.  Childhood  In a time of caudillos leading the region of Buenos Aires, Manuela grew up in household of ambition under her parents. No one else came close to matching the power and influence of Juan Manuel de Rosas. In addition, her mother was without equal for her position. This created a unique household environment for Manuela growing up. As Monteiro Lobato laments, “Manuelita’s home was a strange mixture of love without tenderness and of companionship without delicacy.” In the chaos of having a caudillo father, Manuela thrived. She was presented to Argentina as a princess figure. Combined with her intellect, Manuela enhanced the image of her less diplomatic father. Where he was an abrasive strongman, she provided the softer touch. Some argue that her spoiled upbringing led to an unquestioning loyalty to her father. When her mother died, she moved to a more elevated status that her mother had occupied.  Political life  Manuela followed the footsteps of her mother, playing an active role in the politics of Argentina. At a time when charisma and garnering support was crucial to becoming the leader, Juan Manuel de Rosas relied on his daughter as the link to the outside world. This was in part because it was dangerous for Juan Manuel de Rosas to be in the public due to his enemies, but also she excelled at her role in the public's eye. Her management of her father’s public relations began early, even as a little girl, entertaining her father’s guests. As an adult, she entertained foreign diplomats and government officials. She could converse in French with Europeans and was also a skilled piano player. In addition, she excelled at building support from various group in Argentina for her father. While he was a symbol of power, she was a more subtle force that complemented her father. There is a famous story of her dancing with a black community that was coming to pay respects to the Rosas, winning them over. This isn’t an isolated example. She captured the attention of all that she hosted. When many suitors wanted her hand in marriage, Juan Manuel de Rosas thought it best for her to remain “La Niña” to all of Buenos Aires. He made her swear that she would never marry and in exchange he would not remarry. During this time, she was very popular in the public’s eyes. Later in life, she married the son of an old associate of her fathers, Máximo Terrero, on the 22nd of October in Southampton. Together, they had two children: Manuel Máximo Juan Nepomuceno and Rodrigo Tomás Terrero y Rosas. Her son Manuel married the English suffragette Jane Beddall in 1885. In breaking this promise, her father never forgave her. Despite this, when Juan Manuel de Rosas was in exile and he asked her not to keep contact, she remained loyal and kept correspondence.  Late life  Later in life, she married the son of an old associate of her fathers. In breaking this promise, her father never forgave her. Despite this, when Juan Manuel de Rosas was sent in exile die to the Battle of Caseros in which he loses, he asks her not to keep contact, she remained loyal and kept correspondence. She died in London on September 17, 1898. She lived a quiet life in exile and never returned to Argentina after the Battle of Caseros. Her active political role starkly contrasts the expectations of postcolonial society in which women were limited to the domestic sphere.  Painting by Prilidiano Pueyrredón  Portrait by Prilidiano Pueyrredón The portrait of Manuela Rosas by Prilidiano Pueyrredón gives some insight into the Rosas period. Manuela de Rosas serves as an exemplar in this painting, and it was commissioned this way. The badge on her dress is meant to convey that everyone in Argentina has an obligation to the Federalist Party of her father. Furthermore, her white skin and European dress is purposeful. Being the public figure that she was, this indicated a lot about what was seen as ideal. Beyond her loyalty to her father, she did break many norms of the time by holding a position in government.

Over time Lima became the signeurial master of Arcos de Valdevez. The group is Manueline in style, architecturally, but also because of the ornamental elements identifying regal heraldry. It is also important to highlight the inscription, authored by João Lopes-o-Velho, who was active in northern Portugal and Galicia, between the 16th century and about 1559. Although there is no clear date, it is frequently referred to as dating from 1531 (António Matos Reis, 2000), suggesting its late Gothic and Manueline influences. The settlement of Valdevez was, until the 12th century, the seat of the territory of Ribeira-Lima, due to its strategic position between northern Portugal and Galicia. During the Middle Ages, the local administration began to concentrate in Arcos, which was (as its name implies) founded near the old bridge crossing the Vez River. There were some authors that referred to its first foral, issued by D. Afonso Henriques in 1129, but the only document was the Manueline letter. King D. Manuel issued the first foral (charter) to the town, resulting in the later-construction of the pillory, by master stonemason João Lopes. Until 1700, the pillory was in the centre of the municipality, but was transferred to Valeta, a site on the bank of the Vez River. During its \\"stay\\" in Valeta it was the centre of community life, with stories of young girls who washed clothes near the site, play or date, with a few notes transcribing: :Pelourinho da Valeta / vai-te deitar e dormir, / não sejas alcoviteiro / das criadas de servir :Pillory of Valeta / you will lie down and sleep, / do not pander / the maids to serve By 1706, the area was known as the settlement of the Viscounts of Vila Nova da Cerveira. In the square of the municipality, was a golden pillory, which was moved to the nearby riverbank. This site had a judge, three aldermen and prosecutor, six judicial notaries, a judge for orphans, clerk, bailiff, two porters, municipal clerk, and some officers presented by King and others by the Viscount. From the Memórias Paroquiais (dated 20 April 1758), abbot Miguel de Sousa described that the parish was part of the comarca of Valença. It had 135 neighbours and approximately 480 residents. By the initiative of the municipal president, Pedro Pereira de Sousa e Brito, in 1895 the pillory was placed in its current location. Architecture The pillory is situated in an isolated, urban position, in the historical centre of the town, in a square that is at a lower level then the southern facade of the parochial church. Nearby are two stone bunks. The pillory is a granite structure, composed of a shaft on a four-step quadrangle, with small torus and shaft. A thick column comprising three smaller, addorsed columns, surmounted with frieze and caption: :IOANS / LOPEZ / MEFEZ The capital is in the form of a bowl, with three shields of Portugal, interspersed with oval frames and surmounted by three rods. The three rods replicate the same alignment of small columns converge to an armillary spheres. Another, larger, decorates the group.

Like other Sienese painters, and different from the contemporary Florentine style, Alfei maintained a gothic and mystical style of painting. Biography Like many of lesser painters of the era, there is much confusion around his life and attributed works. There is in fact, no work known to be by his hand with documentary assurance. He was for many years only known as a name, but in the late 1940s, the art critic Roberto Longhi began to question the attribution of a large predella from the Basilica dell'Osservanza in Siena. Initially the predella had been attributed to Sassetta or Sano di Pietro (by Cesare Brandi).Basilica Osservanza website. In 2010, documents were found to argue for Sani di Pietro as the Master of the Osservanza Triptych. Of the documents relating to Alfei are that:Documenti per la storia dell'arte senese, Volume 2, by Gaetano Milanesi, 1854, page 421. *In 1454, he is sued for failing to complete the painting of a chapel for Ser Lorenzo di Giusu. *In 1456, he is at Castel-Mozo. *In 1474, he was paid for painting a chataletto. *In 1483, in Valdichiana, he was engaged in some designs. *In 1488, in Siena, he is aged impoverished and afflicted with gout.

He worked for Pope Pius II in 1460, for the diplomat Leonardo Benvoglienti, for the Ottieri della Ciaia family and for Sinolfo di Castellottieri. In 1455 the magistrates of Siena paid Alfei for work at Monte Argentario near Orbetello; works till recently attributed to Ambrogio Lorenzetti and to Sassetta.

After the Zhou conquered the Shang dynasty in 11th century BC, Kang Shu, a son of King Wen of Zhou and younger brother of King Wu of Zhou, was enfeoffed at the capital region of Shang, establishing the State of Wey. A descendant of Kang Shu was enfeoffed at Wulu (五鹿, northeast of modern Puyang, Henan), and this branch of the Wey royal house adopted Wulu as their surname, later shortened to Lu 鹿. Kang Shu is generally revered as the founding ancestor of the Lu 鹿 surname.

Wiener Hochquellenwasserleitung) is a major part of Vienna's water supply and was the first source of safe drinking water for that city. The 95 km long line was opened on 24 October 1873, after four years of construction. Today, it delivers 62 million cubic meters of water per year (53% of Vienna's total supply in 2007). The water comes from high springs in the Rax and Schneeberg areas in Southern Lower Austria and Styria.  History = Beginnings to 1910  The reason for its creation = Vienna's water supply originally came from private wells. In the absence of a functioning sewer system, the quality of the groundwater went from bad to worse, triggering disease and epidemics. Reinforced water pipes were built, but these primarily benefitted the wealthy and large institutions. Most of the population had to rely on spouts or fountains attached to wells. The first water pipe that provided greater coverage was built in 1803-1804, bringing water from Hütteldorf. Vienna was growing too fast for the supply to be sufficient so, in 1836, the Emperor Ferdinand Aqueduct was built. It provided artificially filtered water from the Danube Canal. Initially, the water quality was acceptable, but the effects of the filtering gradually diminished and the health risk returned. Demand also continued to exceed supply. During the late 1850s, several projects to divert water from other sources were proposed, and studies were made to calculate the amount of water that would be required. These studies considered not only drinking water, but industry, irrigation, road sprinkling, fountains and bathing facilities as well. = Search for a source = A primary consideration was that the water should originate at a high altitude, so that gravity, rather than pumps, would be sufficient to the task. The Traisen was considered first, and rejected, because of high water temperatures during the summer and concerns about its purity. The Pitten, Schwarza and the Leitha were subsequently rejected for similar reasons. The Fischa was rejected because of concerns about the companies that used the river as a power source and the possibility of contamination from ammonia-based fertilizers. Attention finally turned to the area between Rax, Schneeberg and Würflach. The data collected from these studies were summarized by the City Planning Authority and presented to the City Council on 31 July 1861. Later, on 1 December 1861, foreign and domestic engineering companies were invited to submit plans and bids for the proposed project. Twelve offers were presented and various sources were suggested; two of which focused on the Rax-Schneeberg area. = Establishment of the Water Supply Commission = Eduard Suess On 21 November 1862, the City Council established a twelve-member commission to carry out the necessary surveys and paperwork. Among the commission's members were Cajetan Felder (an entomologist), Ludwig Förster (an architect) and August Zang (a publisher). Eduard Suess (a geologist) was appointed to replace Förster upon the latter's death in 1863. In the spring of that year, the commission began a detailed examination of the proposed sites and projects. Their studies extended higher and higher, finally examining the area around Höllental, which they declared to be suitable for the project's purposes. The final \\"Report on the surveys of the Water Supply Commission of the Municipal Council of the City of Vienna\\" was written by Suess in 1864 and published by the Council. The report concluded that the three sources of Kaiserbrunnen, Stixenstein and Alta would supply high quality water and, even though it was longer than the route to Fischa, would be more cost-effective because no pump station would be necessary. The report was submitted to a group of experts and verified on 6 July 1864. The Imperial Society of Physicians gave their support to the final proposal and it was ratified by the Council on 12 July by a vote of 94 to 2. = The beginning of detailed planning = The reservoir at Rosenhügel Those involved in the planning were divided in two groups. The First Department was responsible for the source of the pipeline and the reservoir. The Second Department oversaw the pipeline route and work within the Vienna city limits. The work was done under the direction of Carl Junker, a civil engineer, and Karl Gabriel, the City Engineer. The plans were completed near the end of October in 1865 and put on public display at the Palais Augarten in December. Another panel of experts examined the plans and gave their approval in February, 1866. On May 25 that year, the plans were presented to the City Council for final approval and after a long debate, the project was authorized to proceed on 19 June. Having fulfilled the tasks assigned to it, the original Water Supply Commission was dissolved on 3 July and replaced by a new twenty- one member commission to oversee the actual construction. Most of the original commissioners were retained. The first construction permits were issued in July 1868. Objections were raised by local land owners and factory operators near the Schwarza, but were rejected by the Ministry of the Interior on 22 March 1869. = Acquisition of sources  Stixenstein  The Stixenstein source, near the Schloss Stixenstein at Sieding was owned by Count Ernst Karl von Hoyos-Sprinzenstein. The city of Vienna had notified him that they intended to acquire the property by right of public domain as early as 27 July 1864. Although he presented several conditions, none were considered onerous and the contract was approved by the Regional Court on 11 August 1868. In return for his \\"donation\\" he was made an Honorary Citizen of Vienna in 1873.  Kaiserbrunnen  The water tower at Kaiserbrunnen On 12 July 1864, a Delegation requested an audience with Emperor Franz Joseph I to request that he graciously transfer his interests in the Kaiserbrunnen to the City of Vienna. On 1 May 1865, at the opening ceremonies for the Ringstraße, the Emperor declared that he would present the Kaiserbrunnen to the city as a gift. The Ministry of Finance, however, made demands for indemnification and negotiations ensued. A decision on 29 November 1867 was followed by another audience with the Emperor, followed by more negotiations, which led to a contract being signed on 6 March 1868. = Construction of the first tunnel = After the issuance of construction permits, the bids were examined and the contract awarded to Antonio Gabrielli, a contractor from London, on 12 October 1869. The construction officially began on 21 April 1870. The Emperor himself turned over the first spadeful of dirt at Rosenhügel. In fact, construction had started on 6 December 1869, with blasting for the tunnel at Höllental. Due to some initial difficulties, the proposed completion date was re-estimated to be July, 1874. Gabrielli had awarded individual segments of the project to sub-contractor. The tunnel work had been given to Franz Schlögl, a Viennese architect, who was not up to the task and was removed from the project in August, 1870. Falling further behind from delays in deliveries, Gabrielli turned to the Minister of War to help with the tunnel but, instead of the 250 men he requested, he was assigned only 70 sappers. After an intervention by the City of Vienna, the War Ministry sent more men and the last tunnel section was completed on 8 December 1872. = Construction in Vienna = Baden Aqueduct south of Helenenstraße On 5 April 1870, the City Council approved a proposal by the Water Supply Commission and designated three companies to supply the pipes needed in urban areas. These were: the Prager Eisenindustrie-Gesellschaft (located in Kladno), Gambier et Cie. (from La Louvière, Belgium) and the Neuberg-Mariazeller Gewerkschaft. However, Gambier encountered difficulties in delivering their pipes due to the Franco- Prussian War, so most of their contract was transferred to nearby factories in Moravia. Many of the pipes were tested after being laid and were not up to standards, so the thickness of the pipe walls was increased and the general plan was revised to prevent water pressure from being too high in the low- lying areas. Due to a lack of water in 1873, Gabrielli was asked to accelerate his work so the supplies could be increased by no later than October. The City Council approved a special payment for this purpose. Construction was largely completed by August. The highlight of the opening ceremony on 24 October 1873 was the dedication of a jet fountain on the Schwarzenbergplatz by the Emperor.Stadt Wien: Rathauspark; retrieved, 19 Jänuary 2009) The entire pipe network, however, was not completed until July 1874. Private wells were examined for potential health hazards and, if any were found, the residences they served had to be connected to the new system and the old wells closed. By 1883, 80% of the homes in Vienna were receiving their water from the new pipes. By 1888, this had increased to 91%. Due to an increase in population, a pumping station had to be added at Breitensee in 1896. By 1899, another pumping station had been added on the Wienerbergstraße. In 1908 and 1909, the city found itself facing shortages again and, despite some opposition from industrial interests, took stop-gap measures to insure an adequate drinking water supply until the Second Vienna Mountain Spring Pipeline could be completed.  From 1910 to 1938  Map of the Vienna Mountain Spring Pipelines The metering chamber at Kaiserbrunn After the opening of the second pipeline in 1910, further investment in the first pipeline no longer seemed necessary. On 25 July 1914, during the First World War, both pipelines became state-protected companies by Imperial Decree. As a result, monitoring of the lines, which was normally undertaken by city employees and volunteers, became the responsibility of the Landsturm. After the war, the population of Vienna decreased by almost 326,000 and the ensuing economic depression reduced economic activity so the city found itself with a surplus of water that was delivered to adjacent communities such as Klosterneuburg, Schwechat, Brunn am Gebirge and others. But, during the summers of 1928 and 1929, the area experienced a drought, once again forcing a search for new sources of water. A temporary pumping station was established on the Naßbach, near its confluence with the Preinbach, but this water had to be chlorinated. That pump was eventually replaced by an electrically powered pump at the pipeline's headwaters. In 1930, improvements were made to the source at Kaiserbrunnen, including a \\"metering chamber\\" that would provide precise measurements of water flow.  1938 to 1945  Water consumption in Vienna rose sharply after 1939, slowing down only towards the end of 1944. By 1942, demand had exceeded supply. In the event that one of the lines might become disabled, groundwater stations and locks were built in the urban area. Water saving measures were, of course, already in effect as a result of the war. On 12 April 1944 an attack on the nearby airbase at Kottingbrunn caused collateral damage to the first pipeline. Far more serious were the results of an attack at Wöllersdorf in May, which damaged the line in several places. Bombing near Vienna caused damage to the aqueduct. Temporary repairs were attempted, often by local fire brigades. On 29 March 1945, a bombing raid by Russian aircraft caused severe damage at Neunkirchen. This remained unrepaired until after the war.  1945 until today  The site of the water tank at Neusiedl am Steinfeld The bomb craters near Neunkirchen had allowed large quantities of gravel to enter the system, causing erosion to the pipes. Cleaning and repair required several years, during which the canal had to be closed. The first major project after the pipeline was recommissioned was the construction of a major water storage facility at Neusiedl am Steinfeld. The foundation stone was laid on 21 November 1953 and the four-chambered water tank was fully operational by 25 April 1959. It can hold 150,000 cubic metres of water, making it the largest in Europe at that time. A few years later, another problem was posed by the construction of the Süd Autobahn (1961-1963), which crosses the first pipeline four times between Bad Vöslau and Bad Fischau. Precautions had to be taken to protect the pipeline from the potential effects of traffic accidents. With the establishment of the Schneealpenstollen (Alpine Snow Tunnel) in 1968, water from Styria was introduced into the pipeline system. The tunnel was then the largest in Europe and increased supplies by 20%.Die \\"Sieben Quellen\\" fließen für Wien.

This contribution was acknowledged when the University of Sydney awarded him an Honorary D Litt in 2008. He was appointed a member of the Order of Australia (AM) in 2012. Early life Ken Turner was born in Sydney on 14 August 1928. He was educated at a private infants school, then Earlwood Public School and Canterbury Boys High School. In 1945 he received a Department of Education scholarship to undertake an Arts degree at the University of Sydney. Graduating in 1948, he taught at Maitland Boys High School and at Newtown Technical School. He continued his University studies part-time and was awarded a B.Ec. in 1956 and M.Ec. in 1966. In 1958 he married Lorna McKenzie. They have two children, Robert (1960), and Catherine (1963). Academic career From 1957 to 1961 Turner lectured at Sydney Teachers’ College, while also undertaking some tutorials and lectures at the University’s Department of Government. In late 1961, Turner was appointed to the Government Department as senior tutor and became a lecturer in 1963. He was promoted to senior lecturer and then to associate professor. Ken Turner followed in the footsteps of Professors Henry Mayer and RN Spann in fostering the study of Australian and NSW politics. Much important new work resulted in what was then a neglected area. Turner’s main interests were the study of parliament, elections and political parties. His 1969 House of Review? was a ground-breaking study of the NSW Legislative Council and the theory of bicameralism.P Coleman, The Bulletin, 17 January 1970 When the Council was being reformed in the 1970s, Turner appeared before a Parliamentary Committee as an expert witness. With other colleagues, he made an influential contribution to the design of the scheme of public funding for elections adopted in NSW In 1985 came The Wran Model, another Department of Government project which Turner facilitated and co-edited (with Ernie Chaples and Helen Nelson). It remains the definitive account of NSW politics and elections in the 1970s and 80s. For many years Turner worked in the field of labour history. This resulted in A History of the Australian Labor Party in NSW, 1891–1991, co-authored with his long-time friend and collaborator Professor James Hagan. It was a model for such studies and added new insights by adopting a regional approach.DB Waterson, ‘[Review of] A History of the Australian Labor Party in NSW 1891–1991’, Labour History, vol 65, Nov 1993. As well as leaving an important legacy of published works, Turner played a major role as a teacher and mentor. For many decades, he taught first year Government at the University of Sydney and influenced generations of undergraduates. He was always generous in sharing his compendious knowledge and providing students and colleagues with ideas. Turner succeeded Professors Henry Mayer and Dick Spann as head of the Government Department, a position he held from 1974 to 1981. His common sense and wisdom were much valued at a turbulent time. Turner also made a major contribution to the University as a whole as an administrator, sitting on important committees. He was for many years sub-dean of the Faculty of Economics, eventually becoming dean. Retirement and after Turner retired at the end of 1988 but remained active as a researcher and writer. He became an Honorary research associate in the Government Department. In the 1990s, Turner was a key contributor to a joint project between the NSW Parliament and Sydney University which culminated in The People’s Choice: electoral politics in twentieth century NSW (edited by David Clune and Michael Hogan). In 2001, Premier Bob Carr appointed Turner to the Sesquicentenary of Responsible Government in NSW Committee. He played an influential role on the Committee and in three major Sesquicentenary works: The Premiers of NSW, 1856–2005 (co- edited with David Clune); The Worldly Art of Politics (co-edited with Michael Hogan); and The Governors of NSW, 1788–2010 (co-edited with David Clune).JR Nethercote, SMH, 2 April 2013. At the launch of the two volumes on the Premiers, former NSW Premier Neville Wran described Turner as 'the doyen of Labor historians' and commented that his grasp of history 'permeates every page'.NK Wran, Launch of The Premiers of NSW, Friday 31 March 2006, NSW Parliament, 2006 Turner subsequently served on the Governor Macquarie Bicentenary Committee in 2010.

Named after Kangleipak, the ancient name of Manipur, it was initially led by the communist ideologues — Ibohanbi and Ibopishak. The Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP) had been engaged in an armed struggle to achieve sovereignty for Manipur since the 1980s. Splinter factions The KCP has now been divided into numerous factions, of which the known are: #Kangleipak Communist Party (Marxist-Maoist / Ibungo Ngangom) #Kangleipak Communist Party (Prithvi) #Kangleipak Communist Party (Mangang) #Kangleipak Communist Party (Military Council) #Kangleipak Communist Party (Maoist) #Kangleipak Communist Party (Lamphel) #Kangleipak Communist Party (Sunil Meitei) #Kangleipak Communist Party (Mobile Task Force) #Kangleipak Communist Party (Lamyanba Khuman) #Kangleipak Communist Party (Loyallakpa) #Kangleipak Communist Party (Noyon) #Kangleipak Communist Party (City Meitei) Background This faction of the Kangleipak Communist Party came into existence in the late 2000s following the failure of certain party leaders to commit themselves to Marxism and Maoism. The incumbent chairman of its Politburo Standing Committee (highest decision-making body), Ibungo Ngangom, who used to head the Information and Public Relations Department of the Kangleipak Communist Party, was the main force behind the emergence of this faction, which has now become the most prominent one among the KCP factions. Though it came up as a separate group around 2010, it still sticks to 14 April 1980 as its rising day, because of the fact that the Kangleipak Communist Party was originally established on this date. Ideology The Kangleipak Communist Party under the leadership of Ibungo Ngangom is a group that follows Marxism and Maoism. But what makes this group a unique communist party is the fact that its chairman has often spoken about ideological flexibility and adopting the so-called bamboo policy. According to Ibungo Ngangom, communism is a living ideology and nobody must hesitate to 'adjust' in order to make it realistic and successful. He also talked about trying to achieve a higher level of compatibility between Marxism and Maoism. The group especially promotes the principle 'from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs'. Organisational Structure The Kangleipak Communist Party (Marxist-Maoist) under the leadership of Ibungo Ngangom has two main organs: Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), which is a combination of its legislative and judiciary bodies; and General Administrative Council (GAC), which is the executive branch of the group. Politburo Standing Committee The Politburo Standing Committee consists of Ibungo Ngangom (Chairman), Amumacha Mangang (Deputy Chairman), Thoiba Meetei (Senior Member), Wangba Angomcha (Senior Member), Angousana Moi-rangcha (Senior Member), James Paomei (Member), Sanatombi Chanu Lourembam (Member), Moramba Meetei (Member),Tomthin Mangang (Member), Sanatomba (Member), Wangthoi (Member). Initially, it was a five-member committee. But it was expanded into an eleven- member committee during its recent bi-annual conference. General Administrative Council Following the expansion of the politburo standing committee, the general administrative council of the outfit has also been reshuffled as Ibungo Ngangom (Secretary-in-Chief, also heading Foreign Affairs Department, Fund-raising Department and Central Intelligence Wing), Amumacha Mangang (Deputy Secretary-in-Chief), Wangba Angomcha (Secretary, Public Affairs Department), Angousana Moirangcha ( Secretary, Finance & Budgetary Affairs Department), Sanatombi Chanu (Secretary, Information & Public Relations Department), James Paomei (previously Secretary, Public Affairs Department, he will now be Central Liaison Officer, Intra- Departmental Liaison Centre), Thoiba Meetei (previously Secretary, Finance & Budgetary Affairs Department, he will now be Auditor-in-Chief, Audit Commission), Sanatomba Khumancha (previously Commander, Bir Tikendrajit Cadre, i.e. Special Contingency Response Wing, he is now Commander, Paona Cadre, i.e. Jungle Guerrilla Warfare Wing), Moramba Meetei (previously Commander, Paona Cadre, i.e. Jungle Guerrilla Warfare Wing, he is now Commander, Thangal Cadre, i.e. Urban Guerrilla Warfare Wing), Tomthin Mangang (previously Commander, Thangal Cadre, i.e. Urban Guerrilla Warfare Wing, he is now Commander, Bir Tikendrajit Cadre, i.e. Special Contingency Response Wing), Wangthoi ( previously Chief Intelligence Officer, Central Intelligence Wing, he is now Secretary, Capitalistic Concerns Regulation and Taxation Cell), announced the outfit. Legal status The Kangleipak Communist Party (Marxist-Maoist) is an organization that has been continuously banned under section 35 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 by the Government of India for 'waging war' against the Indian State. Relations with other groups The Foreign Affairs Department of the group, which is led by none other than its PSC Chairman has been endeavouring to establish contacts and relations with many communist parties throughout the world. The group is also said to have established some links with certain Maoist groups of Nepal, though it has not openly admitted it. Moreover, in a recent press release, the group has expressed its willingness to cooperate and coordinate with the Communist Party of India (Maoist). According to some sources with close links with the group, it has also decided to work together with other anti-India separatist groups of states like Assam, Tripura and Meghalaya. Ban on the Celebrations of Indian Independence Day and Republic Day in Manipur The Kangleipak Communist Party (Marxist-Maoist) has \\"imposed\\" a so-called \\"permanent ban\\" on the celebrations of Indian Independence Day and Republic Day in Manipur. According to this group, Kangleipak was \\"annexed\\" by the Union of India under the guise of the Manipur Merger Agreement, which was signed by the then King of Kangleipak, who no longer had any authority to ink such an agreement as Kangleipak was already a democratic society under the command of an elected body of legislators. So it has been struggling to \\"reclaim\\" the \\"robbed sovereignty\\" of Kangleipak (Manipur). Kangleipak Communist Party (Maoist) In 2009, numerous comrades of the KCP coalesced and organised a convention, and reconstructed the party's Central Committee. Forthwithly after the plenum, they named the faction as \\"Kangleipak Communist Party (Maoist),\\" which has now evolved into the Maoist Communist Party of Manipur. However, the Kangleipak Communist Party led by Ibungo Ngangom has emerged as the leading group at least in terms of ideological positions and changes brought about within the group following his release from prison on 4 April 2015 after spending about 12 consecutive years in various prisons in India, including Tihar Jail. According to recent press releases of this group, led by Ibungo Ngangom, the group's primary goal is not only to liberate Kangleipak (Manipur) but also establish communism in Kangleipak through the scientific socialism of Karl Marx. This makes this group a unique communist party of Manipur.

The length of the church was increased and a balcony was added. In 1859, foundations for the school were laid. In the 1860s and 1870s the local Catholic population continued to rise and the church was again extended. The presbytery was moved to a separate house so that the church could be extended into the previous one. In 1878, a lady chapel, designed by Joseph Hansom was added to St Austin's. Daughter Church In December 1877, the parish need to expand, because numbers were increasing and it was too spread out geographically. It was decided that the Jesuits would build a new chapel, in South Ossett so the Catholics there would not have to travel to Wakefield for Mass every Sunday. The church was St Ignatius and was dedicated to Ignatius of Loyola. It became a church and a parish in 1910 when it was handed over the Diocese of Leeds.

The white, wooden church was built in an octagonal style in 1863 using designs by the architect Christian Henrik Grosch. The church seats about 320 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1323, but it was not new that year. It is not known when the original stave church was built here, but it could have been as early as the 12th century. In 1610, the old church was torn down and replaced by a new timber-framed church. The timber church from 1610 is shown in a painting from 1839 (see media gallery below). In 1696-1698, a sacristy was added to the east of the choir. This church was part of the Leikanger parish until 1 March 1849 when the new Balestrand parish was established. Tjugum Church was to be the main church for the parish, so a new, larger church was commissioned to be built. So in 1863, the old church was torn down and replaced by a new octagonal church on the same site. The new building was consecrated on 29 October 1863 by the local Dean Thomas Erichsen.

The only known species is Cipactlichthys scutatus. Discovery and etymology Cipactlichthys scutatus is known from two fossils discovered in the Tlayua Formation near the town of Tepexi de Rodríguez, in Puebla, Mexico. The Tlayua Formation, is Albian (Early Cretaceous) in age, interpreted as an epicontinental marine deposit. Due to its high quality preservation and abundance of fish fossils, the formation is considered one of the most important sources of Cretaceous fishes in Mexico. The genus name is a combination of Cipactli, the Aztec mythological sea monster said to be part fish and part reptile, and ichthys, Greek for \\"fish\\". The specific epithet scutatus is Latin for shield, referring to the large dorsal and ventral scutes.  Description  Cipactlichthys is an elongate fish, approximately 130 mm in total length, or 100 mm in standard length. Its dermal bones and scales are covered in ganoine and decorated with tubercles and ridges. The jaw extends to behind the rear end of the orbit. The pectoral fins are relatively long, with the first ray extending to the anterior edge of the pelvic fins. The caudal fin is forked and homocercal (upper and lower lobes of equal length). The dorsal fin contains at least 8 fin rays. The anal fin is larger than the dorsal fin and also bears at least 8 rays. The scales vary greatly in size and shape, with a series of large plate-like scutes along the dorsal and ventral midline behind the dorsal and anal fin.  Classification  Cipactlichthys is classified in the clade Halecomorphi due to possession of a crescent-shaped preopercle and the involvement of the symplectic bone in jaw articulation. However, it has not yet been assigned to an order or family, instead considered a Halecomorph of uncertain placement (incertae sedis). The only living Halecomorph is the bowfin, Amia calva, but this group has a diverse fossil record. A phylogenetic analysis placed Cipactlichthys as sister to a clade containing Amiiformes and the extinct order Ionoscopiformes.

It is located approximately west of Chandler. The large Hohokam settlement was situated within the southern Salado valley. Geography Los Muertos is situated west of Chandler and near Tempe, in the Salt River valley of southern Arizona. It covers an area greater than along the borders of a canal or artificial river, measuring almost . The Los Muertos and Pueblo de las Acequias (\\"City of the Canals\\") ruins are approximately apart. History In 1887, Frank Hamilton Cushing, leader of the Hemenway Southwestern Archaeological Expedition, explored the ruins of an early people, a place he called \\"El Pueblo de los Muertos\\"—\\"The City of the Dead\\"— in the center of which he uncovered many large communal houses, and beyond them found the remains of more sparsely-settled suburbs extending for . The largest of these houses was bigger than Casa Grande. It was surrounded by smaller edifices, and the entire group was enclosed by an adobe wall, which was built as protection against enemies as well as to insure privacy to its occupants. There were windows and portholes in the outer walls of the houses, but there were no doors. The dwellers entered and exited by means of ladders against the outer wall and trap doors in the roofs leading to the rooms within. The walls of the houses were made of adobe, created by piling on more and more clay until the top was reached. The walls of the house were of sufficient thickness to insure protection against hostile tribes as well as the fierce summer heat of the desert. In the better-finished houses, the clay surface of the inner walls was rubbed by hand until it attained a high polish. The rafters between the stories were made of small tree trunks upon which lay a layer of reeds, which in turn was covered with a coating of cement-like clay. In the yards or streets of Los Muertos, Cushing found public ovens and large cooking pits lined with clay or natural cement. The largest of these pits was across and deep. Within the houses, Cushing found the remains of dishes, utensils, and pottery; also, there were stones for grinding corn, stone axes, hammers and hoes, cotton cloth, skin-dressing implements, bone awls, and several other articles of the chase and of war and of domestic and religious usage. There were various little images, some not over , carved from stone. These dated to the Stone Age . In the corners of certain rooms at Los Muertos were the remains of persons buried in vaults. Others of their dead were first incinerated, and the remaining ash and charred bones were interred in urns made of pottery with inverted saucer-like lids. Two of the skeletons found in Los Muertos were nearly in length; most of them, however, were short in stature. Demographics John Wesley Powell, the director of the U.S. Bureau of Ethnology, estimated that Los Muertos had at least 13,000 inhabitants.

Nicknamed \\"Honest Pete\\" because he refused to take city funds from financial decisions made as Treasurer, he broke from the tradition of his predecessors. He was the first Pole to be elected to such positions in the city. He was a major organizer of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, and worked as president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America, in order to regain the Poles' loyalty to the Roman Catholic Church.  Early life and Civil War  Kiołbassa came from the Silesian village of Świbie with his family when he was 17 years old, arriving in the town of Panna Maria, Texas, which was a new Polish immigrant settlement. He spoke Polish and German fluently from his youth, he did not speak any English until he arrived in the United States, when, upon his arrival, he learned English and Spanish. In 1862, he joined the Confederate Army, and was captured in 1863. After his capture, the Union Army recruited him to their side, making him a sergeant; he was promoted to sergeant major and then captain during the Civil War. After the Civil War, he moved to Chicago and served on the police force. Because of his polyglot abilities and excellent handwriting, he advanced to sergeant and then secretary to the Chief of Police. Initially, he was a member of the Republican Party. His support for Ulysses S. Grant during the 1872 election was documented in an editorial he wrote to Sobota, where he urged Poles to vote for Grant. After this election, he switched his affiliation to the Democratic Party, organizing support among Polish Americans. In 1888, he ran as a Democrat for alderman of Chicago's 16th Ward, which contained a highly Polish constituency, against Republican August Kowalski, another Pole. Their competition split the Polish vote, and he lost the election to Kowalski.  Roman Catholic Union  Kiołbassa was elected president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union in 1888, and used much of his political expertise to advance the Polish Catholic community. Kiołbassa helped organize the Roman Catholic Parish of St. Stanislaus Kostka in Chicago, which later became the largest Polish parish in the U.S. Reportedly, organizing the church alongside his police duties had been so difficult, he took a year off, in 1871–72, and moved back to Panna Maria, Texas. Kiołbassa's presidency oversaw growing divisions between Polish American Catholics and the Church. Victor Greene, in For God and Country: The Rise of Polish and Lithuanian Consciousness in America, posits that Kiołbassa was solidly in the \\"religionist\\" camp of Polish immigrants; whereas many felt oppressed, and rebelled against what they saw as Anglo-German-Irish domination of the Catholic Church in America, he was a solid supporter of the Roman Catholic Church, and saw no reason to schism from church leadership. His work expanding and developing the St. Stanislaus Kostka church served to placate many of the Poles who wanted to break away.  Treasurer and later life  Kiołbassa served in the Customs Department, and in 1891, he ran for Chicago Treasurer, as a part of a slate of Democratic candidates, making him the first Pole in that position. Banks were not cooperative with him, refusing to lend him a necessary $15 million bond without proper backing. He found backing from his political allies and the Polish American community. When offered the choice on what to do with the interest, he broke tradition from his predecessors, who would keep the interest from successful financial decisions for themselves. Kiołbassa earned the nickname \\"Honest Pete\\" because he chose to turn the $44,000 in interest back to the city, fulfilling his campaign promise.Tribune. April 9, 1891. Kiolbassa featured in the Chicago Eagle, 1901 Kiołbassa was urged to run for governor of Illinois after his term as Treasurer. He did not believe the state would vote for a foreign-born governor, despite the successful election of German-born John Peter Altgeld. He became alderman in 1896, narrowly defeating John F. Smulski. In his later life, he became commissioner of public works and buildings commissioner, where he became entangled in controversies regarding poor construction across the city. His public image tarnished, Chicago mayor Carter Harrison Jr. defended Kiołbassa, saying he had been \\"scandalously wronged\\" by problems that occurred under his predecessors' watch. Kiołbassa tendered his resignation, never to return to elected office.

The white, stone church was built in a basilica style between the years 1280 and 1300. The church seats about 210 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1330, but it was not new that year. The church was likely built between 1280 and 1300 by an unknown architect. The main body of the church measures . The current tower on the church dates back to 1715. This was the church for the parish of Kvamsøy until it was replaced in 1903 by the newly built Sæle Church. Since the new church was built, Kvamsøy Church is no longer used regularly. Instead there are only two services held each year: one in May and one on Olsok. Other special services such as funerals and weddings can be held there when requested. There is no electric heating in the church, so it is not used at all from October until May. The church is a protected historical site.

A fishing license (US), fishing licence or fishing permit is a regulatory or legal mechanism to control fishing. Licensing is one mechanism of fisheries management and may be required for either commercial or recreational fishing. Historical licensing Chinese fishing license from the Qing era in the Baojiashu jiyao (1838) In 1765, the Chinese Qing dynasty government required all fishing boat operators to obtain a fishing license under the aojia system that regulated coastal populations. The Dan boat people of Guangdong had to acquire a fishing license as early as 1729. The wooden license issued by the government was to be displayed on the bow or stern of a boat. The information on the license consisted of the name and age of the boat's owner, the ship's status as either a fishing or commercial vessel, the home port of the boat, crew and family members on board, the date the license was issued, and the registration number of the license. Types by country Depending on the jurisdiction, licenses or permits may be required by a government, a property owner, or both. United Kingdom The government requires a rod licence for anyone over the age of 12 who fishes in England, Wales or the Border Esk area in Scotland for salmon, trout, freshwater fish, smelt or eels. In addition, anyone who fishes in a non-estuarine stream, lake, or canal needs a permit from the owner of the fishing rights to the water body, which might be a local angling club, a landowner with riparian rights, or an organization such as the Canal & River Trust. Ireland In Ireland, rights to fish in non-tidal freshwater also are owned either by the government or by private entities such as angling club. The ownership of fishing rights in Ireland derives from the confiscation of lands by the British Crown in the 17th century; the boundaries of fishing rights areas typically follow the boundaries of estates granted by the Crown. United States The U.S. state of Oregon instituted a requirement for commercial fishing licenses in 1899, the same year that the state's sturgeon fishery had collapsed due to over-harvesting. Oregon began requiring recreational fishing licenses in 1901. Indiana began issuing hunting licenses in 1901 and added fishing privileges to its hunting license in 1913. The state of Pennsylvania first issued recreational fishing licenses in 1919. Licenses were required only for nonresidents, and only 50 licenses were issued that first year. In 1922, when the state first required licenses for state residents, over 2,700 nonresident licenses and over 200,000 resident licenses were sold.  License free fishing  Some countries don't require a license for recreational sea fishing, provided that certain rules in regard to fish size, numbers and total catch are followed.  Belgium  Recreational fishing in the sea does not require a license in certain spots. Size limits need to be followed. Also need to have a freshwater permit when fishing on certain seadocks  Cyprus  Sea angling and spear fishing without diving equipment is allowed with no licence. Multiple species including seals, dolphins and turtles are protected.  Estonia  Estonians have a life-long right to fish with one simple hand line in waters owned by the state and local governments, provided that regulations about species, sizes and seasons are followed.  New Zealand  No license is necessary for recreational sea fishing. There are many detailed regulations about fish species, size limits, fishing methods and prohibited areas.  Norway  Sea fishing from the coast and from the boat is free for both residents and visitors, although there are minimum fish rules and other regulations.  Sweden  For fishing in public coastal waters (Baltic sea and the west coast) no license is necessary. Foreign citizens are also allowed to fish in these waters without a license, but only with hand held gear. License free fishing is legal along the sea coast (in many cases also on private land along the coast) and in Sweden's five largest lakes – Vänern, Vättern, Hjälmaren, Mälaren and Storsjön.. In the rest of the country, fishing without a license is not permitted and several thousand fishing areas exist, each with their individual fishing permits and local regulations. Fishing permits are available in most of Sweden's fresh waters, but not all.  United Kingdom  Fishing licence for sea fishing is not required in most of the places in the United Kingdom. For salmon and sea trout game licence is required regardless of location. In places where saltwater and freshwater cross over the regulations are complicated and licence may be required.

Richards and wife Robyn, and Erin J. Richards, all of Bryan. Services were held at the large Central Baptist Church in Bryan. He is interred at Bryan City Cemetery. Current Bryan Mayor Jason P. Bienksi referred to Stabler as \\"a true public servant [who] always put the betterment of the city before his own needs. He brought tremendous business acumen to the city council and was hugely instrumental in bringing about a renewed business interest in downtown Bryan in particular. He will be sorely missed. ... The Bryan-College Station Eagle staff writer Beth Brown reflected on Stabler's legacy: \\"[More than] a decade removed from his last term [as mayor of Bryan], Stabler's fingerprints are still all over the city—in the revitalized downtown, in the booming Traditions area, and even in the city council election process.\\" References Category:1945 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Mayors of places in Texas Category:Texas city council members Category:People from Bryan, Texas Category:Bryan High School (Bryan, Texas) alumni Category:Texas A&M; University alumni Category:University of Houston alumni Category:Businesspeople from Texas Category:American Presbyterians Category:Deaths from cancer in Texas ","title":"Lonnie Stabler"},{"id":"41858083","title":"Destin Daniel Cretton"},{"id":"41858111","text":"Connection Distributing Co. v. Holder, 557 F.3d 321 (6th Cir. 2009) is a case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that the record-keeping provisions of the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act did not violate the First Amendment. Section 2257 of the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act requires those who create sexually explicit materials to maintain records of their model's age and identities, as a measure against child pornography. Connection Distributing, a publisher of swinging magazines, challenged the constitutionality of the statute, as individuals who posted on Connection's magazines would also be required to create and maintain such records, and provide them to the publisher. In 2009, the Sixth Circuit ruled en banc that the provisions were not unconstitutional, while a panel of the court had decided in 2007 that the statute violated the First Amendment.  Background  Connection Distributing is a publisher of magazines devoted to swinging. The magazines acts as a venue for people interested in swinging to share their interests, preferences, and availability, and principally consist of advertisements that allow self- promotion by individuals. Individuals do not mention their full names in the advertisements, and 85-90% of advertisers do not reveal their faces. However, they are required to share their names, addresses and phone numbers with the publisher. Connection forwards responses to ads for a fee and allows subscribers to call a 900-number service to contact advertisers. Section 2257 of the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act places record-keeping requirements on \\"primary\\" and \\"secondary\\" producers of actual sexually explicit material. Primary producers, who create a visual representation of sexually explicit materials, must create and maintain records of the performers' age and identity. Secondary producers are those who publish sexually explicit materials, or upload such content to a website, or manage the content of the website; a secondary producer may meet the requirement by obtaining a copy of the primary producer's records. A regulated entity that fails to follow these requirements is subject to criminal penalties. The Act makes it a felony not to comply with these requirements, and a producer convicted of violating the Act may be fined and subject to as many as five years in prison. Section 2257 is part of the Congress' effort to protect children from the pornographic industry. Prior to 1988, Congress tried to prevent the pornographic industry from exploiting children in two ways. First, it proscribed all pornography, whether or not it involved children. Second, it banned all other pornography involving children under the age of 18. However, research showed that these two measures did not effectively protect children mainly because the industry's inclination to use youthful-looking actresses, which made it difficult to find out whether children were used in obscene publications or movies. Therefore, in 1988, the Congress enacted the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act. And section 2257 of the Act laid out the requirements set forth above.  Procedural background  In 1995, Connection filed a complaint, challenging the record-keeping provisions of Section 2257. In Connection Distrib. Co. v. Reno, 154 F.3d 281, 285 (6th Cir. 1998), the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court's denial of Connection's motion for preliminary injunction against the enforcement of Section 2257 and 28 C.F.R. § 75 (the related administrative law). On remand, the district court granted summary judgment against Connection. A panel of the Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded the case such that it could be reconsidered in light of recent Supreme Court precedents. = District court opinion = After the Sixth Circuit panel remanded the case, Connection filed an amended complaint, again seeking a preliminary injunction, while the government sought summary judgment. The district court denied the preliminary injunction and granted summary judgment to the government. = Court of appeals three-judge panel opinion = At the panel stage of the case, in Connection Distrib. Co. v. Keisler, the judges found that the record-keeping requirements of Section 2257 were overly broad and therefore violated the First Amendment. In the overbreadth issue it raised, the panel observed that the statute seemed to apply to private couples who create and keep sexually explicit images in their homes. The court held that the statute was facially invalid, and reversed the district court's judgment, directing it to enter summary judgment for Connection.  Court of appeals en banc opinion  The Sixth Circuit addressed en banc the First Amendment claims made by the plaintiffs, first as an as- applied challenge by Connection to the record-keeping provisions of Section 2257, then as a facial challenge to the same statute. The court also considered whether the statute violated the Fifth Amendment's Self- Incrimination Clause as the plaintiffs claimed. The majority opinion written by Judge Jeffrey Sutton affirmed the district court's order granting summary judgment to the government, while six judges dissented, four of them writing dissenting opinions.  First Amendment claims  As-applied challenge = In its as-applied attack, Connection argued that the Child Protection Enforcement Act's record-keeping and disclosure provisions suppressed the free expression of Connection and its subscribers wishing to place sexually explicit advertisements in its magazines. The court disagreed, stating that the law was content-neutral, and therefore was subject to intermediate scrutiny, and not the more rigorous strict scrutiny, in deciding whether the statute violated the First Amendment. The court made this decision on the basis that the law addressed underage pornography issues, which were \\"secondary effects\\" of the expression, and did not address the effect of its content on its audience. As such, the court held that the record-keeping requirements of the statute could be justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech. Having determined that intermediate scrutiny applied in this challenge, the court then found that Section 2257 survived scrutiny, arguing that protecting children is a substantial government interest, and that universal age-verification is a reasonably tailored measure for many reasons. It rejected Connection's claim that the requirements placed barriers on the advertisers' interests in engaging in anonymous speech, stating that the claim was not credible, as Connection already required advertisers to submit their names, addresses, and phone numbers when placing an ad. When Connection remarked that Section 2257 made the information available to the government upon request, the court replied that \\"[the advertisers] have no more to complain about than every taxpayer in the country.\\" In dissent, Judge Karen Nelson Moore maintained that strict scrutiny should govern the as-applied challenge. In reply, Sutton's majority opinion stated that Connection did not urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to the case, and that the reasons given in the opinion justified the decision. = Facial challenge = As part of the facial challenge to the record-keeping requirements of Section 2257, Connection argued that the law would be unconstitutional as applied to a magazine of mature adult models, as it would be broader than is required, given the models would be clearly and visibly not minors. The court rejected this argument as a basis for invalidating Section 2257, stating that \\"Connection at most has identified a discrete application of the statute that may be problematic,\\" and that Connection failed to show substantial overbreadth required for facially invalidating the statute. In dissent, Judge Cornelia Groefsema Kennedy remarked that there were costs in requiring case-by-case adjudication, as some individuals who are wrongfully chilled from speaking may decline to seek remedy, as litigation is time- consuming, and can be expensive. Kennedy also argued that the absence of a prior application of the statute to private couples who create and keep sexually explicit material should not doom the facial-overbreadth challenge.  Fifth Amendment claims  The 2003 amendment to Section 2257 allows the government to use the records that must be maintained as evidence to other violations than only Section 2257. The three individual plaintiffs challenged the validity of the statute under the Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause, as these records could implicate them in crimes. The court refused to resolve the merits of this claim on the basis that it was not ripe. The court noted that the claim was not fit for decision, as the government had not attempted to inspect any of Connection's records so far.  Subsequent developments  In 2009, the Supreme Court denied the petition to reconsider the en banc decision of the Sixth Circuit. The decision is significant in maintaining that the record-keeping requirements of the Section 2257 are constitutional, and in its extended discussion of the overbreadth doctrine. The decision has been strongly criticized by the adult entertainment industry. The Electronic Frontier Foundation states it is currently working with the Free Speech Coalition to challenge the 2257 regulations, and filed an amicus curiae brief in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

Built in the 1850s, it is named for an early resident who served as Paducah's mayor and presided over numerous civic improvements. One of the city's few Greek Revival houses predating the 1860s, it sits on the field of a battle that resulted in the destruction of most of the houses around it. Once operated as a museum for Paducah resident Alben W. Barkley, it has been named a historic site. Occupants When constructed in 1852, it was the home of William Smedley, owner of a wharfboat on Paducah's Ohio River landing and of a boat-supply dealership. It was later purchased by David A. Yeiser, a pharmacist and politician; during his thirteen years as mayor, the city constructed its first sewers, placed its first electric lights along the streets, and paved some of its most important streets.Holland, Richard L. National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Lower Town Neighborhood District. National Park Service, 1980-11-10. After a period of deterioration, the Yeiser House underwent restoration and was converted into a museum under the operation of Paducah's Young Historians Association.Cherry, Robert C. National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Mayor David A. Yeiser House. National Park Service, 1972-12-27. Composed of students from the local high school and middle school, the adult-guided group created exhibits and interpreted the museum for visitors. The museum's focus was Paducah resident Alben Barkley, who served as Vice President of the United States under Harry S. Truman; among its exhibits were Barkley's hat and vice-presidential desk, along with photographs of him meeting individuals such as the Pope. Although named the Alben W. Barkley Museum, its exhibits were not completely dedicated to the vice-president; a smaller section was devoted to Paducah native Linn Boyd, a four-year Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Architectural history Paducah annexed the Lower Town neighborhood in 1836. The neighborhood's built environment is highly varied, ranging from the earlier Greek Revival style to the later Queen Anne, and also including numerous vernacular structures such as shotguns. Very few of the buildings predate the 1860s: during the Civil War, the Battle of Paducah was fought in the neighborhood. Confederate invaders sought to attack the nearby Union- controlled Fort Anderson, and after the invaders were repulsed, the Union commander ordered that the nearby houses be destroyed in order to deny future invaders the opportunity of approaching the fort by sneaking through the houses. Chief among the few surviving pre-war buildings on the battlefield is the Yeiser House; like most of the other survivors, it is Greek Revival in style, although it differs from most contemporary Kentucky houses because of the sheltered porch on its facade. Structure One story tall, the Yeiser House is a brick structure with a shallow hip roof pierced by a pair of chimneys on the roofline. Its walls, fully thick, are divided into three bays on the facade. Both Greek Revival and Italianate styling are present: ornamental brackets form a cornice for the roof of the front porch, which is supported by four square columns of brick; the porch is approximately deep and wide. Located in the facade is the main entrance, framed by sidelights, a transom window, and a pair of elaborate pilasters. The Yeiser House's appearance from the street is virtually identical to its original appearance. From the rear, the appearance is substantially different: during the 1940s, a porch on the western side of the house was enclosed and made part of the house, and one of the original chimneys were removed. Greater differences were made at the same time to the interior: two fireplaces were destroyed, the bathroom was updated, and the furniture was replaced. Preservation In March 1973, the Yeiser House was added to the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its architecture and because of its connection to Yeiser. It was the first McCracken County location to be given this designation, although the Market House downtown was listed approximately three months later. Among the twenty-eight other National Register locations in the county is the Lower Town Neighborhood District, which encompasses part or all of eighteen city blocks in the neighborhood; the Yeiser House is among the most important of the contributing properties in the historic district. Despite the historic status of its building, the Alben W. Barkley Museum is no longer in existence: a single history teacher had supported the museum with both personal efforts and finances, and after the money ran out in 2008, the museum closed. Board members announced the closure at the beginning of August; the city bought the building, and the contents were split up, with some going to the museum in the Market House and others going to other museums.\\"Alben Barkley Museum in Paducah Closing\\", Evansville Courier & Press, 2008-08-01.

As a university art museum, the Grey Art Gallery functions to collect, preserve, study, document, interpret, and exhibit the evidence of human culture. While these goals are common to all museums, the Grey distinguishes itself by emphasizing art's historical, cultural, and social contexts, with experimentation and interpretation as integral parts of programmatic planning. Thus, in addition to being a place to view the objects of material culture, the Gallery serves as a museum-laboratory in which a broader view of an object's environment enriches our understanding of its contribution to civilization. In 1974, Abby Weed Grey established the Grey Art Gallery (originally known as the Grey Art Gallery and Study Center) at New York University, both as a permanent home for her art collection and to promote international artistic exchange in an academic setting. The museum opened to the public in 1975. The Abby Weed Grey Collection of Modern Asian and Middle Eastern Art at NYU comprises some 700 works produced by artists from countries as diverse as Japan, Thailand, India, Kashmir, Nepal, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, and Israel. Mrs. Grey's vision was bold and simple: one world through art. Believe that art, as a universal language, could serve as a potent vehicle for knowledge, communication, and understanding, Mrs. Grey formed this unique collection while traveling in Asia and the Middle East in the 1960s and '70s. The Abby Weed Grey Collection constitutes the largest institutional holdings of modern Iranian and Turkish art outside those countries. The Grey Art Gallery also oversees the art collection of New York University. Founded in 1958 with the acquisition of Francis Picabia's Resonateur (1922) and Fritz Glarner's Relational Painting (1949–50), the NYU Art Collection comprises approximately 5,000 works, mainly dating from the 19th and 20th centuries, such as Pablo Picasso's Bust of Sylvette (1967), currently installed at University Village (Manhattan); Joseph Cornell's Chocolat Menier (1952); and works by Henri Matisse, Joan Mirò, and Ilya Bolotowsky, as well as Romare Bearden, Arshile Gorky, Adolph Gottlieb, Kenneth Noland, Jane Freilicher, Ad Reinhardt, and Alex Katz, among many others. History= History of the Building  The Grey Art Gallery's location is rich in cultural history. The gallery is housed in the Silver Center (formerly Main Building), on the site on NYU's original home, the legendary University Building (1835–94), where many famous artists and writers, including Samuel Colt, Winslow Homer, George Inness, and Henry James, worked. It was also here that Professor Samuel F. B. Morse established the first academic art department in the U.S. Between 1927 and 1942, the space now occupied by the Grey Art Gallery hosted A. E. Gallatin's Gallery (later Museum) of Living Art—the first American museum exclusively devoted to modernist art. In exhibiting work by Pablo Picasso, Fernand Léger, Joan Miró, Kazimir Malevich, Piet Mondrian, Jean Arp, and artists associated with the American Abstract Artists group, Gallatin created a forum for intellectual exchange and a place where visitors could view the latest developments in art. NYU lacked a permanent museum until 1975, when a generous gift from Mrs. Abby Weed Grey enabled the historic venue's renovation and improvement of the historic venue, and the doors reopened as the Grey Art Gallery and Study Center in 1975.  History of the Gallery  Founder and patron of the Grey Art Gallery, Mrs. Abby Weed Grey collected some 700 works of modern art on her travels throughout Asia and the Middle East. A native of Saint Paul, Minnesota and a graduate of Vassar College, Mrs. Grey established the Ben and Abby Grey Foundation to sponsor artists. She called for a more complex understanding of works by contemporary artists around the world, acknowledging their interest in local popular and folk forms as well as interactions with modernism. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Mrs. Grey undertook curatorial projects such as Fourteen Contemporary Iranians (1962–65) and Turkish Art Today (1966–70), each of which toured the United States; Communication Through Art (1964), which opened simultaneously in Istanbul, Tehran, and Lahore, before traveling throughout the eastern Mediterranean, Asia, and eastern Africa; and One World Through Art. By 1979, Mrs. Grey had become one of American's prominent collectors of Asian and Middle Eastern art. Mrs. Grey served on the Board of Trustees of The Minnesota Society of Fine Arts (1967–1973) and the Minneapolis College of Art and Design’s Board of Overseers (1964–1983). She endowed the Grey Fellowship in Museum Studies at the Walker Art Center, and in 1979, established and endowed The Grey Fine Arts Library and Study Center, a resource in NYU's Department of Art History (formerly Department of Fine Arts).  Collections = Abby Weed Grey Collection of Modern Asian and Middle Eastern Art  The gallery was endowed by Abby Weed Grey, who also donated some 700 works of modern art that she acquired during her frequent travels in Asia and the Middle East. Mrs. Grey was especially supportive of Iranian art, which comprises one-fifth of her collection at NYU. She also donated significant holdings of works by artists from Turkey and India. Many of the artists whose works she collected adapted their culture's indigenous aesthetic traditions to contemporary circumstances, and they often blend representation and abstraction. = Iranian Art = Parviz Tanavoli, The Last Poet of Iran, 1964 Artists include: Mahmud Ahmadi, Siah Armajani, Jamal Bakhshpour, Kamran Diba, Bijan Dowlatshahi, Ahmad Esfandiari, Mansour Ghandriz, Behrooz Golzari, Marcos Grigorian, Mahmoud Javadipour, Sirous Malek, Morteza Momayez, Mir-Hossein Mousavi Khameneh, Nassar Ovissi, Ru’in Pakbaz, Faramarz Pilaram, Behjat Sadr, Sohrab Sepehri, Masoumeh Seyhoun, Jazeh Tabatabai, Sadegh Tabrizi, Parviz Tanavoli, Esmail Tavakoli, Hamid Zarrine-Afsar, Charles-Hossein Zenderoudi. = Turkish Art = Artists include: Mustafa Aslier, Aliye Berger, Nurullah Berk, Sabri Berkel, Sadan Bezeyis, Abidin Elderoglu, Dervim Erbil, Bedri Rahmi Eyüboğlu, Ahmet Gürsoy, Nevil Islek, Özer Kabas, Füreya Koral, Princess Fahrelnissa Zeid. = Indian Art = Artists include: Prabhakar Barwe, Dhanraj Bhagat, Satish Gujral, Maqbool Fida Husain, Kanwal Krishna, Krishna Reddy, Francis Newton Souza, Vivan Sundaram, Jehangir P.

The New York University Art Collection  The New York University Art Collection, of which the Grey Art Gallery is now guardian, was founded in 1958 with NYU's acquisition of Francis Picabia’s Resonateur (c.1922) and Fritz Glarner’s Relational Painting (1949–50). Today the collection (which includes approximately 6,000 objects) is primarily composed of late-19th and 20th- century works, ranging from Pablo Picasso’s monumental public sculpture Bust of Sylvette to a Joseph Cornell box, Chocolat Menier, from 1952. The collection's particular strength is American painting from the 1940s to the present. European prints are also well represented, with works by Henri Matisse, Joan Mirò, and Picasso, to name a few. Artists in the NYU Art Collection include: Milton Avery, Ilya Bolotowsky, Sonia Delaunay, Arshile Gorky, Édouard Manet, Francis Picabia, and many others. The collection is especially rich in works by artists working in New York in the 1950s and '60s, such as Willem de Kooning, Helen Frankenthaler, Adolph Gottlieb, Al Held, Romare Bearden, Hans Hofmann, Alex Katz, Nicholas Krushenick, Yayoi Kusama, Agnes Martin, Robert Motherwell, Louise Nevelson, Kenneth Noland, Robert Rauschenberg, Ad Reinhardt, and Bernard (Tony) Rosenthal.

The large body of water at right is Mountain Meadows Reservoir, part of PG&E;'s separate Hamilton Branch Project. The Upper North Fork Feather River Project is a hydroelectric scheme in the Sierra Nevada of California, within Lassen and Plumas Counties. The project consists of three dams, five power plants, and multiple conduits and tunnels in the headwaters of the North Fork Feather River, a major tributary of the Feather—Sacramento River systems. The total installed capacity is 362.3 megawatts (MW), producing an annual average of 1,171.9 gigawatt hours (GWh). The project is also contracted for the delivery of irrigation water between March 31 and October 31 of each year. The project is owned and operated by Pacific Gas and Electric Company. The project is one of several on the North Fork and its tributaries, forming a hydroelectric system so extensive it has been dubbed the \\"Stairway of Power\\".  Background  The project was conceived in the early 1900s under the Great Western Power Company to provide hydroelectricity and water storage for irrigation in the Sacramento Valley. In 1908, the Big Bend or Las Plumas powerhouse was completed on the North Fork southeast of Paradise, generating 40 MW (later uprated to 70 MW) of hydroelectricity, which was sent as far away as Oakland, away. The power station replaced an earlier 1880 plant built by the Big Bend Tunnel and Mining Company for gold mining operations in the area which ultimately were unprofitable. In 1910, the Big Bend Dam, first permanent dam on the Feather River, was completed to increase the hydraulic head available to the powerhouse. During the early years of the project, few roads existed in this rugged section of the Sierra, so construction supplies were delivered via the Western Pacific Railroad, which was also under construction at the time. At its completion, the Big Bend power plant had the largest turbines, transformers and penstocks of any hydroelectric plant in the world. However, year-round generation at the plant was an impossibility due to seasonal fluctuations in the flow of the river. A large storage reservoir was first proposed to be built at Big Meadows, about upstream from Big Bend, by engineer Julius M. Howells. Great Western Power Company began to buy land in the valley for the future reservoir, but encountered bitter local opposition. The small town of Prattville in Big Meadows was burned to the ground July 4, 1909; arson was suspected, but has never been proven. Construction of the Canyon Dam to impound Lake Almanor at Big Meadows began in 1910. A rough one- way road was blazed from Greenville in the same year to transport workers and construction materials to the site, where a company town called Canyondam was established. Although originally conceived as a multiple-arch dam by its designers John S. Eastwood and H.H. Sinclair, concerns over the safety of this relatively new construction technique led to a change in the design. In March 1913, with over 40 percent of the dam completed, a state commission declared the structure unsafe. The partly completed dam was dynamited and a new earthfill structure, containing over of material, was built. The reservoir's name is a combination of the names of the daughters of Guy C. Earl, the vice president of Great Western. The construction of this reservoir, which at the time, had a capacity of , ensured a steady water supply for the powerhouse and for irrigation during the summer. A Great Western Power Company subsidiary, the Western Canal Company, would manage the distribution of water to farmers on the lower Feather River near Oroville in Butte County. Between 1919 and 1921, the first Caribou Powerhouse was built on the tributary Butt Creek, and a tunnel was excavated from Lake Almanor to the creek to provide water for the powerhouse. A high dam on Butt Creek was built in 1924 to increase the total water storage and power capacity. Between 1925–1927, the Canyon Dam was expanded, increasing Lake Almanor's capacity to . In 1930, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E;) acquired the Great Western Power Company and the Upper North Fork Project. However, the Western Canal Company (now known as the Western Canal Water District) continued to hold water rights to Lake Almanor and other PG&E; reservoirs along the Feather River, ensuring the continuation of irrigation deliveries. The third project dam, Belden Forebay, was built on the North Fork in 1958 to serve as an afterbay for the Caribou powerplant. The Caribou No. 2 powerplant was also built in 1958 to increase the total project generating capacity. In 1962, the Canyon Dam was raised again, enlarging the lake to its present capacity of . Six years later, in 1968, the giant Oroville Dam was completed on the Feather River as part of the California State Water Project, forming Lake Oroville, which flooded out most of the lower North Fork, including Big Bend Powerhouse and the Big Bend Dam. PG&E; completed the Belden Powerhouse in 1969 to replace the lost capacity. The last component of the project, Oak Flat Powerhouse, was built in 1985 to generate power from fishery releases, as federal law requires a minimum flow to be maintained in the otherwise dewatered river stretches between the dams.  Infrastructure = Canyon Dam, Lake Almanor, and Butt Valley Powerhouse  Located southeast of Chester, Lake Almanor, formed by the high, long earthfill Canyon Dam (also known as Almanor Dam), is the primary storage facility for the project, with a capacity of of water. At , Almanor is one of California's largest artificial lakes by surface area. The dam and reservoir control runoff from a watershed of , whose headwaters lie in Lassen Volcanic National Park to the northwest. Water from Lake Almanor is diverted southwest through the short Prattville Tunnel to Butt Valley Powerhouse, completed in 1958. The powerhouse is located on Butt Creek just above Butt Valley Reservoir. The 41 MW powerhouse has a gross hydraulic head of and a maximum flow capacity of . The powerhouse generates about 156.1 GWh per year.  Butt Valley Dam and the Caribou Powerhouses  The dam on Butt Creek, a tributary of the North Fork Feather River located south of Lake Almanor, was completed in 1924. The high, long dam forms a reservoir of which serves as an afterbay for the Butt Valley Powerhouse. Water from Butt Creek as well as North Fork water diverted through the Butt Valley Powerhouse is fed through tunnels from Butt Valley Reservoir to two powerhouses on the North Fork near Caribou. The 75 MW Caribou No. 1 powerhouse, completed in 1921, has an average head of and a flow capacity of , generating 171.4 GWh annually. The larger Caribou No. 2 powerhouse, completed in 1958, has a capacity of 120 MW, with the same hydraulic head as No. 1 but a larger flow capacity, . The plant generates 442.2 GWh per year. Because Caribou No. 2 has more efficient, newer turbines than No. 1, it is run throughout the year while No. 1 is now only operated in times of higher demand or when service is required at No. 2.  Belden Dam and Belden Powerhouse  Belden Dam (also known as Caribou Afterbay Dam) is a small earthfill diversion dam located on the North Fork Feather River, about downstream from Canyon Dam. Completed in 1958, the dam is high and long, with a storage capacity of . The dam and reservoir serve as an afterbay for the Caribou 1 and 2 powerhouses and operate as a run-of-the-river facility, meaning that inflows from the powerhouses and the North Fork must be passed downstream at approximately the same rate. Oak Flat Powerhouse is located at Belden Dam and generates power from water released into the North Fork for fish and wildlife conservation purposes, as the river would otherwise be dry because of the diversion to Belden Powerhouse. Completed in 1985, the 1.3 MW plant generates about 6.7 GWh per year from a maximum flow of . Most of the water, however, is diverted through a long tunnel to the Belden Powerhouse, which is located on Rock Creek Reservoir, another small reservoir on the North Fork. Rock Creek Reservoir is not part of the Upper North Fork project, but rather part of PG&E;'s separate Rock Creek-Cresta Hydroelectric Project. The 125 MW Belden Powerhouse, completed in 1969, has an average head of and a flow capacity of . The plant generates about 395.5 GWh per year.

History=Foundation Fr John Laurenson SJ first came to Clitheroe in 1794. There he started a mission to the local Catholics in the area. He resided in the nearby Stonyhurst College which was the great gift of Thomas Weld of his family seat to the recently returned English Jesuits from 200 years of European exile, and it was from there they did most of their work in the area. In 1798, Thomas Weld presented them with land on Lowergate so that they could build a church and a school.Clitheroe History retrieved 20 October 2013 In 1799, a small chapel was built on the site. A letter was found in the 21st century in which Thomas Weld requested that the parish priest at Clitheroe say Mass annually for the repose of his and his wife Mary's souls. Extensions By the nineteenth century, the Catholic population was increasing so the chapel had to be extended and a school was built attached to the chapel. In 1850, a larger church was built next door for the increasing congregation and the chapel was given entirely over to the school. Twenty years later, both the school and the church was again extended. In 1897, a new school was built on the same site, but next to the original one, so that the old chapel and school building were converted into a social centre for the parish. The original 1799 church building, now part of St Michael's Primary School, is a Grade II listed building. Parish St Mary's Church, Sabden In September 2008, the Jesuits handed the church over to the Diocese of Salford who continue to serve the parish.Jesuits pull out of historic Lancashire parish from Catholic Herald retrieved 5 February 2014 Two years later, the parish merged with St Mary Queen of Peace Church in Sabden to form the parish of Our Lady of the Valley. St Mary's was built in 1877 and it was made into a parish in 1909, so that the parishioners did not have to travel the sizeable distance to attend Mass in Clitheroe. The parish has two Sunday Masses at St Michael and St John Church, one on Saturday evening at 6:00pm and the other at 9:30am on Sunday morning.

The former settlement's location was west of Arcola along the BNSF Railway near Houston Southwest Airport. In 2014 the town site was no longer accessible by public roads. History The town of Duke grew up on the Sugar Land Railroad as a shipping point for sugar cane. Water from conveniently nearby Clear Lake was used to service the railroad locomotives. Postal service began in 1883 with John R. Fenn as postmaster. The bustling community consisted of a hotel, stock yard, store and sugar mills. The town was named after Duke Hessey, who operated the store.See historical marker photo. On October 19, 1888 there was a political rally at Duke that nearly resulted in violence between the contending factions. During the tense political struggle which later erupted in the Jaybird-Woodpecker War there was an attempt at civil debate. However, when Woodpecker candidate Kyle Terry took the stage at Duke, he had harsh words for his opponent Ned Gibson, a Jaybird. Though Gibson was not there, one of his brothers took vigorous offense. Terry brandished a pistol but was prevented from using it by an elderly African-American man, a former slave of the Terry family. The organizers of the event had taken the precaution of asking participants to leave their weapons at Fenn's store or in their buggies. So the flash point waited another ten months.

It is also spelled Lo according to the Cantonese pronunciation. Lu 路 is listed 138th in the Song Dynasty classic text Hundred Family Surnames. Lu 路 is the 116th most common surname in China, with a total population of 2.35 million. Demographics and distribution As of 2013, Lu 路 is the 116th most common surname in China, shared by 2.35 million people, or 0.18% of the Chinese population. It is distributed widely across China, but the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, and Henan have especially high concentrations of the surname; the four provinces account for 70% of the total population with the surname. Origins According to the ninth-century Tang Dynasty text Yuanhe Xing Zuan, the Lu 路 surname originated from the Red Di state of (潞氏 or 路氏), also called Lu, which was named after the river Lu (present-day Zhuozhang River, a tributary of the Zhang River). In 594 BC Lushi was conquered by Duke Jing, the ruler of the State of Jin, a major power of the Spring and Autumn period. The people of Lu/Lushi subsequently adopted Lu 路 as their surname. Another origin of Lu 路 is the Western Zhou Dynasty (1046–771 BC) government office of luzheng (路正), which was responsible for the management of roads and transportation (Lu 路 means road in Chinese). Some descendants of people who held the office adopted Lu as their surname. A third, legendary origin of Lu 路 is from Xuanyuan (玄元), a son of Emperor Zhi and grandson of Emperor Ku. He was enfeoffed as Marquis of Luzhong (路中侯) by Emperor Yao, and his descendants adopted Lu (from Luzhong) as their surname. Later adoption During the Xianbei Northern Wei dynasty, Emperor Xiaowen (reigned 467–499 AD) implemented a drastic policy of sinicization, ordering his own people to adopt Chinese surnames. The Moluzhen (没路真) tribe of Xianbei adopted Lu 路 as their surname. Some of the Dong people, an ethnic minority group of China, have also adopted Lu 路 as their surname.

He said throughout his career that he was deaf which led to foreign media dubbing him a \\"digital-age Beethoven\\". He was also the name credited for the video games Resident Evil: Dual Shock Ver. (1998) and Onimusha: Warlords (2001). In February 2014, it was revealed that most of the work attributed to him over the previous 18 years had been written by Takashi Niigaki. Biography Samuragochi was born on 21 September 1963 in Hiroshima Prefecture to parents who were both hibakusha (irradiated in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima). He started playing the piano at the age of four. He started suffering migraines while in high school, and said that, by the time he was 35, he had completely lost his hearing. After graduating from high school, Samuragochi did not attend university or music school, due to his dislike of modern composition methods, and he instead taught himself how to compose. On 31 March 2013, Samuragochi was the subject of a 50-minute Japanese TV documentary titled and broadcast by NHK. The documentary followed him as he met survivors of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in northern Japan. Doubts about musical abilities and deafness statements In June 2013, a reporter from the magazine Aera interviewed Samuragochi at his apartment in Yokohama, but noticed a number of inconsistencies in Samuragochi's deafness statements, including his ability to respond to questions before the sign- language interpreter had finished, and standing up to answer a doorbell when it rang. The interview was ultimately not published by the magazine due to doubts about Samuragochi's statements. When Samuragochi's first symphony was performed on tour by a full orchestra, the composer Takeo Noguchi noticed that it was an adaptation of little-known works from earlier composers like Gustav Mahler, and doubted Samuragochi's story, which was sourced entirely to his record label. Noguchi's article was turned down by musical publications, as Samuragochi's record label was one of their advertising sponsors, and instead was published in the November 2013 issue of the newsweekly Shincho 45, as . After the ghostwriting was revealed, Noguchi's article was awarded the Editors' Choice Magazine Journalism Award. Ghostwriting admission On 5 February 2014, it was publicly revealed that music attributed to Samuragochi since 1996 had actually been ghostwritten by Takashi Niigaki, a musician, composer, and part-time lecturer at the Toho Gakuen School of Music in Tokyo. Niigaki also said Samuragochi was not deaf and states that Samuragochi has normal hearing and was posing as a deaf man to generate a mystique around his image as a composer. Niigaki also said that Samuragochi did not need to use his cane, and that most of his biography printed in album liner notes was fiction. Niigaki went to the press because one of Samuragochi's \\"compositions\\" would be used by Japanese figure skater Daisuke Takahashi, at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. On 12 February 2014, Samuragochi released a handwritten statement in which he revealed that he had a Grade 2 physical disability certificate after losing his hearing and to have partially regained his hearing three years previously. He also added that he was \\"deeply ashamed of living a lie.\\" Following the revelation, the city of Hiroshima announced that it would be revoking the Hiroshima Citizens' Award it presented to Samuragochi in 2008. On 7 March 2014, he gave a press conference in Tokyo, appearing in public for the first time since the ghostwriting allegations arose. He admitted that while his hearing was impaired, it did not meet the legal requirements for deafness, and that he had returned his disability certificate.

The road is built along steep cliffs on the east side of the Urnersee (first part of the Lake Lucerne) weaving through many rock fall galleries and tunnels along its route. Upon completion in 1865, the Axenstrasse was the first way to get to Uri that did not involve navigating Lake Lucerne. History The Axenstrasse in 1904 The engineer, Landamman (cantonal council's president) of Uri, and Federal Councillor of State Karl Emanuel Müller (1804–1869) initiated the first road for horse-drawn carriages. Construction on a new road to connect Flüelen to Brunnen began in 1861, and was completed in 1865. The name of the Axenstrasse refers to one particular part of the mountains the Axenstrasse circumvents and traverses, the high, vertical rock between Flüelen and Sisikon, actually a farmed meadow terrace (Ober Axen and Unter Axen) right below the much higher Rophaien (). The route, especially in the part south of Sisikon, involves many open passages with rock galleries and numerous openings in the west tunnel walls viewing Urnersee as a result of the tunnel blasting through the calcareous rock. The road costs were 842,000 francs in 1865, half of which was paid for by the federal government of Switzerland. The Axenstrasse in 2009 The Axenstrasse cuts through the village of Sisikon Between 1937 and 1939, the Axenstrasse was altered to suit modern traffic in lieu of horse-drawn carriages, and a lane in each direction for road traffic was paved. Many sections of the old Axenstrasse were also closed to automotive traffic to serve as hiking trails. The Axenstrasse was again renovated between 1975 and 1990. Route The Axenstrasse is a middle section between the A4 motorway and the A2 motorway, and a part of the European route E41 in a north-south direction, but still on a two-lane road with oncoming traffic. Between Brunnen and Flüelen, there are no major junctions, although about halfway through, just south of the border between the cantons of Uri and Schwyz, there is one small settlement, Sisikon. At the southern end of the route, there is a connection to the Klausen Pass road in Altdorf and a connection to the A2 motorway and European route E35 near the Seelisberg Tunnel on the other side of the Urnersee. For all of its length, the Axenstrasse parallels the Gotthard railway, a part of the Swiss Federal Railways.

It is easily seen that its value at q = 1 is the usual binomial coefficient \\\\binom{n}{k}, so it is a generating function for the subsets of {1, 2, ..., n} of size k. These subsets carry a natural action of the cyclic group C of order n which acts by adding 1 to each element of the set, modulo n. For example, when n = 4 and k = 2, the group orbits are : {1, 3} \\\\to {2, 4} \\\\to {1, 3} (of size 2) and : {1, 2} \\\\to {2, 3} \\\\to {3, 4} \\\\to {1, 4} \\\\to {1, 2} (of size 4). One can showV. Reiner, D. Stanton and D. White, The cyclic sieving phenomenon, Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A, Volume 108 Issue 1, October 2004, Pages 17–50 that evaluating the q-binomial coefficient when q is an nth root of unity gives the number of subsets fixed by the corresponding group element. In the example n = 4 and k = 2, the q-binomial coefficient is : \\\\left[{4 \\\\atop 2}\\\\right]_q = 1 + q + 2q^2 + q^3 + q^4; evaluating this polynomial at q = 1 gives 6 (as all six subsets are fixed by the identity element of the group); evaluating it at q = −1 gives 2 (the subsets {1, 3} and {2, 4} are fixed by two applications of the group generator); and evaluating it at q = ±i gives 0 (no subsets are fixed by one or three applications of the group generator). List of cyclic sieving phenomena In the Reiner–Stanton–White paper, the following example is given: Let α be a composition of n, and let W(α) be the set of all words of length n with αi letters equal to i. A descent of a word w is any index j such that w_j>w_{j+1}. Define the major index \\\\operatorname{maj}(w) on words as the sum of all descents. \\\\---- The triple (X_n,C_{n-1},\\\\frac{1}{[n+1]_q}\\\\left[{2n \\\\atop n}\\\\right]_q) exhibit a cyclic sieving phenomenon, where X_n is the set of non-crossing (1,2)-configurations of [n − 1]. \\\\---- Let λ be a rectangular partition of size n, and let X be the set of standard Young tableaux of shape λ. Let C = Z/nZ act on X via promotion. Then (X,C,\\\\frac{[n]!_q}{\\\\prod_{(i,j)\\\\in \\\\lambda} [h_{ij}]_q}) exhibit the cyclic sieving phenomenon. Note that the polynomial is a q-analogue of the hook length formula. Furthermore, let λ be a rectangular partition of size n, and let X be the set of semi-standard Young tableaux of shape λ. Let C = Z/kZ act on X via k-promotion. Then (X,C, q^{-\\\\kappa(\\\\lambda)}s_\\\\lambda(1,q,q^2,\\\\dotsc,q^{k-1} )) exhibit the cyclic sieving phenomenon. Here, \\\\kappa(\\\\lambda)=\\\\sum_i (i-1)\\\\lambda_i and sλ is the Schur polynomial. \\\\---- An increasing tableau is a semi-standard Young tableau, where both rows and columns are strictly increasing, and the set of entries is of the form 1,2,\\\\dotsc,\\\\ell for some \\\\ell. Let Inc_k(2\\\\times n) denote the set of increasing tableau with two rows of length n, and maximal entry 2n-k. Then (\\\\operatorname{Inc}_k(2\\\\times n),C_{2n-k}, q^{n+\\\\binom{k}{2}} \\\\frac{\\\\left[{n-1 \\\\atop k}\\\\right]_q \\\\left[{2n-k \\\\atop n-k-1}\\\\right]_q}{ [n-k]_q }) exhibit the cyclic sieving phenomenon, where C_{2n-k} act via K-promotion. \\\\---- Let S_{\\\\lambda,j} be the set of permutations of cycle type λ and exactly j excedances. Let a_{\\\\lambda,j}(q) = \\\\sum_{\\\\sigma \\\\in S_{\\\\lambda,j} }q^{\\\\operatorname{maj}(\\\\sigma)-\\\\operatorname{exc}(\\\\sigma)}, and let C_n act on S_{\\\\lambda,j} by conjugation. Then (S_{\\\\lambda,j}, C_n, a_{\\\\lambda,j}(q)) exhibit the cyclic sieving phenomenon.  Notes and references  * Sagan, Bruce. The cyclic sieving phenomenon: a survey.

It originally aired on February 11, 2010. The episode was written by Brett Conrad and directed by Marcos Siega. Plot Elena (Nina Dobrev) wakes up and finds herself in a strange hotel room. She sees Ben (Sean Faris) sleeping and tries to slowly sneak out but Ben wakes up. Anna (Malese Jow) arrives and drags Elena to the bathroom locking her in. Elena finds Bonnie (Kat Graham) lying unconscious in the bathtub. She tries to help Bonnie and Elena informs her that Ben is with Anna and they want to open the tomb but they need a witch to do that. Meanwhile, Stefan (Paul Wesley) looks everywhere for Elena all over Mystic Falls but he cannot find her. He goes to Damon (Ian Somerhalder) asking for his help but Damon, who is still mad at him, does not want to help. Damon leaves Stefan alone and goes to Bonnie's grandmother, Sheila (Jasmine Guy), asking for Bonnie but Sheila knows really well who he is and tells him to go away. Back at the motel room, Anna explains to Elena that she wants to get into the tomb to free her mother Pearl (Kelly Hu) who's trapped in there. Anna calls Stefan and asks him to bring her the Grimoire otherwise she will kill Elena. Stefan does not have it but promises he can get it and they arrange to meet Damon at a public place. While Anna goes to meet Damon, she runs into Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) who invites her to a party. Anna tries to avoid him at the beginning but she changes her mind when she hears where the party will be — near the old cemetery. She takes off to meet Damon. Damon insists that he works alone but when Anna threatens to kill Elena, the two of them come to an agreement. In the meantime, Stefan appears at the motel room and helps Elena and Bonnie. As they run out of the room, Stefan warns Ben to leave town otherwise, if he sees him again he will kill him. Anna comes back and finds Ben hiding behind the bed to avoid the sunlight. Ben tells her that Stefan came and he couldn't do anything. Anna realizes that she lost the witch but she knows that Damon will open the tomb no matter what and she has to be there when that happens. Bonnie, Elena and Stefan are at Sheila's house talking and Elena thinks they do not have choice but to help Damon get Katherine back. Sheila agrees to open the tomb as long as the rest of the vampires are burned. Elena has to earn Damon's trust back and leaves to go and find him and talk to him. She finds him at the Salvatore house and she convinces him to trust her again. Stefan, Bonnie and Sheila wait for Damon and Elena at the church ruins. Stefan brought along arsonist tools. Damon, who brought an IV bag of blood for Katherine, and Elena arrive and Sheila and Bonnie start the process to break the spell and open the tomb. Stefan runs outside to get his arsonist tools. Meanwhile, Jeremy gets to the party and looks around for Anna. Anna shows up and the two of them go for a walk away from the crowd. Anna tells him that she is leaving town with her mom and Jeremy kisses her. Anna's face begins to show that she is a vampire and Jeremy asks her what is going on when Ben appears and knocks him out. Anna tells Ben to drag Jeremy close to the tomb so they can use him for Pearl to feed on when they get her out. Stefan runs into Ben while he is getting his tools. Anna also appears and tells him that she will take her mother out and gives Stefan a choice. He can try to stop her or save Jeremy from Ben. Stefan leaves Anna and goes and stays alone with Ben who tries to attack him believing he is stronger. Stefan uses the arsonist tool and burns him. Meanwhile, Bonnie and Sheila keep chanting the spell and the tomb's door cracks open. Damon, to be sure that Sheila won't seal him into the tomb, grabs Elena and takes her with him. Inside the tomb, Elena hears whispering and asks what is happening. Damon informs her that they can sense her but he runs off to find Katherine leaving Elena alone. Elena searches for him while she stumbles over the desiccated bodies of the vampires and freaks out. Anna arrives at the tomb finding the door open. Bonnie wants to stop her but Sheila does not let her, so Anna goes into the tomb. Bonnie wants to know why her Grams let her in and Sheila says that no vampire will come out of the tomb. They managed to open the door but not break the seal spell so a vampire can go in but not come out. Stefan comes back and wants to run into the tomb when he hears Damon took Elena with him but Sheila stops him, explaining to him why. Inside the tomb, Anna finds Elena and explains to her how Stefan and Jonathan Gilbert are responsible for her mother's imprisonment and why she decided that it would be Gilbert family's blood that will bring her mother back to life. She bites Elena who starts screaming making Stefan run into the tomb to find her. Anna feeds Elena's blood to Pearl but Stefan gets there in time before Pearl kills her. Elena runs away to get out of the tomb. Bonnie wants to help Stefan get out and she begs Sheila to lift the seal just for a while so Stefan can escape. Elena escapes and Bonnie tells her about the seal. Stefan gets to the door but cannot step outside and Elena realizes that he went in only to save her even though he knew. She also remembers the promise they gave Damon and Stefan goes back inside to find his brother. Bonnie and Sheila cast a spell to lift the seal and Anna comes out with her mother. Damon is still in the tomb but he cannot find Katherine anywhere. Stefan comes to him and realizes that Katherine is not in the tomb, never was. Damon is frustrated and throws the IV bag of blood against the wall breaking it. Stefan urges him to hurry so they can get out before the seal closes again. Elena runs in to beg them to leave. The three of them get out just in time before the door closes again. Bonnie and Sheila go back home while Sheila looks exhausted over the energy she spent for the spell and goes to lie down. Elena and Stefan rush to find Jeremy who is waking up and he is fine. Damon is shocked for not finding Katherine and Elena hugs him telling him she is sorry. Elena takes Jeremy home who says he cannot remember anything but when Elena leaves to go to Bonnie, Jeremy starts searching on the Internet about vampires. Anna brings her mother to the motel room where they find Damon waiting for them. Damon grabs Pearl threatening to kill her and accuses Anna of knowing the whole time that Katherine was not in the tomb. Anna admits that she did know but she did not tell him because then he would never have helped her open the tomb. Pearl explains to him how Katherine got away and Anna tells him that she saw Katherine a few years ago. Katherine knew where Damon was but she did not care to find him. Damon is heart broken over the information and leaves. Bonnie goes to check on her Grams but she finds her dead. She starts yelling for help while she desperately goes through the spell book to find a spell that will bring her back and Elena calls 911. Back at the tomb, a vampire manages to get to the blood bag Damon threw against the wall and he feeds on its contents. He gets up, slowly gets to the door sliding it open and exits the tomb revealing that the seal spell did not work.

Reviews \\"Fool me Once\\" received positive reviews. Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.3/5. \\"But it seems as though producers were aware of this potential for a plot device, which is why \\"Fool Me Once\\" was yet another example of why The Vampire Diaries is an exciting, well-paced show that delivers answers and surprises every week.\\" Richenthal also praised the writers of how they portray Damon and Somerhalder for his ability to play him: \\"Ian Somerhalder has had a blast playing this manipulative, fun-loving character. But he's clearly capable of a layered depth, as well. While so many other shows struggle with how to turn an evil character into a sympathetic figure, The Vampire Diaries has slowly given us more and more on Damon, making him into a tragic villain. Could you really blame Elena for giving him a hug at the end?\\" Josie Kafka from Doux Reviews rated the episode with 4/4. \\"There were two great tragedies this week: Grams’s death and Katherine’s absence. Now that Grams is dead, our heroes are lacking a guiding moral compass who knows the dark side and how to avoid going over to it; Katherine’s absence…well, we’ll see how that plays out.\\" Robin Franson Pruter from Forced Viewing rated the episode with 4/4. \\"Excellent episode features complex plot and emotionally powerful events. [...] This episode had the potential to be a huge failure. [...] The expectations for the return of Katherine, the vampire who turned the Salvatore brothers into vampires and turned them against each other, were high. So, in the face of all that build- up, the opening of the tomb to reveal that Katherine was never in there in the first place could have been a debacle on the level of Geraldo Rivera and Al Capone’s safe. But it wasn’t. The show managed to create the sense that the shock of her not being there outweighed the disappointment of that fact.\\" Franson Pruter also praised Somerhalder for the way he portrayed a heart- wrenching Damon. Popsugar of Buzzsugar gave a good review to the episode saying that she is pretty satisfied and commenting that Elena and Damon had some amazing scenes together. \\"The show is as intense as we've come to expect from the freshman series, and I think it's a fitting way to end things for a bit.\\" Kath Skerry of Give Me My Remote gave a good review to the episode saying: \\"If we’re going to have to wait over a month until we head back to Mystic Falls, at least we were left with one hell of an episode. Although I missed some of Damon’s trademark sass, \\"Fool Me Once\\" had me completely captivated (and a bit spooked). Talk about gut wrenching.\\" Meg from Two Cents TV also gave a good review to the episode. \\"What a night it was! For the last new episode before its month-long hiatus, The Vampire Diaries certainly delivered a plot-packed hour with lots of twisty goodness.\\" Lucia from Heroine TV stated that \\"it was another stellar hour of television that left me wanting for more.\\" Notes *This is the first episode that Matt Davis, who portrays Alaric Saltzman, credited as part of the main cast and not as a guest. Despite that, he didn't appear on the episode.

This case is often also cited regarding the award for exemplary damages. Background Tak was in the business of importing pedigree cattle into Japan and contracted AEL to certify that these cattle were indeed pedigree cattle. At the start, both parties signed a pro forma invoice with terms and conditions. A pro forma invoice is a document that states a commitment from the seller to sell goods to the buyer at specified prices and terms. Unfortunately, it was later discovered that AEL had falsified its records for the livestock it exported, so extensively that it was found that out of 185 heifers on the first shipment, AEL had falsely certified 111 commercial cattle as pedigree. The second shipment had similar falsified certificates. Tak not happy with this, sued AEL for damages for breach of contract under the terms and conditions contained in the pro forma invoice, as well as for exemplary damages as well. AEL defended this by claiming the pro forma invoice conditions were not part of the contract, but instead were merely \\"understandings\\" that were not confirmed in the subsequent invoices. Held The court ruled the terms and conditions in the pro forma invoice were part of the contract. Hammond J went on to state: Furthermore, besides awarding general damages, the court also awarded the modest amount of $25,000 in exemplary damages for \\"knowingly deceitful conduct\\".

He was associated with the Ethnological Museum of Berlin (; until 1999 Museum für Völkerkunde) His field work was directed to researching and recording the use of artefacts in their indigenous context, to begin to understand these societies. His work in cultural and social anthropology extended to researching and recording the music and dance of the Pacific Islands. He collaborated with Dieter Christensen, a music- ethnologist, on The Music of the Ellice Islands (German: Die Musik der Ellice- Inseln) (1964) and Koch also published the Songs of Tuvalu (translated by Guy Slatter) (2000). In Tuvalu he was also known as 'Keti'.  Biography  As a child Gerd Koch was fascinated by accounts of explorers including the Pacific voyages of James Cook. After he completed his secondary school leaving examination his family could not afford to send him to university so he became an apprentice salesman at the Pelikan fountain pen company in Hanover. He joined the German Navy in 1941 and was trained as a radio operator. His military service involved monitoring radio communications in the English Channel. He was accepted at Göttingen University in the winter term of 1945 where he studied ethnology. He was interested in the subject of acculturation, the process of cultural change that results following meeting between cultures. In 1949 he wrote a dissertation that was titled Die frühen europäischen Einflüsse auf die Kultur der Bewohner der Tonga-Inseln 1616-1852 (The early European influences on the culture of the inhabitants of the Tonga Islands 1616-1852). After he received his PhD, he worked at sorting and cataloguing exhibits of the Ethnological Museum of Berlin (Museum für Völkerkunde), which were in storage at Celle. In 1951 Koch carried out field studies in Tonga and also visited Samoa, Fiji and New Caledonia. On his return he found temporary work cataloguing the ethnological collection of the state museum in Hanover. In 1957 he was offered a position as the custodian of the Pacific (Südsee) Department at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. He also lectured at the Free University of Berlin (Freie Universität Berlin). In 1960 and 1961 he undertook field studies in the Ellice Islands (now known as Tuvalu). He returned to the Ellice Islands in 1964 then he carried out research in the Gilbert Islands (now known as Kiribati). At this time these islands were administered by the British as the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony. In 1966 he undertook field studies in the Pacific, visiting the Gazelle Peninsula in New Britain, Papua New Guinea; followed by the Santa Cruz Islands and the Reef Islands in the Solomon Islands. In the 1970s he carried out field work in the Papua Province of New Guinea belonging to Indonesia, near the border with Papua New Guinea.  Field studies = Tonga, Fiji and Samoa in 1951–1952  In 1951 he obtained the support of the Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft (Emergency Association of German Science) to carry out field work on cultural change in the Kingdom of Tonga from October 1951 to June 1952. He received assisted from the Crown Prince (later King Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV) who arranged for Koch to stay with relatives on Nomuka in the Ha'apai group of islands. Koch developed techniques in the recording of culture, including the use of tape-recorders and cinematographic cameras. Koch completed five short films about Tonga culture. During this expedition Koch also carried out research and made further documentary films in Fiji (in the Sigatoka region) and in Samoa (in Falealupo on the western tip of Savai'i). The films that Koch completed were made available for public exhibition in 1954 by the Encyclopaedia Cinematographica in Göttingen, with the films now held by the German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB) in Hanover.  Ellice islands in 1960–1961  Koch visited the atolls of Nanumaga, Nukufetau and Niutao, which resulted in his publication of a book on the material culture of the Ellice Islands. Following the change of name to Tuvalu, the English translation by Guy Slatter was published under the title The Material Culture of Tuvalu. In the early 1960s the elders of the islands retained memories of the late 19th century before the influence of the Christian missionaries (who were predominantly Samoan missionaries that were trained by the London Missionary Society) and the European traders and colonial administrators had impacted on the cultures of the islands. This allowed Koch to record the traditional music of Tuvalu and film traditional Tuvaluan dancing such as the fakanau, fakaseasea and fatele. Koch filmed men of Niutao engaged in mock battles in which traditional styles of combat and self-defence called failima were displayed. These fighting techniques, using traditional spears and clubs, had been developed when the islands were subject to raids by warriors from Tonga and the Gilbert Islands (Kiribati). Gerd Koch also made recordings of traditional songs on the islands of Niutao, Nanumaga and Nukufetau. These songs were considered in a 1964 musicological publication, with a selection of the songs published in 2000 as Songs of Tuvalu together with two CDs of the recorded songs.  Gilbert and Ellice islands in 1963  Tepukei (ocean-going outrigger canoe) from the Santa Cruz Islands He returned to the Ellice Islands, where he showed the films he made on his previous visit and made further film documentaries. Koch then carried out research continued on the Gilbert Islands, and in 1965 he published a book on the material culture of the Gilbert Islands. Following the change of name to Kiribati, the English translation by Guy Slatter was published under the title The Material Culture of Kiribati.  New Britain, Papua New Guinea and the Santa Cruz Islands in 1966–67  From November 1966 to the end of February 1967 he undertook field studies in the Pacific, spending several weeks on Gazelle Peninsula in New Britain and in the Maprik District of East Sepik Province in Papua New Guinea (PNG). He then spent four months in the Solomon Islands, carrying out research at Graciosa Bay on Nendö Island (Ndende/Ndeni) in the Santa Cruz Islands and on Pileni and Fenualoa in the Reef Islands and returned with documentary film, photographic and audio material. In 1971 Koch published Die Materielle Kultur der Santa Cruz-Inseln. Koch did not collect artefacts that were of importance to the inhabitants. Significant artefacts that he brought back to the Ethnological Museum of Berlin were the gable roof of a large meeting house from the East Sepik Province and the last still complete Tepukei (ocean-going outrigger canoe) from the Santa Cruz Islands.  Irian Jaya (Papua Province of Indonesia) 1970s  In the 1970s Gerd Koch and Klaus Helfrich, who subsequently became the Director of the Berlin Museum, attempted to get funding from the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)) for an inter- discipline project to carry out field work in the Papua Province of New Guinea belonging to Indonesia, near the border with Papua New Guinea, which Europeans has not visited, and which in the 1970s had become a focus for Christian evangelists. While the intended inter-discipline project did not proceed the project resulted in a major exhibition at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin entitled \\"Steinzeit Heute\\" (Stone Age Today), which opened in 1979.  Career  For more than two decades he was the Deputy Director of the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. He was also the co-publisher of the Baessler-Archiv Beitrage zur Volkerkunde Neue Folge, which published articles on social anthropology. In 1984 he was awarded an honorary professorship from the Free University of Berlin. His final exhibition was 'Boote aus aller Welt' (Boats from all over the World). He retired from the Museum in 1985, although he continued to lecture at the university until 1990.  Death and legacy  Koch returned to Tuvalu and Tonga in 1996, where he met islanders who were children when he visited in the 1960s. Following his retirement he continued to write and publish on ethnological topics. Gerd Koch brought his life to a self- determined end on 19 April 2005 off the coast of Newfoundland when travelling by boat to New York. His field work produced 121 documentary films, with the films now held by the TIB in Hanover. His film work includes 15 short documentary films about aspects of Tuvaluan culture and a further 70 films were made by Koch in the Gilbert Islands (Kiribati). The Ethnological Museum of Berlin also holds approximately 12,000 photos and an extensive collection of audio tapes (including music-ethnological material) recorded by Koch. He planned the permanent Pacific Exhibition at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin that opened in 1970 and which continued in the form he designed for over 30 years. The Pacific Exhibition occupied 3,000 sq. meters, with the 17 m. high ceilings allowing the exhibition of boats and architectural elements in their original size, including the only surviving original Tepukei (ocean-going canoe) that Dr. Koch obtained in the Santa Cruz Islands in 1966–67.  Publications  His published work includes: * Suedsee-Gestern und Heute: Der Kulturwandel bei den Tonganern und der Versuch einer Deutung dieser Entwicklung (Pacific – yesterday and to-day: acculturation with the Tongans and an attempt at an interpretation of this development) was published in 1955 as Volume 7 of Research into the history of culture, edited by Dr Nabil Georg Eckart, Professor of Kant University, Brunswick, and Dr Herman Trimborn, Professor of Bonn University.

Early life Nazikeda Kadın was born in 1848 in Abkhazia. She was a member of Abkhazian princely family, Tsanba. Her father was Prince Arzakan Bey Tsanba, and her mother was Princess Esma Hanım Klıç, also an Abkhazian. She had been brought to Istanbul as a young child, where her father entrusted her to the household of the wife of grand vizier Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha, where her name according to Ottoman custom was changed to Nazikeda. Here she learned the court protocol, and to play the piano. In 1858, aged ten, when Cemile Sultan, the daughter of Sultan Abdulmejid I, married Mahmud Celaleddin Pasha, the son of Fethi Ahmed Pasha, the groom's mother took Nazikeda, and presented her to Cemile. Pleased by the well-bred manners of Nazikeda, Cemile made her a personal attendant who always accompanied her mistress. Marriage One day, when Abdul Hamid was in his twenties, he visited his younger sister Cemile Sultan at her palace at Kandilli. Here he saw Nazikeda, and fell in love with her. He asked his sister to give him Nazikeda in marriage. In fact, Cemile also noticed that this young girl had pleased her brother, and she immediately presented her to him. The marriage took place in 1867 in the Dolmabahçe Palace. In 1868, a year after the marriage, she gave birth to her only daughter, Ulviye Sultan. On 5 October 1875, when Ulviye was seven, she was burned to death playing with matches, while Nazikeda, who tried to save her, also suffered severe burns. In his reflections, Abdul Hamid referred three times to the death of his first child. He considered it the first traumatic experience of his life curiously not mentioning the death of his mother when he was eleven or the death of his father when he was fourteen. After Abdul Hamid's accession to the throne on 31 August 1876, she was installed the principal consort with the title of \\"Senior Consort\\". According to Leyla Saz, she was in every way worthy of this position both with respect to her lofty spirit and because of her beauty. In 1877, Nazikeda and other members of the imperial family settled in the Yıldız Palace, after Abdul Hamid moved there on 7 April 1877. She held the second highest position in the imperial harem after Perestu Kadın. Nazikeda, however, never forgot her first mistress, the wife of Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha. Deeply grateful to her for the training she received, Nazikeda obtained Abdul Hamid's permission to invite her to the palace. When according to the protocol the old lady bowed before her, Nazikeda persuaded her to sit beside her. After the death of Peyveste Hanım's father, Nazikeda's paternal cousin Meryem Hanım presented her widowed mother Hesna Hanım and her sisters to Nazikeda. She won over Hesna, and adopted her daughters. Peyveste went onto marry Abdul Hamid in 1893, and became mother of the couple's only child, a son, Şehzade Abdurrahim Hayri, born in 1894. Death Nazikeda Kadın died on 7 February 1895 in the Yıldız Palace, and was buried in the mausoleum of imperial ladies in Yeni Mosque in Istanbul.

Iteris Inc. was established in 2004. The company from which it was formed, Odetics Inc., was originally founded in 1969, in Anaheim, California and incorporated in Delaware in 1987. Joe Bergera has served as the company's president and chief executive officer since 2015, and Iteris reported revenue of $114.1 million in fiscal year 2020, ending March 31. History The company from which Iteris Inc. was formed, Odetics Inc., was originally founded in 1969, in Anaheim, California,Orange County Register: * * and incorporated in Delaware in 1987. It served as a business incubator for technology companies, and provided digital tape recorders to aerospace manufacturers. Odetics received an initial public offering in 1989. The company became known as simply Iteris in October 2004, through reverse merger. The company acquired Meridian Environmental Technology Inc. (MET), which developed technologies related to traveler information and meteorology, during 2010–2011. Meridian continued to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary. In 2011, Iteris acquired Berkeley Transportation Systems (BTS), a Northern California-based privately held company that analyzes transport networks and their effectiveness. In July 2019, Iteris acquired Albeck Gerken, Inc., a privately held traffic operations engineering services provider headquartered in Tampa, Florida. Iteris was reportedly earning $68 million in annual revenue in 2015, and was added to the Russell 2000 Index on June 26, 2017. In May 2020, the company sold its agriculture and weather analytics business segment to DTN, an operating company of TBG AG. In mid 2020, Iteris reported revenue of $114.1 million for the previous fiscal year, ending March 31. Leadership Joe Bergera has served as the company's president and chief executive officer (CEO) since 2015. Former CEOs include Jack Johnson, who served until 2007, and Abbas Mohaddes, who served from 2007–2015. Kevin Daly served as interim CEO between Mohaddes and Bergera, and maintained his longtime board position following the latter's hiring. Products and services Iteris provides software and consulting services for smart mobility infrastructure management, including software as a service, managed services, and advisory services, and produces sensors and other devices that record and predict traffic conditions, in conjunction with proprietary data analysis software. Road and traffic data collected and analyzed by the company help clients enhance transportation services. Traffic and transportation According to Business Insider, Iteris is the \\"leading provider of outdoor vision systems and sensors that optimize the flow of traffic and enhance driver safety\\". The company uses digital image processing, information technology, and traffic engineering to provide safety and transportation solutions. In 2000, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) implemented an advanced traveller information system developed as part of a public–private partnership between the agency and Iteris. The system was among the first in the United States to collect data by reading motorists' wireless signals. Iteris designed a crash avoidance system in 2000 to warn Mercedes- Benz Actros drivers if trucks drifted outside their lane without using a turn signal. The lane departure warning system was available on approximately 8,000 trucks in Europe and the United States by 2004, and offered on two cars, the 2005 Infiniti FX crossover and the 2006 Infiniti M. In 2004, Iteris and Valeo were reportedly collaborating on a camera-based vision system for heavy duty trucks using active pixel sensors and integrated signal processing. In 2009, the Southern California Association of Governments hired Iteris to survey trucking companies about possible Interstate 710 usage; the company's senior vice president was selected by Bill Bogaard to serve on a working group in 2014 to study the freeway's expansion. Iteris and Traffic Products worked to replace video surveillance systems on traffic lights in Murrysville, Pennsylvania, along U.S. Route 22, in 2010. VDOT hired Iteris again in 2011 to improve the state's 5-1-1 system over five years. The company began developing engineering and planning guidelines for the Abu Dhabi Department of Transport in 2011. Iteris partnered with TrafQuest again, having previously collaborated on an intelligent transportation system action plan for the department. In late 2013, the National Highway Institute chose Iteris to create and maintain a five-year training program for use by local, state, and federal highway and transportation agencies. The nearly $18 million contract was funded by the Federal Highway Administration, a division of the USDOT. The city of San Diego purchased Iteris equipment in 2014 as part of a pilot program to count bicyclists and influence signal lengths displayed by traffic lights. The cameras were not installed along Harbor Drive until 2016, and engineers had to assess the system's accuracy and address inconsistencies by comparing automatically generated counts with actual video footage. In Texas, the company's vehicle detection system has directed the merging of traffic. Iteris analyzed technical data for the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority in 2015 to determine if removing two bus lanes would impact traffic on El Camino Real between Palo Alto and San Jose. The company was developing vehicle-to- traffic-infrastructure technology, as of mid 2015, to facilitate communication between vehicles and traffic signals. The Oregon Department of Transportation used Iteris Freeway Performance Measurement software in Central Oregon to use mobile phone data to monitor and predict traffic problems associated with the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017. In May, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development signed a $2 million contract with Arcadis, Iteris, and Alliance Transportation Group to help prepare the state for vehicular automation. Iteris evaluated the necessity to keep nearly a dozen traffic signals in Columbus, Nebraska, in 2017. The cities of Bentonville, Arkansas, and Gainesville, Florida, have used Iteris' VantageLive! traffic data collection software to capture traffic, pedestrian and bicycle counts at major intersections. The South Carolina Department of Transportation uses the company's ClearGuide mobility intelligence software as a service to reduce traffic congestion and delays, and to manage evacuation traffic during and after severe weather. Agriculture and weather Prior to its sale of its agriculture and weather analytics business segment to DTN in May 2020, Iteris offered products specifically for agriculture, including the ClearAg system, which used weather simulation to recommend harvest times based on predicted atmosphere and soil conditions, as well as crop moisture amounts. The platform also helped growers determine the best times to plant, fertilize, and treat crops, delivering advice via application programming interfaces (APIs) and apps. In April 2015, the company received a patent for the system, which was used to track storms as a form of crop protection for BASF. As of 2016, Iteris was the only company using land surface models for climate and weather prediction as a tool for farmers to use to improve agriculture practices. Recognition In 2014, Iteris earned a transportation planning award from the American Planning Association for offering recommendations and \\"appropriate technology for efficient mobility\\" to the Long Beach general plan. The company and Delcan Technologies were recognized for their contributions to MDOT's Automated Vehicle Location and Maintenance Decision Support System Program, which earned a \\"Best of ITS\\" award in the \\"Best New Innovative Practice in the Sustainability in Transportation\\" category from ITS America.

Cal. 2013) was a Northern District of California Court case in which the court held that sending a cease-and-desist letter and enacting an IP address block is sufficient notice of online trespassing, which a plaintiff can use to claim a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. 3Taps and PadMapper were companies that partnered to provide an alternative user interface for browsing Craigslist's housing ads. In doing so, they scraped Craigslist's site for data, which Craigslist did not approve of. Craigslist sent both companies a cease-and-desist letter and blocked their IP addresses, but this did not stop 3Taps from scraping through other IP addresses. Craigslist then sued, resulting in this case. In pre-trial motions 3Taps moved to dismiss the lawsuit on multiple grounds. In response, the court issued an order that set precedent on whether online hosts can use the CFAA to protect public data. The court held that sending a cease and desist letter and blocking a client's IP address are sufficient to qualify as notice under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The court also held that 3Taps should have known that Craigslist was revoking its authorization to access the site. The motion to dismiss was granted in part, and denied in part. On June 26, 2015, Craigslist came to separate settlements with 3Taps and Padmapper. Both settlements required the defendants to permanently stop taking content from Craigslist, directly or indirectly. 3taps paid $1,000,000 which Craigslist will donate to the EFF over ten years. Press coverage said that 3Taps would shut down, but as of July 16 it was still active with content from other sites.  Background  Craigslist is a website where users post and browse classified ads for, among other things, housing. PadMapper is a website specialized for browsing housing ads. PadMapper collected data from Craigslist and offered a map of the ads. 3Taps, a data scraping and hosting company, was also collecting data from Craigslist as part of a larger effort to gather public datasets. On 22 June 2012, Craigslist sent a cease-and-desist letter to PadMapper, requesting that PadMapper stop scraping Craigslist's real estate listings. Earlier in 2010, Craigslist's founder Craig Newmark had written that \\"we take issue with only services which consume a lot of bandwidth.\\" Craigslist also blocked PadMapper's and 3Taps's IP addresses from accessing its site, causing a significant drop in traffic to PadMapper. 3Taps continued to collect data from Craigslist by accessing the site through proxies, which allowed it to conceal its IP address and bypass Craigslist's block. On 9 July 2012, PadMapper restored its site by getting its data from 3Taps instead of directly from Craigslist. On July 16, 2012 Craigslist changed their terms of service to claim exclusive ownership, and exclusive right to enforce copyright of all postings made by users. Craigslist later rescinded these changes under pressure from the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others on August 8, 2012. On 20 July 2012, Craigslist sued both PadMapper and 3Taps. Craigslist's complaint specified several reasons that 3Taps's continued use of Craigslist was unlawful: it was in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act; it was a breach of Craigslist's terms of service contract; it infringed on Craigslist's copyright of the listings; it was also contributory copyright infringement, since 3Taps shared the listings with PadMapper; and it infringed on and diluted Craigslist's trademark. 3Taps opposed the claim that it violated the CFAA. On July 12, 2013 the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed an amicus brief in support of PadMapper and 3Taps.  Opinion of the court  On April 29, 2013 the court denied 3Taps' motion to dismiss Craigslists's CFAA claim. Most importantly the court held that Craigslist could continue its damages claim on posts made between July 16, 2012 and August 8, 2012. This was the period during which Craigslist had modified its terms of service to claim exclusive copyright on all postings.  Response of the court to 3Taps' arguments for dismissal  3Taps provided three reasons for dismissing the claim which the court granted in part, and dismissed in part. First, 3Taps argued that it had Craigslist's authorization to access the listings. The CFAA claim only applies to access of a protected computer system without authorization. It claimed that Craigslist was a public website, so anyone, including 3Taps, always had authorization. The court disagreed with this, stating that although Craigslist had granted 3Taps authorization initially, it then revoked the authorization. The court cited the case LVRC Holdings v. Brekka, in which the Ninth Circuit held that a former employee of an employer no longer had the employer's authorization to log into a work computer. Thus, the court held that 3Taps was unauthorized when it continued to access Craigslist after Craigslist rescinded the authorization. Second, 3Taps suggested that Craigslist had set restrictions on how 3Taps must use the data, rather than restricting 3Taps's access to the data altogether. 3Taps cited the Ninth Circuit's sentiment from United States v. Nosal that violating a use policy was less severe than violating an access restriction. The argument in Nosal was that use policies could be complex, while denying access is simple and easy to follow. Thus, it would be dangerous for the court to criminalize use violations. 3Taps likened Nosal to its own case, alleging that Craigslist had taken measures to prevent 3Taps from using the listings in a certain way, rather than enacting a straightforward access revocation. The court viewed it differently: it considered Craigslist's cease-and-desist letter and IP blocking as access revocation. The court pointed to language Craigslist's cease-and-desist letter affirming its interpretation, \\"You ... are hereby prohibited from accessing and using the CL Services for any reason.\\" Third, 3Taps warned of negative consequences of a decision that criminalizes a vague access restriction. It criticized Craigslist's enforcement as unclear about what exactly what it was prohibiting. 3Taps stated that an ordinary user would be more likely to misunderstand Cragslist's IP blocking than, for example, a system that required a password to gain access. The court found this not of much concern, highlighting that the personalized cease-and-desist letter and subsequent lawsuit provided adequate notice and information. This, the court found, would be sufficient in differentiating the case from more benign incidents where a user accidentally stumbles upon a protected system. The court admitted that it could not comment on whether it would consider Craigslist's IP blocking to be effective, but considered the fact that 3Taps went out of its way to bypass it as enough evidence that 3Taps acted without authorization. 3Taps also said that this decision would be a judgment on Internet culture. It promoted the idea of publicly accessible websites as a great social benefit, which a decision for permission controls would harm. It claimed that the CFAA was meant to protect private information against malicious hackers, and that it was not meant to limit the social benefit created by public data. It also predicted that a broad interpretation of the CFAA would limit competition and harm innovation, ultimately harming the openness of the Internet. The court refused to make a judgement on these matters; it considered those matters to be better handled through legislation. The court likened its decision to allowing a store to open itself to the public but also to ban a disruptive person if it needed to.  Reactions  The court, in many instances, pointed to Craigslist's cease-and-desist letter as evidence that 3Taps knew that its authorization had been revoked. Law professor Eric Goldman questioned this, stating that \\"[cease-and-desist letters] are wish lists by the senders. They describe what the sender wants to happen.\\" As such they may easily overstate what a defendant must lawfully do. Goldman found it troubling that the court had treated the cease and desist letter as a legally-binding document that revoked 3Taps's authorization to access Craigslist. Critics of the decision have called it anti-competitive. They claimed that this case sets a precedent that allows businesses to use the CFAA to keep public data away from competitors. Further, they highlighted that such a holding sets a precedent of marginalizing the public good for the prosperity of a single business. The case has also brought criticism towards Craigslist for enforcing its exclusive copyright of user-generated content. The critics pointed out that the entire lawsuit depended on a short, one-week- long period where Cragslist's terms of use required that users assign Craigslist the exclusive copyright of any posted content. While some users may be happy to have other companies use their classified ads, another reaction was that there may also be users who do not want it. Craigslist would be under similar criticism if it had allowed the sharing and violated these users' privacy expectations. The Electronic Frontier Foundation was critical of the court's decision to uphold Craiglist's copyright claim in their temporary terms of service between July 26, 2012 and August 8, 2012. Stating, \\"claiming an exclusive license to users' posts to the exclusion of everyone—including the original poster—threatens both innovation and users’ rights, and, even worse, sets terrible precedent.\\"  References  External links  * Commentary from Nick Akerman, in January 2014 frames this and three related cases in a survey of litigation surrounding the CFAA. * Craigslist v. 3Taps Inc., et al Full docket from the United States Courts Archive * Category:United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit cases Category:United States computer case law Category:United States Internet case law Category:2013 in United States case law Category:Craigslist ","title":"Craigslist Inc. v. 3Taps Inc."},{"id":"41858849","text":"The Committee on Ethnic Minority Affairs () is a ministry-level agency in Vietnam that exercises the functions of state management on ethnic minority affairs nationwide.

She is the first African American woman to anchor a nightly newscast in Cleveland, and the first solo anchor of a weeknight newscast in that city. She is a member of the Ohio Broadcasters Hall of Fame and the Cleveland Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame, and is an eight-time recipient of the Lower Great Lakes Emmy Awards. She currently appears weeknights on CBS affiliate WOIO Channel 19. Early life and education Robinson was born in 1959 in Wilson City, Missouri. She was one of 10 girls and one boy in her family. Her mother, Henrietta Robinson, was a seamstress and maintained a small farm behind their house. Romona earned a bachelor's degree in broadcast journalism at Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri. Career Robinson entered the broadcasting field in 1981 as a record player at a country-western music station in Jefferson City, Missouri. In 1982 she joined a television station as a sports reporter and weekend news anchor. In 1985 she moved to Charleston, South Carolina, to take up a television news anchor position. In 1987 she applied for a news anchor position at the new 10 O'Clock News newscast at WUAB in Cleveland, Ohio. Her demo tape included \\"a shot of her being wiped out by a hurricane-whipped wave\\", which impressed the producers due to her poise and self-confidence. Her appointment made her the first African-American woman to anchor a nightly newscast in Cleveland.

The new edition includes images of many of the inscriptions it describes, as well as a new seventh chapter consisting of five parts. The new edition of the book has been published under a different title: Persian Inscriptions on the Indian World Heritage Sites. because many of the stone inscriptions it describes have been preserved and registered as world heritage The new edition contains more than 120 images. Book contents  In India, Persian inscriptions are usually found on buildings such as mosques and tombs, or on secular edifices including forts, palaces, gateways, water tanks, wells, gardens and bridges. Certain movable objects such as seals, signets, vases and eating utensils often bear inscriptions too. Most pre-Mughal Indian Islamic and Persian inscriptions in India date from the last decade of the 12th century AD, when Muhammad Ghori (Guri) conquered Delhi and established his sultanate there. However, a small number of inscriptions have been found in Haryana, Gujarat and Kerala which bear earlier dates. In Persian, Arabic and (more recently) Urdu inscriptions found in India, the dynasties represented most prominently are the Mamluks, the Khaljis, the Tughluqs, the Sayyids, the Lodis, the Mughals and Surs (in the center). Many other regional dynasties also receive prominent representation in inscriptions within India. When the powerful Mughals and (khorasanid) dynasties assumed power, they used Persian as the main language for all academic and administrative matters, including inscriptions, coins, official letters and many others. Under the later Mughals, many of the regional principalities became autonomous and continued using Persian as their official language. Later, when Urdu came into wider use, its existence was also recorded in inscriptions. Persian inscriptions on Indian monuments In addition to Arabic, Persian and Urdu inscriptions, there are also bilingual and even trilingual inscriptions (for example, in Arabic combined with regional languages such as Gujarati, Bengali, Tamil and Malayalam, or Persian combined with provincial languages such as Kannada, Telugu, Oriya, Tamil, Gujarati and Marathi). Persian and mixed Quranic Arabic with Persian have been used alongside many other languages, including Sanskrit, Hindi, English, Portuguese and many others. Examples of such inscriptions can be found in Qutb Minar at New Delhi, the Tomb of Akbar the Great at Sikandara, the Adina Mosque at Pandua (Bengal), the Taj Mahal at Agra and many other locations. In addition, Arabic and Persian inscriptions can be found written in various different popular scripts or styles of Islamic Persian Calligraphy, including Kufi, Naskh, Thuluth, Riqa and Nastaliq.Persian Inscriptions on Indian Monuments Dr.Mohammad Ajam The book describes many palaces, forts, tombs and mosques inscribed with Persian Inscriptions. Persian inscriptions on Indian monuments Mughal dynasty or Mughal Persian dynasty who originally came from great Khorasan and are known in Iran and Afghanistan as the Gourkanid dynasty also had link to (Ghurid dynasty). Mughal Persian dynasty begins with Babur a Persian word means Tiger. His grandson Akbar developed Indo-Persian culture and the Mughal architecture style developed vigorously during his reign. Among his accomplishments were Agra Fort, the fort-city of Fatehpur Sikri, and the Buland Darwaza. Akbar's son Jahangir commissioned the Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir and Humayun's Tomb. *Indo-Persian culture reached its zenith during the reign of Shah Jahan, who constructed Taj Mahal, the Jama Masjid, the Shalimar Gardens of Lahore, the Wazir Khan Mosque, and who renovated the Lahore Fort. The last of the great Mughal architects was Aurangzeb, who built the Badshahi Mosque. First chapter The first chapter of the book is dedicated to the history of Persian inscription in India, describing the history of epigraphy up to the initial development of Islam and beyond. Sassanid Persian inscriptions can be found in the Ajanta cave, on many coins dating from the reign of Pulakesin II and on the crosses of churches such as St. Thomas Mount and San Thome Basilica in Chennai and St. Mary's Orthodox Valiyapally in Bangalore. . 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

Mughal gardens This style was influenced by Persian gardens. Humayun's Tomb, was the first sample of later Mughal gardens. First part of the Third edition  The first part from the new edition chapter added in 2013 contains a selection of Persian inscriptions found on the Hyderabad Monuments, dating from the time of the Qutb Shahi dynasty. It also contains inscriptions from the Golkonda fort and the Deccan in the Andhra Pradesh. Golconda Fort, Hyderabad Under the Mughals (1526-1858), Persian replaced Arabic almost throughout the region. The case is more or less the same in the southeastern and southernmost strip comprising the present Indian state of Tamil Nadu, which during a brief spell of Muslim authority there, in the mid-14th century, under the Madura sultanate, and then under the Qoṭbšāhī rulers and the Mughals in the 17th and 18th centuries, and the semi-independent nawwābs of Karnataka, saw extensive use of Persian. Likewise, in easternmost Bengal the epigraphic language was almost exclusively Arabic until the Mughal period, when it was totally replaced by Persian. In Orissa and Assam, which effectively came under Muslim authority in the 17th century, Persian was the language of epigraphs. In westernmost Gujarat, one encounters a curious phenomenon: both prose and verse epigraphs of the Delhi sultanate period (1296-1406), are generally in Persian, but later replaced by Arabic under the Gujarat sultans (1406-1580).The epigraphs of the 16th-17th century ʿĀdelšāhī (924-1097/1518-1686, q.v.) and Qoṭbšāhī (924-1098 /1518-1687) rulers of Bijapur and Golkonda-Hyderabad, respectively, who also had close relations with Persia, furnish better poetry. Surprisingly, in the above-mentioned small chiefdoms, as in parts of Tamil Nadu under the nawwābs of Karnataka, a considerable number of fairly high quality records is found. Second part of the new edition Importance of the epigraphs ,Calligraphic inscriptions constitute the most important decorative element in Indian Islamic Architecture which attained a high level of perfection in Qutb Minar at Delhi, Adina Mosque at Pandua (in Bengal), Atala Mosque at Jaunpur, Jami Mosques at Ahmedabad, Golconda and Hyderabad, Akbar’s tomb at Sikandra, Ibrahim Rauda at Bijapur and Taj Mahal at Agra.With the help of these epigraphs, we can prepare a list of calligraphers, region-wise and period- wise, whose beautiful calligraphy adorns so many buildings in the width and breadth of the country. Scripts employed in the Perso-Arabic epigraphs include Kufi, Naskh, Thulth and Nastaliq. The second part contains details of Persian epigraphy on Bengal stones. Third part The third part deals with the Mughal/Persian architecture in India. The influence Persian-style architecture and language in India began with the Tughlaq dynasty; in addition, all the ruling dynasties after them were originally from Greater Khorasan, an area dominated by Persian language and culture. The Mughal dynasty also came from Greater Khorasan, which is why the book describes Mughal architecture as the Khorasanid or Persian style of architecture. 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Qutub Minar, a prominent example of Islamic architecture in India. Mughal tombs, made from sandstone and marble, emphasise the Persian influence.Encyclopædia Britannica (2008), Mughal architecture. Among the architectural achievements of this era are the Red Fort at Agra (1565–74) and the walled city of Fatehpur Sikri (1569–74), as well as the Taj Mahal, which was built as a tomb for Queen Mumtaz Mahal by Shah Jahan (1628–58). With its double dome, its recessed archway, its white marble and its parks, as well as the emphasis on symmetry and detail, this building contains many of the key elements of architecture from the period of Shah Jahan.Encyclopædia Britannica (2008), Shāh Jahān period architecture. Verses from the Quran were inscribed on the walls of the buildings; problematically, though the depiction of living beings (which was an essential part of the pre- Islamic artistic tradition of India) is forbidden by the Islamic religion. Fourth part The fourth part describes the Persian language and its influence over other languages such as Hindi, Urdu and Turkic. During the last four decades over 10,000 inscriptions have been copied from different parts of the India and duly accessioned, deciphered and listed in the Annual Reports on Indian Epigraphy (ARE) since 1952-53 onwards, under a separate Appendix with an exhaustive introduction. Among the Indian states, Uttar Pradesh has yielded the largest number of Perso-Arabic epigraphs (i.e. 2175), constituting 21.4 % of the aggregate, number-wise followed by Maharashtra (over 14%), Gujarat (over 9%), Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh (about 9%), Rajasthan (about 8%), Kamataka (7%), West Bengal (4%), Bihar, and Jammu & Kashmir (about 4% each), Tamil Nadu (2.55%), Haryana (2%), Delhi (about 2%). About 2,000 Perso-Arabic inscriptions have been published so far in Epigraphia Indo-Moslemica (ElM) and Epigraphia Indica-Arabic and Persian Supplement (EIAPS) from 1907-08 to 1977.[] Fifth part The fifth part contains some samples of royal orders, including government instructions, and copies of the Persian drawings found in the museums of Hyderabad and Delhi. we also come across epigraphical texts composed by rulers like Adil Shahi king Ali II (1656-71), Mughal king BahadurShah II (1837-57) and Nawwab of Awadh Wajid Ali Shah (1848-56). A vast majority of these poets mentioned in epigraphs are unknown from available sources. those of the Sultanate period, covering approximately 12th to 15th centuries (7th -9th cent. H.) are particularly valuable. The places, to quote a few, where this phenomenon occurred are : Cambay in the 12th to 14th centuries, Karad (Maharashtra) in the 16th century, Hyderabad in the 17th century, Lucknow, Allahabad, Kashmir etc. in the subsequent period. Indian monuments with Persian inscriptions According to the book Persian Inscriptions on Indian Monuments, there are nearly 15,000 examples of Persian and Quranic inscriptions in India, mostly found in cities such as Hyderabad, Delhi, Agra and Lucknow, amongst others. The list of historical Indian monuments containing Persian inscriptions and Persian calligraphy includes the following: Asfi Mosque, Bara Imambara, Lucknow * The Qutub Minar * The Red Fort * Humayun's Tomb * Akbar's tomb * Rashtrapati Bhavan * The Lodhi Gardens * Purana Quila * Safdarjung's Tomb * Qutb complex * Mehrauli in South Delhi. Mehrauli was built by Qutub-ud-din Aibak and heralded the beginning of a new style of art and architecture which came to be known as the Indo-Islamic style. Other monuments included in the Qutub complex are the Jamali Kamali Mosque and Tomb, Balban's tomb, Quli Khan's Tomb, Rajon Ki Baoli in Mehrauli Archaeological Park. In addition, Jahaz Mahal and Adham Khan's Tomb are located on a hilltop nearby.
