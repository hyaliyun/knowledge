They are located around the walls of the Gwalior Fort, Madhya Pradesh. They depict Tirthankaras in seated Padmasana posture as well as standing Kayotsarga posture, in the typical naked form of Jain iconography. The number of Jain rock shrines at Gwalior, with numerous monumental statues, is unmatched anywhere else. James Burgess writes: \\"In the 15th century, during the reign of the Tomara Rajas, the Jains seem to have been seized with an uncontrollable impulse to convert the cliff that sustains the fort into a great shrine in honour of their religion, and in a few years excavated the most extensive series of Jaina caves known to exist anywhere.\\"The Cave Temples Of India, James Burgess, 1880, p. 509 Location Gwalior Fort plan 1901 showing locations of the five groups of monuments The Gopachal rock-cut Jain monuments are located on the rock cliffs of the hill topped by the Gwalior Fort, Madhya Pradesh.

The group is the first one encountered when driving to the Urvai Gate, just outside the fortifications. There are the oldest Jain monuments in Gwalior from the post-Gupta period. Archaeologist L.B. Singh dates them to 6th to 8th cent AD.L. B. Singh, Puratattva, May 2005 * Urvahi group: In both sides of the road, just before entering the hilltop fort gate. These are the most visited since they are visible from the road itself. There are six inscriptions from 1440‚Äì1453 AD. * North-West group: Now termed Naminath Giri group after Lord Naminath. They are hard to access. There is an inscription of 1470 AD. The group appears to have escaped the destruction by Babur, and thus the monumental image of Lord Naminath is in its pristine form. * North-East group: Now termed Naimgir group after Lord Neminath. Alexander Cunningham noted a Jain temple converted into a mosque just north of the Sas-Bahu temples in the fort containing a Jain inscription of AD 1108. Also within the fort there is an abandoned Jain temple which is now within the Scindia School playground and thus no longer accessible. Several large Jain sculptures are placed within the Teli ka Mandir compound. The Gwalior city and the fort is connected to other Indian cities by major highways NH 44 and 46 (Asian Highway 43 and 47), a railway station and airport (IATA: GWL). It is located near other historic Hindu and Jain temples from the medieval era.Group of temples at Batesar, ASI Bhopal Circle (2014)Naresar Temples, ASI Bhopal Circle (2014) History The Gopachal rock- cut monuments are a part of nearly 100 Jain monuments found in and around the Gwalior city, but these are dated earlier than the Siddhachal Caves located about north of these monuments. Both monuments were defaced and desecrated around 1527 when the Emperor Babur ordered their destruction.Gwalior Fort: Rock Sculptures, A Cunningham, Archaeological Survey of India, pages 364-370, Quote: \\"In 1527, the Urvahi Jinas were mutilated by the Mughal emperor Babar, a fact he records in his memoirs\\". Centuries later, the Jain community restored many of the statues by adding back stucco heads on the top of the damaged idols. The prolific Apabhramsha author Raidhu was responsible for consecrating many of the Jain rock carved images as attested by multiple inscriptions. These include the two colossal images of Shri Adinatha (57 feet) and Shri Chandraprabha. Kurbuddin Aibak captured the fort from Parihars in 1196 AD and held it until his death in 1210. Altmash captured the fort in 1232 and built the fortifications at the Urvahi gate. The Tomars acquired control in 1394 and held it until 1517. Mughal Emperor Babar conquered Gwalior in AD 1527. Babar ordered the destruction of the Jain statues, as he mentions in his memoirs. The heads of the statues at Urvahi gate and the Ek Patthat ki Bawadi were damaged. The Urvahi gate sculptures were repaired at some later time by the local Jains. The South-West Group and North West group sculptures survived because they were in inconspicuous and hard to reach places. and The Mughals kept control until Muhammad Shah. Scindias, the Maratha clan, took control in 1731. Shortly before that, Jain temples were constructed again in Gwalior city in 1704 AD, including the Jain Golden Temple, Gwalior.‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§á‡§ï‡§≤‡•å‡§§‡§æ ‡§ú‡•à‡§® ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§£ ‡§Æ‡§Ç‡§¶‡§ø‡§∞, ‡§á‡§∏‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§¶‡•Ä‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ú‡§°‡§º‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ã‡§°‡§º‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§∏‡•ã‡§®‡§æ, Dainik Bhaskar, Aug 31, 2015  Description  The Gopachal rock-cut monuments depict the Tirthankaras in seated or standing meditating positions.

Origins A small greyhound track existed off the east side of the Perry Hill Road (which goes north from Lower Sydenham towards Catford Bridge) at the end of Rubens Street. In 1930 three fields made up the green space of the area, the African Banks Athletic Ground, the City of London School Athletic Ground and the Forest Hill Cricket Ground. One of these was described and was also known by locals as the 'Dog Field' and evidence points to the latter being the field in question. History The track opened in the early 1930s and was originally independent (unaffiliated to a governing body). In 1933 Mr Herbert Blann the co-manager of the track and residing in Rubens Street appeared in court to answer the allegations of using live rabbits to train greyhounds at Perry Hill, Forest Hill Greyhound Track. It is probable that the management changed due to the fact that the track became affiliated to the British Greyhound Tracks Control Society (BGTCS), an organisation formed to assist tracks wishing to race under regulations and a rival to the bigger National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC). In addition the track had basic tote facilities which also means that there were buildings on site although not necessarily substantial brick ones. The track was issued a betting licence in February 1935 but the BGTCS disbanded in 1935 leaving the stadium unaffiliated. Midget Cars Midget car racing took place for the first time at the Perry Hill Stadium on 7 June 1935. Closure Business was hit by the construction of the nearby Catford Stadium in 1932 which left Perry Hill in a precarious position. The stadium was wound up in November 1935 and the business went on public sale in December offering a significant package. Today the site is the Catford and Cyphers Cricket Club Ground.

History The infantry barracks, which were built on the south side of the Glasgow Road in the Williamsburgh district of Paisley as part of the response to the Radical War, were completed in 1822. The Earl of Glasgow used the infantry barracks to raise a regiment of yeomanry and a volunteer rifle corps. Units subsequently based at the infantry barracks in the 1820s included the 10th Hussars and the 13th Regiment of Foot. As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 26th (Cameronian) Regiment of Foot was linked with the 74th (Highland) Regiment, and both were temporarily based at the barracks.Johnston, pp. 262‚Äì263. These regiments moved out to Hamilton Barracks in Hamilton a few years later and the infantry barracks were disused and empty by 1882. The militia barracks, which were built on the north side of the Glasgow Road in the Whitehaugh district of Paisley, were also completed in the 1820s. The 4th (Extra Reserve) Battalion, the 1/6th (Renfrewshire) Battalion and the 2/6th (Renfrewshire) Battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders were all raised at the barracks at the start of the First World War. Part of the site formerly occupied by the militia barracks was redeveloped for the Kelburne Cinema in 1933.

Operational history The minesweeper was ordered as part of the 1941‚Äì1942 construction programme. The ship's keel was laid down on 2 January 1942 by Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co at their yard in Port Arthur, Ontario. Named for a community in Alberta, Blairmore was launched on 14 May 1942. The ship was commissioned on 17 November 1942 at Port Arthur.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 190 After arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 24 December 1942, the minesweeper was assigned to Western Local Escort Force as a convoy escort. In June 1943, the force was re-organized into escort groups and Blairmore joined W-4. The ship served with W-4 until February 1944. That month, the minesweeper was ordered to European waters as part of Canada's contribution to the invasion of Normandy. Upon arrival in March, Blairmore was assigned to the 31st Minesweeping Flotilla.Schull, p. 233 During the invasion, Blairmore and her fellow minesweepers swept and marked channels through the German minefields leading into the invasion beaches in the American sector.Schull, pp. 233‚Äì234 The 31st Minesweeping Flotilla swept channel 3 on 6 June, completing the task unmolested by the Germans.Schull, pp. 270‚Äì273 The minesweepers spent the following months clearing the shipping lanes between the United Kingdom and mainland Europe. On 8 October 1944, the 31st Minesweeping Flotilla was sweeping for mines off Le Havre, France when sister ship suffered an explosion. The minesweeper had hit a mine and after damage control efforts saved the ship, Blairmore took the vessel in tow and brought her to Le Havre.Douglas et al., A Blue Water Navy, p. 334 In April 1945, the ship sailed to Canada for a refit at Halifax and returned to Plymouth in July. The minesweeper remained in European waters attached to Plymouth Command until 21 September 1945. After returning to Canada, the minesweeper was paid off at Sydney, Nova Scotia on 16 October 1945. Blairmore was sold to Marine Industries and placed in strategic reserve at Sorel, Quebec in 1946. In July 1951 the minesweeper was reacquired by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Korean War. The vessel was taken to Sydney, Nova Scotia and given the new hull number FSE 193 and re-designated a coastal escort.Blackman, p. 99 However, the ship never recommissioned and remained in reserve at Sydney until 29 March 1958 when Blairmore was formally transferred to the Turkish Navy.Colledge, p. 401 Renamed Beycoz by the Turkish Navy, the vessel remained in service until 1971 when it was discarded.

Thamrin, Jakarta, Indonesia. Constructed from 1964 to 1969, Wisma Nusantara was amongst the first highrise buildings in Indonesia. The building complex included the Pullman Hotel. History The construction of Wisma Nusantara was inspired by President Sukarno's intention to have the first high rise building in Jakarta. The first contract was awarded in 1964 for $5.7 million using the Japanese war reparation and construction commenced in the same year. However, the decline of the rupiah and the attempted coup d'etat interrupted the construction of Wisma Nusantara. As a result the money ran out, leaving the building unfinished with only its steel frame completed for more than 5 years. Construction work was continued by Mitsui Construction Co. in 1972 after the renewal of the contract. Wiratman Wangsadinata, the founder of PT. Wiratman & Associates, was chosen as the supervisor of the project in 1970. The building was finally completed in 1972. It was officially inaugurated by President Suharto on December 2, 1972, together with the adjacent President Hotel (now Pullman Hotel). As part of the deal, the share was held by Mitsui 55% and the Indonesian Government 45%. Because of the considerably high cost of renting office space, the building was only used by Japanese companies for a couple of years. Because of this, the building stimulated the antipathy of Indonesian citizens. The building was at one time topped with a large sign of Suzuki. An Indonesian movie directed by Sjumandjaja Budak Nafsu (1984), literally \\"slave to lust\\", depicts a scene where a young woman was raped and made a concubine for the Japanese during the war, and having lost her energy for life, wanders around Jakarta surrounded by neon signs of Japanese enterprises on Jalan M.H. Thamrin, which clearly shows sentiment toward the Japanese in Indonesia during the period. The first major renovation was done in 1990 which consist of JICA building construction. The connecting bridge between Wisma Nusantara office building and the hotel (then known as Nikko Hotel) was built in 2002. In 2003, Nikko Hotel was expanded with an additional 11-story executive suite tower to the north of the Wisma Nusantara complex. This hotel tower was designed by Kenzo Tange International. In 2005, the Annex Building was completed to accommodate parking. Design Wisma Nusantara was constructed with a steel frame and a caisson foundation for resistance to earthquakes.

She was born in Brazil in 1853, the daughter of James Cooley Fletcher (1823-1901) and granddaughter of the banker Calvin Fletcher. Her mother was Henriette Malan, the daughter of a Swiss clergyman. She went to Abbot Academy, in Andover, Massachusetts, and was in the class of 1867. After her parents' divorce, Julia went to live with her mother in Venice. Henriette had remarried, her second husband being a painter, Eugene Benson. Julia also spent some time in London. One of the sponsors of her early novels was Alfred Sassoon, a junior member of the wealthy Sassoon family and the father of Siegfried Sassoon. Alfred's infatuation with Julia was the catalyst for his desertion of his wife, Theresa. Julia's other supporters included her grandfather's friend Henry James, and she also knew Rudyard Kipling, Robert Browning and Walter Pater. Two of her books, Kismet and Mirage, were published as \\"no name novels\\" by Roberts Brothers in Boston. Both books deal with Americans' adventures while traveling abroad, along the Nile and in Syria, respectively. Mirage has been described by Oscar Wilde scholar S. I. Salamensky, as a roman-√°-clef fiction in which \\"a dangerously appealing, if slightly bi- or asexual, figure based on Wilde romantically pursues\\" a woman who is thought to represent Fletcher. In 1900 she wrote a translation/adaptation of Edmond Rostand's play Les Romanesques, which she titled The Fantasticks.

Early life and family Sydney Eardley-Wilmot was born at Mortlake, Surrey, on 3 October 1847, the fifth son of Sir John Eardley-Wilmot, 2nd Baronet,\\"Wills and Bequests\\", The Times, 10 June 1929, p. 18. member of Parliament, judge, and author. He was educated at the academy of the Reverend W. Foster at Stubbington, Fareham. Eardley-Wilmot married Grace Hoare, daughter of Thomas R. Hoare of Burton Park, Petworth, in 1877 and they had one son and two daughters. Career Eardley-Wilmot was born into a military family - he had four elder brothers, three of whom (William, Revell and Frederick) were army officers. He joined the Royal Navy on 9 June 1860 and served on HMS Emerald and HMS Duncan as a midshipman. He received the Canadian General Service Medal in 1866 for services related to the Fenian raids of 1866.\\"EARDLEY-WILMOT, Rear-Adm. Sir Sydney (Marow)\\", Who Was Who, online edition, Oxford University Press, 2015. Retrieved 9 November 2016. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in 1869. In January 1870, he joined in the Pacific on which he served for three years and about which he later edited an account of the voyage given by the officers. He was then posted to HMS Excellent to train as a gunnery lieutenant where he served under and was influenced by Commander John Fisher, later Lord Fisher, with whom he became close friends. In April 1876, he became a gunnery lieutenant on , a corvette in the Mediterranean, but in February 1877 transferred to the recently established torpedo school at as a first lieutenant. During his time there he suffered injuries in an explosion which necessitated the amputation of a hand. In January 1881, Eardley-Wilmot was promoted to commander and transferred to the Admiralty for three years until May 1884 when he took command of , a composite sloop, in the Mediterranean where the ship took part in military operations in eastern Sudan in 1884‚Äì1885. He was at Suakin and took part in defending attacks on the camp there. He took part in the blockade of the coast of Greece. He received the Egypt Medal (second version) with Suakin clasp and the accompanying Khedive's Bronze Star. At an unknown date he received the Order of Osmanieh, fourth class, of the Ottoman Empire. Eardley-Wilmot was promoted to the rank of captain in June 1886 and in February 1887 became assistant director of the Naval Intelligence Department, a position he held until April 1890. In August 1893, he was placed on the Royal Navy retired list and in March 1901 promoted to the rank of rear-admiral on the retired list. In February 1902 he was appointed Superintendent of Ordnance Stores at the Admiralty during the period of the Anglo-German naval arms race when the Dreadnought Fleet was developed.The War at sea. Louise Bruton, British Library. Retrieved 10 November 2016. He consistently advocated for the construction of the largest naval guns possible. In 1908, he was knighted for his service at the Admiralty. Writing Eardley-Wilmot produced a number of books, all of which related to the Royal Navy, its history, development, and future. Among them were two novels that reflected the changing military threats facing Britain during his career. His first novel, The Next Naval War (1894) described a possible sea war with France, but by the time he produced The Battle of the North Sea in 1912, the enemy had become Germany. The novels were compared and contrasted at a seminar held at the National Museum of the Royal Navy in 2015.Research Seminar: Sydney Marrow Eardley-Wilmot and The battle of the North Sea.

GOARN works closely with and under the World Health Organization (WHO), which is one of its most notable partners. Its goals are to: examine and study diseases, evaluate the risks that certain diseases pose, and improve international capability to deal with diseases. Creation The World Health Organization realized at the start of the 21st century that it did not have the resources required to adequately respond to and prevent epidemics around the world. Thus, a \\"Framework for Global Outbreak and Response\\" was created by the Department of Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Response, and Regional Offices. This framework was put then forth in a meeting in Geneva from April 26‚Äì28, 2000. In this meeting, which was attended by 121 representatives from 67 institutions, the decision was made to form GOARN to contribute resources, coordination, surveillance, and technical assistance towards combating diseases. It was decided that GOARN would be directed by a steering committee made of 20 representatives of GOARN partners and an operational support team (OST) based in WHO. The steering committee oversees and plans the activities of GOARN, and the OST is composed of a minimum of 5‚Äì6 WHO staff. Task forces and groups were established to deal with specific issues. GOARN resources are primarily coordinated by the World Health Organization. Goals The WHO's guiding principles are to standardize \\"epidemiological, laboratory, clinical management, research, communication, logistics, support, security, evacuation, and communication systems\\" and coordinative international resources to support local efforts by GOARN partners to combat outbreaks. It also focuses on improving long term ability to provide technical assistance to affected areas. Partners GOARN has grown to now have over 600 partners in the form of public health institutions, networks, laboratories, and United Nations and non-governmental organizations. Technical institutions, networks, and organizations that have the ability to improve GOARN's capabilities are eligible for partnership. Through its partners, GOARN is staffed by a variety of individuals who specialize in public health, such as \\"doctors, nurses, infection control specialists, logisticians, laboratory specialists; communication, anthropology and social mobilization experts, emergency management and public health professionals among others.\\" As its biggest partner, WHO plays a large role in GOARN. Alongside coordinating its resources to combat outbreaks, WHO provides much of the staffing and assistance for GOARN, though as will be covered later, does not fund GOARN directly. Since the network is primarily led by the WHO, there is some uncertainty as to whether WHO should be considered a partner in GOARN or if the network should be considered a WHO initiative. Another notable partner is the Center for Disease Control, which sends technical resources and staff to GOARN. The CDC also has a history of resource sharing and cooperation with WHO in order to combat disease. Budget The WHO does not directly fund GOARN. Instead, GOARN members and outside fundraising that is carried out each time there is a new incidence is used to support the GOARN response. The Nuclear Threat Initiative provides GOARN with US$500,000 as a revolving fund, meant to be used for quickly mobilizing response teams. This is known as the WHO-NTI Global Emergency Response Fund, and must be repaid after withdrawal. The GOARN is effective at operating from a fairly small budget. Field missions GOARN has responded to over 120 occurrences in 85 countries and has deployed over 2,300 experts into the field. Some examples of deployments are the SARS outbreak in Asia in 2003, Rift Valley fever, and the nipah virus around the Indian subcontinent. Field missions overview Since its creation, GOARN cooperated with various other organizations to control outbreaks and improve national capacity to respond to diseases. A brief history of GOARN's work against international diseases is as follows. In 2000‚Äì2003, GOARN primarily responded to outbreaks of diseases such as cholera, meningitis, and yellow fever in Africa. It supported field investigation and outbreak containment. In 2003, GOARN helped to deploy international teams and helped to coordinate the response against SARS. In 2004, the network was one of the first to deploy against H5N1 influenza. In April‚ÄìJuly 2005, GOARN helped to control Marburg Hemorrhagic fever in Angola. It carried out some \\"risk assessment and preparedness missions\\" in 2006, along with some response to human bird flu. In 2008/2009, GOARN responded to cholera in Zimbabwe. GOARN and SARS GOARN played a role in containing the 2003 SARS outbreak in Asia. The network sent teams of experts in epidemiology, microbiology/virology, and infection control to Hanoi, Vietnam on March 14, 2003 and then Beijing China on March 25, 2003. GOARN assisted during this outbreak to not only study the outbreak and provide assistance, but also facilitate communication between the Department of Health (Hong Kong) and the WHO. Earliest signs of the outbreak in China were reported February 11‚Äì24, when multiple people were reported to contract the disease. WHO was notified February 28 and then directly notified GOARN March 13. The first members of a WHO/GOARN outbreak control team arrived in Hong Kong March 14, followed by another 5-person GOARN team 12 days later. This second team transitioned to Guangdong, where they investigated the earliest cases of SARS and conducted interviews with health staff. The outbreak was declared by WHO to be contained by July 5. Worldwide, GOARN carried out many of the operations for the initial response to SARS through the mobilization of field teams. Also through GOARN, the WHO developed many international networks to create tools and standards for containing the epidemic. These networks communicated data by teleconference and use of secure websites for sharing of information. Besides these networks and field teams, GOARN also assisted nations by directly providing assistance to affected areas and improving their capacity to respond to such threats in the future. GOARN's role in the outbreak was recognized by the World Health Assembly during the 56th Assembly in resolution WHA56.29. GOARN and Ebola On March 23, 2014, the first reports of Ebola in Guinea were reported by WHO's Regional Office in Africa. Five days later, the first GOARN team was sent to Guinea. This team found the situation to be quite severe and its findings were discussed in a press conference in Geneva April 8. In the third week of April, WHO collaborated with GOARN to send a new medical team trained in infection prevention/control and intensive care to Guinea's principal hospital, Donka Hospital. Two weeks later, on May 5, WHO deployed experts, thirty three of whom were from GOARN, to West Africa to assist in the response to the outbreak. The outbreak was detected to have spread to Sierre Leone later in the month. On June 23, a GOARN steering committee session sent a message to WHO requesting for WHO to lead the response more strongly because it was the only agency with the resources and staff to do so. Over the course of the outbreak, the network deployed 895 experts, including \\"doctors, nurses, infection control specialists, logisticians, laboratory specialists; communication, anthropology and social mobilisation experts, emergency management and public health professionals.\\" The network is still involved in the response to Ebola. GOARN and cholera In Sierre Leone, GOARN has sent case management and laboratory experts from the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh to help train the response capacity of health care and laboratory workers case management and diagnosis. In Northern Iraq, the Syrian Civil War displaced many refugees into the Kurdistan. The refugee camps suffer from poor sanitation, which has led to cholera outbreaks in the region in 2007 and 2012. GOARN, as per the request of the Ministry of Health of Iraq for support and training in outbreak response, deployed a multidisciplinary team of six experts to the North-Iraqi Dohuk and Erbil camps to assist with assessing the risk of cholera and other diseases as well as assisting MoH to prepare for response to the diseases. GOARN and H1N1 GOARN supported countries and various other outbreak control organizations to fight against the H1N1 outbreak in the US and Mexico. The GOARN alert and request for assistance started in Mexico April 24, 2009. Over the course of the outbreak, GOARN helped the Pan American Health Organization coordinate and exchange information with the CDC and Public Health Agency of Canada. It was provided with support and training from the Regional Office for the Western Pacific Response so that it could support regional offices in Manila and carry out field missions in Malaysia and Mongolia. The network carried out a joint training course with the Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean in Cairo. All in all, GOARN carried out 188 missions to 27 countries to strengthen international coordination between these organizations and to improve international capacity to respond to threats. Its activities consisted of assessment of the situation, communication between partners, infection control, laboratory diagnostic, and transportation of specimens.

It preserves a rugged area of Atlantic Forest that is important as a home for several species of rare or endangered birds. Location The Murici Ecological Station (ESEC) is divided between the municipalities of Flexeiras (38.01%), Messias (0.86%) and Murici (61.2%) in Alagoas. It has an area of . The ESEC is in the northwestern region of Alagoas, in an area that has been degraded by sugarcane plantations and cattle ranching. The ESEC is used only by researchers and for environmental education. Most of the station is in the Borborema Plateau, but parts of the east of the ESEC are in the coastal sedimentary tablelands. Elevations range from . History The Murici Environmental Protection Area was created by state law 5,907 of 14 March 1997 to provide a buffer zone for the ESEC. The Murici Ecological Station was created by federal decree on 28 May 2001. The consultative council was created on 21 November 2002. It is classed as IUCN protected area category Ia (strict nature reserve). The purpose is to preserve nature and undertake scientific research. The area is considered a priority for the preservation of birds. The ESEC is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). As of 2006 land ownership had still not been regularized. Since some undisturbed land lay outside the ESEC, and some land within the ESEC was disturbed, adjustments to the boundaries could be warranted. Environment The rainy season is from April to August, with the highest rainfall in May and July. Annual rainfall ranges from . The ESEC has many springs, gullies and streams that feed the Munda√∫ River. The water supply for the Fleixeiras municipality comes from the ESEC. Temperatures range from , with an average of . The dominant vegetation is dense rainforest in the Atlantic Forest biome. In the best preserved areas, mostly at the higher elevations, the forest forms a fairly uniform closed canopy up to high that provides shade and retains moisture. Tree species include murici (Byrsonima sericea), Schefflera morototoni, Parkia pendula, Tabebuia species, Pseudobombax species, Bowdichia virgilioides, Tapirira guianensis, Handroanthus impetiginosus and Protium species. The understory contains seedlings of trees, palms such as Euterpe catinga, and many lianas and epiphytes, such as Araceae, Orchidaceae (dimerandra species, Dichaea species, Rodriguezia species, Cattleya labiata, Pleurothallis species, Epidendrum species, Oncidium species and Cattleya granulosa), Bromeliaceae (Cryptanthus species, Aechmea fulgens, Tillandsia species) and Marantaceae. Plants with medicinal uses include Ficus, Lecythis and Aspidosperma species, and Abarema cochliocarpos. This last, widely used as a medicinal plant, is threatened with extinction in the Atlantic Forest. There is high diversity of animal species. The ESEC has 13 species of endangered birds, two of which are endemic, the Alagoas foliage-gleaner (Philydor novaesi) and the Alagoas antwren (Myrmotherula snowi). Other species are orange-bellied antwren (Terenura sicki), Alagoas tyrannulet (Phylloscartes ceciliae) and the snake Bothrops muriciensis. Threats The unit suffers from subsistence hunting by local residents and sports hunting by people from other locations. The most hunted species are paca, agouti and armadillo. Hunters have built wooden hides in the trees throughout the ESEC. Capture of birds for pets is also a constant problem. There is a risk of removal of trees for their lumber or to make charcoal, facilitated by the nearby BR-101 highway. The areas of permanent preservation are not respected by the local population, but are cleared for subsistence farming, sugarcane and pasture. Part of the problem is the lack of compensation to former owners for the land incorporated in the ESEC.

Laser warners 2\\\\. Flare launchers (IR decoys) 3\\\\. Chaff dispensers 4\\\\. Missile warners 5\\\\. Wingtip pods for ESCM 6\\\\. Towed decoy The Leonardo's Praetorian DASS is an integral part of Eurofighter Typhoon defensive Aid Sub-System (DASS) providing threat assessment, aircraft protection and support measures in extremely hostile and severe environments. As the DASS is fully integrated, it doesn‚Äôt require additional pods that take up weapon stations or would influence the aircraft‚Äôs aerodynamic performance. In addition the modular nature of the DASS simplifies future upgrades and allows each partner nation or export customer the option to tailor the DASS to their individual needs. History The DASS for the Eurofighter Typhoon was intended to be a collaborative effort between the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy. However, integration of the system turned out to be very expensive, so much so that in November 1991, Germany left the programme and initiate its own defense system to equip its Typhoons. In February 1992, before signing the ¬£1.5 billion contract for the DASS, Spain also had doubts about the financial viability and withdrew. This left only the UK and Italy in the consortium, now named EuroDASS (European Defensive Aids Sub-System), to be awarded an initial contract of ¬£200 million ($340 million) with the work shares split 60% to GEC-Marconi (now BAE Systems) and 40% Elettronica. By 1995, Spain had decided to rejoin the EuroDASS consortium and a contract was signed with Elettronica to allow INDRA to participate. In May 1996, Germany had found their national system being developed by DASA was too expensive. In 1997, DASA looked to join the EuroDASS consortium proposing to use the towed radar decoy (TRD) it had developed. These discussions failed as GEC-Marconi had already developed their TRD, known as the Ariel, that had been tested up to mach 2 and was operational with the RAF while the DASA's TRD had only been tested up to mach 1.4 and was not integrated into the Defensive Aids Computer (DAC). Technology The Praetorian system is a modular system consisting of antennas for electronic countermeasures (ECM), electronic support measures (ESM), missile approach warning systems (MAW), laser warning receivers (LWR) and Towed radar decoy (TRD). The system is divided into 20 major line replaceable units (LRU) with all the components controlled by a Teldix GmbH Defensive Aids Computer (DAC) on MIL-STD-1553 databus. The DAC is connected via fiber optic cables to STANAG 3910 in the avionics, with the entire DAC system controlled by five Radstone PowerPC-4 processors, that have a tenfold increase in computing power compared to the original five Motorola 68020 CPUs. It is fully automatic, which greatly relieves the workload for the pilot in combat but the pilot can manually override. ESM-RWR The DASS includes electronic support measures (ESM) and equipped with radar-warning-receivers (RWR). The RWR is designed to detect threat radars using super heterodyne, digital receiver antennas which are located into the wing tip pods giving full 360¬∞ coverage with an accuracy better than 1¬∞ in azimuth. These passive antennas can identify radio frequencies of 100 MHz up to 10 GHz, which is sufficient to detect nearly all types of radar systems and even to detect other RF sources such as radios or datalink systems. The data is compared with the database of radar signatures stored in the Electronic Support Measures suite (ESM). Using this information the ESM allows the identification of the radar and thus the platform it is deployed from and presents it on a moving map or multifunction display producing a 360¬∞ threat picture around the aircraft including identifying targets and even their zones of lethality. This allows the pilot to fly around these zones to avoid detection or being engaged. Thus the system not only warns a pilot but it helps him to look out for potential targets. Laser Warning Receiver (LWR) To counter the threat of laser guided weapons a Laser Warning Receiver, LWR, are installed on UK and Saudi typhoons. These LWRs are optimized for low false alarm rates and can detect lasers pointing at the aircraft and find the direction of the laser source. There are four LWRs on the eurofighter fuselage capable of detecting any incoming laser radiation and determine its bearing, two are located in front of the canards on the front fuselage and the remaining two at the rear behind the wing. ECM ECM wingtip pod The Eurofighter Typhoon features an internal electronic countermeasures system (ECM) that uses a digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) and a digital frequency techniques generator to jam multiple airborne and ground-based radar systems at the same time and at long ranges. Each transmitter and receiver modules (T/R) consists of Vivaldi antennas that can passively locate emitters. The antennas are located in front of the wing tip pods, and another at the rear end of the left pod thus ensuring a 360 ¬∞ coverage. The T/R modules of AESAS are GaAs-MMIC based and operating in the 6‚Äì18 GHz frequency range. The output per module is 27 dBm (0.5 W), before being amplified by 20 dB (100 times), resulting in 50 Watt radiation performance. It is possible that the Cross Eye (X-Eye) system developed by Elettronica will be retrofitted by inserting a second antenna in the right-wing pod. As part of the Phase 1 Enhancement (P1E), Typhoons received new antennas, extending the frequency range and increasing the power and improved DRFM- and ECM techniques. Missile Approach Warner (MAW) The cylindrical pod that pointing backwards, just above the engines, is the missile approach warning receiver To track missiles launched at the typhoon, the DASS incorporates three Missile Approach Warners (MAW), one each in the both wing roots and one in the tail to provide a full 360¬∞ azimuth coverage around the aircraft. In 1991, GEC-Plessey Avionics received the order to develop the missile approach warner derived from their PVS2000 MAW and utilises an active, millimeter-wave Ka-band (32‚Äì38 GHz) pulse-doppler radar for detection. Since the units are active they are able to detect not only radar guided ordnance but also passive weapons such as infra red guided short range missiles. They can detect multiple missiles launched towards the aircraft in all weather conditions and even after the rocket motor‚Äôs burnout phase. Once a missile is detected it will identified according to whether radar or IR guided and its location displayed on the MFDs. The MAW can automatically activate the chaff/flare dispensers as required. Countermeasure Dispenser Systems Chaff and flare dispensers under the wings The Eurofighter includes four chaff/flare launchers mounted under the wings. Two Saab BOL-510 dispensers and two Cobham plc / Elettronica Aster 55mm flare dispensers. These countermeasures are controlled automatically by the DAC and, in response to an immediate threat, by the Missile Approach Warners or manually by the pilot. The two Saab BOL-510 dispensers are located at the end of LAU-7 launch rails near the outer wing tips ensures a good distribution of the decoys in the wake vortices, in addition small air intakes at the end of each dispenser generate more vortices.http://saab.com/globalassets/commercial/air/electronic- warfare/counter-measure-dispenser-systems/bol-advanced-countermeasure- dispenser/bol-pdf/bol-product-sheet.pdf Each dispenser can be loaded with 160 packets of chaff/flares giving the Eurofighter a total of 320 chaff/flare cartridges (total weight 7‚Äì9 kg), consisting of the following decoys: *Chaff RR-184. *Flare MJU-52 / B. The two 55 mm flare dispensers contain 16 decoy rounds each, giving a total capacity of 32 flares per aircraft, and are located into the actuators housing of the inner trailing edge flaperons. The decoys will be automatically deployed in intelligent pre-programmed sequences when a missile is launched. There are two types of ammunition available: *Cartridge Countermeasure 55mm Typhoon IR Decoy. Formerly known as Typhoon IR Decoy No1 Mk1 they were specifically developed for the Typhoon by Chemring Group. Each decoy weighs 0.725 kg and are automatically deployed in intelligent preprogrammed sequences. *BriteCloud Expendable Active Decoy. The DRFM-based active RF countermeasure is up to 375 mm long, 0.7 to 0.85 kg in weight and has a shelf life of about five years. The transmitter produces active emissions for at least 10 seconds. Other Platforms that can be equipped include the Saab Gripen and Panavia Tornado. On 25 July 2018, Saab received an order from BAE Systems for development of the Smart Dispenser System (SDS), a pyrotechnic smart self-protection system for the Royal Air Force‚Äôs (RAF) Typhoons and future Eurofighter opportunities. https://saabgroup.com/media/news-press/news/2018-07/saab-to-provide-rafs- typhoons-with-new-smart-self-protection-system/ \\"This new smart dispenser system provides a significant increase in self-protection capability to defeat modern threats by dispensing optimised countermeasure sequences and directions. SDS will significantly enhance the combat survivability of the Eurofighter Typhoon\\", says Anders Carp, head of Saab business area Surveillance. \\"Saab¬¥s electromechanical self-protection system BOL has been in use on Eurofighter since its inception, and we are now looking forward to strengthening the platform‚Äôs countermeasure capability through SDS.\\" The development and integration work of SDS will be carried out at the Saab site in Sweden and finished around 2020.http://www.defenseworld.net/news/23046/Saab_to_Develop_Self_protection_System_for_Eurofighter_Typhoon#.W1tmMF6lyUk Towed Radar Decoy (TRD) In addition to the onboard ECM, another active countermeasure is the Towed Radar Decoy or TRD. Either one or two Ariel Mk II TRD from Leonardo will be carried in the rear of starboard wingtip pod, and deployed from the pod on a 100 m long Kevlar cable containing a FibreOptic link and a separate power line. The Ariel Mk II is a development of BAE Systems Ariel system which has already been successfully deployed on RAF Tornado's and Nimrod's but is physically smaller to enable carriage in the Typhoon's pods. The TRD can tolerate speeds of up to Mach 2 and loads of + 9 / -3g and will be capable of being recovered or jettisoned as the situation requires. The TRDs are effective against a variety of different radar systems like monopulse, TWS or CLOS (Command Line Of Sight) radars. As the TRD is an offboard jammer, radar systems featuring a home on jam mode (HOJ) will not be able to directly lock on to the aircraft itself. The effectiveness is further enhanced by the release of Chaff clouds making the decoy a more attractive target for the missile.

The SRK method were motivated as a numerical method for the time integration of the incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations with two salient properties. First, velocity and pressure computations are segregated. Second, the method keeps the same order of accuracy for both velocities and pressures. However, the SRK method can also be applied to any other DAE of index 2.  The Segregated Runge‚ÄìKutta method  Consider an index 2 DAE defined as follows: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\dot{y}(t)&=f(y(t),z(t)),\\\\ 0&=g(y(t)). \\\\end{align} :where y(t)\\\\in\\\\R^n, z(t)\\\\in\\\\R^m, f:\\\\R^{n+m}\\\\to\\\\R^n and g:\\\\R^{n}\\\\to\\\\R^m. In the previous equations y is known as the differential variable, while z is known as the algebraic variable. The time derivative of the differential variable, \\\\dot{y}, depends on itself, y, on the algebraic variable, z, and on the time, t. The second equation can be seen as a constraint on differential variable, y. Let us take the time derivative of the second equation. Assuming that the function g is linear and does not depend on time, and that the function f is linear with respect to z, we have that :0=\\\\dot{g}(y)=g(\\\\dot{y})=g(f(y,z))=g(f(y)+f(z))=g(f(y))+g(f(z))). A Runge‚ÄìKutta time integration scheme is defined as a multistage integration in which each stage is computed as a combination of the unknowns evaluated in other stages. Depending on the definition of the parameters, this combination can lead to an implicit scheme or an explicit scheme. Implicit and explicit schemes can be combined, leading to IMEX schemes.

As an illustrator, he contributed cartoons and human interest articles illustrated with his drawings to several magazines and newspapers. Under the name E.G. Lutz, he authored 17 books. Most were how-to manuals dealing with art and drawing techniques, but two were about aspects of the film industry, which was rapidly developing in the early years of the 20th century. One of his most popular books was Drawing Made Easy (1921), which was written for young artists. Perhaps his most influential work was Animated Cartoons (1920), the first book to describe what were then state-of-the-art animation techniques. A 19-year-old Walt Disney discovered the book at his local library and used it as a guide during his first years in his animation career. Life and career=Early life Lutz was born August 26, 1868, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to German immigrants John Martin Lutz (c. 1842‚Äì1878) and Anna Ernestine Bachman Lutz (1845 - 1879). He was the oldest of four children. His siblings were William Florence Lutz (1871‚Äì1945), Flora Johanna Lutz Wiegandt (1873‚Äì1959) and Ernest Martin Lutz (1877‚Äì1928). His parents died of tuberculosis within a year of each other, and the siblings were split up and raised by different families in 1879. Edwin and his brother William were raised on a farm in Palmyra, NJ, while Flora and Ernest grew up in the homes of aunts and uncles in the Philadelphia area. At the age of 11, Lutz was enrolled in the boarding school Nazareth Hall, a \\"classical academy\\" where music, drawing, painting, French, Latin, and Greek were taught. When he was 17, he became a student at the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art in Philadelphia, PA. The curriculum focused on drawing and sculpture. In this school, he studied under Thomas Eakins, a realist painter that has prominence as an important artist in American art history. Marriage Lutz married Eleanor Ludlam Dangler (born in 1873) in Philadelphia on June 8, 1892. Eleanor was a milliner and the owner of the Mme Eleanor Hat Co. (or Mme Eleanor Millinery) in New York, NY. Based on census records, the couple were divorced sometime between 1920 and 1930. The couple did not have children. E.G. Lutz at Work, c 1918 Artist career As a cartoonist and illustrator, Lutz met with early success and his work appeared in many newspapers and magazines, including: The Monthly Illustrator, Joseph Pulitzer's newspaper - The World, Life, Country Life, The Cosmopolitan, Century Magazine, St. Nicholas magazine, The Sun, New York Tribune, Satire (a Pulitzer periodical), The Seattle Intelligencer's Book of Magic and The Washington Times. Many of his illustrations and cartoons included anthropomorphized animals, food, and early optical toys. In 1900, at the age of 32, Lutz attended the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris, France, a private school for painting and sculpture. Publishing career Lutz published 17 books from the 1913 through 1936, under the name E.G. Lutz. His first work, What to Draw and How to Draw It, was published in 1913 by Dodd, Mead & Company. The book, which was created for the beginning drawer, consists of sequenced illustrations that provide step-by-step instructions on how to sketch figures. This book and Drawing Made Easy, published by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1921, grew out of work Lutz created for a series of newspaper articles published in The Sun in 1912. Drawing Made Easy was Lutz's most popular book and was reprinted through the 1970s. In it, Lutz taught a method of drawing based on the technique used in French art schools in the 19th century: begin with large basic forms and progressively refine them by adding smaller shapes and detail. Book cover of Animated Cartoons At the age of 52, Lutz wrote his most influential book, Animated Cartoons - How they are made, their origin and development, (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1920). The book offered practical ideas for streamlining the production of animated drawings. While a few articles and books on animation mentioned studio practices before Animated Cartoons, this was the first book dedicated to the subject. The book affected an entire industry in the formative years of animation studios. At the age of 19, Walt Disney borrowed Animated Cartoons from the Kansas City Library shortly after the book was published in 1920. It is well documented that Animated Cartoons greatly influenced him in his early years in animation. The book was one of the primary animation guides used by Disney's Laugh-O-Grams studio team in Kansas City, Missouri, throughout the 1920s. Referring to Animated Cartoons, Disney himself has stated that \\"Finding that book was one of the most important and useful events in my life.\\" Bibliography * What to Draw and How to Draw It ‚Äì The Ideal Method (1913) Dodd, Mead & Company * Practical Drawing ‚Äì A book for the student and the general reader (1915) Charles Scribner's Sons * Practical Art Anatomy ‚Äì Structural anatomy of the human figure easily understood by ingeniously drawn diagrams (1918) Charles Scribner's Sons * Animated Cartoons ‚Äì How they are made, their origin and development (1920) Charles Scribner's Sons * Drawing Made Easy ‚Äì A helpful book for young artists (1921) Charles Scribner's Sons * Instead of Scribbling ‚Äì A guide to pencil drawing, a drawing book for young people (1924) Dodd, Mead & Company * Practical Graphic Figures ‚Äì The technical side of drawing for cartoons and fashions (1925) Charles Scribner's Sons * Practical Pictorial Composition ‚Äì A guide to the appreciation of pictures.

Gain in a semiconductor laser Using the density matrix equations with relaxation, the following derivations have been made: Einstein‚Äôs spectral coefficient in a semiconductor laser and, accordingly, Einstein‚Äôs coefficient;Noppe M. G. The Resonance and Nonresonance Coefficients of Stimulated Transitions for a System with Relaxation, Technical Physics Letters 2000, V. 26, 10-11 formula for the saturation effect in a semiconductor laser was derived; it was shown that the saturation effect in a semiconductor laser is small. Gain in a semiconductor laser has been derived using the density matrix equations with relaxation. It has been found that Fabry-Perot laser gain depends on energy flux, and this determines the ‚Äòbasic nonlinear effect‚Äô in a semiconductor laser (14)\\\\quad g=g(I)=R\\\\Delta \\\\omega_e/(1-I(\\\\delta \\\\Delta\\\\omega_e/\\\\delta I)/\\\\Delta\\\\omega_e), where (15)\\\\quad R=(\\\\hbar\\\\omega n_g/c)B_{21}(f_2-f_1)S_P(\\\\omega). where B_{21} is Einstein coefficient for induced transition between the two energy levels when exposed to a narrow-band wave is written in the following form: (16)\\\\quad B_{21}=(\\\\hat{H}_{21}/\\\\hbar)^2/(2\\\\Gamma_0) where \\\\Delta \\\\omega_e is effective natural linewidth; I is the energy flux; S_P(\\\\omega) is spectral density of transitions. Necessary condition for induced radiation of the 1st kind Necessary conditions for induced radiation of the 1st and 2nd kind have been defined in. Necessary conditions for induced radiation are determined by the requirement for the gain to be greater than zero. Necessary condition for induced radiation of the 1st kind formulated by Bernard and DuraffourgAndreev, A.Yu., et al. Semiconductors, 2009,43 543-547 is that the population of levels located above becomes more than the population of levels located below (17)\\\\quad f_2(E_2)>f_1(E_1). Necessary condition for induced radiation of the 2nd kind The necessary condition of induced radiation of the 2nd kind formulated by Noppe is that: (18)\\\\quad \\\\Delta \\\\omega_e/(1-I(\\\\delta \\\\Delta \\\\omega_e/\\\\delta I)/\\\\Delta \\\\omega_e)>0. Figure.1. Functions g_1(I) and g_2(I) versus energy flux I for two sets of characteristic parameters. The necessary condition of induced radiation of the 2nd kind allows formulating the basic restriction of laser capacity, which has been confirmed experimentally: (19)\\\\quad I where I is energy flux; I(M) is the characteristic parameter of ultimate power. Figure 1 shows the function g(I) for two sets of characteristic parameters. Simulation of experiments 4.1. Maxwell's equations in the gain medium are used to obtain equations for energy flux. Nonlinear phase effect has been described and simulated, using the nonlinearity of refractive index. (see Fig.3). 4.2. Based on the developed theory, experimental output characteristics have been simulated: natural linewidth (see simulation in,) (see Fig.2), experimental watt - ampere characteristics (see Fig.4) and dependence of experimental output radiation line-length on the current in Fabry-Perot semiconductor injection lasers, (see Fig.3), as well as linewidth in DFB lasers (see simulation in,).

Experimental and theoretical output power versus current for a powerful laser. Conclusion Based on the solution of the density matrix equations, Einstein coefficient for induced transition has been derived; it has been shown that the saturation effect is small for semiconductor lasers. The formula of gain depending on the energy flux has been derived; it is the basic nonlinear effect in a laser. It has been stated that the main effect resulting in nonlinearity is the saturation effect. For semiconductor lasers, the saturation effect is negligible. We derived the gain g for a Fabry-Perot semiconductor laser based on the density matrix equations and expressions for the natural linewidth. Thus, the linewidth theory is an integral part of the nonlinear theory. The resulting dependence of g on the energy flux has been called the main nonlinear effect in semiconductor lasers; derivation of this relation formula is presented in. Experimental wavelength shift versus normalized current (J/Jth), and the output power versus current have been simulated for a high-power laser with a quantum well of intrinsic semiconductor. Broadening of the states density due to different effects has been taken into consideration. The nonlinear theory made it possible to explain a number of experiments some of which could not even be explained (for example, natural linewidth), much less modeled, on the basis of other theoretical models; this suggests that the nonlinear theory developed is a new paradigm of the laser theory. Due to the nonlinear theory development, recommendations can be given for creating lasers with smaller natural linewidth, and lasers with higher output power.

One of the densest concentration of forts is Tongwei County, which has the nickname \\"thousand forts county\\" (). Qin'an County is home to three larger castles. Although each fort may not be impressive on its own, the combined defence line of forts has been compared to the Great Wall of China. Usage Although some of the forts date back to the Qin dynasty, they have been used as late as the Sino-Japanese war. During the Dungan Revolt, villagers sought refuge from the raiding and fighting in these forts, and new forts were even constructed with the same methods. As of now, most of the forts lie abandoned, partly due to the difficulty of reaching the hilltops. The courtyards of some forts have filled by farmhouses or Taoist temples. The defenders inside the forts varied, with some larger forts being permanently manned by trained military, smaller ones were just refuge places for villagers from nearby.

She wrote eleven bookshttp://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=LitRC&u;=gree35277&v;=2.1‚Å¢=r&id;=GALE%7CH1200008279&inPS;=true as well as numerous articles and stories that were translated and published in many languages, and probably many more works that appeared anonymously. Phelps wrote \\"at the beginning of the transition in American women's writing from domestic sentimentality to regional realism\\" and was \\"among the earliest depicters of the New England scene, antedating the regional novels of her Andover neighbor, Harriet Beecher Stowe\\". In addition to being one of the earliest known authors to have penned a fiction series specifically for girls, her writing also focused on the burdens on women in their restrictive roles as mothers and wives. Her much anthologized 1852 semi-autobiographical short story, \\"The Angel Over the Right Shoulder\\", illustrates the repressive burdens frustrating a wife's creative ambitions and need to \\"cultivate her own mind and heart\\". The story is notable as \\"one of the rare woman's fictions of this time to recognize the phenomenon of domestic schizophrenia\\", says literary critic Nina Baym. Her only daughter and eldest child, the writer Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward, noted that her creative and talented mother was \\"torn\\" by an internal \\"civil war\\" between a woman's calling as caretaker of others and as a creative artist and thinker in her own right. \\"The struggle killed her\\", reflected Ward, \\"but she fought till she fell.\\" Early life Phelps was born in Andover, Massachusetts on August 13, 1815, to Moses Stuart and Abigail (Clark) Stuart. Her father was a prominent professor of Sacred Literature at Andover Theological Seminary where he is credited with pioneering modern biblical study in America. He was an anti-abolitionist Christian and he wrote an influential scriptural justification for slavery and for the deportation of black people to Africa in the 1850 pamphlet \\"Conscience and the Constitution\\". On her mother's side, the family tree led back to John Winthrop, the English Puritan lawyer and Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. She was also childhood friends with author Harriette Newell Woods Baker, also born in Andover, with whom she started a writing society to read each other's work. In 1829, at the age of 14, Phelps was among the first class of students to attend the newly opened Abbot Academy, one of the nation's first residential high schools for girls. In 1832, she subsequently enrolled in Boston's Mount Vernon School under the tutelage of its principal Reverend Jacob Abbott, a prolific writer and editor whose works include the popular Rollo books and Lucy books for children. Phelps lived in the Abbott household for two years and while there published her first writings under the pseudonym H. Trusta (an anagram of Stuart) in Abbott's periodical, The Religious Magazine. After completing her education, Phelps returned to Andover in 1834 suffering from chronic health problems including partial blindness, headaches, and even temporary paralysis. She was diagnosed with a \\"cerebral disease\\" or \\"brain fever\\" that plagued her for the remainder of her life, possibly a result of that battle she struggled with to comply with what her daughter later termed \\"the relentless drudgery of domestic toil\\" while yearning to express her full intellectual and creative mind. Adult life She returned to Boston and married Austin Phelps in 1842. Now a prominent minister's wife at the Pine Street Church in Boston, Phelps gave birth to her first child, a daughter baptized Mary Gray (who would adopt her deceased mother's name and become a famous writer in her own right), and lived for six reportedly happy years. In 1848, her husband accepted a position at Andover Theological Seminary alongside his father-in-law, Moses Stuart. In 1849, Phelps began writing the Kitty Brown books, a four-volume religious series, penning one volume per year. After Phelps' death just four years later, Reverend Phelps acknowledged his wife's \\"foreboding\\" regarding Andover's oppressiveness for women (\\"Memorial\\", p. 74). In those four years, Phelps gave birth to two more children, Moses and Amos, and became a bestselling author with the 1851 publication of The Sunny Side; or, The Country Minister's Wife. The novel sold 100,000 copies in its first year, eventually more than 500,000, and garnered international recognition. Elizabeth Wooster Stuart Phelps died in Andover on November 30, 1852. Phelps is buried in Phillips Academy Cemetery of Andover, Massachusetts. Bibliography * Little Kitty Brown and Her Bible Verses. (1851) * Kitty Brown and Her City Cousins.

Andrey spent his childhood and school years in the north of Russia, in the village Purpe of Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District. At school Andrey stood out for his love for the sport. In the mornings before the lessons started he regularly used to jog, he also did various sports, and represented his school in different sport events and competitions. Before bodybuilding became his passion, Andrey had already had several senior degrees in such sports as athletics, gymnastics, and basketball. In 2006, Andrey Skoromnyy graduated from high school and moved to Moscow to study. At the age of 17, Andrey began attending the nearby weightlifting club and became extremely interested in bodybuilding. His initial weight was about 65 kg when he started weight training. Yoshkar-Ola Championship held in the spring of 2010 became the first bodybuilding competition for Andrey. On it the debutant participated in the junior category and in the final standing confidently took the first place. After that Andrey was asked to compete for bodyweight category for men \\"up to 90kg\\". As a result, he won a bronze medal. At all- Russian tournament on bodybuilding held the same spring, Andrey won in the category \\"juniors over 75 kg\\" category and got the first place in absolute junior standing. In the make \\"up to 90 kg\\" category Andrey trailed only to Sergei Kopantsev and Vadim Solonchak, who took first and second places respectively. In autumn 2010, in the championship of Moscow region he got again the first place in absolute standing among the juniors, and again the third place in the category for men, but \\"up to 100 kg\\"category. He had the same result in the Moscow city championship (the first place in absolute standing among the juniors). And this time due to leaner muscles Andrey took second place in the \\"up to 90 kg\\" category by turning aside a bronze medalist Ivan Kochetkov. He trailed only to Ivan Vodianov. Andrey Skoromnyy completed autumn contest participating in all-Russian tournament, where he won his category of \\"juniors over 75 kg\\" as well as the absolute standings, and became the champion of Russia. Unfortunately, he couldn't compete in the World Championship. A simple cold led to a complicated ear disease. Therefore, 17 days before the announced date Andrey was taken to hospital and was forced to stop precompetitive preparation. Having missed the spring competitive season, in October 2011 at the Open Championship and Cup of Moscow, after leaving the junior division Andrey Skoromnyy got first place in the category for \\"men up to 100 kg\\". In absolute standings he was second after a heavy-weight champion Vitaliy Fateev, having beaten the winners of other weight categories: Sergey Doronichev (up to 85 kg), Pavel Ivanov (up to 90 kg), and Pavel Goncharov (up to 80 kg). He graduated from Moscow State Automobile and Road University, Faculty of Road Transport. While studying at the university, he worked as a personal trainer in the fitness centre. On his trainings Andrey Skoromnyy follows his intuition. And in the off-season and before contests he does high- volume workouts, he works with each muscle group once every 7 days. He usually trains either three days on/one day off or two days on/one day off. He doesn‚Äôt train the abdominal and calf muscles in the off-season. He does a 20-minute cardiovascular exercise after strength training. While \\"cutting\\" he is on the carbohydrate-free diet and compensates the lack of calories with plenty of protein. Andrey trains in Lyubertsy. In the beginning of a pretty successful competitive career Andrey trained individually. But later he confessed that due to a lack of knowledge of competitive training and he asked for help from Aleksey V. Kireev (\\"Dr. Luber\\"). The first results of their fruitful cooperation became the nearest achievements of 2010 autumn season.Andrey Skoromnyy.

It draws from the syntax of comics, images, panels, speech balloons, and so on, in order to produce a literary or artistic experience akin to that of traditional poetry.  History  Comics poetry traces its origins to illuminated manuscripts, graphic novels, concrete poetry, and poets who combined images and text such as Kenneth Patchen. In the mid-2000s, a number of artist-poets began publishing independently of one another, referring to what they were doing expressly as comics poetry. According to artist and scholar Tamryn Bennett, \\"The term comics poetry can be applied to a growing field of works that fall outside of traditional definitions of both comics and poetry. These works include Warren Craghead‚Äôs How To Be Everywhere (2007); Matt Madden's Comic Sestina (2004), Michael Farrell's BREAK ME OUCH (2006); as well as a host of comics poetry collections by Bianca Stone, Alexander Rothman, Paul K. Tunis, Gary Sullivan, John Hankiewicz, Anders Nilsen, Derik Badman, Eroyn Franklin, Franklin Einspruch, Sommer Browning, Kimball Anderson, Mohit Trendster, Kevin Czapiewski, Malcy Duff and Julie Delporte, among others.\\"  Terminology  Use of the terms \\"comics poetry\\" and \\"poetry comics\\" is widespread among its practitioners. Alexander Rothman, editor-in- chief of Ink Brick, has written, \\"I call the work that I make and publish 'comics poetry.' ...at the end of the day, more than any other practitioner, a poet is just dealing with words.... Words aren‚Äôt necessary for comics, but of course they‚Äôre there to use. Panels aren‚Äôt necessary, but they‚Äôre also there to use. Where the poet‚Äôs toolbox contains every imaginable arrangement or manipulation of words, the cartoonist‚Äôs holds analogs for the visual elements of the page.\\" Chrissy Williams, editor of Over the Line: An Introduction to Poetry Comics, said in an interview, \\"I generally say 'poetry comic' by the way, not to give any priority to the poetry, but rather to avoid any confusion with 'comic poems,' which are already their own very different hilarious genre of poem. ... the genre needs to be defined fundamentally as an inextricable combination of both comics and poetry, neither of which should be dispensable. In the best poetry comics, I believe, the piece would fail utterly (or at best be horrifically diminished) if you removed either the poetry or the artwork from the composition.\\" Tamryn Bennet has written, \\"Like [comics poet] Derik Badman, I use the term 'comics poetry', as opposed to 'graphic poetry', 'comics-as-poetry', or 'poetry comics', as it refers to the origins of the form rather than the sequential narratives of graphic novels. As Badman explains, 'Comics poetry isn't poetry as text with comics images; it's the whole comic as poetry. The images, the words, the structure, the rhythm, the page, all of it is used together to create the poetry, to create comics in a poetic register.'\\" \\"Comics poetry\\" can be used to differentiate the genre from written poems later interpreted in comics form, such as the work of Dave Morice, which is also called \\"poetry comics.\\"  Comics poetry publications  * Comics as Poetry.

White has only their king on the board with no other pieces (like the Naked King Ë£∏Áéâ handicap) and three pawns held in hand. Black has the usual setup of twenty pieces.  Opening  1...P*86. As with all traditional handicap games, White has the first move. The standard first move is to drop a dangling pawn (ÂûÇ„ÇåÊ≠©) on the eighth file attacking the head of Black's bishop (ËßíÈ†≠ kaku t≈ç). White is threatening to promote this pawn to a tokin („Å®) on their next move. The test here is to see if Black can respond adequately to this threat. There are three ways to respond to avoid the loss of the bishop. Silver response ‚òó 2. S-78 2\\\\. S-78. Moving the silver up to rank 8 defends the 87 square rendering White's pawn attack futile. 2...Px87+, 3. Sx87. Although White can promote their pawn and capture Black's pawn (obtaining 3 pawns in hand again), Black can simply capture the promoted pawn. Furthermore, Black's advanced silver can always retreat back to the 78 square if White threatens with another pawn drop (3...P*86, 4. S-78). If White does drop another pawn and Black captures it (3...P*86, 4. Sx86), then Black's silver offers no protection for the bishop from White's subsequent pawn drop. However, now the 79 square is free for the bishop to retreat to. White's pawn on 87 is not a threat. If Black plays from here on without major errors, they should become the victor. Gold response ‚òó 2. G-78 2\\\\. G-78. Moving the gold to defend the bishop's head is a standard move in many Double Static Rook openings, such as Bishop Exchange, Double Wing Attack, or Side Pawn Capture. In the Three Pawns handicap, using the gold is slightly more complicated than using the silver (shown above). 2...Px87+, 3. Gx87. White's pawn promotes, and Black's gold recaptures. 3...P*86. White can then strike with another dangling pawn. 4\\\\. Gx86. Unlike the case with the silver defense, a gold cannot retreat and must move forward and capture the pawn. 4...P*85. White will try another a drop with a striking pawn (Âè©„Åç„ÅÆÊ≠©). The hope is White can lure Black's gold forward. 5\\\\. G-86. The correct response to the striking pawn is for the gold to retreat. After this, White's attack on the eighth file is exhausted. If instead Black captures the striking pawn (5. Gx85?), the gold will be positioned on the 85 square and no longer able to defend the bishop's head, the 87 square, where White can drop their last pawn (5...P*87!) and capture Black's bishop on their next move (6...Px88+!). Similar comments apply to the gold moving sideways to either the left (5. G-96?) or right (5. G-76?). Bishop diagonal ‚òó 2. P-76 2\\\\. P-76. Another possible but suboptimal move is to create an escape hatch for Black's bishop. 2...Px87+, 3. B-33+. Although White can promote their pawn, Black's bishop can escape to 33 and promote as well checking White's king. After White resolves Black's check, White has a further chance to exchange pawns for more powerful pieces. For example, White can sacrifice a pawn (4...P*98, 5. Lx98) and then drop another pawn (5...P*88) in order to attack both Black's lance and knight allowing White to trade a pawn for a lance and possibly the other pawn for another piece. Thus, although Black has saved one their most powerful pieces, opening up the bishop diagonal gives White more of an advantage compared with protecting the bishop's head with a silver or gold. Furthermore, the bishop's diagonal can always be opened after proper defense of the bishop's head. Blunder ‚òó 2. Px86 2\\\\. Px86? Black reflexively capturing White's pawn on 86 is a blunder. Although this captures White's pawn, it does not remove the threat to Black's bishop as the bishop's head is still vulnerable. 2...P*87! White can now drop a pawn directly on the bishop's head. At this point, Black has no way to prevent White from capturing their bishop and dramatically improving White's chances. This pawn drop on the bishop's head is a tactic that can be applied to real even game openings such as the Double Wing Attack opening if either Black or White does not appropriately defend their bishops' heads.

Background  left The Free City of Danzig (; ) was a semi-autonomous city-state that existed between 1920 and 1939, consisting of the Baltic Sea port of Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk, Poland) and nearly 200 towns in the surrounding areas. It was created on 15 November 1920 in accordance with the 1919 Treaty of Versailles after the end of World War I and was under League of Nations protection. The Free City was primarily inhabited by ethnic Germans but the majority fled or were expelled when the territory was incorporated into Poland at the conclusion of World War II.  History  On 13 November 1947, W. Richter, the chairman of the Association of Nationals of Danzig Free State, announced the formation of a government-in- exile for the Free City of Danzig. The government made pleas to the United Nations, calling for official recognition, the deportation of Poles from its claimed territory, and assistance in reestablishing the Free City. Richter also announced that the association would accept a settlement from the international community that would grant them an alternative territory in a center of commerce. The legislative body of the government in exile, the Rat der Danziger (Council of Danzig), was established that year. In 1951 and 1961, it was supposedly recognized in secret by Danzig expatriates as the \\"legal successor of the Senate of the Free City of Danzig.\\"  Government  The Free State of Danzig government is based in Berlin, Germany. It respects the original Constitution of the Free City of Danzig. The official government website is run by the incumbent Head of Foreign Affairs, Senator Ernst F. Kriesner. The government's legislature takes the form of a parliament, the Rat der Danziger (Council of Danzig), which has 36 members and claims to represent the interests of German Danzigers. Members of the council are elected by Danzig expatriates and their descendants by a mailed-in ballot.  Recognition and relations  A formal letter was sent to the United Nations in 1998 by Senator Kriesner requesting official recognition. Writing on the lack of official German recognition of the Free City of Danzig Government in Exile, Polish Foreign Minister W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski stated that the organization and like-minded Danzig cultural associations were seen in the eyes of the German public as revanchist and politically aligned with the far- right National Democratic Party of Germany.  Claims  The government lays claims to the entire territory once possessed by the Free City of Danzig. It bases the legitimacy of its assertion upon the notion that the Free City of Danzig was a neutral state and that its annexation by Germany in 1939 was illegal; as such, the Allies had no authority in incorporating the city into Poland after World War II. In addition to this, no formal treaty has ever altered the status of the Free City of Danzig, and its incorporation into Poland has rested upon the general acquiescence of the international community.

Personal life Jones was born in the British Army Camp in Munster, West Germany. Jones married fellow Strictly Come Dancing professional dancer Katya Jones (nee Sokolova) in August 2013. During the 2018 series, media interest in Katya's relationship with her series partner Seann Walsh led to both publicly apologising for their conduct. After six years of marriage, on 18 August 2019, Neil and Katya announced their separation. The Walsh incident was partly blamed for the split, but the couple insisted they would remain friends and would both continue to appear on Strictly. He confirmed in August 2020 that he was in a new relationship, his partner was later revealed to be Colombian dancer Luisa Eusse.

More precisely, it states a condition for [\\\\mathbf{I} - \\\\mathbf{A}] under which the input‚Äìoutput system :[\\\\mathbf{I} - \\\\mathbf{A}] \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{d} has a solution \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{x}} \\\\geq 0 for any \\\\mathbf{d} \\\\geq 0. Here \\\\mathbf{I} is the identity matrix and \\\\mathbf{A} is called the input‚Äìoutput matrix or Leontief matrix after Wassily Leontief, who empirically estimated it in the 1940s. Together, they describe a system in which :\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij} x_{j} + d_{i} = x_{i} \\\\quad i = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, n where a_{ij} is the amount of the ith good used to produce one unit of the jth good, x_{j} is the amount of the jth good produced, and d_{i} is the amount of final demand for good i. Rearranged and written in vector notation, this gives the first equation.

Language The Yanyuwa language has been classified as one of the Ngarna languages of the larger Pama‚ÄìNyungan language family. Many Yanyuwa have also been bilingual in the Garrwa language. The retention of their language as with Garrwa has been attributed to the relative disinterest of colonizing whites in the lands both of these tribes traditionally inhabited. Taking as his starting point an observation by Edward Sapir concerning the Yahi dialect of Yana, who considered the gendered distinction in language use between Yanna men and women as very rare, or not as pervasive as in this dialect, John Bradley showed that in Yanyuwa, the differentiation was at least as structurally thorough as in Yahi. The gendered linguistic difference between liyi-wulu-wu (speech for men) and liyi nhanawaya-wu (speech for women) affected noun classes, verbs and pronouns, and in their creation stories, this distinction was maintained by male and female spirits. Raised predominantly by the women, boys spoke the women's dialect until initiation, whereupon they were obliged by custom not to speak as if they had breasts and vaginas. Neighbouring tribes, speakers of Marra, Garrwa and Gurdanji consider Yanyuwa difficult precisely for this gendered difference in grammar, whereas the Yanyuwa, conversely, have no difficulty in mastering the latter languages. Two exceptions exist, in ribald talk, and in certain songline cycles where male figures use female speech, though the reason is not known. Bradley's conclusion is: > The reasons as to why two distinct dialects for female and male speakers > developed are lost in time., This feature has however served to make Yanyuwa > a language unique within Aboriginal Australia, if not the world. Country In Norman Tindale's estimation, the Yanyuwa had roughly of tribal lands, encompassing the McArthur River from near Borroloola as far as the coast, and running southeast along the coast to the other sided of Tully Inlet. They were also present at Pungalina. Offshore, perhaps excluding Vanderlin Island though contemporary Yanyuwa insist they were indigenous also to that area, they also lived and fished on the Sir Edward Pellew Islands. The Yanyuwa lived east of the Wilingura. On their southern flank were the Binbinga people. In the Yanyuwa language there are some 1,500 placenames marking out the distinctive features of the territory they once inhabited. Social structure Yanyuwa law divides generations in the following sequence: the li- ambirrijingu (those in front) are the ancestors, fully-fledged in the intricacies of being Yanyuwa. The li-wumbijingu (those in the middle) are constituted by the present generation of elders. Thirdly, there are the li- ngulakaringu (those behind), the young, including those yet to be born. History The Yanyuwa traded with the trepangers from the port of Makassar in Sulawesi who had begun to explore the area of the Gulf of Carpentaria since the 1720s. The trade cycle was based on sailing south with the north westerlies that began to blow in December and then returning under the south easterlies blowing up from April. Trade relations with the Sulawesi were excellent. Yanyuwa people are known to have sailed back on the Sulawesi fleet of praus to stay over for months at Makasser. They like many other Gulf peoples adopted Makaser as a lingua franca, whose vocabulary left traces in many of the aboriginal gulf languages.

Houston was born in Panola, Sumter County, Alabama in the Black Belt. The ninth of eleven children, he grew up in the farmhouse built by his father, a farmer, barber, carpenter, and bricklayer. He began playing guitar by age six. In 1962 he moved to Chicago where three of his brothers had already relocated and formed a band (Sweetman and the Sugar Boys), which he joined. The band broke up following the death of his brother Nathanial, and Houston ‚Äì briefly taking the stage name Dog Man ‚Äì worked various gigs as he honed his craft in the 1960s and 1970s.

His stage name is based on fictional pulp noir hero Boston Blackie; Houston was also exceptionally dark-skinned, given to playfully challenging the audience to send up a blacker person, a game he never lost. Houston developed an aggressive, raw, and hard-edged style, informed by the work of Magic Sam, Otis Rush, Elmore James, Little Milton, and Bobby Blue Bland. He performed at all the West Side delta blues clubs. At the time of his death his Boston Blackie Blues Band was regularly appearing at Mr. Tee's Lounge, the Delta Fish Market, and the Guess Who Lounge.

Biography Fraz√£o was born in June 1988 in Luanda, the capital of Angola. While her parents are Angolan, some of her family comes from Portugal and Cape Verde. She has been interested in music since childhood and first began writing songs at the age of 15. Her biggest influence is Paulo Flores. At the age of 18, she moved to Portugal to attend the New University of Lisbon, where she received a degree in communication. After graduation, she worked as a journalist for the newspaper Rede Angola. She became involved in social movements after moving to Spain and was introduced to flamenco. Her first time in the recording studio was a collaboration with the flautist C√©sar Herranz entitled \\"A Minha Embala\\". In 2011, after moving to Santiago de Compostela, she released her debut solo album, \\"Clave Bantu\\". It has a jazz idiom and features some lyrics written by with Angolan writers Jos√© Eduardo Agualusa and Ondjaki. Her second album, \\"Movimento\\", was a partnership between her and the Angolan poet Carlos Ferreira and includes a poem by Alda Lara set to music. It came out in 2013. Fraz√£o released her third album of original material, \\"Insular\\", in 2015. It was recorded on the small Scottish island of Jura, chosen for its isolated location, in the studio of the album's producer Giles Perring. Also on this album several musicians provided accompaniment, among others, the Portuguese guitarist Pedro Geraldes and, at the recommendation of Perring, who also played all the percussion, bass player Simon Edwards, clarinettist Sarah Homer, and Scottish harpist Esther Swift of Twelfth Day. It features some lyrics by the Angolan poet Ana Paula Tavares and the Portuguese rapper Capicua. All the songs were new, except the traditional \\"Susana\\", which was recorded in Lisbon and is very well known in Angola. Fraz√£o has toured in countries such as Cape Verde, Kenya, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Germany, Brazil, Portugal, Switzerland, Norway and Austria. She currently resides in Lisbon.

Early years  She was born Millicent Maxine Edwards in Jackson Heights, Queens, New York. After moving to Florida, she graduated from Miami Edison High School.  Career  When she was 12 years old, Edwards danced in Let's Face It, and at the age of 14, she appeared on Broadway as a dancer in Zigfeld Follies of 1943. Her other Broadway credits include Laffing Room Only (1944) and The Duchess Misbehaves (1946). Edwards' film debut came in My Wild Irish Rose (1947). She also appeared in the films Trail of Robin Hood, Spoilers of the Plains, Heart of the Rockies, In Old Amarillo, North of the Great Divide, Sunset in the West, Street Bandits, and Missing Women, among others. In the late 1940s, Edwards toured the United States for 14 months, performing in vaudeville. Public response to Edwards' appearance with Roy Rogers in Sunset in the West (1950) led to her receiving a long-term contract with Republic Pictures. In the 1950s, Edwards appeared on television in Westerns and mystery programs. Edwards appeared as Nan Gable in the 1958 episode, \\"Two-Gun Nan\\", on the syndicated television anthology series, Death Valley Days. In the story line, Nan is a woman sharpshooter affiliated with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. She sets out on a daring, 180-day Thoroughbred horse ride from San Francisco to New York City to prove that a woman could complete such a task. Robert \\"Buzz\\" Henry (1931‚Äì1971) played her husband, Frank Gable, and William O'Neal (1898‚Äì1961) was cast as Cody. Still living in 1958, Nan Gable appeared with series host Stanley Andrews at the conclusion of the episode. In 1954, Edwards announced her retirement from acting \\"to do the Lord's work in whatever way He wills.\\" In 1956, though, she appeared as Molly Crowley in the TV Western series Cheyenne in the episode titled \\"Johnny Bravo\\".  Personal life  Edwards was divorced from Ralph H. Winters and Jerry Friedman.  Death  Edwards died of lung cancer on August 26, 1998, in Friendswood, Texas, at the age of 70.

(2005). Creating Compact and Complete Communities: Seven Propositions for Success. Practicing Planner, AICP. While the concept is used by many communities as part of their community plan, each plan interprets what complete community means in their own way. The idea of the complete community has roots in early planning theory, beginning with The Garden City Movement, and is a component of contemporary planning methods including Smart Growth.  History  The Garden City Movement was one of the first proponents for creating communities that accommodate a wide range of community members through a mix in housing types and uses. Increasing urban sprawl, and its associated negative social, environmental, and health effects, prompted a turn in theory towards increasing density in urban areas. This idea has been brought into contemporary theoretical movements including Smart Growth, New Urbanism, and Sustainable Development, which all advocate high-density 'compact' communities, and also increase the mix of activities and land uses that contribute to a complete community. The move toward compact and complete communities in modern planning is summarized in the first two Ahwahnee Principles, a landmark document created by the California Local Government Commission that provided the foundation for Smart Growth and New Urbanism: (1) \\"all planning should be in the form of complete and integrated communities including housing, shops, workplaces, schools, parks and civic facilities essential to the daily life of the residents\\" and (2) \\"community size should be designed so that housing, jobs, daily needs, and other activities are within easy walking distance of each other.\\"Calthorpe, P., Corbett, M., Duany, A., Moule, E., Plater-Zyberk, E., & Polyzoides, S. (1991). The Ahwahnee Principles. Local Government Commission. Since the 1970s, Canadian planning policy has aimed to make communities more attractive and efficient through compact form, mixed-use, higher densities and a range of housing types. Households in North America are becoming smaller, have a different form than previous generations and are more socially and economically diverse; while housing costs have increased dramatically in some parts of the country, resulting in smaller lot sizes and an increase in multi-family housing options and suburban density. One of the typical critiques of past suburban growth patterns is that they replicate trends of a homogeneous landscape consisting mainly of white, middle class, nuclear families. Social diversity and affordability looked to be addressed through the creation of a different form, through the design of new communities that look to promote diversity. When measured on a scale looking at four elements of complete communities - living, working, moving, thriving - New York City and San Francisco rank at the top, while Atlanta and Dallas ranked quite low.  Defining elements  The 'complete community' is seen as a way to deal with issues of social isolation, address inefficient land uses and meet the needs of diverse households. A common definition of a complete community is one where people live, work and play, and where the automobile is left at home in favour of walking and public transport. This is supported by a diverse housing mix. While each community applies the term in its own way as part of its community plans, there are several defining elements.  Densification  A benchmark for complete communities is access to services within a five-minute walk, which contrasts the typical sprawl associated with the suburbs.  Diverse housing mix  In Canada, many municipalities have focused on providing a mix of housing types as the key component of creating a complete community based on directives from provincial and regional policies.  Diverse land use mix  Complete communities advocate for densification within existing neighbourhoods to provide services to users which sometimes run in contrast to zoning regulations currently there. Barriers to complete communities include zoning and bylaws that do not promote building with diverse uses and design in mind.  Employment options  One central goal of developing complete communities involves promoting a concentration of employment opportunities, with a labour force both working and living within the geographic boundaries of the community. This is believed to be a response to the negative effects associated with commuter towns.  Transportation options  As the suburbs grew, roadways that prioritised the automobile grew with them. Especially in the United States, widened and expanded metropolitan areas led to poor inner- suburb communities, which worked to destroy the connection to neighbourhoods, institutions, parks and town centres. Planners began to advocate for a community plan where a mix of housing types and uses in compact form would be centred around transportation nodes for ease of mobility of residents. Additionally, some transportation planners take planning for a connected community one step further by pushing for inclusive multi-modal and equitable transportation systems that work for people of all ages, ability, income and racial demography.  Debate/Critique  Although there is a general definition for complete communities, the term sometimes has differing meanings within certain contexts. Within many municipal plans the term complete community is used to describe a city mandate, without a given description of how the community defines the term. This leads to the term being used for a number of different objectives, depending on the goals of the specific community. While many planners look to use urban policy as a way of creating a diverse housing mix, some critics argue that it is actually market pressures rather than planners and policy makers who are actually creating the increase in the share of multi-family housing in suburban areas. Most developers will not actually use the term ‚Äòcomplete communities,‚Äô however, many larger master- planning developers will talk about providing a range of housing types as a way of remaining competitive and selling community.  Examples  The following are examples of places that have been described as complete communities: * Kirkland, Washington The following are examples of places that have gone through, or are currently undergoing, a planning process that is informed by the concept of a complete community: * Metro Vancouver, British Columbia * City of North Vancouver, British Columbia * Winnipeg, Manitoba * Greater Golden Horseshoe, Ontario * Austin, Texas * Vancouver Campus of the University of British Columbia, British Columbia * City of Nanaimo, British Columbia * Town of Gibsons, British Columbia * City of St. Albert, Alberta See also *Compact City *Complete Streets *Garden City Movement *Healthy community design *New Urbanism *Smart Growth References Category:Community building ","title":"Complete communities"},{"id":"52208546","text":"Eucalyptus froggattii, commonly known as the Kamarooka mallee, is a species of mallee or small tree that is endemic to Victoria.

The flowers are white to cream-coloured, cup-shaped to pear shaped in side view, square in cross section, long and wide with the valves enclosed below rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus froggattii was first formally described in 1934 by William Blakely from a specimen collected at Kamarooka near Bendigo by Alfred Howitt, and the description was published in Blakely's book A Key to the Eucalypts. The specific epithet (foggattii) honours the entomologist, Walter Wilson Froggatt. Distribution and habitat Kamarooka mallee is usually only found in remnant woodland or shrubland in farmlands between Horsham, Bendigo, Charlton and Nhill in Victoria, but some populations are conserved in the Kamarooka State Park (now part of the Greater Bendigo National Park) and in flora reserves such as the Wychitella Nature Conservation Reserve and Mount Arapiles-Tooan State Park.

The notion of asymptotic dimension was introduced my Mikhail Gromov in his 1993 monograph Asymptotic invariants of infinite groups in the context of geometric group theory, as a quasi-isometry invariant of finitely generated groups. As shown by Guoliang Yu, finitely generated groups of finite homotopy type with finite asymptotic dimension satisfy the Novikov conjecture. Asymptotic dimension has important applications in geometric analysis and index theory. Formal definition Let X be a metric space and n\\\\ge 0 be an integer. We say that asdim(X)\\\\le n if for every R\\\\ge 1 there exists a uniformly bounded cover \\\\mathcal U of X such that every closed R-ball in X intersects at most n+1 subsets from \\\\mathcal U. Here 'uniformly bounded' means that sup_{U\\\\in \\\\mathcal U} diam(U) <\\\\infty . We then define the asymptotic dimension asdim(X) as the smallest integer n\\\\ge 0 such that asdim(X)\\\\le n , if at least one such n exists, and define asdim(X):=\\\\infty otherwise. Also, one says that a family (X_i)_{i\\\\in I} of metric spaces satisfies asdim(X)\\\\le n uniformly if for every R\\\\ge 1 and every i\\\\in I there exists a cover \\\\mathcal U_i of X_i by sets of diameter at most D(R)<\\\\infty (independent of i) such that every closed R-ball in X_i intersects at most n+1 subsets from \\\\mathcal U_i.

Asymptotic dimension in geometric group theory Asymptotic dimension achieved particular prominence in geometric group theory after a 1998 paper of Guoliang Yu , which proved that if G is a finitely generated group of finite homotopy type (that is with a classifying space of the homotopy type of a finite CW-complex) such that asdim(G)<\\\\infty, then G satisfies the Novikov conjecture.

He emigrated from England in 1633 to New England, and eventually co-founded, with Edmond Farrington, Edmund Needham, Abraham Pierson the Elder, Thomas Sayre, Josiah Stanborough, George Welbe, Henry Walton, Job Sayre, and Edward Howell, the town of Southampton, New York in 1640.

The earliest Englishman bearing the name \\"Halsey\\" lived in the western end of Cornwall. The home of the Cornish Halseys was a manor of Lanesley. According to Halsey's Thomas Halsey of Hertfordshire..., that in the time of Richard I (crowned 1189), this estate comprised \\"the lands of the family surnamed de Als, now Hals, so called from the barton, and dismantled manor of Als, now Alse and Alesa, in Buryan, as tradition saith, or Bar Alston, Alston, in Devon in possession of Trevanin, and others, whereof they were Lords, and in particular William de Als in the beginning of the reign of King Henry III of England, that marred Mary, the daughter of Francis de Bray, was possessed thereof, father of Simon de Als who lived in Halsham in Yorkshire from him denominated.\\" The Halseys of Cornwall and Devon were related to those of the name living at the Great Gaddesden Parsonage in Hertfordshire, England. In Cussan's History of Hertfordshire, he mentions a Thomas Halsey who was baptized 2 Jan 1592, who was a mercer in London, living in Naples in 1621, and afterward, it is believed, an emigrant to America. The first mention of this family found by Cussan was of a Richard Halsey of Great Gadesden in 1458. In 1559, when the parish registers commence, there were four families of this game in that place: Halsey of the Parsonage; Halsey of the Wood; Halsey of the Northend; and Halsey of the Lane. The descent to Thomas Halsey, the Southampton settler, is as follows: # John Halsey of the Parsonage (of the Parsonage, Great Gaddesden), living 1512, had son, # William (of the Parsonage, Great Gaddesden), who d. in 1546, and who had w. Alice, who d. 1557, and ch. Robert, William, Thomas, Harry, Isabel, Jane and Elizabeth. # William (of the Parsonage), the second son of William, d. May, 1596, had w. Anne and ch. John, William, Robert, Ralph, Edward, Thomas, Triamore, Philip, Joan and Anne. # Robert, the third son of the second Wiliam Halsey, died Oct. 1618, and m. Dorothy, d. of Wm. Downes of Linslade, Co. of Bucks. She d. Sept. 1620. They had ch. William, bap. June 23, 1690, Thomas bap. Jan. 2, 1590/91, Duncombe, James, Edward, Jane, Joane, Mary, Amy, Ann, Avis, Hester, Sara and Dorothy. # Thomas, the second son of Robert, is the one identified as the Southampton emigrant. The complete pedigree of this Halsey family, beginning with John Halsey of the Parsonage (1512), can be viewed here. It is noted in Howell's History of Southampton that \\"this family, like many others of Southampton, was of high social position in the mother country. One of its representatives in England, Rt. Hon. Thomas Frederick Halsey, 1st Baronet, was a member of Parliament (1874‚Äì1906). Burke's shows the direct descent of Thomas Halsey (c. 1731‚Äì1788), a British merchant and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1768 and 1784, from John Halsey of the Parsonage (living 1512) above.  Halsey in America  Thomas Halsey's arrival in America was connected with the colonization efforts lead by John Winthrop. Those who founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony were Puritans: like their Plymouth counterparts. Thomas Halsey was one of the earliest settlers of Lynn, Massachusetts (as early as 1637), but it is believed Thomas reached Boston as early as 1633, the year in which he was granted his coat of arms. In a record that survived a fire at Lynn, it is recorded that in 1638 he was allotted one hundred acres of land. When the migration to Long Island in 1640 began, Winthrop remarks that the Long Island company, in \\"finding themselves straightened, looked about for a new plantation.\\" Having obtained their content from Winthrop, on March 10, 1639, articles of agreement had been signed at Lynn, and Thomas Halsey, being one of the signers, described the conditions and terms under which the new settlement was to be founded. It is recorded and written in Jacob Lafayette Halsey's Thomas Halsey of Hertfordshire, England, and Southampton, Long Island, 1581‚Äì1679 that Thomas \\"remained many years in Southampton and was the richest man in the place;\\" and that he had \\"much influence in town affairs\\" and \\"was active in establishing the Connecticut jurisdiction, and in 1669 was a representative.\\" From the town records of Southampton, it was recorded that Thomas Halsey was not only an active citizen but one \\"possessed of independence of spirit and a strong will, and not always respectful to his fellow townsmen,\\" although he had been well-educated and styled a \\"gentleman\\" in the records.  Halsey House  Thomas Halsey Homestead (built 1648, Southampton, New York)According to the museum, the collection includes \\"17th- and 18th-century furnishings, a Dominy clock, and a rare 16th-century Breeches Bible, this version speaks of Adam and Eve wearing 'breeches made of fig leaves.'\\" The grounds include herb and flower gardens and an orchard that are overseen by the Southampton Colonial Society. The Halsey House is also a common gathering place for social events, and a variety of programs open to the public.Coat of arms for Thomas Halsey of Hertfordshire, England & Southampton, New York  Family  Thomas married (1st) Phoebe before 1637. She was murdered by two Pequot Native Americans in 1649. He married (2nd) Ann Johnes on 25 July 1660, widow of Edward Johnes. Children of Thomas Halsey and Phoebe (d. 1649): # Thomas Halsey (b. abt. 1627) m. Mary (d. 20 Dec 1699) # Isaac Halsey (b. abt. 1628/29) m. Mary # Daniel Halsey (b. abt. 1630‚Äì1633, d. abt. 1682), buried at Wickapogue, New York, m. Jemima # Elizabeth Halsey m. Richard Howell (son of Edward Howell, founder of Southampton, New York)  Coat of arms  The arms of this family are said by Cussan to have been granted to William Halsey, the elder brother of Thomas of Southampton, in 1633, and are as follows: Argent, on a pile sable, three griffin's heads erased of the first.

Career=2015‚Äì2016 From an early age, Sarai enjoyed singing, dancing, and performing. In 2015 her parents signed her up for a talent and modeling program run by Actors, Models and Talent for Christ, and she was signed by a New York agent. In 2016 she auditioned for the lead role in the Spanish-language \\"Soy Yo\\" music video and was selected from a pool of more than 100 applicants. Cast as a \\"nerdy\\" tween with a \\"sassy\\" and \\"confident\\" attitude, she traverses the \\"mean streets\\" of Brooklyn, facing up to taunts and bullies. The music video, released on September 7, 2016, garnered over one million views upon its September 2016 release and logged over 6.5 million views as of early November. Gonzalez was viewed as a \\"Latina icon\\" for \\"female empowerment, identity and self-worth\\". The New York Times opined: > Soy Yo seemed to appear at precisely the right moment‚Äîa defiant, and > adorable, rebuke to the anti-Latino rhetoric of the Trump campaign, and > haters in general. \\"Don't worry if they don't accept you,\\" goes the song's > chorus, in Spanish. \\"If they criticize you, just say, 'That's me.'\\" Gonzalez' character inspired fans to post artwork, memes, and childhood photos of themselves on social media under the hashtag #SoyYo. In October, Fusion released a video of Gonzalez giving advice on how to develop self-confidence. Gonzalez appeared in her first speaking role in a 30-second Latino get out the vote video produced by Civic Innovation Works in advance of the 2016 US elections. She also appeared in the two-minute \\"Be You y Vota\\" video produced by People for the American Way, in which she encourages her father and neighbors to cast their ballots and dances as she leads them to the polling station. Gonzalez was a guest at the Hispanic Heritage reception at the White House on October 12, 2016, where she shared a hug with President Barack Obama. 2017 Gonzalez was cast in the lead role in Watermelon (2017), a New York University thesis short film written and directed by Toryn Seabrooks. Gonzalez played a \\"12 year old frumpy wallflower\\" who wants to join a cheerleaders squad. 2018 The first volume of a multi-part chapter book series, co- authored by Gonzalez and Monica Brown and published by Scholastic, was released in September 2018. Titled Sarai and the Meaning of Awesome, the series is based on events in Gonzalez' life and is aimed at readers aged 7 to 10. Scholastic has since released volume 2, Sarai in the Spotlight, and volume 3, Sarai Saves the Music. Each volume is available in English and Spanish editions.

Located in Nha Trang, it was established during the French colonization of Vietnam. It operates directly under the authority of the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. Early history Established by Alexandre Yersin in 1895, it specialized in the study of animal disease, their prophylaxis and treatment. Yersin bought a 500 hectare property in Suoi Giao (about 20 km outside Nha Trang) on which to raise 600 goats, sheep, cattle and water buffalo, all needed for research at the institute. The property was cleared by Yersin and his coolies, and they built stables for the research animals. Yersin hung a bell around the neck of each animal to keep local tigers from attacking them. Within a few years, veterinarians joined the researchers at the institute and developed an anti-plague serum for human use and several serum for use in cattle. In the first few years, Yersin and his team studied most of the local diseases commonly found in animals in Indochina, developing treatments and making them available to the local populace. The research was expensive; despite government subsidies and donations, he would have to find a local source of financing. Yersin introduced rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) to the property. The first crop planted in 1898 gave a latex harvest in 1904 (this was sold to the local Michelin producer). The rubber crop helped support the institute‚Äôs activities. (This property was bequeathed to the Nha Trang Institute after his death.) Ten years after the introduction of the rubber plants, Yersin introduced Cinchona plants for the production of quinine. His effort would take 20 years to give favourable results. After his death, Yersin was buried on the Suoi Giao property. An epidemic of plague came to Nha Trang in 1898 and was one of the first diseases studied at the institute. The Nha Trang facilities were placed under the supervision of the Pasteur Institute in Paris in 1904 and Yersin assumed the leadership of the facility that same year. Later history After the reunification of Vietnam in 1975, the Nha Trang facility was made into a provincial hygiene institute by the government. In 1990, Nha Trang rejoined the family of worldwide Pasteur Institutes. In 1992, scientists from Nha Trang traveled to Paris to study at the Pasteur Institute. In 1997, a museum dedicated to Alexandre Yersin was opened in Nha Trang, attracting many tourists. The institute is still conducting medical research.

The work was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic to commemorate the orchestra's sesquicentennial anniversary. It was first performed by the soloist Thomas Stacy and the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Kurt Masur at Avery Fisher Hall on January 27, 1994. Rorem dedicated the piece to Thomas Stacy. The work is one of the few prominent contemporary English horn concertos, along with James MacMillan's The World's Ransoming. Composition=Background The concerto was written over the winter of 1991‚Äì1992, predominantly while Rorem was in the hospital. Rorem described the composition process as \\"one of physical stress,\\" adding, \\"when I worked at all it was through a hazy protestant need to meet deadlines.\\" The composer thus originally intended to call the piece Meditations in an Emergency after the eponymous poem by Frank O'Hara. Rorem opted for a straightforward title, however, noting his lack of belief that \\"music, especially non-vocal music, necessarily reflects its maker's mood in medias res, or what people can agree‚Äîas they can with poetry and pictures‚Äîthat a specific piece is angry or happy or noble, much less that it represents an ocean or an operating room.\\" He added, \\"When a gloomy composer labors on a lengthy project he checks the gloom at his studio door, along with his aches and pains, and functions in a kind of limbo. (A definition of the Artist: One who exists outside himself, and has something to show for it. He is the least egotistical of citizens).\\" Given his lack of mobility, this was the first piece that Rorem composed directly onto paper without any keyboard instrument. The work was started on December 6, 1991 and completed on June 13, 1992. In the score program notes, he wrote: Structure The work has a duration of approximately 23 minutes and is cast in five movements: #Preamble and Amble #Love Letter #Recurring Dream #Perpetual Motion #Medley and Prayer Instrumentation The work is scored for solo English horn and an orchestra comprising two flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani, four percussionists, harp, piano (doubling celesta), and strings. Reception Reviewing the world premiere, Alex Ross of The New York Times wrote, \\"The concerto is simply a sequence of five sketches, with melody interspersed; the orchestral fabric is subtle enough for the mild-mannered English horn to assume a convincing solo role.

She was a member of the New York Academy of Sciences and a Capitular Tertiary of St. Dominic. Chambers served as principal of the High School for Girls in Memphis, Tennessee, and opened a normal school for advanced pupils in Georgetown, Kentucky, and in Memphis, Tennessee, she established a girls school. Ketchum was the founding editor of The Lotus, a monthly magazine, and she published the textbook, Botany for academies and colleges: consisting of plant development and structure from seaweed to clematis. Noted for her poetic talent, her \\"Semper Fidelis,\\" published in Harper's Magazine, was said to be one of the most finished productions of American literature in its day. Early life and education Annelizah \\"Annie\\" Chambers was born near Georgetown on November 8, 1824, in Scott County, Kentucky. Her siblings included Fielding Thomas, Fenora Thomas, Beline, Renette, and Le Wilma. She was the youngest living daughter of Violetta Bradford and Major Benjamin Stuart Chambers, a lawyer. Major Chambers was one of the twenty who made the \\"forlorn hope\\" at the Battle of the River Thames in 1813, one of the six who came out alive from that massacre. Violetta was the eldest daughter of Judge Fielding Bradford of Kentucky who with his brother, John, founded the Kentucky Gazette, at Lexington, Kentucky, in August, 1787, the first newspaper west of the Allegheny Mountains. In early childhood, while growing up at Acacia Grove (now called Cardome), she was often found poring over books which children usually count dull. Her educational advantages were of the very best. In the classics, she was equally at home with belles-lettres, natural sciences, and mathematics. In modern languages, music and drawing she excelled. She was tutored at home until she attended Georgetown Female College where she graduated with the M.A. degree. Early career On December 22, 1844, after her father's death, she married her cousin, William Bradford, also known as Joseph Woods Bradford. Only a few years later and after the birth of two children, according to one account, the husband died and she was left a widow. In another account, she separated from him and was divorced. She was appointed principal in 1855 of the High School for Girls in Memphis, Tennessee, where she partnered with the Young Men's High School to establish a co-educational class in elocution. She met Charlotte Cushman, a famous actress who gave her lessons in public speaking. During school vacations, she gave a series of popular lectures which then paid for the girls school's equipment for chemistry, physics and astronomy. In 1858, she married Leonidas Ketchum of Memphis. From 1859 to 1861, she served as the founding editor of The Lotus, a monthly magazine. It published a few numbers at Memphis, when the magazine was suspended on account of the American Civil War in 1861. It was rather above the average, and published some of the earliest verses of the Massachusetts writer, Nora Perry, who subsequently won a national reputation. Civil War years When the American Civil War began, her husband enlisted in the Army of the C.S.A. and became an adjutant of the 38th Tennessee Infantry, which led the van at the Battle of Shiloh. There, he received the wound which resulted in his death in 1863. When Memphis fell to the Federal army, a British Legation visited the city and Sir Henry Percy Anderson met Ketchum, her poetry having become very popular in England. The British delegate asked her to improve up on the latest popular Civil War song, \\"The Bonnie Blue Flag,\\" and she published the new verses under the title \\"The Gathering Song.\\" The Federal authorities then arrested Ketchum and required her to take the oath of allegiance. Upon her refusal, she and her children were banished from Memphis. She returned north to her native town, Georgetown, Kentucky, and there opened a normal school for advanced pupils. Post-war career After the Civil War, she returned to Memphis in 1866 to find her home destroyed. She established a girls school in which she was assisted by her daughter. In the summer of 1867, her son, who was on vacation from Sewanee where he was studying for the ministry, died of cholera. Upon his death, she left Memphis for Europe, residing for several years in England and France. She documented her journeys while living abroad in a series of articles called \\"Gypsying\\" which she sold to U.S. magazines to pay her way. Eventually, she converted and became a Roman Catholic. While in Paris, she became a novitiate in a Dominican convent on May 24, 1876. Because she did not live in a cloister, she became a Capitular Tertiary of St. Dominic. She wore traditional women's clothes but donned a Dominican habit on the Catholic Church's holy feast days and she was buried in it. Her religious name was Sister Amabilis, which she used while she continued her intellectual life as a botanist.See for example the reference to correspondence with Sister Amabilis in the biography of Tennessee botanist Dr. Augustin Gattinger. Botany for Academies and Colleges (1889) Upon her return to the U.S., she fixed upon New York City as a place of residence, writing for journals and building up over 100 lectures on literature, science and art. It was during this time that she published her novel with Lippincott, and her textbook Botany for academies and colleges: consisting of plant development and structure from seaweed to clematis, which included illustrations she had made during her visits to European gardens. In Will Hale's 1903 summary of Southern periodicals, he described his great respect for her as a scientist and writer, describing her through the eyes of a woman of his acquaintance: \\"In 1887 a Philadelphia house brought out Mrs. Chambers-Ketchum's Botany for Academies and Colleges. During the preparation of that work, I had the honor of entertaining her as a guest in my home. A lady once gave this account of her: 'She has a handsome forehead; mouth large; large black eyes, beautiful more with brilliancy than softness. She is a brilliant talker. ... She is a glorious woman, and a poetess.'\\" Ketchum's writings were numerous and included \\"Nellie Bracken: a tale of forty years ago\\" (a novel published in 1855 by Lippincott), \\"Gypsying\\" (letters of travel), \\"Christmas Carillons: and other poems\\" (a volume of poems published by Appleton in 1888), as well as a large number of lectures on science, literature and art. She composed an entirely original work on botany, Botany for academies and colleges: consisting of plant development and structure from seaweed to clematis, as a textbook for academies and colleges, containing in its three hundred duodecimo pages twice as much instruction as could be found in other text-books in use.

The reverse side of the talisman. The Talisman of Charlemagne is a 9th-century Carolingian reliquary encolpion that may once have belonged to Charlemagne and is purported to contain a fragment of the True Cross. It is the only surviving piece of goldwork which can be connected with Charlemagne himself with some degree of probability, but the connection has been seriously questioned.Thomas Labusiak: \\"¬ªEr schenkte der Kirche viele heilige Gef√§√üe aus Gold und Silber.¬´ Goldschmiedekunst in der Zeit Karls des Gro√üen.\\" in Peter van den Brink, Sarvenaz Ayooghi (ed.): Karl der Gro√üe ‚Äì Charlemagne. Karls Kunst. Dresden 2014, p. 92. The talisman is now kept in Rheims in the Palace of Tau (inv.no. G 7).  Description The 7.3 cm long medallion is one of the few surviving items of goldsmithery from the ninth century AD. It is not really a piece of religious artwork, but a reliquary for personal purposes, an encolpion.Imhof, Winterer: Karl der Gro√üe. Leben und Wirkung, Kunst und Architektur. p. 104. Originally, it was set with two large sapphires in the centre, with the supposed hair of Mary between them, but in 1804 they were replaced with a piece of enamel glass. The talisman is covered in sumptuous gemstones and filigree work, but it lacks the figural depictions, coloured enamels, animal designs and interlace patterns which are common in older works. The work is thus dominated by the filigree work itself, along with pearls and jewels in box and palmette designs. Thus the arrow-shaped repouss√© decorations between the filigree could recall motifs which were previously common. The shape of the amulet combines three different forms with their own meanings. Firstly, it mimicked the shape of the Palestinian pilgrims' ampules which had been particularly common in the west in the fifth and sixth centuries, and thereby indicated the origins of hair which it originally contained. Secondly, it uses four emeralds and a central stone to create the a cross, just like St. Stephen's Purse. Finally, the magnificent front serves as a frame for the relic visible behind the translucent gemstone. It is likely that it was used to heal or protect a high ranking individual.Imhof, Winterer: Karl der Gro√üe. Leben und Wirkung, Kunst und Architektur. p. 102.  Contemporary significance  According to legend, the talisman was a gift from Caliph Harun al-Rashid to Charlemagne in 801. In fact, the reliquary appears to be a late work of Aachen in the time of Charlemagne, based on stylistic factors. It originally held hair purported to belong to the Virgin Mary.http://stoessel.wordpress.com/talisman-karls-des-grossen/ Charlemagne's pre-eminent theologian, Alcuin (735-804) wrote in a letter to Archbishop √Üthelhard of Canterbury, that he was trying to stop the emerging custom of wearing reliquaries around the neck, since it was \\"better to imitate the example of the saints with the heart than to carry their bones around in little sacks... this is a Pharisee superstition.\\"\\"Melius est in corde sanctorum imitari exempla quam in sacculis portare ossa [‚Ä¶] Haec est pharisaica superstitio,\\" Monumenta Alcuiniana p. 719 (Online). Subsequent history  The talisman is meant to have been found around Charlemagne's neck when his tomb in Aachen Cathedral was opened by Emperor Otto III in the year 1000 or when it was opened by Frederick Barbarossa on 8 January 1166. The truth of this story is not clear. (PDF). It would then have formed part of the Aachen cathedral treasury, but again there are many doubts about this because a medallion containing the hair of the Virgin Mary is not mentioned in the records until the 12th century.http://www.alphilrevues.ch/d/revue/1/6/29 The connection to Charlemagne is mentioned for the first time in 1620.Blaise de Montesquiou-Fezensac, \\"Le Talisman de Charlemagne\\", Art de France. Revue annuelle de l‚Äôart ancien et moderne, II (1962), p. 69 Until 1804, the Talisman was kept in the Aachen Cathedral Treasury, but then the first Bishop of Aachen gave it to the Empress Josephine, wife of Napoleon Bonaparte, along with a bone fragment from Charlemagne's right arm, on the occasion of her visit to Aachen, during the procession of Corpus Christi on 9 December 1804 in order to thank Napoleon for returning the relics of the cathedral which had been confiscated during the French Revolution. She gave it to her daughter Hortense, who passed it in turn to her son, Napoleon III. At the fall of the Second French Empire, Empress Eugenie entrusted it to Henri Conneau who hid it in a wall of his house and transmitted it to her in England. In 1919 it passed from to the Archbishop of Rheims, Cardinal Louis Lu√ßon, who placed it in the church treasury of the Abbey of Saint-Remi. The exchange of the hair of Mary for a piece of the True Cross may have taken place in this period.Georg Minkenberg, Sisi Ben Kayed: Verlorene Sch√§tze.

The medical use of cannabis is permitted in certain circumstances. History=Prohibition (1927) In 1914, New York first began to restrict cannabis by requiring a prescription to obtain the drug. In an amendment to the Boylan Bill, they added \\"Cannabis indica, which is the Indian hemp from which the East Indian drug called hashish is manufactured,\\" to the city's list of restricted drugs. The New York Times on the following day commented: Devotees of hashish are now hardly numerous enough here to count, but they are likely to increase as other narcotics become harder to obtain. In their study of the history of marijuana prohibition, Richard J. Bonnie & Charles H. Whitebread note that \\"only four articles about marijuana appeared in the major New York newspaper during the entire period from 1914 until 1927.\\" In 1927, New York removed the medical purposes and restricted cannabis completely. In New York City, there were more than of marijuana growing like weeds throughout the boroughs until 1951, when the \\"White Wing Squad\\", headed by the Sanitation Department General Inspector John E. Gleason, was charged with destroying the many pot farms that had sprouted up across the city. The Brooklyn Public Library reports: this group was held to a high moral standard and was prohibited from \\"entering saloons, using foul language, and neglecting horses.\\" The Squad found the most weed in Queens but even in Brooklyn dug up \\"millions of dollars\\" worth of the plants, many as \\"tall as Christmas trees\\". Gleason oversaw incineration of the plants in Woodside, Queens. La Guardia Committee (1939-1944) In 1939, New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia assigned a committee to investigate the issue of cannabis in his city. The committee released its report in 1944, concluding that the \\"gateway theory\\" was largely false, and that cannabis was not widely associated with addiction, school children, or juvenile delinquency. The report infuriated Harry Anslinger, commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, who branded it unscientific. Rockefeller Drug Laws (1973) In 1973, New York governor Nelson Rockefeller signed legislation increasing the penalty for selling or more of heroin, morphine, \\"raw or prepared opium,\\" cocaine, or cannabis or possessing or more of the same substances, was a minimum of 15 years to life in prison, and a maximum of 25 years to life in prison. Partial decriminalization (1977) In 1977, New York decriminalized possession of 25 grams or less of marijuana, to an infraction with a $100 fine. However, possession in public view remained a misdemeanor, and civil rights advocates stated that this was used as a loophole to unfairly arrest. A New York Times editorial noted in 2012: =New York City= In response to the continued arrests for marijuana possession, in 2014 New York City mayor Bill de Blasio directed the NYPD to cease arrests, and instead issue tickets, for small possession even in cases where the 1977 law might allow an arrest, such as cannabis entering \\"public view\\" during a stop-and- frisk. However, the Village Voice noted in 2016 that despite a sudden drop following de Blasio's direction, arrests have \\"gone back up just as quickly.\\" In 2018 the Manhattan and Brooklyn district attorneys announced that they would continue reducing the set of offenses that they would prosecute. Medical cannabis legalization (2014) In July 2014, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed legislation permitted the use of cannabis for medical purposes, following a \\"lengthy, emotional debate\\" in the issue in the Senate and 49‚Äì10 Senate vote. Cuomo's signing began an 18-month window for the state Department of Health to enact a medical marijuana program to provide non- smoked methods of cannabis consumption to patients. The legislation awarded five contracts to private marijuana growers who would each be allowed to operate four dispensaries. State law as of 2016 Offenses related to the possession or sale of marijuana and \\"concentrated cannabis\\", outside those allowed by the state's medical marijuana statute, are defined in Article 221 of the New York State Penal Law. The former term is defined in the state's Public Health Law as \\"all parts of the plant of the genus Cannabis, whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds or resin.\\" Stalks from the mature plant, fiber, oil and cake made from it, sterilized seeds and compounds or preparations from them are not considered marijuana. \\"Concentrated cannabis\\", meant primarily to refer to hashish, refers to the plant's \\"separated resin, whether crude or purified\\" and any substance, whether derived from the plant or not, containing more than 2.5% by weight of delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), delta-8 dibenzopyran, delta-1-THC or delta-1 (6) monoterpene, an isomer of the last compound. Possession of less than of marijuana, in any form, is unlawful possession of marijuana, punishable by a fine of no more than $100 if the defendant has no convictions for the offense within the last three years. Those who do can be fined up to $200; on the third conviction within that time period the maximum fine rises to $250 with the possibility of a 15-day jail sentence as well. The offense is considered a violation, the lowest level of offense defined in state law, and thus does not show up on a criminal record. If the marijuana is burning or in public view, no matter the amount, or is between 25 g and , it is fifth-degree criminal possession of marijuana, a Class B misdemeanor, carrying a possible three-month sentence. Amounts in the range are fourth-degree criminal possession of marijuana, a Class A misdemeanor for which offenders can receive up to six months in jail. Convictions for these offenses will result in a criminal record. Amounts higher than 8 ounces are felonies, all of which carry a minimum prison term of three years in New York. Third-degree criminal possession of marijuana, a Class E felony with up to four years as a possible punishment, applies to amounts between 8 and , or one pound. Those convicted of second-degree criminal possession of marijuana, a Class D felony with a maximum sentence of seven years, will have been in possession of up to and can expect to serve up to seven years at most. First-degree criminal possession of marijuana applies to those with more than 10 pounds, a Class C felony for which offenders may spend 15 years in prison. Offenses related to the sale of marijuana start with fifth-degree criminal sale of marijuana, a class B misdemeanor that covers amounts less than . Fourth-degree criminal sale of marijuana, a class A misdemeanor, covers sales between that amount and . Amounts up to are third- degree criminal sale of marijuana, a Class E felony. Sales in the 4‚Äì16-oz. range get the offender a conviction for second-degree criminal sale of marijuana, a Class D felony. That offense also applies to any sale of a lesser amount to a minor. Sales of more than a pound are considered first-degree criminal sale of marijuana, a Class C felony. Legalization study (2018) In his 2018 State of the State address Governor Cuomo urged the New York State Legislature to fund a study on the effects of legalizing marijuana for recreational use. The proposed study would be conducted by the Department of Health to examine a wide variety of issues, including the legal, economic, and social ramifications recreational marijuana could have on New York. The Department of Health completed its study and has recommended the legalization of marijuana in New York, citing economic, public health, and public safety benefits. Cuomo stated that New York should \\"legalize the adult use of recreational marijuana once and for all,\\" and that his marijuana legalization proposal would be including the state's 2019 budget plan. The study was followed by an amended Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act bill, which would legalize and regulate cannabis in the state. Additional reforms (2019) New York enacted legislation expanding the decriminalization of recreational use of cannabis, but did not legalize it. Proposals to fully legalize cannabis for recreational use= (2020) Once again, Governor Cuomo made a push for statewide legalization in his State of the State address. While this did seem a likely possibility in January, the sudden emergence of COVID-19 caused both Governor Cuomo and the state legislature to shift priorities. As a result, cannabis legalization was excluded from the state budget passed in April.

Inspired by The Vagina Monologues, The Climate Monologues consists of a series of monologues and original songs from the point of view of people affected by and working to prevent climate change. The play premiered at the Orcas Island Grange in Eastsound, WA, on May 16, 2010. On March 11, 2011, Abreu received The Spirit of Nature, Ecology and Society Environmental Justice Award. at The Culture of Climate Change colloquium at the City University of New York (CUNY) Graduate Center in New York City, for her presentation of The Climate Monologues. Abreu performed an updated version of the show on March 27, 2016, in the Los Angeles Women's Theatre Festival. Orcas Issues said in a review of a September 8, 2016, performance at Random Howse in Eastsound, WA: \\"Sharon Abreu is an inspired listener. She listens to the stories of West Virginian coal mining families, NW activists, Tribal leaders, Mississippi teachers, a Colorado cowgirl and Orcas‚Äô own Lea Bossler and tells them back to us in compelling, non-scientific language about the world we live in.\\" Theater reviewer Lexi Orphanos wrote, \\"Abreu‚Äôs monologues bring a humanity to the statistics that plaster our newspapers and Facebook feeds.

The play was featured in chapter 6, Orcas Island's Irthlingz: Community Art as Activism in the 2016 book, A Song to Save the Salish Sea: Musical Performance as Environmental Activism, by Mark Pedelty, published by Indiana University Press.  Plot/Structure  The Climate Monologues is made up of a varying number of monologues in the voices of real people affected by or working to address climate change. Each of the monologues deals with a topic related to climate change, such as health and mountaintop removal mining, alternative energy, rail freight transport of coal and oil, and citizen activism. A recurring theme is the individual citizen taking successful action to address issues related to climate change and energy. New monologues have been added over the years to highlight emerging issues relating to climate change. The number and order of the monologues has been varied to accommodate time limitations and dramatic considerations.

The Act established a fund to support the construction of provincial highways as part of the post-World War I reconstruction program of Robert Borden's Union government. Background In the mid-nineteenth century, the primary modes of transportation were rail and waterways, and authority over them was granted to the federal government under Canada's Constitution; roads were thought of as a local concern and were delegated to the provinces. As the automobile rose in prominence in the early 20th century, organizations such as the Good Roads Movement and local motor clubs put pressure on governments to provide improved roads. Several provinces established their own highway authorities to coordinate the development of regional road networks. The federal government's first effort to fund highway construction came with the Railway Grade Crossing Fund in 1907. Robert Borden's Conservative government first proposed a federal assistance program for provincial road construction in 1913, but the program was rejected by the Liberal-dominated Senate over opposition to acting in an area of provincial jurisdiction. Interest in road funding was put aside during World War I, however automobile interest groups (including the 1915 establishment of the Canadian Automobile Association) maintained pressure on the federal government. Following the war, Borden's Union government established a reconstruction program including the Canada Highways Act, which passed in 1919. Highways funding The Act established a fund to provide financial assistance to provincial highway projects, with an emphasis on encouraging interprovincial highway connections. The fund, administered by the Department of Railways and Canals, provided a maximum of $20 million to approved projects between 1 April 1919 and 31 March 1924. To qualify for funding, a province was required to develop a five-year provincial highways plan, including primary and secondary designations. Upon approval, the Dominion fund would subsidize 40% of the cost of construction. Work on provincial highways proceeded more slowly than anticipated. The fund was not depleted as of the expiry date in 1924, and so the deadline was extended to 31 March 1928. A report prepared by the Department showed that the fund contributed $19,596,388 toward $48,990,092 of provincial road construction, funding of roads in all nine provinces. Notes : Newfoundland did not become a province until 1949 and thus did not benefit from Canada Highways Act funding.

Its headwaters are at the Marshall Flowage near Malay Falls and the mouth of the river is at the head of the Northeast Arm in Sheet Harbour, Nova Scotia. East River begins at the Marshall Flowage, near Malay Falls. It flows southwest through the Malay Falls and Ruth Falls Flowages. Lake Mulgrave, a large lake west of the Marshall Flowage, flows into the Marshall Flowage via the Mulgrave River. The Fifteen Mile Stream also flows into the Marshall Flowage from the north. It extends northward, into Guysborough County. Grant River, a short river, flows into the Ruth Falls Flowage. The East River watershed system, along with the neighboring West River system, encompass a total area of 988 km2. Around 1863, a sawmill was built at the head of the river by Demming & McFarlane, who were a lumber company. The company did not succeed financially however, and was dissolved a few years later. The first sulphide pulp mill in Canada was built by the Halifax Wood Fibre Company in October 1885, at East River, Sheet Harbour. Since the discovery of the sulphite process in 1866, the news had traveled to William Chisholm, a lumber manufacturer in Halifax who had 60 thousand acres (24,281 hectares, or 242 km2) of woodland on the Sheet Harbour rivers. Chisholm decided to try the method out at the head of East River. The mill was closed in January 1891, due to the high costs of importing sulphide from the United States. The cookhouse which was used at the mill was bought by the residents of Watt Section and was floated down the harbour to the community.

It is in the Archdeaconry of Dorchester in the Diocese of Oxford. The church was built in the 10th or 11th century as an Anglo-Saxon minster with a tower. In the 12th century it was rebuilt as a cruciform Norman building centred on a crossing under the tower. Gothic additions to the church were made several times in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. The church is a Grade I listed building. Parish The ancient parish was one of the largest in Oxfordshire, and included the townships of Weald, Lew, Aston, Cote, Shifford, Chimney and Lower Haddon.Crossley & Currie 1996, pages 6‚Äì8 In 1857 the parish was split into the three ecclesiastical parishes of Bampton Proper, Bampton Lew and Bampton Aston, all now part of the united benefice of Bampton with Clanfield. In 1866 the parish was split into five civil parishes: Bampton, Lew, Aston and Cote, Shifford and Chimney. Anglo-Saxon minster Saint Beornwald of Bampton was venerated as patron saint of Bampton from at least the 9th century until the English Reformation. His feast day was 21 December. Given the degree of local patronage he may have been the founder of the church. Very little is known about Beornwald. Although early records call him saint, confessor, priest and martyr, even his tomb is now lost. His shrine may have been in the north transept of the parish church, where some evidence of a former shrine remains. Bampton Classical Opera gives a concert in the church to celebrate St Beornwald's Day on or close to every 21 December. The Anglo-Saxon church was an important minster serving a large area. The most recognisable traces of that original building are characteristic herringbone masonry in the central crossing tower and stair turret. Norman church After the Norman conquest of England, William the Conqueror granted the church to Leofric, Bishop of Exeter. The Dean and Chapter of Exeter Cathedral have held the advowson of the parish ever since.Crossley & Currie 1996, pages 48‚Äì57 In the 12th century the church was rebuilt on a cruciform plan with north and south transepts. Surviving features from this period include the chancel arch under the tower, a Norman arched doorway in the south wall of the south transept, and a few Norman windows, including in the west walls of both transepts. Gothic enlargements Fred Palmer in 1931 Late in the 13th century the nave was widened by the addition of north and south aisles with four-bay Gothic arcades. Other features from this period include triple sedilia in the chancel, a south chapel adjoining the west side of the south transept and a doorway in the north transept. Early in the 14th century a carved stone reredos was installed in the chancel. It represents Jesus Christ and his 12 apostles, each in a crocketed niche. The west doorway and five-light west window of the nave are also from this period, as is the base of the baptismal font. Late in the 14th century a chapel was added on the north side of the chancel, with an arch from the north transept. In the 15th century clerestories were added to the nave and both transepts, the aisles were re-roofed, an Easter Sepulchre was inserted in the chancel, the embattled south porch was built and parapets and gargoyles were added. Post-Mediaeval architecture In the corner between the chancel and south transept is a memorial chapel for the Horde family. It contains 17th-century monuments and was remodelled in 1702. In 1868‚Äì70 the church was restored under the direction of the architect Ewan Christian. The nave and chancel were re- roofed, Gothic Revival windows were inserted in the north wall of the north transept and south wall of the chancel, and the chancel east window was restored. Burials and monuments In the south transept is a mediaeval recumbent effigy of a lady. In the north chapel is a stone effigy of a knight, said to be Sir Gilbert Talbot, who died in 1419. On a wall in the south transept is a monument to George Thompson, who died in 1603: a recumbent effigy of him flanked by Corinthian columns. In the chancel are three monumental brasses: to Thomas Plymmyswode who died about 1419, Robert Holcot who died in 1500 and Frances Gardner who died in 1633. Bells, clock and chimes The crossing tower has a ring of eight bells. Roger I Purdue of Bristol cast the fifth, sixth and tenor bells in 1629. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast or re-cast the treble, second, third, fourth and seventh bells in 1906. St Mary's has also a Sanctus bell that James Keene of Woodstock cast in 1626. The bells were restored and re-hung in 2006. In 1733 St Mary's Vestry paid ¬£34 to John Reynolds, a blacksmith from Hagbourne, to make a new clock for the tower with a chime to ring the eight bells mechanically. The chime rang a tune on the bells at 9am, 1pm, 5pm and 9pm. The clock has since been replaced with one made by John Smith and Sons of Derby. The chime was long in disrepair and out of use, but after the bells were re- hung a new computer-controlled one was installed that rings a tune on the bells at 1pm and 5pm. Rectory Rectory South of St Mary's is Churchgate House, which used to be the Rectory. The oldest part of the house is 16th- century, with a datestone inscribed \\"1546 Vicar Joan Dotin\\". In 1799 a new Georgian main block was added to the front of the building by the builder and architect Daniel Harris.

It protects four fragments of Atlantic Forest in a region that has lost most of its forest coverage over the last century, and protects the endemic endangered black lion tamarin (), which gives the reserve its name. Location The Mico Le√£o Preto Ecological Station (ESEC) is divided between the municipalities of Euclides da Cunha Paulista (29.99%), Marab√° Paulista (22.88%), Presidente Epit√°cio (10.66%) and Teodoro Sampaio (36.42%) in the state of S√£o Paulo. It is in the extreme west of the state to the north of the Paranapanema River and the Morro do Diabo State Park, and to the south of the Itaipu Dam reservoir on the Paran√° River. The ESEC is divided into four separate fragments of Atlantic Forest: √Ågua Sumida with , Ponte Branca with , Tucano with and Santa Maria with , totalling . The ESEC is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation. History European occupation of the region began in earnest when the Sorocabana Railway reached the Paran√° River in 1917. Urban centers were built along the railway and intensive logging began, followed by farming of coffee, cotton, peanuts and cattle. The state government created the Morro do Diabo Forest Reserve in 1941, now the Morro do Diabo State Park. In 1942 the Great Pontal Reserve and the S√£o Paulo Lagoon Reserve were created. Over the years that followed these two reserves were invaded by squatters and deforested, often with government support. In 1975 the state launched construction of hydroelectric power plants on the Paranapanema and Paran√° Rivers. Employees on these projects squatted on land in the reserves after they were dismissed. However, low fertility of the soil and distance from natural markets has meant that only cattle and sugarcane are profitable, and the region is the poorest in the state of S√£o Paulo. The Mico Le√£o Preto Ecological Station was created by federal decree on 16 July 2002. It is classed as IUCN protected area category Ia (strict nature reserve). Its objective is to protect the remnants of Atlantic Forest in the region, and also to protect the populations of black lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysopygus). This species, whose Portuguese name mico-le√£o-preto is the name of the ESEC, is highly endangered. The ESEC has been part of the Atlantic Forest Biosphere Reserve since November 2002. It would be part of a proposed Trinational Biodiversity Corridor connecting conservation units in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. The boundaries were changed on 14 May 2004. The management plan was published in November 2007. It was approved on 9 September 2008. Fishing regulations were published on 2 October 2008, covering conservation areas and their buffer zones in the Paran√° River basin. They were the Morro do Diabo State Park, Rio do Peixe State Park, Rio Aguape√≠ State Park, Mico-Le√£o-Preto Ecological Station, Ivinhema State Park, Ilha Grande National Park, Caiu√° Ecological Station and Igua√ßu National Park. The consultative council was created on 22 February 2012. In 2015 a program was launched in schools of the municipalities that contain parts of the ESEC to increase awareness of the value of the natural area. In 2016 researchers captured a group of black lion tamarins and gave them GPS collars, providing a new way to monitor the individuals and better understand how they are using the space and responding to fragmentation. Environment Annual rainfall is from , mostly falling in the summer. The K√∂ppen climate classification is Aw - humid tropical savanna climate. Average daily temperatures range from with an average of . There is light frost in some years, and on rare occasions there is heavy frost The terrain is gently rolling, with open valleys and floodplains. Altitudes range from above sea level. The plots that make up the ESEC are on higher land and do not contain large bodies of water. Vegetation is seasonal semideciduous, or Interior Atlantic Forest, with partial loss of leaves during the dry winter months. The forests in the area have been devastated by cattle farming and extraction of valuable wood such as mahogany. The ESEC contains about 10% of the native vegetation remaining in the region. The forests in the ESEC have suffered different levels of disturbance in the past and continue to be influenced by human activity. 169 plant species have been recorded, of which 56 were found in all four plots and 55 in just one plot. The bordering roads are a factor in starting and spreading forest fires. The main crop in the vicinity is sugar cane, which is usually burned at harvest time. The most common threats are incursions of cattle, fires and hunting. Fauna in the Pontal do Paranapanema region include the black lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysopygus), jaguar (Panthera onca), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) and collared peccary (Pecari tajacu). Vulnerable or endangered birds include shrike-like laniisoma (Laniisoma elegans), wing- barred piprites (Piprites chloris), shrike-like tanager (Neothraupis fasciata), bare-throated bellbird (Procnias nudicollis) and solitary tinamou (Tinamus solitarius). Studies and efforts to conserve the black lion tamarins are monitored by the International Committee for the Conservation and Management of Lion Tamarins (ICCM), in which the ESEC participates.

Illinois became the eleventh state in the US to legalize recreational marijuana on January 1, 2020. With the passage of the Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act in 2019, Illinois became the first state in the nation to legalize recreational sales by an act of the state legislature, as previous states had legalized sales by voter initiatives. Vermont legalized recreational use, but not sales, through its legislature. At full maturity, Illinois is expected to generate between $2 to $4 billion in annual revenues from recreational sales. A first in the nation, Illinois will also expunge an estimated 700,000 marijuana-related police records and court convictions in a phased approach forecast to be completed by 2025. Retail sales from recreational cannabis in Illinois average an estimated $40 million in revenue each month since legalization. Since 2014, the Illinois Medical Cannabis Patient Program (MCPP) has also enrolled over 143,000 qualifying patients in the state's medical cannabis and opioid alternative programs across 55 dispensaries offering a lower tax rate when compared to recreational transactions. Retail sales from the medical programs alone have topped nearly $790 million to date. Prohibition (1931) In 1931, Illinois prohibited recreational use of cannabis, as part of a nationwide trend across 29 states in the early 20th century. Cannabis Control Act (1978) Illinois passed the Cannabis Control Act in 1978, which technically allows for medical marijuana. However, in order for it to become an actuality, action was required from two state departments: Human Services and the State Police. Neither department took action. Medical cannabis (2013) The Illinois General Assembly passed the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act in 2013 (MCPP). The law legalizes the use of medical cannabis in tightly controlled circumstances. In August 2013, Governor Patrick Quinn signed into law the state's medical marijuana program, which would take effect on January 1. making it the 20th state to do so. \\"Legally registered patients\\" may, with a prescription from a medical caregiver, apply for an ID card that allows the use of marijuana for medical purposes. The law lists over 30 specific medical conditions that may be legally treated using cannabis, and allows the Department of Public Health to add other conditions to the list via administrative rulemaking. Applications for patients, growers, and vendors began in September 2014.Illinois Department of Agriculture. As of October 2020, the Medical Cannabis Patient Program had significantly grown to over 143,000 qualifying patients participating in the state's medical cannabis and opioid alternative programs. Decriminalization (2016) In July 2016, Illinois reduced punishment for under 10 grams of cannabis to a $100‚Äì200 fine; it was a misdemeanor previously. The law also sets the requirement for DWI at 5 nanograms/ml of THC in the blood. Proposed recreational use (2017) On March 22, 2017, Illinois lawmakers proposed legalizing recreational marijuana in the state. The measure would also allow residents to possess up to 28 grams of cannabis, or about an ounce, and to grow five plants. Early estimates found that legalized marijuana would generate between $350 to $700 million in annual sales. The Chicago Tribune reported legislation was \\"widely expected to pass\\" in 2019, following election of pro-legalization governor JB Pritzker and a favorable state legislature. Medical cannabis expansion (2018-2019) On August 28, 2018, Illinois' medical cannabis program greatly expanded becoming available as an opioid painkiller replacement. The legislation also eased the application process as applicants will no longer have to be fingerprinted or undergo criminal background checks. Some estimate the expansion could bring in up to 365,000 new patients into the medical marijuana program generating an additional $425 million in revenue for the state. On August 12, 2019 Governor J.B. Pritzker signed into law legislation that once again expands Illinois' medical cannabis program and also makes it permanent. The new law adds an additional 11 conditions to the existing program including chronic pain, anorexia nervosa, autism, Irritable bowel syndrome, migraines, osteoarthritis, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Neuro-Behcet's autoimmune disease, neuropathy, polycystic kidney disease, and superior canal dehiscence syndrome. When recreational marijuana becomes legal in January 2020, taxation for medical cannabis products will remain at 1%. Recreational legalization (2019) On May 31, 2019 the Illinois General Assembly passed the Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act to legalize recreational marijuana use starting on January 1, 2020. The bill was signed by Governor J.B. Pritzker on June 25, 2019. Recreational-use revenue in Illinois is expected to reach an estimated $1.6 billion a year. Illinois became the first state in the nation to legalize cannabis for recreational sale through a state legislature rather than ballot initiative. Overall, Illinois is the 11th state in the US to allow recreational marijuana.Illinois becomes 11th state to allow recreational marijuana Associated Press, June 25, 2019 An estimated 700,000 Illinoisans will qualify for the expungement of past marijuana-related convictions. The state, in partnership with the Illinois State Police, expects to fully complete the process by 2025. To date, Illinois was the first state in the nation to include the social equity centric provision. On January 1, 2020, the first day of legal recreational sales, over 77,000 customers spent $3.2 million in legal sales at dispensaries across Illinois. These figures were historic as no other state, Oregon being second, has generated such significant first day recreational sales. Dispensaries saw long lines across the state with customers coming from across the Midwest and nation. On January 6, 2020, Governor Pritzker's office announced that in the first five full days of recreational adult-use sales, 271,169 individual transactions totaled over $10.8 million in sales statewide. Total sales for January 2020 approached $40 million, despite supply shortages. In addition, more than 700 applications were submitted for the second round of newly awarded dispensary licenses, scheduled to be announced on May 1, 2020; over 600 were considered \\"social equity\\" applicants which meet certain criteria to benefit historically disenfranchised communities. Cultivation of Cannabis Under the Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect on January 1, 2020, stipulated that medical marijuana patients could grow up to five plants at a time in their home or on their property. However, recreational users cannot grow marijuana in their home nor on their premises at all. A violation of this stipulation is a civil penalty of 200 dollars. In regards to cultivating cannabis commercially, only Illinois' existing licensed medical marijuana facilities were able to grow the crop initially. However, in 2020 \\"craft growers\\" will be able to apply for licenses to cultivate cannabis for commercial use for no larger than 5,000 square feet of crop.

He designed over 1,100 commercial, residential, and institutional projects in Quebec before and after World WarII. He was noted as the architect of Canada's first shopping centre, the Norgate shopping centre, which opened in Montreal, Quebec in 1949. Early life and education Maxwell Kalman was the fourth child of Romanian immigrants to Montreal. His father, Ozias Kalman, worked as a general contractor. From a young age, Maxwell was enamored by the idea of becoming an architect. He graduated from the Baron Byng High School in 1923 and moved to New York City to take architecture courses at Columbia University by night while doing temporary jobs by day. Returning to Montreal, he enrolled at the McGill University School of Architecture in 1927 and graduated in 1931, one of the first Jewish graduates of McGill‚Äôs architecture school. Career During his term at McGill, he interned at the major architectural firm of Ross and Macdonald. Although they promised to hire him upon graduation, the company was hard hit by the Great Depression and Kalman was forced to start working on his own, beginning in residential construction and renovations. By the mid-1930s he had developed a reputation for efficiency in design space and budget, and was tapped to draw up plans for many commercial, residential, institutional, and community projects. During World WarII he converted a foundry in Joliette into a facility for manufacturing components for \\"training aircraft and merchant-marine submarine detection\\" for the Canadian military. After the war, Kalman partnered with real estate developers while continuing to work for private clients. The postwar years saw him busy designing economically-priced apartments and single-family homes, as well as upscale residential dwellings, to accommodate Montreal's postwar boom. In all, he designed more than 1,100 commercial, residential, and institutional projects. Notable designs Kalman is noted as the architect of Canada's first shopping centre, the Norgate shopping centre, in Saint-Laurent (1949), which was created to service residents of the larger Norgate housing complex, which Kalman also designed. The L-shaped mall and outdoor parking lot featured a line of small stores anchored by several large anchor stores that would draw in business. Kalman's architectural and marketing concept was subsequently applied to the first shopping centre in Ottawa, the Westgate Shopping Centre, and other Montreal commercial centres. The Norgate housing complex was the first project invested in by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) under the National Housing Act. Kalman also designed the Montreal suburb of Lorraine for the CMHC. Other notable projects in Montreal include the art deco-inspired Workmen's Circle Centre (today the Sala Rossa), the Jewish People's School (today the College Fran√ßais), and the Shelbourne Towers apartment complex (now Appartements Belfort). A number of his residential projects in Montreal have been added to the province's R√©pertoire du patrimoine culturel du Qu√©bec, including Tudor Revival properties located at 2825‚Äì2827 and 2789‚Äì2797 Willowdale Avenue. Centennial retrospective In honor of Kalman's 100th birthday on May 30, 2006, McGill University and the University of Montreal presented a retrospective of his architectural work from the 1930s through early 1960s, together with a recorded interview with the architect. The exhibition traveled to C√¥te-Saint-Luc for another public viewing from January 30 to May 31, 2007. Philanthropy Kalman fund-raised for State of Israel Bonds, the United Jewish Appeal, and Congregation Shaar Hashomayim. He also supported McGill University and the Technion School of Architecture, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Weizmann Institute of Science, and Bar-Ilan University in Israel. Personal life Kalman married twice and had two sons, Lawrence and Harold; Harold D. Kalman is an architectural historian and author in Vancouver, British Columbia. Kalman died of pneumonia on November 27, 2009, in Montreal, aged 103. He was buried at the New Jewish Cemetery in Ottawa.

The band consists of drummer Robby Staebler, vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Charles Michael Parks Jr., and guitarist Ben McLeod. History= Formation and early years (2012-2015)  All Them Witches first formed on January 6, 2012. Drummer Robby Staebler had recently moved to Nashville from Portland, looking for musicians to start a band. Staebler recruited guitarist Ben McLeod after meeting him at a bar, followed by front-man and bassist Charles Michael Parks Jr. while they were both working for \\"a corporate hippie store.\\" The band's name is taken from a book of witchcraft, All of Them Witches, featured in the 1968 film Rosemary's Baby. The band self-released their first, self-titled four track EP in the same year as their formation. They then became the first American band to be signed to the German heavy psych record label, Elektrohasch Schallplatten. Their debut album, Our Mother Electricity (which had previously been self-released by the band in summer 2012), was released on Elektrohasch with new mastering and new artwork (by Mat Bethancourt) in February 2013. Soon after came their second EP, Extra Pleasant, which was recorded with two microphones directly to a 4 track cassette tape recorder. In 2013, the band's second studio album, Lightning at the Door, was self-released via their own Bandcamp page; however, it was later marketed by Tone Tree Music. Their next self-released album was the official live album At The Garage in February 2015.  New West Records (2015-present)  In summer 2015, the band signed to New West Records. Later in the year, they released their third studio album (and their first with New West), Dying Surfer Meets His Maker, which was recorded in six days in a remote mountainside cabin, overlooking Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. The album's name was originally used by McLeod for a song in his solo project, Woodsplitter, inspired by a real-life incident where he almost died when surfing. The band's previously self- released album, Lightning at the Door, was then re-released by New West in 2016. This was followed first by Live In Brussels (recorded live in Brussels, Belgium in March 2016) in September 2016, then by the band's fourth studio album, Sleeping Through the War in February 2017. Sleeping Through the War was produced by Nashville's Dave Cobb, who had worked previously with artists such as Sturgill Simpson and Chris Stapleton. The album featured guest vocals from three Nashville-based female vocalists: Caitlin Rose, Erin Rae, and Tristen, in addition to harmonica contributions from Mickey Raphael. In mid-2018 it was announced that Jonathan Draper was replacing Allan Van Cleave on keyboards. In an interview at Download Festival 2018, Parks and Staebler made clear that the change was permanent, and that Van Cleave had left the band. Their next album, ATW, was released in September of that year; however, the following month, Parks announced that the band would be continuing as a three piece, without Draper. ATW was produced by the band's guitarist, Ben McLeod, and mixed by producer Rob Schnapf, featuring a more simplified, naturalistic sound than their previous albums. The band's first music as a three piece was the non- album single \\"1X1\\", released on Halloween 2019. This was followed by their sixth studio album, Nothing as the Ideal, in September 2020. The album was recorded at Abbey Road Studios (in Studio Two, as previously used by The Beatles and Pink Floyd) and produced by Mikey Allred, who had also produced their earlier album, Dying Surfer Meets His Maker. Shortly before the album's release, in mid-August, a video was released for the track \\"The Children of Coyote Woman\\". The video was directed by drummer, Robby Staebler, and starred Staebler alongside professional skateboarder Evan Smith.  Musical style and influences  The band's musical style incorporates elements from multiple genres, such as hard rock, stoner rock, psychedelia, neo-psychedelia, blues, folk, and southern rock; however, Julian Marszalek of The Quietus noted that: > \\"...this isn‚Äôt blues of the ‚Äúwoke-up-this-morning‚Äù variety but one of > malaise, anxiety and fear brought on a by world seemingly dead set on > destruction; nor is this an escapist variant of psychedelia wherein one form > of reality is jettisoned in favour of another for reasons of cheap thrills.\\" Nick Pipitone of Monster Riff described how the band are \\"influenced just as much by Dr. John and Mississippi bluesman Junior Kimbrough as they are by Black Sabbath and progressive metal\\" and that their music can \\"venture from bluesy riffs and folk tales to spacey neo-psychedelic to punishing doom rock.\\" Similarly, Rob Hughes of Classic Rock Magazine noted how \\"[All Them Witches are] as likely to create boiling riptides of bluesy psychedelia as they are pools of mystic folk and doomy ambience.\\" Vocalist and bassist, Charles Michael Parks Jr., who is also the band's lyricist, has described international folk music as one of his biggest influences, and cited Pink Floyd, Grateful Dead, the Allman Brothers, (early) Fleetwood Mac, and Roy Buchanan as artists of which all band members are fans. Guitarist, Ben McLeod additionally cites Jerry Garcia and The Doors as significant influences, beginning in his childhood. All Them Witches are commonly compared with Black Sabbath; however, Parks has described this as misleading, because none of the band members listen to Sabbath. Other groups against which the band have been compared include Kyuss, Blue Cheer, Tool, Queens of the Stone Age, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin.

Biography Little appears to be known of Cooper apart from her publications, and a few reviews and commentaries relating to them; she appears to have been unmarried, at least during the period in which she was published. In 1865 she published A Popular History of America, subtitled From the Discovery by Columbus to the Establishment of the Federal Republic of the United States In Three Periods: I. The Discovery and Conquest of the West Indies and South America II. The Colonization of the United States III. The War of Independence and the Establishment of the Federal Government. The history, covering both the north and south of the continent, runs to 527 pages and includes two fold-out maps. In the following year, 1866, she published a two-volume The Life and Letters of Lady Arabella Stuart, based on her studies of Stuart-related papers held by Thomas Phillipps, Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton, George Digby Wingfield Digby and others. The Westminster and Foreign Quarterly Review described the work as a carefully painted portrait, built on 'numerous original and hitherto unpublished documents', and written with 'quiet taste and sober treatment'. She next published The Life of Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Stafford in 1874; the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography speculates that the gap between this and the Arabella Stuart might arise out of illness; her dedication in Stafford is to Edward Lane, a medical doctor and hydrotherapist who ran establishments at Moor Park, Farnham and Sudbrook Park, Petersham; Cooper evidently believed he had rescued her from certain death. The two-volume Stafford was the first scholarly treatise on Wentworth, and was received with generally good reviews.

Possession is permitted only for medical use, but no longer a criminal infraction as of January 2020. A popular Hawaiian language term for cannabis is pakalolo (crazy tobacco), and the term appears in the Hawaiian newspaper Ka Nonanona as early as 1842. Hawaii is famous for its cannabis, with many strains developed locally. Medical cannabis (2000) In 2000, Hawaiian governor Ben Cayetano signed into law Act 228, allowing medical marijuana cardholders to grow their own cannabis or appoint a caretaker to do so. However, the law did not establish any legal market or dispensaries. Dispensary program (2015) In 2015, the Medical Marijuana Dispensary Program of Hawaii was created to require those who qualify for medical marijuana to register before using marijuana for medical purposes.(health.hawaii.gov) To register, you must have a licensed physician certifying that the patient‚Äôs health condition can be benefited from medical marijuana. The patient will then receive a 329 Registration Card issued by the Department of Health. The goal of the Department of Health for issuing the 329 Registration Card is to issue it in a timely manner so that patients can continue or start to use medical marijuana legally. In July 2015, The Act 241 was passed. It states that the Hawaii Department of Health will administer the Medical Marijuana Dispensary Program by 2016 and dispensaries can begin to dispense medical and manufactured marijuana products as early as July 2016 assuming that the Department of Health grants approval to these dispensaries. To address legal acquisition of cannabis, in 2016 Senate Bill 321 established a dispensary system, allowing eight dispensaries in the state, designated by island. In August 2017, the first legal medical cannabis dispensary sale was made in Maui.Hawaii‚Äôs first legal marijuana sale takes place on Maui Industrial hemp (2016) In July 2016, Governor David Ige signed Act 228, creating a pilot program allowing the Hawaii Department of Agriculture to oversee the cultivation of industrial hemp for agricultural or academic research. In February 2017, the Hawaii House of Representatives Agricultural Committee passed legislation to remove criminal or civil sanctions for the \\"planting, growing, harvesting, possessing, processing, selling, or buying\\" of industrial hemp. Decriminalization Bill (2020) On July 1, 2019, Governor Ige announced that he would let a legislature-passed bill to decriminalize small amounts of cannabis become law without him actually signing it. Beginning on January 11, 2020, this bill made possession of three grams or less of marijuana punishable by a $130 fine. Under the former law, possessing even a tiny amount of cannabis was punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a fine of up to $1,000.

A bill to legalize recreational use passed the House in March 2019. Medical use was legalized in 2007 through a bill signed by Governor Bill Richardson. A 1978 law also allowed for medical use but only through a federally-approved research program. It was the first medical cannabis law enacted by any state.  State policy =Prohibition (1923) In 1923, New Mexico banned the cultivation, importation, and sale of cannabis. The Santa Fe New Mexican noted:Marihuana, A Signal of Misunderstanding. The Report of the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse. Commissioned by President Richard M. Nixon, March, 1972 Controlled Substances Therapeutic Research Act (1978) In 1978 New Mexico became the first state to pass legislation allowing the medical use of cannabis in some form. Known as the Controlled Substances Therapeutic Research Act, the bill allowed the use of cannabis through a research program approved by the Food and Drug Administration, using cannabis supplied by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The bill was spurred by the efforts of cancer patient Lynn Pierson, who found relief from using cannabis and pleaded his case to state lawmakers that he should be allowed to use the drug. His efforts were rewarded in February 1978 when the bill was signed into law, following its passage in both chambers of the legislature by wide margins. However, the program still required federal approval, which would not come until August 1978, shortly after Pierson died due to his illness. The approval was then rescinded a few weeks later, but in November 1978 the final go-ahead was given, and cannabis was delivered to the state two months later. Between 1978 and 1986, approximately 250 cancer patients received either cannabis or THC through the Lynn Pierson Therapeutic Research Program (named in honor of Pierson after his death). Governor Johnson endorses legalization (1999) In 1999, Republican Governor Gary Johnson set off a political firestorm in the state when he endorsed the policy of drug legalization. In particular, Johnson called for the legalization of cannabis and said that the drug's dangers had been significantly exaggerated. His comments regarding legalization were soon condemned by various law enforcement officials, the lieutenant governor, and the Republican Party. Darren White, the secretary of the New Mexico Department of Public Safety, resigned in protest. Drug czar Barry McCaffrey even made a special trip to Albuquerque to denounce the governor's comments which he called \\"astonishing and embarrassing\\". Johnson did not back down, however, and continued to advocate for legalization as he finished out his second term. He became the highest-ranking elected official in the country to endorse such a position. Medical use legalized (2007) In April 2007, Governor Bill Richardson signed into law Senate Bill 523, the \\"Lynn and Erin Compassionate Use Act\\". The bill allowed the use of cannabis with a physician's recommendation for treatment of certain medical conditions such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and some spinal-cord injuries. In later years the list of qualifying conditions was expanded, and an allowance for cultivation by patients was added as well. Senate Bill 523 passed the Senate by a vote of 32‚Äì3 and the House by a vote of 36‚Äì31, making New Mexico the 12th state to legalize medical use and the 4th to do so through an act of state legislature. House approves legalization (2019) In March 2019 the New Mexico House of Representatives voted 36‚Äì34 to pass a recreational legalization bill (House Bill 356), the first time that either chamber of the legislature had approved such a measure. The bill then stalled in the Senate Finance Committee, but Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham announced that she would add the issue to the legislative agenda for the upcoming year. Decriminalization (2019) In April 2019, Governor Lujan Grisham signed into law Senate Bill 323. The bill made first-time possession of up to a half ounce a petty misdemeanor offense, punishable by a $50 fine. It also decriminalized possession of drug paraphernalia, making New Mexico the first state to do so. SB 323 passed the House by a 44‚Äì20 vote and the Senate 30‚Äì8. It went into effect on July 1, 2019. Cannabis Legalization Working Group (2019) In June 2019, Governor Lujan Grisham announced the formation of the Cannabis Legalization Working Group to determine the best path forward for legalization during the 2020 legislative session. Said Grisham: \\"This group will ensure we begin the next session with a credible, equitable, and cohesive legalization proposal that will incorporate all public safety concerns, workplace regulations, labeling requirements that protect underage children, and all manner of other issues.\\" The working group consists of over 20 individuals from varying backgrounds including state lawmakers, cabinet secretaries, law enforcement officials, and medical cannabis executives. The Cannabis Legalization Working Group released a report detailing its recommendations in October 2019. \\"Through more than 30 hours of public meetings across the state, and with the help of more than 200 pages of public comment, the members explored every aspect of legalization, both good and bad,\\" said the chair of the working group, Albuquerque City Councilor Pat Davis. County and municipal policy=Santa Fe decriminalization (2014) In August 2014, Santa Fe City Council voted 5‚Äì4 to enact (rather than let go to ballot) a citizen-led petition to decriminalize small amounts of cannabis. The law allows police to issue a $25 civil citation for possession of up to an ounce, and requires that minor cannabis offenses be made the lowest police priority. Bernalillo and Santa Fe county referendums (2014) In November 2014, voters in Bernalillo and Santa Fe counties approved (with 60% and 73% of the vote) ballot measures expressing support for \\"county, city, and statewide efforts to decriminalize possession of one ounce or less of marijuana\\". Initially the referendums were blocked from appearing on the ballot by Secretary of State Dianna Duran (who claimed that state law did not allow for non-binding questions), but the Supreme Court of New Mexico overruled her in September 2014. Albuquerque decriminalization (2018) In April 2018, Albuquerque City Council voted 5‚Äì4 to allow police to issue a $25 civil citation for possessing up to an ounce of cannabis. Previous efforts to decriminalize through a city council vote (in 2015) and a ballot measure vote (in 2014) were vetoed by the prior mayor Richard Berry. Santa Fe legalization resolution (2018) In December 2018, Santa Fe City Council approved a resolution calling on state lawmakers to \\"enact legislation related to the legalization ... of cannabis and cannabis-related products for recreational use\\". The resolution was introduced by Mayor Alan Webber and passed by a 6‚Äì1 vote. Las Cruces legalization resolution (2020) In February 2020, Las Cruces City Council approved a resolution urging the state legislature to pass the Cannabis Regulation Act to legalize recreational cannabis in New Mexico. The resolution passed 6‚Äì1 with Mayor Ken Miyagishima casting the only opposing vote.

Efforts at legalization during the 2018-2019 legislative session were unsuccessful. Nonetheless, as of August 2019, New Jersey lawmakers have once again confirmed that legislation progress is ‚Äúalive and well,‚Äù most prominently that Governor Phil Murphy ‚Äúis all for‚Äù before the end of 2019. However, on December 16, 2019, state legislature passed a cannabis referendum bill, putting it on the 2020 ballot for voters. Criminalization In 2013, New Jersey police made 24,765 arrests for possession of small amounts of marijuana, the highest in two decades. The number of 2013 arrests was double that of 1993, when the state's population was smaller. The spike in arrest rates was at odds with the national trend, beginning in 2007, that saw a decline in arrests for marijuana possession.Jan Hefler, Bucking National Trend, New Jersey Is Arresting More People for Marijuana, Tribune News Service (November 23, 2015). New Jersey arrested 34,500 people on cannabis offenses in 2017, more than any other state in the nation. The maximum penalty for simple possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana is six months in jail and a fine. Few first-time offenders serve jail time. Cannabis reform advocacy New Jersey United for Marijuana Reform is an advocacy coalition of \\"religious, civil rights, law enforcement and medical leaders\\" who support legalization of marijuana in the state.Susan K. Livio, Why this election could help pave way for legal marijuana in N.J., nation, NJ.com (November 3, 2016). A report by New Jersey United for Marijuana Reform and New Jersey Policy Perspective, issued in 2016, concluded that if New Jersey legalized marijuana, it could generate about $300 million a year in sales tax revenue for the state. (The report assumed a sales tax of 25% and annual in-state marijuana sales of $1.2 billion.)Susan K. Livio, Legalizing marijuana would reap $300M a year in taxes for N.J., advocates say, NJ.com (May 23, 2016).

Since the 1990s, Forchion has agitated for marijuana-law reform in the state. In 2004, Forchion lost a bid to legally change his name to \\"NJ Weedman\\" after prosecutors intervened. Forchion has been convicted of violating New Jersey's marijuana laws several times; in 2015, the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, affirmed one of his convictions, rejecting Forchion's contention that the criminalization of marijuana violated his constitutional rights under the state and federal constitutions.MaryAnn Spoto, NJ Weedman taking marijuana conviction to high court, NJ.com (August 8, 2015). Public opinion In 2015, Rutgers Eagleton Institute of Politics conducted a public opinion poll of New Jerseyans, asking whether they supported legalizing, taxing, and regulating the use of marijuana.

Medical cannabis On January 18, 2010, amidst a \\"flurry of bills\\" he signed on his final day in office, outgoing governor Jon Corzine signed into law S. 119, the Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act, permitting the use of medical cannabis for persons with listed conditions: cancer, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, seizure disorder, Lou Gerhig's disease, severe muscle spasms, muscular dystrophy, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease and any terminal illness (defined as an illness for which a physician certifies that the patient will die within one year). The law allows the New Jersey health department to create rules to add other illnesses to the list. The law does not allow patients to grow their own marijuana; instead, the plant must be acquired through \\"alternate treatment centers\\" licensed by the state. Caregivers for patients are permitted to collect marijuana on behalf of the patient, but the caregiver must be designated and cleared by a criminal background check. Enrollment in the medical marijuana program is small, which has been attributed to costs, the rigid limitations of the program, and \\"the small number of doctors willing to recommend patients,\\" as well as resistance to the program by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who in 2014 called the medical program a \\"front for legalization\\" of marijuana.Brent Johnson, Christie says medical marijuana programs are 'a front for legalization', NJ.com (June 17, 2014). In 2011, New Jersey was described as having the strictest medical marijuana law among the 16 states that at the time permitted medical marijuana.Richard P√©rez-Pe√±a, Marijuana for Patients May Proceed, Christie Says, New Jersey Times (July 19, 2011). In 2013, the parents of a two-year-old with Dravet's syndrome confronted Christie, who signed a bill allowing access for sick children to medical marijuana in what was later dubbed the \\"pot for tots\\" controversy. As of 2015, 5,540 patients were registered as part of the program, along with 355 caregivers authorized to buy on behalf of ill patients.Susan K.

Under New Jersey's medical-marijuana law, up to a maximum of six alternate treatment centers receive contracts from the state. These centers, which must be nonprofit, have the exclusive right to produce and sell medical marijuana in New Jersey.

Livio, Christie to let PTSD sufferers get medical marijuana, NJ.com (September 14, 2016). In 2017, the state Medicinal Marijuana Review Panel, in a 5‚Äì1 vote, recommended that a number of conditions be added to the list of medical marijuana-qualifying conditions in New Jersey, including migraines, Tourette syndrome, autism- related anxiety, and Alzheimer's disease-related anxiety, as well as chronic pain if \\"related to a broad range of ailments, including opioid use disorder, arthritis, back and neck pain, sciatica, diabetes, surgeries, injuries, neuropathy, Lyme disease, lupus, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, pancreatitis, and others.\\" However, the Review Panel rejected proposals to add asthma and chronic fatigue to the list. The final determination on additions to the list is made by the state Health Commissioner. 2017‚Äì2019 unsuccessful proposals on legalization and regulation of recreational marijuana and expansion of medically used marijuana In May 2017, state Senator Nicholas Scutari, a Democrat from Union, introduced legislation to legalize marijuana in New Jersey for recreational purposes.S.P. Sullivan, Here's N.J. lawmaker's plan to legalize recreational marijuana after Christie leaves, NJ Advance Media for NJ.com (May 15, 2017).Janice Williams, Recreational Marijuana Coming to New Jersey? Lawmaker Introduces Legislation to Legalize Pot, Newsweek (May 20, 2017). Under Scutari's proposal, adults aged 21 and over in the state would be able to legally consume marijuana and to legally possess up to one ounce of marijuana flower, plus 16 ounces of solid cannabis-infused products (i.e., edibles); 72 ounces of \\"liquid marijuana tinctures, drinks and oils,\\" and seven grams of marijuana concentrate. A state sales tax on marijuana products would go from 7% in the first year to 10% in the second year, progressively rising by 5% per year until the tax level reached 25%. \\"Unlike all of the eight states that already host recreational marijuana programs, New Jersey would not allow home cultivation.\\" Christie strongly opposed any legalization of marijuana, calling the legislation \\"beyond stupidity\\" and \\"nothing more than crazy liberals who want to say everything's OK,\\"Brent Johnson, Christie hammers backers of legalizing marijuana in N.J., calls it 'beyond stupidity', NJ Advance Media for NJ.com (May 3, 2017). and said that he would veto any legalization bill.Jan Hefler, Legalized pot in New Jersey - not so fast, Philadelphia Inquirer (March 9, 2018).

Scutari introduced new legislation to legalize, regulate, and tax marijuana for recreational purposes, the New Jersey Marijuana Legalization Act, on June 7, 2018. Stephen M. Sweeney is a consponsor.New Jersey Marijuana Legalization Act (S. 2703), 218th New Jersey LEgislature, introduce June 7, 2018. In November 2018, a joint panel of the New Jersey Legislature (composed of assembly members and senators) passed S-2703, as well as separate legislation to expand access to medical marijuana (S-10) and to expand the state's expungement process, including for drug offenses (S-3205).Mike Davis & Nicholas Pugliese, NJ marijuana legalization clears first hurdle after legal weed vote, Asbury Park Press' (November 26, 2018). Under S-2703, the possession of up to 1 ounce of marijuana, and the consumption of marijuana in the home or designated areas would be become legal; a 12% state sales tax on marijuana would be imposed; and New Jersey municipalities would be given the power to choose to levy an additional 2% tax. Under S-10, edible forms of marijuana would be legalized for adult medical use; patients enrolled in New Jersey's medical marijuana program could possess up to 3 ounces (an increase from two ounces); and the permitting process for medical marijuana dispensaries, manufacturers, and cultivators would be expedited. The progress of the legalization bill was slowed by legislative gridlock.Nick Corasaniti, You Want Snacks With That? New Jersey Bill Considers Marijuana Delivery, New York Times (December 14, 2018). Governor Murphy and Senate President Sweeney agreed that marijuana should be legalized, but disagree on details.Nick Corasaniti, How a Push to Legalize Pot in N.J. Became a Debate on Race and Fairness, New York Times (November 28, 2018).

Senator Ronald Rice was a leading opponent of legalization. As a result of their opposition, the proponents of the legislation needed every other Senate Democrat, and possibly several Senate Republicans, in order to secure passage. Negotiations in December 2018 and January 2019 focused on the tax rate for marijuana sales and regulatory oversight.Brent Johnson, Legalizing weed and raising N.J. minimum wage to be hashed out again in meeting between Murphy and top Dems, NJ Advance Media for NJ.com (January 3, 2019). In March 2019, the effort to legalize marijuana in New Jersey collapsed, as Murphy and Sweeney were unable to persuade a majority of senators to back the legislation. 2020 referendum After the collapse of the 2018-19 efforts to legalize marijuana through the legislature, legislative leaders announced plans to place a marijuana referendum on the 2020 ballot. In New Jersey, a referendum can be placed on the ballot when the legislature votes to do so by a simple majority in two consecutive years, or a supermajority (60% in both houses) in one year.Ryan Hutchins, Katherine Landergan & Sam Sutton, Legal pot bill dead: New Jersey lawmakers to move ahead with 2020 referendum, Politico (May 15, 2019).Dustin Racioppi, NJ legal weed vote pushed back to 2020, and this time voters will decide, NorthJersey.com (May 15, 2019).

It passed in the Assembly by a vote of 49‚Äì24 (with one abstention) and in the Senate by a vote of 24‚Äì16. Local restrictions Although a legalization bill did not pass the state legislature in 2018, a number of municipal governments in New Jersey nevertheless enacted legislation in anticipation of legalization that would ban or restrict marijuana sales and use within those municipalities, including Freehold Township, Oceanport, Cinnaminson Township, Hazlet, Middletown Township, Brick, and Toms River.Steph Solis, NJ marijuana legalization: Freehold Township bans weed sales, Asbury Park Press (October 10, 2018).

It was filmed in 1955 and released in 1957. It starred Dolores del R√≠o based in the same name play by Jacinto Benavente. Plot The story is about the marriage between Feliciano (Jose Suarez) and Dominica (Dolores del Rio), owners of a ranch. They have years of marriage, and Dominica has not been able to conceive any children. Feliciano has a reputation as a womanizer and he fathered many illegitimate children. It is implied that his infidelity due to the inability of his wife to give him a son. Dominica defends her husband in public, but reproaches him in private. But she never deviates from her commitment to love him until death. In the house also lives Maria Juana (Mar√≠a Luz Galicia), younger sister of Dominica. A very strong sexual tension occurs between her and Feliciano. The film presents a clear contrast between Dominica, a woman of spirit, and Maria Juana, a woman of flesh. It is decided by her family that Mar√≠a Juana must marry the brother of Feliciano, Jos√©. Mar√≠a Juana is not in love with Jos√© and reluctantly agrees. It is therefore not a love triangle but a rectangle consisting of Feliciano, Dominica, Mar√≠a Juana and Jos√©. Cast * Dolores del R√≠o - as Dominica * Jos√© Su√°rez - as Feliciano * Mar√≠a Luz Galicia - as Mar√≠a Juana * Manuel Monroy - as Jos√© Comments It suggested a comparison between the film and another taken from the work of Jacinto Benavente, The Unloved Woman. This is not bad but lacks the ferocity, simplicity and perversity of the feelings of the other. The oppressive claustrophobia of the ranch house of The Unloved Woman is missing. The script does not extract everything possible from the situation.

Delaware Division of Public Health data on patients who received marijuana cards in 2015, should that the primary medical condition being treated for cardholders was pain (36.3%), muscle spasms (21.6%), and cancer (9.3%). The first medical marijuana clinic in Delaware opened in Wilmington in June 2015. As of that date, some 340 Delaware residents held cards from the Delaware Health and Social Services, allowing them to purchase marijuana in order to treat their medical conditions. However, as of 2016, medical- marijuana cardholders still struggled to obtain the drug, with many being forced to pay very high prices, to buy the drug on the street, or to drive very long distances to obtain the drug. The medical marijuana legislation provided that all three of the state's counties -- New Castle, Kent, and Sussex -- must have a Compassion Center by January 1, 2013. However, only a single facility (the Wilmington facility in New Castle County) has opened as of 2016. Decriminalization (2015) In June 2015, Governor Markell signed legislation decriminalizing the possession of one ounce or less of marijuana by adults. Possession of marijuana remains a civil infraction that carries a $100 fine. The bill passed along party lines, with no Republican member of the House or Senate voting in support of the bill. Under the legislation, it remains illegal for minors (persons under age 21) to possess marijuana.Marijuana Decriminalization Law Takes Effect in Delaware, Associated Press (December 18, 2015). Additionally, smoking marijuana \\"in a moving vehicle, in public areas, or outdoors on private property within 10 feet of a street, sidewalk or other area accessible to the public\\" is also a misdemeanor. The decriminalization bill took effect in December 2015.

Burns was found guilty of the murder of Michael Quinlivan near Wickliffe. Burns was believed to have been responsible for seven other murders in colonies of Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. Early life Robert Francis Burns was born in Limerick, Ireland in 1840. In 1862 he was found guilty of stealing and sentenced to ten years and transportation. He arrived in Western Australia in 1862. He later emigrated to the colony of Victoria lured by the gold rush. By the mid-1870s, he was working as a farm labourer before turning to crime. He would often befriend a fellow worker before convincing them to withdraw their life savings before killing them. Sometimes he would give his intended victim poison or hard liquor to lower their defences. His favourite method of killing was to hit his victim in the head with a hard object, either hammer or tomahawk. The bodies of the victims were often found naked and had their heads hacked off. Murder On 1 July 1880, the body of an unknown man was found in the bush near Wickliffe in Victoria Australia, the top of his skull having been smashed in by a blow from a hammer. The remains were buried without being identified, the clothes and an empty purse found alongside the body remaining in the possession of constable McCracken. When Robert Francis Burns was charged with the murder of Charles Forbes at Deep Lead, McCracken recollected a man answering his description and was later able to identify the murdered man as being Michael Quinlivan, who had been robbed of a sum of ¬£80. Burns and Quinlivan had been working at Reedy Creek, near Wickliffe. Burns had induced Quinlivan to withdraw the money at Dunkeld, and several days later Quinlivan was not to be found. Burns was acquitted over Forbes's death and immediately re-arrested and charged with the murder of Michael Quinlivan. Burns was convicted and sentenced to death on 23 July 1883. Confession Burns while being pinioned for his execution confessed to Upjohn the executioner that he was responsible for eight murders. = Probable victims= Burns victims are believed to be: * John Scott ‚Äì 12 March 1876 at Tarnagulla, Victoria - his skull fractured by a hammer. * Richard Going ‚Äì 6 December 1877 at Berlin, Victoria ‚Äì his remains were found in his burnt out hut, his skull had been fractured. * Burns‚Äô brother-in-law ‚Äì Early 1879 at Penshurst, Victoria disappeared and Burns was flush with cash. * Unknown male - 26 August 1879 at Wagga Wagga - headless body found in reserve near Wagga Wagga. * Unknown male ‚Äì Early 1880 at Gerogery, New South Wales believed to have been working with Burns as a contractor. * Michael Quinlivan - July 1880 at Wickliffe, Victoria - Burns found guilty of murder and hanged. * Francis Heenan ‚Äì late 1880 at Burra, South Australia ‚Äì believed to have been poisoned. * Charles Forbes - 10 December 1881 at Deep Lead, Victoria ‚Äì headless, naked body found near mineshaft. Burns was acquitted due to lack of evidence.

The reserve stretches around the north, east, and south of Lop Nur, a dry lake in a desert known as the \\"Sea of Death\\", and one of the most arid regions in the world. The reserve was established in 1986 by Xinjiang Province, and has been modified over the years. The reserve is under pressure from new roads in the area, development of mining interests, and illegal hunting. The area was formerly used as China's nuclear test site. The nuclear testing caused no apparent ill effects on the camels, which continued to breed normally. After China signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996, the camels were reclassified as an endangered species. Since then, human incursions into the area have caused a sharp drop in the camel population. Topography The reserve is situated in an uninhabited, arid desert of mountains and valleys. The Tarim Basin is to the west, the Altyn-Tagh mountains form a southern barrier, and the Karum Tagh range (an extension of the Tien Shan) mountains are to the north. A corridor of sand dunes run north- south on the eastern edge of the site, protecting the camels from eastern influences, as does the dry lake bed of Lop Nur to the west. The Altun Shan National Nature Reserve borders Lop Nur to the southwest. Climate and ecoregion The climate of the reserve has been described as \\"hostile\\". Extreme aridity, extreme heat in summer, extreme cold in winter, and abrasive sandstorms create an environment that few plants or animals are adapted to survive. The climate classification is Cold desert climate\\" (K√∂ppen climate classification \\"BWk\\" ). Parts of the area receive an average of only 10‚Äì20 mm of precipitation per year, with an average 4,000 mm/year evaporation. The Lop Nur Reserve is in the east of the Taklamakan Desert ecoregion. Because this region is surrounded by mountains, it is cut off from the Asian monsoon and from Arctic air masses. The result is one of the driest place on earth. Flora and fauna Due to the aridity and salinity of the soil, vegetation cover is sparse, varying from 6% in the Kuruk Tagh mountains, up to 30% on flood plains of the Airgin mountains in the south. Halophytes predominate. The north slope of the Arjin Mountains in the south, and the Aqike Valley below, have more vegetation cover and provide the best habitat for the wild camels. The wild camel population of the reserve was estimated at 638 in 2013. Virtually all of them are found in the southeastern third of the area, although they do roam outside the boundaries. The Aqike Valley appears to be the prime breeding ground, as it benefits from more extensive vegetation, snow melt from the mountains, and an underground water table that approaches 2 meters from the surface. The camels have adapted to drinking the salt water of the desert. Stuffed Wild Bactrian Camel Reserve management In recent years, professional management has been brought to the reserve, with patrols and guard checkpoints, scientific surveys, public education initiatives, and has channeled water from the mountains to prime breeding areas. The population of wild camels appears to be recovering. Poaching is recorded as on the decline, and there are no domesticated camels in the reserve.

Its original purpose was to provide to the general public a medium for displaying the military aviation heritage of North Queensland through artefacts, photographic displays and memorabilia. Initially, the Museum was under the direction of RAAF Museum Point Cook and was open to the public once a month. The Heritage Centre displays a variety of uniforms, insignia, medical supplies, training materials, weaponry, rations and many models of airplanes. Some unusual artefacts include a pack of study cards schools the student in Survival of Atomic Attack and Silhouette cards teach ship identification from the air. Some unopened medical supplies from the 1940s complete with written instructions are also featured.  Opening  The Museum was officially opened on 10 June 1983 by the Air Officer Commanding Operational Command Air Vice Marshal Russell Law.  1990s  The main gate to the RAAF base was closed in 1991, allowing the creation of a new museum facility. In 1992, the Museum's opening hours were expanded to every Sunday, instead of a single day. The major drawcard at the time was a P-51 Mustang that was undergoing restoration. 1992 saw Townsville experience its first fifty-year event after World War II, the 50th Anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea. The Museum produced a display of the battle and the areas of the Pacific in which the battle was played out. In 1995, the 50th Anniversary of Victory in the Pacific (VP50) was a second, larger, event celebrated by Townsville. The volunteer staff of the Museum, lacking direction and support, provided the best displays they could, diligently displaying everything. Unfortunately, negative comments from the public regarding the tiredness of the facilities lead to the temporary closure of the Museum from September 1997 to August 1999. Initially, the closure was to be final, however, through the application of a new curatorial direction, hard work and a variety of new ideas and fresh displays via dedicated volunteer staff, the Museum was granted a reprieve. In 2000, official notification was received that directed the Museum to close on 30 November, though this direction was averted at the last minute and the work of Museum continued.  2000s  The early part of the 21st century proved to be a period of growth for the Museum. Opening hours were expanded again to Tuesday and Thursday mornings and Sundays. The Museum produced a photographic display on East Timor which was opened by Brigadier Mark Evans, DSC, AM on 18 August. The display offered Townsville residents glimpses of the area of the conflict in which many local residents had been involved. 2001: The Museum received high commendations from the North Queensland Tourism Awards in both 2001 and 2002. 2003: The Museum won the Heritage and Cultural category of the North Queensland Tourism Awards. On 17 December, the Museum celebrated the 100th Anniversary of powered flight by the Wright brothers. Linked to that celebration was the 100th anniversary of Townsville being declared a city. 2005: On 1 January, the Museum became incorporated and the North Queensland Military Aviation Museum Inc, trading as RAAF Townsville Museum was established. 2007: Via funding through the Department of Veteran Affairs, the Museum established a Vietnam display in August. This addition was formally opened by Charles 'Bud' Tingwell, OA. The Museum also opened the Owen 'Wheels' Wheeler Memorial Transport display, a dedicated volunteer for the Museum who dedicated much of his life to military transport. This display consists of a Chevrolet Blitz C30 truck that had been restored with the help of local businesses and volunteers. Extra assistance was given through the Federal Government's 'Work for the Dole' program. Peter Lindsay, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Defence, presented an award to the Museum on behalf of the Prime Minister in August.  Notable outdoor exhibits  * A de Haviland Vampire T.35 jet (A79-656), which is on static display. * A Matra R530 Guided Missile System * A Bofors antiaircraft gun * A cross sectional display of a Bell UH-1 Iroquois (A2-382)used by Australian forces in Vietnam. This particular aircraft ditched at Long Hai Beach in June 1970 after being hit by small arms fire. The wreck was recovered and was written off then cut in two. The other half is at the Point Cook Museum. * A variety of WW2 era engines and propellers collected from aircraft that visited Townsville during that period.

White only has the line of pawns and two gold plus their king. Black has the usual setup of twenty pieces. The handicap is not a part of the current official handicap system of the Japan Shogi Association, but it is still used by novice players and has received joseki treatment in shogi texts. Openings Unlike the larger 10-Piece and 9-Piece handicaps, the 8-Piece is more balanced with White having the minimum number of pieces needed to defend their line of pawns from Black's early bishop attacks. The first couple of moves by White are crucial. The fastest attack that Black can initiate is via their bishop. Once their bishop's diagonal is open, the bishop is directly attacking White's pawn on 33. Therefore, White must address this threat in their first two moves. Additionally, once the bishop is mobile, Black may also threaten White's right edge pawn on 93. White must accordingly address this in their first two moves as well. If these two points are not defended properly, then Black will succeed in breaching White's camp very early in the game. 1...G-32. White prepares for the bishop attack on 33 by defending the pawns on 23, 33, and 43. Alternately, White's king may move to 42 defending 33 if White intends to position the king on the left side of their board as suggested by Hosking. 2.P-76. Black opens their bishop's diagonal. 2...G-72. White moves their gold to defend the pawns on files 6‚Äì8. Additionally, Black is also threatening to move their bishop to 66 attacking White's edge. If White does not move their gold to 72 by their second move, then White will not be fast enough to actually defend 93. (See example in next subsection.) The first two moves by White may also be transposed to the order 1...G-72 2.P-76 G-32 (or 1...G-72 2.P-76 K-42). What is essential is that the 32 and 82 squares are defended before Black's second move (or the third move of the game). Failing to defend ninth file To the right is an example of White failing to defend the eighth file pawn by their second move and the ninth file pawn by their third move. Since White's gold was not moved, Black breaks through White's camp. 3.‚òóB-66 5.‚òóP-56 This is the line suggested by Kageyama & Kimura (1955). 3.B-66 G-82. As in the 9-Piece handicap, Black attacks White's ninth file pawn forcing White to defend with the gold. 4.P-56. Black pushes their central pawn in order to allow the bishop to move to the 57 square. (Cf. 9-Piece¬ß‚òó4.P-56.) Climbing Silver After the initial three moves, the general strategy for Black that professional player Kazuharu Shoshi recommends is to activate both the bishop and the rook and start a Climbing Silver attack (‰∏ãÊâãÊ£íÈäÄÊà¶Ê≥ï ). He offers the two variations shown below. The first variation positions White's king on the right side while the second positions the king on the left. 3.P-26. In order to build a Climbing Silver structure, Black must create an open space in their line of pawns so that their right silver can climb out. The general idea of Climbing Silver to create an attack with their (second file) rook pawn, right silver, and rook with the bishop also thrown in for good measure. The initial pawn push on the second file accomplishes this as well as signaling to White what Black is planning. =‚òñK-52= Shoshi (2000). 3.P-26 K-52 4.P-25. 8.S-35. The Climbing Silver formation is complete with Black's silver on rank 5. =‚òñK-42= Shoshi (2000). Edge attack Another strategy for Black is an edge attack. Rook-34 variation Yet another possibility is recommended by Fairbairn (1981) for Static Rook attack in which Black moves their rook sideways to the third file.

It is one of the biggest churches in the city. History The cathedral was built on a hill where an orange plantation once stood. Construction started on the property in 1963 with further additions in 2000. Built in the style of Modern Architecture, it was designed by the architect Ng√¥ Vi·∫øt Th·ª•. Supporting concrete pillars were built close to the walls and gradually bent. Each of the four corners has three such pillars, creating a fairly large space inside the building. The interior of the Cathedral was built following classical Roman Catholic tradition. There are two rows of coloured glass windows located in the upper interior of the Cathedral. Inside, there is a cross made of steel and concrete on a round pillar. The Cathedral has a marble altar located in a small round-shaped space. The building has two wings extending to the right and left; the tomb of the former archbishop Philippe Nguy√™n-Kim-Di√™n (1921-1988) is on the left and a shrine presenting a saint is on the right. In front of the building are two statues: Saint Phero is on the right and on the left is Saint Paulo and other missionaries of the Phu Cam diocese. The Ministry of Tourism describes the cathedral as such: ‚ÄúThe open-space of Phu Cam main cathedral looks like an opening-mouth-dragon and in general Phu Cam cathedral with its top perpendicularly stretching to the sky is very purified and full of artistic and religious character\\". Construction of the Cathedral took nearly 40 years. An older church was torn down and the construction of the new Cathedral started in 1960. During construction, a coup took place during which President Ngo Dinh Diem was killed. Archbishop Ngo Dinh Thuc was in Rome at the time and was unable to return to Vietnam due to the political situation. The construction was still taking place in 1968 when it was heavily damaged by bombing during the Tet Offensive. Construction was delayed and ultimately abandoned after 1975. Construction was completed in May 2000, with the official consecration taking place during the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul on 28 and 29 June 2000. Saints Peter and Paul are the patrons of the Parish. The head of the Roman Catholic Church established a Resident Superior Head Office of the Vatican in Vietnam (which oversaw Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos together) next to the former cathedral in Hu·∫ø (that was demolished to make way for the current Ph·ªß Cam Cathedral) on May 20, 1925. This office was then moved to Hanoi in 1951. Over 400 people supportive of the South Vietnam regime were rounded up at the Cathedral in February 1968 by the Viet Cong, when they were led to the creek and shot dead. A new pastoral house was opened at the cathedral on October 8, 2014 with Archbishop Francis Xavier L√™ VƒÉn H·ªìng hosting a ribbon-cutting and blessing ceremony for inauguration the pastoral house. It was built with money collected in the area and from benefactors abroad.

The new interactivity-enhanced spaces born of the new digital era has create \\"digital enclosures\\" in both a physical and virtual sense. It is this enclosure that allows for individuals or companies to own, operate, and claim ownership over the information generated by the users who interact within their boundaries. Andrejevic cites the example of Google and Earthlink to provide the city of San Francisco with free wireless access within the city in multiple articles. This project was to be funded through \\"contextual advertising\\", the use of custom-targeted ads developed by tracking the location of users throughout the day. This potentially opens the door for google to create custom algorithms to gain information on users from search engine inquiries, map requests, and even Gmail accounts. Companies who invest in such information from enclosures due to their potentially profit contributes to what Andrejevic describes as \\"the work of being watched\\", individuals who unknowingly or willingly submit to giving up their information that generates such economic value in exchange for use of digital commodities. Andrejevic connects this idea back to the forcible separation of workers from the means of production ‚Äì a process defined by Marx as \\"primitive\\" accumulation. Marx developed this from the first agrarian enclosure of land, where works were separated from the land in order to force workers to regain access to be contractually regulated. The model of digital enclosures is necessary to understanding new information commodities being valuable resources in the new era of digital capitalism. The private ownership of such enclosures aims to separate users from the means of interaction, transaction, communication, and expression, much like the farmer's separation from the land some centuries before. Andrejevic suggests that this new form of separation is even more seductive as it provides real benefits to the users. Communication and the purchasing of goods are streamlined and simplified, but users have little control over how their collected information is collected, used, and sold. Legal scholar James Boyle illustrates that digital enclosures literalize the physical metaphor of the 'second enclosure' movement that is the enclosure of \\"the intangible commons of the mind.\\" The second enclosure movement refers to a variety of strategies that have the purpose of privatizing, controlling and commodifying both information and intellectual property. Andrejevic outlines numerous implications for digital enclosures in the new era of digital capitalism. The first being the insincere use of users data, such as marketing dieting pills to those who have searched for results regarding losing weight or dating website to users whose data suggest their single relationship status. The second, the censorship of users is already in practice. Andrejevic cites the example of Microsoft suppressing blogs at the request of the Chinese government and then releasing the location of specific anti-government bloggers. Microsoft did so because of the potential lucrative market in China. This has even occurred in the United States. Mark Andrejevic states: \\"On the one hand, the Internet might represent a very powerful tool for free expression even ‚Äì or perhaps especially ‚Äì under authoritarian regimes. On the other hand, to the extent that expression becomes increasingly reliant upon private corporations more committed to the realities of the bottom line than to abstract principles of civil liberties, the technology that facilitates the ability to challenge entrenched power could evolve into a breathtakingly efficient tool for monitoring, tracking, and filtering dissident expression.\\" See also * Mass surveillance in the United States * Global surveillance References Category:Internet culture ","title":"Digital enclosure"},{"id":"52211120","text":"In signal processing, the multidimensional empirical mode decomposition (multidimensional EMD) is the extension of the 1-D EMD algorithm into multiple-dimensional signal.

Recently, several methods of Empirical Mode Decomposition have been used to analyze characterization of multidimensional signals. In this article, we will introduce the basics of Multidimensional Empirical Mode Decomposition, and then look into various approaches used for Multidimensional Empirical Mode Decomposition. Introduction to empirical mode decomposition (EMD) Flow chart of basic EMD algorithm The \\"empirical mode decomposition\\" method can extract global structure and deal with fractal-like signals. The EMD method was developed so that the data can be examined in an adaptive time‚Äìfrequency‚Äìamplitude space for nonlinear and non-stationary signals. The EMD method decomposes the input signal into few Intrinsic Mode functions (IMF) and a residue. The given equation will be as follows: : I(n)=\\\\sum_{m=1}^M \\\\operatorname{IMF}_m(n)+\\\\operatorname{Res}_M(n) where I(n) is the multi- component signal. \\\\operatorname{IMF}_m(n) is the M^\\\\text{th} intrinsic mode function, and \\\\operatorname{Res}_M(n) represents residue corresponding to M intrinsic modes. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition To improve the accuracy of measurements, the ensemble mean is a powerful approach, where data are collected by separate observations, each of which contains different noise over an ensemble of universe's. To generalize this ensemble idea, noise is introduced to the single data set, x(t), as if separate observations were indeed being made as an analogue to a physical experiment that could be repeated many times. The added white noise is treated as the possible random noise that would be encountered in the measurement process. Under such conditions, the i th ‚Äòartificial‚Äô observation will be x_i(t)=x(t)+w_i(t) In the case of only one observation, one of the multiple-observation ensembles is mimicked by adding not arbitrary but different copies of white noise, wi(t), to that single observation as given in the equation. Although adding noise may result in smaller signal to-noise ratio, the added white noise will provide a uniform reference scale distribution to facilitate EMD; therefore, the low signal-noise ratio does not affect the decomposition method but actually enhances it to avoid the mode mixing. Based on this argument, an additional step is taken by arguing that adding white noise may help to extract the true signals in the data, a method that is termed Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) The EEMD consists of the following steps: # Adding a white noise series to the original data. # Decomposing the data with added white noise into oscillatory components. # Repeating step 1 and step 2 again and again, but with different white noise series added each time. # Obtaining the (ensemble) means of the corresponding intrinsic mode functions of the decomposition as the final result. In these steps, EEMD uses two properties of white noise: # The added white noise leads to relatively even distribution of extrema distribution on all timescales. # The dyadic filter bank property provides a control on the periods of oscillations contained in an oscillatory component, significantly reducing the chance of scale mixing in a component. Through ensemble average, the added noise is averaged out.  Pseudo-bi- dimensional empirical mode decomposition  It should be pointed out here that the ‚Äúpseudo-BEMD‚Äù method is not limited to only one-spatial dimension; rather, it can be applied to data of any number of spatial-temporal dimensions. Since the spatial structure is essentially determined by timescales of the variability of a physical quantity at each location and the decomposition is completely based on the characteristics of individual time series at each spatial location, there is no assumption of spatial coherent structures of this physical quantity. When a coherent spatial structure emerges, it reflects better the physical processes that drive the evolution of the physical quantity on the timescale of each component. Therefore, we expect this method to have significant applications in spatial-temporal data analysis. To design a pseudo-BEMD algorithm the key step is to translate the algorithm of the 1D EMD into a Bi-dimensional Empirical Mode Decomposition(BEMD) and further extend the algorithm to three or more dimensions which is similar to the BEMD by extending the procedure on successive dimensions.For a 3D data cube of i √ó j √ó k elements, the pseudo- BEMD will yield detailed 3D components of m √ó n √ó q where m, n and q are the number of the IMFs decomposed from each dimension having i, j, and k elements, respectively. Mathematically let us represent a 2D signal in the form of ixj matrix form with a finite number of elements. : X(i,j) = \\\\begin{bmatrix}x(1,1) & x(1,2) & \\\\cdots & x(1,j) \\\\x(2,1) & x(2,2) & \\\\cdots & x(1,j) \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & & \\\\vdots \\\\x(i,1) & x(i,2) & \\\\cdots & x(i,j) \\\\end{bmatrix} At first we perform EMD in one direction of X(i,j), Row wise for instance, to decompose the data of each row into m components, then to collect the components of the same level of m from the result of each row decomposition to make a 2D decomposed signal at that level of m. Therefore, m set of 2D spatial data are obtained : \\\\begin{align} RX(1,i,j) & = \\\\begin{bmatrix}x(1,1,1) & x(1,1,2) & \\\\cdots & x(1,1,j) \\\\x(1,2,1) & x(1,2,2) & \\\\cdots & x(1,2,j) \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & & \\\\vdots \\\\x(1,i,1) & x(1,i,2) & \\\\cdots & x(1,i,j) \\\\end{bmatrix} [6pt] RX(2,i,j) & = \\\\begin{bmatrix}x(2,1,1) & x(2,1,2) & \\\\cdots & x(2,1,j) \\\\x(2,2,1) & x(2,2,2) & \\\\cdots & x(2,2,j) \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & & \\\\vdots \\\\ x(2,i,1) & x(2,i,2) & \\\\cdots & x(2,i,j) \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\qquad & \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\vdots \\\\qquad \\\\vdots [6pt] RX(m,i,j) & = \\\\begin{bmatrix}x(m,1,1) & x(m,1,2) & \\\\cdots & x(m,1,j) \\\\x(m,2,1) & x(m,2,2) & \\\\cdots & x(m,2,j) \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & & \\\\vdots \\\\x(m,i,1) & x(m,i,2) & \\\\cdots & x(m,i,j) \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\end{align} where RX (1, i, j), RX (2, i, j), and RX (m, i, j) are the m sets of signal as stated (also here we use R to indicate row decomposing). The relation between these m 2D decomposed signals and the original signal is given as X(i,j)=\\\\sum_{ k \\\\mathop =1}^mRX(k,i,j) The first row of the matrix RX (m, i, j) is the mth EMD component decomposed from the first row of the matrix X (i, j). The second row of the matrix RX (m, i, j) is the mth EMD component decomposed from the second row of the matrix X (i, j), and so on. Suppose that the previous decomposition is along the horizontal direction, the next step is to decompose each one of the previously row decomposed components RX(m, i, j), in the vertical direction into n components. This step will generate n components from each RX component. For example, the component # RX(1,i,j) will be decomposed into CRX(1,1,i,j), CRX(1,2,i,j),‚Ä¶,CRX(1,n,i,j) # RX(2,i,j) will be decomposed into CRX(2,1,i,j), CRX(2,2,i,j),‚Ä¶, CRX(2,n,i,j) # RX(m,i,j) will be decomposed into CRX(m,1,i,j), CRX(m,2,i,j),‚Ä¶, CRX(m,n,i,j) where C means column decomposing.Finally, the 2D decomposition will result into m√ó n matrices which are the 2D EMD components of the original data X(i,j). The matrix expression for the result of the 2D decomposition is : CRX(m,n,i,j) = \\\\begin{bmatrix}crx(1,1,i,j) & crx(2,1,i,j) & \\\\cdots & crx(m,1,i,j) \\\\crx(1,2,i,j) & crx(2,2,i,j) & \\\\cdots & crx(m,2,i,j) \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & & \\\\vdots \\\\crx(1,n,i,j) & crx(2,n,i,j) & \\\\cdots & crx(m,n,i,j) \\\\end{bmatrix} where each element in the matrix CRX is an i √ó j sub-matrix representing a 2D EMD decomposed component. We use the arguments (or suffixes) m and n to represent the component number of row decomposition and column decomposition, respectively rather than the subscripts indicating the row and the column of a matrix. Notice that the m and n indicate the number of components resulting from row(horizontal) decomposition and then column (vertical) decomposition, respectively. By combining the components of the same scale or the comparable scales with minimal difference will yield a 2D feature with best physical significance. The components of the first row and the first column are approximately the same or comparable scale although their scales are increasing gradually along the row or column. Therefore, combining the components of the first row and the first column will obtain the first complete 2D component (C2D1). The subsequent process is to perform the same combination technique to the rest of the components, the contribution of the noises are distributed to the separate component according to their scales. As a result, the coherent structures of the components emerge, In this way, the pseudo-BEMD method can be applied to reveal the evolution of spatial structures of data. : C2D_L=\\\\sum_{k=1}^mcrx_{k,l}+\\\\sum_{k=l+1}^ncrx_{l,k} Following the convention of 1D EMD, the last component of the complete 2D components is called residue. The decomposition scheme proposed here could be extended to data of any dimensions such as data of a solid with different density or other measurable properties given as I=f(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,\\\\ldots,x_n) In which the subscription, n, indicated the number of dimensions. The procedure is identical as stated above: the decomposition starts with the first dimension,and proceeds to the second and third till all the dimensions are exhausted. The decomposition is still implemented by slices.This new approach is based on separating the original data into one-dimensional slices, then applying ensemble EMD to each one- dimensional slice. The key part of the method is in the construction of the IMF according to the principle of combination of the comparable minimal scale components. For example, the matrix expression for the result of a 3D decomposition is TCRX(m,n,q,i,j,k) where T denotes the depth (or time) decomposition. Based on the comparable minimal scale combination principle as applied in the 2D case, the number of complete 3D components will be the smallest value of m, n, and q. The general equation for deriving 3D components is : C3D_L = \\\\sum_{m=l}^m \\\\sum_{n=\\\\ell}^ntcrx_{m,n,\\\\ell} + \\\\sum_{m=\\\\ell+1}^m \\\\sum_{q=\\\\ell+1}^n tcrx_{m,\\\\ell,q} + \\\\sum_{n=\\\\ell+1}^m \\\\sum_{q=\\\\ell+1}^m tcrx_{\\\\ell,n,q} where denotes the level of the C3D i.e. : \\\\begin{cases} \\\\ell=m=n & \\\\text{if } m=n; \\\\ \\\\ell=m & \\\\text{if } mn. \\\\end{cases} The pseudo-BEMD method has several advantages. For instance, the sifting procedure of the pseudo-BEMD is a combination of one dimensional sifting. It employs 1D curve fitting in the sifting process of each dimension, and has no difficulty as encountered in the 2D EMD algorithms using surface fitting which has the problem of determining the saddle point as a local maximum or minimum.Sifting is the process which separates the IMF and repeats the process until the residue is obtained. The first step of performing sifting is to determine the upper and lower envelopes encompassing all the data by using the spline method. Sifting scheme for pseudo-BEMD is like the 1D sifting where the local mean of the standard EMD is replaced by the mean of multivariate envelope curves. The major disadvantage of this method is that although we could extend this algorithm to any dimensional data we only use it for Two dimension applications. Because the computation time of higher dimensional data would be proportional to the number of IMF's of the succeeding dimensions. Hence it could exceed the computation capacity for a Geo-Physical data processing system when the number of EMD in the algorithm is large. Hence we have mentioned below faster and better techniques to tackle this disadvantage.  Multi-dimensional ensemble empirical mode decomposition.  A Fast and efficient data analysis is very important for large sequences hence the MDEEMD focuses on two important things # Data compression which involves decomposing data into simpler forms. # EEMD on the compressed data; this is the most challenging since on decomposing the compressed data there is a high probability to lose key information. A data compression method that uses principal component analysis (PCA)/empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis or principal oscillation pattern analysis is used to compress data. = Principal component analysis (PCA) or empirical orthogonal function analysis (EOF). = The principal component analysis/empirical orthogonal function analysis (PCA/EOF) has been widely used in data analysis and image compression,its main objective is to reduce a data set containing a large number of variables to a data set containing fewer variables, but that still represents a large fraction of the variability contained in the original data set. In climate studies, EOF analysis is often used to study possible spatial modes (i.e., patterns) of variability and how they change with time . In statistics, EOF analysis is known as principal component analysis (PCA). Typically, the EOFs are found by computing the eigenvalues and eigen vectors of a spatially weighted anomaly covariance matrix of a field. Most commonly, the spatial weights are the cos(latitude) or, better for EOF analysis, the sqrt(cos(latitude)). The derived eigenvalues provide a measure of the percent variance explained by each mode. Unfortunately, the eigenvalues are not necessarily distinct due to sampling issues. North et al. (Mon. Wea. Rev., 1982, eqns 24-26) provide a 'rule of thumb' for determining if a particular eigenvalue (mode) is distinct from its nearest neighbor. Atmospheric and oceanographic processes are typically 'red' which means that most of the variance (power) is contained within the first few modes. The time series of each mode (aka, principle components) are determined by projecting the derived eigen vectors onto the spatially weighted anomalies. This will result in the amplitude of each mode over the period of record. By construction, the EOF patterns and the principal components are independent. Two factors inhibit physical interpretation of EOFs: (i)The orthogonality constraint and (ii) the derived patterns may be domain dependent. Physical systems are not necessarily orthogonal and if the patterns depend on the region used they may not exist if the domain changes. = Spatial-temporal signal using multi-dimensional ensemble empirical mode decomposition = Assume, we have a spatio-temporal data T(s, t), where s is spatial locations (not necessary one dimensional originally but needed to be rearranged into a single spatial dimension) from 1 to N and t temporal locations from 1 to M. Using PCA/EOF, one can express T(s, t) into T(s,t)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^K Y_i(t)V_i(t) where Yi(t) is the ith principal component and Vi(t) the ith empirical orthogonal function (EOF) pattern and K is the smaller one of M and N. PC and EOFs are often obtained by solving the eigenvalue/eigenvector problem of either temporal co-variance matrix or spatial co-variance matrix based on which dimension is smaller. The variance explained by one pair of PCA/EOF is its corresponding eigenvalue divided by the sum of all eigenvalues of the co-variance matrix. If the data subjected to PCA/EOF analysis is all white noise, all eigenvalues are theoretically equal and there is no preferred vector direction for the principal component in PCA/EOF space. To retain most of the information of the data, one needs to retain almost all the PC's and EOF's, making the size of PCA/EOF expression even larger than that of the original but If the original data contain only one spatial structure and oscillate with time, then the original data can be expressed as the product of one PC and one EOF, implying that the original data of large size can be expressed by small size data without losing information, i.e. highly compressible. The variability of a smaller region tends to be more spatio-temporally coherent than that of a bigger region containing that smaller region, and, therefore, it is expected that fewer PC/EOF components are required to account for a threshold level of variance hence one way to improve the efficiency of the representation of data in terms of PC/EOF component is to divide the global spatial domain into a set of sub- regions. If we divide the original global spatial domain into n sub-regions containing N1, N2, . . . , Nn spatial grids, respectively, with all Ni, where i=1, . . . , n, greater than M, where M denotes the number of temporal locations, we anticipate that the numbers of the retained PC/EOF pairs for all sub-regions K1, K2, . . . , Kn are all smaller than K, the total number of data values in PCA/EOF representation of the original data of the global spatial domain by the equation given up is K√ó(N+M).For the new approach of using spatial division, the total number of values in PCA/EOF representatio is : \\\\sum_{i=1}^nK_i(M+N_i)=K'_iN+M\\\\sum_{i=1}^nK_i where : K'_i=\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^nK_iN_i}{N}. Therefore, the compression rate of the spatial domain is as follows : \\\\text{Compression rate} =\\\\frac{NM}{NK'_i+M \\\\sum_{i=1}^nK_i} The advantage of this algorithm is that an optimized division and an optimized selection of PC/EOF pairs for each region would lead to a higher rate of compression and result into significantly lower computation as compared to a Pseudo BEMD extended to higher dimensions.  Fast multidimensional ensemble empirical mode decomposition  For a temporal signal of length M, the complexity of cubic spline sifting through its local extrema is about the order of M, and so is that of the EEMD as it only repeats the spline fitting operation with a number that is not dependent on M. However, as the sifting number (often selected as 10) and the ensemble number (often a few hundred) multiply to the spline sifting operations, hence the EEMD is time consuming compared with many other time series analysis methods such as Fourier transforms and wavelet transforms.The MEEMD employs EEMD decomposition of the time serie s at each division grids of the initial temporal signal, the EEMD operation is repeated by the number of total grid points of the domain. The idea of the fast MEEMD is very simple. As PCA/EOF- based compression expressed the original data in terms of pairs of PCs and EOFs, through decomposing PCs, instead of time series of each grid, and using the corresponding spatial structure depicted by the corresponding EOFs, the computational burden can be significantly reduced. The fast MEEMD includes the following steps: # All pairs of EOF's, Vi, and their corresponding PCs, Yi, of spatio-temporal data over a compressed sub-domain are computed. # The number of pairs of PC/EOF that are retained in the compressed data is determined by the calculation of the accumulated total variance of leading EOF/PC pairs. # Each PC Yi is decomposed using EEMD, i.e. ::: Y_i=\\\\sum_{j=1}^nc_{j,i}+r_{n,i} :: where cj,i represents simple oscillatory modes of certain frequencies and rn,i is the residual of the data Yi. The result of the ith MEEMD component Cj is obtained as ::: C_j=\\\\sum_{j=1}^{40} c_{j,i} V_i. In this compressed computation, we have used the approximate dyadic filter bank properties of EMD/EEMD. Note that a detailed knowledge of the intrinsic mode functions of a noise corrupted signal can help in estimating the significance of that mode. It is usually assumed that the first IMF captures most of the noise and hence from this IMF we could estimate the Noise level and estimate the noise corrupted signal eliminating the effects of noise approximately. This method is known as denoising and detrending. Another advantage of using the MEEMD is that the mode mixing is reduced significantly due to the function of the EEMD. The denoising and detrending strategy can be used for image processing to enhance an image and similarly it could be applied to Audio Signals to remove corrupted data in speech. The MDEEMD could be used to break down images and audio signals into IMF and based on the knowledge of the IMF perform necessary operations. The decomposition of an image is very advantageous for radar-based application the decomposition of an image could reveal land mines etc.  Parallel implementation of multi-dimensional ensemble empirical mode decomposition.  In MEEMD, although ample parallelism potentially exists in the ensemble dimensions and/or the non-operating dimensions, several challenges still face a high performance MEEMD implementation. Bi-Dimensional EMD corrupted with Noise # Dynamic data variations: In EEMD, white noises change the number of extrema causing some irregularity and load imbalance, and thus slowing down the parallel execution. # Stride memory accesses of high- dimensional data: High dimensional data are stored in non-continuous memory locations. Accesses along high dimensions are thus strided and uncoalesced, wasting available memory bandwidth. # Limited resources to harness parallelism: While the independent EMDs and/or EEMDs comprising an MEEMD provide high parallelism, the computational capacities of multi-core and many- core processors may not be sufficient to fully exploit the inherent parallelism of MEEMD. Moreover, increased parallelism may increase memory requirements beyond the memory capacities of these processors.Bi-Dimensional EMD Intrinsic mode function along with the residue eliminating the noise level.In MEEMD, when a high degree of parallelism is given by the ensemble dimension and/or the non-operating dimensions, the benefits of using a thread- level parallel algorithm are threefold. # It can exploit more parallelism than a block-level parallel algorithm. # It does not incur any communication or synchronization between the threads until the results are merged since the execution of each EMD or EEMD is independent. # Its implementation is like the sequential one, which makes it more straightforward.  OpenMp implementation.  The EEMDs comprising MEEMD are assigned to independent threads for parallel execution, relying on the OpenMP runtime to resolve any load imbalance issues. Stride memory accesses of high-dimensional data are eliminated by transposing these data to lower dimensions, resulting in better utilization of cache lines. The partial results of each EEMD are made thread- private for correct functionality. The required memory depends on the number of OpenMP threads and is managed by OpenMP runtime  CUDA implementation.  In the GPU CUDA implementation, each EMD, is mapped to a thread. The memory layout, especially of high-dimensional data, is rearranged to meet memory coalescing requirements and fit into the 128-byte cache lines. The data is first loaded along the lowest dimension and then consumed along a higher dimension. This step is performed when the Gaussian noise is added to form the ensemble data. In the new memory layout, the ensemble dimension is added to the lowest dimension to reduce possible branch divergence. The impact of the unavoidable branch divergence from data irregularity, caused by the noise, is minimized via a regularization technique using the on-chip memory. Moreover, the cache memory is utilized to amortize unavoidable uncoalesced memory accesses. Fast and adaptive multidimensional empirical mode decomposition=Concept The fast and adaptive bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (FABEMD) is an improved version of traditional BEMD. The FABEMD can be used in many areas, including medical image analysis, texture analysis and so on. The order statistics filter can help in solving the problems of efficiency and restriction of size in BEMD. Based on the algorithm of BEMD, the implementation method of FABEMD is really similar to BEMD, but the FABEMD approach just changes the interpolation step into a direct envelop estimation method and restricts the number of iterations for every BIMF to one. As a result, two order statistics, including MAX and MIN, will be used for approximating the upper and lower envelope. The size of the filter will depend on the maxima and minima maps obtained from the input. The steps of the FABEMD algorithm are listed below. FABEMD algorithm ;Step 1 ‚Äì Determine and detect local maximum and minimum As the traditional BEMD approach, we can find the jth ITS-BIMF F_{Tj} of any source of input S_{i} by neighboring window method. For FABEMD approach, we choose a different implementation approach. From the input data, we can get an 2D matrix represent : A = \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} a_{11} & \\\\cdots & a_{1N} \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\ a_{M1} & \\\\cdots & a_{MN} \\\\end{array} \\\\right) where a_{MN} is the element location in the matrix A, and we can define the window size to be w_{ex}\\\\times w_{ex}. Thus, we can obtain the maximum and minimum value from the matrix as follows: : a_{mn} \\\\triangleq \\\\begin{cases} \\\\text{local max} & \\\\text{if } a_{mn} > a_{k\\\\ell}, \\\\ \\\\text{local min} & \\\\text{if } a_{mn} < a_{k\\\\ell}, \\\\end{cases} where : k = m - \\\\frac{w_{ex} - 1}{2}:m + \\\\frac{w_{ex} - 1}{2},(k e m) : \\\\ell = n - \\\\frac{w_{ex} - 1}{2}:n + \\\\frac{w_{ex} - 1}{2},(\\\\ell e n) ;Flow chart for FABEMD algorithmStep 2 ‚Äì Obtain the size of window for order- statistic filter At first, we define d_{\\\\mathrm{adj}-\\\\max} and d_{\\\\mathrm{adj}-\\\\min} to be the maximum and minimum distance in the array which is calculated from each local maximum or minimum point to the nearest nonzero element. Also, d_{\\\\mathrm{adj}-\\\\max} and d_{\\\\mathrm{adj}-\\\\min} will be sorted in descending order in the array according to the convenient selection. Otherwise, we will only consider square window. Thus, the gross window width will be as follows: : w_{\\\\max \\\\rm{_en - g}} = \\\\operatorname{minimum} { d_{\\\\mathrm{adj} - \\\\max} } : w_{\\\\max \\\\rm{_en - g}} = \\\\operatorname{maximum} { d_{\\\\mathrm{adj} -\\\\max}} : w_{\\\\min \\\\rm{_en - g}} = \\\\operatorname{minimum} { d_{\\\\mathrm{adj} - \\\\min}} : w_{\\\\min \\\\rm{_en - g}} = \\\\operatorname{maximum} { d_\\\\mathrm{adj - \\\\min}} ;Step 3 ‚Äì Apply order statistics and smoothing filters to obtain the MAX and MIN filter output To obtain the upper and lower envelopes, there should be defined two parameter U_{Ej}(x,y) and L_{Ej}(x,y), and the equation will be as follows: : U_{Ej}(x,y) = \\\\max { F_{Tj}(s,t)} = \\\\frac{1}{w_{sm} \\\\times w_{sm}} \\\\sum_{(s,t) \\\\in Z_{xy}} {U_{Ej}}(s,t) : L_{Ej}(x,y) = \\\\min { F_{Tj}(s,t)} = \\\\frac{1}{w_{sm} \\\\times w_{sm}} \\\\sum_{(s,t) \\\\in Z_{xy}} L_{Ej}(s,t) where Z_{xy} is defined as the square region of window size, and w_{sm} is the window width of the smoothing filter which w_{sm} equals to w_{en}. Therefore, the MAX and MIN filter will form a new 2-D matrix for envelope surface which will not change the original 2-D input data. ;Step 4 ‚Äì Set up an estimation from upper and lower envelopes This step is to make sure that the envelope estimation in FABEMD is nearly closed to the result from BEMD by using interpolation. In order to do comparison, we need to form corresponding matrices for upper envelope, lower envelope and mean envelope by using thin-plate spline surface interpolation to the max and min maps. Advantages This method(FABEMD) provides a way to use less computation to obtain the result rapidly, and it allows us to ensure more accurate estimation of the BIMFs. Even more, the FABEMD is more adaptive to handle the large size input than the traditional BEMD. Otherwise, the FABEMD is an efficient method that we do not need to consider the boundary effects and overshoot-undershoot problems. Limitations There is one particular problem that we will face in this method. Sometimes, there will be only one local maxima or minima element in the input data, so it will cause the distance array to be empty. Partial differential equation-based multidimensional empirical mode decomposition=Concept The Partial Differential Equation-Based Multidimensional Empirical Mode Decomposition(PDE-based MEMD) approach is a way to improve and overcome the difficulties of mean-envelope estimation of a signal from the traditional EMD. The PDE-based MEMD focus on modifying the original algorithm for MEMD. Thus, the result will provide an analytical formulation which can facilitate theoretical analysis and performance observation. In order to perform multidimensional EMD, we need to extend the 1-D PDE-based sifting process to 2-D space as shown by the steps below. Here, we take 2-D PDE-based EMD as an example. PDE-based BEMD algorithm ;Step 1 ‚Äì Extend super diffusion model from 1-D to 2-D Considered a super diffusion matrix function : G_q(x) = \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} g_{q,1}(x) & 0 \\\\ 0&g;_{q,2}(x) \\\\end{array} \\\\right) where {g_{q,i}}(x) represent the qth-order stopping function in direction i. Then, based on the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations, diffusion equation will be: : u_t(x,t) = \\\\operatorname{div}(\\\\alpha {G_1} abla u(x,t) - (1 - \\\\alpha ){G_2} abla \\\\Delta u(x,t)) where \\\\alpha is the tension parameter, and we assumed that q=2 . ;Step 2 ‚Äì Connect the relationship between diffusion model and PDEs on implicit surface In order to relate to PDEs, the given equation will be : u_t(x,t) = -( - 1)^q abla _S^{2q} u(x,t) where abla _S^{2q} is the 2qth-order differential operator on u intrinsic to surface S, and the initial condition for the equation will be u(y,t)=f for any y on surface S. ;Step 3 ‚Äì Consider all the numerical resolutions To obtain the theoretical and analysis result from the previous equation, we need to make an assumption. Assumption: The numerical resolution schemes are assumed to be 4th-order PDE with no tension, and the equation for 4th-order PDE will be : u_t = -\\\\sum_{i,j = 1}^2 \\\\partial_{x_i}^1(g_i\\\\partial_{x_i}^1\\\\partial_{x_j}^2u) First of all, we will explicit scheme by approximating the PDE-based sifting process. : U^{k + 1} = \\\\left(I - \\\\Delta t\\\\sum_{i,j = 1}^2 L_{ij} \\\\right) U^k where U is a vector which consists of the value of each pixel, L_{ij} is a matrix which is a difference approximation to the operator, and \\\\Delta t is a small time step. Secondly, we can use additive operator splitting (AOS) scheme to improve the property of stability, because the small time step \\\\Delta t will be unstable when it comes to a large time step. Finally, we can use the alternating direction implicit (ADI) scheme. By using ADI-type schemes, it is suggested that to mix a derivative term to overcome the problem that ADI-type schemes can only be used in second-order diffusion equation. The numerically solved equation will be : : U^{k + 1} = \\\\left(\\\\prod_{n = 1}^2 (I - \\\\Delta t A_{nn}) \\\\right)^{-1} (I + \\\\Delta t\\\\sum_{i = 1}^2 \\\\sum_{j e i} A_{ij} ) U^k where A_{ij} is a matrix which is the central difference approximation to the operator a_{ij} \\\\partial_{x_i}^1 \\\\partial_{x_j}^2 Advantages Based on the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations directly, this approach provides a good way to obtain and develop theoretical and numerical results. In particular, the PDE- based BEMD can work well for image decomposition fields. This approach can be applied to extract transient signal and avoiding the indeterminacy characterization in some signals. Boundary processing in bidimensional empirical decomposition=Concept There are some problems in BEMD and boundary extending implementation in the iterative sifting process, including time consuming, shape and continuity of the edges, decomposition results comparison and so on. In order to fix these problems, the Boundary Processing in Bidimensional Empirical Decomposition (BPBEMD) method was created. The main points of the new method algorithm will be described next. BPBEMD algorithm The few core steps for BPBEMD algorithm are: ;Step 1 Assuming the size of original input data and resultant data to be N\\\\times N and (N+2M)\\\\times(N+2M), respectively, we can also define that original input data matrix to be in the middle of resultant data matrix. ;Step 2 Divide both original input data matrix and resultant data matrix into blocks of M\\\\times M size. ;Step 3 Find the block which is the most similar to its neighbor block in the original input data matrix, and put it into the corresponding resultant data matrix. ;Step 4 Form a distance matrix which the matrix elements are weighted by different distances between each block from those boundaries. ;Step 5 Implement iterative extension when resultant data matrix faces a huge boundary extension, we can see that the block in original input data matrix is corresponding to the block in resultant data matrix. Advantages This method can process larger number of elements than traditional BEMD method. Also, it can shorten the time consuming for the process. Depended on using nonparametric sampling based texture synthesis, the BPBEMD could obtain better result after decomposing and extracting. Limitations Because most of image inputs are non-stationary which don‚Äôt exist boundary problems, the BPBEMD method is still lack of enough evidence that it is adaptive to all kinds of input data. Also, this method is narrowly restricted to be use on texture analysis and image processing. Applications In the first part, these MEEMD techniques can be used on Geophysical data sets such as climate, magnetic, seismic data variability which takes advantage of the fast algorithm of MEEMD. The MEEMD is often used for nonlinear geophysical data filtering due to its fast algorithms and its ability to handle large amount of data sets with the use of compression without losing key information. The IMF can also be used as a signal enhancement of Ground Penetrating Radar for nonlinear data processing; it is very effective to detect geological boundaries from the analysis of field anomalies. In the second part, the PDE-based MEMD and FAMEMD can be implemented on audio processing, image processing and texture analysis. Because of its several properties, including stability, less time consuming and so on, PDE-based MEMD method works well for adaptive decomposition, data denoising and texture analysis. Furthermore, the FAMEMD is a great method to reduce computation time and have a precise estimation in the process. Finally, the BPBEMD method has good performance for image processing and texture analysis due to its property to solve the extension boundary problems in recent techniques.

It is a shrub with warty, hairy branches and leaves and large groups of creamy-white, four-petalled flowers in late winter to spring. Description Zieria tuberculata is a shrub which grows to a height of and has warty branches and leaves which are also covered with star-like hairs, usually visible only with a magnifier. The leaves are composed of three narrow leaflets with the central one, long and wide with a stalk long. The leaflets are dull green on the upper surface, whitish and warty on the lower side. The flowers are creamy-white and are arranged in upper leaf axils in large groups of up to 200. The groups are shorter than the leaves and each flower is in diameter on a stalk long. There are four narrow triangular sepal lobes less than long and four petals long. In common with other zierias, there are only four stamens. Flowering occurs from late winter to spring. Taxonomy and naming Zieria tuberculata was first formally described in 2002 by James Armstrong and the description was published in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (tuberculata) is a Latin word meaning \\"full of lumps\\". Distribution and habitat This zieria occurs in the Mount Gulaga area, growing in exposed, rocky outcrops on the edge of rainforest. Ecology This species is pollinated by pollen-feeding beetles and flies and by nectar- feeding flies. Conservation Zieria tuberculata is listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act and under the New South Wales NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act.

Because of this disproportionate influence, they found that any errors by the central person would make the entire group underperform.

The cathedral features glass and ceiling paintings, prominent pillars on both sides modeled on Greek pillars, carved doors and a high altar with a hexagonal dome on top of it. It is located at Misonmore in Chhota parua Village which is 7 kilometers aways from the City limits. History This cathedral that took three years and ten months to complete was inaugurated and dedicated by Bishop Alphonsus D'Souza S.J. on 17 November 2010. In 1962, Fr. Albinus Kujur began a mission center at Chotaparua in a small tin house which had a chapel, living room and a refectory. When the Diocese of Raiganj was erected in 1978 the first Bishop Leo Tigga S.J. stayed in the same house till the present Bishop's House was constructed. Realizing the need to have a larger parish church, Fr. Verghese Kozhikadan began the construction of the parish church in 1972 which was completed in 1974. This tin roofed church subsequently became the cathedral of the Raiganj Diocese when the diocese was created in 1978. The same church continued to serve as the cathedral of the diocese when Dr. Alphonsus D'Souza S.J. was appointed as the Bishop of Raiganj. As the old tin roofed cathedral had been leaking during the rainy seasons and the space being inadequate to hold the increasing catholic population, there had been a proposal since 2002 to have a new building for the cathedral. However, being concerned with the spiritual and material wellbeing of the people, Bishop Alphonsus resisted spending huge amount of money that was required for the construction of a new cathedral. It was in 2004, while accompanying Bishop Alphonsus from the Malda railway station on his way back from a visit to his native village in Moodubelle, the treasurer of the diocese and secretary to the Bishop, Fr. Sunny M.V. once again put forward the suggestion for a new building for the cathedral. The Bishop thought for a while and said that the proposal can be considered. Construction View of Raiganj Church Having given his consent to have a new cathedral, Bishop Alphonsus constituted a committee with Fr. Sunny as the convener and Vicar Generals-Fr. S. Santhappan and Fr. Patras Bara, Fr. Michael Raj and the then Pro-Vicar, Fr. Kishore Baxla as members to plan and execute the construction of the cathedral in 2005. It took nearly one year to get the necessary permission from the government authorities and another year to finalize the plan of the cathedral. Having assigned the task of preparing a plan for the cathedral, Fr. Sunny wanted to see some of the famous churches and cathedrals in different parts of India and went to various places such as Kerala, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. However, while observing various churches and cathedrals, Fr. Sunny had no intention of copying their architecture, but to get inspiration to produce a unique type of architecture without a parallel in the entire country. He accessed internet for various types of European architecture right from Gothic to Renaissance and from Roman to Greek and Baroque. Piecing together the examples that he had collected from his visits to various churches and cathedrals in India and from the internet, Fr. Sunny with the help of a local artist Gurupada Sarkar prepared a drawing and approached an architect in Kolkata, Arvinda Chatterjee who prepared the final structural plan. Inauguration With the plan of the proposed new cathedral in hand, the foundation stone for the construction was laid behind the existing dilapidated old cathedral on 9 January 2007. The construction work went on for three years and ten months under the guidance of Bishop Alphonsus and active supervision of Fr. Sunny. Following the completion of the construction of the cathedral it was inaugurated, blessed and dedicated on 17 November 2010 by Bishop Alphonsus D'Souza S.J. in the presence of eight other Bishops including the Archbishop of Patna and Bishops of Purnea, Baruipur, Asansol, Krishnagar, Bagdogra, Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling. The dedication ceremony was attended by many Major Superiors, 600 priests and religious and about 30,000 faithful from all over West Bengal and nearby dioceses of Dumka and Purnea.

Parashot The parashah sections listed here are based on the Aleppo Codex.As implemented in the Jewish Publication Society's 1917 edition of the Hebrew Bible in English. Isaiah 2 is a part of the Prophecies about Judah and Israel (Isaiah 1-12). {P}: open parashah. : {P} 2:1-4 {P} 2:5-11 {P} 2:12-22 {P} The mountain of the Lord's house (2:1‚Äì4) This part is the beginning of an oracle which comprises chapters 2-4, with the basic theme of the glorious future of Jerusalem. Verse 1 :The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. KJV A new superscription inserted here may serve to emphasize the originality of this prophecy as Isaiah's, as the subsequent words of oracle (verses 2‚Äì4) can also be found in the book of Micah with minor differences. Verse 2 :And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. KJV The oracle in verses 2‚Äì4 bears a close similarity to but with a different conclusion. Verse 3 :And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.

KJV Many speeches and movements concerned with peace and the adaptation of military technology to peaceful uses have adopted the phrase \\"swords into plowshares\\". The verse is a reversal of , where the ploughshares and pruning hooks are to become swords and spears, as it is related to 'the need for continued conflict'.

It is notable for being Geoffrey Bawa‚Äôs last hotel project and the last project he supervised on site before succumbing to illness.  Geography  The hotel is situated in Wadduwa, a small coastal town located ( south of Colombo. The site originally was a coconut plantation, situated between the beach and the coastal railway line.  History  The hotel was commissioned by Ajit Wijesekera of Union Apparel (a garment manufacturer) in 1994, the design of which was a collaboration between Geoffrey Bawa and Milroy Perera. Work on the project commenced in 1996 and was completed in 1998. The hotel suffered damage to sixteen ground floor rooms as a result of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami but no lives were lost. The hotel was initially managed by Jetwing Hotels until 2008 when it was taken over by Union Resorts, who renovated it and added a reception room/banquet room.  Architecture  The hotel was one of Geoffrey Bawa's last major projects, which Patrick Kunkel of ArchDaily believes \\"represents a slightly more minimalistic approach to his architectural design informed by his earlier work.\\" Australian architect, Ceridwen Owen, describes it as \\"exhibiting a carefully orchestrated sequence of spaces between land and ocean.\\" For the building design Bawa returned to a simple rest house layout, which he first used in 1967 for the Serendib Hotel, but reinterpreted on a grand scale with expansive courtyards and limitless vistas. The main entrance is a lofty porch, with an enclosing wall which screens the hotel from the adjacent railway line. The entrance doors open out to a long axial arcade running across a large garden court, past the hotel lobby and out through the coconut grove towards the sea and the horizon. David Robson in his book, Geoffrey Bawa: The Complete Works, states \\"the sequence of spaces is formal and controlled; the materials highly polished, light in tone and muted in colour and the architecture restrained but monumental.\\" The hotel is an example of Bawa‚Äôs minimalist style, use of space, lengthy corridors, open views, water, terracotta tiles and frangipani trees.  Facilities  The hotel has 100 rooms, two restaurants, three bars, an outdoor pool, and a spa.

Near the end of the film, the virtual reality set of one of the players malfunctions, and it is revealed that the players are remotely controlling battle robots in an actual battlefield, providing skill and tactics. The \\"targets\\" that they are shooting are actual people, including civilians. The player who discovered this then disconnects. Shortly thereafter, he is approached by a robot, presumably controlled by another player, and becomes a target. Reception Ross A. Lincoln of Deadline Hollywood compared the film to Ready Player One and All You Need Is Kill. Meanwhile, Adi Robertson of The Verge praised the film for its combination of documentary-style footage and in-game video game footage. After its release, the video was featured as a \\"Staff Pick\\" for the Vimeo site. On October 2016, the film won Best Short at Animago.

Early life and education Hirshberg studied mechanical engineering at The Ohio State University and received a degree with honors in Design from the Cleveland Institute of Art. After graduation, he continued to study in Europe on a Mary C. Page Fellowship. During college, under the stage name Jerry Paul, he released the hit single \\"Sparkling Blue\\" in 1959 and opened for well-known musicians such as Bobby Rydell, Fabian, and Frankie Avalon. Hirshberg's first automobile was a Volkswagen Beetle. Automotive design Hirshberg started his career in automotive design with General Motors in 1964, where he created designs for the Pontiac and Buick divisions under Bill Mitchell. The most distinctive GM design from Hirshberg was the 1971 \\"boattail\\" Buick Riviera, where he was tasked with interpreting Mitchell's original concept. By the time he departed GM, he was the Buick/Pontiac chief designer. Regarding his time at GM, Hirshberg recalled in 1999 that \\"[the car design trend] was certainly sexual, but it was the sexual fantasies of men. When we lapsed, we were doing design pornography.\\" He left GM in 1980 after being recruited to join Nissan, where he served as the founding director and eventual President of their first design studio in the United States, Nissan Design International (NDI), based in La Jolla, California. In 1982, NDI had thirty employees, which Hirshberg called an \\"experiment in intercultural creativity.\\" NDI, along with Toyota's Calty studio, were some of the earliest California-based automotive design studios established by foreign and domestic manufacturers throughout the 1970s and 80s. NDI took on several commissions outside automotive design in order to stay creative, including the commercially successful \\"Bubble Burner\\" golf club line for nearby TaylorMade, a yacht, and a computer for RDI Computer Corporation. Mickey Kaus in 1999 attributed Nissan's poor sales performance throughout the 90s to the \\"loser designs\\" produced by NDI under Hirshberg, although Hirshberg had stated earlier in 1999 that Nissan had been directing conservative designs from Japan since the early 90s after the marketplace failure of the Infiniti J30. By the late 90s, approximately 75% of Nissan vehicles marketed in the United States were designed at NDI. In 1999, Hirshberg served as the spokesman for Nissan advertising in America. He retired from Nissan at the end of June 2000, turning down a potential promotion to Nissan's global design chief, and continued to pursue artistic interests in retirement. He died of cancer on November 10, 2019.

He was known for his studies on structures and configurations of terpenoids and synthesis of Vetiver Oil and natural musk. He was the vice-president of the Indian National Science Academy and was an elected fellow of the academy as well as the Indian Academy of Sciences. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1962, for his contributions to chemical sciences.  Biography  His parents, Sirish Chandra, a Sanskrit scholar and Kadambinidevi, a homemaker, came from Sylhet, a town on the banks of River Surma in the undivided Bengal of the British India (now in Bangladesh), and it was here Sasanka Chandra Bhattacharyya was born on 31 August 1918. His college education was at Calcutta University College of Science also called Rajabazar Science College from where he passed BSc in 1938 and MSc in 1940 during which time he had the opportunity to study under S. S. Guha Sarkar, a noted chemist of the time. Moving to Bengaluru in 1941, he joined the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and did doctoral research under P. C. Guha, a known organic chemist but submitted his doctoral thesis on sandalwood oil chemistry at Dhaka University in 1943 which awarded him the degree a year later. He would later enroll himself at Cambridge University in 1945 under the guidance of B. Lythgoe, a Royal Society fellow, to secure a second PhD in 1949, working on Centella asiatica, a plant used for treating leprosy. He started his career as a research chemist with Herts Pharmaceuticals but it lasted only one year (1949‚Äì50). Returning in 1950 to India which had attained freedom by that time, Bhattacharyya joined IISc as a faculty member at their department of chemistry and when an opportunity came at the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), he took it up to start a service which lasted a decade and a half as a senior scientific officer in 1951. At NCL, he established a new division for essential oils, with assistance from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research where he became the founder deputy director. His next move was to the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai in 1966 as a senior professor where he established the Department of Chemistry and held the position of a deputy director at the time of his departure 1976. A year later, he joined Bose Institute, Kolkata as its director and served the institution till his superannuation in 1984 but continued his association with IIT, Mumbai as an honorary visiting professor. Sasanka Bhattacharrya was married to Geeta Bhattacharyya. The couple had a son and two daughters and after the demise of his wife in 1999, he mainly lived with one of his daughters in Dehradun where he died on 19 May 2013, at the age of 94.  Legacy  Bhattacharyya's research history starts from his days at Calcutta University where he studied under S. S. Guha Sarkar and the duo's work on Reagents in inorganic chemistry has returned two articles published in 1941. Later, his work with B. Lythgoe at Cambridge University focused on the anti-leprosy properties of Centella asiatica where they attempted to elucidate the chemical constituents of the medicinal herb and their researches appeared as two articles in Nature. He carried forward his researches on terpernoids in India too and worked on the synthesis of natural musk odorous compounds which resulted in the development of compounds such as muscone, dihydrocivetone, exaltone, exaltolide and ambrettolide which are reported to have commercial value. Besides, he also synthesised compounds such as jasmines, rose oxide, santalols and santalenes. One of the major contributions of the research group led by Bhattacharyya was the demonstration of the antipodal nature of constituents of Vetiver Oil. Overall, he was known to have isolated over 100 compounds falling under terpenoids and coumarins categories. Bhattacharyya published his researches in over 250 articles and he and his team held patents for some of the processes they developed. On the academic front, he gathered a team of researchers under a new division for research on essential oils and established the department of chemistry of Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai where he served as a senior professor for over a decade. During his career, he mentored 90 doctoral students and served as an adviser to House of Tatas. He was associated with the Journal of Indian Chemical Society as its editor (1967‚Äì70) and with Indian Journal of Chemistry as a member of its editorial board. He served in the council of the Indian National Science Academy from 1978 to 1980 and was a life member of the Life Member of Perfumes and Flavours Association of India (now known as Fragrances and Flavours Association of India).  Awards and honours  Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda awarded Bhattacharyya K. G. Naik Gold Medal in 1960 and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research chose him as the third recipient of the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1962. He received the degree of Doctor of Science (DSc) of Cambridge University in 1964 and two years later, the Indian National Science Academy elected him as its fellow in 1966. He received the Platinum Jubilee Medal of the Indian Institute of Science in 1985 and the IFEAT Medal in 1989. He became an elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences in 1975 and was a fellow of the Indian Chemical Society. He delivered several award orations; Acharya P. C. Roy Memorial Lecture and Medal (1969) and Acharya J. C. Ghosh Memorial Lecture and Medal (1971) of the Indian Chemical Society, Professor K. Venkatraman Lecture Award of University of Mumbai (1970) and G. P. Chatterjee Lecture Award of Indian National Science Academy (1981) are some of the notable ones among them. The Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai has instituted an award, Prof. S.C.

Forty-six passengers were killed, making it the deadliest disaster in Boston until surpassed by the Cocoanut Grove fire in 1942. Background Summer Street Bridge in 2016, showing the tracks that the retractable sections slid on By 1916, the Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) operated all streetcar and rapid transit lines in Boston. Original plans had called for an elevated rapid transit loop line through South Boston; however, that line was never constructed. Instead, South Boston was served by a network of surface streetcar lines that connected to the rapid transit lines at South Station, Broadway, and Andrew Square. The line from City Point to Washington Street served many industrial workers who worked along East First Street and Summer Street in South Boston. It ran along Summer Street for most of its length, crossing the 1899-built Summer Street Bridge over Fort Point Channel to cross into downtown Boston. The retractable bridge has two sliding sections of roadway ‚Äì one for inbound lanes, one for outbound ‚Äì that can move away from the bridge at a 45-degree angle to create a channel for ships to pass. Incident At 5:13 pm on November 7, 1916, streetcar #393 began an inbound run from City Point with motorman Gerald Walsh at the controls. The car was an extra, operated to fill a gap between scheduled service. Walsh had not worked that route before, nor had the conductor George McKeon, but both were familiar with the area. Car #393 was a typical 1900-built streetcar, a workhorse of the BERy fleet of the day. As it approached the Summer Street Bridge, it was full with around 60 passengers on board. The bridge was in the midst of opening to allow a ship to pass; the inbound roadway was already slid to its furthest position. Walsh failed to obey a small stop sign located at Melcher Street, though he slowed for a boarding passenger. Walsh noticed the open bridge too late to stop; the wheels locked and the streetcar crashed through a set of metal gates and into the channel. Heavy with passengers, it sank quickly into the cold waters of the channel, some deep. Walsh, McKeon, and around 15 passengers manage to escape the car and were rescued by tugboats and passing pedestrians. Forty-six passengers drowned, many still inside the crowded streetcar. Aftermath An MBTA route 7 bus ‚Äì the descendant of the streetcar route run in 1916 ‚Äì on the bridge in 2017 Divers from the Hugh Nawn company began work at 9 pm; bodies were removed from the wreckage from 10 pm to 12:40 am. Forty-five bodies were discovered in the channel and the sunken streetcar; the forty-sixth victim did not wash ashore until May 1917. The Boston newspapers, each vying for the best story, reported body counts as high as 60. The streetcar was removed from the channel at 3:30 am by a crane on the wrecking lighter Admiral. The Public Service Commission ruled the accident to be the fault of Walsh for failing to stop at the posted sign, but noted that such signs were hard to notice and that many drawbridges lacked them entirely. Walsh went to trial for manslaughter in October 1917, with witnesses differing on many aspects of the accident. The bridge tenders claimed the required red lantern had been hung on the gate to warn streetcars of the open bridge, but Walsh claimed he saw no such lantern. Some questioned how the glass lantern had survived the impact of the trolley with the gates, which broke a iron post in two; they alleged that the bridge tenders may have actually hung it after the accident. Walsh was declared not guilty, but he never ran a streetcar again and died around 1932 at age 41. McKoen died in combat in France in July 1918. The disaster was the first major accident involving the BERy. It remained the worst in Boston for many years; the more famous Boston Molasses Disaster in 1919 had less than half the fatalities. It was only surpassed in 1942, when the Cocoanut Grove fire killed nearly 500 people. Car #393 was returned to service but most operators refused to run it; it was converted to a work car and later scrapped. The streetcar route was converted to bus on June 20, 1953. After several reroutings between 1968 and 2005, the modern MBTA route 7 bus follows largely the same route as the streetcar involved in the disaster.

Biography=Early life Born in Clifton, a coal mining town on the hinterlands of Manchester in 1874, Read started work in a mine himself at the age of 12. Read was a labour advocate and joined the Independent Labour Party in 1894. Read and his wife sailed to New Zealand in 1901 settling in Wellington, where he found work as a trade unionist. He became secretary of the Wellington Engine Drivers' Union, later secretary of the Engine Drivers' Federation, and finally from 1917 until his retirement he was the secretary of the Wellington Timber Workers' Union. In 1923 he was made a Justice of the Peace at the request of the Trades Council. Political career Read was a member of the Advisory Committee of the Social Democratic Party from 1915 to 1916. He joined the Labour Party upon the SDP's merger into it. He was also the President of the Wellington Co-operative Society for three years.

Family and early life  Cherussethi Thangal learned Quran and Tajwid in his hometown, then he gained further religious knowledge from scholars including Abdullah ibn Alawi al-Haddad [1634 - 1720]. He went to study in Mecca for a short time, before travelling to India.  In Malabar  Cheruseethi Thangal alighted at Kerala with his brother Sheikh Sayyid Jamaludeen Muhammudul Wahthi in Hijri year 1113 (1701 C.E). They came to Thiruvananthapuram and stayed there for a short while. After that, they stayed in Tanur. Finally, they came to Vadakara and settled there. As a result of tolerance to Muslims and the esteem in which Muslim leaders and scholars were held by Zamorin rulers, Sayyids came to Malabar and started to settle there. Natives and rulers alike held them in high esteem and accepted them. Since locals could not pronounce the Arabic names of all visitors who came and settled in Vadakara, they called them Valiya Seethi Thangal and Cheriya Seethi Thangal. The landlords of Valiyakath ancestral home gave a double-storied house, under their ownership in Thazhengadi, to Thangal brothers to live for free.  In the spiritual world  Cheruseethi Thangal was initiated to Qadariya Tariqath by Sayyid Abdurahman Al Hydrose who came to Malabar from Hadhramaut in 1703 and whose final resting place is Valiyajarathingal at Ponnani.

In April 2014, Governor Martin O'Malley signed a law that decriminalizes the possession of 10 grams or less of marijuana. The measure made such possession a civil infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. The measure took effect on October 1, 2014.Jenna Johnson, Having a small amount of pot in Md. is no longer a criminal case, Washington Post (October 1, 2014).

In 2017, legalization was introduced in the state legislature (sponsored by Democratic Delegate Curt Anderson, Democratic Senator Richard Madaleno, and others) to legalize, tax, and regulate recreational marijuana in the state. The bills would have allowed persons 21 or older to lawfully possess up to an ounce of marijuana and grow up to six marijuana plants and would impose a $30-per-ounce excise tax for cultivators and a 9 percent sales tax for buyers (the same sales tax as for alcohol sales in Maryland). The legislation also contained a provision that would expunge prior convictions for possession of marijuana in those amounts or less.Pat Warren, Maryland Lawmakers Introduce Bill To Legalize Marijuana, CBS Baltimore (January 30, 2017).

The game was developed by Warm Lamp Games and published by Alawar Entertainment. Beholder was released on Steam on November 9, 2016 and supports Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.  Story  Beholder is inspired by dystopian works of George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, and Ray Bradbury. Carl is a government- installed landlord in a totalitarian state. The State appoints Carl to spy on the tenants. The player can bug apartments while tenants are away, search their belongings for whatever can threaten the authority of the State, and profile them. The State requires the player to report anyone capable of violating the law or plotting subversive activities. The game offers the player the choice of either following the commands of the Government or siding with the people who suffer from the oppressive directives. Each game character has their own personality, circumstances, and issues. Every decision that a player makes affects the way the story unfolds. The game has multiple endings, each of them being a sum of the decisions made by the player. Development and release Beholder was developed by the Russian team at Warm Lamp Games, located in Barnaul. The team was created based on the Barnaul division of Alawar Stargaze. The Work on the project began in October 2015. The Beholder prototype contained elements of the economic game, which were expressed in the fact that the residents of the house paid rent to the main character for housing, and the player had to improve his living conditions, but later it was decided to remove them, because the creators considered that the search component of the game in this way will go the way. On April 26, 2016, the game appeared on the Kickstarter crowdfunding platform, where developers collected $25,000 to fund the game's creation. During the company, this amount was never charged and the decision was made to close the funding before the deadline. The game was also introduced on Steam Greenlight and, on May 9, reached 10th place among the projects submitted for approval by the community. During game creation, developers focused on games like Papers, Please and This War of Mine, as well as the works of George Orwell and Aldous Huxley. On October 6, 2016, the Beholder demo appeared on the Steam store. The game for personal computers was launched on November 9, 2016. On May 17, 2017, the game was released for mobile devices on iOS and Android operating systems. On January 16 and 19, 2018, the Beholder was available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, respectively. On May 18, 2017, Steam released another downloadable content called Beholder: Blissful Sleep, in which the player has the opportunity to learn more about the game world and the residents of the house. According to the supplement's plot, the government issues a bill called \\"Blessed Dream\\", which exposes all citizens who have reached the age of 85 to euthanasia. The name of the house manager is Hector Medina - he is about 65 years old, but due to an error, Hector's age has been corrected to \\"85 years old\\". The player has a choice - to submit to fate and fall asleep with a \\"blessed dream\\" or to avoid euthanasia by various methods. Unlike the original, the protagonist has no family, with the exception of the cat and his 30-year-old son, who works on the construction of a railway to the north. In additional content, the player has the opportunity to discover the story of the residents of the house that the next manager, Karl Stein, will encounter.  Reception = Awards  Beholder has been nominated and won several conference awards: * Excellence in Game Design and Best Indie Game awards at the Minsk DevGAMM Conference 2016. * Best Adventure Game @ IGN Russia * Winner in Entertainment Category @ GDWC, 2016 * Best in Play @ Game Developer Conference, GDC Play 2017 * Most Creative & Original Game, Best Indie Game @ Game Connection America, 2017 Short film Russian filmmakers Nikita Ordynskiy and Liliya Tkach released a live- action short film for Beholder, with Russian actor Evgeniy Stychkin playing the role of Carl.

Taparelli studied - and later taught - at a college in Turin and entered the Order of Preachers at Savigliano in 1441 at the San Domenico convent; he also served as the chaplain to Amadeus IX, Duke of Savoy but left his court because he was not satisfied with being there. Taparelli served as the Inquisitor-General for his order in the Lombard and Ligurian regions. He was appointed as such to replace the murdered Bartolomeo Cerveri. He organized for the relics of Antonio Pavoni to be moved to Savigliano and interred at the Dominican church there. In 1468 he became abbot of his convent and then prior of it in 1483; he was confirmed twice as the Inquisitor-General in 1483 and in 1489.

Today's settlement was established on 1 January 2015, by merging the municipalities of Dobl and Zwaring-P√∂ls.  History  Dobl was first mentioned as a \\"Tobel\\" in 1219 by Archbishop Eberhard II. from Salzburg to Sprengel, the newly established Diocese Seckau likewise. For centuries, the history of Dobl was determined by Gjaidhof Castle, which was a hunting lodge of Maria Theresa. The history of Fading dates back to a settlement in Carolingian times. Its settlement history is examined in detail.Heinrich Purkarthofer: Fading im Kainachtal. Zur Problematik und Methode siedlungsgeschichtlicher Forschung im Topographiebezirk Graz-Umgebung.

The name is derived from the prefix \\"Fadi-\\" as meaning \\"man\\" in the sense of \\"warrior, hero\\".Purkarthofer: Fading, p. 39. Names ending in \\"-ing\\" can, if added on the place or person names, in the German language area form evidence for settlements from the 7th to 9th century. The first municipalities were founded as autonomous corporations in 1850. After the annexation of Austria by Germany in 1938, the municipalities came to the Reichsgau of Styria. Between 1945 and 1955, they were part of the British occupation zone in Austria. The former municipality of P√∂ls on the Wieserbahn was acquired on January 1, 1957 from the district of Leibnitz in the Graz-Umgebung District.\\"Verordnung der steierm√§rkischen Landesregierung vom 18.

St√ºck, p. 100. The municipalities of Zwaring and P√∂ls were merged on January 1, 1968, on the proposal of the district management team of Graz-Umgebung. Both municipalities voted for the voluntary merger in October 1967, as they received a higher share of the tax revenues. There was disagreement only when the commune was established. While the congregation Zwaring and the district capital pleaded for name \\"Zwaring- P√∂ls\\", the municipality P√∂ls voiced for \\"P√∂ls-Zwaring\\" because P√∂ls was first mentioned in 1244 as the older part of the village, and there \\"Zwaring-P√∂ls\\" alphabetically stood at the end of the municipalities in the Graz-Umgebung District.http://www.zwaringpoels.at/gemchronik.php  Coat of arms  Zwaring- P√∂ls The town crests of the dissolved communities lost their official validity on January 1, 2015. left On 29 October 2015, the municipal council decided to establish the former Dobler coat of arms as the coat of arms of the new market municipality, Dobl-Zwaring. After consultation with the National Archives to create a corresponding template, the Styrian government then awarded, with order of 25 February 2016, the market town the right to use the new municipal coat of arms beginning on 10 March 2016.31\\\\.

Culture and sights = Buildings  The P√∂ls castle was first mentioned in 1244 as Zehenthof the Bishop of Salzburg. At the end of the 16th century, it was converted into a nobleman's seat, which in the later period frequently changed hands. Late 18th century, the castle eventually served as a brewery, which was however already in 1801 again closed. In 1840, the estate was owned by the Saffran family, most recently by Ludwig Freiherr von Saffran until 1855. Estate and castle were P√∂ls were acquired in 1855 by Friederike, Duchess of Oldenburg, nee Baroness from Washington to her marriage to Maximilian Emanuel von Washington, a relative of the first President of the United States, George Washington. The family commissioned the Viennese architect Moritz Wappler with basic reconstruction works, which were partly trained as \\"buildings in the Swiss township\\". A contemporary source of the \\"poultry barn\\" ... built according to the most rational principles, provided with eggs, brood and mast rooms, offers room for about 30 breeds of different chickens and pheasants, which lead their spurs to the places with low wire grids The garden side. \\"There was also a luxury horse stallion in the business area of the castle. The estate comprised of land and several hectares of leased land.Margarethe Pauly, Michael Reinbold: Friederike von Washington, Herzogin von Oldenburg (1820-1891) und ihre Familie. Eine Spurensuche in der Steiermark. Oldenburger Forschungen Neue Folge, Volume 25. Isensee-Verlag Oldenburg 2008. . p. 21‚Äì25. The P√∂ls Castle became an agricultural model enterprise under the Washington family. Maximilian von Washington was in contemporary literature as \\"one of the finest authorities of Austria in areas of agriculture and farmers\\".Zeitschrift des Landwirthschaftlichen Vereins in Bayern. Jahrgang 1868. p. 450. : The farm was a model for poultry, fish, pigs and horses, but also for working with agricultural machinery. At his coronation as King of Hungary in 1876 the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I rode on a stallion from the P√∂lser stable.Pauly, p. 25. Maximilian von Washington organized in 1863 in P√∂ls the first agricultural exhibition of Styria.Pauly, p. 27. : The complex of the castle park, whose grounds were almost bald on the acquisition in 1855, goes back to Friederike von Oldenburg, which also had exotic plants, such as this tulip tree, laciniate Beech, paulownia and other plants. In later years the focus was on poultry farming; is also documented an extensive consignments of hatching eggs within the framework.Pauly, p. 29‚Äì33. : In the years 1870-71, the manor was for family reasons in economic difficulties, but was able to recover it again, stayed in their possession until the death of Friederike von Washington on 20 March 1891, and then went to her son, George von Washington. On the occasion of his second marriage with Maria Kreuzig on November 24, 1924, George von Washington transferred all his property to his wife (with the exception of small donations to his daughter, Hubert von Hohenpriel). Maria von Washington sold the castle, together with its estate, to the family Freiherren von Allesch in 1928, which still exists today. (H. Roessmann, great-grandson of Maria von Washington). * A sight to mention is the Dobl transmitter, a medium-wave transmitter from the Second World War. The transmission tower stands as well as the broadcasting center, in which the private radio station Antenne Steiermark had its headquarters, as a historical monument.  Natural monuments  On 23 June 2003 in the park at P√∂ls, a giant spruce (or grand fir) was uprooted, which in 1856 by King I. Otto of Greece (cousin of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria - the father of Otto I and the mother of Francis Joseph Were siblings and brother-in-law of Marie Friederike von Washington), was planted together with his wife Amalie (duchess of Oldenburg and sister of Friederike von Washington), on the occasion of his visit to P√∂ls Castle, and had a height of (H. R√∂√ümann - quoted from the Upper Bavarian Archive, Volume 131).  Holy Rinn  The \\"Holy Rinn\\" is a mountain spring in a forest area in the south of the municipality. The water of this source is said to have been given special powers, since in the nineteenth century an almost blind woodsman was beginning to see better with this water by washing his eyes. The site was restored in the years 2001-02 and was consecrated on 14 August 2006 by the minister of Preding.Weststeirische Rundschau, 82. Jahrgang, Nummer 1, 3. January 2009, p. 10.

Legality Senate Bill 1014 reduces the penalties for the adult possession of up to one half-ounce of marijuana from a criminal misdemeanor (formerly punishable by one year in jail and a $1,000 fine) to a non-criminal infraction, punishable by a $150 fine, no arrest or jail time, and no criminal record. The new law similarly reduces penalties for the possession of marijuana paraphernalia. Possession of larger amounts of marijuana is still illegal and punishable by imprisonment and monetary fines. A subsequent offense of possession of one half-ounce of marijuana is still a non-criminal infraction but the fine rises to $200‚Äì500. First offense of possessing one-half to four ounces is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison and $1,000 in fine. A subsequent offense becomes a felony punishable by up to 5 years' incarceration and $3,000 fine. First offense of possession of 4 ounces or more is a felony punishable by 5 years' imprisonment and $2,000 fine. Subsequent offenses are punishable by 10 years in jail and a fine of $5,000. The minimum mandatory sentence for possession of marijuana within 1,500 feet of a school is 2 years' incarceration (without monetary fine) that runs consecutively with any other sentence. Selling any amount of marijuana is completely illegal and a felony punishable by no less than 7 years in jail and $25,000 in fine. Selling to minors and possessing within 1,500 feet of a school or day care are both felonies which adds 3 years' imprisonment to any other sentence imposed. There's no monetary fine imposed.

Although people in Cheoin had been segregated, they fought and beat the Mongols. Background In August 1232, the Mongol Empire started to invade Goryeo for the second time after defeating Gaegyeong and Hanyang. They advanced onto Gwangju in November but lost. Saritai, who was the Mongolian commander, decided to make a detour. He ordered the most of the army to advance to Ganghwado and he continued moving south with the rest of his army until they arrived at Cheoin. Cheoin was one of the Bugok where segregated people were living together and the earthen fortification with about 425 m circumference. Cheoin had a storage of provisions. Sartai got ready to besiege by occupying around Cheoin. Development There were about 1,000 refugees and 100 monk soldiers, including Kim Yun-hu. On December 16, 1232, Saritai split and allocated the forces surrounding Cheoin. People in Cheoin decided to fight against the Mongols and nominated Kim Yun-hu as a commander. The Mongol force attacked under the command of Sartai. The Goryeo force that had been waiting on a hill outside of the East gate ambushed the Mongols. Sartai was killed by a missed arrow shot by Kim Yun-hu. As the commander died, the Mongols collapsed and the Goryeo force defeated the Mongols completely. Aftermath The Mongol Empire was shocked by Saritai's death. Although the war had been favorable for the Mongols, the war turned in Goryeo's favor. The Mongol Empire concluded a peace treaty with Goryeo and withdrew its troops. The Goryeo government promoted Kim Yun-hu's position in admiration of his achievement, but Kim declined. Cheoin bugok was promoted to Hyeon.

It examines and documents the democracy of modern India, drawing attention to corruption in both business and government, and the intertwining of money and muscle power in politics .  Summary  A Feast of Vultures is a multi-level inquiry into the Indian government, which examines, investigates and analyzes several major political scandals and highlights evidence of corruption against some of the country's largest political and business figures and houses. The book places particular focus on government-affiliated individuals who conduct business through their personal connections, resulting in what it argues are some of the country's largest business monopolies. This corruption is illustrated through examples of needs: a village needs a road and a hospital, a graveyard that needs a wall, and people that need toilets. In addition, the book describes the ways individuals navigated their business and how the government meets those needs. The book examines the role of intermediaries in the Indian political scenario and how they function in the government settings. The book contrasts the lives of the anonymous poor with those of the rich and famous, and how the wealth gap undermines democratic processes. It reports on the flourishing phenomenon of middlemen who facilitate access to decision makers and manipulate government decisions. It is suggested that \\"a whole caste of middlemen\\" sustains and perpetuates corruption in India. It is prevalent from the lowest police post to the offices of the prime minister and president. A particular segment of the economy is examined to show how democratic institutions are easily manipulated by ambitious and well-funded businessmen, who seek preferential treatment directly or through intermediaries including organized crime figures. Through a detailed investigation, the author provides his own evidence, arguing that some of modern India's most successful entrepreneurs have thrived through bribes, manipulation, and possibly even murder. In the final segment of the book, Joseph argues that India's elite are the beneficiaries of corruption, using their financial and political clout to steer policy-making and legislation.. The elite are described as 'puppet masters' who straddle political and economic power, unencumbered by either democratic accountability or regulatory oversight.  Conception and writing  Joseph has described his book as \\"an angst-ridden narrative on the distortion of our democracy.\\" Rohan Venkataramakrishnan of Scroll.in stated that Joseph sought to cover stories which were untold due to concerns of litigation. Joseph said in an interview with the news site that he had observed unprecedented self-censorship by reporters, implying that they and their publishers were fearful of legal action. He said that journalists had thus \\"forgotten our duty and become lapdogs of the establishment.\\" Joseph said that A Feast of Vultures was his first effort in uncensored journalism of modern India.  Cover  The cover of A Feast of Vultures combines two images: a Corbis / Getty Images photograph of the bed of a farmer who committed suicide, his photograph propped up against a pillow, with a background of skyscrapers.  Interviews  In an interview with Rohan Venkataramakrishnan for Scroll.in, Joseph said: *\\"I'm the father of a 13-year- old girl. I would rather set an example for her than let my friends in the industry be happy or be scared of someone. I'm ready for it, if there is any litigation, I think it would be a great fight to have\\". *\\"Very honestly, I've been in Delhi for 25 years, and I've never seen this level of self-censorship in public discourse, ever. The worst is the self-censorship that reporters are subjecting themselves to, and the distortion of facts. I hope it's a short- lived phenomenon. In a young country like ours, you cannot suppress dissent. At least not forever.\\" *\\"It's an embarrassing thing for journalists, though. We've forgotten our duty and become lapdogs of the establishment. Some of us will have to stand up and fight, and be firm about values. It is when we stand up, then things will change.\\" In an interview with Preetha Nair for TheNewsMinute.com, Joseph said: *\\"It is a coincidence that my book comes at a time when we are celebrating 25 years of liberalisation and 70 years of independence. A lot of us born in the socialist era have come to believe that middlemen are part of our system. Liberalisation has given a fillip to middlemen and they've grown a hundred times. If you get the right middleman, you can even buy a government. My book is an angst-ridden narrative on the distortion of our democracy\\". *\\"One of the fundamental flaws in our system is that Indian politics sucks in a lot of black money and our corporates are forced to feed the political class. If we can bring transparency in political funding, that itself will diminish corruption\\". In an interview with Syed Firdaus Ashraf for Rediff.com, Joseph said: *\\"As reporters, we are always dealing with a tiny bit of a large puzzle. We are also hamstrung by space limitations, various kinds of censorships imposed by corporate, political and such interests as well as other restrictions. I wanted to report and interpret modern India without any self-censorship, varnishing or any other considerations. A Feast Of Vultures is my first step in this direction\\".  Reception = Critical reviews  Reviews of the book were largely positive. Harish Khare, editor of The Tribune, called it \\"an irritatingly brilliant book [told] with considerable competence and style.\\" He further described it as a sobering and condemning view absent from newspapers. Rishi Raj of The Financial Express agreed that the realistic viewpoint was rarely seen in journalism or academic works, and recommended it to analysts and those interested in an uncompromising look at post-independence India. Soutik Biswas of OPEN magazine called it \\"an ambitious inquiry of what ails India [...] Part memoir, part reportage and part polemic\\". Aditya Sinha of Mint stated that it was \\"meticulously researched and intelligently written\\" and \\"reads like a thriller\\". Namrata Biji Ahuja of The Week called it a \\"fascinating tale of modern India and its journey as a liberal economy\\" and a call to action against \\"the business-as-usual approach which allows crony capitalism, scandals and scams.\\"  Awards  In January 2018, A Feast of Vultures was named the best book of 2017 by the jury in the non-fiction category of the Crossword Book Award. Competing entries included books by Amitav Ghosh, Pradeep Damodaran, Pankaj Mishra and Shashi Tharoor.

Most of the border is formed by the river Songwe, whose source is found in the mountains to the south-west of Mount Rungwe and the town of Tukuyu. The Songwe is fast-flowing and changes its course regularly in a short period of time, forming new meanders and causing the precise border location to shift and become ambiguous. A dam is currently being constructed to regulate the river's flow. The border follows the Songwe into Lake Malawi, where it meets the tripoint between Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania. The border at Malawi Lake is disputed, as are the rights to the lake. Following the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty of 1890, the two colonial powers, the United Kingdom (for Nyasaland, which later became Malawi) and Germany (for Tanganyika, which later became Tanzania) agreed that the border would follow the Tanzanian shore of the lake.

It was originally developed for engineers who considered using the ŒºCOM-80 family in their product. It was successful among hobbyists in late 1970s in Japan, due to its reasonable price and an expensive computer terminal not being required.  History  In February 1976, NEC formed the Microcomputer Sales section in the Integrated Circuit division, and began to provide development environments for their microprocessors. However, they visited customers and explained, but it was difficult for them to understand how to use a microprocessor. At the same time, NEC received an order from a laboratory in the Yokosuka Communication Institute of NTT that they wanted an educational microcomputer product for their new employees. , a member of the section, proposed to his manager developing an educational kit. Goto mainly designed the TK-80, and did the detailed design work. Goto got an idea from a photo of the KIM-1. The KIM-1 can monitor and show the current address by the software, but the display disappears when the CPU is hanging. The TK-80 has the Dynamic Display using the 555 timer IC and interrupt the CPU, it can always show the current address. In addition, the TK-80 has a CMOS battery. He decided to document its manual with a circuit diagram and assembly code of the debug monitor, influenced by the PDP-8 which was an open architecture and was used as an IC tester at NEC. TK-80 demonstrated controlling a model train at Bit-INN Advert in Transistor Gijutsu Sep.1976. \\"The closest microcomputer with unlimited potential.\\" The price includes shipping cost. The TK-80 came out on August 3, 1976. It was priced at 88,500 yen, an engineer's section manager could approve at that time. NEC had opened a support center (Bit-INN) at the Akihabara Radio Kaikan on September 13, 1976. They found many machines were sold to not only electrical engineers but also businessmen, hobbyists and students. The TK-80 was sold more than 2000 units per month, despite 200 units expected. Soon after its success, other Japanese microprocessor manufacturers developed an evaluation kit for their microprocessor. Power supplies and other peripherals came out from third parties. Watanabe and his members wrote an introductory book in July 1977, it became very popular and sold more than 200,000 copies. Also, some computer magazines were founded, the ASCII, the I/O, the and the RAM. In Japan, the Altair 8800 was sold in 1975, but not successful due to its high brokerage fee. Neither the Apple II nor the Commodore PET. Single-board computers had been popular until the successor PC-8001 came out in 1979.  Variants  The TK-80E was a cost-reduced version priced at 67,000 yen, introduced in December 1977. It contained the NEC ŒºPD8080AF (2 MHz), fully compatible with the Intel 8080A. (The original ŒºPD8080A has an incompatibility in the BCD adjustment, the ŒºPD8080AF does not.). Other specifications included 768 B (Max. Up to 1 KB expandable) of ROM, and 512 B (Max. Up to 1 KB expandable) of RAM. The TK-80BS was introduced in December 1977. It included a keyboard, a backplane and an expansion board for the TK-80 with 5KB RAM and 12KB ROM. It supported 8K BASIC. The COMPO BS/80 was a fully assembled unit of the TK-80BS, introduced in 1978. It was not a success because of its poor built-in BASIC and slow clock speed. The TK-85 was introduced in May 1980 and was the successor to the TK-80E. It contained the ŒºPD8085AC processor (2.4576 MHz) and has a system configuration that is considered to some extent for compatibility with the TK-80. Other specifications included 2 KB (Max. Up to 8 KB expandable) of ROM, 1 KB of RAM, while the board size was 310 √ó 220 mm. It supported BASIC. The PDA-80 was a development platform for NEC's microprocessors. It had the ŒºPD8080A processor, 8 KB of RAM, a teleprinter interface and a self assembler for its processor.  Literature    References  External links   (Japanese language) * (Japanese language.

It is now sited within a pastoral lease. Ecology Manankurra stands on the eastern bank of a bend in the Wearyan River. It is called a wirrimalaru (big place), thickly planted with a variety of white-barked eucalyptus, and with an Australian species of cycad palm trees, which had an important ritual function in indigenous lifestyle and cultural beliefs. Ritual function The Yanyuwa and Garrwa tribes would gather at Manankurra to perform ceremonies connected with a creation myth, whose dreamtime centre concerned the figure of the tiger shark, around whom a songline cycle (kujika) was chanted. European settlement European settlement began in 1918, with the establishment of a salt-production plant on the site, and continued until its closure in 1941. The factory was a source of income for many aborigines who were attracted to the area for seasonal employment after their dispersal from their native grounds, and a large Yanyuwa camp was established nearby, at Liwurriya for that reason. In 1964 the area inclusive of Manankurra was enveloped within a pastoral lease. The Yanyuwa and Garrwa peoples claimed a special entitlement to the old ritual ground, which they desired to be excised from the lease to enable them to restore their management of the ceremonial landscape, a claim they underwrote by a journey, which was the subject of a film,Buwarrala Akarriya, (Jurney East) which took place from Borroloola to Manankarra in 1988.

The book also speaks to Gibson‚Äôs increasing frustrations with writing and rewriting to please an audience and his production team, as well as what seemed, for Gibson, the achingly hollow victory of the play‚Äôs terrific commercial success. It also recounts the thrill of discovering and casting Anne Bancroft in what was her star-making role as the coarse, ethnic (Jewish) Gittel Mosca, with her irresistible gamine charm and her enormous emotional range, warmth, and wit.

Finals Number 1 seed UE only has to win once, while number 2 seed UP has to win twice, to clinch the championship. *Most Valuable Player: Eric Altamirano () After 47 years of frustration, the State University, which is more famous for producing personalities from the various spectrum of the society, finally made a name for itself in the field of varsity basketball. After five years of bench bitterness, Lipa, the new miracle man of amateur caging, realized an elusive dream which had slipped from his hand twice in the last five years. The dying seconds of the winner-take-all UP-University of the East clash seemed a lifetime for Lipa, the players and the throngs of pro- Maroons crowd. The UP lead was already insurmountable, yet in everyone's mind was the wounds of the 1983 championship to Far Eastern University. The fans were kept at the edge of their seats by the last ditch, desperate fullcourt press by the dethroned Warriors, proud owners of 18 UAAP titles. A pocket of UP supporters at the gallery were undecided whether to unfurl the championship streamer or not. The Maroons were leading FEU in 1983, only to lose by a slim margin. Finally, the final horn blared and all frustrations were erased.

Taxonomy Although discovered in 1982 by Ray Leggett,Unmack PJ (2016) Fishes of Sahul, 30(3): 1025‚Äì1032 (September 2016) the species was never formally described as its taxonomy was unclear.Unmack PJ and Hammer MP (2015) Fishes of Sahul, 29(4): 933‚Äì936 (December 2015) However, genetic analysis supports the Running River rainbowfish as a distinct species, rather than a colour variety of the eastern rainbowfish. Conservation In the wild, the Running River rainbowfish is confined to a 13 km stretch of Running River, isolated between two gorges. In August 2015, ecologists Peter Unmack and Michael Hammer discovered that eastern rainbowfish had been introduced into the upper section of Running River, and were hybridising and introgressing with the Running River rainbowfish.Katsis A (2016) \\"Watered down\\" Lateral magazine, 7 November 2016. Due to this hybridisation threat, the Australian Society for Fish Biology listed the Running River rainbowfish as critically endangered in September 2016. In August 2015, researchers from the University of Canberra and James Cook University began a captive breeding program using 'pure' Running River rainbowfish captured from the wild. By September 2016, they had bred about 3000 individuals. These captive-bred fish are being released into two nearby tributaries, Deception Creek and Puzzle Creek, beginning in November 2016.

It is an erect shrub with crowded, strongly aromatic leaves and white to bright pink flowers in late winter and spring. Description Boronia deanei is an erect, glabrous shrub which grows to a height of and has slightly angled branches with scattered small warts. The leaves are divided into narrow, paired leaflets which are thick, strongly aromatic, linear in shape, long and wide. They are smooth on the upper surface but glandular-warty on the lower side. The flowers are arranged near the ends of the branches in groups of up to three, each flower on a stalk long. The petals are white to bright pink, long with their edges overlapping. There are eight stamens with glabrous filaments. Flowering occurs between August and November and the fruit is present in December. Taxonomy and naming Boronia deanei was first formally described in 1907 by Joseph Maiden and Ernst Betche from a specimen collected by Henry Deane in the Blue Mountains. The description was published in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. The specific epithet (deanei) honours the collector of the type specimen. In 2002, Marco Duretto described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: *Boronia deanei subsp. deanei which has leaflets with a blunt tip; *Boronia deanei subsp. acutifolia which has leaflets with a pointed tip. Distribution and habitat This boronia mainly occurs in the higher Blue Mountains north of Clarence, in the Kanangra-Boyd National Park and south to the South East Forests National Park. It grows near high altitude swamps, in wet heath and in open forest, often in poorly-drained soil. Conservation Boronia deanei is listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act and under the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. The main threats to its survival are habitat disturbance due to feral pigs (Sus scrofa) and clearing for rural residential developments. Use in horticulture Deane's boronia is a reliable and adaptable garden plant which can be grown in poorly-drained soils and is relatively frost-hardy. Its pleasantly scented leaves and pink flowers are attractive features. Specimens have been grown in pots and in the Australian National Botanic Gardens have grown to a height of , needing only tip pruning, occasional fertilising and adequate summer watering.

He was the first scholar who wrote a history of his town providing documentary evidence on it.  Biography  Ignazio De Blasi was born in Alcamo in 1717, the son of Benedetto de Blasi, a notary, and his wife Francesca Puglisi. He was awarded the degree of Duty and Laws at the University of Catania in 1741, and on 19 April 1746 he married Angela Manfr√®, who bore him a daughter, Maria Anna. He died in 1783 in Alcamo, and was buried in the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi. Wishing to publish his difficult historical research, he was admitted into the group of the Academy of the Good Taste of Alcamo in 1746.F.M. Mirabella: Memorie Biografiche Alcamesi p.179-180; Alcamo, tip. Segesta e figli, 1924 He wrote the history even as he was engaged with the administration of the municipality and of various charities, together with his public teaching activity at the Jesuits' college. Works The complete work of Ignazio De Blasi is collected in a volume of 1900 pages entitled: Discorso storico della opulenta citt√† di Alcamo situata a pi√® del Monte Bonifato, e dell'antichissima citt√† di Longarico ossia Lacarico, dopo detta Alcamo, su di esso monte. De Blasi examined the memories of three priests from Alcamo: Cammarata, Zappante and Cossentino; consulted all the documents of the archives of parishes, of the town archives and of the dead notaries, whose keeper was his father. So, thanks to his tireless hard work, he completed a volume containing 1900 pages. Since the dedication and introduction of the book, it is clear that the author believed that he had entirely maintained his hard commitment; actually the manuscript is an orderly collection of information, divided into 48 chapters, about the coat of arms, the mount and its neighbouring rivers, the origin, the domains, the territory, churches, nunneries, friaries and all charities, famous people, privileges and other memorable things of the town. At about 1780, De Blasi wrote the earliest known description of the archaeological site on Mount Bonifato, reporting some information about two Latin inscriptions (of doubtful origin) and an Arab coin.http://www.drepanon.org/Bonifato005.pdf Even if it is full of unacceptable mistakes and assumptions, some repetitions and a poor style, it is a very important work, both for the richness of the subject and for the abundance of documents which contains, such as: privileges, taxes, customs and other old deeds taken from the Red Book and from the documents of the municipality (= court giuratoria): both of them are not existing any longer owing to the fire during the rebel movements taking place in Sicily in 1820. This work is a unique historical heritage because it is a manuscript; it is the most important and rich historical work existing about the town of Alcamo, as many sources (previously present in the civic archives) used by De Blasi, have got lost.F.M. Mirabella: Cenni degli alcamesi rinomati in lettere, arti, armi e santit√†; Alcamo, tip. Gaetano Surdi, 1876 In the course of time many scholars and historians from Alcamo have mentioned his work, which is of primary importance because it gives a lot of information about the foundation of religious buildings and institutions, among which the Confraternities existing in Alcamo. Manuscript For 17 years the manuscript, nearly all autograph, remained in the heirs‚Äô hands, that is Angela Manfr√®, his widow, and the daughter but in 1800 they donated it to the town archives; in exchange for it, they received a life annuity of 20 uncias each. This decree, approved by scrupulous and grateful administrators, has both given a great and important work to the town, and a benefit to De Blasi's members of family. On 23 October 1800, by an act of public authority at the notary Giovanni Coppola, the volume, was temporarily entrusted to the representative of the municipality dottor Antonio Mangione, in order to use it in an action against the Royal State ownership. Later it was deposited in the town archives and they had another copy written, but it has remained without the last five chapters. Today, both the authentic manuscript and the incomplete copy, are in the Civic Library Sebastiano Bagolino; in 1875 the town council deliberated the publication of De Blasi's work at the municipality‚Äôs expense  See also  * Mount Bonifato * Small Church of Saint Anne (Alcamo) * San Giacomo della Spada, Alcamo * Church of Saint Nicholas of Bari (Alcamo)  References Sources *F.M.

The poem is dedicated to the ruler of Tabas, Yamƒ´n al-Dowla (aka ·∏§isƒÅm ad-Dƒ´n Yamƒ´n ad-Dowla Shams al-Ma‚ÄòƒÅlƒ´ Ab≈´ ‚Äôl-Mu·∫ìaffar Amƒ´r IsmƒÅ‚Äòƒ´l Gƒ´lakƒ´, and can be read as a 'letter of application' demonstrating MukhtƒÅrƒ´'s skill as a court poet.J.

Tetley, The Ghaznavid and Seljuk Turks: Poetry as a Source for Iranian History (Abingdon: Routledge, 2009), p. 138. The poem is unique among mathnavƒ´s for portraying a young poet being tested, not by a more senior poet as in other medieval Persian poems, but by an astrologer. Moreover, is also unique for including a series of riddles (ten in all) on the spiritual, intellectual, and military ideals for a king.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), p. 150. These in turn have a distinctive structure: each has ten distichs posing ethical questions, followed by two distichs in which the poet delivers his answers.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 28-29. The riddles in particular serve to showcase MukhtƒÅrƒ´'s virtuosity in poetic description. The poem is also among the earliest to have been written in the khafƒ´f metre.Asghar Seyed-Gohrab, 'A Mystical Reading of NizƒÅmƒ´‚Äôs Use of Nature in the Haft Paykar‚Äô, in A Key to the Treasure of the Hakƒ´m: Artistic and Humanistic Aspects of NizƒÅmƒ´ Ganjavƒ´‚Äôs ‚ÄòKhamsa‚Äô, ed. by Johann-Christoph B√ºrgel and Christine van Ruymbeke (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2011), pp. 181-93 (at p. 188). Contents The poem begins of a cosmological survey, which descends from heaven to earth before culminating in praise of God and his Prophet. The second half of the poem narrates the reverse process: the striving of the poet's persona to proceed from a mundane existence to spiritual perfection.

He worked for nearly five years as a reporter and producer for Univision Investiga, a department managed by the Pulitzer Prize winner Gerardo Reyes. Together they uncovered cases of corruption, drug trafficking, labor exploitation, fraud, gun trafficking and environmental destruction, visiting a dozen countries in order to make it possible. He has also been involved in some of the most important global investigations such as Panama Papers or Swissleaks. In 2015 Tomas was appointed to represent his country, Spain, as ambassador of the project ¬¥Made of talent¬¥.  Career  With a degree in both Law and Journalism at the Carlos III University, he began his career at CNN + / Cuatro, to eventually become the executive producer of 'El Telediario de Intereconomia'. In January 2012 Oca√±a arrives at Univision to join the newly created Documentaries department. His first production was 'PRESSured' a documentary co-directed with Mariana Atencio about press freedom in Latin America, which was recognized in 2014 with the Gracie Award from the Alliance for Women in Media After a short stay in this department, he was promoted to work as a reporter and producer at Univision Investiga, the newly created investigative department of the network led by the colombian journalist Gerardo Reyes. Between 2012 and 2016, Ocana has produced investigative reports in Spain, United States, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Dominican Republic, Peru, Colombia, Panama and Germany. Among the most relevant assignments of Univision Investiga is the outstanding work on how the Mexican trafficker Joaquin \\"El Chapo\\" Guzman forged his drug empire. Four months before the capture of Guzman in 2014 (there would be a new capture in 2016 following the escape of the prisoner in 2015), Univision broadcast a special report called 'El Chapo Guzman, the eternal fugitive'. This report meant an international recognition for both the team and the network for broadcasting the first in-depth approach to the insights of the world's most powerful drug trafficker. In 2014, the documentary obtained the Emmy Award for the best investigative journalism in Spanish. Tomas was a finalist for the Livingston Awards, which recognizes the work of journalists under 35. Another of Tomas‚Äôs investigative awarded special report was 'Fast and Furious, arming the enemy', which got him a Peabody Award, the first prize of the IRE (Investigative Reporters and Editors) and the second place in the National Headliner Award. This special report located the whereabouts of dozens of weapons from the operation led by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The United States Congress requested Univision Investiga the data from the report for analysis in the internal investigation of the camera on this operation. In 'Los nuevos Narcotesoros', Univision Investiga explored the criminal activities undertaken by the drug cartels in order to identify their sources of income. That includes the smuggling of undocumented immigrants, forced prostitution, kidnapping, extortion, theft of fuel and mining illicit minerals like gold and iron, which was uncovered as the most profitable of all. Thanks to this work, for the second consecutive year, Univision Investiga won the Emmy Award for best investigative journalism in Spanish. The multimedia version of this project won the Ortega y Gasset Journalism Award. Oca√±a and the Univision Investiga team achieved that same year a second statuette at the 36th Emmy Awards as part of the Univision News team who covered the murder of the 43 Mexican students killed in Iguala. The job was awarded in the 'Outstanding Coverage of a breaking news story in Spanish' category. In 2016, the report 'Tall Tale' won the National Journalism Award in Mexico, by unclogging the political-business intricacies of the largest cash seizure in world history: US$205 million. The work was conducted by Univision Investiga and the Investigative Reporting Program at Berkeley University. This joint research was nominated in the 37th edition of the Emmy Awards, a gala in which Tomas had two other nominations.

He was known for his elucidation of the Quantum Mechanical Model of Robert S. Mulliken and his article, Degree of Polymerization and Chain Transfer in Methyl Methacrylate, co-authored by Jyotirindra Nath Sen and Santi R. Palit was the first published Indian article on polymer chemistry. He was an elected fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, Chemical Society of France, Indian Chemical Society, Indian National Science Academy and the Indian Academy of Sciences. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1962, for his contributions to chemical sciences.  Biography  Basu was born on 2 January 1922 in Kolkata (then Calcutta), to Jyotish Chandra Basu and Sarajubala. Educated in the city, he graduated with a B.Sc. from the University of Calcutta in 1942, obtaining an M.Sc. from the same university in Rajabazar Science College campus in 1944. He then conducted research into the properties of shellac at the Indian Lac Research Institute (now the Indian Institute of Natural Resins and Gums) under the supervision of noted chemist Prafulla Kumar Bose (1898-1983), for which he earned a D.Sc. from Rajabazar Science College, Calcutta University in 1948. In 1948, Basu joined the faculty of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, where he conducted pioneering research on chain transfer in radical polymerisation and established a standard procedure for estimating the molecular weight of polymers. From 1951 to 1953, he was a postdoctoral Fulbright fellow in chemistry at Indiana University Bloomington, where he developed an interest in the emerging field of quantum chemistry; upon returning to India, he published six papers on free electron molecular orbital calculations. In 1954, Basu joined the faculty of the University of Calcutta as a reader; he would remain at the university for the next three decades. One of the pioneers of polymer chemistry in India, his studies were primarily in the fields of charge transfer interactions, ligand field spectra, hydrogen bonding, quantum chemistry and photochemistry. Focusing on the detection, and analysis of charge transfer band of molecular complexes and through experimental assignment of its vibrational structure, he supported the quantum mechanical model of the complexes originally propounded by Robert S. Mulliken, the winner of 1966 Nobel Prize for Chemistry. In order to determine the -NH2 group in nylon, he developed a methodology which has since been accepted as a standard industrial procedure. He calculated the transition energies and oscillator strengths of aromatic polyhydrocarbons using the gas model prescribed by Shin'ichir≈ç Tomonaga in 1950, demonstrated that extended catacondensed planar structures could be derived only by using 3-4-6 membered rings and employing Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov, illustrated that, unlike triplet transitions, the longest wavelength singlet transitions in linear polyenes converge to a limit. Basu's researches were published in a number of articles and the article, Degree of Polymerization and Chain Transfer in Methyl Methacrylate, he and his co-authors, J. N. Sen and S. R. Palit, published in 1950 was the first Indian article on polymer chemistry. He was associated with International Journal of Quantum Chemistry, the Indian Journal of Chemistry and the Proceedings of the Proceedings of Indian National Science Academy as their associate editor and mentored a number of students in their doctoral researches. During 1961-62, Basu was a visiting professor at Indiana University Bloomington and was subsequently (1962‚Äì63) a visiting professor in the quantum chemistry group at the University of Uppsala. Following his return to India, Basu was appointed to the Palit Professorship of Chemistry at the Rajabazar Science College or University College of Science & Technology in 1964, the chair of which he held until his superannuation and retirement. He also served as head of the university's chemistry department from 1978 to 1980. In 1981, he was appointed the director of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, but relinquished the post in 1982 due to ill health. He also served the Indian National Science Academy council during 1982-84 as a member. Basu retired from the University of Calcutta in 1985, and died on 5 October 1992, at the age of 70. He was survived by his wife, Rama Basu, who was also a theoretical chemist, and their son and daughter. His scientific contributions have been documented in an article, Sadhan Basu ‚Äî a physical chemist extraordinaire, published in Resonance journal in 2013.  Awards and honors  The Indian National Science Academy elected Basu as a fellow in 1962 and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1965. A UGC National Professor during 1972‚Äì73, he became an elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences in 1975 and was a recipient of the Acharya J. C. Ghosh Gold Medal of Indian Chemical Society (1984) and the C. V. Raman Birth Centenary Commemoration Medal of the Indian Science Congress Association (1988). In 1957, he was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Institute of Chemistry (FRIC), which merged with the Chemical Society in 1980 to become the Royal Society for Chemistry. He was also a fellow of the Indian Chemical Society and the Society of Physical Chemistry of France. The Indian Academy of Sciences issued a festschrift, Dedicated to Prof. Sadhan Basu on the occasion of his sixtyfifth birthday, on him in 1986 on his 65th birth anniversary and the contributors included Jack Simons, Debashis Mukherjee, Werner Kutzelnigg and George G. Hall among others. The Indian National Science Academy has instituted an annual oration, Professor Sadhan Basu Memorial Lecture in his honor and the University of Kolkata recognizes excellence in research in chemistry each year by an annual award, Professor Sadhan Basu Memorial Award.

Built in 1898, the building houses a nearly intact water-powered grain grinding mechanism from the period. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Description and history The Old Red Mill stands at the northern edge of the village of South Northfield, at the southwest corner of Vermont Route 12 with Lovers Lane. It is set between Route 12 and Sunny Brook, a branch of the Dog River which was the source of its power. It is a single-story wood-frame structure, with a gabled roof and vertical board siding. It is set on a foundation of slate, and has two additions extending away from the brook and toward the road. The first has a higher gabled roof and is capped by a cupola, while the second has a shed roof. The mill received its water power via a concrete dam and penstock, which direct water into a metal turbine. The turbine powers the main drive shaft, from which power was transferred to other devices via leather or rubberized canvas belts. Surviving equipment includes conveyor belts and grain cleaning and milling equipment. with Mills have existed on this site since at least the early 19th century. This mill was built as a replacement for one that burned in 1896 by M.W. Partch in 1897-98. The gristmill operated until the mid-1940s, and was joined in the building by a cider mill in the 1930s.

The film depicts the life of painter and rock-'n-roll musician Herman Brood and premiered at the IDFA in Amsterdam. The film was nominated for Best Dutch Documentary and has been released in cinemas by distributor Amstel Film. Synopsis On Wednesday the 11th of July, 2001, Herman Brood commits suicide by jumping off the roof of the Hilton hotel. In his personal videos, song lyrics and interviews Brood has left a trail of breadcrumbs pertaining to the questions his death has given rise to. The documentary takes a look back to re-experience these important moments with the help of these never-before-seen footages and the people that stood closest to him. Production The filmmakers started this project without any budget and it took them four years to make. Before shooting began cinematographer Thomas van der Gronde and director Dennis Alink experimented with a new documentary-approach by writing a 50-page script and a graphic film-plan in which archive and new to shoot scenes would fuse. This way the locations and lighting of interviews would change and develop every other scene to complement the state of mind of Herman Brood. Eventually a small budget was raised through crowdfunding and after the film was edited the Netherlands Film Fund and KPN stepped in so the film could be completed.

Plot The day after the 2016 United States presidential election, people are shocked that Mr. Garrison has defeated Hillary Clinton, especially Randy Marsh. In contrast to his earlier actions, Garrison in a dazed speech embraces his election. Randy visits Garrison and his running mate Caitlyn Jenner to confront their changed attitude and their changed belief that Star Wars: The Force Awakens was not a bad movie when Jenner suddenly vomits a member berry-based substance onto Randy, causing him to fall into the same dazed state of acceptance. Later at his home, Randy vomits on Sharon and Shelly, bringing them into the same state. The city of Fort Collins, Colorado, has not had their election votes tallied as they are walled off due to the city's entire Internet histories being published from the Danish website known as Troll Trace.

He is led under a bridge where he meets with Hillary Clinton. Hillary and her agents task Gerald to become a spy and infiltrate Troll Trace headquarters in Denmark as an ambassador with a briefcase that would emit an electromagnetic pulse, destroying their computer equipment. When Gerald arrives in Denmark, he is warmly welcomed to the Troll Trace headquarters and taken to a room he believes is the server room only to be surprised by meeting his Internet troll friend Dildo Schwaggins and the rest of his trolling team. Schwaggins reveals that they were all set up by Hillary to be fake spies and purposefully given to the Danes in return for Denmark not activating the Troll Trace website. Their briefcases then simultaneously all open to reveal that they have been rickrolled. Cartman is scared that his girlfriend Heidi Turner will find out about his previous Internet history, so he asks Butters to help him cover up his previous Internet actions, but Butters is still mad at Cartman and the girls. Later, PC Principal hosts a school assembly with Bill Clinton who also brings along Bill Cosby to introduce a new gentlemen's club in hopes that the boys and girls of the school can get along. Bill Clinton has Stan and Wendy Testaburger try to make up but Butters interrupts their session by pressing his penis against the window. Bill Clinton later meets with Butters and reveals to him that this gentlemen's club is only an act to avoid the wrath of Hillary and the rest of the women when their Internet histories are revealed by Troll Trace.

Production This episode was originally going to be titled \\"The Very First Gentleman\\"; however, the title and a large amount of the content was changed at the last minute to reflect the results of the 2016 United States presidential election. Critics seemed to believe that Trey Parker and Matt Stone had originally written the episode with the premise of Hillary Clinton winning the election, which the pair later confirmed. The original broadcast of the episode also left the first uncensored usage of the word \\"fucking\\" in the series' history. Reception Many of the critical reviews focused on the changes the episode had to incorporate due to the election results.

In Argentina The genre was first introduced in the country in 1994 by Perdona nuestros pecados, a comedy by Ra√∫l Portal. The program highlighted the mistakes and faulty productions seen in other programs. The genre was later picked up by talk shows, that air a portion of an event that took place at some other program, which is then discussed by the people in the studios. Other programs do not employ debate, and work instead as news programs of the events that took place in the television itself. Political programs such as Intratables use a similar format to the talk shows, but focused on politics- related events. Others like 6, 7, 8 and Televisi√≥n Registrada highlight contradictions between modern events and things that the involved politicians may have said in the past; this use was criticized because it usually forced seemed contradictions by using phrases from out of context for shocking value.

It consisted of a launcher containing thousands of spin-stabilized unguided rockets that would be fired into the path of an enemy nuclear warhead, enough that it would be highly likely one of the rockets would hit the warhead and destroy it. The concept worked in concert with the Multiple Protective Shelter basing for the MX missile. MPS proposed making about two dozen missile silos for each MX missile, moving the missile between them at random so the Soviets would not know where they were. With a force of 200 missiles and 4,600 silos, the Soviets would have to use up the majority of their warheads ensuring each MX was hit, with the vast majority of those warheads falling on empty silos. The number of warheads needed could be doubled with a Swarmjet system. Because the US knew where the MX was, and the Soviets did not, they could choose to shoot down the single warhead approaching the current location of the MX and ignore the rest. To ensure the MX was destroyed in this case, the Soviets would have to aim two warheads at each silo. With 4,600 silos, the attack would require 9,200 warheads, much more than they had or were allowed under the SALT treaty. This idea of \\"multiplication\\" was originally developed as part of the similar LoADS ABM. The LoADS, along with its radars and computers, would be installed in a canister that fit inside an MX missile silo. It was possible such a system could not be built that small, and Swarmjet was proposed as a low-cost alternative. When MPS was dropped and Dense Pack chosen in 1982, the entire concept no longer worked ‚Äì the base could be targeted with a small number of warheads, so shooting down one warhead no longer helped. Swarmjet was offered as a way to shoot down multiple warheads over a short period of time, but very little development along these lines was carried out.  Background = MX  Since the late 1950s, the US Air Force had faced the possibility that the nuclear deterrence role would be handed to the US Navy's Polaris missile fleet. Unlike the Air Force's strategic bombers and ICBMs, the Polaris missiles were essentially invulnerable. As the key concept in deterrence is the assurance that any attack will be met with a counterattack, Polaris was the best way to meet that goal. RAND Corporation wrote a February 1960 report on this called \\"The Puzzle of Polaris\\" which was a serious concern to Air Force planners. Their solution was to re-align the ICBM fleet not as a counterstrike weapon, but specifically as a way to attack any Soviet missiles still left in the ground. Polaris simply did not have the accuracy needed to attack a missile silo, whereas the latest Minuteman missile could do so with some relatively minor upgrades. However, this would require the Minuteman fleet to survive a Soviet sneak attack, and this was a serious concern as Soviet missile technology improved. It was believed that by the late 1970s or early 1980s, the Soviets would be able to destroy as much as 90% of the Air Force fleet while expending only of their own ICBM fleet. In response, the Air Force began development of the MX missile with the explicit intent of making a force that would survive a sneak attack with enough numbers to counterattack the Soviet silos. After much deliberation, the Multiple Protective Shelters, MPS, was selected for deployment. In MPS, each MX would be based in a cell of 23 silos, spaced far enough apart that each silo would have to be attacked independently. The other silos would be filled with decoy missiles, and the single MX would be randomly moved about the cell. A total force of 200 missiles in 4,600 silos would require 4,600 warheads to attack, from a Soviet fleet of 5,928 warheads. This would not ensure MX's survival, but make it so expensive to defeat that it would place the US and Soviets on roughly equal footing after the attack. MPS could be further improved simply by building more shelters. With 5,500 shelters, over half of the fleet would survive. However, the 4,600 silo deployment already took up a significant portion of the states of Nevada and Utah, finding more space would be difficult.  LoADS  The US Army had been investigating ABM systems since the 1950s, briefly deploying Safeguard in the 1970s. As part of this research, ARPA had noticed that when used as a defensive system, ABMs had a distinct advantage. As the enemy warhead had to fall quite close to a missile silo to destroy it, and Soviet missiles were relatively inaccurate, an ABM system defending silos did not have to fire at every warhead, only those that could be seen falling close to the silos. This meant a small number of interceptors could be effective against a large number of enemy warheads. The Army updated this concept for MX. Under MPS, only one silo would contain a missile, and only the US knew where that missile was. In this case, the interceptor could ignore any warhead not falling on that silo, and by shooting down only one warhead out of 23, they could guarantee that missile would survive. In order to counter this, the Soviets would have to aim two warheads at every silo, assuming one would be lost. Thus a single interceptor was just like doubling the number of silos, although it took up no room. Of course, the Soviets could target the interceptor if they knew where it was. To avoid this, LoADS was packed into a container the size, shape and weight as the MX missile. (LoADS, for Low Altitude Air Defense System, was the name the Sentry system was known by for most of its existence.) This too would be moved about the cell, so the Soviets could not know where it was. There were lingering concerns whether or not the system could actually be built and packaged into an MX-like container. To do so the interceptor itself would have to be quite small, but more importantly, the radar and fire control systems would also have to fit. Origins Swarmjet traces its history ultimately to a series of suggestions made by Richard Garwin as alternatives to large-scale ABM systems like Safeguard. Among these ideas were a \\"bed of nails\\" consisting of vertical steel spikes surrounding the silo that would destroy the warhead before it hit the ground and triggered, jamming systems to interrupt radar fuses, the dust defense where small nuclear warheads would be set off while the warheads approached and throw huge amounts of dust into the air that would abrade the warheads, and a non-nuclear version of the same concept, the \\"curtain of steel pellets\\". The last of these was picked up by Bernard Feld and Kosta Tsipis in a major article in Scientific American in 1979. They proposed replacing the shotgun- like projectiles with swarms of small unguided rockets that would fire at a range of about . As they were unguided, they suggested that they would not be considered interceptor missiles under the ABM treaty, but also suggested that a renegotiation might be required. The Army quickly picked up these options, developing two concepts. The first, Project Quick-Shot, was basically identical to the Feld and Tsipis version, although they did consider some sort of low-cost guidance system as well. A second concept launched optical trackers into space in the path of the incoming missiles, and used their data to fine-tune the launch of unguided rockets that would work at longer ranges. As this had no radar component, it would bypass provisions in the ABM treaty over the number and placement of radar sites. However, whether any of this was seriously considered at the time is debatable; in 1976 the Army placed a contract with McDonnell Douglas to study a low-altitude concept under the name ST-2, but this was the nuclear-armed LoADS concept.  Army interest  Seeking a backup in case LoADS, by this time known as Sentry, failed to meet its size goals, the Army and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) reintroduced the idea of the shotgun-like defence. If LoADS did work, any money spent on a backup would be wasted, so Swarmjet was proposed as an extremely low-cost, low-risk solution. A significant advantage of Swarmjet compared to LoADS was that it was non-nuclear. This meant the system could be kept in a state of high alert at all times, as an accidental firing would not result in a nuclear explosion. A Swarmjet installation consisted of a radar and launcher placed north of the defended site ‚Äì in this case an MX cell. The launcher would contain thousands of spin-stabilized rockets. The radar would determine which warhead was approaching the occupied MX silo and then fire the entire set of rockets in its path in a shotgun-like salvo. The warhead would be destroyed in the hypervelocity impact. While there was widespread agreement that such a collision would indeed destroy a warhead, there was disagreement on how many rockets would be needed to ensure one hit the warhead. This was exacerbated by uncertainties in the environment they would fly through, which would include the dust and debris of the explosions of the warheads they chose not to intercept. Any such uncertainty requires more rockets, to the point where it was considered unlikely the system would be able to fit into an MX container. In this case, the solution would be to use a separate launchers, but that would open them to attack. To mitigate this, a separate launcher would be needed for every silo, an expensive option. Various deployment scenarios using multiple radars and launchers were outlined.  Dense pack  The political problem of building thousands of missiles silos that would be among the first targets hit in a war across two states quickly became politically impossible. Described as an \\"extravaganza\\", politicians in both states were set against the idea, notably powerful Nevada Senator Paul Laxalt. When The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints came out against it, any hope of deploying MPS was over. In 1981, President Reagan came to power partially on a plank of US military inadequacy blamed on the Carter administration. As part of their plans to improve their strategic posture, in an October 1981 Reagan gave a speech on strategic forces. He had close ties with Laxalt, and called MPS \\"a Rube Goldberg scheme\\". Instead, he suggested placing MX in existing Minuteman and Titan II silos to \\"restore a sense of national will\\", before the final decision on a basing solution was made. During a second speech on the topic on 22 November 1982, Reagan announced that the missiles would be deployed in a dense pack. This consisted of a series of super-hardened silos that could withstand more than 10,000 psi (70 MPa) of overpressure, compared to 5,000 psi of the MPS proposal. Such a silo would require a very close miss in order to be destroyed, so close that the explosion of one warhead attacking a silo would kick up so much dust that another arriving to attack a nearby silo would be destroyed by the impact with the dust. This \\"fratricide theory\\" was highly criticized due to the ease with which the Soviets could modify their warheads and circumvent this design. All that was required was that several warheads arrive and be detonated within a few milliseconds of each other, so the blast waves did not reach each other before completing destruction of the silo. Such timing could be easily achieved with commercially available clocks. Congress again rejected the system. As part of the same position statement, Reagan spoke out against an ABM defense of the fields, stating \\"we do not wish to embark on any course of action that could endanger the current ABM treaty so long as it is observed by the Soviet Union\\". Sentry was cancelled in February 1983.  Realignment  In spite of this, Swarmjet was once again raised as a possibility to protect the dense pack deployment. In this case the distance between the silos was so small, about , that a single set of radars could control the entire battle, with one or more Swarmjet launchers placed between the MX silos. If the Soviets sent over many warheads closely spaced, a single Swarmjet salvo could break up the attack. To avoid this attack the warheads would have to arrive further apart in time, but this would lead to the possibility of them destroying each other. A successful attack would have to be property timed, and while such a thing was certainly not difficult to arrange, the attack would be stretched out enough that the US would have time to launch a counterattack. Even in that case, Swarmjet itself would be able to handle multiple interceptions given enough time, further complicating the attack. A major downside to the Swarmjet proposal is that by any reasonable reading of the ABM Treaty it was illegal; the treaty states that \\"Each Party undertakes not to deploy ABM systems for the defense of the territory of its country and not to provide a base for such defense, and not to deploy ABM system for defense of an individual region except as provided for in Article III of this Treaty.\\" Article III, amended in 1974, limited the US to a single defended area, the Minuteman missile fields near Grand Forks, North Dakota. This was far from the desired basing for the MX in Wyoming, so if new silos were constructed they could not be defended without amending the treaty. Reagan justified the deployment by claiming that Swarmjet was not an ABM, but a form of \\"active hardening\\". Another problem with Swarmjet was that it could be argued that it eliminated the need for MX. Its entire purpose was not to break up a Soviet attack entirely, but simply introduce so much uncertainty into an attack that they could not consider it. Swarmjet would do this for any attack, whether on MX in dense pack, in existing Minuteman silos, or the existing Minuteman fleet. So if Swarmjet did work, it argued against spending money on MX as well. It is speculated that this is the major reason why Swarmjet saw so little official interest in the early 1980s.  Scowcroft Commission  The basing mode for MX was put in the hands of a committee led by the National Security Advisor, Brent Scowcroft, called the \\"President's Commission on Strategic Forces\\". Their 1983 report essentially stated that the issue of ICBM vulnerability was an illusion; they concluded the Soviets could not contemplate any attack that left any significant fraction of the US deterrent force in place, notably the SLBM force, and they could find no scenario under which this could possibly occur. Further, they reported that if even a \\"totally effective defense\\" were constructed, there could never be confidence that such a system would not be defeated through subterfuge. Although there is no record of Swarmjet being officially cancelled, calls for its construction were never officially answered and the matter simply disappeared from the historical record.

The farm has been in active use since about 1850, most of them by the Isham family. The farmstead includes a c. 1850 Gothic Revival house and farm buildings of similar vintage. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992, and is the subject of a conservation easement preserving its agricultural character. Description and history The Isham farm consists of of land, divided into two parcels. The larger western parcel is itself divided by Oak Hill Road, with the farmstead on the smaller eastern half. Meeting at the easternmost corner of the larger parcel is a roughly rectangular but otherwise landlocked parcel. The farm property has for many years served as a dairy farm, and its land is divided into cropland, pasture, hay, and woodlots. The farm complex occupies about on the east side of Oak Hill Road. It includes a c. 1850 farmhouse with vernacular Gothic Revival elements, and a carriage barn and dairy barn dating to the same time. Most of the remaining buildings are from the 20th century. with The farm was established about 1850 by Hiram and Charlotte Murray, the house built for them by her father, George Whitney. The couple primarily raised sheep, but had a significant side business producing butter and cheese. In 1871 Jarius David Isham purchased the Murray property, adding it to a small parcel he had previously purchased. Since then, several generations have worked the land principally as a dairy operation. In 2002, David Isham donated a conservation easement to the Vermont Land Trust, providing for the property's preservation as a farm.

He is a writer, actor, director and workshop leader as well as a trainer and consultant. He was editor of DAIL Magazine during the 1990s, has worked as Diversity Officer at Arts Council England, was Associate Director at Graeae Theatre Company, is a Senior Associate at Diverse City and Director of The Big Lounge Collective which he co-founded in 2011. He has achieved the honour of Clore Fellow.  Early/Personal Life  Beddard attended Thomas Delarue School in Tonbridge, Kent, which, established by The National Spastics Society in 1955, was the first grammar school for disabled people. The Headmaster, Richard Tomlinson was a co-founder of Graeae Theatre Company, where Beddard would later work as an actor, writer and director. Beddard was among the first disabled students to graduate from the University of Kent, with a degree in Sociology. Not all of Beddard's family were in creative professions. His grandfathers were both sportsmen; one being a fencer in the London Olympics and the other a Cambridge Blue. Beddard followed the Olympic tradition by directing 'Breathe/Battle of the Winds' for the Opening Ceremony (Sailing) of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games on Weymouth Beach. Beddard lives in North London with his partner Jo and children Llewelyn and Willow.  Career  Beddard is an established artist who entered into the Disability arts world with no traditional performance training. In his own words, his career began \\"through a bizarre set of circumstances [when I] was jettisoned onto a film set, and a journey through the hinterlands of performance began.\\" According to Jonathan Meth in the Guardian, seeing Beddard on a poster for Graeae Theatre Company's production of Ubu inspired Daryl Beeton, former Artistic Director of Kazzum Theatre to enter the profession.  Writing  Plays = Beddard has written plays for Graeae Theatre Company, Soho Theatre, Paines Plough and Writenet. These are referenced in Gary Owen's 'The Drowned World' and include: * Walking Among Sleepers (Jo Rawlinson & Caroline Parker) * A Fading Light (Paines Plough, Graeae Theatre Company) * Life Support (Writenet/Soho Theatre) = Articles = Beddard has written a number of articles around Disability Arts and Performance: * The importance of being disabled, 2009 (Guardian) * Jamie Beddard is Unwell... in India, 2004 (BBC Ouch) * The disability meal ticket, 2003 (BBC Ouch)  Directing  Beddard has held various Company positions and directed a range of cross-media productions. He was Associate Director at Graeae Theatre Company (2005‚Äì2007) and at Diverse City (2008‚Äì2010). He was Guest Director for the Disabled Actors Theatre Company in 2011, and returned to Diverse City as Guest Director in 2012. He is Director of The Big Lounge Collective (2011 ‚Äì present). His productions include Fluff, Jackson's Lane (2004), The Last Freakshow, Fittings Multi-Media Arts (2005), The Trouble with Richard, Graeae Theatre Company (2005), The Drowned World, Edinburgh Traverse (2005), The Bigger Picture, Greenwich Theatre (2006), Pinocchio, Theatre Royal Stratford (2006), Reclaiming the Medical Model, Diverse City/Metropolitan University (2007), The Last Freakshow, Disabled Actors Theatre Company (2008), Didn't We Have a Lovely Time, Diverse City (2009), Can I Be Frank With You, Disabled Actors Theatre Company (2011) and Breathe (Battle of the Winds), Diverse City (2012).  Acting  Beddard has an extensive Acting career which include roles in Theatre, TV and Film. = Stage Work = Beddard's most recent appearance was in The Threepenny Opera (National Theatre) in 2016 which was heralded as \\"a brilliant move\\" in a review by The Telegraph, which awarded the show three stars. Variety's review was equally mixed, though it praised Beddard's contribution: \\"Jamie Beddard, an actor with cerebral palsy, scor[es] with every punchline.\\" His performance was also picked up on in the Financial Times: \\"Jamie Beddard plays the most astute of Macheath's lieutenants, largely from a wheelchair due to cerebral palsy, but makes every expletive ring through the Olivier.\\" Beddard's appearance in the production was mentioned by Vikki Heyward in The Stage as indicative of \\"a new era of theatre, an era of acceptance and realisation that Deaf and disabled people should be ‚Äì and can be ‚Äì involved in a variety of shows\\" Mark Shenton in his review of the show, also in The Stage remarked: \\"It is also notable, because it‚Äôs so rare, to see a wheelchair-using actor, Jamie Beddard, among the ensemble.\\" This came at a time when the National Theatre were starting to change its auditioning policy by responding to The Creative Case and opening its doors to disabled actors. As Disability Arts Online's Editor, Colin Hambrook observed in a review of the show: \\"aside from Nabil Shaban, Beddard is the only other wheelchair-using actor to tread the boards of the National Theatre in a pivotal role.\\" Rufus Norris, Artistic Director at National Theatre who directed the production, has since reiterated his desire to work with Beddard again, telling The Stage: \\"Next time [I want to work with a disabled actor] I will think of Jamie, I won't think 'I need to find some disabled performers'\\". Prior to becoming Associate Director at Graeae Theatre Company, Beddard had a number of acting roles with the company. These include the title role in Ubu (1994), and Christian in Fittings (2000). Beddard's portrayal of Corbaccio in Flesh Fly (1997) garnered commentary in literary criticism volumes about Ben Jonson's play. Marshall Botvinick described Graeae's production as 'possibly the most innovative staging [of the play] to date' and remarked: 'Jamie Beddard, an actor with cerebral palsy played the part of Corbaccio, making it much harder for an audience to laugh at Corbaccio's many ailments'. Beddard's portrayal was also singled out in Ben Jonson and Theatre: Performance, Practice and Theory for the way it confronted the prejudices of non-disabled audience members: 'it was less easy for the able-bodied members of the audience to laugh...though the disabled members of the audience found [Beddard's] performance uproarious, as if they had earned the right to laugh. Here that factionalising of the audience which Jonson frequently promotes came forcefully alive to one's awareness, causing one to question the grounds on which one might laugh.' Beddard played the role of Mathieu in Traverse Theatre's 2007 production, 15 Seconds which was awarded three stars by the Guardian, with Mark Fisher highlighting Beddard's performance: \\"[Mathieu] is played by Jamie Beddard with a great forlorn frown, dreamy eyes and a deadpan black humour that cleverly undercuts our expectations of the character and the actor's disability.\\" His other theatre roles are * Estragon in Waiting for Godot, Tottering Bipeds (1998) * The Dormouse in Alice in Wonderland, Nottingham Playhouse (1998) * Voldov in The Bound Man, Battersea Arts Centre (1999) * Francious in The Fly, Manchester Royal Exchange (2003) * Quassimodo in The Kings of Fools, DASH (2006) * Roger in Natural Diversions, Natural Theatre Company (2013) Beddard has performed in Carrie's War twice, both times playing Mr Johnny at Apollo, Shaftsbury Avenue (2009), and for Novel Theatre (2011). The former was awarded four stars by The Telegraph with Beddard described as providing \\"fine support\\". = TV and film = In the 1990s, Beddard played the lead Arthur in the BBC2 Screenplay Skalligrigg (1994) and Mike Bradley in ID for BBC Films (1995). He starred as Terry in Poland Productions' Trouble with Terry (1998) and played Gavin in BBC TV's production of Common as Muck (1999). In the same year Beddard played Rolandn Adams on the BBC made-for-TV film All the King's Men. In the 2000s, he played the leading role of Man, in Channel 4's production of Access All Areas (2000), going on to play Nobby in Hartwood Films' Wonderful You (2001) and a few years later played Gobber in Quills for Carlton Films (2005). He played Johnny for BBC Wales' production of Carrie's War (2004), with The Movie Scene praising the \\"great casting\\". In 2002, Beddard played the leading role of Driver, this time for BBC1's The Egg. He played Elvis for Beaconsfield Films' The Outcasts and Jamie for Turtle Canyon's Wheels, both in 2012. Beddard starred alongside Jason Williamson from the Sleaford Mods in the 2017 short film, Lost Dog, which The Irish News described as \\"a tiny yet thought-provoking slice of life in 'austerity Britain'\\".  Disability rights work  Beddard has been an outspoken advocate of rights for disability rights and for more disabled people to have roles within the creative industries. Beddard has commented \\"I aint broke, you don't need to fix me.\\" This came as part of his focus group response for the 'Re-framing Disability' Exhibition in 2011 which looked at judgements and portrayal of historical representations of disabled people with comparisons to today. In an interview in 2016 with Disability Arts Online Beddard remarked: > \\"I‚Äôd like to see theatre become more inclusive. I love football and having > relaxed performances makes theatre more like football. You should be able to > go to theatre and engage with it. It is a scary time to be a disabled > person, and so many of my contemporaries are desperately struggling, both, > to work and survive. I feel a responsibility to the majority of disabled > people who are finding life increasingly difficult, as Access to Work, the > Independent Living Fund and care packages are savaged, and any gains we have > made over last thirty years are consigned to history.\\" Beddard has also been critical of non-disabled actors playing disabled roles, writing in 2009 article for the Guardian: > \\"Unfortunately, some industry people still struggle with the idea that > disabled actors may be best-placed to play disabled characters, and continue > to represent disability through clouded prisms of metaphor and caricature. > Non-disabled actors boost their red carpet prospects by offensively > replicating impairments, as if physical appearance alone is shorthand for > capturing the essence and character of a disabled protagonist.

It protects an area of Atlantic Forest in a region that has lost most of its forest coverage over the last century, and protects the endemic endangered black lion tamarin Location The Morro do Diabo State Park is in the municipality of Teodoro Sampaio in the Pontal do Paranapanema region, from the state capital of S√£o Paulo. It has an area of . The park has tropical seasonal semi-deciduous vegetation. The park lets visitors have direct contact with nature in a sustainable manner, and supports environmental education and scientific research. The park would be part of the proposed Trinational Biodiversity Corridor, which aims to provide forest connections between conservation units in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina in the Upper Paran√° ecoregion. Environment The park preserves one of the last large areas of the country's upland forest, with the original regional ecosystems. The climate is type CWA. Rainfall is mostly in the summer, averaging . Average daily temperatures range from from May to August to from January to March, with an annual mean temperature of . The park preserves an area of Atlantic Forest in good condition. It has a large reserve of Aspidosperma polyneuron () trees, important for reforestation and recovery of degraded areas. It is home to endangered species such as tapir, peccary, howler monkey, puma and jaguar, and one of the most threatened of all primates, the black lion tamarin, with an estimated 1,200 members of this species. History European occupation of the Pontal do Paranapanema region began in earnest when the Sorocabana Railway reached the Paran√° River in 1917. Urban centers were built along the railway and intensive logging began, followed by farming of coffee, cotton, peanuts and cattle. The state government created the Morro do Diabo Forest Reserve in 1941, now the Morro do Diabo State Park. In 1942 the Great Pontal Reserve and the S√£o Paulo Lagoon Reserve were created. Over the years that followed these two reserves were invaded by squatters and deforested, often with government support. The forest reserve became a state park in 1986. Fishing regulations were published on 2 October 2008, covering conservation areas and their buffer zones in the Paran√° River basin. They were the Morro do Diabo State Park, Rio do Peixe State Park, Rio Aguape√≠ State Park, Mico-Le√£o-Preto Ecological Station, Ivinhema State Park, Ilha Grande National Park, Caiu√° Ecological Station and Igua√ßu National Park.

Over the course of almost two decades, Judge McDover has aided the local Coast Mafia in their scheme to build a casino in partnership with the Tappacola Indian Nation. Aside from skimming money from the casino, the Coast Mafia has also been responsible for many nearby real estate developments, with any legal problems smoothed over by McDover in exchange for cash payments and condominiums. In addition, the Coast Mafia has staged the murder of Son Razko, a prominent anti-casino member of the Tappacola Nation, and McDover has falsely convicted Razko's right-hand man, Junior Mace, of the crime. Mix has been given this information by an intermediary representing an unknown \\"mole\\" close to McDover.

Schmitt, leading author of the Tallinn Manual, for deciding if a state's involvement in a cyber-attack constitutes a use of force. Such a framework is important as part of international law's adaptation process to the growing threat of cyber- warfare. The characteristics of a cyber-attack can determine which legal regime will govern state behavior, and the Schmitt analysis is one of the most commonly used ways of analyzing those characteristics. It can also be used as a basis for training professionals in the legal field to deal with cyberwarfare.  Motivations  As society becomes more dependent on computers for critical infrastructure, countries have become increasingly concerned with threats in cyberspace. The prevalence of computers and the pace of technological innovation has advanced civilization significantly but has left many vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Countries must be prepared to defend themselves and know how to respond accordingly to computer network attacks (CNAs). These unique attacks are different in many ways to the physical uses of force that happen in traditional warfare. Attackers can now remotely disable their targets simply through the transmission of data. CNAs also have a broad definition, and not every CNA enacted by one State upon another is sufficient reason for States to escalate into armed engagement. Depending on if the CNA is treated as a use of force or not, the offending party would be judged based on either IHL or IHRL. And the jus ad bellum is the body of law that defines when it is reasonable for sovereign states to resort to use of force to defend their resources, people and interests. Article 51 of the UN Charter defines a situation where a sovereign state might employ use of force, and it states that: \\"Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self- defense shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\\" A State has the autonomy to act in self-defense, but it needs proof that there is an imminent threat. It also needs to act according to the criteria of proportionality and necessity. The Schmitt analysis is a framework for evaluating a CNA, according to seven parameters, to determine if it constitutes a wrongful use of force, and for governments to decide on a valid course of action after being attacked.  Historical background  The Estonian Cyber-attacks of 2007, targeting Estonia's Internet resources, appear to be the first cyber attacks to be used as a weapon in a political conflict. In Estonia there was tension between the citizens that wanted their country to be more independent and the Russian-Estonians. Because the attacks came from Russian addresses, the Russian government was accused of endorsing the attacks. The UN Security Council did not react to the Estonian cyber-attacks. Afterwards, the threat of cyber-war between States seemed much more real and imminent. This event also highlighted the importance of international cooperation for the protection of cyberspace. It also brings to light the necessity for international legislation regarding what qualifies as appropriate government response to CNAs. During the 2008 conflict between Georgian nationalists and South Ossetian separatists, many Georgian websites were subject to defacement and DDoS attacks. During this conflict a website named StopGeorgia.ru was put up and in it were links to potential targets for attacks, along with malicious software. Russian civilians could participate in the cyber-attacks, and there is the question of if this direct participation implies that they should not be considered civilians anymore. In 2010 the Stuxnet worm that infected Natanz uranium enrichment facilities in Iran and is suspected to have destroyed up to a 1000 centrifuges was discovered, setting back Iran's nuclear program by several years. The Russian company Kaspersky said the virus could only have been deployed with nation-state support, and that it would lead to the creation of a new kind of arms race in the world. Considering the damage caused, along with the invasiveness, lack of clear legitimacy and the speculation that the worm was developed and deployed with help of U.S. government with possible Israeli or German assistance means Stuxnet could seen as a use of force. Though it might not be seen as an unlawful use of force since the Iran nuclear activities targeted were illegal. For this reason the virus has been called a cyber-weapon, although the Iranian government did not claim it had been victim of a cyber-attack. The Iranian government's inaction might have implications for the development of legal norms regarding cyberspace, and a state's inaction is not addressed by the Schmitt framework.  CNA as a use of force  Schmitt's analysis is strongly tied to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, which states that: \\"All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.\\" Not every use of force falls within the scope of Article 2(4), only those that may threaten international peace. And the article does not specify armed force, and there is the question of if it can be read as any kind of force, even economic force such as through violative economic coercion. The idea is that any use of force not authorized within the Charter is wrongful. In practice though, it is necessary to have a degree of flexibility. There are situations, such as those of decolonization and humanitarian intervention, that a strict following of this rule might not aligned with community interests. And the law regarding use of force needs to adapt and evolve to new situations and circumstances, such as those of cyber-warfare. It would be difficult to classify every CNA as a use of force, considering for example that some might not even cause any direct physical damage. To make use of the established law that has dealt with armed forces, Schmitt proposed comparing the characteristics and consequences of CNAs. This goal of this case-by-case approach is to properly classify with CNAs fall into the category of use of force and which do not.  The nuclear warfare analogy  Computer network attacks are, like weapons of mass destructions, asymmetric in nature. Since infrastructure such as power grids, transportation, and telecommunications are interlinked, an attack on one site might have a catastrophic domino effect. The destructive capabilities of cyber-attacks have been compared to the effects of nuclear radiation and the EMP effect of nuclear blasts. Small countries wanting to have an impact can take advantage of how cheap it is to launch a CNA. Nuclear weapons have also not been outlawed, but along other weapons of warfare, there is a need to be very careful about using or threatening to use these weapons and follow rules of proportionality, necessity, and humanity. Both nuclear weapons and information weapons do not distinguish between civilians and non-civilians.  Analysis criteria  Seven criteria are used to evaluate the computer network attack. The analysis focuses predominantly on criteria that are dependent on the consequences of the CNA (and as such a cyber attack is considered a cyber attack only when there is injury, death and to objects and their functionality), and so it is more useful for analyzing events after they have happened and not as they are being planned. This utilitarian focus is also predominant in the jus in bello, which strives for humanity while still allowing for in some cases a trade-off between military gains and civilian casualties, for example. The Schmitt analysis is also subjective, and depends heavily on context. It does not try to set measurements for where the boundaries where CNAs become uses of force, but instead tries to compare the characteristics of a particular CNA and characteristics of traditional uses of force. # Severity: This is the level of destruction caused by the attack. The scope, duration and intensity of the attack are taken into consideration. Defacing a public figure's website might be considered not a use of force, while disabling an online banking system or shutting off a nuclear plant's safety mechanisms might be. # Immediacy: The speed of which the harm is done, where a more immediate attack leaves less room for dialogue and negotiation between the attacker and the target. For a State to act in self-defense, it should have irrefutable proof that the threat to the nation is immediate. # Directness: A CNA might have unexpected consequences, and it can be difficult to predict the complete impact of a cyber-attack. This is how clear it is that the consequences are in fact consequences of the CNA and not of other events. # Invasiveness: CNAs are normally less invasive than a movement of troops into a State's territory. If a cyber-attack affects the sovereignty of a state, then it is more likely to be considered a use of force. # Measurability: This is how clear the exact consequences of the CNA are in terms of how much damage has been done. In armed coercion, the consequences tend to be very clear. # Presumptive legitimacy: A State might employ a CNA as a method of defensive counter- attack. Self-defense is one of the exceptions to the prohibition of the application of violence. A state might also employ CNAs in a way that does not resemble armed coercion. # Responsibility: The USDOD argues that if an attack from State A to State B is not sponsored by State A, then State B does not have the right to invade State A's nation, and should instead ask for it to intervene and stop the attack. But since attackers can route their data through remote locations, it may be difficult to attribute with certainty a CNA to the accused State, such as happened in Estonia in 2007. A relevant factor when performing a Schmitt Analysis is to ask if the perpetrators of the attack attempted to act in accordance to the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC). This might be the case of Stuxnet, which was designed to minimize collateral damage, and only spread beyond its intended target accidentally. This attempted can imply state involvement in the attack, since private individuals might not be so concerned with international law. And it also means that the attack is more likely to be characterized as a use of force, even if they do not cause actual damage.  Potential shortcomings  The main issue with using the Schmitt framework is that it requires attribution, the attacking nation must be held responsible for the attack. This does not seem to happen in most cases, as states carry their actions within cyberspace in a secretive fashion and do not claim responsibility. There is also the possibility that the state that has been attacked will not take action against the offenders, and will not accuse another state of unlawful action. Some also criticize the framework's adherence to Article 2(4)'s instrument-based paradigm and restrictive definition of unlawful use of force, and favor a more consequence- based framework.

On top of their two flagship titles - Life is Feudal: Your Own and Life is Feudal: MMO, Bitbox Ltd have expanded the franchise by publishing other titles, such as MindIllusion's title, Forest Village.  Development  During the late winter of 2014, the indie team - which later became Bitbox Ltd - had created a working tech demo for the concept of Life is Feudal: MMO, showcasing many of the main gameplay features, such as real time multiplayer, terraforming, and objects construction. After finding an investor, development continued for two years, with a team of originally five that grew to fifteen during this period of time. Both Life is Feudal: Your Own (LiF:YO) and Life is Feudal: MMO (LiF:MMO) shared many of the core mechanics and gameplay, leading to a largely shared codebase for both games being developed simultaneously. Life is Feudal: Your Own was first launched by Bitbox Ltd. on the gaming platform Steam in September 2014 under the Early Access program, reaching Steam's ‚ÄòTop Ten‚Äô within two weeks.\\"Life is Feudal Press Release\\"(2 October 2014). Gamasutra. Retrieved 7 November 2016 Within a month, Life is Feudal: Your Own sold over 100,000 copies and continued to rise in popularity. Life is Feudal: Your Own was released out of Early Access on 17 November 2015, including a trailer and launch cutscene narrated by Sean Bean\\"Sean Bean escorts Life is Feudal out of Early Access\\"(Andy Chalk, 6 November 2015).

Retrieved 10 November 2016 along with many new mechanics, balancing tweaks and bug fixes. The game is, as of November 2016, still being actively supported by the development team, with numerous patches introducing further features and improvements on the existing game. After the release of Life is Feudal: Your Own, Bitbox Ltd. began the transition into a larger team focusing on Life is Feudal: MMO. Closed beta tests for the game began during the second half of 2016.\\"Life is Feudal MMO\\"wccftech.com. Retrieved 15 November 2016 Bitbox Ltd. also announced a partnership with Xsolla in support of Life is Feudal: MMO. In 2016, Bitbox Ltd. also published another game as part of the Life is Feudal franchise; Life is Feudal: Forest Village, currently being developed by the studio MindIllusion and available on Steam Early Access. Life is Feudal: Forest Village is an alternative take on a similar scenario to the one facing players in previous titles - in this game, the player assumes control of a settlement of villagers, leading them through a survival simulation, with aspects such as seasonal changes, vegetation and illness presenting problems that threaten the village's stability.  Life is Feudal: Your Own  In Life is Feudal: Your Own, the player is given an open ended starting point on a 9 square kilometers map, from which they must gather necessary resources to survive. Mechanics such as hunger, wild animals and player vs. player combat are the most immediate threats to players, encouraging co-operation with other nearby players in order to gain an advantage. Players can also build structures, weapons and armour, as well as breeding a variety of animals. Life is Feudal: Your Own allows up to 64 players to join a private or public hosted server, with a variety of configurable options, many of which can be fine-tuned in the game's hosting interface. An executable to run a dedicated server is also offered. Recent updates to LIF:YO have made the gameplay an almost mirror copy of the MMO, where it once operated like two completely different entities. This has given the opportunity for players to switch back and forth between the two platforms without having to relearn the mechanics entirely. However, some strife has arisen due to the implementation of \\"regional\\" resource requirements for end game buildings, armor, etc. For LIF:YO players, it is now imperative to work as a team or trade with others in order to utilize the full skill and tech tree options.  Life is Feudal: MMO  Life is Feudal: MMO is a multiplayer sandbox RPG with survival aspects. Described as a \\"real life Medieval simulator MMO\\", the game features a 21km x 21km world inspired by the cold regions of Northern Europe. Life is Feudal: MMO takes place in a realistic feudal setting where players work their way up from scavenging for materials and shelter to becoming a leader of a guild. The game features a crafting system, building features, and terraforming across the map - meaning players can build their own house and town anywhere in the world. Note: Both LIF:YO and LIF:MMO are still being worked on by the development team. However, bug patches and content updates have slowed. More effort has been put into various \\"skins\\" for weapons, clothing, etc. as well as limited skill \\"bonuses\\". This has caused a great divide in the player base as well as the complete overhaul of several key gameplay components. It remains to be seen where the development team will take this game in the near future.

The main challenge at the time, was to assert the independence of the judiciary and promote the development of the system of administration of justice, attached to ethics and law. It was essential the creation of a top training center for judges, since the Supreme Court, as soon as they took office, appointed new judges in courts throughout the country, who needed to be trained according to best practices court. That was how the February 12, 1998, by resolution of the Plenum of the Supreme Court, was born the School of Magistrates. Later on August 11, 1998, it was enacted Judicial Career Law, which was formally constituted as the National Judicial College, a body under the Dominican Judiciary and with the mission to train civil servants of the judiciary institution . With no background in the country of training for the training of judges, they proceeded to explore the best practices of Latin American law schools, and establish links with entities and consultants that could help direct the first steps of the school. structure and management, whose servers were selected by public tender was then formed. It was thus, as in 1998 he was selected the first Board, composed of judges Jorge A. Subero Isa, Victor Jose Castellanos, Arelis Ricourt An√≠bal G√≥mez and Claudio Medrano. Likewise, doctors Juan Manuel Pellerano and Babado Diego Torres, the lawyer director Luis Henry Molina; international consultants, national teachers and, later, to aspiring judges. Fulfilling the purpose for which it was created, the National Judicial College expanded its mission, focusing on contributing to excellence in the system of administration of justice, and it implemented a set of programs designed to meet all training needs of the members of the Judiciary and those who aspired to be part of it. This included cooperation with training and renewal of other players in the justice sector, while it has intent to enrich the national legal acquis and the relationships between the various actors in national legal community internationally. The scope of work and for 2002, by resolution of the Plenum of the Supreme Court, the School receives the task of training all those who aspire to be part of the Public Defender (the latter was born the same year under the wings of the Supreme Court). This assignment was confirmed by the Law 277-04 created the National Public Defense Service. Since 2001, the School has formed 13 of aspiring Magistrate, nine groups of aspiring Public Defender, four for Social Worker programs and five for Judicial Research.  Sharing knowledge  At the international level the National Judicial College has developed a significant presence in the field of judicial training. It was the General Secretariat of the Latin American Network of Judicial Schools (RIAEJ) for ten years (2001-2011), currently composed of more than 60 judicial training centers throughout Latin America, among which there are 2 subnets (Schools Network judicial of the Argentine provinces and the Network of judicial Schools States of Mexico). The RIAEJ is a community liaison for cooperation and mutual support between judicial schools and public centers of judicial training Iberoam√©rica.

His recording career lasted well over a decade. Two of his standout songs are \\"Crying Mother Blues\\" and \\"Streamline Train\\" (both 1936). His accompanists on record variously included Cripple Clarence Lofton, Blind John Davis, Black Bob, Kansas Joe McCoy, Papa Charlie McCoy, Big Bill Broonzy and Lonnie Johnson. His 1947 release \\"Mother Fuyer\\" managed to escaped censorship. Life and career Nelson Wilborn was born in Sumner, Tallahatchie County, Mississippi. He relocated to Chicago, Illinois, in the early 1930s, where he regularly performed in their nightclubs. Nelson's recording career began in 1935 and lasted until 1947. He was noted as \\"a fine vocalist with a telling falsetto\\", and was fortunate to be accompanied in his recordings with some of the best musicians available at that time. These included the pianist Cripple Clarence Lofton, with whom Nelson recorded several sides for Decca Records during 1935 and 1936. \\"Crying Mother Blues\\" and \\"Streamline Train\\" (both 1936) are two of the tracks from the period that music journalists have described as the best of his career. The two tracks were also issued on the same shellac disc by Brunswick Records in its Sepia Series. Others who accompanied Nelson on record were the pianists Charles Avery, Blind John Davis and Black Bob and the guitarists Kansas Joe McCoy, Papa Charlie McCoy and Big Bill Broonzy. His vocals were often held back from emotional extremes, to serve the fashion of the time. Nelson later recorded with James Clark playing piano, particularly on his recordings in 1947, issued by Aladdin Records. His guitar accompaniment at that time was provided by Lonnie Johnson. \\"Mother Fuyer\\", a jump blues song in the dirty blues tradition (including the lyric \\"I got to put this mule to jumpin' in yo' stall, I'm a lovin' muther for ya\\") written and recorded by Nelson in 1947 under the nom de disque Dirty Red, was released by Aladdin Records as a 78-rpm 10\\" shellac disc.

His whereabouts thereafter are shrouded in mystery, and, rather oddly, there appears to be no surviving photograph of him. He was known to like double entendres, which may have explained his brief excursion from normality. Nelson died in March 1970, aged 62, in Chicago .

He was born in 1944 in Foglianise, a region located in the mountains of Sannio, Italy.* He grew up and lived in Naples until 1976. After this point, he moved to Florence.* He graduated in Medieval Aesthetics, with a thesis on carmina figurata. While in Naples he was also the editor of many magazines of the avant-garde, among them Linea Sud, Ana etcetera, Continuum, Uomini e Idee, Silence's Wake, E/mana/zione etc....* Influences As a young student of philosophy, Luciano Caruso was influenced by the style of Benedetto Croce and Antonio Gramsci.* In Naples, he was surrounded by the work of the historians Nino Cortese, Vincenzo Cilento, Giuseppe Galasso, Francesco Compagna, Salvatore Battaglia, and the Latin scholar Francesco Arnaldi. He frequented ‚Äòheretics‚Äô such the art historian Raffaello Causa and the writer Luigi Incoronato. He held a political loyalty which brought him into extremely close contact with the conditions of life in the poorer parts of Naples. This loyalty brought to his attention the problematic nature parallel with art and contemporary poetry. He spent a lot of time in Naples with the painters of Group 58. These artists included Enrico Bugli, Bruno Di Bello, Lucio Del Pezzo, Mario Persico, Salvatore Paladino, Guido Biasi etc.... Among such artists Luciano Caruso was closest to Mario Colucci, who, having himself joined the movement ‚ÄòPittura Nucleare‚Äô, brought Caruso into contact with the Milanese environment as well as the Parisian. He did this by introducing him to Baj, D‚ÄôAngelo and Manzoni as well as the Parisian Letterism, Dufr√®ne and the Situationists. Caruso was also influenced by the French experience of the 60s. This is evident in his use of the analogue procedure of Surrealist descent and also in his experimentation with the possibility of the ‚Äòletter‚Äô freed from the word in artist expression. He met up regularly with the poet Stelio Maria Martini, together founding the group Continuum in 1967.* Caruso would also often visit Rome to see Emilio Villa and Mario Diacono. Caruso re- discovered medieval visual tests and researched painters such as Alberto Burri. This research resulted in the artistic use of manual or printed writing. Caruso also began creating works using untouched or torn paper, paper respected or tampered, paper with stains or deletions. He started assembling works with everyday or strange recycled objects. For example, Caruso would use bark, rope, sheets of paper. His first calligraphic works can be traced back to 1963‚Äì64 and his first book was created in 1965. After the anthology Il gesto poetico of avant-garde poetry (Naples, 1968) Caruso produced a substantial amount of essays, writings, revisions and annotations. Luciano Caruso was both a practitioner and student of Futurism, looking over the re- printing of various Futurist texts starting from 1974. Between 1976 and 1994 he collaborated with the British composer and early Fluxus artist Dick Higgins. Demise Luciano Caruso himself held around 60 personal exhibitions and participated in a number of exhibitions dedicated to ‚ÄòPoesia Visuale‚Äô, ‚ÄòPoesia visiva‚Äô, ‚ÄòNuova scrittura‚Äô and ‚ÄòLibri d‚Äôartista‚Äô, in Italy and abroad.* Many of his later artistic works, such as ‚ÄòThe silk road‚Äô and ‚ÄòAtlanta‚Äô are dedicated to the theme of \\"artistic life as a long journey\\". Caruso was among the curators of the exhibition ‚ÄòAlfabeto in sogno‚Äô in 2002 in Reggio Emilia and, in November, he presented his final pieces in Naples: 5 books. On 16 December 2002, Luciano Caruso died in Florence.* ReferencesSources      Category:2002 deaths Category:1944 births Category:20th-century Italian poets Category:Futurist artists Category:Italian male poets Category:20th-century Italian male writers ","title":"Luciano Caruso (poet)"},{"id":"52214881","title":"Chad Wheeler"},{"id":"52214882","text":"The Islamization of Albania occurred as a result of the Ottoman conquest of Albania during the late 14th century. The Ottomans through their administration and military brought Islam to Albania through various policies and tax incentives, trade networks and transnational religious links. In the first few centuries of Ottoman rule, the spread of Islam in Albania was slow and mainly intensified during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries due in part to greater Ottoman societal and military integration, geo-political factors and collapse of church structures. It was one of the most significant developments in Albanian history as Albanians in Albania went from being a largely Christian (Catholic and Orthodox) population to one that is mainly Muslim (Sunni, Bektashi and some other sects), while retaining significant ethnic Albanian Christian minorities in certain regions. The resulting situation where Sunni Islam was the largest faith in the Albanian ethnolinguistic area but other faiths were also present in a regional patchwork played a major influence in shaping the political development of Albania in the late Ottoman period. Apart from religious changes, conversion to Islam also brought about other social and cultural transformations that have shaped and influenced Albanians and Albanian culture. During the 16th and 18th century, Christian Albanians were also forcibly converted to Islam through harsh violence, harassment and increased taxes from the Ottomans. This treatment sparked the Albanian revolts of 1433-1439, 1452, 1480-81, 1506-07, 1519-20, 1594, 1601-02, 1621, 1614, 1618, 1683-84, 1737, 1833-39, 1844 and 1850. Although Albanians maintained a Crypto-Christian culture, known as \\"Laramans\\", those who tried to revert to Christianity, encouraged by Pope Clement XI, faced death penalty according to Ottoman law. Eventually, Albanians surpassed other Balkan groups in the Ottoman ruling class and influence thus gaining a predominant position, despite being few in numbers.  History = Early Ottoman period  Skanderbeg (1405 ‚Äì1468) Albanians began converting to Islam when they became part of the Ottoman Empire in the late 14th century. Albania differs from other regions in the Balkans such as Bulgaria and Bosnia in that until the 1500s, Islam remained confined to members of the co-opted aristocracy and sparse military outpost settlements of Yuruks.Zhelyazkova, Antonina. ‚Äò‚ÄôAlbanian Identities‚Äô‚Äô. Sofia, 2000: International Center for Minority Studies and Intercultural Relations. Page 15-16 Thus, actual conversion to Islam at first occurred mainly amongst the Christian elite, who retained some previous political and economic privileges, and the emerging class of timar or estate holders of the sipahis in the new Ottoman system.. These included aristocratic figures such as George Kastrioti (Skanderbeg) who while in the service of the Ottomans was a convert to Islam and later reverted to Christianity during the late 15th century northern Albanian uprising he initiated. In doing so, he also ordered others who had embraced Islam or were Muslim colonists to convert to Christianity or face death.. \\"The Ottomans first invaded Albania in 1385. A second Ottoman force was sent to Albania 1394-96, occupying the country. Given both the Ottoman disposition to tolerate religious diversity among loyal subjects and the generally bellicose traditions of the Albanians, Ottoman authorities adopted a conciliatory policy toward Albanian Christians in the early decades of occupation. Still, although conversion to Islam was not required, a Christian Albanian lord could count on winning favor if he converted. If the Ottomans did not believe that religious reasons could compel a Christian to convert to Islam, they nonetheless looked askance when a Muslim converted (or reconverted) to Christianity. This happened in 1443 when Gjergj Kastrioti (called Skenderbeg), who had been reared as a Muslim in the sultan's palace, abandoned the Islamic faith and publicly reverted to the creed of his forefathers. But this conversion was not merely a public gesture of defiance. It was the first act in a revolutionary drama. For, after changing his religious allegiance, Skenderbeg demanded that Muslim colonists and converts alike embrace Christianity on pain of death, declaring a kind of holy war against the sultan/caliph.\\" Skanderbeg received military assistance from the Kingdom of Naples that sent in 1452 Ramon d‚ÄôOrtaf√† who was appointed as viceroy of Albania and tasked with maintaining Catholicism among the local population from the spread of Islam.. During the conflicts between Skanderbeg and Ottomans the various battles and raiding pushed Sultan Mehmet II to construct the fortress of Elbasan (1466) in the lowlands to counter resistance coming from the mountain strongholds.. Prior to and after Skanderbeg's death (1468) parts of the Albanian aristocracy migrated to southern Italy with some number of Albanians to escape the Ottoman conquest whose descendants still reside in many villages they settled. Siege of Shkod√´r, 1478 Even long after the fall of Skanderbeg, large regions of the Albanian countryside frequently rebelled against Ottoman rule, often incurring large human costs, including the decimation of whole villages.Zhelyazkova, Antonina, ‚Äò‚ÄôAlbanian identities‚Äô‚Äô, page 15. In the 1570s, a concerted effort by Ottoman rulers to convert the native population to Islam in order to stop the occurrence of seasonal rebellions began in Elbasan and Reka, and a failed rebellion in 1596 among Catholics in the North preceded a series of heavy punitive measures that induced conversion to Islam.Zhelyazkova, Antonina. ‚Äò‚ÄôAlbanian Identities‚Äô‚Äô. Pages 15-16, 19. The peak of Islamization in Albania occurred much later than other Islamized or partially Islamized areas: 16th century Ottoman census data showed that sanjaks where Albanians lived remained overwhelmingly Christian with Muslims making up no more than 5% in most areas while during this period Muslims had already risen to large proportions in parts of Bosnia (Bosnia 46%, Herzegovina 43%, urban Sarajevo 100%), Northern Greece (Trikala 17.5%), urban Macedonia (Skopje and Bitola both at 75%) and Eastern Bulgaria (Silistra 72%, Chirmen 88%, Nikopol 22%). Later on, in the 19th century, when the process of Islamization had halted in most of the Balkans it continued to make significant progress in Albania, especially in the South. In the early period of Ottoman rule the areas that form contemporary Albania were reorganised into an administrative unit named Sancak-i Arnavid or Sancak-i Arnavud.. During the onset of Ottoman rule only prominent churches with significant symbolic meaning or cultural value of an urban settlement were converted into mosques.. Most early mosques constructed in Albania were mainly built within fortresses for Ottoman garrisons at times by Ottoman Sultans during their military campaigns in the area like Fatih Sultan Mehmet Mosque in Shkod√´r, the Red Mosque in Berat and others. As a rule, Ottoman rule largely tolerated Christian subjects but also discriminated against them, making them second- class citizens with higher taxes and various legal restrictions like being unable to take Muslims to court, have horses, have weapons, or have houses overlooking those of Muslims. While the Ottoman authorities were chronically suspicious of Catholicism, they largely allowed the Orthodox church to function unhindered, except during certain periods when the church was suppressed with expulsions of bishops and seizure of property and revenues. During the Ottoman period, most Christians as well as most Muslims employed a degree of syncretism, still practicing various pagan rites; many of these rites are best preserved among mystical orders like the Bektashi Order.Vryonis, Spyros.

Northern Albania  Pope Clement XI was the Pope from 1700 to 1721. Born to the noble Albani family of Italian and Albanian origin,http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2014/09/21/fr_lombardi_papal_journey_a_blessing_for_all_albanians/1107019, ...\\"a silver portrait of Pope Clement XI ‚Äì who belonged to the Albani family, so was traditionally of Albanian origin.\\" and convened the Kuvendi i Arb√´nit to halt the decline of the Catholic population The Ottoman conquest of certain northern cities from the Venetians happened separately to the initial conquest of Albania from local feudal lords. Cities such as Lezh√´ fell in 1478, Shkod√´r during 1478‚Äì79 and Durr√´s in 1501 with the bulk of their Christian population fleeing. Over the course of the sixteenth century the urban populations of these cities became primarily Muslim.. In the north, the spread of Islam was slower due to resistance from the Roman Catholic Church and the mountainous terrain which contributed to curb Muslim influence in the 16th century.. The Ottoman conquest and territorial reorganisation of Albania though affected the Catholic church as ecclesiastical structures were decimated.. In the 16th century, the sanjak of Shkod√´r was reported as having a Muslim population standing at 4.5% of the total, while Dukagjini (sparsely populated at the time) had 0% and Prizreni had 1.9%. Catholic Albanian rebellions, often in the context of Ottoman wars with Catholic powers of Venice and Austria in the seventeenth century resulted in severe reprisals against Catholic Albanians who had rebelled which accentuated conversion to Islam. In 1594, the Pope incited a failed rebellion among Catholic Albanians in the North, promising help from Spain. However the assistance did not come, and when the rebellion was crushed in 1596, Ottoman repression and heavy pressures to convert to Islam were implemented to punish the rebels. Steep decreases occurred during the 1630s-1670s where for example the number of Catholics in the diocese of Lezh√´ declined by 50%, whereas in the diocese of Pult Catholics went from being 20,000 to 4,045 adherents, with most converting to Islam and a few to Orthodoxy.. \\"Then, in 1644, war broke out between Venice and the Ottoman empire. At the urging of the clergy, many Albanian Catholics sided with Venice. The Ottomans responded with severe repressions, which in turn drove many Catholics to embrace Islam (although a few elected to join the Orthodox Church instead)... Within the span of twenty-two years (1649-71) the number of Catholics in the diocese of Alessio fell by more than 50 percent, while in the diocese of Pulati (1634-71) the number of Catholics declined from more than 20,000 to just 4,045. In general, Albanian insurrections during the Ottoman- Venetian wars of 1644-69 resulted in stiff Ottoman reprisals against Catholics in northern Albania and significantly accelerated Islamization... In general, a pattern emerged. When the, Ottoman empire was attacked by Catholic powers, local Catholics were pressured to convert, and when the attack on the Ottoman empire came from Orthodox Russia, the pressure was on local Orthodox to change faith. In some cases Islamization was only superficial, however, and in the nineteenth century many villages and some entire districts remained \\"crypto- Catholic\\" in spite of the adopting the externals of Islamic culture.\\" During the Great Austro-Turkish War, Albanian Catholic leaders Pjet√´r Bogdani and Toma Raspasani rallied Kosovo Albanian Catholics and Muslims to the pro- Austrian cause. After the war, when Kosovo did not end up part of the Habsburg empire, harsh reprisals followed. Large numbers of Catholics and Serbs fled north where many \\"died, some of hunger, others of disease\\" around Budapest. After the flight of Serbs, the Pasha of Ipek (Albanian Peja, Serbian Pec) forced Catholic Albanians in the North to move to the now depopulated plains of Southern Serbia, and forced them to convert to Islam there.Pahumi, Nevila (2007). \\"The Consolidation of Albanian Nationalism\\". Page 18: \\"The pasha of Ipek forcibly removed Catholic inhabitants of northern Albania into the plains of southern Serbia after a failed Serb revolt in 1689 and the flight of many Serbs to the Habsburg Empire. The transferred villagers were forced to convert over to Islam.\\" Conversion among Catholics in communities of Northern Albania involved males outwardly embracing Islam, often to avoid payment of taxes and other social pressures which in the Ottoman system targeted men while females of the household remained Christian. Christian wives were sought by converted Muslim men to retain a degree of Catholicism in the household.. In 1703 pope Clement XI, himself of Albanian heritage, ordered a synod of local Catholic bishops that discussed stemming conversions to Islam which also agreed to deny communion to crypto-Catholics in Albania who outwardly professed Islam.. In Northern Albania, conflict with Slavs emerged as an additional factor toward conversion to Islam. Sharing the faith of Ottoman authorities allowed northern Albanians to become allies and equals in the imperial system and gain security against neighbouring Orthodox Slavs. In some areas adjacent to the east of Northern Albania, Islam became the majority faith faster: for example, official Ottoman statistics of Nahiya of Tetova across the border with Macedonia (which had a mixed Albanian, Slavic Macedonian, and Turkish population) show Muslim families outnumbering Christian families for the first time in 1545, where there are 2 more Muslim families than Christian families, and 38 of the Muslim families had recently converted from Christianity, while in Opoja in Kosovo near Prizren, Muslims are shown to have the majority in 1591.TKGM, TD ‚Ññ 55 (412), (Defter sand≈æaka Prizren iz 1591. godine).  Central Albania  Lead mosque in Berat Consisting of plains and being an in between area of northern and southern Albania, central Albania was a hub on the old Via Egnatia road that linked commercial, cultural and transport connections which were subject to direct Ottoman administrative control and religious Muslim influence. The conversion to Islam of most of central Albania has thus been attributed in large part to the role its geography played in the socio-political and economic fortunes of the region.. The official Ottoman recognition of the Orthodox church resulted in the Orthodox population being tolerated until the late 18th century, and the traditionalism of the church's institutions slowed the process of conversion to Islam amongst Albanians.. The Orthodox population of central and south-eastern Albania was under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid, while south-western Albania was under the Patriarchate of Constantinople through the Metropolis of Ioannina.. Differences between Christian Albanians of central Albania and archbishops of Ohrid led to conversions to Bektashi Islam that made an appeal to all while insisting little on ritual observance..\\"But the difficult archbishops of Ohrid must have produced some difference in their flocks. Less contentious faiths were available. It so happens that converting to Islam in central Albania was eased by the strength there of the Bektashi cult, a mystical faith, designed to appeal to all, demanding little in the way of strict rules of observance.\\" In the early 16th century the Albanian cities of Gjirokast√´r, Kanin√´, Delvin√´, Vlor√´, Kor√ß√´, K√´lcyr√´, P√´rmet and Berat were still Christian and by the late 16th century Vlor√´, P√´rmet and Himar√´ were still Christian, while Gjirokast√´r increasingly became Muslim.. In the earlier parts of the 16th century, the sanjak of Elbasan was reported as having a 5.5% Muslim population, the highest at the time of all the Albanian-inhabited sanjaks. In 1570, a concerted effort by Ottoman authorities to convert the restive Christian populations of Elbasan and Reka began. In the area around Durr√´s, it was reported by a Greek traveler that there were no longer any Orthodox Christians due to Islamization.. On Durres: \\"At the end of the 16th century conversion to Islam had so much penetrated into central Albania, that a Greek traveller in Durr√´s in 1580 reported that ‚Äïin the region of Durr√´s there are no Greeks‚Äñ (that is, Orthodox Christians)\\" Conversion to Islam in cities overall within Albania was slow during the 16th century as around only 38% of the urban population had become Muslim.. The city of Berat from 1670 onward became mainly Muslim and its conversion is attributed in part to a lack of Christian priests being able to provide religious services.  Southern Albania  In the 16th century, the sanjaks of Vlora was found to be 1.8% Muslim while the sanjak of Ohrid was found to be 1.9%. It was mainly during the late eighteenth century however that Orthodox Albanians converted in large numbers to Islam due overwhelmingly to the Russo-Turkish wars of the period and events like the Russian instigated Orlov revolt (1770) that made the Ottomans view the Orthodox population as allies of Russia. As some Orthodox Albanians rebelled against the Ottoman Empire, the Porte responded with and at times applied force to convert Orthodox Albanians to Islam while also implementing economic measures to stimulate religious conversion.. By 1798 a massacre perpetrated against the coastal Orthodox Albanian villages of Sh√´nvasil and Nivic√´-Bubar by Ali Pasha, semi-independent ruler of the Pashalik of Yanina led to another sizable wave of conversions of Orthodox Albanians to Islam.. \\"The Ottoman conquest between the end of the fourteenth century and the mid-fifteenth century introduced a third religion ‚Äì Islam - but the Turks did not at first use force in its expansion, and it was only in the 1600s that large-scale conversion to Islam began ‚Äì chiefly, at first, among Albanian Catholics.\\"; p.204. \\"The Orthodox community enjoyed broad toleration at the hands of the Sublime Porte until the late eighteenth century.\\"; p. 204. \\"In the late eighteenth century Russian agents began stirring up the Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman empire against the Sublime Porte. In the Russo-Turkish wars of 1768-74 and 1787-91 Orthodox Albanians rose against the Turks. In the course of the second revolt the \\"New Academy\\" in Voskopoje was destroyed (1789), and at the end of the second Russo-Turkish war more than a thousand Orthodox fled to Russia on Russian warships. As a result of these revolts, the Porte now applied force to Islamicize the Albanian Orthodox population, adding economic incentives to provide positive stimulus. In 1798 Ali Pasha of Janina led Ottoman forces against Christian believers assembled in their churches to celebrate Easter in the villages of Shen Vasil and Nivica e Bubarit. The bloodbath unleashed against these believers frightened Albanian Christians in other districts and inspired a new wave of mass conversions to Islam.\\". In the 19th century, Albania as a whole, and especially Southern Albania, was notable as a rare region in the Ottoman Balkans where the Christian population was still losing considerable numbers of adherents to Islamization; the only other such region that showed similar decrease in the Christian population was Dobrudja. During this time conflict between newly converted Muslim Albanians and Orthodox Albanians occurred in certain areas. Examples include the coastal villages of Borsh attacking Piqeras in 1744, making some flee abroad to places such as southern Italy.. Other areas such as 36 villages north of the Pogoni area converted in 1760 and followed it up with an attack on Orthodox Christian villages of the Kolonj√´, Leskovik and P√´rmet areas leaving many settlements sacked and ruined.. By the late eighteenth century socio-political and economic crises alongside nominal Ottoman government control resulted in local banditry and Muslim Albanian bands raided Greek, Vlach and Orthodox Albanian settlements located today within and outside contemporary Albania. Within Albania those raids culminated in Vithkuq, mainly an Orthodox Albanian centre, Moscopole (Albanian: Voskopoj√´) mainly a Vlach centre, both with Greek literary, educational and religious culture and other smaller settlements being destroyed. Those events pushed some Vlachs and Orthodox Albanians to migrate afar to places such as Macedonia, Thrace and so on.... \\"Particularly interesting is the case of Vithkuq, south of Moschopolis, which seems to have shared closely in the town's evolution, though it is far from clear whether it was inhabited by Vlachs in the glory days before 1769. It may well have had Vlach inhabitants before 1769, though the Arvanites were certainly far more numerous, if not the largest population group. This is further supported by the linguistic identity of the refugees who fled Vithkuq and accompanied the waves of departing Vlachs. Today it is inhabited by Arvanites and Vlachs, though the forebears of the modern Vlach residents arrived after the village had been abandoned by its previous inhabitants and are mainly of Arvanitovlach descent. They are former pastoral nomads who settled permanently in Vithkuq.\\"; p. 339. \\"As the same time as, or possibly shortly before or after, these events in Moschopolis, unruly Arnauts also attacked the smaller Vlach and Arvanitic communities round about. The Vlach inhabitants of Lleng√´, Ni√ß√´, Grabov√´, Shipck√´, and the Vlach villages on Grammos, such as Nikolic√´, Linotopi, and Grammousta, and the inhabitants of Vithkuq and even the last Albanian speaking Christian villages on Opar found themselves at the mercy of the predatory Arnauts, whom no-one could withstand. For them too, the only solution was to flee... During this period, Vlach and Arvanite families from the surrounding ruined market towns and villages settled alongside the few Moscopolitans who had returned. Refugee families came from Dushar and other villages in Opar, from Vithkuq, Grabov√´, Nikolic√´, Ni√ß√´, and Lleng√´ and from Kolonj√´.\\".. \\"Of these Vithkuq... All these villages have a Vlach element in their population, and it is Vlach tradition that they were large and important... This culture was of course Greek culture... Some Orthodox individuals, known as neo-martyrs, attempted to stem the tide of conversion to Islam amongst the Orthodox Albanian population and were executed in the process. Notable among these individuals was Cosmas of Aetolia, (died 1779) a Greek monk and missionary who traveled and preached afar as Kruj√´, opened many Greek schools before being accused as a Russian agent and executed by Ottoman Muslim Albanian authorities. Cosmas advocated for Greek education and spread of Greek language among illiterate Christian non-Greek speaking peoples so that they could understand the scriptures, liturgy and thereby remain Orthodox while his spiritual message is revered among contemporary Orthodox Albanians....  Other factors for conversion  Prayer In The House Of An Arnaut Chief by Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me (1857) Other conversions such as those in the region of Lab√´ria occurred due to ecclesiastical matters when for example during a famine the local bishop refused to grant a break in the fast to consume milk with threats of hell. Conversion to Islam also was undertaken for economic reasons which offered a way out of heavy taxation such as the jizya or poll tax and other difficult Ottoman measures imposed on Christians while opening up opportunities such as wealth accumulation and so on.. In times of conflict between Muslims and Christians, local interests such as protection of family predominated over fighting causing the Ottomans to refuse Muslim Albanians the bearing of arms as often Christian Albanians would convert to Islam to obtain the right to arms and then employ them against the Ottomans.. Other multiple factors that led to conversions to Islam were the poverty of the Church, illiterate clergy, a lack of clergy in some areas and worship in a language other than Albanian.. Additionally the reliance of the bishoprics of Durr√´s and southern Albania upon the declining Archbishopric of Ohrid, due in part to simony weakened the ability of Orthodox Albanians in resisting conversion to Islam.. Crypto- Christianity also occurred in certain instances throughout Albania in regions such as Shpat amongst populations that had recently converted from Christian Catholicism and Orthodoxy to Islam... Gor√´, a borderland region straddling contemporary north-eastern Albania and southern Kosovo, had a Slavic Orthodox population which converted to Islam during the latter half of the eighteenth century due to the abolition of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá (1766) and subsequent unstable ecclesiastical structures.. Whereas starting from the seventeenth and increasing in the following centuries, the mainly Slavic Orthodox population of the now Albanian borderland central-eastern region of Gollobord√´ converted to Islam.. The Romani people entered Albania sometime in the fifteenth century and those that were Muslim became part of local Muslim Ottoman society...  Muslim Albanians and the wider Ottoman world  Islam was closely associated with the state that made the Ottoman Empire an Islamic polity of which religious law coincided alongside state law with only Muslims having full civic rights while ethnic or national affiliations were disregarded.. In the center and south by the end of the seventeenth century the urban centers had largely adopted the religion of the growing Muslim Albanian elite. The construction of mosques in Albania increased substantially from the 17th century onward with the advent of large numbers of Muslim Albanian converts. The Albanian old aristocratic ruling class converted to Islam to retain their lands.. By the 18th century a class of local aristocratic Albanian Muslim notables had emerged.. The existence of that class as pashas and beys during that period, having military employment as soldiers and mercenaries while also able to join the Muslim clergy played an increasingly important role in Ottoman political and economic life that became an attractive career option for many Albanians.. Depending on their role, these people in Muslim Albanian society attained a respectable position as they performed administrative tasks and maintained security in urban areas and sometimes were rewarded by the Ottoman state with high ranks and positions.. Albanians, as such were also represented in sizable numbers at the imperial Ottoman court.. Alongside Christians though, many Muslim Albanians were poor and partially serfs that worked on the land of the emerging landowning Ottoman Albanian elite while others found employment in business, as artisans and in other jobs.. Sunni Islam was promoted and protected by Ottoman governors and feudal society that resulted in support and spread of dervish Sufi orders considered more orthodox in the Balkans region.. Foremost of these were the Bektashi order who were considered Sunni by means of association with shared legal traditions, though viewed as Shiite by everyday Muslims due to esoteric practices such as revering Ali, Hassan, Husein and other notable Muslim figures... During Ottoman rule the Albanian population partially and gradually began to convert to Islam through the teachings of Bektashism in part to gain advantages in the Ottoman trade networks, bureaucracy and army.. Many Albanians were recruited into the Ottoman Dev≈üirme and Janissary with 42 Grand Viziers of the Ottoman Empire being of Albanian origin. The most prominent Albanians during Ottoman rule were Koca Davud Pasha, Hamza Kastrioti, Iljaz Hoxha, K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha, Ali Pasha, Edhem Pasha, Ibrahim Pasha of Berat, K√∂pr√ºl√º Fazƒ±l Ahmed, Muhammad Ali of Egypt, Kara Mahmud Bushati and Ahmet Kurt Pasha. Within these contexts of serving in the military and as administrators, the relationship of Muslim Albanians with the Ottomans was at times one of cooperation and mutual advantage.. \\"Modern historians would also think it necessary to refer to the many examples of cooperation (sometimes to mutual advantage) between inhabitants of the Albanian lands and their foreign rulers - above all, in the case of the Ottomans, with their innumerable soldiers and officials of Albanian origin.

Muslim denominations and sects  Besides those associated with Sunni Islam, the Muslims of Albania during the Ottoman period belonged to several Sufi Orders. The Qadiri order spread within urban areas of the seventeenth century and was linked with guilds of urban workers while in the 18th century the Qadiri had spread into central Albania and in particular the mountainous Dib√´r region. The Qadiri contributed to the economic, and in the Dib√´r area, the socio-political milieu where they were based. The Halveti order who competed with the Bektashis for adherents and based in the south and northeast of Albania.. Other Sufi orders were the Rufai and the Melami and so on. The most prominent of these in Albania were and still are the Bektashis, a mystic Dervish order belonging to Shia Islam that came to Albania during the Ottoman period, brought first by the Janissaries in the 15th century. The spread of Bektashism amongst the Albanian population though occurred during the 18th and mainly early 19th centuries, especially in the domains of Ali Pasha who is thought to have been a Bektashi himself... Sufi dervishes from places afar like Khorasan and Anatolia arrived, proselytized, gained disciples and in time a network of tekkes was established that became centres of Sufism in regions such as Skrapar and Devoll. Some of the most prominent tekkes in Albania were in settlements such as Gjirokast√´r, Mel√ßan, Kruj√´ and Frash√´r. Of the Bektashi order by the early 20th century Albanians formed a sizable amount of its dervishes outside the Balkans, even at the tekke of Sufi saint Haji Bektash in Anatolia and in Egypt... Sufi orders, in particular the Bektashis, associate Christian saints and their local shrines with Sufi holy men, creating a synthesis and syncretism of religious observance and presence.. For Albanian converts to Islam, Bektashism with its greater religious freedoms and syncretism was viewed at times as a more appealing option than Sunni Islam... The Bektashi sect is considered heretical by conservative Muslims.. Traditionally Bektashis are found in sizable numbers within southern Albania and to a lesser extent in central Albania, while the rest of the Muslim population belongs to Sunni Islam..

Social and cultural change  Mirahori Mosque in Kor√ß√´ The Ottoman conquest also brought social, cultural and linguistic changes into the Albanian-speaking world. From the fifteenth century onward words from Ottoman Turkish entered the Albanian language. A corpus of poets and other Muslim Albanian authors wrote in Ottoman Turkish, Arabic, Persian or in the Albanian language in Arabic script (aljamiado) encompassing narrative prose, poetry, reflective works on religion and socio-political situations and so on.. Prominent amongst these authors were Yahya bey Dukagjini, Haxhi Shehreti or bejtexhinj poets like Nezim Frakulla, Muhamet Ky√ßyku, Sulejman Naibi, Hasan Zyko Kamberi, Haxhi Ymer Kashari and others. Apart from Elbasan founded (1466) around a fortress, towns and cities in Albania underwent change as they adopted Ottoman architectural and cultural elements.. Some settlements with the construction of buildings related to religion, education and social purposes like mosques, madrassas, imarets and so on by the Ottoman Muslim Albanian elite became new urban centres like Kor√ß√´, Tiran√´ and Kavaj√´.. Meanwhile, older urban centres such as Berat attained mosques, hamams (Ottoman bathhouses), madrasas (Muslim religious schools), coffee houses, tekes and became known for poets, artists and scholarly pursuits.. Unlike Kosovo or Macedonia, architecturally Albania's Ottoman Muslim heritage was more modest in number, though prominent structures are the Mirahori Mosque in Kor√ß√´ (built 1495‚Äì96), Murad Bey Mosque in Kruj√´ (1533‚Äì34), Lead Mosque in Shkod√´r (1773‚Äì74), Et'hem Bey Mosque in Tiran√´ (begun 1791‚Äì94; finished 1820‚Äì21) and others... Conversion from Christianity to Islam for Albanians also marked a transition from Rum (Christian) to Muslim confessional communities within the Ottoman millet system that collectively divided and governed peoples according to their religion. The Ottomans were nonetheless aware of the existence of Muslim Albanians and used terms like Arnavud (ÿßÿ±ŸàÿßŸÜŸäÿØ) extensively as an ethnic marker to address the shortcomings of the usual millet religious terminology to identify people in Ottoman state records.. \\"This Albanian participation in brigandage is easier to track than for many other social groups in Ottoman lands, because Albanian (Arnavud) was one of the relatively few ethnic markers regularly added to the usual religious (Muslim-Zimmi) tags used to identify people in state records. These records show that the magnitude of banditry involving Albanians grew through the 1770s and 1780s to reach crisis proportions in the 1790s and 1800s.\\"; p.107. \\"In light of the recent violent troubles in Kosovo and Macedonia and the strong emotions tied to them, readers are urged most emphatically not to draw either of two unwarranted conclusions from this article: that Albanians are somehow inherently inclined to banditry, or that the extent of Ottoman \\"Albania\\" or Arnavudluk (which included parts of present-day northern Greece, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, Kosovo, and southern Serbia) gives any historical \\"justification\\" for the creation of a \\"Greater Albania\\" today.\\" In Ottoman Turkish, the country was referred to as Arnavudluk (ÿ¢ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸàŸàÿØŸÑŸÇ).. \\"In this case, however, Ottoman records contain useful information about the ethnicities of the leading actors in the story. In comparison with ‚ÄòSerbs‚Äô, who were not a meaningful category to the Ottoman state, its records refer to ‚ÄòAlbanians‚Äô more frequently than to many other cultural or linguistic groups. The term ‚ÄòArnavud‚Äô was used to denote persons who spoke one of the dialects of Albanian, came from mountainous country in the western Balkans (referred to as ‚ÄòArnavudluk‚Äô, and including not only the area now forming the state of Albania but also neighbouring parts of Greece, Macedonia, Kosovo, and Montenegro), organized society on the strength of blood ties (family, clan, tribe), engaged predominantly in a mix of settled agriculture and livestock herding, and were notable fighters ‚Äî a group, in short, difficult to control. Other peoples, such as Georgians, Ahkhaz, Circassians, Tatars, Kurds, and Bedouin Arabs who were frequently identified by their ethnicity, shared similar cultural traits.\\" Also a new and generalised response by Albanians based on ethnic and linguistic consciousness to this new and different Ottoman world emerging around them was a change in ethnonym. The ethnic demonym Shqiptar√´, derived from Latin connoting clear speech and verbal understanding gradually replaced Arb√´resh/Arb√´nesh amongst Albanian speakers between the late 17th and early 18th centuries.. \\"They called themselves arb√´nesh, arb√´resh, the country Arb√´ni, Arb√´ri, and the language arb√´neshe, arb√´reshe. In the foreign languages, the Middle Ages denominations of these names survived, but for the Albanians they were substituted by shqiptar√´, Shqip√´ri and shqipe. The primary root is the adverb shqip, meaning \\"clearly, intelligibly\\". There is a very close semantic parallel to this in the German noun Deutsche, \\"the Germans\\" and \\"the German language\\" (Lloshi 1984) Shqip spread out from the north to the south, and Shqipni/Shqip√´ri is probably a collective noun, following the common pattern of Arb√´ni, Arb√´ri. The change happened after the Ottoman conquest because of the conflict in the whole line of the political, social, economic, religious, and cultural spheres with a totally alien world of the Oriental type. A new and more generalised ethnic and linguistic consciousness of all these people responded to this.\\"  Legacy = Albanian societal views of the Islamisation of Albania  Minbar within richly decorated interior of Et'hem Bey Mosque, Tiran√´. Islam and the Ottoman legacy has also been a topic of conversation among wider Albanian society. Islam and the Ottomans are viewed by many Albanians as the outcome of jihad, anti-Christian violence, Turkification and within those discourses Albania's sociopolitical problems are attributed as the outcome of that legacy.. Some members from the Muslim community, while deemphasizing the Ottoman past, have responded to these views by criticizing what they perceive as prejudice toward Islam. Among Albanian intellectuals and other notable Albanians in the wider Balkans, discussions and at times debates about Islam, its legacy and role within Albania have occurred.. Within these discourses, controversial Orientalist, racist and biological terminology has been used by some Albanian intellectuals when discussing Islam, its legacy and contemporary role among Albanians... Ismail Kadare Prominent in those discussions were written exchanges in newspaper articles and books between novelist Ismail Kadare of Gjirokast√´r and literary critic Rexhep Qosja, an Albanian from the former Yugoslavia in the mid-2000s. Kadare asserted that Albania's future lay with Europe due to its ancient European roots and Christian traditions, while Qosja contended that Albanian identity was both a blend of Western (Christian) and Eastern (Islam) cultures and often adaptable to historical contexts.. Piro Misha wrote that the Islamisation of Albanians during the 17th and 18th centuries as being \\"two of the darkest centuries in the modern history of Albania\\".. Misha also maintained that due to that experience \\"Albania was more influenced by Turco- Oriental culture than perhaps any other country in the region\\",. though he notes that Albanian Muslims were only Muslim group \\"in European Turkey who made common cause with their Christian compatriots to fight against the government in Constantinople.\\". In a 2005 speech given in Britain by president, Alfred Moisiu referred to Islam in Albania as having a \\"European face\\", it being \\"shallow\\" and that \\"if you dig a bit in every Albanian, he can discover his Christian core\\". The Muslim Forum of Albania responded to those and Kadare's comments and referred to them as \\"racist\\" containing \\"Islamophobia\\" and being \\"deeply offensive\\".. Following trends dating back from the communist regime, the post-communist Albanian political establishment continues to approach Islam as the faith of the Ottoman \\"invader\\".. Some Albanian writers have also claimed that the Albanian dedication to Islam was superficial and these arguments have been popular within the Orthodox and Catholic Albanian communities.. \\"Even more confusing was his deployment of another standard argument, using the evidence of syncretistic folk-religion to suggest that the Albanian commitment to Islam was only superficial: ‚ÄòThe Albanian Moslem has never forgotten ... his former religion to some of the saints of which he still pays tribute, such as St. George ... and St. Demeter. This argument (understandably popular among Catholic and Orthodox Albanians, but, in view of the use made of it by Slav and Greek propagandists, a dangerous one for Albanian interests) raised a potentially awkward question. If the Albanians had been so devoted to Christianity (which was at one stage their national religion), why had so many of them converted to Islam?\\" In debates over Albanian school textbooks where some historians have asked for offensive content regarding Turks to be removed, some Christian Albanian historians countered angrily by referring to negative experiences of the Ottoman period and wanting Turkey to seek redress for the \\"invasion\\" of Albania and Islamisation of Albanians..  Religious establishment views of the Islamisation of Albania  The official religious Christian and Muslim establishments and their clergy hold diverging views of the Ottoman period and conversion of Islam by Albanians. Both Catholic and the Orthodox clergy interpret the Ottoman era as a repressive one that contained anti-Christian discrimination and violence, while Islam is viewed as foreign challenging Albanian tradition and cohesion. The conversion to Islam by Albanians is viewed by both Catholic and Orthodox clergy as falsification of Albanian identity, though Albanian Muslims are interpreted as innocent victims of Islamisation. Albanian Sunni Muslim clergy however views the conversion of Albanians as a voluntary process, while sidelining religious controversies associated with the Ottoman era. \\"The Muslim leaders advocate the view that the Albanians' embracing of Islam was voluntary. The Christians, conversely, characterise the Ottoman rule as anti-Christian and oppressive.\\"; pp. 238-239; p. 241. \\"In Christian narratives, by contrast, Islam represents a foreign element disrupting Albanian unity and tradition.\\"; pp. 240-241. Sufi Islam in Albania interprets the Ottoman era as promoting a distorted form of Islam that was corrupted within a Sunni Ottoman polity that persecuted them.. Christian clergy consider Muslim Albanians as part of the wider Albanian nation and Muslim clergy do not express derision to people who did not become Muslim in Albania.. \\"The Christians‚Äô view that the historical conversion to Islam presents a kind of falsification of national identity has interesting similarities with Serbian nationalist interpretations of Slavic conversions to Islam, though the Albanian clergy distinguish between Islam and local Muslims and not consider their compatriots‚Äô conversion as treason to the same extent. Although the Christian leaders do place Islam on the wrong side of history, its Albanian adherents are portrayed as innocent victims of the cruel polities of foreign intruders. Moreover, the Christian clergy do not exclude Albanian Muslims from the national community, and by the same token none of the Muslim leaders seem to nurture any resentment towards those who did not embrace Islam.\\" Christian identities in Albania have been forged on being in a minority position, at times with experiences of discrimination they have had historically in relation to the Muslim majority. Meanwhile, Muslim clergy in Albania highlight the change of fortune the demise of the Ottoman Empire brought with the political empowerment of Balkan Christians making Muslims a religious minority in contemporary times.. \\"Myths of martyrdom and \\"unjust treatment\\" in the sense that the national and/or the religious community is a \\"victim of aggression\\", run like a thread through the clerics‚Äô discourse. These are partly based on the historical fact that in one way or another each community is or has been under threat: since the second half of the 19th Century, Albania and Albanians in the Balkans have been in the firing line of Christian neighbours with territorial claims, which have made efforts to assimilate, expel or even kill the population in disputed areas. This is reflected in the Communities‚Äô constructions of the national community. Orthodox and Catholic identities are shaped by the fact that Christianity is a minority religion in Albania, and that the country‚Äôs Christians have a long history as second class citizens under various forms of Muslim pressures, either as imperial, Islamist polity or under authoritarian leadership dominated by leaders with a Muslim background (Zogu and Hoxha). Conversely, the Muslim clerics focus on how the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire has given the Balkans‚Äôs Christians the upper hand politically. Islam is also a minority religion in Europe with a historical reputation as demonic and with a modern image problem in the West related to the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and global terrorist networks.\\"  Islamisation of Albania within scholarship  Within scholarship in contemporary times, the conversion of Albanians and the legacy of Islam within Albania is a contested topic. Communist era and contemporary Albanian scholars with nationalist perspectives interpret the Ottoman period as negative and downplay the conversion to Islam as having had barely any benefits to Albanians in a socio-cultural and religious sense. In 1975, Hasan Kaleshi challenged these mainly \\"negative\\" views of the period of Islamization. Kaleshi, whose views were later supported by Elsie and Schmidt- Neke, \\"Hasan Kaleshi who argued that the islamization of the majority of the Albanians saved them from assimilation into Greeks and Slavs (Kaleshi 1975).\\". \\"Modern Albanian scholars tend to view the consequences of these centuries of Turkish rule as completely negative, in terms of wild Asiatic hordes ravaging and plundering a country which might otherwise have flourished in the cradle of European civilization... Scholar Hasan Kaleshi (1922‚Äì1976) has convincingly suggested that the Turkish occupation of the Balkans had at least the one positive consequence. It saved the Albanians from ethnic assimilation by the Slavs, just as the Slavic invasion of the Balkans in the sixth century had put an end to the process of Romanization which had threatened to assimilate the non-Latin-speaking ancestors of the Albanians a thousand years earlier. Although not recognized by the Turks as an ethnic minority (the population of the Ottoman Empire was divided according to religion, not according to nationality), the Albanians managed to survive as a people and indeed substantially expand their areas of settlement under Turkish rule.\\" stated that the Ottoman conquest and conversion to Islam by Albanians averted Hellenization and Slavification the same way that he argued that the Slavic invasions of the 6th century halted the romanization process of the progenitors of the Albanians. Kaleshi maintained that though recognised within the millet system as Muslims only, the partial Islamisation of the population halted the assimilation process occurring through churches and the influence of landlords of the Greeks, Latins and Slavs. Additionally the Islamisation of Albanians also resulted in the extension of the Balkan Albanian settlement area through either population movements or the assimilation of other Muslim non-Albanian elements during Ottoman rule. Kaleshi's thesis has over time been distorted by some Albanians who argue that Albanians converted to Islam with the aim of keeping their national and ethnic identity, instead of Albanian identity being preserved as a consequence of Islamisation and Ottoman rule; this has been called an \\"inversion\\" of Kaleshi's argument..

Vasily Perovsky set out from Orenburg with 5,000 men, met an unusually cold winter, lost most of his camels, and was forced to turn back after going halfway. Russians attacked Khiva four times. Around 1602, some free Cossacks made three raids on Khiva. In 1717, Alexander Bekovich- Cherkassky attacked Khiva and was soundly defeated, only a few men escaping to tell the tale. After the Russian defeat in 1839‚Äì1840, Khiva was finally conquered by the Russians during the Khivan campaign of 1873. Background The Khanate of Khiva was located south of the Aral Sea in the delta of the Oxus River. Here irrigation supported a population of about half a million. The problem was that Khiva was an oasis surrounded by several hundred miles of steppe and desert. The Russians could easily defeat the Khivan army but they first had to move enough troops across the steppe. General-adjutant Count V. A. Perovsky. Painting by Karl Briulov (1837) By about 1743 Russia had established itself on the Orenburg Line about 750 miles north of Khiva. Orenburg was long the base from which Russia watched and tried to control the steppes to the east and south. Over the next century they gained increasing control over the Kazakh nomads. There were the usual border disputes on a lawless frontier. The Russians complained that the Khan did not do enough to stop raiders although his ability to control them was limited. A second problem was slavery. Khiva kept a large number of Persian slaves which they bought from the Turkomans. A small number of Russians were also taken from the Orenburg Line. From the early nineteenth century an increasing number of Russian fishermen were captured on the Caspian Sea. After other attempts to pressure the Khan had failed, in August 1836 Russia ordered the arrest of all Khivan merchants in Russian territory ‚Äì about 572 people and 1,400,000 silver rubles in goods. The Khan was told that his subjects would be released when all Russian slaves were released. In late September the Khan said he would release his Russians, but when the caravan arrived there were only 25, almost all old men who had been in slavery for 30 or 40 years. Five more were released in 1838 and 80 more in August 1839. On 24 March 1839 the czar approved an attack on Khiva. The goal was not annexation but, if possible, to replace the current Khan with a Kazakh loyal to Russia. The final plan was approved on 10 October. Preparations The land around Khiva has enough grass and water to support a thin nomadic population, but not enough for an army. The troops would have to carry nearly everything with them. As one moves south grass and water diminish, as did Russian knowledge of the ground, an important matter for an army marching from one waterhole to the next. Since the grass died down in summer, spring and fall were the best times for travel. Winter was sometimes preferred to reduce the need for water. Winter snow and cold are not too bad in normal years, but 1839 was not a normal year. 5000 men would be used, 3000 for the actual fighting and 2000 to guard the supply line. Orenburg was chosen as the starting point since this was the main base and had connections to the Russian heartland. Additional supplies would be taken by sea to Novo Alexandrovsk and carried east to the main column. 7750 Bashkir carts were mobilized to haul supplies to Orenburg. 10400 camels and 2000 camel drivers were requisitioned from the Kazakhs. This required military force in the case of one tribe. In June Colonel Heke went south with two companies and 1200 carts to explore the route and establish advanced depots. He reached the Emba River on 30 June and sent a smaller group forward to establish the next depot. The Aq Bulaq RiverThe locations of Fort Emba and Aq Bulaq are estimated from Yuri Bregel, An Historical Atlas of Central Asia, map 31 and a barely legible map on the last page of Anomymous. The Aq Bulaq River is one of the two springs (the other is Kok Bulaq) feeding the salty lake Shoshkakol (lake of the pigs) located 15 km north of the foot of the Ustyurt plateau (chink Dongystau, Mountain of the boar). The ruin of the pentagonal fort (330 x 380m) is visible on satellite image at the location: E57¬∞50'53.52\\"-N47¬∞02'21.50\\". The first Fort Emba was at the junction of the Emba and the Aty-Yakshi. 100 miles south was chosen and a fort was built there in August. A large amount of hay was mown and reeds and willows were collected for fuel. For 40 kilometers north of Aq Bulaq there were salt marshes with no adequate water or grass. By September a fort had been built on the Emba and hay mown. Fort Emba had a garrison of 634 men and Aq Bulaq 399. The forts were unhealthy and by December 93 men had died. On the first of November a caravan of 1128 camels left Orenburg and reached the Emba 24 days later. Campaign Some officers thought that it was too late in the seasonArticles Orenburg and Aral, Kazakhstan have climate tables for this part of the world. but the campaign proceeded anyway. On 26 November the first column left Orenburg. Three more columns left a day or two apart. The first snow fell on 2 December. On 18 December the mercury in the thermometers congealed (minus 35 Fahrenheit). The first snow storm struck on the 19th. They reached the Emba on 31 December with no deaths but numerous cases of frostbite. In the previous 27 days the temperature never rose above 12 degrees Fahrenheit. On 30 December 2,000 to 3,000 Khivans attacked Aq Bulaq. After 2 unsuccessful days they turned their attention to a supply column 17 kilometers away. When this also failed they withdrew. The Russians lost 5 killed and 13 wounded. Eighty Khivan bodies were counted. About this time some of the Kazakh camel drivers staged a mutiny. After two ringleaders were shot the rest returned to duty. Also about this time word was received from the Caspian. The supply ships had been delayed by contrary winds and had become frozen in, only two limping back to Astrakhan. Those frozen near Novo Alexandrovsk were unloaded. Those further away were burnt by a group sent from Khiva. This group then attacked those Kazakhs who were working with the Russians, thereby cutting off the supply of fresh camels. In November Aitov was sent to collect camels to haul supplies from the Caspian to Fort Emba. Returning with 538 camels his camel drivers revolted, returned the camels to their owners and sent Aitov to Khiva. By 13 January there were 202 sick on the Emba and one fifth of the camels were too weak to be used. In January the columns began leaving Fort Emba, the main one reaching Aq Bulak on 6 February, covering about 100 miles in 16 days. The temperature was well below zero Fahrenheit. Men had to walk in front of the camels to clear a path through the snow. Between the Emba and Ak Bulaq 1200 camels died and about 2500 had to be abandoned due to exhaustion. Unnecessary supplies were burnt for fuel. The cold made it impossible to wash or change clothes. In early February Bizyanov was sent about 100 miles south and reported the snow was even deeper. Of the 2750 Orenburg Infantry, who were not used to campaigning, only two thirds were fit for duty and 236 had died. Given the rate of loss of men and camels it was clear that if the army reached Khiva it would be in no condition to fight. On 13 February All dates in this article are New Style. Anonymous normally gives both Old Style and New Style dates. For this (page 156) he gives only 01February. Comparison with other dates shows that was probably Old Style. Perovsky decided to retreat. All four columns were back on the Emba by the end of February. The temperature remained below zero Fahrenheit. Roots were dug up for fuel and supplies were burned for heat. Since all the grass around Fort Emba had been consumed and there were many dead camels that would begin to rot in spring, Fort Emba was moved to a new location about 30 kilometers away. Cossacks were sent out to obtain more camels. 500 were secured by negotiation. 700 were sent from Orenburg. Bizyanov attacked the Adaev tribe at mouth of the Emba, killed 450 men, and brought back a large number of camels. By mid-May there were 3480 camels. At this time there were 1130 men sick in camp, 613 with scurvy. The troops began leaving the Emba on 30 May, encountered nothing worse than mud and by late June were dispersed along the Orenburg Line. Results: 1054 Russians died out of the original 5000. Deaths of Kazakh camel drivers are not given. Bashkir carters lost 199 men and 8869 horses.Anonymous, page 123, without explanation. He does not report Bashkirs south of Orenburg. The expedition cost 1.7 million rubles.Possibly paper or non-silver assignat rubles, since the budget, page 69, was 425000 silver rubles and 12000 gold ducats. Economic losses to the Bashkirs and Kazakhs were estimated at 2.5 million rubles each.Camels were requisitioned at 3 silver rubles each for 6 months. Anonymous does not report compensation for dead camels Of the original 10500 camels only 1500 remained alive by April. During the campaign there were 3124 cases of sickness, 608 of them mortal.Anonymous, pages 170,173,176. This is a contradiction since there were not 400 battle deaths. It was noted that the death rate for the Ural Cossacks was 1 in 200 and among the Orenburg Infantry 1 in 14, the difference being ascribed to habituation to steppe campaigning. The following year a British agent convinced the Khan to free 416 Russian slaves. The Khivan traders and their goods were released. Perovsky retained his command and in 1853 won the battle of Ak Mechet. Khiva was finally subjugated by the Khivan campaign of 1873.
