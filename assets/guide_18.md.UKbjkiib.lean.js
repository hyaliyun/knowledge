Some of his teachings were recorded in a 15th-century manuscript titled A Life of St Maighneann, an Irish saint of the seventh century. History Maighnean is thought to have lived during the first half of the 7th century CE. He set up his church on a ridge between two rivers, the River Liffey and the River Camac and presided there as abbot, though in some instances he is referred to with the title bishop. Maighneann was followed by twenty-seven monks who travelled with him during pilgrimages around the country. He visited several other Irish saints including Saint Maelruain of Tallaght, Saint Dublitir of Fingal and Saint Finnin of Strangford. While at Tallaght he made his confession to Saint Maelruain. Maelruain considered Maighneann lazy because he shied away from manual labour. Nonetheless, Maelruain praised Maighneann for keeping his ritual fire, which he kept constantly alight for over thirty years. Such was Maighneann's fame that the historic area of Kilmainham was named after his church \\"Cill Mhaighneann.\\" Subsequently two famous buildings Kilmainham Priory, established by Strongbow after his invasion in 1169, and survived until it was suppressed by Henry VIII, and The Royal Hospital Kilmainham which was built by the Duke of Ormonde in 1680 occupied the same site. Maighnean was also the subject of a 15th-century manuscript titled, A Life of St Maighneann, an Irish saint of the seventh century written by Ulliam Mac an Lega. In it, the manuscript contains a collection of his precepts on topics such as discipline and eschatology, and even a discussion on the Antichrist. Many of these discussions were derived from Maighnean's interactions with other saints that he visited during his lifetime.

The dance style in its formative phase was inseparably linked with Krishna legend. The word Kathak comes from the word katha which means \\"story\\".  History  Kathak has been closely associated with Krishna's legends. The earliest mention of Kathak as an art form is found in the Arjuna-Vanavasa chapter of the Aadi-Parva of Mahabharata. In its initial phase, Kathak is regarded to have been a mimetic representation of Puranic literature accompanied with dance. Kathakas were Granthikas reciting stories related to Vishnu. When Krishna was identified with Vishnu, Granthikas began narrating Krishna-based stories. During this time, a rich musical theater form had grown out of the rich Krishna theater tradition of Mathura region. It is believed that Katha- Vachan, the earliest form of Kathak was exclusively based on Krishna's legend.  Forms of Krishna bhakti  The bhakti centering on Krishna is of two forms: * Kanta bhava or worship of Krishna and Rukmini. * Madhura bhava or worship of Krishna and Radha. The concept of madhura bhakti where Lord is the \\"Supreme lover\\" gained popularity amongst the worshipers of Krishna. The most notable compositions are of the Ashtachhapkars. They were eight poets and the followers of Vallabhacharya and Vithalnath named as Surdas, Kumbhandas, Nandadas, Parmanandadas, Chaturbhujdas, Krishnadas, Govindswami and Chitswami. These poets produced a wealth of lyrical songs narrating the various episodes of Krishna's life with special emphasis on madhura bhava. Kathak dancers liberally use these songs in their recitals. Krishna's childhood pranks, depicted by Surdas were the epitome of Vatsalyarasa. Even while depicting shringar rasa madhura bhava, Krishna legend is shown with many splendored hues and colours. The amorous dalliance of the symbolic lovers Krishna and Radha is the meeting of Jeevatma with Parmatma. The outpourings of these saint-poets form an integral part of a Kathak dancer's repertoire.  Themes  The Krishna theme in kathak may be one of these: * Gat Nikas these depict simple stories. In Gat Bhava dancer portrays two or more characters with a half-turn. This role playing is generalized under various gats like makhan chori, paniya bharan, chedchad, ghungat (veil), murli (flute), matki (pot), etc. where Krishna is symbolized by murli or crown and Radha by ghungat or matki. * Kavita These are poems set in rhythmic cycle narrating mythological episodes like kaliya, govardhan lila, etc. where the Dancer expresses the words of the kavita with appropriate hand gestures and symbols. * Thumri These are semi- classical music compositions exhaustively covering the entire gamut of emotions, situations, expressions and episodes of Krishna legends. A thumri may showcase love of Krishna and Radha depicting them together on a swing or in a boat or playing rasa or highlight their anxiety and distress during the period of separation. Thumri highlights the prowess of a Kathak dancer and are dealt with a lot of subtlety. It is said that when Krishna danced his divine dance on the hood of the defeated serpent Kaliya, various mnemonic sounds emanated from Krishna's feet like Ta, Thai, Tat, etc. which formed the building blocks of Kathak. Krishna is also known as \\"Natwar\\", hence these sounds came to be known as Natwari.

Shanet is a Professor of Physiology and Biophysics at Weill Cornell Medical College, the holder of the Vincent and Brooke Astor Distinguished Professorship in Neuroscience at Weill Cornell Medical College, the Professor of Neuroscience for the Brain and Mind Research Institute at Weill Cornell Medical College and the first woman ever to serve as president of the American Society for Neuroscience. Shanet is famous for her studies of the transport of materials down the axon nerves and her thesis work on the mechanism of cortical spreading depression, which became a classic in its field and is acknowledged even today. Biography Shanet was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on September 17, 1929. She attended the University of Toronto starting in 1947 where she enrolled in the Physiology and Biochemistry Honors Course. She graduated from the University of Toronto in 1951 with a B.A. in Physiology. Shanet then moved on to McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada for graduate school, where she produced her well renowned thesis on the mechanism of cortical spreading depression for her PhD. She eventually received her PhD in Physiology from McGill University in 1954 under Benedict Delisle Burns, who helped Shanet work on her graduate thesis. She did postgraduate work in the Department of Anatomy at University College London for 2 years, but she returned as a junior faculty member to McGill shortly thereafter and began to work once again under Benedict Delisle Burns. As Shanet became interested in how connections among nerve cells are formed, she began to prepare herself for work in this area by studying with the eminent embryologist, Viktor Hamburger, at Washington University, and by taking the Embryology Course at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory. She was consequently invited by the well-known developmentalist, Paul Alfred Weiss, to join the faculty of The Rockefeller University, where she began her research on nervous system regeneration which has been her primary research field since then. In 1969, she joined the Department of Physiology at Weill Cornell Medical College, where she remains a Professor of Physiology and Biophysics and is now the Vincent and Brooke Astor Distinguished Professor in Neuroscience. Works During her work as a graduate student she trained as an electrophysiologist, specifically focusing on correlations between structure and function in the cerebral cortex. Then for her PhD thesis, which Shanet carried out under the guidance of Benedict Delise Burns, she worked on an electrophysiological analysis of the phenomenon of cortical spreading depression in the cerebral cortex. This phenomenon has been recognized as playing an important role in migraine, stroke and other cortical pathology. Her contributions established the role of interneuronal movement of potassium ions in propagation of spreading depression. She subsequently became interested in nervous system development and regeneration, and is known for her work on intracellular transport of protein in normal and regenerating neurons, as well as other forms of molecular signaling among various cell types in the brain. Her work on chronic changes in electrical activity following cortical injury, and the organization and development of callosal connections in the cortex were also pioneering studies in the analysis of cortical activity with respect to the underlying tissue structure. Shanet's research at Weill Cornell has been focused on the regenerating goldfish visual system, with a continuing focus on axonal transport and the role it plays in defining the process of regeneration. Throughout her career, Shanet has been interested in the association between function and structure in nervous tissue. Honors and awards Shanet is a Life Trustee and Treasurer of the Grass Foundation, a member of the Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives, and a member of the Council of the New York Hall of Science. She has been a member of the National Advisory Council of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), a Chairman of the Committee for Brain Science of the National Research Council, and a member of the Research Council's Advisory Committee for USSR and Eastern Europe. She has been a scientific adviser for voluntary health organizations concerned with central nervous system injury, such as the National Spinal Cord Injury Foundation and Paralyzed Veterans of America. The National Spinal Cord Injury Foundation twice awarded her its L.W. Freeman Award of Merit, and in 1982, she received an award from the New York Metropolitan Chapter of American Women in Science as an outstanding woman scientist. She has been honored with a number of awards for excellence in teaching given by Weill Cornell Medical College. She has been a member of the Society for Neuroscience since its start and served as a member of its Council from 1972 to 1976, as treasurer from 1977 to 1980 and as president from 1985 to 1986. Shanet received Women in Neuroscience's 2003 Mika Salpeter Lifetime Achievement Award. The Mika Salpeter Lifetime Achievement Award, honors an individual with outstanding career achievements in neuroscience, who has also significantly promoted the professional advancement of women within the field.  Personal life  Shanet was married since 1963 to Howard S. Shanet, who was a conductor, composer and Professor of Music at Columbia University, until his death in June 2006. They have a son, Laurence P. Shanet, who is a television producer and director.

Later on, Iran National Olympic Committee (N.O.C.IRAN) decided not to participate in the games, with any sports team, mentioning lack of adequate national budget, as the reason.baztab.net \\"روایت 49ساله از بودجه دولت در ورزش\\" (in Persian) In March 1963, as a prelude to selecting Iran's national boxing team for the 1964 Summer Olympics, the All - Tehran boxing competition was organized by Iran Boxing Federation, in which Pakandam defeated all his opponents and became champion of the tournament in the Welterweight division.THE TEHRAN JOURNAL, Vol. VII, 2635, page 7, Tuesday March 12, 1963 In the round of 32 of the Lightweight division of the boxing competition in the 1964 Summer Olympics, in which Pakandam represented Iran national boxing team as Iranian captain, he faced Stoyan Pilichev from Bulgaria, and due to a cut above his eye, and bleeding, the referee stopped the contest (RSC), in the third round.

Pakandam had become Iran national boxing champion in the Welterweight category a year before the 1964 Summer Olympics, whereas he participated in the boxing Lightweight division of Tokyo 1964. Non of the Iranian boxing team participants were able to reach the quarter finals. In the interview he said that in order to face experienced and powerful opponents in a tournament such as the Summer Olympics, extensive planning and preparedness was required, something the Iranian boxing team lacked at that time. The Iranian national boxing team did not have participants for all weight categories, before the tournament started, and they only participated with five boxers.

Formed in Toronto, Ontario, the band has toured throughout Canada and the United States with bands such as Animals as Leaders, Protest the Hero, Between the Buried and Me and The Contortionist. Intervals released two EPs, The Space Between (2011) and In Time (2012), and their debut full-length album A Voice Within on March 4, 2014, featuring vocals by Mike Semesky. After the exit of every band member except for guitarist Aaron Marshall, follow-up albums The Shape of Colour (2015) and The Way Forward (2017) were released. History =Formation and The Space Between EP (2011-2012)= Intervals was formed in Toronto, Ontario in 2011 as a creative outlet for guitarist Aaron Marshall after quitting his previous band, \\"Speak of the Devil\\". He recorded and programmed all the parts for The Space Between in his home studio, with mixing and mastering by Adam \\"Nolly\\" Getgood of Periphery, and released independently on December 20, 2011. Marshall attempted to form a full band including a vocalist, with the intention of turning Intervals into a touring act, but failed to do so. =In Time EP (2012-2013)= With the release of their second EP In Time on October 30, 2012, Marshall was joined by Olly Steele (Monuments) and David Maxim Micic (Destiny Potato). Sputnik Music gave the EP a 4.0/Excellent rating, suggesting that \\"if they find a bit more creativity and increase their originality, they have potential to go down in history as one of the best instrumental prog metal bands. As of now, they are still not on the same level as Animals as Leaders.\\" The band released a music video for \\"Epiphany\\" on April 25, 2013 via Guitar World promotion and YouTube. Following the success of In Time, the band gained endorsement deals from Ernie Ball Music Man, Pearl Drums, Meinl Cymbals, Toontrack, InTune Guitar Picks, and Gruv Gear. Marshall also released playthroughs and lessons for certain songs from the EP. =A Voice Within (2013-2015)= On September 14, 2013, Intervals announced they would be entering the studio with producer Jordan Valeriote (Silverstein, Structures, Counterparts) on November 4 to begin tracking their upcoming release. Following the studio, Intervals were scheduled to tour Europe (January - February 2014) with Protest The Hero, TesseracT, and The Safety Fire. On December 30, it was announced that bassist Mike Semesky would be changing his role in the band and provide vocals on the new album; as a result, the album's bass tracks were handled equally by Marshall and Valeriote. The band released Semesky's vocal debut in the form of new single ‘Ephemeral’ via RevolverMag.com, as well as a revelation that the new album would be titled A Voice Within. Due to the need for Semesky to focus entirely on his vocal performance live, the band hired Henry Selva (formerly of The Human Abstract) as their live bassist for their upcoming tours. The band released a second song from the album, \\"The Escape\\", on January 23, 2014 and announced that the album would be released on March 4, 2014. On February 26, the band announced that they would be releasing one new song from the album per day until the day of the album's release. The first of these songs was \\"The Self Surrendered\\". =Departure, The Shape of Colour, and The Way Forward (2015-present)= On November 25, 2014, Mike Semesky was announced to have left the band. An instrumental version of A Voice Within was then released on March 3, 2015. On June 23, three months after, Guyader and Sastry announced on Facebook that they would no longer be a part of Intervals. This separation was caused by different expectations about the direction of the band: Marshall then introduced new studio musicians, bassist Cameron McLellan (Protest The Hero) and drummer Travis Orbin (Darkest Hour, ex-Periphery, Sky Eats Airplane), to work on the band's next album. On December 4, 2015, Intervals released The Shape of Colour. On October 24, 2017, Intervals announced The Way Forward, a new album with McLellan returning to bass, and new drummer Nathan Bulla, who had been playing live with the band until the release. Marshall continues to be the only official member of the band, despite having returning members for tours and studio recordings.

After obtaining an Agrégation in grammar, he carried on his study of language under the direction of Joseph Vendryes. He went to Dublin for about ten years to study celtic languages and concluded his stay in Ireland by defending a PhD thesis, in 1957, at the Faculty of Letters of the University of Paris, on the syntax of the verbal noun in celtic languages.La syntaxe du nom verbal dans les langues celtiques (Syntax of the Verbal Noun in Celtic Languages. 1.

His first instance is known when King Dasharatha invited him to perform Putreshthi Yajna-for the procreation as the name suggests-and later by this gracious deed, we have four figures who are highly revered in Hindu Mythology, namely Lord Rama, Laxman, Bharat, and Shatrughna. Singirishi Samaj in Bundelkhand lives on the banks of river Betwa and Narmada in the parts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. The descendants of Shrinigirsihi Maharaj arrived in this region in 800 AD from Rajasthan. Engrossed with the Agrarian potential of the region, they started to live here and ultimately established themselves. The family names start from Nayak, Sharma, Shringirishi, Tiwari, Joshi, Pandit, Pathak, Pandey, and the like. Other descendants who still live in Rajasthan are known as Sikhwal or Sukhwal. In total, there are 64 temples or ashram devoted to Shringirishi Maharaj all over India. Specifically in the region of Bundelkhand, the descendants have kept the image of Shringirishi Maharaj alive by constructing four temples in: Kharela, Baruasagar Hamirpur and Sangauli. Shringirishi Temples =Temple in Kharela= In Vikram Samvat 972, it is believed that a Shringirshi temple was constructed in village Kharela which lies in Mahoba District in Uttar Pradesh. According to Mahabharat, Kharela is assumed to be the capital of the kingdom of King Virat. Pandavas, while serving exile, took shelter here in this kingdom. The Shringirishi Temple lies in the middle of the village. The locals call it Mahamuni ki Gaddi. In the month of Shravana (July–August), Kajali fair is celebrated annually. =Temple in Baruasagar= Second biggest Shringirishi temple in the Bundelkhand region is in the small town of Baruasagar, which is about 30 km from Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh. Under Swami Sharnanand Ji Maharaj, this temple came into existence on 15 June 1979. Though the temple is not old, its popularity transcend beyond the descendants of Shringirishi Maharaj. The site is famous for a cascade, thus the place is called as Jharna. Each year on the occasion of Guru Purnima, the Shringirishi Community gather for celebrating the life and works of Shringirishi Maharaj. =Temple in Khurai= Third temple in Khurai, which lies in District Sagar in the state of Madhya Pradesh finished construction on 15 May 2005. =Temple in Sangouli= Recent edition of Shringirishi Maharaj Temple is in the village of Sangouli, which is about 80 km from Jhansi in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The temple is situated on a small hill alongside the temple of Lord Hanumana. The speciality of this temple is that it has not only the idol of Shringirishi Maharaj but also one of his wife Shanta. Culture & History These temples extend their existence from one corner of Bundelkhand region to other. Annual occasions hosted in these temples serve the purpose of uniting the descendants of Bundelkhand with the Sikhwal Samaj. On a historic note, these temples are the evidence of the spread of civilization from its origin to its survival.

Gunter: Historical Dictionary of the Kurds, 2011 (page 220), visited on 13.08.2013 With his sentimental, traditional and often political lyrics he created great Kurdish music like few before him. His work is still well-known and listened to today.  Biography  = Childhood and Youth = The Kurdish singer Mihemed Salih Şêxmûs was born 1948 in Qamishlo, a city in Syria's northern region which is called Western Kurdistan by Kurds. He was from a poor family and had to work in agriculture. In his early childhood he plowed in the farm of his uncle, to support his family financially. Because of lack of money Mihemed Sexo could go to school only up to the sixth class. Among his teachers, he was considered a pious intelligent boy. Subsequently, he moved with his family to the city where he continued to work. In 1965, he was able to attend a middle school. Sexo there was one of the best students of his school. But again, because of financial problems he ended his academic career after the ninth grade. The young student especially was interested in the music, so he admired Kurdish musician. The music of the Kurdish-Armenian singer Aram Tigran aroused a special sympathy for him. With 19 years Mihemed Sexo learned to play the hand Tembûr (saz), which is a major in the Kurdish music stringed instrument to play. Often, the young talented artist had performed at weddings. = Exile in Lebanon = In 1969 Mihemed Şêxo emigrated to Lebanon. In the Lebanese capital Beirut he began to study music. Influenced by his patriotic stance he mainly made music in the Kurdish language. In Lebanon, his talent fascinated dozens of people. Although there were multiple offers for him to participate in well- known groups, however, he decided to return to his home. = Politically motivated reprisals = As Mihemed Şêxo published songs written in Kurdish, which found wide acceptance in the Kurdish society, he was cautioned for his works by the Syrian Baath government. In 1973 he traveled to Iraq to develop his musical talent. There he played Kurdish songs on a local radio. Despite political reprisals, he moved back to his hometown. He brought out a cassette titled \\"Ay Gewere\\", whereby he again won the heart of the Kurdish people. During this time, Mihemed Şêxo was more and more interested in the Kurdish history. From then on he began to sing his songs in his home country of unfulfilled longing. Several times the Syrian police arrested him because of his music. Nevertheless, he argued, to produce songs in the Kurdish language. Because of his political identity he had to flee to South Kurdistan, where he admired the resistance of Mela Mistefa Barzanî. As Barzanî fled to Iran, Sexo decided to follow him. Allegedly he has lived in Gonbad Kavus. In Iran he became acquainted with Persian and Arabic as a teachers taught in schools. He also married a Kurdish woman. The Arabic music aroused curiosity in him. Influenced by Arabic music, he expanded his musical skills. He wanted to publish his songs free on Kurdish exactly like other famous Arab singers. After the newly formed Iranian regime sit up a policy of assimilation of the Kurdish population, Iranian security forces arrested him. Şêxo went into prison but continued to write political lyrics about his home, which were mainly about the oppression of the Kurdish people. In 1983 Mihemed Şêxo returned to Syria. Meanwhile, he was a very important Kurdish singer in Western Kurdistan. There was hardly anyone in the west of Kurdistan, who did not know his music. At that time he had already brought 14 music cassettes on the market, which had sold quickly. But his music also found encouragement in other parts of Kurdistan. In the following years Mihemed Şêxo performed at several concerts and continued to write new texts.  Death and burial  In 1989, on 9 March the Kurdish singer died after three days of illness.[http://firatnews.com/news/guncel/ayle-gule-yi-soyleyerek-mihemed- sexo-yu-andilar.htm Firatnews.com: ‘Aylê Gulê‘yi söyleyerek Mihemed Şêxo’yu andılar (They remembered Mihemed Şêxo by singing his 'Aylê Gulê') , created: 3 March 2013, read: 12 August 2013 His death caused great sorrow among the Kurds. Within two hours, more than 70,000 Kurds gathered in his hometown Qamishli to accompany to Şêxo his last honor.  Post humanum  Even today, the music of Mihemed Şêxo plays a special role in the Kurdish history. Many artists make music based on his style. His folk elements of music and often political lyrics made him a special person. Songs like \\"Ay Le Gule\\" or \\"Nesrîn\\" are still often played Kurdish music channels.Cafrande.org: Mihemed Şêxo hayatı, sanatı ve stranlarıyla (Mihemed Şêxo's life, art and songs), visited on 13.08.2013  Sources  = External links = * Kurdishmusic.eu: Some works of Mihemed Şêxo * Kurdishrights.org: Mihemed Şexo – a Kurdish Legend * Özgür Gündem: Gulê’nin özlediği bülbül: Mihemed Şêxo (Turkish) * DieKurden.de: Im Gedenken an den kurdischen Sänger Mihemed Şêxo (German) Category:1948 births Category:1989 deaths Category:20th-century singers Category:Kurdish male singers Category:20th-century male singers ","title":"Mihemed Şêxo"},{"id":"40219433","text":"Carlo de Reuver (born 29 January 1995) is a Dutch professional footballer who currently plays as a striker for vv Capelle in the Dutch Derde Divisie.

Garrett Bradley Garrett (born c. 1981) is an American social and cultural geographer at University College Dublin in Ireland and a writer for The Guardian newspaper in the United Kingdom. He describes his research interests as being at the intersections of cultural geography, archaeology and visual methods and writes that his research is about \\"finding the hidden in the world\\". He is the author of five books including Bunker: Building for the End Times, a contemporary account of doomsday preppers around the world, and Explore Everything: Place-Hacking the City, an ethnographic account of the activities of the London Consolidation Crew (LCC), a group of urban explorers Garrett calls \\"place hackers\\". In addition to his work in human geography, Garrett has published academic research papers in archaeology, history, ethics, criminology, and visual methods.  Education  Garrett received a B.S. in anthropology and B.A. in history from the University of California, Riverside in 2003 before moving to Australia to undertake an MSc in maritime archaeology at James Cook University in 2005. He did his first ethnographic research with the Winnemem Wintu tribe in Northern California about their loss of access to ancestral land inundated by the construction of Shasta Dam. He then worked for private archaeology firms in Hawaii and for the Bureau of Land Management in California as an archaeologist. In 2008, Garrett moved to the United Kingdom where he completed a PhD in social and cultural geography at Royal Holloway, University of London, with a thesis entitled Tales of Urban Exploration. He was supervised by the human geographer Tim Cresswell.  Career  Upon completion of his PhD, Garrett took up a two-year postdoctoral research post at School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford from 2012-2014, where he was a fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford. He then worked for two years at the University of Southampton before moving to the University of Sydney in Australia, where he was a research fellow and conducted multi-year ethnographic research with \\"doomsday preppers\\" building for apocalyptic scenarios. His first book is Explore Everything: Place-Hacking the City. The book describes the exploits of the LCC, as they trespassed into hundred of locations over five years in an attempt to \\"reveal the hidden city\\". The book was chosen by Rowan Moore of The Guardian as one of the best architecture books of 2013. Garrett claims the goal of this work was to re-map London by opening out vertical urban imaginations and exposing the ways in which surveillance and control are embedded in modern spatial planning. Garrett suggests surveillance is subverted and rendered inert through the urban explorer's \\"place hack\\" when control of the city is temporarily taken back through creative practice. In a 2014 TEDx talk entitled \\"Trespass is Good for Cities\\", Garrett told the audience that \\"When we explore cities, when we ignore the \\"no trespassing\\" signs and cross those borders, whether we can see them or not, we open up opportunities for critical creativity, we re-create space and we make the impossible possible.\\" Garrett was also invited to speak about his research at the Festival of Dangerous Ideas at the Sydney Opera House and at Google Zeitgeist in 2014, where he shared a session with Bill Clinton, the 42nd President of the United States. In his public lectures, Garrett describes how the LCC came to notoriety first in 2011 when they released photos of the mothballed London Post Office Railway, a 6.5-mile subterranean train network used by the Post Office to transport post across the city. Near the end of his research project, Garrett followed the LCC as they systematically infiltrated abandoned Tube stations in the London Underground without permission and posted photos online. Soon after, Garrett began appearing on UK media discussing these explorations, describing himself as \\"the scribe for the tribe\\". In a 2013 interview with Will Storr for the Daily Telegraph, Garrett described \\"place hacking\\", otherwise known as urban exploration, as a way of \\"...seeing the city like it’s a puzzle and putting the pieces of that puzzle together, connecting things\\". Garrett went on to explain that \\"...the more we feel like there are things we can’t do and places we can’t see, the more urban exploration has [a] capacity to give people hope\\". In 2015, Garrett was the recipient of the James Cook University Early Career Alumni Award for the College of Arts, Society and Education in Queensland, Australia. In February 2016 Garrett, along with writer Will Self, Green Party mayoral candidate Siân Berry, writer Anna Minton and comedian Mark Thomas, staged a mass trespass onto land owned by property group More London in protest of the privatisation of public space in the city. The group occupied a private amphitheater called The Scoop and held an unsanctioned 2-hour event for a crowd of people. On the Facebook page for the event, Garrett wrote that \\"one of the subsidiary effects of the rampant redevelopment of the city is that when the construction dust settles, often we find that open-air public spaces once maintained by civil bodies have been quietly passed into the hands of corporations as part of austerity-driven buyouts...It is time for our urban rambler moment; it is time to reclaim our cities.\\" As a result of this campaigning, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, established a charter regulating the management of privately owned public spaces in the capital. In 2016, Garrett also released a virtual reality project built in collaboration with The Guardian called \\"Underworld\\", which allows users to venture through the 'lost' Fleet River under London guided by Garrett who \\"guides users from the blood sewers beneath Smithfield Market in the City of London down to the Thames.\\" Garrett wrote a news column for Guardian Cities where public space, trespass and the underground are frequent themes. Whilst recording for the 2016 BBC World Service radio show \\"The Forum\\" with Bridget Kendall, Garrett stated \\"if the 20th century was the age of the skyscraper then the 21st century is probably the age of the tunnel.\\" In 2017, Garrett began a three-year research fellowship at the University of Sydney, which involved embedding himself with doomsday prepper communities around the world who were preparing for a global disaster. The resulting book, published in 2020, in first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, was completed with eerie timeliness, according to writer Robert Macfarlane. The book received positive reviews from US and UK media outlets. In July 2020, as part of the launch of Bunker: Building for the End Times, Garrett was a guest on the The Joe Rogan Experience hosted by Joe Rogan. In the interview, Garrett revealed that he had purchased a forest cabin in Big Bear Lake, California, where he'd begun to stockpile supplies for widespread social, political, or environmental breakdown.

Controversy  Garrett has been criticised for being too close to his project participants and failing to maintain objective distance as a researcher. In 2011, four of his project participants were arrested inside the London Tube on Easter. Garrett himself was later also arrested at Heathrow Airport by British Transport Police investigating the group's means of access to abandoned Tube stations. Garrett maintains that he does ethnography in the tradition of the Chicago school (sociology) and claims the only way to understand a culture is to become fully immersed in it. The charges against Garrett concluded with a three-year conditional discharge and a £2000 fine being issued by the court. Will Self came to the defence of Garrett and the urban explorers, writing in the London Evening Standard that \\"place-hackers are performing a valuable service by reminding us that the city should, in principle, belong to its citizens\\" University of Oxford Halford Mackinder Professor of Geography Professor Danny Dorling also spoke out at the end of the case, contending that the prosecution had been a fundamental breach of academic liberty. In an interview with the Guardian in 2016, Garrett said \\"I realise that the trauma we were subjected to was actually the point. What the British Transport police wanted to do was stop me from publishing photos [of the sites visited] and stop me from writing about this thing, because what we did undermined their narrative of security.” A 2018 European Ethics Framework published by PRO-RES suggested that Garrett's research was ethically problematic because, \\"Garrett adopts various professional and personal roles – sometimes he is an ethnographer, sometimes an urban explorer, sometimes a political activist, film-maker or gonzo journalist.\\"  Popular references  In the 2015 book of short stories Three Moments of an Explosion: Stories by China Miéville, the character Infiltrex is based on Garrett.Three Moments of an Explosion: Stories, Retrieved 13 June 2019 In the 2017 book The Last London by Iain Sinclair, Sinclair writes about how Garrett and friends in London had been busy constructing a network of illegal structures they called \\"urban bothies\\". Sinclair writes that \\"They are bivouacs, where people are free to rest, write, eat, sleep, disguised by black paint and a padlock. They look like any other workman's hut, within the dead zones of some of the most secure and spooked enclaves in the City of London.\\" In the 2019 book Underland: A Deep Time Journey by Robert Macfarlane (writer), part of the chapter entitled \\"Invisible Cities\\" is based around Macfarlane's explorations with Garrett underground in London and Wales. Macfarlane also describes acting as a character witness in Garrett's trial with the London Consolidation Crew. He writes, \\"As well as a daredevil adventurer's streak, Bradley had an archaeologist's interest in contemporary forms of obsolescence, and a natural historian's interest in how the wild returned to abandoned places... I came to associate my time away with Bradley with adrenaline, alcohol, and extreme fatigue.\\"  References   External links  *Dr Bradley Garrett at University College Dublin *Bradley Garrett's website *Place Hacking Category:Living people Category:Social geographers Category:American academics Category:University of California, Riverside alumni Category:1981 births ","title":"Bradley Garrett"},{"id":"40219641","text":"Mohammad Alavi (, ) is an Iranian video game developer who currently works at Respawn Entertainment. He is best known for his critically acclaimed work on the Call of Duty series at Infinity Ward, creating the iconic \\"Crew Expendable\\" and \\"All Ghillied Up\\" missions from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (2007) as well as the controversial \\"No Russian\\" mission from Modern Warfare 2 (2009). Biography Mohammad Alavi was born in the 1980s in Tehran, Iran and relocated to the United States with his family after the Iran–Iraq War. He remains proud of his family's culture, and calls himself \\"An Iranian inside his heart\\". Alavi attended Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies in Richmond, Virginia. He then attended Virginia Tech, majoring in Biology and Chemistry before becoming a video game designer after being credited for creating some of the best modded games in PC Gamer magazine. He applied to and attended Full Sail University. He has two elder siblings, a brother and a sister, who are both physicians. Career Alavi's main field of expertise is design and cinematic gameplay scripting. His creations are described \\"thoughtful\\" and noted in terms of AI companion role. =Entering video game industry= During his college years, Alavi started to create mods for Duke Nukem 3D, Quake, Half-Life and Counter-Strike. His hobby was to work as a mapper and texture artist for mods. He later made a reputation for himself under the alias \\"BadMofo\\", when one of his works was published on an issue of PC Gamer. Alavi later entered Full Sail University to focus on programming, and applied for a programming job at Infinity Ward following his graduation. Considering his reputation as a modder, the company offered him a job as a level designer, instead of a programmer. =Call of Duty series= According to Edge, Alavi \\"is responsible for some of the most intense and memorable campaign levels in Call Of Duty history\\". PC Gamer called Alavi \\"the designer behind two of the most acclaimed missions in Call of Duty history (\\"All Ghillied Up\\" and \\"No Russian\\")\\". Alavi created his first professional levels for Call of Duty 2, including the potato-throwing grenade tutorial. The first level of Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, \\"Crew Expendable\\", which is set on a ship on a stormy sea is also his work. His design for the level was initially rejected by the leads, due to technical complexities, but Alavi stayed after hours and worked 18-hour days for three weeks to secretly script the rejected level. Once the leads became aware of his work and saw his not quite done work, they were convinced to include it in the game. The same went for a flashback mission called \\"All Ghillied Up\\", when he ended up writing the necessary code himself. His \\"tense and deliberately paced mission\\" was debuted in E3 2007. The mission marked the first time in the series that non-player characters were capable of stealth behaviours. The mission won significant critical attention, being described as \\"One Of Gaming's Best Levels\\" and \\"The Best Call Of Duty Mission Ever\\" in reviews. In 2011, Now Gamer ranked the level the 20th on its \\"Top 50 Gaming Moments\\". It was also ranked #13 in IGN's \\"Top 100 Video Game Moments\\". Alavi's script for AI in Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, ended up having value and formed the template next title of the series, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. \\"No Russian\\" controversy Alavi was the designer of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2s controversial mission called \\"No Russian\\". The mission was described \\"Call of Dutys most controversial moment\\" by PC Gamer and GamesRadar named it \\"one of the 10 most shocking game moments of the 2000s.\\" = Titanfall series = In 2010, Alavi co-founded Titanfall's team in Respawn Entertainment alongside other former Call of Duty developers. He served as the senior map designer for the studio, and shot some motion capture footage as an actor. According to PC Gamer, its difficult to know the details of Alavi's design and scripting in the game, however his influence is apparent in \\"how Titanfalls on-map AI allies support the player\\". In an interview, Alavi stated that he was heavily involved in different aspects of the project, including AI design, gameplay and level design. He also bore much responsibility for the game involving a narrative component at all, pushing for longer and different introductions to each campaign map. In order to convince that the feature can be achieved within budget, he designed an introduction for \\"Airbase\\" map in three days. Alavi resumed his work at Respawn Entertainment by working on Titanfall 2.

However, the England U19s lost the semifinal match to the Pakistan U19s in a tight contest. Rhodes nonetheless received praise for his captaincy in that match. Rhodes was born in Nottingham but grew up in the East Yorkshire village of Cottingham on the outskirts of Kingston upon Hull. In June 2017, it was announced that Rhodes would join Warwickshire ahead of the 2018 season.

Line 25, 3rd from bottom, repeats the long name. (high resolution, expandible photo) The cuneiform MEŠ, or meš is a plural form attached at the end of Mesopotamian cuneiform words as a suffix. As part of a name (PN, personal name, or other), or major class being referenced, in capital letters (a Sumerogram form), it is typically separated from other capital letter Sumerograms with a period. The name of the group can follow, in lower case letters, for example: (men-massu,Rainey, 1970. El Amarna Tablets, 359-379, Glossary:Vocabulary, pp. 55-87, massu, p. 71. Amarna letter EA 365), LÚ.MEŠ- ma-as-sà-meš, (and using a secondary suffix meš, not being typical). The MEŠ cuneiform is a vertical stroke, followed by three or four angled smaller wedge-strokes. The strokes can also be \\"not angled\\", but 45 degree wedges, smaller, or large. For example, Amarna letter EA 161, Aziru to Pharaoh, shows a series of six preparation items listed sequentially. The following wedges (on the meš or Sumerogram .MEŠ wedges, are large, and the scribe has a scribing base line, that follows the vertical stroke, a baseline on which the wedges are placed sequentially. EA 161 shows the baseline 'remainder', extending beyond the last 3rd, or 4th wedge. Another common plural in the Amarna letters is HIA, 100x24px100x24px, found in personal names (Abdi-Heba), and the plural. Usage, Amarna letters and Epic of Gilgamesh In the Epic of Gilgamesh, (Tablets I-XII) the meš sign is used as follows: as meš, 8 times, as MEŠ, 253 times.Parpola, 197l. The Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, Sign List, pp. 155-165, sign no. 532, p. 164. In the Amarna letters, the meš sign is often referencing people, or types of people, but another common usage is KUR.MEŠ, since \\"land\\", or regions are often being discussed by the 'governors' of the city-states (called the 'man' of the city, typically). Meš, as cuneiform \\"Me\\", + cuneiform \\"Eš\\" The meš sign can be considered to be 1.--me (cuneiform). .(the horizontal \\"baseline\\"), 2.--with 3 vertical wedges., (eš (cuneiform)). A specific deviation from the standard can be seen in EA 153 (EA 153, Metropolitan Museum ), where five uses of meš, are based on only 1-wedge, (or a ligatured 2-wedges); it looks approximately as follows for one wedge, They are used for armymeš, as ERIM.MEŠ (EA 153:8, 11), also \\"men\\", LÚ.MEŠ (EA 153:9), feet (EA 153:3), and ships (EA 153:10). Meš, 2-basic styles Two basic types of meš signs are either expressed as wedges laid horizontally, following the vertical stroke, or wedges expressed at an angle, at any level of angle, upward, but all of consistent size. As wedges inscribed on a horizontal baseline, the wedges are usually centered, following the large vertical stroke; the horizontal baseline is not always exactly at the midpoint of the vertical stroke. The following wedges are either full-size, (or sometimes oversized); the wedges are also sometimes any percentage less than a full 3/4-wedge, or 1/2-wedge. Angled wedges are often much smaller expressed wedges, from 1/2 to 1/3? size. For space considerations, the angled wedges can be extremely high-angled, towards vertical, thus saving \\"horizontal text space\\"; alternatively, the wedges could be spaced out, allowing for the consumption of more 'line-text-space'. One example Amarna letter is a combination of the two horizontal, and angled wedge expressions. EA 153 has the \\"meš\\" sign built upon the vertical stroke, then 1-horizontal, and 2-angled strokes, laid across it at approximately 45 degrees. (The horizontal can be \\"an 'unseen', or 'overwritten' base\\" for the angled wedges laid upon it. In EA 153 the base line \\"head\\" is used as the first wedge-(non-angled), following by the angled wedge-2 and wedge-3.) =Amarna letter types by letter= Horizontal, w/ 3-, 4-wedges *EA 15 *EA 19 *EA 23 *EA 28 *EA 31 *EA 35 *EA 161 *EA 205 *EA 252 *EA 282 *EA 287 *EA 288 *EA 289 *EA 290 *EA 325 *EA 367 *EA 369 Angled 3-, 4-wedges *EA 86 *EA 144 *EA 147 *EA 270 *EA 271 *EA 273 *EA 296 *EA 362 *EA 364 *EA 365 External links *Special type of \\"meš\\", Image of Amarna letter EA 153, Metropolitan Museum References *Moran, William L. 1987, 1992.

It is a country along the Marmara Sealine. The area, which was inhabited since the 8th century BC, was formerly known as Τρίγλεια, Trigleia or Βρύλλειον, Brylleion in Greek. When demand for the products of Southern Marmara from the ancient world increased, ports have been constructed in Kios (Gemlik), Kurşunlu, Apamea Myrlea(Mudanya), Siği (Kumyaka), and Trilye (Zeytinbağı) and the region boomed. The most important historical structure in Trilye (Triglia) is that of the Byzantine Haghioi Theodoroi Church, known today as the Fatih Mosque. Mudanya, a residential and commercial development in this township is under state protection as a historical site. Trisect has been an important religious center for Greek Orthodox Christians for a long time. Trilye is a first level protected area since 1980 because of the Byzantine and Ottoman architectural monuments and is considered as an open-air museum thanks to the historical buildings and houses. Osman Gazi’s Turkmens in Bursa and surroundings have started settling in this location from the beginning of the year 1303. Kaymak Oba, Mirza Oba and Çepni villages located at the back of Trilye are believed to have been established during this era. After Mudanya was conquered in 1321 Trilye’s ports and other ports in the region started being used. The land at the western parts of Bursa namely the area between current Minor Industry Area (Küçük Sanayi Bölgesi) and Uluabat Lake were very fertile. Grapes, cocoons and cereal crops were grown in this region. In addition the Tahtalı, Demirci and Doğancı regions had high quality wood used in the production of ships. There are signs proving a Genoese cargo boat has visited Trilye port in the 1330s. Churches and monasteries were constructed in Trigleia and its surroundings on the patronage of Byzantine Emperors. Only 2500 people currently live in the town due to the impact of the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey. Only the ruins of the Byzantines remain, the ruins of old Byzantine churches. Greek houses built at the end of the 19th century prior to the Genocide line the remaining streets. Nevertheless, the town is under the protection of the Ministry of Culture so no one can destroy the old houses or rebuild them in a different style than the original one. The place is known for its olives and had historically been inhabited by Greek artisans engaged in the silk trade. 'Zeytingbagi' means 'olive yard'. History The area has been host to various civilizations since antiquity. Tirilye is the original village. Although the name of the village has been officially changed to Zeytinbağı (Olive Orchard), that name is rarely, if ever, used in daily life, and the name Trilye is used instead. There are several legends about the origins of the name. One is that the area was famous for red mullet and red gurnard and that those fish were the main course of the Byzantine emperors' tables. \\"Trigleia\\" (Triglia lucerna) is a word in Greek for such fish. Another legend comes from the Genoese. Three inhabitants of the village were distressed by the looting of pirates. Therefore, they combined their power and decided to live together. The name Tirilye is said to be derived from those three villagers. Even after the Ottoman Empire absorbed the area, it remained Greek-populated. Although some Muslims from several areas in Anatolia had settled here the Christian population remained in the majority. During the Greek genocide, the wealthier class of the inhabitants of the village opened their shops and started distributing oil, rice, sugar, etc., to the poor, but were prevented from continuing further distribution by the Government officials. One Church was turned into a Mosque. Houses were demolished. After the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922 and the population exchange between Greece and Turkey that followed the Greeks left the village. The Greeks migrated to Greece with the help of local businessman and ship owner Phillipos Kavounidis. The refugees were taken mainly to two places 1) to Rafina, near Athens, where icons from the churches can currently be seen inside one of the local churches and 2) to Nea Triglia, Chalkidiki. In turn, Muslim immigrants mainly from Salonica (Thessaloniki and Langadas) and other places were settled in Tirilye. Fatih Mosque Fatih Mosque The Fatih Mosque (Turkish: Fatih Camii) is a mosque in Tirilye, which was converted from an 8th-century Byzantine church dedicated to Saint Stefanos (Moni Hinolakou- Μονή Χηνολάκκου). The building was constructed between 720 and 730 AD, originally as the Church of Christ and Saint Stefanos. After the Ottoman conquest of the town, it was converted (in 1661) to a mosque and named \\"Fatih\\", which means \\"conqueror\\". The mosque was briefly rededicated as a church during the Greek orccupation of the area in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922. The church is the oldest Byzantine building in the region, and has protected status. It is of the typical Byzantine cross-in-square style and has Byzantine column headings at the entrance and a dome high. The mosque is entuered thorough a portico covered with a wooden roof which is standing on four columns that have ornamented metal headings. The building has a mihrab that is covered with a half-dome. It has been declared as a protected monument by 1299/31.8.1990 decision of BURSA KÜLTÜR ve TABİAT VARLIKLARINI KORUMA KURULU BÜRO MÜDÜRLÜĞÜ. New Stone School (Taş Mektep) Taş Mektep The New Stone School, built on an idea of Metropolitan Chryssostomos, in a markedly neoclassical style, is the largest building in town. The construction of the magnificent building started in 1909 and was completed in three years (1912). It is situated on an area of , is four stories high and is located on the hill at the west of İskele Street. In 1924 after the establishment of the republic it is opened as a school called Dar-ül Eytam for orphans, who were the children of soldiers that died in the war. The building served as a boarding school, a primary school and a secondary school later on. The historical building that was evacuated in 1989 was transferred to Uludağ University first and then was transferred to Zeytinbağı Municipality for restorations. It has been declared as a protected monument by 1299/31.8.1990 decision of BURSA KÜLTÜR ve TABİAT VARLIKLARINI KORUMA KURULU BÜRO MÜDÜRLÜĞÜ.  Yperagia Theotokos-Metropolis Church  The complex, which was constructed in Trilye in 1878 as a Greek Church, after 1924 The Dar-ül Eytam School, which opens to the Stone School (being used for the workshops for carpentry and iron works for 400 students), and the “Dündar House\\", used as a mess house. The church had three vertical lines similar to all other churches(Vertical lines are separated with columns), but the abscissa of the church was demolished for creating a new entrance, causing the upper part of the entrance to be higher than the sides. The Church building was used as a mess hall until the school was closed in September 1927. Due to its function it was called “mess hall” until its restoration, which turned the building into Faruk Çelik Cultural Center. It has been declared as a protected monument by 1299/31.8.1990 decision of BURSA KÜLTÜR ve TABİAT VARLIKLARINI KORUMA KURULU BÜRO MÜDÜRLÜĞÜ. Upon the request of the Greek Culture Delegation a ceremony was held in this building during the visit of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Bartholomew I to Tirilye on July 1, 2009. Starting from 2019 \\"Theofaneia\\" ceremony is held each year (on 19/1/2019 and 20/1/2020) by Patriarch Bartholomew.  Churches in the city In Triyle there were seven churches, three monasteries and three holy springs in Zeytinbağı however only four of these churches have survived up until now and are Ayios Stefanos or Moni Hinolakou (Fatih Camii since 1661), Panagia Pantovasilissa (Kemer Kilise), Ayios Georgios Ano (known as Dundar's House) and Virgin Mary-Metropolis. All four have been declared as a protected monuments by 1299/31.8.1990 decision of BURSA KÜLTÜR ve TABİAT VARLIKLARINI KORUMA KURULU BÜRO MÜDÜRLÜĞÜ. Of the monasteries, only Ayios Ioannis Theologos (Pelekete) Monastery has even partially survived among the three monasteries and the area around it has been declared as archeological area by 3996/27.9.2013 decision of the same Bureau. On one of the demolished churches (Ayios Yoannis) has been built the Trilye Town Hall. The ruins of the three monasteries, which were built during the Byzantine era, are out of Trilye. One of these is the Medikion Monastery (Hagios Sergios Monastery) located on the road to Eşkel Village. The monastery was built during the 8th century and is now operated as a farm. Today, all that remains are the perimeter walls, and the magnificent entrance doors, being. The monastery has been declared as a protected monument by 1299/31.8.1990 decision of the same Bureau.The ruin of the second monastery is far from the town and is called Hagios Ioannis Theologos (Pelekete) Aya Yani Monastery, which is known as the Ayani Ranch by the public. The monastery was built in 709 and used until 1922; only some ruins of the church and walls are remaining today. As said, the area around the monastery has been declared as archeological area by 3996/27.9.2013 decision of the same Bureau. The third ruin is the one of the Vatheos Rhyakos Soterios Monastery known as the Aya Sotiri by the public. Most of the buildings of the monastery are ruined. However, their owners still use some buildings as shelters. Turks, who settled in the area during Yavuz Sultan Selim Time, also built a Turkish bath and a School in 1907. Those structures are regarded as important historical locations, which have also survived into modern day. Panagia Pantobasilissa (Lady Queen of All) Church Panagia Pantobasilissa or Arched Church as it is called in the region is known to be the first church where the walls were decorated with frescoes. It is indicated in some handwritten scripts that the church was dedicated to Panagia Pantobasillissa (Mary Queen of All). The church is based on a Greek cross plan to in the east and west directions. Although the building is not used currently it has still survived. According to the construction style of its walls, it is believed that the building was constructed at the end of the 13th century. The church has pictures on its walls at different layers and is considered to be very important for Christians. The first layer of frescos were made at the start of the 14th century, the second layer of frescos were made in 1723. It is believed that the columns were brought from Alexandria. There are support pillars at the façades and the public calls the building as the Arched Church. It has been declared as a protected monument by 1299/31.8.1990 decision of BURSA KÜLTÜR ve TABİAT VARLIKLARINI KORUMA KURULU BÜRO MÜDÜRLÜĞÜ. Dündar House The Agios Georgios Ano Greek Church, which is known as the Dündar House in the region, has been transferred to private property after Greeks abandoned the region. It is located in the north of Taş Mektep (New School built by Metropolitan Chryssostomos 1909-1912). It was reconstructed at the end of the 19th century and has a basilical plan type. The wooden main entrance door in the middle of the western wall has two wings. The door opening is framed by a round arch that sits on the marble pilasters, as well as a rectangular frame consisting of a pilaster on the sides and a two-step lintel at the top. Three-floored western part of the church was used as a residence but currently is closed. There are two windows on each side of the two rows of windows that illuminate the narthex on the sides of this door. The lower row windows are rectangular near the square, the upper row is narrower and longer. There are Byzantine decorations and stone ornaments on its walls. Monastery of Hagios Sergios It is located at the beginning of the road that leaves the main road in the south of Tirilye and leads to the land with olive groves. The monastery was established in the late 8th century, and produced some important iconodule figures during the Byzantine Iconoclasm. After that, its history is obscure; it is mentioned in 1054, and it is known that it burned down and was rebuilt in 1800–01, but had fallen into disuse by the end of the 19th century, Today, only the outer wall of the complex survives. Pelekete monastery The ruin of the monastery is far from the town and is called Hagios Ioannes Theologos (Pelekete) Aya Yani Monastery, which is known as the Ayani Ranch by the public. The monastery was built in 709 and used until 1922; only the ruins of the church and walls are remaining today. Batheos Rhyakos Soteros Monastery The ruins of the monastery belong to Batheos Rhyakos Soteros Monastery known as the Aya Sotiri by the public. Most of the buildings of the monastery are ruined however their owners use some buildings as shelters. Christ-Sauveur / Ruissau-Profond Monastery It was built in 956.http://www.yesilbursadergisi.com/mobil/haber.php?id=321 Kapanca Port The antic port, which is in Kapanca Districts of Trilye, dates back to the Roman era; it was the most important port for transportation during its time. It has been understood that the Genoese have used Trilye and Apemeia (Mudanya) ports for transporting the salt extracted from the northern part of the Appolonia Lake. Trilye was an important port for exporting the goods produced in the fertile lands to the center of the Byzantine Empire. Swallow's Nest (Historical Pine Teahouse) (Tarihi Çamlı Kahve) The Historical Pine Coffee lies on a high hill past the Stone School and is referred as the balcony of Trilye. This area is used as a teahouse and overlooks the sea and olive orchards. Turkish bath The exact name and construction date is not known of hamam (Turkish Bath) which is located at the same building lot with the Fatih Mosque and in the southern side of it; however, there is information to the effect that it was built by Turks brought from Kastamonu and Üsküdar during Yavuz Sultan Selim's era in the first half of the 16th century. The building features a rectangular plan schema consisting of five spaces. Its walls were laid with rough stone and brick; in the laying system, typical lighting gaps peculiar to baths were allowed. The space above the göbek taşı (heated marble platform on which one lies to sweat in a Turkish bath) is covered with two small domes. Other spaces are covered with broken-roof. Despite its quite well preserved condition in physical terms, it is not being used today.

The church in its entirety dates from the 13th century, with the last additions probably being made c. 1300. A few alterations are of later date. It contains several medieval furnishings, as well as some medieval stained glass windows. Alskog Church belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies in the Diocese of Visby.  History and architecture  The oldest part of the church is the nave, dating from the first quarter of the 13th century. It displays an unusual southern portal, decorated with sculptures. Inside, the nave is divided in two parts by two central columns and has a vaulted ceiling. The tower is somewhat later but also from the early 13th century. Its portal show similarities with the tower portal of Visby Cathedral. The much larger choir and vestry were added circa 1300. The ambition was probably to rebuild the whole church into a larger, Gothic church, but for some reason only the eastern part of the church was rebuilt. Few alterations have been made since the Middle Ages. During the 19th century, some windows were added and new pews installed. The church underwent a renovation in 1964–1965 following a proposal by architect Karl Erik Hjalmarson. Of the furnishings, the triumphal cross, dating from circa 1200 is perhaps the most noteworthy, together with the richly carved baptismal font, complete with substantial traces of original colour, from the same time. A few separate medieval sculptures also survive, originally part of a 14th-century retable. The church windows have several preserved stained glass panes from around 1300, probably when the choir was built. They depict scenes from the life of Jesus. From the time after the Reformation, the pulpit deserves mention. It was made in 1586 and is the oldest pulpit on Gotland. The church also has a pair of embroidered bags for collection of alms made in Istanbul in 1775. They were brought to the church by the priest at the Swedish legation in the city, who was the son of a pastor in Alskog Church. The church belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies within the Diocese of Visby.

Several mechanisms are considered epigenetic, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs. Epigenetic mechanisms play a role in processes like development, learning and memory formation, aging, diseases, cell differentiation and genome defence. DNA methylation DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism. It is a chemical modification of the DNA where a methyl group is attached to cytosine. This modification is set by DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts). There are three known types of DNA methyltransferases in mammals. Those DNA methyltransferases are present in insects as well, although it varies between different species which specific Dnmt types are present. It still is a matter of discussion what the specific role of DNA methylation in insects is, as some insects such as Drosophila melanogaster just have traces of DNA methylation in their genome and in general insect genomes are much less methylated compared to mammalian genomes (0.034% vs. 7.6% in Mus musculus). In a comparison of different insect species and their respective methylation levels, there was a clear relationship between cell turn over and DNA methylation, but not between genome size or the number of repetitive sequences and DNA methylation. =In honeybees= Honeybees (Apis mellifera) marked after hatching with colour Honeybees (Apis mellifera) possess homologs for all three DNA methyltransferases known in mammals.Wang, Y., et al., Functional CpG methylation system in a social insect. Science, 2006. 314(5799): p. 645-7.Matsui, T., et al., Expression profiles of urbilaterian genes uniquely shared between honey bee and vertebrates. BMC Genomics, 2009. 10(1): p. 17. But unlike mammals they possess two DNA methyltransferases 1 and just one DNA methyltransferase 3. DNA methylation predominantly occurs in coding regions in honeybees.Lyko, F., et al., The honey bee epigenomes: differential methylation of brain DNA in queens and workers. PLoS Biol, 2010. 8(11): p. e1000506. The function of the DNA methylation in honey bees is to regulate gene alternative splicing Development DNA methylation plays a major role in honeybee caste and subcaste development. In honeybees there are two different castes which are workers and queens. They are genetically the same, but show morphological, physiological and behavioral differences. Among the worker caste there are two subcastes, which are nurses and foragers. Which subcaste a worker bee belongs to depends on its age. The DNA methylation pattern in queens and workers,Shi, Y., et al., Genomewide analysis indicates that queen larvae have lower methylation levels in the honey bee (Apis mellifera). Naturwissenschaften, 2013. 100(2): p. 193-197.Shi, Y.Y., et al., Diet and cell size both affect queen-worker differentiation through DNA methylation in honey bees (Apis mellifera, Apidae). PLoS One, 2011. 6(4): p. e18808. and between nurses and foragers is different.Herb, B.R., et al., Reversible switching between epigenetic states in honeybee behavioral subcastes. Nat Neurosci, 2012. 15(10): p. 1371-3.Lockett, G.A., R. Kucharski, and R. Maleszka, DNA methylation changes elicited by social stimuli in the brains of worker honey bees. Genes Brain Behav, 2012. 11(2): p. 235-42. DNA methylation also increases in worker larvae with age, especially in coding regions and CpG islands. If DNA methyltransferase 3 is silenced in honeybee larvae they develop into queens, whereas they otherwise would develop into workers.Kucharski, R., et al., Nutritional control of reproductive status in honeybees via DNA methylation. Science, 2008. 319(5871): p. 1827-30. Associative learning Using the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor zebularine, the role of DNA methyltransferases during learning and memory formation has been studied. If DNA methyltransferases are inhibited during an associative learning paradigm, in which the bee is trained to associate an odour with a food reward, the odour specific associative long-term memory of bees is impaired,Biergans, S.D., et al., DNA methylation mediates the discriminatory power of associative long-term memory in honeybees. PLoS One, 2012. 7(6): p. e39349. as well as their extinction memory.Lockett, G.A., P. Helliwell, and R. Maleszka, Involvement of DNA methylation in memory processing in the honey bee. NeuroReport, 2010. 21(12): p. 812-6. Short-term memory formation and acquisition are not affected by DNA methyltransferase inhibition. =In fruitflies= The fruitfly D. melanogaster possess just one DNA methyltransferase, which is Dnmt 2-like. Dnmt 2 is not known to methylate DNA in mammals. In Drosophila however a knock down of Dnmt 2-like protein is sufficient to deplete DNA methylation completely and an overexpression of Dnmt 2 causes hypermethylation of the DNA.Kunert, N. et al. A Dnmt2-like protein mediates DNA methylation in Drosophila Development 2003 130:5083-5090; posted ahead of print August 27, 2003, However, lines deficient for Dnmt 2 retain genomic methylation, implying the presence of a novel methyltransferase.

Life Sophie von Scherer, née Sockl, was born in Vienna, the daughter of the master cabinet-maker and inventor, Johann Gottlieb Sockl and Sophie, née Shurer von Waldheim. Among her siblings was the painter and photographer Theodor Sockl. In her youth she was a painter, but later turned to writing. Sophie married Anton Ritter von Scherer in 1841 and was the mother of the well-known Graz and Vienna religious law professor Rudolf Ritter von Scherer (1845-1918).Kronthaler, Michaela: Prägende Frauen der steirischen Kirchengeschichte. – In: Kirche und Christentum in der Steiermark, Bd. 5. – Kehl am Rhein, Echo-Buchverlag, 2000, p. 30–31 In 1848, she published her 3 volumes educational work, a novelty in the form of an epistolary novel. On the one hand, there was practical parenting advice for women of the middle and upper classes, and on the other hand Sophie wrote about the specific obligations of women, defined primarily as wives and mothers. Even though she was against the Revolution of 1848, she supported social reforms, such as financial and social improvements in the status of the domestic servants, old- age insurance, kindergartens, measures of child care and child support for socially vulnerable families.B. Zaar: Scherer, Sophie von; geb. Sockl. In: Österreichisches Biographisches Lexikon 1815–1950 (ÖBL). Volume 10. Published by the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna 1994, , p. 88. In the autumn of the year 1848, in the context of the recently granted freedom of the press, in an open letter dated 17 November 1848, she made an appeal \\"in the interest of the Catholic faith\\" at the first German bishops' conference in Würzburg. As a devout Catholic loyal to Rome, she opposed this emerging group of German Catholics and presented her ecclesiastical reform considerations, such as the worship simplification by omitting litanies and prayers not directly related to the Catholic faith, the introduction of the vernacular German in worship or the abolition of celibacy in order to overcome the gap between the priests and laity. While the church ignored it, the letter triggered a family dispute. Her brother, the Catholic Viennese painter Theodor Sockl, attacked her in a subsequent open letter, accusing her of Protestant convictions. In her turn, she invalidated her brother's arguments in a public reply (this would be her last publication).

Four people were killed.  Damage and casualties  The earthquake registered a magnitude of 6.8 on the moment magnitude scale. Between the main shock and an aftershock that followed three days later, 540 houses were destroyed on Samos, then an autonomous part of the Ottoman Empire. Four people were killed. Damage extended to Patmos and Anatolia, while shaking from the earthquake reached from offshore Chios and Santorini to Ödemiş and Aydın in Turkey.  Geology  Along its source fault, the earthquake created of ruptured rock and had an average displacement of . It originated from oblique-slip faulting. The island of Samos disconnected from Anatolia, and the strait between them is less than in width. The island itself is a horst, and a large fault runs along the island's NW-W coast. Tectonic uplift is noticeable at the shores of Samos, likely linked to historic earthquakes.  Seismic history  Within the last two centuries, Samos has experienced multiple powerful earthquakes registering above magnitude 6.0. Six such earthquakes were recorded during the 19th century and two more in the 20th. Analysis indicates three earthquakes before the 19th century in circa 200 BC, 47, and 1761.

It is used in combination with vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, to treat melanoma. In November 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved cobimetinib for unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation, in combination with vemurafenib (Zelboraf). Cobimetinib is not indicated for treatment of patients with wild- type BRAF melanoma.  Medical use  Cobimetinib is approved for use in combination with vemurafenib (Zelboraf) for the treatment of advanced melanoma with BRAF mutation (either V600E or V600K) that cannot be removed by surgery or which has metastasized.  Adverse effects  Common adverse effects observed in cobimetinib and vemurafenib co-treated persons in clinical trials included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, rash, photosensitivity, and pyrexia.  History  Cobimetinib was awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for malignant melanoma with BRAFV600 mutation in 2014. Acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib, commonly occurs after several months of progression-free tumor response. Preclinical data indicated the involvement of MAPK pathways and MAPK-independent signaling in the developed resistance, suggesting dual inhibition of MEK and BRAF kinase as a strategy for increasing the longevity of tumor response seen with BRAF inhibition alone. In phase III clinical trials, the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib was tested in patients with BRAFV600-mutated metastatic melanoma, which resulted in significant improvement in progression-free survival in patients, but also produced some increase in toxicity. The combination increased progression-free survival to an average of 12.3 months, compared to 7.2 months for vemurafenib alone. This clinical data also showed that the combination treatment resulted in 65% survival rate of patients 17 months after beginning the treatment, increased rates from the 50% of patients on vemurafenib treatment alone. Adding cobimetinib also increased the median overall survival to 25.6 months, compared to the 18 months for vemurafenib alone. Pre-clinical investigation suggests that combined use of Cobimetinib with PI3K inhibition could boost the anti-cancer effects of the drug, with a synergistic response being observed in lung cancer cell lines.

He was a general of the Constitutionalist Army under the orders of Venustiano Carranza. Alvarado was the Governor of Yucatán from February 1915 (in Spanish) to November, 1918.Buchenau (2009), p 54Joseph (1988), p 115 There is a Salvador Alvarado Municipality in the State of Sinaloa, where he was born, named in his honor. Early life and personal life Salvador Alvarado was born on September 16, 1880, in Culiacán, in the Mexican state of Sinaloa to Timoteo Alvarado and Antonia Rubio. (in Spanish) His family moved to a yaqui pueblo, known as Pótam, in Sonora when Alvarado was around eight years old. As a young man, he moved to the port of Guaymas and worked in the pharmacy of Don Luis G. Dávila. He later moved to Cananea, where he opened his own pharmacy and worked for several years as a pharmacist and merchant. (in Spanish) In 1906, he joined the Partido Liberal Mexicano (Mexican Liberal Party) whose members were against the re-election of President Porfirio Díaz and began participating in clandestine activities for Díaz's opponent Ricardo Flores Magón. In 1910 Alvarado joined the Anti-Reelectionist Party in Sonora, which had been established by, Benjamín G. Hill. Later that same year, he and other young idealists with revolutionary fervor attacked a military barracks in Hermosillo, Sonora. Their failed assault resulted in some of the rebels being executed and others, like Salvador Alvarado, escaped into Arizona. Alvarado was a widower when he came to Yucatán. After a lengthy courtship, he married Laura Manzano, a local young woman of modest means. Military career In 1911, when Francisco I. Madero who had also been exiled into Texas, wrote the Plan de San Luis Potosí calling for the election to be declared null and void, and for Díaz to be overthrown, Alvarado recrossed the border into Mexico. He joined the revolutionary army as a captain, fighting Porfirio Díaz, under the command of Juan G. Carvajal. In February 1911, Madero and his forces attacked the city of Casas Grandes, Chihuahua and defeated Díaz's troops. A short time later, two of Madero's generals, Pascual Orozco and Pancho Villa against Madero's orders, attacked and defeated Díaz's federales at Ciudad Juárez, just across the border from El Paso, Texas. These victories led, in May 1911, to Porfírio Díaz's resignation and exile. A peace treaty was signed, Madero and his troops marched into Mexico City, elections were held and in November, 1911, Francisco Madero became Mexico's new President. Northern Mexico at this time was in open rebellion. In Sonora the Yaqui were waging guerrilla warfare, Morelos and Durango were also unstable, and Pascual Orozco, former Madero supporter, was attempting to usurp the authority of Chihuahua governor Abraham González. The conflicts kept Alvarado busy and he steadily climbed the military ranks from Major to Lieutenant Colonel to Colonel and finally General. In November 1911, Emiliano Zapata, angered at Madero's failure to implement land reform, wrote the Plan of Ayala, declaring Madero to be a traitor, created a land reform plan, and declared Madero's former general Orozco head of their revolt. Madero sent General Victoriano Huerta in 1912, to quash their revolt and he quickly defeated Orozco and sent him into exile. Alvarado fought alongside Huerta against Orozco and was promoted to the Chief of the Federal Auxiliary. Madero was attempting to balance between the Right (who wanted to retain their rights and privileges) and the Left (who wanted reform, and particularly land reform).McLynn (2001), p 147 With the events known as \\"La Decena Trágica\\" (Ten Tragic Days), which occurred from 9 to 19 February 1913, Mexico City was under siege and bombardment, Huerta gained control of the military, staged a coup d'état, had Madero, his vice president and most loyal officers killed and declared himself president. Within days of the murder of Madero and Gonzalez, Venustiano Carranza took over as the revolutionary leader, calling himself \\"First Chief of the Constitutionalist Forces\\". Alvarado did not recognize the presidency of Huerta and immediately joined the constitutionalist revolution led by Carranza, who promoted him to Brigadier General, Commander of the Parade Ground of Mexico City, and Commander of the Army of the Southeast. By June 1914, José María Maytorena, Maderista Governor of Sonora, whose government was being undermined by Alvarado, Calles, Obregon and Carranza, gave his support to Villa in the struggle against Carranza. Maytorena's Yaqui generals Francisco Urbalejo and Jose Maria Acosta then stated they would shoot Alvarado if he led an attempt to remove Maytorena from office or command of his forces. In July, Alvarado was sent to the port of Guaymas, was captured and imprisoned in July by Maytorena, but was able to escape in late September. He made his way to join Carranza in the center of Mexico and was ordered to proceed to Puebla to organize the Constitutionalist troops of Puebla and Tlaxcala. On 8 July 1914, Huerta resigned his presidency and was succeeded by Francisco S. Carvajal, who also resigned, just over a month later on 12 August 1914.National Heritage Academies, pp 30-31 With the triumph of the constitutionalists, Carranza dispatched many of his officers to bring order and establish governments in various states. On 27 February 1915, Carranza named Alvarado Governor and military commander of Yucatán. His forces had little difficulty in putting down the rebel movement and by 19 March 1915, Alvarado had arrived in the capital of Mérida. (in Spanish) Governorship Alvarado took six months after arriving in Mérida to evaluate the conditions he found, gathering data from all social levels assisted by local Yucatecos. He staffed his bureaucracy with a mix of \\"conservative planters and radical intellectuals\\" and forged a coalition to restructure society. One of his first actions was to address the situation of the Maya peasants and liberate them from serfdom, prohibiting their confinement, forced guardianships, retention of their children, and whipping as well as other corporal punishment. He canceled their indenture debts with the landowners and established laws for women and child laborers, including domestic workers, defining maximum hours, minimum pay, mandatory rest periods, health and safety standards, and prohibitions on immoral employment. His vision was to change the almost feudal Hacienda system into a capitalist system converting the peones into true proletarian workers who were paid wages and in turn would increase production for the Henequin plantation owners.Joseph (1988), p 102 Alvarado established \\"Tribunals of the Revolution\\" in each of the 16 partidos (districts) of the state to ensure that courts were accessible to everyone. Lawyers were prohibited, only the commander and secretary of the military court were allowed to participate, so that judgments were quickly obtained and unintimidating to the ignorant or poor. The military commanders resolved more than 3,600 cases ranging from reparations of robbery to abandonment to payments for rape or loss of honor. Alvarado also put an end to \\"Cohecho Investigations,\\" a misuse of the Sedition Law known as Circular Number One, which haciendados were using against workers to punish them for actions or words that might cause other workers to question working conditions. Without exception, prior to Alvarado, those accused were sentenced to jail. Though prosecutions stopped under Alvarado, he did not give retroactive justice in the case of cohecho violations, as he did in cases of beatings or nonpayment of wages. Mural by Fernando Castro Pacheco: Salvador Alvarado, Governor of Yucatán 1915-1918, at the Palacio de Gobierno, Mérida, Mexico Alvarado claimed that he had passed over 1,000 decrees during his three-year tenure as governor.Joseph (1988), p 103 One of his first acts reformed what was known as the \\"Five Sisters\\" - labor, land, property title registration, state treasury and municipal governance. In addition to freeing the Maya from debt servitude, he created Agrarian Committees in each municipality to oversee land and farm worker issues. Alvarado also established the agente de propaganda, a proto-ombudsman position, who was responsible for reporting abuses against common people by the landed class and merchants or violations of law. These local \\"agents,\\" like Felipe Carrillo Puerto, a later Yucatán governor,Joseph (1988), p 108 spoke both Spanish and MayaBlouin (2005), p 309 and helped create a sense of local justice and access in even the most remote or smallest village. Having established controls for peasants and land owners, Alvarado turned to education reform. He passed laws making education mandatory, secular and free and required that it focus on literacy, reading, writing, arithmetic and civic responsibility. Alvarado established agricultural, fine arts, arts and crafts schools and founded the Escuela Libre de Derecho, a free academic institution for teaching law. In all, he created more than 1000 schools, some of them co-educational, 300 libraries, and drove the founding of a music conservatory. His labor reforms included minimum wages, maximum hours, minimum working standards, accident compensation, child regulations and the right to strike,Joseph (1988), p 110 as well as prohibiting employers from forcing their religious beliefs on workers. He passed laws both recognizing and legalizing unionization and established an umbrella organization Casa del Obrero Mundial (The House of the World Worker) to encourage union workers toward active political participation.Joseph (1988), pp 109-110 Alvarado had studied both European and United States feminist theory and socialism and passed a series of laws aimed at freeing women from their traditional servitude, as he had the Maya. The protections on labor were extended to cover domestic workers. Because he felt that vice was particularly hard on women and families, a series of acts outlawing bullfights, drinking, gambling, lotteries and raffles were passed.Joseph (1988), p 105 Alvarado's prohibition law was one of the most restrictive in Mexico and even made drunkenness sufficient grounds for divorce. He did not pass laws criminalizing prostitution, but instead required regular health inspections for prostitutes. Anti-vice legislation aimed to eliminate bordellos and pimps, and fined men who used prostitutes or passed on venereal disease. Because he believed that religious fanaticism and loyalty to the church, rather than the state, was harmful and hampered the development of a modern society, Alvarado closed churches, confiscating icons and relics, and removed priests from state offices. He also passed legislation to establish old age pensionsJoseph (1988), p 111 and a law which created an office of Public Works. Alvarado's broad range of legislation was accompanied by his encouragement of civic participation. He called on teachers to hold the First Congress on Educational Campaigns in the State. He also drove the first feminist Congress in Mexico, which was held in Mérida, Yucatán in 1916. When Alvarado was recalled for military duty in other parts of Mexico in 1918, he appointed Carlos Castro Morales to succeed him and Felipe Carrillo Puerto as head of the Partido Socialista de Yucatán, the Yucatecan Socialist Party. Return to Federal Service In 1917, Carranza appointed Alvarado Chief of Military Operations for Southeast Mexico, which required that Alvarado spend many months away from Mérida. In November 1918, Alvarado was permanently recalled by Carranza. After the passage of the Constitution of 1917, Carranza appeared to turn his back on revolutionary principles. Lands that had been seized and nationalized were being turned over to his generals to secure their loyalty and in the process, created what was perceived as a new landed gentry. Zapata and his rebels became the newest targets of Carranza's regime, causing devastation through warfare to the people of Morelos, who were already battling the 1918 flu pandemic. Zapata's 1919 assassination, the resignation of Álvaro Obregón as Minister of War, and the failure to recognize Salvador Alvarado's maxim \\"give them land, and you bind them to Mexico,\\" increasingly alienated Carranza's former allies. Dissolution of support created factionalism and one of the most powerful factions was Los Sonorenses (The Sonoran Men), which included Adolfo de la Huerta, Alvaro Obregón, Plutarco Elías Calles, Benjamín G. Hill, and Salvador Alvarado. Alvarado founded a newspaper in 1919, El Heraldo de México, which he used as a platform to discuss intellectual ideals. Some, including Obregón, felt that the paper was a stage for Alvarado to gain national exposure for a presidential bid, but the claim was denied by Alvarado. Obregón remained skeptical of the denial and tensions between the two slowly began escalating. (in Spanish) Alvarado's political activities also angered Carranza, who had him arrested. He was released in January, 1920 and exiled to the United States. Returning from exile, Alvarado and other of Los Sonorenses joined (in Spanish) Obregón's Plan of Agua Prieta in April, 1920. Following Carranza's assassination and Adolfo de la Huerta's election as the Interim President of Mexico on 1 June 1920, Alvarado was named Secretary of the Treasury. De la Huerta had inherited an almost bankrupt government, and Alvarado made numerous trips to New York City to secure funds through both loans and publicity of Yucatecan henequin. In 1921 de la Huerta handed over power from his interim government to Álvaro Obregón and Alvarado left the Treasury and began working as the Director of Free Ports and Secretary of the Advisory Board of Petroleum. In 1922, Alvarado was in Yucatán and U.S. newspapers were reporting that he was meeting with leaders who were in opposition to Obregón and his chosen successor, Plutarco Elías Calles. By 1923, open rebellion between de la Huerta and Obregón was declared with Alvarado supporting his childhood friend, de la Huerta. De la Huerta was driven into exile in Los Angeles, California on March 7, 1924. Though Alvarado tried to flee to Canada, the United States, and then Guatemala, he was relentlessly pursued by Obregón's men. A few months after de la Huerta's death, Alvarado was ambushed while fleeing from Obregón's force at El Hormiguero ranchero, between Tenosique, Tabasco and Palenque, Chiapas and was killed on 10 June 1924.

It was frequented by the highwayman Dick Turpin in the 18th century, and it is alleged that one of his confidence tricks inspired the pub's name. The pub originally opened as a coaching inn called the Winchelsea Arms, but became known as the Ram Jam Inn by the early 19th century. Turpin was a temporary lodger at the inn, and resided here when he first found notoriety. He showed his landlady, Mrs Spring, how to draw mild and bitter ale from a single barrel, stating \\"ram one thumb in here whilst I make a hole ... now jam your other thumb in this hole while I find the forgotten spile pegs.\\" Turpin subsequently disappeared without paying his bill, while Spring was trapped with two thumbs in the barrel. An alternative, similar, account is that an unnamed con-artist, not specifically named as Turpin, made the landlord fall for the trick so the trickster could try and seduce the landlady. A third tale is that by the 19th century \\"ram-jam\\" was a term that meant both eating to capacity and a place full of people. In 1878, Hugh Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale ran 100 miles from Knightsbridge Barracks to the inn in under 18 hours in order to win a bet. Soul singer Geno Washington named his backing band the Ram Jam Band after the pub, as it was a popular place for the band to stop en route to gigs. When reviewing the inn in 2000, The Telegraph's Paddy Burt described the meals as \\"simple food, well done\\". The novelist Margaret Drabble enjoyed staying at the inn, noting that the double glazing effectively masks the sound of traffic on the A1. In August 2013 the pub was closed and put on the market for an estimated value of £550,000.

His company, Tibor Ltd., made its name by providing cutting-edge designs that were popular with both the public and featured in key post-war projects including The Festival of Britain, Concorde, Royal Yacht Britannia, Coventry Cathedral, Clarence House and the QE2. Reich was awarded a Design Council Award in 1957 and a Textile Institute Medal in 1973.  Early Life/University  Born in Budapest in 1916, Tibor Reich was from a family of wealthy Jewish textile industrialists. Encouraged by his father, he drew prodigiously from a young age. In 1933 he left Budapest to study textile design and architecture in Vienna, where he was influenced by the legacy of the Wiener Werkstätte and the Bauhaus. With the rise of Nazism in 1937 Reich emigrated to Britain to study textiles at Leeds University. Then the world's leading centre for textile technology, science and woven design Reich achieved a first-class result in the City and Guilds Institute examination in Woolen and Worsted Weaving. It was here that he learnt to experiment and was awarded a Diploma in Textile Industries in September 1941, following the submission of a thesis entitled ‘The Economical Production of Novelty Fabrics’. After graduating from Leeds, Reich went to work for Tootals of Bolton, but left after a year.  Tibor Ltd  In 1946 Reich moved to Stratford upon Avon and set up Tibor Ltd in a nineteenth- century mill at Clifford Chambers. From his studio he established a small weaving unit, where he set to work designing and manufacturing speciality fabrics. His early weaves were snapped up for dress couture including by the prestigious Edward Molyneux, who used them for their 1946 United States export collection because of their originality and colouration. In the same year 1947, he submitted one of his first hand woven furnishing fabric designs for selection by H.R.H. Princess Elizabeth, now H.M Queen Elizabeth. It was chosen as a wedding gift presented by the International Wool Secretariat. In the space of two years Reich was already employing over 50 staff and by 1948 had won a $100,000 order from Hambro House of Design in New York. By 1951 he was awarded a Certificate of Merit by the American Institute of Decorators.  Deep Textured Weaves  Up until the early 1950s British textiles, in particular furnishing fabrics, showed little consideration to colour, texture and modern pattern, with most relying on traditional motifs, and woven in a simple process. Inspired by the Bauhaus and his pre-war training, Reich's Deep Textures were woven in such a way as to give a third dimension to the surface pattern. This new technique brought a ‘pattern out of texture’ and opened up the possibility of exploring and freeing colour from two dimensional surfaces. Michael Farr stated in 1954 that Reich had started a ‘new phase in the development of British modern design for woven textiles.’ As Sir Terrance Conran stated in 1957 “Tibor Reich is internationally known for his woven and printed textiles. The texture and weave of the cloth to be printed on are especially considered in his designs’ Reich designed ‘Deep Textures’ for The Festival of Britain including The Southbank Festival Pavilions, Fairway Café, The Press Room, and The Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford upon Avon, where he draped and upholstered the entire building. Major furniture manufacturers upholstered using Tibor fabrics including Ernest Race, Gordon Russell, Robin Day, Howard Keith, G Plan and Ercol. In 1952 Reich had his first solo major show named ‘Deep Textures with Rayon’ at The Rayon Industry Design Centre designed by Hulme Chadwick RDI. In 1954 Liberty, in conjunction with The Council of Industrial Design, held a solo show of Reich's work named ‘Adventure with Colour’, opened by Sir Percy Thomas. It would later travel around the UK. Reich was commissioned to drape many of the key post-war projects of the 1950s. In 1954 Sir Hugh Casson and Sir Misha Black chose Tibor fabrics to drape The Royal Yacht Britannia and Time and Life Building. Other projects in the 1950s included London Airport (Heathrow), Arts Council UK, Berkeley and Washington Hotel, Renfrew Airport, Coventry Cathedral and the 1958 British Pavilion at the World's Fair, Brussels. In 1953 ICI commissioned Tibor to weave and design a tapestry for their coronation celebrations (also shown at the 10th Milan Triennial) and in 1958 Sanderson commissioned five tapestries to celebrate their 100th anniversary. Tibor fabrics were also commissioned by BOAC, Conair, Hawker Siddeley planes and Cunard ships including , , and . He also acted as a designer for Quayle and Tranter, Wilton, Denby, Stockwell, and Bigelow and Sanford, USA. Tibor also collaborated with Courtaulds on seating fabrics for Vauxhall motor cars.  1960s  One of the commercial highlights for Tibor Ltd in the 1960s was a commission to design the first sets of upholstery and curtain fabrics for the Anglo-French Concorde. Five Jacquard upholstery cloths in natural and gold were used as curtaining fabrics along with two carpet designs. During the 1960s Tibor fabrics were also on the QE2 and in embassies, Royal Palaces, hotels, Nos. 10 and 11 Downing Street, Board of Trade Building, Windsor Castle, Shakespeare Centre and for The Hotel Piccadilly in Manchester over six miles of fabric was produced by Tibor. During the 1960s Reich was commissioned to create works for major British institutions. These often took the form of richly coloured glowing tapestries and included designs for Coventry Cathedral, Manchester University, a 100-metre tapestry for The Board of Trade Westminster and the Academy Cinema. Tibor had showrooms in Old Burlington Street and Sloane Street and were stocked globally from the US to Japan. By the 1960s Tibor Ltd was employing over 60 design staff and was the largest privately owned Textile Design studio in the UK. Tibor fabrics were produced in over eight mills throughout the country including Gregs Quarry Bank Mill, who part owned Tibor Ltd.  Fotextur – Council of Industrial Design Award 1957  During the 1950s Reich, fed up with using a brush to imitate nature and feeling this method was repetitive set to work on experimenting with patterns deriving from photography. Whilst looking at a snapshot of his wife he noticed the light and shade patterns on a section of an old stone wall. In his dark room he set about distilling the pattern from the wall, henceforth starting the development of his new patented process ‘Fotextur.’ Through this process a pattern was produced by taking a photograph of a natural object or feature, making positive and negative prints from the photograph, and then re- arranging to make a design. In 1957 the Fotextur fabric ‘Flamingo’ was awarded a Council of Industrial Design award presented by Prince Philip in its inaugural year. Michael Farr wrote a seven-page article in Design calling it ‘revolutionary’ and observed that the Fotextur method although taking nature as its principal source, stepped beyond visual expressions that could be classified simply as floral or geometric. Indeed, he stated ‘Mr Reich has discovered a new way of seeing nature’ and in doing so created his own distinctive handwriting. Pathe news also featured a four-minute news reel on Fotextur. Fotextur was used on textiles, carpets, tiles, bags and pottery.  Colotomic – Design Centre 1960  Launched at The Design Centre, Haymarket ‘Colotomic’ was an evolution of the Fotextur process. It featured a print named ‘Atomic’ that derived pattern from one of the first photographs ever taken of an atom-splitting experiment. It was however also unique for its use of colour. In 1953 Reich had trademarked a pre-pantone idea of systematic colour charting called Collingo. ‘Atomic’ came in fourteen colourways each colourway contained four tones of a single colour. There were three principle colour groups and each tone within each group of colour both contrasted and worked together. The range was intended to allow the consumer to mix colourways in one setting. In a three-page article for Design magazine Stephen Garrett stated ‘By careful selection of the colourways, it should be possible to get the exact overall colour effect that is wanted.’  Shakespeare  Reich and Shakespeare crossed paths many times. His first brush was after moving to Stratford upon Avon and Clifford Mill in 1952 when he was chosen as part of Stratford's contribution to the Festival of Britain, to drape and upholster the new Shakespeare Memorial Theatre (RSC) He named the fabrics after Shakespearean characters: Cymbeline, Oberon, Macbeth, Prospero. In 1964, in celebration of Shakespeare's 400th Anniversary, Reich was commissioned by the Shakespeare Council to design and print a commemorative tapestry. His selection as the designer best suited to interpret the Shakespearean idiom in terms of modern fabrics also made him responsible for designing and weaving the fabrics and tapestries for the new Shakespeare Centre, which was opened by H.R.H. Duke of Edinburgh. His most famous tapestry was ‘Age of Kings’ and is now seen as an iconic 60s print and featured in the V&A; collection.  Pottery – Denby Tigo-Ware  Finding there was a noticeable lack of pottery which could co-ordinate with his Deep Textured fabric, in 1952 he designed his own studio pottery range called Tigo-Ware. Originally crafted from the back shed at their 600-year-old cottage its demand soon outgrew their facilities and was by 1954 produced in volume by Denby. The Council of Industrial Design included over fourteen of the Tigo pieces in their design review, which was an illustrated record of British designs of the highest standard. As a range it had a unique style that was essentially sophisticated, highlighted by flashes of gentle humour. Pieces ranged from utilitarian to sculptural. The expressing curving lines were enhanced by the tactile quality of black, lightly textured, matt-glazed surfaces. This was scratched using the scraffito technique to expose the white earthenware body beneath. Tigo-Ware bridged tradition with modernity. Pieces were often inspired by Hungarian folk art, yet re- interpreted in a modern 1950s style.  Tibor House  Having trained in architecture in pre-war Vienna by 1956 Reich set to work on his own house. Drawing on Bauhaus ideas of functionality and movement the house was used as both laboratory and show-room where textiles, furniture, floor and wall coverings, paint-work and lighting were thoroughly tested and shown from a practical as well as an aesthetic point of view. The 1950s house confronts experimental glass with timber, innovative concrete, steel and atomic structures, indoor gardens and sliding doors. It also has one of Britain's most famous free standing mosaic fireplaces of the 1950s dubbed the ‘flaming onion,’ cabins for his children's bedrooms and refrigerated filing cabinets for the kitchen (inspired by the Frankfurt Kitchen). A lot of these ideas were later taken up by industry. Comments about the house in 1957 included “The first imaginative use of the English open fire in a modern home. Architects can now work on from here,” Dr Jacob Bronowski, in stark contrast to Sir Norman Hartnell who stated “Monstrous without beauty. Any view through that meanly constructed window would be more pleasing than the hideous room behind”  Model Car Museum  Set up for his two sons, the museum was opened by Lord Montagu of Beaulieu in 1963. By the mid-1970s Tiatsa was the largest model car collection in Europe. It is now on display at Coventry Transport Museum and totals over 30,000 models. In 1984 the entire collection was showcased on BBC's Blue Peter programme.  Later life  Tibor Reich died in 1996 aged 79 in Stratford Upon Avon. He was survived by his wife Freda Caplan, a concert pianist who was a pupil of Frederic Lamond and his four children.

The metropolis remained active until 1369.  History  The see is attested since the early 4th century, when the Bishop of Miletus attended the First Council of Nicaea (325). In the 5th century it may have also been the seat of an Arian diocese. By 538, it had been raised to an autocephalous archdiocese. It ranked 6th to 15th among the archdioceses of the Patriarchate of Constantinople in the middle Byzantine period (7th–12th centuries) according to the various Notitiae Episcopatuum. Probably in the early 12th century—certainly by 1166—it had been raised further to the status of a metropolis (ranking 81st to 101st or 102nd in the Palaiologan period). In the 13th century, it was also referred to as Palatia, after the local Byzantine fortress of Ephesus. The see remained active until 1369, when it ceased activity due to the upheavals of the Ottoman conquest of the region.

The service has the distinction of being the last ever regularly scheduled passenger train service in Tasmania. Stokes, H.J.W. (1978) The Rise and Fall of the Tasman Limited, ARHS Bulletin, vol XXIX, number 493 November 1978, pp.237 - 244. History With the introduction of the X class in 1950, Tasmania became the first state in Australia to operate mainline diesel locomotives, and the creation of an intercity express such as the Tasman was further established by the modernisation of the system and infrastructure, such as the redevelopment of Hobart's railway station in 1951. The service initially began in April 1954, using articulated DP class railcars built in 1949/50 by Commonwealth Engineering. Operating daily, Mondays to Saturdays, the railcars carried name-boards depending on their direction of travel: *Hobart to Launceston was The Tamar *Launceston to Wynyard was the Table Cape *Wynyard to Launceston was The Launcestonian *Launceston to Hobart was The Derwent. The Tasman departed Hobart at 08:35 and arrived in Launceston at 13:08, and Wynyard at 16:45. Stopping only for passengers at Derwent Park Junction, several intermittent stops happened in between due to scheduling conflicts on Tasmania's single lines, such as at Parattah in the state's Midlands. The train would often have to wait here for down-line freight to move on through, before it could proceed. In December 1955, with an increase in patronage and the availability of purpose-built ACS articulated saloon and buffet carriages, the Tasman began being drawn by X class locomotives, often with a headboard for the service. Y class locomotives were also used. Taking approximately eight hours to wind its way through the countryside to reach its final destination, the Tasman was never considered a true \\"express\\" train even by the standards of the day; however, the TGR advertised it as such and along with its specialised service and arrangements, it was considered the state's great luxury passenger train. In the loco-hauled era, Tasman Ltd did not go into Launceston. The eastbound and westbound crossed at Western Junction; a connecting train ran out from Launceston and back, making journeys from anywhere to anywhere possible. Transport Commission 'Rail and road in Tasmania' nd, but ~1956-59 (the Holden model depicted in a hire-car advertisement). Some of the ACS carriages had tray tables; others had the hostess place a cushion on a passenger's knees to support the meal tray. The link train was upgraded to provide tea & coffee service. A typist was sent from the TGR office pool for the short return journey, then returned to her main work. Towards the end, there was an experiment playing specially-recorded music from Hobart Symphony Orchestra over the carriage public-address system. It was drowned out by the rumble from the undergear when moving. Not necessarily into the Tasman Ltd era, TGR had been the only system in Australia to operate UK-style mechanical mail-exchange equipment. Decline and termination During the 1960s and 1970s, investment in the railways of Tasmania was sufficiently low that by 1974 all suburban and regional passenger services were halted \\"temporarily\\". With the influx of greater car ownership and more investment in the state's highway system than rail, the Tasman became the last of the daily passenger trains. On 1 March 1978, the TGR was taken over by Australian National who reduced the service from six trips a week to three due to low patronage, and not long after it was announced that Tasman Limited was no longer viable. The last service departed Hobart on 28 July 1978. A railcar and some of the rolling stock has been converted into a series of shops called the Margate Train outside Margate, Tasmania.

It was built in 1930 and was a corrugated iron structure on a concrete pad. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. and It was listed on the National Register in 1983; the listing included one contributing structure and four contributing objects. The listing was shortly after 1982 Hurricane Iwa had collapsed the rice mill structure. Heavy machinery including an engine were not significantly harmed, however, and it was then thought that the structure could be restored.  Origin  The majority of the extraordinary buildings in the community Hanalei of Hawaii were built within the rice era started from the 1860s. This was a farming area where there were mostly flat lands and agriculture the main industry, there were crops like tobacco, coffee, and sugarcane. In the 1884 there was an increase in Chinese farmers, who started leasing lands and rice became the main economic crop eventually. The Haraguchi Rice Farm was founded in Hanalei by Ine and Tomijiro Haraguchi. Along with being the largest rice farm they also took part in fishing the water of Hanalei Bay. The Haraguchi Rice Mill was reconstructed in 1930. It was a one- room shack that had sections for milling, engine operation and an area for the storage of process and unprocessed rice. It had an apex style metal roof. The Haraguchi Rice Mill was shut down in 1960, which made it the last mill out of the five rice mills to be closed in Hawaii. This was due to competition from the United States and damage done by the rice birds, which eventually made the Haraguchi Rice Mill unprofitable.  Rice Production in Hanalei  Approximately 4 months after planting rice is ready to be harvested. The rice farmers in Hanalei did not have much time to rest, they planted rice all year round and when the work got intensive farmers would pool together and help each other. The rice seeds were planted into seedbeds and incorporated with organic manure 3 inches high, within several days the seeds germinate into seedlings. The most prominent rice pest in Hanalei was the Chinese Sparrow, also called the Nutmeg Manikins. They would drank the milk from the rice as it matured and ate the kernels as well. These birds had to be scared away by cans filled with stone which made noise as they pitched on the strings connecting them. The Hanalei River running through the Hanalei Valley made agricultural production more feasible due to the readily available water supply. This river was available to almost everyone on this Pacific island because of its heavy flow of fresh water.  Hawaii Rice Economy  The Haraguchi Rice Mill played a huge role in the agricultural history of Hanalei. Rice was first cultivated on the island by the Chinese first and taken over by the Japanese years after. In 1879 farmers were getting approximately $15 to $18 per bag. The Japanese rice was planted mainly for home consumption, while the Chinese rice was exported or shipped elsewhere.  Natural Disasters  The Haraguchi Rice Mill was rebuilt in 1930 after it was destroyed by a fire in March of that year. Following this disaster, in 1959 Hurricane Dot damaged the roof and air vent of the milling machine at the Haraguchi Rice Mill. Then in 1982 the mill was massively destroyed by Hurricane Iwa in the month of November. The whole milling house collapsed onto the milling machine which was safe and ready to mill again. In 1992 Hurricane Iniki passed over this disaster prone farm site once again.  Legacy  The Haraguchi Rice Mill was the fifth rice mill in Hanalei of Hawaii. It impacted families and communities in and around the island. Even though it has gone through many disasters during its time of maximum production, Haraguchi Rice Mill contributed to the islands economy where it provided jobs, increased foreign exchange earnings and established rice as a staple food for the Chinese and Japanese farmers. Today the farm has no rice on it but instead it has taro and it is a non-profit business that is facilitates personal development for schools and offer back to nature visits. This farm now makes traditional dishes freshly from taro, which is harvested straight off the farm. It still embraces its originality and traditional values in 2019. Currently the Haraguchi Farm is still own today by the Haraguchi family sixth generation, this farm is going over 100 year old. On the farm presently they have taro production; also this farm in Hanalei, Hawaii is utilized as a back to nature tour, where it's a non-profit entity. The Haraguchi Farm is now used to serve the Hawaii Island as a recreational center for tours such as schools and other tourists, in the same breathe Hawaiian students are train how to grow and harvest taro. Taro cultivation also supports small businesses in and around the community of Hanalei. From taro the by-products and other ancient dishes are made, which as a lucrative market within the community. Today the Haraguchi Family Farm is still in progress.

V. Nirmal Kumar. It stars Vijay Antony and Aksha Pardasany. Produced by Studio 9, Sri Green Productions and Vijay Antony Film Corporation, the film is a sequel to Vijay Antony's debut film Naan (2012). The film was released on 29 August 2014. Plot The plot continues two years after the incidents occurred in Naan. Karthik alias Mohammed Salim (Vijay Antony) is an honest and simple doctor working in a private hospital. He often goes out of his ways to help needy patients that come to him. His talent and nature earn wrath and jealousy of his colleagues. One day, he learns someone is stalking him. He finds it is his suitor Nisha (Aksha Pardasany), doing a background check on his character. Salim directly goes to Nisha and gives his personal diary for her to learn more about him. This response from him impresses her so much, and she falls in love with him. As their relationship progresses, Nisha learns that Salim has dedicated himself to his work, so much so that he fails to take care of her and spend time with her, thus creating a rift between them. To reconcile with Nisha, Salim plans to spend a whole day with her. They go to a movie theatre and some goons tease Nisha, but Salim, instead of fighting back, chooses to take Nisha and leave the place. Nisha gets offended by this and starts to ignore Salim and his phone calls. Meanwhile, the hospital's managing director gives Salim a warning to stop refusing fees from patients, as it affects the hospital's income. A few days later, Salim manages to convince Nisha, and they renew their relationship. Nisha asks Salim to go to a party with her, and he agrees. But when he is on the way, he sees a young girl, a gang-rape victim, who is hurt and bleeding on the road. He takes her to the hospital and misses the party. Nisha loses her temper and breaks up with him. The next day, Salim finds that the girl he admitted has been discharged from the hospital. He learns that the managing director has discharged the girl as she is poor and unable to pay the cost. The same evening, he gets an invitation to a party from his hospital. There he learns that the managing director has had enough of his charity and generosity at the hospital's cost and that he is being laid off, and it is his own farewell party. He is also insulted by the managing director for not using his talent and reputation to earn money. Salim storms out of the party in rage. On the way, he gets into a scuffle with a police officer (Aruldoss) and hits him, ending up in the police station. But he escapes with the police officer's pistol and goes straight to a hotel. There, he finds four men trying to rape the hotel singer. He beats them up and helps the girl leave the place. Saying that they have to learn their lesson, Salim takes them hostage inside the room. One of the men is the son of the Home Minister, so the police, led by a police officer Chezhian (PV Chandramouli), are pressurized to take immediate action. The police find out Salim's identity and raid his home, where they find his wedding cards and learn about Nisha. They take her into custody and to the hotel, where she meets Chezhian and explains Salim's character and that he is not a terrorist to take hostages. The police plan to use Nisha as bait and capture Salim, but they fail to do so when Salim demands the presence of the Home Minister at the hotel. Meanwhile, a police sniper takes a shot at Salim but misses, and Salim throws one of the men out of a window. He tells Chezhian to take him seriously to avoid more disastrous results. It is later revealed that the 4 men had raped the girl who Salim had admitted in the hospital. After discharging the victim from the hospital, they killed both the victim and her mother and disposed of the remains in sewage. Salim realizes he will not be left alive by the minister once he lets go of the hostages. So he demands a car for him to leave and tells the police not to follow him. This time, the minister arranges a car that is fixed with a bomb and a remote detonator. Salim continues to hold the minister's son hostage and gets into the latter's car instead. Later, the minister receives a call from his son telling him that Salim left him on the East Coast Road and escaped. The minister orders his men to bring his son back and kill Salim, who has driven away and made it look like an automobile accident. The men chase the car with trucks and crash into it, only to find it was Salim who chose to leave the car and it was the minister's son who was driving inside.

Critical response The film has received generally positive reviews from critics. Baradwaj Rangan from The Hindu wrote, \\"The director, N. V. Nirmal Kumar, subscribes to a rather charming theory: things just happen. Nisha just happens to morph into a ghost. Salim just happens to get arrested by a cop...Salim just happens to visit an old man, who dies a few scenes later, having served little purpose other than to demonstrate another facet of Salim’s goodness.

Life Rudolf von Scherer was the son of Anton Ritter von Scherer and of the writer Sophie Ritter von Scherer, née Sockl. He received his doctorate in law in 1867 at the University of Graz and was considered a disciple of Friedrich Maassen, who influenced him in the application of the historical method. Then he began the study of Catholic theology in Graz in 1869 and was ordained as a priest. After three years in pastoral ministry, he was sent to the higher education institution for secular priests the Frintaneum in Vienna, where he received his second doctorate in 1875, this time in theology. He taught at the University of Graz (from 1875), at first church history, but soon (in 1876) he became the first professor of the newly created Department of Religious Law. In 1899 he went to the University of Vienna, where he remained until his retirement in 1912. Scherer's major work, the textbook of religious law, Handbuch des Kirchenrechtes, garnered high praise. He published only two of the three planned volumes, the first in 1885 and the second in 1891. His creativity decreased after 1911 because of various physical ailments and also because of being distracted by the discord around the Oath Against Modernism. He was since 1868 a member of the Catholic Student Association AV Guestfalia Tübingen. Writings * Handbuch des Kirchenrechtes. 2 volumes. Moser, Graz 1886/1898 (PDF).

Career He is adept at playing a number of different string instruments like Italian Guitar, Flamenco Guitar, the Greek Tzouras, Chitarra Battente, Mandolin and Acoustic Guitar, to create his unique sound. His compositions express sounds of music made of popular Sicilian, Spanish flamenco and Latin rhythms and also echoes ethnic Greek, Arabian and Indian sounds. His style resembles the nuevo flamenco and world music. His passion for music began at the age of 6, when he was given his first acoustic guitar. Since then, he has been continuously perfecting his technique of Flamenco from various lands. At the age of 8, he started making his first short instrumental compositions. In his musical career, he has also composed soundtracks for several documentaries and television. Some of his songs have been used as accompanying music for programs broadcast on satellite TV in the USA over the years. Some choice tracks have been placed in satellite TV programs for the BBC, RAI, Discovery Channel, MTV and The Oprah Winfrey Show. His music also has been featured on The Landscape Channel.http://thepeoplesmusicawards.com/#artist/info/id/1439 In 2006, his first EP titled Fanusa was released, which contains the songs \\"Fanusa\\", a flamenco-derived South American track, \\"Serenade\\", inspired from Celtic music, and \\"Danza de la Luna Nueva\\", which mixes tango, flamenco and Greek music.

Due to the tactical changeover to trench warfare, from 1915 all telegraph units were renamed as army signal units (‚‘Armee- Fernsprechabteilungen‘‘) and were divided into elements that operated the existing communications network and elements responsible for the maintenance of communications and construction of new communication links. In trench warfare, cable communications were often cut by the continual barrage of enemy fire. As a result, carrier pigeons and signal dogs were often used. In addition, special optical signal sections were established.

It is one of the most well-preserved Romanesque churches on Gotland, and was possibly preceded by a stave church. Inside, the church is decorated with medieval murals from three different periods, as well as some medieval furnishings. Some wooden sculptures from the church are today exhibited in a museum in Visby. The church belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies within the Diocese of Visby.  History and architecture  Anga Church takes its name from a now vanished farmstead, mentioned in a runestone inscription at the end of the 11th century. The first church was probably built as a church for the large farm. During archaeological excavations carried out in 1946–1947, traces of burnt wood were found, indicating that the first church may have been a stave church. The presently visible Romanesque church was built during the 13th century. Thanks to dendrochronological investigations of still intact wooden details, the church can be dated quite precisely. The choir and apse were built circa 1215, and are the oldest parts of the church. The nave dates from 1250 and the tower from 1265. The church is one of the most well-preserved Romanesque churches on Gotland, and gives a good impression of how most of the churches on the island might once have looked. The interior still has a rich decoration in the form of murals. The wall paintings date from two periods, the oldest ones from the end of the 13th century. These are mostly ornamental, and unusual in that they are signed by the artist, a painter named Halvard. From the same time dates a runic inscription in Old Gutnish, which tells the name of the farmers of the parish who contributed oxen and day's works to the construction of the church, showing that the building of the church was a communal undertaking. A later set of murals depict the Passion of Christ together with legends of saints, and were made during the middle of the 15th century. The church used to house medieval wooden sculptures, the majority of which are today at the Museum of Gotland in Visby. Still in the church is the altarpiece, dating from the 1370s, and the triumphal cross from the 15th century. There is also a gravestone in the choir from the 13th century, with a runic inscription. The church belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies within the Diocese of Visby.

She was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed. Born in Ocala, Florida, Mava Lee Thomas was the only player in AAGPBL history whose father played in Major League Baseball. Her father, Herb Thomas, was a center fielder/second baseman for the Boston Braves and New York Giants in parts of three seasons spanning 1924–1927.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Softcover, 295 pp. Language: English. . Baseball Reference – Herb Thomas profile In the fourth grade, Thomas learned her baseball skills from her father, who taught her the importance of competition, practice, adversity, and teamwork. ′′Tommie′′, as her father dubbed her, attended several schools while growing up in Florida because Mr. Thomas worked as a coach and scout for the Giants organization. She heard about the AAGPBL while attending Ocala High School, where she played for the VFW team.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League The AAGPBL operated from 1943 to 1954 and gave over 600 women athletes the opportunity to play professional baseball and to play it at a level never before attained. The league was conceived by Philip K. Wrigley during World War II, under the idea of initiating the innovative project to maintain interest in baseball as the military draft was depleting major-league rosters of first-line players and attendance declined at ballparks around the country.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League History After graduating from school, Thomas attended an AAGPBL tryout at Fort Wayne, Indiana. The switch-hitter made the grade and joined the Fort Wayne Daisies for the 1951 season. Thomas earned $75 per week plus expenses with the Daisies, which was a considerable amount of money in those days, even though the girls played six nights a week and a doubleheader on Sundays. She was mostly used as a backup for Mary Rountree (C) and Jean Weaver (3B).1951 Fort Wayne Daisies At the end of the season, Thomas became concerned that poor attendance indicated an uncertain future for the league. Then, she was determined to continue playing ball and went into the US Navy to play in the female softball team, serving also as a member of the Armed Forces Recreation Society. After discharge in 1953, she played exhibition games for the Hagerstown Mollies of Maryland during two years. She got married in 1953, but the marriage lasted only two years. Thomas also finished a degree in recreation at the University of Florida and went to work for the Ocala Parks and Recreation Department in 1984, helping to establish such events as Light Up Ocala and the annual fishing derby at Tuscawilla Park, before retiring in 1995. In 1988, Thomas received further recognition when she became part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All- American Girls Professional Baseball League. In addition, Thomas and her father became the only father/daughter combination to be inducted into the Florida Baseball Hall of Fame. The AAGPBL folded in 1954. Lady pitchers, catchers, and fielders drifted into obscurity until 1992 when the film A League of Their Own was released. The film kindled a renewed interest in these trailblazers who have their own places in American history. While the film does not use real names, filmmaker Penny Marshall seemed to be aiming for realism, as her work includes fake newsreel footage and pseudo-documentary present day scenes at the beginning and end of the fictitious story. Since then, Thomas and her teammates have become the darlings of the media. They have been honored several times for their significant contributions, responding to request for autographs and corresponding with young athletes interested in hearing of their days in the AAGPBL.IMDb.com – A League of Their Own (1992 film) Thomas felt proud to be the only girl ball player with a major league father. She remembered him into playing an old-timers game in 1988 when he was 87 years old. He had spike scars on his arm from Ty Cobb, she explained in an interview. Tommie Thomas died in 2013 in her homeland of Ocala, Florida at the age of 83, following complication from Alzheimer's disease.

Daniel also has produced a number of short video pieces documenting his process and experience. His work has been featured in the book Petite Mort: Recollections of a Queer Public.

The Partnership uses science-based resources to reach consumers in the U.S. The Partnership is composed of individuals from the food industry, professional societies in food science, nutrition and health consumer groups, the United States Department of Agriculture, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration. They serve health and food safety educators nationwide, who refer to themselves as BAC! Fighters. History In 1996, a report, “Putting the Food Handling Issue on the Table: the Pressing Need for Food Safety Education”, made the case for cooperation in consumer food safety education. The Partnership for Food Safety Education was formed in 1997 when federal government agencies, industry, and consumer groups signed a Memorandum of Understanding and pledged to work together to develop the first science-based, consumer education program in food safety. This program, Fight BAC!®, and its four messages of Clean, Separate, Cook, and Chill are the main programs for consumer education in safe food handling in the United States. Original government signatories to the MOU included the Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, and Education with responsibilities of the parties as follows: “The Partnership for Food Safety Education and FDA, CDC, FSIS, CSREES, and ED will work together to develop one overarching theme or slogan akin to “Five a Day” or “Only You Can Prevent Forest Fires.” Key educational messages will be channeled through existing networks of each signator and the outlets such as the media; local, state and federal governments; public health offices; consumer-based organizations; and private sector businesses.” The IRS in 2003 issued a determination letter of the Partnership for Food Safety Education as a nonprofit, 501c3 organization. In 2010, the Partnership for Food Safety Education underwent an institutional strategic analysis that identified three focus areas for the Partnership. The Partnership supports consumer food safety education in three ways: convening, amplifying, and evaluation. Fight BAC! The Partnership for Food Safety Education is the creator of the Fight BAC! campaign. The campaign was created in 1997 as a joint effort between industry and federal government agencies to reach the public on consumer food safety education. Sixteen focus groups in six cities were conducted in the development process of the campaign.

At age 19 in 2008–09, Díaz batted .301 with a .403 on-base percentage (OBP) and .482 slugging percentage (SLG) but fielded only .930 as a regular infielder. He was third in the Serie Nacional with 24 errors. The next season, Díaz batted .282 with a .348 OBP, .363 SLG and fielded .950 as Villa Clara's starting shortstop. He tied for fifth in the Serie Nacional with 18 errors, having improved his defense. During his 2011–12 season, Díaz' offensive production continued to climb, as he batted .315 with a .404 OBP and .500 SLG. He hit 12 home runs in 270 at bats. From 2008 to 2012, Díaz, batted .308 with a .401 OBP and .444 SLG. In his Cuban National Series career, Díaz totaled 342 games, batting .307, .397 OBP, .439 SLG, 193 runs scored, 54 doubles, 27 home runs and 165 runs batted in (RBI) in 1125 at bats. He defected from Cuba in 2012 while playing with the Cuban national baseball team in a tournament in the Netherlands. He was declared ineligible to sign with any MLB teams until February 19, 2014, due to lying about his age. He spent the interim 18 months from defecting from Cuba playing in Mexico City. =Minor leagues= To audition for a contract with MLB clubs, Díaz held a showcase with fellow Cuban defector Odrisamer Despaigne on February 13, 2014. Although Díaz was initially projected to command a major league contract with a similar level of pay to other Cuban defectors such as Alex Guerrero and Erisbel Arruebarrena, his performance in the showcase did not leave the impression that he merited such a level of salary, and, further, many clubs passed on him altogether. He had left Mexico City effectively out of shape to play professional baseball. He signed a four-year contract with the St. Louis Cardinals worth $8 million on March 9. The Cardinals first assigned Díaz to the Palm Beach Cardinals of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League in 2014, and he was promoted to the Springfield Cardinals of the Class AA Texas League that season. In 47 games between both teams, he batted .273/.324/.441 with five home runs, 24 RBIs, and seven stolen bases. In 2015, while playing for Springfield, he battled injuries before he was designated for assignment on July 8, 2015. While he had benefited from talent alone while playing in Cuba, his lack of preparation had caused his performance to suffer after playing the minor leagues. However, he diligently began to prepare more and proactively ask more questions. In the last 45 games of the 2015 season after his removal from the 40-man roster, Díaz batted .333 with a .404 OBP and a .574 SLG. The Cardinals reinstated him to the 40-man roster after the season. Over the full 2015 campaign, Díaz batted .278/.339/.445 with 13 home runs and 52 RBIs over 116 total games between Springfield and the Memphis Redbirds of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. He batted .239 against right-handed pitchers, .371 against left- handers, .329 in road games and .222 in home games. He played in the Arizona Fall League following the regular season, registering a .616 SLG and .987 OPS. =St. Louis Cardinals= 2016 Díaz playing shortstop in 2016 Originally planning for Díaz to spend the 2016 season in Memphis, the Cardinals eventually moved three veteran players to accommodate him becoming the starting shortstop. On April 5, 2016, the Cardinals recalled him to the major league roster to take the place of outfielder Tommy Pham, who had departed on Opening Day two days earlier with an injury. Díaz debuted on the same day as his call-up. In his first major league at bat in the third inning against the Pittsburgh Pirates, he singled off Jon Niese for his first hit in a 6–5 loss. Initially, Díaz' presence on the roster gave the Cardinals a capable hitter with upside who could play shortstop and fill a void until the return of Rubén Tejada, who had injured himself late in spring training. Tejada himself was a replacement signed as a free agent during spring training to replace the already-established starting shortstop Jhonny Peralta, who also had injured himself and was projected to be unable to play significantly longer than Tejada. On April 8, Díaz's first major league home run contributed to the Cardinals becoming the first team in major league history to hit three pinch hit home runs in the same game. Jeremy Hazelbaker and Greg Garcia were the other pinch hitters as the Cardinals defeated the Atlanta Braves, 7–4. The previous record of two pinch hit home runs by the same team in one game was previously accomplished on 57 occasions, most recently in 2011. Tejada was reinstated from the disabled list on April 18, However, Díaz' hitting had led the Cardinals to instead retain him as the starting shortstop, thus assigning Tejada to be a utility infielder. In an 11–2 win over the San Diego Padres on April 23, Díaz garnered his first five-hit game. After collecting two hits in his first two at bats in a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks on April 25 to give him 26 hits in 52 at bats, he became the first rookie in MLB since 1900 to carry at least a .500 batting average at any point after accumulating 50 at bats, per the Elias Sports Bureau. Meanwhile, past defensive liabilities reemerged: in Díaz' first 31 games of the season, he committed nine errors. However, he garnered early attention for the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award; as of June 6, he was third in the NL in batting at .328 and had hit eight home runs with 30 RBIs. When Peralta returned from the disabled list on June 7, Díaz' sustained level of play convinced the Cardinals to displace Peralta to third base and third baseman Matt Carpenter to second base. As the season progressed, Díaz' defense notably improved; in the remaining 51 games leading up to the All-Star break, he committed six errors. On July 7, he was selected to his first MLB All-Star Game to replace Carpenter, who had been injured two days earlier. Díaz appeared as a pinch hitter with the bases loaded against Will Harris in the eighth inning, and struck out looking as the American League defeated the National League, 4−2. On July 21 against Padres in a 5−5 game, Díaz batted against Carlos Villanueva with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth inning and, this time, singled home the game-winning run for his first career walk-off hit. After sustaining a hairline fracture of his thumb during a game against Miami, the Cardinals placed Díaz on the DL on August 1. He missed all of August and the first two weeks of September. Díaz hit his first major league grand slam on September 27, 2016, his first game back after the death of his childhood friend, José Fernández. Díaz was called back out for a curtain call, where he rose his helmet high towards the sky. He stated afterwards, \\"Every time I put on a uniform, I will think of him.\\" Over his last 31 games of the season, he committed one error. Díaz batted .300 in 111 games in his rookie year, with 121 hits, 28 doubles, 17 home runs, 69 RBIs, a .369 OBP, and a .510 SLG. He played 106 games at shortstop and was fourth in the league in errors with 16. In the 2016 NL Rookie of the Year voting, he placed fifth. 2017 On April 8, 2017, Díaz hit two home runs for his first MLB multi-home run game, with one of those home runs sticking to the \\"G\\" letter of the Big Mac Land sign at Busch Stadium. The Cardinals won 10–4 over the Cincinnati Reds. Diaz began the season with a .217 batting average, and improved in the month of May. The Cardinals optioned him to Memphis on June 28, after batting .260/.293/.396, seven home runs and 20 RBIs in 71 games. He eventually lost his role as the Cardinals' starting shortstop with the emergence of rookie Paul DeJong—who finished second in the NL Rookie of the Year balloting—as a powerful batter and capable fielder. In the final game of the 2017 season, Díaz tore his hamstring. =Toronto Blue Jays= 2018 The Cardinals traded Díaz to the Toronto Blue Jays on December 1, 2017, for minor league outfielder J. B. Woodman. He began the season as Toronto's starting shortstop as Troy Tulowitzki was on the disabled list. On May 8, Díaz was placed on the disabled list with a left ankle sprain. In 110 plate appearances prior to being placed on the disabled list, he was batting .216/.273/.431 with six home runs and 13 RBIs. He was activated on June 1. For the season, Díaz hit .263/.303/.453 with 18 home runs and 55 RBIs in 130 games. =Houston Astros= On November 17, 2018, the Blue Jays traded Díaz to the Houston Astros in exchange for minor league pitcher Trent Thornton. In 2019, he batted .271/.356/.467 with nine home runs and 40 RBIs in 210 at bats. In 2020 he batted .241/.254/.483 with three home runs and six RBIs in 58 at bats. Personal life Díaz and wife Dayara have one son, born August 5, 2016. They reside in West Palm Beach, Florida in the offseason.

The diocese covers an area of 24 counties in the eastern part of the state. The see city is Charleston, home to Grace Church Cathedral and diocesan headquarters. The western portion of the state forms the Episcopal Diocese of Upper South Carolina. As a diocese of the Episcopal Church, the Diocese of South Carolina is part of the worldwide Anglican Communion and traces its heritage to the beginnings of Christianity. In a 2012 schism, then-Bishop Mark Lawrence and the majority of the leaders and parishes of the historic diocese departed from the national Episcopal Church. Lawrence's group considered their departure to be an official act of the diocese. The Episcopal Church disagreed, noting that its constitution and canons do not allow a diocese to unilaterally withdraw. The national church recognized the remaining parishes and individuals as its continuing diocese, under the new name \\"Episcopal Church in South Carolina.\\" The Right Reverend Charles G. vonRosenberg was installed as the new bishop provisional of the diocese in January 2013. Bishop Lawrence's group joined the Anglican Church in North America, and later became known as the Anglican Diocese of South Carolina. Both parties claimed ownership of diocesan property, including not only church buildings but also the name \\"Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina,\\" and related names and marks. These claims were the subject of protracted legal battles. On August 2, 2017, the South Carolina Supreme Court held in a split decision that 29 of the parishes in the lawsuit and the St. Christopher Camp and Conference Center are the property of the Episcopal Church in South Carolina and must be returned, but that the 7 remaining parish properties are owned by the Anglican Diocese of South Carolina. The S.C. Supreme Court's decision did not answer the question of who owned the use of the name \\"Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina,\\" and other associated marks. On September 19, 2019, a federal court awarded the names and intellectual property to the Episcopal Church and its South Carolina diocese.https://www.episcopalnewsservice.org/pressreleases/federal-judge- rules-in-favor-of-episcopal-church-in-south-carolina-in-trademark- infringement-case/ History =Schism and Lawsuits= During the years from 2000 to 2012, there were increasing tensions with the national church, particularly following the consecration of Mark J. Lawrence as bishop in 2008.\\"South Carolina re-elects Mark Lawrence as bishop\\" Episcopal News Service, 4 August 2007 These tensions ultimately resulted in a September 18, 2012, finding by the Episcopal Church's House of Bishops Disciplinary Board that Lawrence had \\"violated his ordination vows to ‘conform to the doctrine, discipline, and worship of The Episcopal Church’ and to ‘guard the faith, unity, and discipline of the Church,’ as well as his duty to ‘well and faithfully perform the duties of [his] office in accordance with the Constitution and Canons of this Church.'\\" On October 15, 2012, Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori notified Lawrence of this decision. She also notified him that he was not allowed to \\"perform any Episcopal, ministerial or canonical acts\\" until further action by the House of Bishops. The Bishops Disciplinary Board cited three specific actions by Lawrence which, it stated, showed his abandonment of his ordination vows. First, his support at the 2010 diocesan convention for efforts to \\"qualify the diocese’s accession to the Constitution of the Church and to remove any provision acceding to the canons of the Church, as well as proposals to amend the diocesan Canons to remove all references to the canons of the Church.\\" Second, a set of 2011 amendments to the South Carolina nonprofit corporate charter of the diocese, filed by Lawrence, \\"deleting all references to the [Episcopal] Church and obedience to its Constitution and canons.\\" Third, in November 2011, the issuance of quitclaim deeds for the real estate of every diocesan parish, in violation of the Church's Dennis Canon. According to the Reverend Jim Lewis, the canon to the ordinary for the Diocese of South Carolina, the dispute was over Schori's increasing acceptance of relativism in the church. With tensions growing between the diocese and the larger Episcopal Church, the diocese's standing committee had passed two corporate resolutions on October 2, 2012, designed to conditionally disaffiliate the diocese from the Episcopal Church and call for a special diocesan convention. These resolutions were to take effect if the national church took disciplinary action against Bishop Lawrence or other diocesan leadership. On October 15, when Bishop Lawrence was notified of the Disciplinary Board's finding, diocesan leadership stated that the two resolutions were triggered.\\"Episcopal Church Takes Action Against the Bishop and Diocese of SC\\" , Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina, accessed October 17, 2012. The special convention was held in Charleston at St. Philip’s Church on November 17, 2012. The convention affirmed the disassociation of the Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina from the national Episcopal Church, and amended the diocesan constitution and canons to remove all references to the Episcopal Church.\\"Special Convention Approves Canonical and Constitutional Amendments Regarding Disassociation\\" (November 17, 2012). Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina. The Episcopal Church, however, disputed these actions, stating that under canon law an Episcopal diocese cannot withdraw itself from the larger Episcopal Church. In a \\"Pastoral Letter\\" to the diocese, Presiding Bishop Schori wrote that \\"While some leaders have expressed a desire to leave The Episcopal Church, the Diocese has not left. It cannot, by its own action. The alteration, dissolution, or departure of a diocese of The Episcopal Church requires the consent of General Convention, which has not been consulted.\\"Episcopal News Service (November 15, 2012). \\"Presiding Bishop's Pastoral Letter to Episcopalians in South Carolina\\". She further wrote that the South Carolina diocese \\"continues to be a constituent part of The Episcopal Church, even if a number of its leaders have departed. If it becomes fully evident that those former leaders have, indeed, fully severed their ties with The Episcopal Church, new leaders will be elected and installed by action of a Diocesan Convention recognized by the wider Episcopal Church, in accordance with our Constitution and Canons.\\" Lawsuits were filed over church property, names, and symbols; some of the legal disputes remain unresolved. Following the split, the Episcopal Church organized new leadership for its diocese of the remaining parishes, priests, and church members. That diocese adopted the name \\"Episcopal Church in South Carolina,\\" since a temporary court order allowed the departing group to continue using the name \\"Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina.\\" On January 26, 2013, a special convention of the Episcopal Church in South Carolina elected The Right Reverend Charles G. vonRosenberg, retired Bishop of East Tennessee, as the new bishop provisional of the diocese. A Federal court ruled on September 19, 2019, that the name and marks belong to the Episcopal Church and its South Carolina diocese. On February 3, 2015, a South Carolina circuit court judge had ruled that the Episcopal Church in South Carolina was not entitled to the property and registered names of the Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina. The ruling affected over $500 million in church property.\\"Court rules breakaway SC Episcopal churches can keep $500 million in property\\" (February 4, 2015), The State. Accessed February 4, 2015. That ruling was appealed. On August 2, 2017, the South Carolina Supreme Court issued a split decision that effectively returned the property of 29 parishes and the St. Christopher Camp and Conference Center to the Episcopal Church in South Carolina. Each justice wrote separately. Two justices would have returned all the property in dispute to the Episcopal Church in South Carolina. Two justices found that only the 29 parishes which had affirmed their commitment to the Episcopal Church by passing a bylaw of the national church known as the \\"Dennis Cannon\\" prior to the breakaway were the property of the Episcopal Church. One justice would have allowed all of the breakaway parishes to retain their property.http://www.sccourts.org/opinions/HTMLFiles/SC/27731.pdf As a result of the mixed opinion, 29 parish properties and St. Christopher Camp must be returned to the Episcopal Church in South Carolina, while 7 other parishes own their properties. The South Carolina Supreme Court decision has been sent to Orangeburg Circuit Judge Edgar Dickson for implementation. On September 19, 2019, a federal court ruled that the name \\"Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina,\\" along with related names and marks, including the diocesan seal, legally belong to the continuing Episcopal Church diocese. The court also ruled that, legally, \\"TECSC is the lawful successor of the Historic Diocese.\\" The court noted also that it had been \\"settled by a majority of the South Carolina Supreme Court that TECSC is the lawful successor to the Historic Diocese.\\"http://www.episcopalchurchsc.org/uploads/1/2/9/8/12989303/2019-6-19_pacer_doc.pdf The Anglican diocese has announced plans to appeal this ruling. On June 19, 2020, First Circuit Judge Edgar W. Dickson reversed the 2017 judgement and ruled that the breakaway communities could retain their properties. The Episcopal Church in South Carolina vowed to take the matter back to the South Carolina Supreme Court. =New cathedral= The Cathedral of St. Luke and St. Paul affiliated with the departing diocese in the schism, leaving the continuing Episcopal Church in South Carolina without a cathedral. In November 2015, the annual diocesan convention designated Grace Church in Charleston as the new diocesan cathedral, Grace Church Cathedral. The newly-chosen cathedral was selected to host the annual diocesan convention in November 2016. Episcopal Church Presiding Bishop Michael Curry visited the diocese in April 2016, and preached during a service at the new cathedral. The Very Reverend Robert Willis, Dean of Canterbury Cathedral in England, was also in attendance to present a Canterbury cross and to celebrate \\"the newest cathedral in the Anglican Communion, which, I’ve already sensed throughout the services of this morning, is full of energy and vitality and all the sorts of things that the old Mother Church needs to encourage her life, too.\\" Bishops These are the bishops who have served the Diocese of South Carolina:The Episcopal Church Annual.

He held the New England Heavyweight title twice, from June 1994 to November 1995, and the New England Tag Team title (along with fellow wrestler Big City Mike) from November 1993 to July 1995.Graham, Melanie. \\" Former pro wrestler says he'd do it all over again\\", Milford Daily News. June, 2010 Early life John Callahan was born in Milford, Massachusetts and as early as the age of 10, he was taken with the exploits of such colorful and established professional wrestlers as George \\"The Animal\\" Steele and Manuel Soto. He soon came to realize that professional wrestling was his destiny, watching his heroes perform on the family television and thinking to himself, \\"Wow, they can do that and get away with it?\\".Graham, Melanie. \\" Former pro wrestler says he'd do it all over again\\", Milford Daily News. June, 2010 He noted that his friends joined him in the construction of a makeshift wrestling ring, or \\"squared circle\\", and imitated the mannerisms and techniques of their heroes, holding their own matches.Graham, Melanie. \\" Former pro wrestler says he'd do it all over again\\", Milford Daily News. June, 2010 As time passed and his friends went on with their lives, Callahan came to a decision which would change his life - he decided to pursue his passion and join the world of professional wrestling. In 1979, he packed his bags and left home to study the sport under the guidance of a man recognized as a true master, the legendary Edward Władysław Spulnik, better known as \\"Killer Kowalski\\", in Salem, Massachusetts.Graham, Melanie. \\" Former pro wrestler says he'd do it all over again\\", Milford Daily News. June, 2010 Education under Killer Kowalski (1979) In 1979, young John Callahan began training with Walter \\"Killer\\" Kowalski at his wrestling school at the YMCA in Salem. Kowalski found him to be a gifted pupil blessed with raw physical and athletic gifts, so much so that within just a few short months he deemed Callahan ready to turn professional.Graham, Melanie. \\" Former pro wrestler says he'd do it all over again\\", Milford Daily News. June, 2010 Callahan fulfilled his lifelong dream and officially signed a contract with the World Wrestling Federation just as the sport which was on the verge of achieving unprecedented popularity. Experiences in the World Wrestling Federation In 1979, John Callahan began his professional wrestling career with the World Wrestling Federation. With both the WWF and later, other organizations, the \\"small town\\" boy found himself traveling throughout much of North America. He had come a long way from \\"figure four leg-locks\\" and \\"sleeper holds\\" he had administered and sent his friends home sore with as a boy back in Baltimore. Callahan's first major match took place in April 1981 against another young wrestler who perhaps more than anyone helped elevate the popularity of the sport of wrestling and the WWF, Hulk Hogan. The match took place in the Boston Garden in front of a packed house, which included many of Callahan's friends and family members. Unfortunately, Callahan was defeated and later recalled, \\"All I saw was the heads (of the crowd) silhouetted by the lights.\\" Despite the loss, he was encouraged by the fact that his nervousness had melted away as soon as he got into character and entered the ring. \\"Once you start doing what you do, you forget there are 22,000 people watching.\\".Graham, Melanie. \\" Former pro wrestler says he'd do it all over again\\", Milford Daily News. June, 2010 Popular names wrestled and characters created In addition to Hulk Hogan, Callahan wrestled such notable personalities as the Junkyard Dog, Tony Atlas and Rowdy Roddy Piper. A personal favorite was his epic Allentown, PA battle against the Iron Shiek, which resulted in another Callahan defeat, this time within three minutes. The Shiek went on to wrestle Hogan himself, some two weeks later.Graham, Melanie. \\" Former pro wrestler says he'd do it all over again\\", Milford Daily News. June, 2010 With characters like Hogan, Piper, and the Shiek leading the way, the popularity of wrestling grew to unprecedented heights. Callahan recognized the significance that marketing played in this, both to the sport as well as the individual careers of the people performing within it. It was at this point that while some wrestlers took the path of the \\"good guy,\\" Callahan opted for a \\"villain\\" persona.Graham, Melanie. \\" Former pro wrestler says he'd do it all over again\\", Milford Daily News. June, 2010 Over the years he created and performed as characters such as the \\"Baltimore Terror\\", the \\"American Ninja\\", and finally \\"Big John Callahan\\". Another character he created during a wrestling stint in Quebec, Canada, was \\"Sgt. Muldoon\\". This persona was quickly dropped when a promoter asked why he had inexplicably decided to play an Irish wrestler from a world populated entirely by French- Canadiens, \\"rather than Southie\\". Ever the student of the sports entertainment aspect of professional wrestling, Callahan learned to listen to the audience and recognize where his limits were. \\"You want to work the audience so that at the end of the night, they know they saw something they want to come back and see again.\\".Graham, Melanie. \\" Former pro wrestler says he'd do it all over again\\", Milford Daily News. June, 2010 Injuries and the end of wrestling career Ultimately, like many professional athletes the mental and physical rigors of constant travel and injuries began to take their toll on Callahan. Throughout his career he battled dislocated joints and broken bones. On at least one occasion, he claims to have fought through a 10-minute match despite a dislocated knee.

Circulation director, Milford Daily News With his wrestling career over, Callahan was at a crossroads. Searching for a new direction in his career, he stumbled across a want ad for an opportunity that intrigued him. It was for the Circulation Director of the Milford Daily News in his adopted hometown of Milford, MA. The job was one he was born to perform. Given his interest in marketing, which is recognized by many in the industry as the lifeblood of any newspaper, he conceived of recognition programs for the newspaper's carriers, the most successful of which was the \\"Bonus Bucks Bonanza\\" program. In 1991, Callahan brought a celebration of \\"Newspaper Carrier Day\\" to the Milford Daily News, which was held at Fino Field in Milford. Efforts for coverage by CNN and hopes of an appearance by comedic actor Chris Elliot were unsuccessful, but Carrier Day is still seen as a highpoint in Milford Daily News history. Unfortunately, Callahan's time at the Milford Daily News was to end somewhat abruptly, when a dispute over the dismissal of an independent contractor led to a falling out with publisher Thomas Sawyer and Callahan's departure. Induction to the New England Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame (2010) Despite all of the hardships he endured in his wrestling career, Callahan always said he would go back and do it all over again if he could, perhaps, though, with some help from steroids and a \\"more vicious attitude. .Graham, Melanie. \\" Former pro wrestler says he'd do it all over again\\", Milford Daily News.

The company concentrated on producing car bodies for luxury cars, being closely associated, during the 1930s, with the products of Hispano-Suiza, Bugatti, Rolls-Royce and Bentley. In addition to their production facilities on the edge of town, Vanvooren had a show room at 33 Rue Marbeuf in the exclusive 8th arrondissement of Paris. Carrosserie Vanvooren was active between 1888 and 1950, but in terms of output and of reputation the company's golden decades were the 1920s and 1930s. History =1888 to 1929= The transfer of the business by Vanvooren to his technical director, Marius Daste, in 1921, ushered in a period of expansion. Achille Vanvooren (1857 - 1928) began his Corbevoie-based business in 1888, producing bodies for carriages and cars. The firm's reputation grew rapidly. The oldest surviving Vanvooren bodied car, dating from 1911, is a Mercedes 38/70HP, delivered to Samuel Colt, heir to his uncle's weaponry dynasty. A 1912 Vanvooren bodied Panhard & Levassor Typ X14 20HP also survives as does a Vanvooren bodied Hotchkiss 55HP Roadster from the same year. The number of car bodies produced climbed each year. In 1921 Vanvooren retired from the business he had created, handing over control to his technical director, Marius Joseph Daste. A licence was obtained from Carrossier Weymann in 1923 for the production of light-weight car bodies. Charles Weymann is remembered as an aircraft pioneer, and his car body designs, with timber frames and synthetic leather skins, clearly drew inspiration from the aircraft of the time. Vanvooren mounted Weymann designed bodies on various chassis including those of the Hispano-Suiza H6 and of the Bugattis T43 and T44. In 1927 a Vanvooren bodied Rolls-Royce \\"New Phantom\\" (chassis number 27EF) went to a British customer. This would be the first of many Vanvooren bodied Rolls-Royces. 1929 saw another milestone when company boss Marius Daste, working in collaboration with his new business partner Romée de Prandières, developed and patented a flexible metal-reinforced car-body structure, employing the \\"Silentbloc\\" rubber anti-vibration mountings and joints manufactured by a neighbouring firm called \\"Repusseau and company\\" (\\"Repusseau et cie.\\"). These were used to connect the massive steel ladder format chassis of the luxury cars of the time to the Vanvooren timber frames of the car bodies, and successfully eliminated the unavoidable squeaks and rattles that had hitherto been a feature of large coach-built cars. They also removed the risk of timber bodies becoming torn in response to excessive flexing from the steel chassis to which they were attached. =1930 to 1939= Vanvooren bodied Panhard et Levassor X14 25hp (1911) Type 50s which featured in the 24 Hours Le Mans race of 1931 Vanvooren bodied Hispano-Suiza K6 (1934) Hispano-Suiza K6 Vanvooren Pillarless Saloon. Pillarless saloon bodies were another feature patented by Vanvooren. This one dates from 1937. Rolls-Royce Wraith Faux Cabriolet with Vanvooren coachwork (1939) Daste's car body building system became public at the Paris Motor Show in 1930 where it was identified as an important advance. Almost at once more than 40 European carriage builders acquired licenses to apply the Vanvooren/Daste patent. In the same year at the London Motor Show the company's British agent, J. Smith & Co., exhibited three car bodies of this type constructed on Delage chassis, all three finished in an eye-catching two tone silver/black colour scheme, and which made a big impression. In Britain patent marketing was handled by a company called \\"Silent Travel\\" and most of the major auto-makers purchased licenses. Vanvooren caught the mood of the luxury car market in the 1930s, combining high quality standards with a careful combination of advanced style and conservative elegance. Work with Hispano-Suiza From the early years Vanvooren had worked closely with the luxury car maker Hispano-Suiza, whose French automobile factory was located in Bois-Colombes on the north-western edge of Paris, just a few hundred meters from Vanvooren's own factory. The fruitful collaboration between the two evolved during the 1930s into something comparable to the relationship developing at the same time in England between Rolls-Royce and Park Ward. In 1932 the collaborative nature of the relationship between the two businesses was further deepened when Marius Daste quit the top job at Vanvooren in order to take up an appointment as production direction with Hispano-Suiza. From 1932 Vanvooren provided the bodies for more than a third of Hispano-Suiza's output of HS26, K6 und J12 models. Work with Bugatti Romée de Prandières, previously Daste's partner at Vanvooren, stayed with the business and during the 1930s was able to build a close business relationship with Bugatti, helped by his personal friendship with the director of Bugatti's Paris agent, Dominique Lamberjack. Numerous Bugatti Types 43, 44, 46, 49, 50, 55 and 57 received their bodywork at Vanvooren's Courbevoie factory. The massive Type 46s bodied by Vanvooren included a strikingly designed body with which the model made its debut at the 1929 Paris Motor Show and Vanvooren also provided bodies for the Bugatti Type 50s which featured in the 24 Hours Le Mans race of 1931. Vanvooren were also responsible for the bodies on approximately 20 Bugatti Type 57s, including four cabriolet bodied Type 57S models. At the end of the decade, in 1939, they were commissioned to provide coachwork for a unique Type 57 commissioned by the government as a wedding present for the future Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. This car was based on a design by Figoni & Falaschi intended originally for a Delahaye 165 chassis, and has a flamboyant style quite out of keeping with the restraint characteristic of Vanvooren's other work at this time. Other French auto- makers Other French leading manufacturers of luxury cars, notably Delage und Delahaye, also supplied chassis to be equipped with Vanvooren bodies. A project to move closer to the mass market sector by collaborating with Citroën collapsed after just a handful or prototypes had been built out of a planned minimum quota of 100 cars. Working with Rolls-Royce For Rolls-Royce and Bentley,Bentley was purchased by Rolls-Royce in 1931 and progressively lost its independent identity during the 1930s, becoming by the decade's end little more than an alternative badge for Rolls-Royce cars. virtually all the manufacturer's cars sold during the 1930s in France came with Vanvooren bodies. Again, commercial collaboration was underpinned by a personal relationship: Walter Sleator, who was in charge of \\"Franco-Britannic Autos\\", Rolls-Royce's French importer, had been Vanvooren's own sales director in their prestigious Rue Marbeuf Showroom back in the 1920s. Rolls-Royce engineers were highly impressed by the Vanvooren's approach to design and production methodology. They decided to have a Bentley 3½ Litre (chassis number B187BL) fitted with a Vanvooren body featuring a pillarless sedan body, another Vanvooren patented speciality. The car body had no B-pillar, and the rear door hinges were at the rear edge of the doors, so that when both front and rear doors were opened the entire passenger area could be accessed without the encumbrance of a central pillar. The \\"Pillarless saloon\\" was subsequently made available to the leading British coach builders so that they could study it in detail. Collaboration with Rolls-Royce also led to a cooperative relationship with their leading UK based car-body builder, Park Ward. Vanvooren were mandated to develop construction methods for the production of car bodies that were as far as possible light-weight and durable despite being made of steel. In connection with this contract Rolls-Royce commissioned four Vanvooren bodies for their 20/25 model, one for a \\"New Phantom\\", one for a Phantom II, three for Phantom IIIs and seven for Rolls-Royce Wraiths. Vanvooren also collaborated extensively in respect of the company's Bentley chassis, with 69 Bentleys travelling to Paris for their bodies (16 3½ Litre cars, 46 4¼ Litre cars and 7 Bentley Mark Vs). On the product development side collaboration with Bentley extended further during the closing years of the decade. The Bentley Mark V \\"Corniche\\" scheduled to succeed the Bentley 4¼ Litre in 1940, was developed by the Paris-based dentist and part-time car designer Georges Paulin, and it was intended that the standard bodies for the car would by produced by Vanvooren. A German invasion of France was widely foreseen, but its timing and the speed of France's military collapse had not been. At the time when France fell, seven Mark V \\"Corniche\\" chassis had been delivered from Derby to Vanvooren's Paris factory, and of these four had already received their bodywork. The prototype, identified by Chassis number 14-B-V was fully finished as was a second car, carrying chassis number B12AW. Car 14-B-V was badly damaged in an accident during testing in France, and while the body work went for repair at Châteauroux, in western central France where Rolls-Royce had been trialing the car, the chassis was sent back to the Rolls-Royce plant in Derby. Back in Derby a further six Mark V \\"Corniche\\" chassis were at this time under construction. It was planned that these would be fitted with a newly developed straight-8 engine and participate in the 1940 Le Mans 24 Hour race. That never happened. Meanwhile, the now fully repaired body from the crashed prototype was sent back to the Rolls-Royce Derby plant in order to be reconnected with its chassis. However, on the dockside at Dieppe it was caught by a German air-raid and completely destroyed. Other foreign auto-makers One-off sensations during the 1930s also included a Vanvooren sporting bodied Alfa Romeo 8C 2300 in 1933 and a Mercedes-Benz 500K sedan in 1934 (supplemented, according to one source, in 1936 by an equivalent body on a Mercedes-Benz 540K chassis). 1935 saw a Vanvooren body built for a Cadillac V8 cabriolet and another for an Alvis Speed 20 which the Coventry firm presented at the Paris Motor Show as an introduction of the Alvis brand to the French auto-market. =1940 to 1950= The production facilities at Corbevoie were badly damaged by bombing in 1943, and the company's written records were all destroyed. Contemporary technical information on cars produced before then survives only, if at all, in the records of manufacturers or customers ordering Vanvooren car bodies. After the war, in 1947, work resumed at the location, albeit on a much reduced scale. The business environment for Europe's luxury car makers had changed fundamentally by the end of the Second World War. The principal auto-makers for whose cars Vanvooren had built bespoke bodies in the 1930s had either withdrawn completely from the car business, as was the case of Hispano-Suiza who were now focused on aircraft engines, or were beginning to offer customers complete cars, producing steel bodies themselves. That was the case with Rolls-Royce- Bentley whose Bentley Mark VI appeared in 1946, no doubt drawing on lessons supplied by Vanvooren's steel bodies supplied to Rolls-Royce in the 1930s. France's own luxury auto-makers were much diminished financially by the grim economic conditions of the 1940s and by government policy which consciously discriminated against cars with engines above two-litres of capacity, using both taxation policy and a dirigiste approach to the allocation of steel. Vanvooren were restricted to a handful of special orders to provide new car bodies (including, notably, a special bodied Bentley Mk VI Coupé, identified by Chassis Nbr. B332LEY) or rebuilding existing cars from before the war.

One of Montana's preeminent historians and writers, he was named by both The Missoulian and the Great Falls Tribune newspapers as one of the 100 most influential Montanans of the 20th century. His Montana: A History of Two Centuries (co-written with Richard B. Roeder) was called the \\"definitive history of the state\\" by the Bozeman Daily Chronicle.\\"Obituary for Michael P. Malone.\\" Bozeman Daily Chronicle. December 21, 1999. Accessed 2013-08-10. Early life Malone was born on April 18, 1940, in Pomeroy, Washington, to John and Delores (Cheyne) Malone.\\"Michael P. Malone, 59, Native of Pomeroy.\\" Lewiston Morning Tribune. December 24, 1999.\\"Dolores Malone Chard, 84, Pomeroy Homemaker.\\" Lewiston Morning Tribune. May 27, 1998. His father was the son of a farmer who (with his brothers) owned several farms in Garfield, Walla Walla, and Whitman counties. The Malones were of Irish descent, and Michael was deeply proud of his heritage. His mother, Delores, was born in Zillah, Washington, and his parents married on November 14, 1936. Malone's father managed McKeirnan Hardware and Implement in Pomeroy, and attended Holy Rosary Catholic Church. Michael was the Malone's only child. However, in 1954, the Malones' close friends, Jack and Kathryn Bowman, died in an automobile accident. The Malones then raised the Bowmans' four children, Ray, Wynn, Kevin, and Jennie. Michael Malone considered them his half-siblings. As a teenager, he worked harvesting peas for the Green Giant vegetable company. Michael \\"had an especially close relationship with his father\\", and he had a significant influence on Michael.Mullen, Pierce. \\"Homage to the Life and Memory of Michael Peter Malone, 1940-1999.\\" The Montana Professor. 10:1 (Winter 2000). Accessed 2013-08-10. Michael Malone later said his father was the \\"finest man he ever knew\\". John Malone suffered from severe cardiac problems in the 1960s, which worried Michael a great deal. John Malone died in 1972, and Michael believed that he lost a great deal from losing his father at an early age. Malone's mother married Ronald L. Chard of Pomeroy in 1974. She died at the age of 84 in May 1998, just 18 months before her son. Malone enrolled at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington. His initially had a pre-law major, but changed his major to history during his sophomore year. \\"I just liked the subject,\\" he said. \\"I thought it would be fun to make a career of doing for others what (historians) were doing for me.\\"Schontzler, Gail. \\"MSU President Mike Malone Dies.\\" Bozeman Daily Chronicle.

He then enrolled in the doctorate program in American studies at Washington State University in Pullman, Washington, graduating with a Ph.D. in 1966. =Academic career= Malone sought and won a teaching position at Texas A&M; University for the 1966–1967 school year. He left Texas A&M; and took a position as an assistant history professor at Montana State University in the fall of 1967. He was promoted to associate professor in 1970 and professor in 1973. He was named head of the Department of History and Philosophy in 1976. Three years later, he was appointed dean of graduate studies for the entire university. He was appointed director of the Burton K. Wheeler Center at MSU in 1987, and served in that position until 1990. He resigned as dean of graduate studies in 1988 after being named interim vice president for academic affairs. He was reappointed interim vice president twice more, in 1989 and 1990. During his academic career at MSU, Malone wrote seven books. His 1989 book, The American West (co-authored with Richard W. Etulain) was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. By 1990, he was working on a biography of James J. Hill, the late 19th and early 20th century railroad executive whose Great Northern Railway played a critical role in the economic expansion of Montana. He also traveled widely across Montana, lecturing in many of the state's small towns on Montana history. In 1972 and 1973, he and fellow MSU professor of history Richard Roeder traveled across the state to educate citizens about the newly created Montana Committee for the Humanities (now known as Humanities Montana), which greatly enhanced public participation in the agency's programs. He also lectured extensively throughout the West on a variety of topics in the history of the American West.Cantrell, Anne. \\"President Michael P. Malone Heritage.\\" Office of the President. Montana State University. No date. Accessed 2013-08-11. As dean of graduate studies, Malone was critical of what he perceived as the state's lack of foresight regarding higher education. He told the Los Angeles Times that the state legislature was unwilling to invest in academic disciplines that would help build the technology sector, and generally failed to invest in higher education as a whole. He also criticized the state for failing to teach business skills and entrepreneurship. \\"We're victims of the old mind-set, that any corporation heading for Montana must be bent on rape. Montana is the last of the Old West and we're in crisis and we're not doing the most obvious things that have to be done,\\" he said. \\"We're trying to preserve a unique life style and trying to put our feet into the future at the same time. So far we really haven't come to terms with the conflict this creates.\\"Lamba, David. \\"Wary of Change.\\" Los Angeles Times. October 23, 1986. In 1987, Malone pressed the United States Congress to make \\"tuition-remission\\" scholarships tax-exempt, so that more students would be encouraged to seek graduate education.Luther, Jim. \\"Tax Amendments Would Benefit Investors, Alaskan Children, Football Coaches.\\" Associated Press. July 23, 1987. Montana State University presidency =Appointment= Montana State University president William Tietz announced his retirement at the end of 1990.Schontzler, Gail. \\"Bill Tietz - The Maverick Who Shaped MSU.\\" Bozeman Daily Chronicle. November 2, 2007. Malone was unanimously named MSU's acting president on January 1, 1991, at a salary of $86,000 per year. After a nationwide search, the board of regents of the Montana University System narrowed the list of finalists to three: Malone; Dr. Harold Allen, vice president for graduate studies, research and economic development at the University of Toledo; and Dr. Rex Cottle, dean of the School of Business at the University of Mississippi (and later president of Lamar University in Texas). In March 1991, Malone was named MSU's 10th president. =Presidential achievements= Malone was the first MSU president to preside over the Billings, Great Falls, and Havre campuses.On July 1, 1994, Montana restructured the Montana University System. Eastern Montana College in Billings, Montana Northern College in Havre, and the Vocational-Technical Center in Great Falls lost their independence and were made satellite campuses of Montana State University. Although Montana's seven tribal colleges remained independent (as they are sponsored by sovereign nations), the state required them to integrate their teaching, operations, and academic operations with both Montana State University and the University of Montana in order to continue to receive state funding. He subsequently appointed the first chancellors of the three major campuses in 1995: Ron Sexton at Montana State University Billings, Will Weaver at Great Falls College Montana State University, and William Daehling at Montana State University–Northern. He also appointed the second chancellor at MSU-Northern, Michael Rao.Kurtzman, Laura. \\"College Leader Leaving.\\" San Jose Mercury-News. April 16, 1998. Malone's governance style was democratic and personal. Faculty, employee, and student leaders agreed that he sought input and consensus on decisions. Malone was personable and friendly to faculty, workers, and students alike. His willingness to talk one-on-one with clerical staff was \\"unusual\\", according to university registrar Chuck Nelson. Malone's friendly style extended to his relationship with the state legislature as well. Tom Stump, MSU's vice president for finances, said Malone was personally quite popular with legislators and their staff. MSU's chief lobbyist, Cathy Conover, also noted that Malone sought to provide the legislature with the right information and an honest assessment, which earned him a great deal of personal respect. During Malone's presidency, Montana State University witnessed \\"one of the greatest expansions in campus history\\", as a large number of new buildings were constructed. These included the $1 million Centennial Mall (1993), the $22 million Engineering and Physical Sciences Building (1997), the $10 million Bobcat Stadium renovation, the $13.5 million renovation of Brick Breeden Fieldhouse, the $12 million Agricultural Biosciences Building (1999), and the $7.5 million Renne Library renovation (1999). The refurbishment of the two athletics buildings was especially important. Bruce Parker, MSU's associated athletics director, said funding for these projects was directly attributable to the president: \\"None of the athletics renovations would have happened without Mike Malone\\". The stadium renovation included new public-area seating, three tiers of skyboxes, and a camera deck to permit televising of games. Inside the stadium were a new second-floor banquet room, third-floor bar and concessions area, and handicapped-accessible seating, doors, restrooms, and other areas throughout the structure. Every skybox contained indoor seating for 12, outdoor seating for 12 (with overhead radiant heating elements), and blue-and-gold floor tiled wet bars, and cost $7,000 to construct. Two-thirds of the skyboxes had been rented by the time the renovations were complete.\\"Lutey, Tom. \\"Newly Refurbished MSU Stadium a Hit With Fans.\\" Associated Press. September 7, 1998. In 1999, Malone fired Bobcats football head coach Cliff Hysell after eight losing seasons. Malone hired Mike Kramer, the winning coach at Eastern Washington University.Bergum, Steve. \\"Bad Vibes From Start.\\" The Spokesman Review. October 6, 2000. Research and enrollment were other areas where Malone achieved success. He pushed hard for faculty and the university to seek and win federal funding for scientific research. The success here was significant: Federal research funding grew from just $13 million in the late 1980s to more than $50 million in 1999. The undergraduate curriculum was revamped, and he pushed a program to \\"guarantee\\" that each student could graduate within four years.\\"Across the USA.\\" USA Today. September 13, 1994. Under Malone's leadership, enrollment at Montana State University hit a historic high of 11,746 students in 1999. Consistent with his earlier focus on technology development and education, he also established the Burns Telecommunications Center. Financial pressures were heavy during Malone's tenure. He reenergized and expanded alumni fund-raising programs and worked to have alumni become more active in campus life, and pushed the MSU Foundation to redouble its fund-raising efforts. But the state legislature kept funding for salaries stagnant. At the start of his presidency, faculty salaries were 25 percent lower than those at comparable universities.Kleinhuizen, Jeff. \\"Sprawling Montana Is An Academic Success Story.\\" USA Today. February 26, 1991. Clerical and administrative support staff represented by MEA-MFT struck for higher pay in 1992, and Malone lobbied the state legisture for higher clerical/administrative pay in 1998. =Scandals= Two minor scandals hit Montana State University during Malone's tenure: The College National Finals Rodeo declined to return to MSU, and two women's basketball coaches were fired for violating NCAA rules. Malone's consensus-building governance style was apparent in both cases, according to vice president for student affairs Allen Yarnell. College National Finals Rodeo From 1971 to 1996, the College National Finals Rodeo was held every year at the MSU campus in Bozeman.\\"College National Finals Rodeo Not Returning to Bozeman.\\" Associated Press. October 3, 1998. For years, the U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company had distributed free samples of Skoal and Copenhagen dipping tobacco to students at the event.\\"Montana State Not Giving Up On Luring College National Finals Rodeo.\\" Associated Press. September 5, 1998. The event moved away from MSU in 1997 after 1996 attendance fell 3,000 short of the 25,000-attendee goal. During that year, Malone held meetings during which it was decided that, should the rodeo finals return, smokeless tobacco products could no longer be distributed on campus. The consensus was that this was not a controversial issue.\\"College Rodeo Site Smoked Over Chewing Tobacco Flap.\\" Chicago Tribune. September 4, 1998; \\"National Rodeo Group Nixes College Site After Tobacco Giveaway Flap.\\" Associated Press. September 4, 1998. But in late August 1998, the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association (NIRA) voted unanimously to not return to Bozeman due to the no-tobacco-handouts rule. MSU rodeo coach John Larick public voiced his opposition to Malone's decision, which he called \\"disgusting\\". The Bozeman Area Chamber of Commerce also expressed its unhappiness, as the event brought about $1.2 million a year to the local economy. MSU and Bozeman business leaders attempted to compromise with the NIRA by offering to permit distribution of coupons for free or discounted tobacco products. Malone expressed his willingness to compromise, so long as tobacco was not distributed free. Despite local business opposition to the university's decision, Malone said he had received 20 positive and 13 negative comments from the public, and would stand firm. But on October 2, 1998, NIRA reaffirmed its decision not to return to Bozeman. The association said U.S. Smokeless Tobacco donated $200,000 in rodeo scholarships each year, and it would not alienate this sponsor. MSU vice president Glenn Lewis expressed his view that NIRA never seriously considered the coupon alternative. Women's basketball On October 31, 1999, Malone fired MSU women's basketball head coach Tracey Sheehan and assistant coach Jeff Malby. Complaints by student-athletes, athletics department personnel, students' doctors, and team trainers led to an NCAA investigation into charges that the two coaches were overworking their team. The NCAA found that athletes were required to engage in pre-season practice longer than the eight hours per week allowed by the NCAA. (In some cases, athletes were required to practice 16 hours a week or more.) Coaches demanded that athletes return to practice before injuries were fully healed, an excessive number of \\"overuse injuries\\" were occurring, and coaches disregarded the welfare of the athletes in their care. (NCAA rules forbid excessive practice that results in stress injuries or overuse injuries, and require coaches to follow doctors' advice when seeking to return an athlete to active status.) As many as 15 athletes on the Lady Bobcats team had overuse injuries such as stress fractures and tendonitis. The NCAA also found that the two coaches regularly exceeded the number of allowable hours for \\"athletically related activities\\" and failed to provide the mandatory \\"positive relationship between student athletes and coach...by engaging in activities which are [...] conducive to the welfare of student athletes\\".\\"MSU Women's Basketball Coaches Sheehan, Malby Fired.\\" Associated Press. November 1, 1999. The NCAA permitted Montana State to impose its own sanctions on the women's basketball program. =Criticisms= Although widely considered a successful president and very well-liked, Malone received criticism in several areas. In 2009, MSU chief legislative lobbyist Cathy Conover said that relations with the state legislature had been somewhat poor under Malone (although she did not name him explicitly). She expressed her opinion that MSU officials talked too much about how little money they had, and criticized the legislature too much for not investing in higher education. She believed that Malone's successor, Geoffrey Gamble, had a far more positive style that was \\"a sea change\\" and which led the Republican-dominated state legislature to rave about him.Schontzler, Gail. \\"Geoff Gamble - A Hard Act to Follow.\\" Bozeman Daily Chronicle. August 29, 2009. Gamble himself implicitly criticized some of Malone's financial decisions. The football stadium renovations, he noted, had gone ahead even though MSU did not have the money in-hand to pay for them. That, he noted, was a common budgetary tactic at MSU. One of the first financial rules Gamble laid down when his presidency began was to pledge that the university would not initiate projects without having the money to complete them. Others also questions Malone's financial priorities. Tuition doubled during his time in office, angering students. Some faculty criticized his willingness to construct new buildings while declining to pay for teaching equipment (copiers and projectors) and maintenance (such as fixing broken or defective thermostats). According to the Bozeman Daily Chronicle, Malone tried to respond to these criticisms by rescinding some budget cuts, and by creating a new faculty/student/worker budget committee to make recommendations about spending priorities. =Death= Malone was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in 1995. According to physicians, his heart was damaged by an undetected viral infection some years earlier, and was greatly enlarged and weakened. Michael P. Malone died at 1:15 a.m. at Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport. He had traveled to Washington State University, where officials were trying to recruit him for the open university presidency there. Malone, however, had expressed his desire to remain at MSU. He exited the airport parking lot in his own vehicle, and suffered sudden cardiac death after driving just a few yards. His vehicle struck a street light and came to a stop. Other passengers on the flight stopped and rendered first aid. The Belgrade Fire Department, Montana Highway Patrol, and a local ambulance crew all responded to the scene. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was administered, and paramedics attempted to defibrillate him with electric shocks. These efforts failed, and he was pronounced dead of a heart attack at 1:15 A.M. His funeral was a private Catholic funeral Mass, and he was buried in the Catholic section of Sunset Hills Cemetery. Other roles Malone was active in history, professional, and other organizations throughout his life. He was a member of the board of directors of the National Association of State Universities and Land-grant Colleges (now known as the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities), and was chair of its International Commission. He was also a board member of the Commission on Colleges of the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities and the Western Association of Graduate Schools. In addition to his many roles at Montana State University, he also served on the board of directors of the Montana State University Foundation and the board of trustees of the Museum of the Rockies. Malone served his profession in a wide range of ways. he was a member of the board of directors of the Montana Historical Society, the executive council of the Western History Association, the Montana Committee for the Humanities, and the Montana Bicentennial Commission. He was also a member of the editorial board of Montana, The Magazine of Western History, Pacific Northwest Quarterly, and the Pacific Historical Review. Legacy Michael P. Malone was widely respected as a historian of Montana and the American West. The Great Falls Tribune and The Missoulian, two large Montana newspapers, each named him one of the 100 most influential Montanans of the 20th century. He was regularly interviewed in print and on television on various history subjects, including a lengthy segment for the PBS documentary series, The Irish in America. His popularity at MSU led to several awards and honors from the college. In 1999, the university established the Michael P. Malone Professor of History endowed chair in his honor. Nearly $50,000 was raised for the endowment in the first week after his death.\\"State and Regional.\\" Associated Press. December 29, 1999. Dr. Billy G.

November 25, 2002. Accessed 2013-08-11. Publications At the time of his death, Malone had written nine books and 20 articles. Among these were Montana: A History of Two Centuries, co-written with Richard B. Roeder. It was first published in 1976 and a revised edition (co-written with William L. Lang) issued in 1992.Upchurch, Michael. \\"Some Titles From the Northwest Bookshelf.\\" Seattle Times. June 7, 1992; \\"UW Press Has 2 New Books Coming in March.\\" Lewiston Morning Tribune. February 7, 1992. One Montana newspaper called it \\"the standard text on state history\\". Malone published The Battle for Butte in 1981. Lang, professor of history at Portland State University, called it \\"[o]ne of Malone's most important books\\" because it focused less on biography and parochially on Butte and analyzed the broader trends and pressures being exerted by emerging national corporations and economic consolidation. His last work was Montana Century, a richly photographed coffee table book public in October 1999. It sold 13,000 copies in its first three months and by December 1999 was in its third printing. In 1989, Malone and co-author Richard W. Etulain finished The American West. It was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. When he died, Malone had a contract with Yale University Press to write a new book reconceptualizing the history of the American West. Malone had a reputation as an excellent scholar and writer. Retired MSU professor of history Jeff Safford noted that Malone tended to synthesize the work of others with his own research, and was much more interested in the exercise of power than mere \\"who\\" and \\"where\\". Journalist and author Timothy Egan, writing for the New York Times in 1993, argued that Malone avoided both the traditional cowboys-and-Indians view of the American West as well as the historical revisionism of \\"New West\\" historians. Malone argued for a return to source materials such as diaries and memoirs of the time, which neither treated settlers and Native Americans as if they were in a John Wayne movie nor made them out to be homogeneous outcasts. Original source materials, he argued, showed the West to be diverse and much more interesting than the more common depiction of white hard-scrabble farmers made it out to be.Egan, Timothy. \\"Offspring of Indians and Settlers Edit Histories of the Oregon Trail.\\" New York Times. May 31, 1993. According to Lang, Malone's emphasis on national and global factors in the history of the American West was controversial. Yet, it also had a significant impact at larger, reputable university history departments at Yale and Harvard. Malone did not stop practicing his profession once he became a university administrator. Although he did not have as much time to conduct research and write as he was promoted,Etulain, Richard W. \\"Preface.\\" In Richard W. Etulain and Michael P. Malone.

It is the first aircraft carrier to be built in India. The name Vikrant (Sanskrit vikrānta, literally \\"stepping beyond\\") means \\"courageous\\". The motto of the ship is Jayema Sam Yudhi Sprdhah, which is taken from Rigveda 1.8.3 and can be translated as \\"I defeat those who fight against me\\". Work on the ship's design began in 1999, and the keel was laid in February 2009. The carrier was floated out of its dry dock on 29 December 2011 and was launched on 12 August 2013.India launches first indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant Times of India 12 August 2013 As of 2020, the ship is expected to start sea trials in December 2020 and enter into service in end of 2021. The project cost has escalated, by 2014, to . With an additional authorised for phase III, in 2019. Background In 1989, India announced a plan to replace its ageing British-built aircraft carriers, and (ex-HMS Hermes (R12)), with two new 28,000-ton Air Defence Ships (ADS) that would operate the BAe Sea Harrier aircraft. The first vessel was to replace Vikrant, which was set to decommission in early 1997. Construction of the ADS was to start at the Cochin Shipyard (CSL) in 1993 after the Indian Naval Design Organisation had translated this design study into a production model. Following the 1991 economic crisis, the plans for construction of the vessels were put on hold indefinitely. In 1999, then-Defence Minister George Fernandes revived the project and sanctioned the construction of the Project 71 ADS. By that time, given the ageing Sea Harrier fleet, the letter of intent called for a carrier that would carry more modern jet fighters. In 2001, CSL released a graphic illustration showing a 32,000-ton STOBAR (Short Take-Off Barrier Arrested Recovery) design with a pronounced ski jump. The aircraft carrier project finally received formal government approval in January 2003. By then, design updates called for a 37,500-ton carrier to operate the MiG-29K. India opted for a three-carrier fleet consisting of one carrier battle group stationed on each seaboard, and a third carrier held in reserve, in order to continuously protect both its flanks, to protect economic interests and mercantile traffic, and to provide humanitarian platforms in times of disasters, since a carrier can provide a self-generating supply of fresh water, medical assistance or engineering expertise to populations in need for assistance. In August 2006, then-Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Arun Prakash stated that the designation for the vessel had been changed from Air Defence Ship (ADS) to Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC). The euphemistic ADS had been adopted in planning stages to ward off concerns about a naval build-up. Final revisions to the design increased the displacement of the carrier from 37,500 tons to over 40,000 tons. The length of the ship also increased from to over . Design It is long and wide, and displaces about . It features a STOBAR configuration with a ski-jump. The deck is designed to enable aircraft such as the MiG-29K to operate from the carrier. It is expected to carry an air group of up to thirty aircraft, which will include up to 24–26 fixed-wing combat aircraft, primarily the Mikoyan MiG-29K, besides carrying 10 Kamov Ka-31 or Westland Sea King helicopters. The Ka-31 will fulfill the airborne early warning (AEW) role and the Sea King will provide anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capability. A schematic diagram of INS Vikrant Vikrant is powered by four General Electric LM2500+ gas turbines on two shafts, generating over of power. The gearboxes for the carriers were designed and supplied by Elecon Engineering. The ship's combat management system (CMS) was developed by Tata Power Strategic Engineering Division in collaboration with Weapon and Electronics System Engineering Establishment and MARS, Russia. It is the first CMS developed by a private company for the Indian Navy, was handed over to the Navy on 28 March 2019. =Carrier air group= India considered a number of aircraft for operation from its INS Vikramaditya and the planned indigenous aircraft carrier. India evaluated the Russian Sukhoi Su-33, but chose the lighter Mikoyan MiG-29K as Vikramaditya was smaller and lacked an aircraft catapult. On 18 January 2010, it was reported that India and Russia were close to signing a deal for 29 MiG-29K fighters to operate from IAC-1. In addition, the navy signed a deal for six naval-variants of the HAL Tejas. In June 2012, Flight Global reported that the Indian Navy was considering the use of Rafale M (Naval variant) on these carriers. In December 2016, the navy announced that the HAL Tejas was overweight for carrier operations, and other alternatives would be looked at. Construction INS Vikrant under construction at Cochin Shipyard in 2017 Vikrant is the first aircraft carrier to be designed by the Directorate of Naval Design of the Indian Navy and the first warship to be built by Cochin Shipyard. Its construction involved participation of a large number of private and public firms. The keel for Vikrant was laid by Defence Minister A.K. Antony at the Cochin Shipyard on 28 February 2009. The AB/A grade steel which was supposed to be supplied from Russia faced problems in delivery. To resolve this, the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL) and Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) created facilities to manufacture the steel in India. Reportedly, 26,000 tonnes of three types of special steel for the hull, flight deck and floor compartments were manufactured at the Bhilai Steel Plant, Chhattisgarh and Rourkela Steel Plant, Odisha. Due to this, this is the first ship of the Indian navy to be built completely using domestically-produced steel. The main switch board, steering gear and water tight hatches have been manufactured by Larsen & Toubro in Mumbai and Talegaon; high-capacity air conditioning and refrigeration systems have been manufactured in Kirloskar Group's plants in Pune; most pumps have been supplied by Best and Crompton; Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL) supplied the Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS), which is being installed by Avio, an Italian company; the gear box was supplied by Elecon Engineering; and the electrical cables are being supplied by Nicco Industries. Fincantieri provided consultancy for the propulsion package while Russia's Nevskoye Design Bureau designed the aviation complex The keel for Vikrant was laid by Defence Minister A.K. Antony at the Cochin Shipyard on 28 February 2009. The ship uses modular construction, with 874 blocks joined together for the hull. By the time the keel was laid, 423 blocks weighing over 8,000 tons had been completed. The construction plan called for the carrier to be launched in 2010, when it would displace some 20,000 tonnes, as a larger displacement could not be accommodated in the building bay. It was planned that after about a year's development in the refit dock, the carrier would be launched when all the major components, including underwater systems, would be in place. Outfitting would then be carried out after launch. As per the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), sea trials were initially planned to commence in 2013, with the ship to be commissioned in 2014. In March 2011, it was reported that the project had been affected by the delay in the delivery of the main gearboxes for the carrier. The supplier, Elecon, attributed it to having to work around a number of technical complexities due to the length of the propulsion shafts. Other issues resulting in delays included an accident with a diesel generator and an issue with its alignment. In August 2011, the Defence Ministry reported to the Lok Sabha that 75% of the construction work for the hull of the lead carrier had been completed and the carrier would be first launched in December 2011, following which further works would be completed until commissioning. On 29 December 2011, the completed hull of the carrier was first floated out of its dry dock at CSL, with its displacement at over 14,000 tonnes. Interior works and fittings on the hull would be carried out until the second half of 2012, when it would again be dry-docked for integration with its propulsion and power generation systems. In July 2012, The Times of India reported that construction of Vikrant has been delayed by three years, and the ship would be ready for commissioning by 2018. Later, in November 2012, Indian English-language news channel NDTV reported that cost of the aircraft carrier had increased and the delivery has been delayed by at least five years and is expected to be with the Indian Navy only after 2018 as against the scheduled date of delivery of 2014. Work then commenced for the next stage of construction, which included the installation of the integrated propulsion system, the superstructure, the upper decks, the cabling, sensors and weapons. =Launch= INS Vikrant during its launch in August 2013 In July 2013, the Defence Minister A. K. Antony announced that Vikrant would be launched on 12 August at the Cochin Shipyard. The ship was launched by his wife, Elizabeth Antony, on 12 August 2013. Extensive sea trials were expected to begin in mid of 2017 and the ship will be inducted into the navy by late 2018. According to Admiral Robin Dhowan, about 83% of the fabrication work and 75% of the construction work had been completed at the time of launching. He said that 90% of the body work of the aircraft carrier had been designed and made in India, about 50% of the propulsion system, and about 30% of its weaponry. He also said that the ship would be equipped with a long range missile system with multi-function radar and a close-in weapon system (CIWS). After the launch, Vikrant would be re-docked for the second phase of construction, in which the ship would be fitted with various weapons and sensors, and the propulsion system, flight deck and the aircraft complex would be integrated. =Undocking and fitting-out= INS Vikrant during its undocking in June 2015 Vikrant was undocked on 10 June 2015 after the completion of structural work. Cabling, piping, heat and ventilation works will be completed by 2017; sea trials will begin thereafter. By October 2015, the construction of the hull was close to 98 percent complete, with flight deck construction underway. The installation of machinery, piping and the propeller shafts was in progress by January 2016; it was reported, however, that there were delays in the delivery of equipment from Russia for the carrier's aviation complex. By May 2017, the procurement delays had been resolved and the carrier's fitting-out was 62% complete, with trials of the auxiliary systems scheduled by late 2017. In February 2020, all the major structural and outfitting work was declared complete by the government. As of September 2020, Vikrant completed harbour trials while the basin trials will start from October 2020 to check propulsion, electric transmission and shafting systems. = Sea trials = On 31 October 2019, Cochin Shipyard received a contract for the Phase-III of the project. This contract includes funds for the harbours trials, sea trials and support for the ship during its weapons and aviation trials after its delivery. In December 2019, it was reported that the engines on board the ship were switched on. =Completion and Commissioning= The ship's completion and commissioning has been delayed several times. Vikrant was originally intended to be delivered in December 2010 and commissioned in 2016. This was later postponed, with sea trials to begin in 2017 and commissioning planned for 2018. In July 2016, the Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG) published a 2014 project plan, supplied by the Cochin Shipyard, that shows an expected completion date in 2023, though the Navy hoped to partially commission the ship before this date. In December 2017, the Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Sunil Lanba announced that the ship was expected to be commence sea trials and be commissioned in 2020. In January 2018, Commodore Chowdhary, the principal director of naval design, announced the remaining procurement delays stalling Vikrants construction had been resolved, and that the carrier would be completed and delivered by December 2018; it would then undergo two years of sea trials before its expected commissioning in October 2020. The start of the warship's trials was initially scheduled to begin on 12 March 2020, however construction delays caused that to be moved back to April. With the COVID-19 crisis, the navy says trials are unlikely to begin before September/October. During the Navy Day press meeting in December 2019, Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh said the INS Vikrant would be fully operational before the end of 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic has already pushed that back to 2023 and further delays are possible. Indian Navy is expecting to commission Vikrant by the end of 2021. A part of the blame for the delay in delivery of INS Vikrant was attributed to the delay in the supply of aviation equipment from Russia. In response to a question in the Rajya Sabha (upper house of Indian Parliament), Sripad Naik, the minister of state for defence stated: \\"Ship's targeted delivery was affected due to delay in supply of aviation equipment from Russia\\". In March 2020 it was revealed that Indian Navy after commissioning the aircraft carrier will deploy the ship at L&T;'s shipyard in Kattupalli near Chennai. This was done as the planned naval base in Rambilli near Vishakhapatnam is not ready yet. The navy wants to lease a 260 m berth at Kattupalli shipyard, for 8 years between 2022 and 2030 for interim berthing of the ship, by which time the naval base at Rambilli is expected to come up.

Overview Communication about the likely future course of monetary policy is known as \\"forward guidance\\". Individuals and businesses will use this information in making decisions about spending and investments. Thus, forward guidance about future policy can influence financial and economic conditions today. The strategy can be implemented in an explicit way, expressed through communication of forecasts and future intentions, sometimes known as Odyssean forward guidance. Implied forward guidance also exists, sometimes referred to as Delphic forward guidance. It is a softer and less-binding version of forward guidance to achieve similar effects. Among the main central banks, Delphic forward guidance dominates, although there are a couple of exceptions such as the US Federal Reserve, which makes quite specific but still conditional statements, and the Bank of Japan. History The communication policy of the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States has evolved over time. The current policy is known as \\"forward guidance\\" but this is quite recent. In fact, starting in 1994 the decisions of scheduled meetings have been announced to the public within a few minutes of 2:15 pm Eastern Time. Prior to 1994 monetary policy decisions were not announced, and investors had to indirectly infer policy actions through the size and type of open market operations in the days following each meeting. In the current context, this could be called \\"reverse guidance\\". The policy of \\"forward guidance\\" came about in the early 2000s. This has apparently resulted in a market-timing strategy, in use since 1994, \\"where the S&P500; index has on average increased 49 basis points in the 24 hours before scheduled FOMC announcements. These returns do not revert in subsequent trading days and are orders of magnitude larger than those outside the 24-hour pre-FOMC window. As a result, about 80% of annual realized excess stock returns since 1994 are accounted for by the pre-FOMC announcement drift\\". In fact, about half of the realized excess stock market returns between January 1980 and March 2011 were earned during the \\"pre-FOMC\\" window whereas there is no evidence of pre-FOMC returns before 1980. The drift is generally not dependent on either the macro economic state, market trends or action taken by the FOMC  References  Category:Monetary policy ","title":"Forward guidance"},{"id":"40221142","text":"William A. Reuben (1915 or 1916 – May 31, 2004) was an American journalist and writer who focused on the Rosenberg and Hiss cases. Background Reuben was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1915 or 1916. He studied at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and Graduate Faculty of English at Columbia University. Career In the 1930s, Reuben wrote for Condé Nast Publications publications Vogue and House and Garden. Then he wrote on staff for staff member of Judge and Scribner's magazines. He served as a lieutenant with the 45th Infantry Division in World War II and was wounded three times. After the war, he contributed to Pageant magazine, New York Daily Compass, The National Guardian, and The Nation. He also began his career as an investigative journalist. He covered the so-called Trenton Six case: the trial of six young black men charged and convicted with the murder of a Trenton, New Jersey, junk-shop dealer. Thanks in part to his coverage, the defendants received a new trial, in which four were acquitted and the other two given life imprisonment (later six to ten years in prison). He served briefly as national publicity director for the American Civil Liberties Union. In the early 1960s, he began work on the case of Dr. Robert Soblen, charged with conspiracy to commit espionage. He then investigated the case of Mark Fein, a wealthy New Yorker accused and convicted of murdering his bookie. Reuben continued his journalism career throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. =Rosenberg case= In August 1951, Reuben started writing articles about the Rosenberg trial. When readers began sending money in, he and his friends formed their committee \\"in my Manhattan apartment\\" in October 1951. They used the monies to publish the trial record with Reuben's Guardian articles in pamphlet form. He became provisional chairman of the Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case, to bring national attention to the cases of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg and Morton Sobell. Regarding \\"worldwide public relations campaign to save Julius and Ethel Rosenberg\\" in the 1950s, Reuben stated in 1999, \\"It was I and five friends who organized this campaign. No Russian or Communist agents orchestrated our activity; no such people exerted control over us.\\" In 1983, he filed a libel lawsuit against Ronald Radosh and Joyce Milton, authors of the book The Rosenberg File. =Hiss case= In 1956, Reuben published a first book on the Hiss case. Thereafter, he spent the rest of his re-examining evidence in the Hiss Case, \\"a task that would occupy him for the rest of his life.\\" In 1974, in pursuit thereof, under the Freedom of Information Act Reuben asked that the FBI release all Hiss Case documents. A lawsuit followed, filed by the New York City firm of Rabinowitz, Boudin and Standard and sponsored by the National Emergency Civil Liberties Foundation. This resulted in the release of 300,000 pages of copied documents from the files of the FBI and other agencies. These documents helped a lawsuit by Hiss which tried but failed to overturn his conviction, based on his allegation of misconduct by the FBI and Justice prosecutor, Thomas Francis Murphy. He published a \\"footnote\\" on the case in 1983. Personal life Reuben considered himself a student of English semantics. He also considered himself a lifelong friend of Alger Hiss: > To still others, many of them on the left, Mr. Hiss was what William Reuben, > a friend and the author of one of the dozens of books on the case, called an > American saint: an idealistic New Dealer and rising star in the foreign > policy establishment whose career was ruined when he was framed, in part to > discredit the New Deal. Whenever the topic of the Hiss Case arose in print, one could expect Reuben to partake, including: the 1992 Volkogonov affair, Allen Weinstein's book The Haunted Wood, Death Reuben died of natural causes on May 31, 2004, in New York City, at the age of 88.

Written and produced by lead vocalist Jared Leto, \\"Do or Die\\" explores the feeling of standing up and living one's dreams using also ironic undertones. The song is styled in electronic rock and imbued with elements of arena rock. It was serviced to mainstream radio in July 2013 in Europe, and was released as a promotional single in the United States in March 2014. A version of the song remixed by Dutch music producer Afrojack was digitally released in March 2014 and later included on the deluxe edition of Afrojack's debut studio album Forget the World (2014). \\"Do or Die\\" received positive reviews from music critics, who hailed its musical diversity and its euphoric but minimalistic nature. It charted in some nations due to digital sales from the parent album. The accompanying music video, directed by Leto, features live footage of Thirty Seconds to Mars onstage as well as stories from their fans, personally interviewed by Leto. The video garnered general acclaim from critics, who lauded its atmosphere and simplicity. The song was included in the setlist of the band's Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour and the subsequent Carnivores Tour. Recording and composition \\"Do or Die\\" was written and produced by Jared Leto. It was engineered by Jamie Reed Schefman and mixed by Serban Ghenea. John Hanes engineered it for mixing at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The song was recorded at The International Centre for the Advancement of the Arts and Sciences of Sound in Los Angeles, California and mastered by Howie Weinberg and Dan Gerbarg at Howie Weinberg Mastering. Thirty Seconds to Mars unveiled six songs from their fourth studio album Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams, including \\"Do or Die\\", during a preview event held at the Electric Lady Studios in New York City on March 14, 2013. \\"Do or Die\\" is an electronic rock song with influences and elements from arena rock. It opens with a female voiceover introducing the song's title in the Chinese language, after which there is an electronic introduction. This is followed by the sound of guitars, drum beats and synthesizers. After the first verse, the pre-chorus follows, with Leto voicing the line, \\"I will never forget the moment\\". The full-throated chorus then follows, which features heavy use of synthesizers and drums. The song includes a contribution from the band's fans, credited as the Knights of the White Shadow, who provide additional vocals recorded at the band's studio. In an interview with PureVolume, Leto explained that the song is \\"about standing up and living out your dreams\\", but also features an ironic connotation. Markos Papadatos, in his review for Digital Journal, called it an \\"upbeat\\" song which \\"deals with one taking their own stance on their beliefs, and living life to the fullest\\". In a preview of the record, Jeff Benjamin from Fuse described the song by saying that the band goes \\"the synthy dance route on the track's intro before fire-alarm guitars and pummeling drums roar in and smash the Korg keyboards to bits\\". Release \\"Do or Die\\" was released as a promotional single in Europe in July 2013 through Virgin Records. The song debuted at number 98 on the Ultratip chart of Belgium's Flemish region on August 24. The following week, it jumped to number 73 and peaked at number 40 on September 21. On August 30, 2013, it debuted at number 75 on the Ö3 Austria Top 40. In the Czech Republic, the song entered the national airplay chart at number 91 on the week ending October 20, 2013.

It entered the UK Rock Chart at number 38. After four weeks, the song peaked at number seven on the issue dated September 28, 2013. \\"Do or Die\\" was used by Major League Baseball as the theme song for the 2013 Major League Baseball Postseason.

In March 2014, it was announced that Dutch music producer Afrojack and Thirty Seconds to Mars had collaborated on a remixed version of the song. It became commercially available for download in March 2014 and was later included on the deluxe edition of Afrojack's debut studio album Forget the World. Leto described the collaboration by saying, \\"It was a lot of fun, and it's kind of our little summer song. I think it's good to do things that are unexpected. It keeps it exciting and collaboration is always an interesting thing.\\" The remixed version of \\"Do or Die\\" entered the Dutch Top 40 at number 53 on April 19, 2014. After five weeks, it peaked at number 42. The song debuted at number 46 on US Dance/Electronic Songs and reached a peak of number 33 on June 7, 2014.

It entered the Billboard Alternative Songs chart at number 39 and peaked at number 20 on the issue dated October 11, 2014. It debuted on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart at number 40 on August 9. Critical reception \\"Do or Die\\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Emily Zemler, of Billboard, wrote that between the album's \\"eclectic experimentation\\" and \\"voiceless soundscapes\\", the band \\"slotted in this propulsive rocker, an arena-ready anthem\\". She considered \\"Do or Die\\" to be one of the album's \\"most straightforward tracks\\". Dan Slessor of Alternative Press praised it as one of the album's highlights, in which Thirty Seconds to Mars exercises their capacity for writing \\"titanic choruses full of sweeping drama in a manner that is almost untouchable\\". Brent Faulkner from PopMatters gave a mixed response, writing that the song \\"relies on a familiar beat as well as liberal layering\\". Writers for Contactmusic commended \\"Do or Die\\" as one of the standout songs on Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams and a \\"slow-burning hit of epic, synth-heavy electronica\\". Kaitlyn Hodnicki from Stature magazine was impressed with the song, calling it one of the album's more upbeat tracks, which \\"blooms into another epic soundscape led by [Leto's] vocals and some brilliantly used electronic elements\\". She felt that the fans' vocal contribution to the song harks back to previous album This Is War without sounding \\"cliché or overdone\\". Sarah O' Hara from Lowdown also responded positively to the track, writing that \\"glorious chants fuel the uplifting 'Do or Die'\\". In a mixed review, John Watt from Drowned in Sound called the song \\"half-baked synth-rock.\\" Markos Papadatos from Digital Journal rated it an A and wrote that \\"the band soars as whole on this tune\\", calling Leto's vocals \\"raw, powerful and captivating.\\" Music video =Background= The music video for \\"Do or Die\\" was directed by Leto, who was credited as pseudonym Bartholomew Cubbins. Leto developed its concept as a companion piece to the music video of \\"Closer to the Edge\\" (2010), shot during the Into the Wild Tour. \\"Do or Die\\" was filmed in the summer of 2013, during a European leg of the Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour and features live footage of Thirty Seconds to Mars onstage as well as fan commentary. It premiered on August 5, 2013. Leto personally interviewed the band's fans, termed as the Echelon, who shared stories about the importance of music in their lives, some personal struggles and their own dreams. In an interview with MTV News, the frontman explained that he was inspired by the will to document the personal changes experienced by the band and its audience. \\"Most of the interviews\\", Leto explained, \\"I did myself, so they're really intimate. It's me, it's them, and it's the camera. What I've found is, that if you talk to everybody long enough, you find an incredible story. Every single person has a moment in their life, something that they've found a solution for, a story to tell. Some are funny, some are really intriguing, and if you ask the right questions, you get interesting answers.\\" The music video begins with a German boy who Leto had previously met in Berlin. He spoke about the loss of his father and how he had played a Thirty Seconds to Mars song at the funeral. After Leto again met the German fan again at a concert in Austria, he asked him to share his story on camera. Leto explained, \\"At the show in Austria, where there were tens of thousands of people, and I ran into him and interviewed him; he was the first interview of the summer, and he shared this story about losing his father, and what it taught him, it was really an organic and serendipitous and beautiful way to begin. He shared a really personal part of himself and we're really grateful to him, and that continued throughout all the interviews.\\" =Reception= Upon its release, the video received general acclaim from critics and fans. James Montgomery from MTV described it as a love-letter to the band's fans and a document of life on the road. He also considered it the \\"spiritual sequel to their stirring 2010 live clip\\" for \\"Closer to the Edge\\". Karen Bliss of Noisecreep was impressed with the video and opened her review by writing, \\"Thirty Seconds to Mars never fails to impress with what they can do within the confines of a music video.\\" She believed that its simplicity turned out to be \\"impactful, touching and uniting\\". Garon Cockrell from The Pratt Tribune gave the video a positive review, calling it \\"excellent\\". John Walker from MTV felt that throughout the fans' personal struggles \\"music has helped these individuals persevere and continue to enjoy life. Likewise, Thirty Seconds to Mars seem so moved by the audience's emotions every time they perform live, 'Do or Die's concept seems to be that they want to return the favor.\\" Writers for MuchMusic noticed the band's tradition for producing unconventional music videos and praised \\"Do or Die\\" calling it \\"another epic\\" short film. Markos Papadatos of Digital Journal found it \\"compelling and visually striking\\", noticing real-life people from all over the world telling their \\"moving stories\\" about their aspirations and dreams. Sean Fitz-Gerald, writing for Mashable, called the video \\"an inspiring anthem featuring heartfelt, fan-filmed messages\\". Live performances \\"Do or Die\\" was first performed at special concerts, dubbed as Church of Mars, in May 2013, shortly before the release of the album. The song later became a set-fixture of the Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour, usually appearing as the penultimate song before \\"Up in the Air\\". However, after the festival tour in June 2013, which saw the band travel to Rock am Ring and Rock im Park as headline act, the song was moved to the middle of the setlist, usually played before Leto's acoustic B-stage set. \\"Do or Die\\" was also included in the Carnivores Tour, which Thirty Seconds to Mars co-headlined with Linkin Park, and usually appeared approximately halfway through the set. Reviewing a concert, Payal Patel from AXS called \\"Do or Die\\" a \\"sweeping rock anthem\\", while Ben Jolley of the Nottingham Post described a performance of the song as energetic and inspirational. On September 23, 2014, Thirty Seconds to Mars performed the song on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, featuring a ten-person choir. During the performance, Leto swung a flag bearing messages in support of certain social goals, and invited the audience to join the band on stage towards the finale, as confetti fell from the ceiling. Markos Papadatos, writing for Digital Journal, commented that the performance was another indication that Jared Leto is one of the \\"most charismatic live performers\\" in contemporary rock and that Thirty Seconds to Mars \\"is always able to put on a high-energy show\\".

The school is built upon the land that was formerly King Henry VIII's hunting grounds (hence 'Crown Woods'). As well as pupils from Eltham, the school also attracts pupils from nearby towns Welling and Sidcup. First known as Crown Woods School, the school was founded in 1958. It was reopened in new £50 million buildings designed by Nicholas Hare Architects in 2011 and was renamed Crown Woods College. In 2014 the school was renamed Stationers' Crown Woods Academy after the school gained academy status and joined the Leigh Academies Trust, the first Leigh academy outside Kent. The school also featured in BBC series Tough Young Teachers as two trainee teachers went to the school to learn on the job. History At one point Crown Woods was the largest comprehensive school in London with 2600 pupils. Between 1964 and 1985 or later the school had a boarding section for 120 children, mainly of serving Forces personnel, called The Lodge. In 2000, Crown Woods was identified by Ofsted as a \\"failing school\\". The school was critical of the cursory inspections Ofsted had made to come to this judgement, and challenged it in court. In a humiliating 11th-hour climbdown, Ofsted agreed to an out-of-court settlement which spared it the embarrassment of a public hearing. But in a humiliating 11th-hour climbdown, the office for standards in education agreed to an out-of-court settlement with the school, which spared it the embarrassment of a public hearing. Ofsted was ordered to pay the school's costs - estimated to run into five figures - as well as lifting its judgment. The chief inspector Chris Woodhead retired. Structure It is structured into four 'home schools', each in separate buildings. The scheme received a RIBA London Award in 2012 and was commended at the Civic Trust Awards the same year. Three of the schools are for pupils aged 11 to 16 and pupils are allocated to the schools based on ability, skills and interests. The fourth school is a dedicated sixth form centre for 16- to 18-year-old students. Previously a community school governed by Greenwich London Borough Council, Crown Woods College converted to academy status on 1 September 2014 and was renamed Stationers' Crown Woods Academy. The school is part of the Leigh Academies Trust and is sponsored by the Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers. Curriculum Stationers' Crown Woods Academy offers GCSEs, BTECs and vocational courses as programmes of study for pupils, while students in the sixth form have the option of studying from a range of A Levels as well as further BTECs, GNVQs, and other vocational courses.

The stadium in 1998, viewed from the north stand Prior to the stadium expansion, the Sportpark had a capacity of 11,000. The current main stand on the west side of the ground (Haupttribüne, formerly the Westtribüne), with its alpine-style roof, and large parts of the south stand (Südtribüne) were already established, although the current north stand (Nordtribüne) was made up of a few concrete steps and the east stand (Osttribüne) was a grass mound. Promotion to the Bundesliga in 1999 necessitated improvements in safety, security and capacity, resulting in the current maximum of 15,053. During first construction phase, prior to season 1999/2000, the capacity of the Nordtribüne – which contains the area for visiting supporters – was significantly increased. In addition, a small standing curve was created in the north-east corner of the stadium. During season 1999/2000, the Nordtribüne was further expanded. After these modifications, the capacity was 10,300; this temporary reduction in capacity was the result of converting standing areas to seating in the Ostribüne. As a result of the stadium's architecture, development of the Südtribüne (where the clubhouse is situated) and the Haupttribüne (which had an existing roof) was uneconomic. In addition, a VIP house was already situated at the north-west end. Following the successful 1999/2000 season, a curve was constructed between the Südtribüne and Haupttribüne, the Osttribüne was further reinforced and a roof was added, and the Nordtribüne was raised. Following these modifications, the stadium could then fulfill the 15,000 minimum capacity stipulated by the German Football Association. Outside the stadium, the ground was leveled to create more parking spaces and the combined foot and bicycle lane, running from the stadium to Fasanenpark station, was upgraded. Additional artificial and grass pitches were laid as part of a move to improve training facilities. However, further ground improvements – such as increasing the capacity of the Südtribüne – were quickly shelved, following relegation from the top-flight.  Highlights  The first game to sell-out at the stadium was the game against VfB Stuttgart in season 1999/2000, attended by 10,300, which ended in a 2-0 victory. Later that season, there were derbies against city rivals 1860 München and FC Bayern. The games were originally planned to take place at the 69,000 capacity Olympic Stadium, until the then- sponsor Erich Lejeune made a compensatory payment, allowing the game to be played at home. In May 2000, Bayer 04 Leverkusen came to the Sportpark needing to win to clinch the Bundesliga championship on the final day of the season. Haching won the game 2-0, following an own-goal by Michael Ballack and a header by Markus Leitner. Leverkusen's defeat allowed local rivals FC Bayern to win the championship. Unterhaching had a good home record and defeated both city rivals in 2000/01, along with victories that season against Borussia Dortmund and Hamburger SV. 2008 saw the first international at the Sportpark, when the German women's national team defeated England 3-0 in front of 9,185 spectators. In 2010, the German U-21 team defeated Ukraine 2-1, with two goals from André Schürrle.  Characteristics  Despite the upgrade, the stadium still has several charming idiosyncrasies, for example the two-storey clubhouse behind the Südtribüne and the players' tunnel that also comes out of the south stand. The stadium also houses a restaurant and an adjoining beer garden. The south-east corner of the ground has parking for the opponent's team bus.  Transport  = Public transport = From central Munich, take S-Bahn S3 to Fasanenpark (in the direction of Deisenhofen or Holzkirchen). The journey by foot is signposted and takes approximately 15 minutes. = By car = Coming from the south on the A8, exit at Neubiberg and follow the signs to the stadium.

The band consists of Kelsey Wilson (lead vocals and violin), Alexander Beggins (lead vocals and baritone ukulele), Sadie Wolfe (cello), Tyler Osmond (bass), Matt Bradshaw (keyboard and trumpet), Cody Ackors (guitar and trombone), and Tom Myers (drums). History = Beginnings (2010-2015) = Wilson and Beggins met while touring as back-up musicians for a Danish indie act called The Migrant. They began writing songs together in the backseat of the tour van and found they worked very well as a songwriting team. Both had just been through the end of relationships, which provided both common ground and writing material. Beggins had brought a ukulele from his father's instrument collection simply because it was small enough to comfortably pass around in a van (Beggins played accordion with The Migrant). By the end of the tour the two had written several songs and began recording their first album upon their return to Austin. To complete the sound they were seeking, they called in other local musicians and friends to help record, which eventually became the full Wild Child band. Their self-recorded first album, the 15-track Pillow Talk, was released on October 25, 2011 (with help from San Francisco producers Evan Magers and Alex Peterson, and mastered by Erik Wofford). The album was received positively on many blogs and yielded a number one single on the music promotion site The Hype Machine. Their second album, The Runaround, was released on October 8, 2013 via The Noise Company and produced by Ben Kweller. Kweller liked the band's debut album and sought out the band seeking to produce their sophomore effort. The album was funded in part through a successful Kickstarter campaign which raised over $40,000. It was recorded in January 2013. The first single from the album, \\"Crazy Bird\\", was received extremely positively, reaching number one on the music promotion site The Hype Machine, debuting number one the FMBQ SubModern/Specialty charts, and being featured on World Cafe. Reviews for the album were positive, including a rating of 8/10 from PopMatters. The song \\"Living Tree\\" was named in the 'Top Ten Songs of 2013' by NPR. =With Dualtone Records (2015-present)= The band began recording their third album, Fools, in the fall of 2014 in Savannah, Georgia. The remainder of the tracking was finished in late December 2014. When the band returned to Austin they enlisted Atlantic Recording Artist Max Frost to produce the track \\"Break Bones\\", and local producer Chris \\"Frenchie\\" Smith to mix the album. The band signed with Dualtone Records in April 2015 after A&R; Will McDonald caught the band's set at South by Southwest the month before. Fools was released October 2, 2015 worldwide via Dualtone Records and via Dine Alone Records in Canada. The album was met with strong critical reception, praised by most critics as a \\"step out\\" for the band as they continued to grow their sound and toy with more pop arrangements. Fools reached #18 on the Americana/Folk chart and #14 on the Heatseakers chart. Wild Child performing at the Lagunitas Brewing Company in Petaluma, California in July 2018.

Since 1931, with a change to the boundaries of Worcestershire, only three counties have met at the stone. Boundary marker The Four Shire Stone is not a single stone, but a nine-foot high monument, built from the local Cotswold stone. It is in the English midlands at the northern corner of a T junction on the A44 road, a mile and a half east of the small town of Moreton-in-Marsh, at , grid reference SP2301432023.

Most of Worcestershire is to the north-west of the stone. Thus the order of the four counties around the stone was different from what one might expect from a map of England. The stone ceased to be the meeting-point of four shires in 1931, when Evenlode was transferred to Gloucestershire, so since that date only three counties meet at the stone. The J. R. R.

It provides audio branding, music on hold and on-hold marketing to more than 36,000 clients in 39 countries worldwide, including Coca-Cola, Adidas and Audi. Founded in 1998 as PleaseHoldUK in Chester, England, the company experienced rapid growth in its early years, reaching 250 clients and moving to Manchester in 2000. In 2008, the company rebranded to become PH Media Group. In 2014, the company was named by Investec in their Mid-Market 100 list - as Please Hold (UK) - ranking it as one of the 100 fastest-growing private companies in the UK and recognising it as the world's largest audio branding agency. Continued growth saw the company move up the Investec Mid-Market 100 list in 2015, from 48th position to 35th. PHMG was also named on the 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 lists of ‘1000 Companies to Inspire Britain’ by London Stock Exchange, which aims to recognise some of the fastest-growing and most dynamic businesses in the UK. The company was also included in the ‘FT 1000: Europe’s Fastest Growing Companies’ list in 2018, as well as being named on the 2017, 2018 and 2019 ‘Greater Manchester Ward Hadaway Fastest 50’ lists. In 2018, PHMG was named as one of 'Chicago’s Best and Brightest Companies to Work For’ and was ranked tenth in the 'Leadership and Culture at Work: The CMI/Glassdoor Top 20' list. In 2019, the organization was awarded a ‘Great Place to Work’ certification, as well as being named as part of the European Business Awards 'Ones to Watch' list. In February 2020 PHMG was named in the Sunday Times 100 Best Companies to Work For, ranking 49th in the list. The rebrand from PH Media Group to PHMG followed in September 2016 and was also accompanied by a change to the company's logo. Also in September 2016, the company opened a permanent office in Chicago. This Chicago base replaced PHMG's office in New York City as the organisation's North American headquarters, headed up by CEO - North America, Peter Evans. Dane Liska, Head of Creative at PHMG received a Grammy in 2010 for his roles as assistant engineer and assistant vocal engineer on Rihanna’s ‘Only Girl (In the World)’ and album ‘Loud’.. In October 2019, PHMG hired former ITV Technology Director, James Davison as Chief Technology Officer. . James will be responsible for driving forward the use of technology and evolving the company’s product offering through the latest applications as well as exploring the full potential of voice cloud technology.  Market research  PHMG has commissioned several studies to gauge perceptions among both consumers and business of music on hold and on-hold marketing. In November 2011, a survey was conducted among 2,000 UK consumers concerning phone calls made to businesses. Findings included: 70% of consumers are put on hold for more than 50% of their calls; 68% of consumers are put on hold for longer than one minute; 73% of consumers want to hear something other than beeps or silence while on hold; 72% of personal calls to businesses are made at home on a landline; 60% of consumers are in front of a computer while on hold. Research into the use of regional accents and dialect by UK businesses in their on-hold marketing found a 27% rise in the use of accents between January 2012 and January 2013. The research also looked into perceptions of accents. For example, it found the Scottish accent is perceived as trustworthy and reassuring while the Yorkshire accent, used by brands such as O2 (United Kingdom) in television and radio advertising, is seen as wise and honest. Another study, conducted among 3,630 UK companies in March 2013, looked into the amount of time customers spend on hold while making calls to business. The average hold time was 33.48 seconds. During this time spent on hold, 34% of businesses left callers listening to silence, 26% played music, 26% played beeps and 7% used on-hold marketing messages. In 2014, PHMG conducted a further study among 1,000 UK consumers to determine attitudes towards British businesses' call handling standards. It found just 23% of Brits are happy with the way their calls to business are handled, with satisfaction levels being particularly low among the older generations - just 12% of 55 to 64-year-olds claimed to be satisfied. Despite this, it also found 45% of UK consumers are happy to hold longer than a minute during calls to businesses and only 6% are not willing to wait at all. The study also discovered that Brits will not tolerate poor call handling standards, with 73% saying they would not do business with a company again if their first call was not handled satisfactorily. PHMG has also conducted similar research in the USA to discover how perceptions of call handling standards and audio branding compare with the UK. A study of 2,234 in 2015 discovered only 32% of Americans are happy with the way businesses answer their phone calls, with people in the South and the Northeast found to be most satisfied (33%), followed by the Midwest (32%) and the West (31%). There was also a gender split, while older people were found to be more dissatisfied, with only 28% of 45- to 64-year- olds claiming to be happy with how their calls are handled, compared to 37% of 18- to 34-year-olds. The study also found Americans are more patient than the British. More than half (55%) of those surveyed said they were prepared to wait on hold longer than one minute during calls to companies, compared to 45% of Brits. American women are more patient than men - with 60% willing to remain on the line for longer than a minute, compared to 49% of men - and people also became more patient with age - 59% of 45- to 64-year-olds will wait longer than 60 seconds but the figure is only 50% for 18- to 34-year- olds. Americans were also found to be more tolerant of poor call handling practice than their British counterparts, with 59% saying they would never do business with a company if their first call was not handled properly. However, older customers were found to be least tolerant with 63% in the 55 to 64-year- old group claiming an unsatisfactory phone experience would stop them buying again, compared to 54% of 18 to 24-year-olds. In 2018, PHMG published the first findings of its research concerning the use of music in marketing. The study, conducted among 1,000 UK consumers, revealed music can be more effective than visuals in shaping perceptions of a company’s brand with 60% of respondents deeming music more memorable when used in marketing. The same research in the USA, conducted among 1,000 consumers, found 67% believe music is more memorable when used in marketing while in Australia, 66% of 1,000 respondents considered it more memorable. PHMG’s study also discovered younger people place more value on music as a key element of marketing than older generations, with 51% of Brits aged 18 to 24 saying music helps them feel more connected to a brand compared to just 27% of those 55 and over. In the US, 58% of 18 to 34-year-olds thought the same (compared to 41% of 55s and over) while 75% of Australians aged 18 to 24 feel more connected to a brand when they hear music (compared to 41% of 55s and over).  PHMG Foundation  Aside from its business operations, PHMG also runs a charity called the PHMG Foundation that aims to raise money for selected causes in the main territories where the company operates - the United Kingdom, the USA and Canada. The foundation was launched in 2013, supporting causes such as the British Heart Foundation and the NSPCC, and during its first six years raised more than £500,000 for almost 50 charitable organisations.

The first floor had paired rooms on either side of the hall; the second floor hall had six rooms on either side. The hotel was originally located near the beach, facing south, toward the Mississippi Sound.Ellis, J.B. and J.B. Shambra. 2009. Images of America—Biloxi. Arcadia Publishing, Charleston, SC Retrieved 2013-08-11 John Hahn died in 1848, but his wife operated the hotel to accommodate guests from New Orleans, because Biloxi had become a popular resort destination on the Gulf Coast. After the American Civil War, the hotel became a destination for winter guests from northern states, who were attracted by the mild climate. The hotel was operated by descendants of John Hahn through World War II, when it closed. In 1969, Hurricane Camille inflicted considerable damage to the building. Because of the hotel's historical significance, the city of Biloxi acquired the building in 1972, and moved it to a higher elevation, approximately north of its original location. The structure was oriented to face east and was restored.

It was part of Jan III Sobieski’s autumn expedition, aimed at destruction of mounted Tatar units, which plundered southeastern provinces of the Kingdom of Poland. In early October 1676, Hetman Jan Sobieski was stationed in Krasnystaw. On 5 October after finding out that several Tatar units were plundering the area of Zamosc, he decided to destroy them. The main Tatar forces camped near Krasnobrod, and in the night of October 5/6, Sobieski began a 52-kilometer march, which took place in a heavy rain. Early in the morning, Tatar camp was attacked by pro-Polish Cossacks, loyal to Mykhailo Khanenko. When news of the skirmish reached Sobieski, he decided to intervene, arriving at the site of the battle after 30 minutes. Polish forces joined the fighting, while Khanenko himself left Krasnobrod and headed to Zamosc. Several Tatar units were destroyed, and some 2,500 Polish civilians were captured by the invaders.

He is the founder and former president of the Institute for Humanist Studies, a founder of the Secular Coalition for America, and has been involved in numerous other humanist organizations.  Biography  Jones received his undergraduate degree from Middlebury College and attended graduate school at Villanova University and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. For many years Jones worked as a research chemist for the Research and Development division of General Electric. Although he was born into an atheist family, Jones did not discover humanism until the mid 1980s, when he became involved in the Capital District Humanist Society, a local humanist group in Albany, and the Council for Secular Humanism. Jones later served on the CDHS board and as director from 1998 to 2002. In 1999 Jones founded the Institute for Humanist Studies, a humanist think-tank based in Albany, NY, in order to promote a greater understanding of humanist values. The IHS grant program has also provided hundreds of thousands of dollars in grant funding to humanist projects. Both the Secular Student Alliance and Camp Quest were organizations that benefitted from these grants. August Brunsman, executive director of the Secular Student Alliance, states that Jones was “essentially one of the first donors to significantly support the SSA,” and that the IHS grant was vital to the survival of the organization. Funding from the IHS also helped Camp Quest grow and become more professionalized. Jones has been a board member of the National Philanthropic Trust, the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, Troy Music Hall, National Securities Corporation, and the Center for Inquiry. Prior to the creation of the Secular Coalition for America in late 2002, Jones represented the Institute for Humanist Studies in the Coalition for the Community of Reason.  Awards and achievements  In 2004, the Humanists of Florida Association named Jones “Humanist of the Year.” After spending several years on its executive committee, in 2006, Jones became the first vice-president of the International Humanist and Ethical Union, the worldwide umbrella group for humanist, atheist, rationalist, freethought, and ethical culture groups. He also represented the IHEU as a non-governmental organization delegate to the United Nations. In 2006, Jones received the Freethought Backbone Award in recognition of his commitment to the humanist movement and his role as founder and then-president of the Institute for Humanist Studies. The award was given by the Secular Student Alliance at an annual conference hosted by the Secular Student Alliance and Atheist Alliance International. In August 2013, Jones was honored by the Institute for Humanist Studies for his contributions to humanism.

Nestan-Darejan was a daughter of King Levan of Kakheti and a half-sister of Levan's successor to the throne of Kingdom of Kakheti, Alexander II. Her husband spent nearly five decades fighting the Safavid Iranian and Ottoman encroachments on his kingdom, twice losing his throne and personal freedom. Nestan-Darejan suffered further, being humiliated by his half-brother, the king of Kakheti, who capitalized on Simon's difficulties to attack and loot Kartli. After Simon had been sent a prisoner to Iran in 1569, Nestan-Darejan's estates had been pillaged by Prince Bardzim Amilakhori, Alexander's father-in-law; and in 1580, following Simon's return to Kartli and his defeat by Alexander at Dighomi, the latter carried off after the battle his half-sister's drawers on the point of a lance. Nestan-Darejan outlived her husband and died sometime after 1612, having mothered six children, including Simon's successor to the throne of Kartli, George X.  Marriage  Nestan-Darejan was born of Levan of Kakheti's second marriage to a daughter of the shamkhal of Tarki, whom the king married in 1529 after he divorced his first wife, Tinatin Gurieli. Nestan-Darejan married Simon I of Kartli in 1559. This union was one of the first interdynastic marriages between the Kartlian and Kakhetian branches of the Bagrationi dynasty, holding sway over the two breakaway successors of the once united Kingdom of Georgia. The union was followed by a pact between the two monarchies, one aim being to evict the Iranian garrison from Tbilisi, the capital of Kartli. Levan of Kakheti eventually hung back, but allowed his son and heir, Prince Giorgi, to join Simon's army. The Georgians lost the ensuing confrontation and Giorgi was killed on the battlefield.  Persecution  After the Iranian army captured Simon in battle and sent for imprisonment at Alamut in 1569, Queen Nestan-Darejan found herself in a hostile environment in Kartli. Main threats to her security came from her half-brother Alexander II, a disowned son of Levan, on whose death he succeeded as king of Kakheti, having defeated and massacred his half-brothers. Out of favor with the Safavid protégé Daud-Khan—Simon's Islamized brother and a rival ruler at Tbilisi, who was married to Alexander's relative—the queen became a target of harassment by Prince Bardzim Amilakhori, Alexander II's father-in-law, who, joined by the duke of Ksani, raided and completely looted her estate.  Return to power  The invasion of the Ottoman army of the Georgian lands led by Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha and the quick collapse of Daud-Khan's regime in 1578 compelled the Iranian government to release Simon as the only ruler capable to mount resistance to the Ottoman advance. Back to his homeland, Simon had his domestic adversaries, including Prince Amilakhori, arrested. Amilakhori and the duke of Ksani pleaded for mercy and approached Nestan-Darejan, who persuaded her husband to issue amnesty for them, having reclaimed, in return, what has been lost to these noblemen and, further, Akhalgori and Mejuda from the duke and Kaspi and Karbi from Amilakhori.  Further misfortunes  Alexander of Kakheti's enmity to Simon remained undiminished owing to his hatred of his half-sister. In 1580 the Kakhetian army surprised Simon, staying without troops at Dighomi, and put him to flight. Alexander could not get at Simon, but he, the Georgian chronicle says, dishonored Nestan-Darejan and, \\"like a brigand\\", rode off bearing his half-sister's drawers high upon a lance. Simon vowed revenge and assaulted Alexander's army at Chotori, putting the Kakhetians to rout and Alexander to flight. After years of heavy fighting, Simon's turbulent reign ended in 1600, when he was captured by the Ottoman army and sent in prison to Constantinople. His son, George X, succeeded him. Nestan-Darejan outlived both her son, who died in 1606, and her husband, who died in captivity in 1611. His remains were brought by the Georgian merchant Diakvnishvili from Constantinople to Nestan-Darejan and interred at the cathedral of Mtskheta. Nestan-Darejan's subsequent life is obscure. She lived on to see the accession to the throne of her young grandson, Luarsab II, subsequently a Christian martyr and saint of the Georgian Orthodox Church, and died sometime after 1612.  Children  Simon and Nestan-Darejan had six children, four sons and two daughters: * Prince Giorgi (c. 1560 – 1606), King of Kartli as George X; * Prince Luarsab (fl. 1561–1589), taken as a hostage to Iran in 1582; * Prince Aleksandre (fl. 1561–1589); * Prince Vakhtang (fl. 1600), sometime governor of Akhaldaba and Dirbi. He had a son, Luarsab (died in 1650), adopted by King Rostom of Kartli in 1639; * Princess Elene (fl. 1583–1609), wife of Manuchar II Jaqeli, Atabag of Samtskhe; * Princess Fahrijan-Begum (fl. 1582), who married Shahzada Sultan Hamza Mirza (died in 1578 or 1586), son of Shah Tahmasp I or Mohammed Khodabanda.

In May 1805, Egyptians led by Makram forced the Ottomans to replace the Wāli Ahmad Khurshid Pasha with Muhammad Ali. Makram soon discovered that Muhammad Ali planned to rule Egypt himself. Makram objected to a foreign ruler. Muhammad Ali exiled Makram to Damietta on 9 August 1809, where he stayed for four years. Makram then moved to Tanta, where he died in 1822.

It was part of Jan III Sobieski’s autumn expedition, aimed at destruction of mounted Tatar units, which plundered southeastern provinces of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. After the Battle of Narol, Polish units rested for some time, and on 7 October set off towards Cieszanow and Lubaczow. The area was raided by strong Crimean Tatar units, which burned villages, and captured thousands of civilians. After destroying a smaller Tatar unit, the Poles found out that a large force under Azamet Gerej, the son of the Crimean khan, concentrated near the town of Niemirow. Sobieski decided to carry out a surprise attack. The battle itself was short. Tatar camp was attacked from both front and rear, and the battle soon turned into a rout, in which the invaders were massacred. Thousands of captured civilians were released, and Poles took rich booty. Among Polish officers who distinguished themselves in the battle were Andrzej Modrzejewski, the owner of Wielkie Oczy, and Mikolaj Hieronim Sieniawski, the owner of Oleszyce. In 1872, on the 200th anniversary of the battle, the population of the town founded a commemorative monument of Jesus Christ. Furthermore, in 1883, an obelisk was placed in Niemyrow’s market square, with the inscription that read: “Jan III Sobieski, at that time Marshall and Crown Hetman, while chasing Tatars plundering Ruthenian lands, destroyed on 7 October 1672 a large Tatar camp, freeing 12,000 szlachta and peasants, women and children. In memory of the vanquisher of islam, the town of Niemyrow placed this tablet on 12 September 1883”.

Career Christopher Anderson first gained recognition for his pictures in 1999 when he boarded a small wooden boat with Haitian refugees trying to sail to America. The boat, named the \\"Believe In God\\", sank in the Caribbean. In 2000 the images from that journey received the Robert Capa Gold Medal. Anderson's early work from conflict zones such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon and Israel/ Palestine earned international acclaim and awards such as two World Press Photo Awards and Magazine Photographer of the Year. In 2004, Anderson began traveling to Venezuela to document the country under the presidency of Hugo Chávez. The resulting book, Capitolio (RM 2009) was named one of the best photographic books of 2010 at the Kassels book Festival in Germany. In 2011, Anderson made Capitolio into an app for iPhone and iPad, the first photographic book to be made into an application for such devices. His current work crosses genres, from documentary to art to portraiture of celebrities (such as Lady Gaga) and fashion. Anderson was one of the early members of the VII Photo Agency that was formed by photographers James Nachtwey and Antonín Kratochvíl in 2001. He resigned from the agency in 2004 and joined Magnum Photos in 2005.

The architects designed the house with classic concept in modern architecture of merging interior and exterior spaces through glass expanses and seamless materials. Face brick was incorporated into the house since it is located on a knoll overlooking a development where this was the unifying material.

The explosion occurred at Launcher Shelter 204, McGuire AFB, Ocean County, New Jersey, approximately south-southeast of Trenton, New Jersey. Launcher Shelter 204 was one of fifty-four located at McGuire AFB, operated by the 46th Air Defense Missile Squadron. BOMARC Base No. 1 The BOMARC Base No. 1 site was within the \\"Range and Impact Area\\" at the Northeast corner of McGuire AFB. It was one of two BOMARC bases of the New York Air Defense Sector. It was the first operational BOMARC base and had both a \\"Missile Support Area\\" with a Squadron Operations Center and a \\"Launch Area\\" with 56 Mode II Launcher Shelters in 2 flights (e.g., 2 compressor buildings were available to simultaneously get 2 missiles to the \\"Standby\\" stage prior to \\"Fire-up\\".) The missile complex was an annex of McGuire Air Force Base to the west where the sector's SAGE Direction Center (DC-01) was the missile launch control center. Planning for the base began in 1955, and construction began January 1958, aiming to begin operations in January 1960. and it became operational on 1 September 1959 with 3 IM-99A missiles (24 by 1 January). In December 1959, Col. Robert E. Stuart was the base commander, the 46th Air Defense Missile Squadron (BOMARC) commander was Lt. Col. Ernest B.

They found five anomalous areas which could represent the buried launcher. From 1999-2000 the USGS sampled and tested the Kirkwood-Cohansey aquifer with shallow ground water and sediment for radionuclides.

It is best known for the role its founders played in opposing Byzantine Iconoclasm. The only remnants of the monastery complex is the perimeter wall (peribolos), which has a fortress-like appearance with its high walls and solid door. Above the entrance, there is a heavily damaged inscription on which only the date 1801 is legible. The historian Adolphe Hergès, in his Les monastères de Bithynie, indicates that the name Medikios may derive from the name for \\"cloverleaf\\" and that the church was referred to in more recent times by the people as \\"Pateron\\", that is, \\"Fathers\\". Tryphon E. Evangelides and W.M. Ramsay dated the monastery's construction to 810, but Hergès preferred a date around 780. This is now the accepted date.Talbot (1991), p. 1328Nesbitt & Oikonomides (1996), p. 103 The founder of the monastery was Nikephoros, who restored a ruined church dedicated to Saint Michael and built the monastery around it. Nikephotos served as its first abbot until his death and in 813. Nikephoros participated in the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, where he indicates the monastery full original name as \\"Saint Sergios of Medikion\\". After Nikephoros's death, his pupil Niketas became the abbot. Niketas was persecuted with the beginning of the second Iconoclasm under Leo V (r. 813–820). He died in 824, and is celebrated by the Orthodox Church as an iconodule Confessor of the Faith. Both Nikephoros and Niketas were buried at the narthex of the monastery's church of Saint Michael. The history of the monastery is only intermittently known thereafter. The monastery was given as a grant to Michael Psellos in the mid-11th century, by which time it was known as the \\"Monastery of the Holy Fathers\\", indicating a cult around the two founding hegoumenoi. The monastery disappears from literary sources thereafter. The monastery burned down in 1800, and was rebuilt in 1801, but was in a derelict condition during a visit by Frederick William Hasluck early in the 20th century. Hasluck described the katholikon as \\"magnificent\\", and wrote that it was ornamented with originally arched and black and white mosaics in the courtyard. Pancenko, who came here in 1910, drew the attention to the old icons and likened it to \\"a museum where Greek Church pictures are exhibited\\". Evangelides (1889) defined the church as a large rectangle and he added: \\"It has no roof and columns, it is almost like a large inn deserted by its owner...\\".

He is sometimes described as the \\"first British casualty\\" of the Great War. Early life and family Hadley was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.Henry Hadley in household of Henry Hadley, \\"England and Wales Census, 1871\\" His father, also Henry Hadley (1812–1874), had been a senior doctor in the British Army, serving as a surgeon with the 40th Foot and the Rifle Brigade, in Australia with the 11th Foot and 99th Foot, at the Castle Hospital at Balaklava in the Crimean War, before retiring in 1861 with the honorary rank of Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals.The London Gazette, 4 June 1861, p.2353 His mother, Alpha Clementia Dunn, was from Hobart, Tasmania.Family Notices, The Courier, Hobart, Tasmania, 3 December 1851 His paternal grandfather, also Henry Hadley (1762–1830), was the physician of Erasmus Darwin and married Darwin's illegitimate daughter Susannah Parker (1772–1856) in 1809.The Life of Erasmus Darwin, Charles Darwin, p.143 He was educated at Cheltenham College, attended the Royal Military Academy Woolwich,Henry Hadley, \\"England and Wales Census, 1881\\" and served as a lieutenant in the 1st West India Regiment from 1887 to 1890.The London Gazette, 29 April 1887, p.2383The London Gazette, 7 January 1890, p.95 He later became a teacher of languages. Death Hadley had been teaching in Berlin for three or four years, but decided to move to Paris following Germany's declarations of war against Russia on 1 August 1914 and then France on 3 August, and its ultimatum to Belgium, in the preceding days. At 1:25 pm local time on 3 August, Hadley and his English housekeeper, Elizabeth Pratley, caught a train to Cologne from Berlin's Friedrichstraße station, intending to change trains there. A conductor on the train became suspicious of his behaviour, and Hadley became involved in an altercation while the train was stopped at Gelsenkirchen station. It was later claimed that Hadley had spoken in several foreign languages, did not appear to know where he was travelling to, argued with a waiter in the dining car, and made gestures at German officers. After briefly returning to his seat, he was shot in the stomach while in the train's corridor by a Prussian military officer, Oberleutnant Nicolay. Hadley was taken by ambulance to the in Gelsenkirchen, and died there at 3:15 am local time on 5 August – just three hours after the UK declared war on Germany. He was buried in a pauper's grave in zone 11, division 9 of the Protestant cemetery at Gelsenkirchen, but the exact site of the burial is no longer known.\\"Erstes Weltkriegsopfer starb in Gelsenkirchen\\", Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, 12 August 2013 Elizabeth Pratley was interrogated as a potential spy, at a military prison in Münster, but was eventually released, without charge, to the in Münster, and finally allowed to return home in November 1914. She then informed the British government of Hadley's death, on 26 November 1914. Legacy The British government received a communiqué from the German government, via the then-neutral American embassy in Berlin, declaring that Lieutenant Nicolay insisted that he had acted in self-defence, saying that Hadley had appeared to be reaching for a weapon, and did not respond to the warning \\"hands up or I will shoot\\". A court martial cleared him of all blame and he was promoted to Captain within a few months of the incident. Nonetheless, the British government continued to regard the case as one of murder. They issued a statement, published in The Times on 17 April 1915, which quoted the German communiqué, and protested at the acquittal of Nicolay.\\"Murder of British Subject.

It is located in Jampur Tehsil, Rajanpur District. It has a population of around 50,000, and the main languages spoken are Saraiki and Balochi. Etymology Daajal town was established by a saint named Dawood, when he was passing through a mud dunes, he stayed there under the tree, in local Siraiki language it is called \\"JAAL\\". After that place become a small village and called as Doowd Jaal, Afterward when population was increasing, town name changed to Dawojal and finally Daajal. History During the rule of Langahs in 1452, Islam Khan a relation of Lodhi King of Delhi was in charge of the southern part of the Multan Province. Nahars overthrew the supremacy of Langah and the then Lodhi King of Delhi approved the act. Nahars annexed a greater part of Dera Ghazi Khan and charged upon the territory of Daajal and Harrand in the north. Their march was repelled by Miranis in 1482. Albeit the country around Harrand and Daajal inhabited by Gorchani and Lunds tribes was governed by Khan of Kalat Mir Noori Naseer Khan Baloch for 70 years after defeating Ahmed Shah Abdali in 1758. Khan of Kalat retained this tract of land until 1827. Besides the area around Daajal and Harrand the Baloch tribes of Koh-e-Suleman including Marris, Bugtis and Kethrans are said to have been under nominal subjugation of Khan of Kalat though Qaisranis and Buzdars served as personal body guards of Khan of Kalat , but the Khan could never extend his direct sway over these tribes i.e. Qaisranis, Buzdars, Lunds, Babbars, Khosas, Legharis, Gorchanis and Mazaris inhabiting the mountainous tract from north of south The country of Harrand and Daajal came under the control of Khan of Kalat Mir Naseer Khan Baloch after defeating Ahmed Shah Abdali in Kalat Balochistan in 1758. This tract remained under the Khanate up till 1827. In 1827, the Nawab of Bhawalpur occupied the country of Daajal and Harrand for Sikh and thus the rule of Khan of Kalat came to an end over this area. Kabul, the British Government in 1838, at Lahore, ratified the treaty of 1834 between the Shah and the Maharajah. By this treaty Shah Shuja renounced his claim to all jurisdiction over the province of Harrand Daajal, at that time still nomi- nally in the Kalat Khanate. Soon after Ranjit Singh's death in 1839. no one having been- found fit to fill the place of that astute ruler, the whole of this part of the country fell into a state of anarchy. The Kalat Sardars, instigated, it is said, by the Khan, raided Harrand Daajal in retaliation for the conduct of the Sikh Government, and in their endeavour to recover the stolen province, all became anarchy and confusion throughout the Dera Ghazi Khan district. The conquest of Sindh in 1843 and annexation of the Punjab in 1849 advanced our North- West Frontier across the Indus to the hills bordering Afghanistan and Kalat. In this connection one feature is distinctly noticeable. Prior to, the Tripartite Treaty of 1838 the district of Harrand Daajal — including the Gurchanis, Mazaris, and certain Harris — was claimed by the Khan of Kalat.  Administrative status  Previously Daajal was regarded as a Town Committee but after dissolution of power to the district government plan of President Pervez Musharraf. It was divided into different union councils and the town committee status was abolished. Irrigation system =Daajal Canal= The Daajal Canal is the main source of irrigation for the people of the area and for population of whole Rajanpur District. It is drained from the Taunsa Barrage of Indus river. It is an artificial watercourse in the country of Pakistan. Its center lies at a latitude of 29.5418000 and longitude of 70.3600000 and it has an elevation of 124 meters above sea level. = Rod Kohi = Major Rod Kohi areas traversed by hill torrents constitute nearly 65 percent of the total area of Pakistan and encompass entire Balochistan. Rod-Kohi or hill torrent cultivation is a unique system of agriculture being practiced in all the four provinces.people Living in Pachadh area store rod kohi water for the cultivation of crop. Every year in summer season rod kohi water effected the vast area of Daajal and pachad. Mostly people and animals lost their life. Govt. of Pakistan made small dam but due to the huge water all small dam were destroyed. Agriculture The land of Daajal is very fertile in regard to agriculture. Cotton, wheat are generally produced in Daajal. Different vegetables are also grown there. Mangoes and dates are common fruits grown in this region.  Harand Fort Raja Harnacus” and his son Lok Bhagat had constructed the Fort of Harrand on the style of Monojodero. That is the reason structure of Harrand Fort seems contemporaneous civilization of Monojodero. Muslim rulers from Muhammad Bin Qasim to Ahmed Shah Abdali had maintained their sovereignty at this area. When the Region of Harrand was being ruled by Nadir. This fort was a route passage for Afghan-Iranian Invaders to Multan and India. It is said that Alexander the Great passed through this area on his quest to conquer the world.

Notable things  =Daajal (cattle)= The Dajal are a draft type of cattle and are found mainly in the Daajal area in district Rajan Pur in Punjab Province. Their color is white or gray, deepening to almost black on the neck, shoulder and hump in mature males. The average weight at maturity of Daajal cattle is 500 kg for males and 390 kg for females. The Daaal breed is an offshoot of Bhagnari breed, having almost similar points. However, Daajal cattle are comparatively smaller in size and lighter in color. =Daajal Cattle Breeding Farm= Daajal Cattle Breeding Farm was established in 1985 on the state landing Rakh DhundhiFazilpur. The farm land was transferred to WPADC in February 1964 to operate it as seed farm. After a lapse of 8 years i.e. 1972, the WPADC was dissolved and the Punjab government again decided to establish a cattle breeding farm at Fazilpur to cope with the demands of Dera Ghazi Khan Division. Initially a livestock experiment station was established in 1972–73 for the breeding of Daajal cattle and Awassi sheep, but soon after the Daajal breed of cattle was replaced with Sahiwal under the direction of the provincial cabinet. Accordingly, the scheme was revised and implemented with effect from 1973-74 to breed pure Sahiwal for the objectives given in the next paragraphs. Buffalos found in Pakistan make up 47% of Pakistan's major dairy animal's population providing more than about 61% of the total milk produced in the country. Buffalo breeds found in Pakistan are Nili Ravi, Kundi and Aza Kheli. Nili Ravi is considered best buffalo breed in world and known as Black Gold of Pakistan. Cattle constitute about 53% of the national population of major dairy animals in Pakistan and contribute the share of almost 34.9% to the total milk production in country. The cattle breeds found in the country are Sahiwal, Cholistani, Red Sndhi, Achai, Bhagnari, Daajal, Dhanni, Gibrali, Kankraj, Lohani, Rojhan, and Thari. Out of these, Sahiwal, Cholistani, and Red Sindhi are main dairy breeds and well known internationally due to their distinct characteristics. Other than well-defined cattle breeds, there are a large number of nondescript cattle breeds and crossbred cattle. Sahiwal and Cholistani are the two main dairy breeds of cattle. Their average milk production per lactation is about 1200–1800 liters with 4.5% butter fat. The age at first calving is more than 3.5 years and calving interval ranges between 1.5 and 2 years. Dhanni, Daajal and Rojhan are draught type breeds with milk production potential of 800-1000 liters per lactation. Utility of these draught breeds has declined over the years due to increased mechanization in agriculture. The production recording and progeny testing program is being executed in Sahiwal breed only and is limited to institutional herds. * Khir paray: A product made from milk. * Mud Pots Gharay (water store pot) and Danwray are very famous. =Four Sufi Sultans= Daajal is also the place of four Sufi sultans and saints named Abharng Sultan, Sanghi Sultan and Ganwar Sultan.

As an Academic Clerk at Magdalen his duties included services with the esteemed organist John Varley Roberts. Foxton Ferguson's talent for solo singing became apparent in his college years at which time he appeared with the \\"Magdalen Vagabonds\\". Henry Bramley, Dean of Divinity)(Foxton Ferguson is fourth from the left in the back row and Roberts is fourth from the right in the middle row with Bramley to his left) Ferguson's post-university musical studies took him to London and then Leipzig, though he was not enrolled at the Königliches Konservatorium der Musik zu Leipzig. Later he studied with the famous German baritone Julius Stockhausen who had founded his own school of singing in 1880. Stockhausen's diverse repertoire included opera, oratorio and, most of all, German Lieder. Foxton Ferguson's own repertoire was of a similar breadth and scope. While he sang bass in ensembles he was called a baritone when singing as a soloist. His concert repertoire included an abundance of Lieder by Schubert and Schumann as well as folk song arrangements and original compositions by contemporary English composers. In opera Foxton Ferguson performed in such diverse repertoire as Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro and Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg though opera didn't play as large a role in his career as concerts did. Career Ferguson is most known for his English translations of German texts including Ottfried's Schubert Fantasies (1914); three 1903 duets based on German folk songs by Ralph Vaughan Williams, \\"Adieu\\", \\"Think of Me\\", and \\"Cousin Michael\\"; and Charles Macpherson's \\"The Shepherds' Cradle Song\\" (1912) based on \\"Der Hirten Wiegenlied\\" of Karl Neuner (1814). Arthur Foxton Ferguson in costume with unknown woman c. 1910 Ferguson collaborated regularly with Lucy Broadwood, Ernest Walker, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Sir Henry Walford Davies. Working with Broadwood and the English Folk Dance and Song Society, of which he was a decade long member, Foxton Ferguson collected folk songs from 1905 to 1909 including \\"May Day Carol\\" (second version) from Southill, Bedfordshire which he noted from the singing of Mr Charles Baldock in 1905. The tune \\"Southill\\" was included in Vaughan Williams' 1906 edition of The English Hymnal and also Songs of Praise but without acknowledgement. He had known Broadwood as early as 1899 when he sang in a solo quartet with her at Cambridge through the University Musical Society. In 1904 she had him perform on the third series of the Broadwood family's \\"Ladies Concerts\\" in the Midland Theater with his then regular recital partner the soprano Beatrice Spencer (1877–1961). In 1903, Foxton Ferguson sang the premieres of three duets based on German folk songs and arranged by Vaughan Williams (see above) which the singer himself had translated. In recital he also sang the composer's songs \\"Blackmwore by the Stour\\" and \\"Boy Johnny,\\" the latter dedicated to the baritone James Campbell McInnes (1874–1945). The premiere of the Vaughan William's Two Vocal Duets (\\"The Last Invocation\\" and \\"The Bird's Love Song\\") in 1904, which were the composers' first settings of Walt Whitman, were sung by Foxton Ferguson and Beatrice Spencer who had also sung the premieres of two of the German duets together. Foxton Ferguson sang with the pioneering conductor Gwynne Kimpton on her \\"Concerts for the Young\\" in the years preceding the Great War performing in Duke's Hall, Royal Academy of Music and Steinway Hall where he sang \\"Mother Goose's Rhymes.\\" On the evening of 28 March 1914, Ferguson gave a song recital under the auspices of The Institute of Arts and Sciences of Columbia University. The Folk-Song Quartet The Folk-Song Quartet was Foxton Ferguson's invention and was composed of Beatrice Spencer, soprano, Florence Christie, mezzo-soprano, Louis Godfrey, tenor, and Foxton Ferguson as the bass. Singing repertoire from England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales the group was well-loved and performed extensively in England in the early part of the 20th century. In 1907, Daniel Mayer arranged a German tour for the group which started in Hamburg and toured to Berlin. The reception was warm and enthusiastic and Foxton Ferguson was disappointed that the tour couldn't be extended. Background: On 3 June 1901, the TWestern Daily Press reported that a vocal quartet had been formed in London by Foxton Ferguson with a two-fold purpose; firstly, to have a well-practiced solo quartet ready for performances of the Choral Symphony, and secondly to study the large and ever increasing body of quartet repertoire. The members of this ensemble, which was singing together as early as 1900 on Ernest Walker's Balliol Sunday concert series, were the well-known Austrian soprano Miss Marie Fillunger, Miss Evelyn Downes, mezzo-soprano, Mr Seth Hughes, tenor, and Foxton Ferguson. One Year prior, a Foxton Ferguson concert in Steinway Hall featured a different quartet composed of Miss Fillunger, Miss Florence Shaw, Mr Walter Ford and Foxton Ferguson with Ernest Walker as accompanist. By December 1900, Florence Christie had become the mezzo-soprano of the quartet, which the public regarded as Miss Fillunger's quartet and, in 1903, a fatal chamber concert at Bechstein Hall sealed any hopes of the Wagnerian Cicely Gleeson-White taking over the soprano role. By 1904, Foxton Ferguson's group was billing itself regularly as the \\"Folk-Song Quartet\\" (it was sometimes also called \\"The Foxton Ferguson Vocal Quartet\\" and The \\"Folk-Singers\\" Quartet) and his longtime duet partner Beatrice Spencer had assumed the soprano role solidifying a stable and permanent ensemble for the next fifteen years. Lectures and teaching Known for his wit, exuberance, and pithiness onstage, Foxton Ferguson was an expert lecturer on English folk song and gave presentations (where he both spoke and sang) in England, Germany, and on extensive tours of the United States in the years 1909–1914. Often appearing through colleges, libraries, and women's clubs, he lectured at Harvard University, The Mendelssohn Hall in New York, The Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, The Harvard Club, The Waldorf- Astoria, Philadelphia, PA, The University of Minnesota, Newton, MA, Kansas City, MO, Portland, OR, Fort Worth and Dallas, TX. His lecture topics ranged from folk lore and folk songs to Christmas carols and songs of the sea. Once at a high school in Dallas, Texas, in March 1913, Ferguson gave a two-hour lecture (both singing and speaking) on \\"Vagabondia, or Songs of the Open Road.\\" In that lecture he said the following, \\"Vagabondage does not mean to me simply long hair and filth. It means being one's self. Every true vagabond is himself. It is of the greatest importance to be one's self.\\" On the same trip, under the auspices of the Standard Club of Dallas, he lectured to an audience of two-hundred repeating over and over, \\"These songs are not England's any more than they are yours.\\" In 1904, Ferguson provided pre-opera lectures for Charles Manners' (1857–1938) Moody-Manners touring company (the larger) for its performances at Theater Royal, Drury Lane lecturing on Charles Gounod's Faust and Fromental Halévy's La Juive, and Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde and Lohengrin. Around the outbreak of World War I, Foxton Ferguson became a Master at Eton College where he was beloved by his students through the last years of his life. An obituary in the Eton College Chronicle of 5 November 1920 reads, \\"His face was irresistibly humorous; you could not see him without feeling a keen interest in him. His singing (how often and how gladly we have heard him sing) was a constant joy, and abides, thought we shall never hear him sing again, a joy forever. ... you could not meet him without feeling some influence for good: always he lived in harmony with the best and in peace with all. ... to love others first, with or without return, is what matters most; ... he came to us already knowing it, it was in this spirit that he lived and died.\\" Publications In addition to his English translations he contributed to several music periodicals including The Academy & Literature, and The Girl's Own Paper. In the latter in October 1903, he contributed a \\"Schubert Fantasy\\" and from 1903 to 1904 as series of articles entitled \\"Music as a Profession for Girls.\\" Foxton Ferguson is also thanked by his friend the American architect Alfred Hopkins for being a good friend and a reader in the preface of his 1920 book Modern Farm Buildings. Family Foxton Ferguson's younger brother Rev. William Harold Ferguson (1874–1950) was also a composer, clergyman, and hymnbook editor. He followed in his brother's footsteps first as a chorister at Magdalen College and then as a student at Das Königliche Konservatorium der Musik zu Leipzig. On 19 January 1906, he accompanied a duo recital for Beatrice Spencer and Foxton Feguson in Alexandra Hall on Cookridge St. in Leeds. Death Foxton Ferguson died unexpectedly of a duodenal ulcer while singing a concert on 2 November 1920 (The Cottage Hospital Littleham, Exmouth, Devonshire).

(p. 1.13 of Boeing's IM-99A Bases Manual) Planned in 1955 for completion in February 1960 and activated as the 2nd operational BOMARC complex on 1 December 1959 (4 missiles by 1 January), the annex was part of the New York Air Defense Sector defenses. The annex included a Launch Area with 56 Mode II Launcher Shelters in 2 flights (e.g., 2 compressor buildings were available to simultaneously get 2 missiles to the \\"Standby\\" stage prior to \\"Fire-up\\".) Missile Support Area The Missile Support Area included offices of the Base Commander (Col Fred G. Hook, Jr. in 1959), an OOAMA representative, and the Commander of the 6th Air Defense Missile Squadron; while Boeing Airplane Company support was from an office north in Riverhead, New York. Military police operated from a Security Control and Identification building at the SSW entrance to the annex from Old Country Road. Two flights of missile maintenance airmen used the Assembly and Maintenance (A & M) Shop for preparing newly received missiles, repairing BOMARCs that malfunctioned, and periodic recycling. \\"Missile Recycle\\" for 6 mo/2 yr component replacement from \\"ready-storage\\" used 5 A & M Shop stations after the missile had been transported to the Main Shop Room following defueling and warhead removal at the Launcher Shelter and decontamination at the Fuel Facility.

The console controlled missile warm-up (e.g., 2 minutes for IM-99A rocket fuel while 30 seconds was needed for IM-99B: arming of the igniter & activation of gyros, seeker, fuze, etc.) and to maintain the BOMARC at \\"Standby\\" (warmed-up & erected) until \\"Fire-up\\" by a remote Senior Director's keyed console (fire button) at the launch control center (Weapons Director room) at McGuire DC-01, which also was the launch control center for the missile complex on Fort Dix. The console then displayed whether the missile transitioned to the \\"Launch\\" or \\"Malfunction\\" stage, which determined the subsequent squadron operation needed at the Launcher Shelter (checkout of the empty shelter or deactivation of the faulty missile). Civilian use In 2009 the former missile launch complex was being used as a county impound lot and county/FBI shooting range.

He completed a master of divinity degree at Virginia Theological Seminary in 1974 and was ordained as a priest in 1975. VonRosenberg served as canon to the ordinary (assistant to the bishop) of the Episcopal Diocese of Upper South Carolina from 1989 to 1994. Afterwards, he became rector of St. James Episcopal Church in Wilmington, North Carolina. On February 27, 1999, vonRosenberg was consecrated as the third bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of East Tennessee, a diocese covering 34 counties in Tennessee and three in North Georgia, with 45 congregations and five worshiping communities and nearly 16,000 active members. He retired from that position in June 2011. On January 26, 2013, he was elected as bishop provisional of the Episcopal Church in South Carolina, a diocese of ECUSA which was challenged with reorganization in the wake of Bishop Mark Lawrence's departure from the Episcopal Church. VonRosenberg referred to the departing followers of Lawrence as \\"sincere Christians\\". In describing his own task as the new bishop, vonRosenberg said \\"I want to use the image of rebuilding, for that is what we are called to do – to reorganize and to rebuild the Episcopal Church in South Carolina.\\" He went on to say that the diocese should rebuild the church on the foundation of Jesus Christ, with an attitude of humility and love. He has since filed a false-advertising lawsuit against Lawrence that claims he is falsely representing himself as a bishop of the Episcopal Church. The case is ongoing. On January 14, 2016 VonRosenberg announced his intention to retire as bishop provisional after June 26 when he completes his schedule of visits to the congregations and missions of the diocese.

(born May 11, 1953 in the United States) is a yogic monk, activist, writer and the founder of the Prout Research Institute of Venezuela. Since becoming a monk, in the socio-spiritual organisation and movement Ananda Marga, Dada Maheshvarananda has dedicated his life to traveling and living around the world teaching meditation, yoga and spreading the Progressive Utilization Theory (PROUT). Maheshvarananda's first book is titled After Capitalism: Prout's Vision for a New World (2003); prefaced by Noam Chomsky, it has been translated into 10 languages.

He began practicing meditation in 1974, as taught by the Ananda Marga yogic sect, and studying the prolific writings and books of its founder Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar. In 1976 he assumed a monastic lifestyle with Ananda Marga and met Sarkar in India 2 years later. This first meeting, he writes \\"inspired me to become a monk, and to dedicate my life to the service of humanity.\\"ibid In 1983, Sarkar initiated him into the order of avadhuta, a monk or nun of an order close to the tradition of Shaeva Tantra. =Southeast Asia= From 1979 to 1991 Maheshvarananda taught meditation and yoga to hundreds of people and supervised various social service projects in Indonesia and the Philippines (also known as \\"Maharlika\\"). He also helped organize relief operations with the international service organization, AMURT (Ananda Marga Universal Relief Team).\\"Go with the Flow \\" (1985) =Brazil= From 1992 to 2003 Maheshvarananda worked in Brazil, where he participated in Eco-92 and the World Social Forum and formed relationships with leaders of Liberation Theology and other popular social movements, such as Leonardo Boff, Frei Betto, Herbert de Souza, Carlos Minc and .

Four years later Maheshvarananda and José Albarrán founded the Prout Research Institute of Venezuela in Caracas, an independent, not-for-profit foundation. Its stated mission is \\"to empower all people to improve their quality of life within a more just society by fostering and promoting worker cooperatives, self-reliant communities, environmental protection, universal ethics, and spiritual values.\\" The institute accepts international visitors and volunteers at the “Quinta Prout” in El Marques, Caracas who learn, research and implement PROUT principles. The institute supports Centro Madre (Mother's Center), founded in 2000 by Ananda Marga nun Didi Ananda Sadhana, which fosters self-sufficiency through education, co-op development, and sustainable agriculture on its 8.6 acres of agricultural land. The center has been repeatedly recognized by the rural development agency of the Bolivarian government of Venezuela as a national model.

It debrands the traditional Coke logo, replacing \\"Coca-Cola\\" from one side of a bottle with the phrase \\"Share a Coke with\\" followed by a person's name. The campaign, which uses a list containing 250 of the country's most popular names (generic nicknames and titles are also used in some cases), aims to have people go out and find a bottle with their name on it, then share it with their friends. The campaign began in Australia in 2011. Campaign effectiveness and outcomes The Share a Coke campaign was subsequently rolled out in over 80 countries. In Australia, the advertising agency Ogilvy estimated that the campaign increased Coke's share of the category by 4% and increased consumption by young adults by 7%. The campaign received multiple awards at the Creative Effectiveness Lion Awards at Cannes. In the United States, where the campaign is credited with increasing sales by more than 2% reversing more than 10 years of decline in Coke consumption, the company and its agency has sought ways to extend the campaign while maintaining its relevance. In 2015, the company extended the campaign by increasing the number of names to 1,000. Nicknames such as \\"bro\\", \\"better half\\" and \\"sidekick\\" were also added to the inventory of names. In 2016, the company replaced people's names with lyrics from 70 popular songs including Lean on Me and We are the Champions. In 2017, the campaign returned to the US with a new variant; holiday destinations. Bottles of coke are labelled with favourite summer holiday spots such as Hawaii, Ibiza, Barbados etc. Additionally, Coca-Cola collaborated with McCann and Score a Score to create over 1000 unique songs based on names found on bottles of Coke. Financial analysts and advertising experts have used the success of the 'Share-a-Coke' campaign to remind marketers and advertisers of the need to personalise the communications message.

She must have been approximately 27-years-old when she moved to Geneva, Switzerland, with her mother and sisters. Soon after she arrived in Geneva she decided to return to The Hague to negotiate a stipend she was entitled to with her uncle Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, and to request her inheritance from her aunt, Maria of Nassau, the Countess of Hohenlohe. She negotiated a deal with her uncle and soon afterwards she returned to Geneva. Her mother died soon after Maria Belgica returned to her. Maria Belgica married a colonel, Baron Croll, who originally came from Heidelberg, Germany, but had come to Geneva in the service of the Margrave of Baden-Durlach. The match was deemed unworthy of her, and her husband was seen as an opportunist. Croll was later given the title of Baron of Prangrins. The marriage was not a happy one, and a divorce was first approved and later rescinded by the government of Bern. Croll, however, was murdered in 1640 in Venice before any further decisions had been made. Maria Belgica died in Geneva in 1647. She was buried in the same chapel as her mother.

By order of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht dated 14 Oct 1942, it was part of the combat arms of the German Wehrmacht and Waffen SS until 1945. The colour allocated by the Wehrmacht and Waffen SS in 1935 to their signal corps was lemon yellow. By contrast, the corps colour of the air force signal troops of the Luftwaffe was brown.  Background: First World War and Reichswehr  Signals detachment with light army field vehicle during the First World War The precursor of the German Signal Corps was the Telegraph Corps formed in 1899 as a separate arm of service. Telegraph battalions, fortress and army signal units were not combined into the Signal Corps, the Nachrichtentruppe, until 1917, during the First World War.Imperial Decree \\"Formation of the Signal Corps\\" dated 18 July 1917; see Hans-Georg Kampe: Military Communications in Germany, accessed on 20 May 2012 In addition to radio and telephone communications, the newly developed teleprinters, carrier pigeons and heliographs were used for messaging. During the First World War, radio telegraphy took on increasing importance. For example, in 1915 teleprinters were first used by the air force, for artillery observation. In 1916, the first signalmen equipped with mobile radios were operating on the front line. In the Reichswehr from 1921 each division had a communications unit with two companies. As well as radio and telephone communications, signal pigeons were also used for the transmission of information. From 1930, Enigma cypher machines were used for the first time to automatically encrypt secret information.  Signal Corps of the Wehrmacht  = Creation = Mobile radio station of the Mobiler Landfunkdienst on a signal vehicle (HF long-haul communications) (Funkenwagen (HF-Weitverkehr)) on exercise in summer 1935 During the rearming of the Wehrmacht the first top secret rearmament measures were carried out in spring 1933. These measures included the formation of new units and the establishment of a second signal company in existing units, the recruiting of officer cadets resulting in an eightfold increase over that on 1 April 1933, the reinforcing of the officer and NCO cadre by former signals soldiers, and their training through various courses.Hans-Georg Kampe: Das militärische Fernmeldewesen in Deutschland, retrieved 20 May 2012 From 1934, from the old signal units the required cadre of officers and soldiers was drawn for the establishment of new formations, the divisions of the Wehrmacht each receiving a signal unit. Meanwhile, the Signal Corps steadily expanded its field of expertise; they now had light, medium and heavy telephone troops, telephone exchange and telephone operating troops, telegraph construction troops, light and heavy radio troops, miniature radio troops, two-way radio troops, radio surveillance troops, patrol radio troops, cypher and evaluation troops and battery charging troops. From 1935, the training of the Signal Corps was carried out at the Army and Air Force Signal School (Heeres- und Luftnachrichtenschule) and, from 1936, the Army Signal School (Heeresnachrichtenschule) in Halle-Dölau. Two central bunker systems were built as communication centres in Zossen and in Ohrdruf. From a special-to-arm perspective the Corps was led by the Inspector of the Signal Corps (Inspekteur der Nachrichtentruppen) at the Oberkommando des Heeres, the individual formations and units were subordinated to their respective commanders in the field army. = Organisation and strength = At the start of the war the Signal Corps had: * 104 divisional signal units with a headquarters, telephone company, radio company and light supply column * 23 corps signal units with a telephone company, radio company, two telephone and radio companies and a light supply column * 10 signal regiments and 12 field signal commands at army and army group level with HQs, a 1st (Operating) Unit (I. Abteilung (Betrieb)) with a telephone and a radio company, as well as a 2nd and 3rd (Construction) Unit (II. und III. Abteilung (Bau)) each with an operating and three construction companies * 7 surveillance companies for communications surveillance * 45 independent truck cable construction, telephone operating and telephone construction companies; * 14 signal reserve units In addition, at unit level there were the signal troops of the combat forces like, for example, those in the artillery or chemical warfare units. They did not belong to the Corps of Signals, but were integrated into the formations and units and were subordinated to the commanders of their respective companies, batteries and squadrons. The propaganda forces were also part of the Corps of Signals until 1942, but then became an independent arm of service. As more large formations were created during the war, numerous new and reserve units were established including independent signal companies or special units, among them the wire construction companies, decimetre band (i.e. UHF) radio relay companies, carrier frequency companies, telephone exchange companies and telephone maintenance companies. = Deployment during the Second World War = Signalman with radio (transmitter and receiver), Russia, 1942 The Inspector and General of Signals Erich Fellgiebel, who was executed in 1944 for his part in the 20 July plot against Hitler, was credited with saying: \\"The Signal Corps have a tough time. You can't smell them, they don't make a noise, most people don't notice that they exist at all unless the communications stop working.\\"Hans-Georg Kampe: Das militärische Fernmeldewesen in Deutschland, retrieved 20 May 2012.  Postwar development  Both the lemon yellow corps colour and the name Nachrichtentruppe were retained by East Germany's army, the NVA, until 1990. On the other hand, the German Bundeswehr changed the name to Fernmeldetruppe, but kept lemon yellow as the corps colour.

Biography Seymour was born in Hartford, Connecticut in 1873. Her parents died while she was a teenager. Prior to her mother's death, she was adopted by the family of the American Civil War veteran and social activist Lloyd G. Seymour. In June 1888 she visited the City Hall to review her birth certificates and declared her official name as Mary Emma Townsend Seymour. In 1891, she married Frederick Seymour, a member of the Seymour family. Many African Americans at the time had migrated north from the southern United States. In Hartford, school officials considered segregating the schools. Seymour and her husband, along with 20 other local residents, began organizing for civil rights. On October 9, 1917, the Hartford chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was founded, with Seymour serving as its spokesperson. As part of her activities with the NAACP, she went undercover to investigate the treatment of women tobacco workers, and worked to publicize their plight. An account of Mary's undercover work was published in The Crisis in June 1920 under the title \\"A Woman's Work\\". In 1918, she helped form Hartford's equal rights advocacy chapter of the Circle for Negro War Relief, to help black soldiers' families during the war. Around the same time, she also joined the Colored Women’s League of Hartford. In 1919, when suffragists were working to have the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution passed prohibiting any United States citizen from being denied the right to vote on the basis of sex, Seymour campaigned to ensure that black women's right to vote would also be protected. Around 1920, Seymour joined the American Red Cross and worked with African American women tobacco packers. She and fellow activist Josephine Bennett interviewed female laborers, and co-wrote an exposé on the subject for the NAACP's The Crisis in 1920. In 1920, Seymour became the first African American woman to run for the Connecticut General Assembly. She did not win, but was the first African American woman to run for this position. She died in Hartford in 1957 and is buried in Hartford's Old North Cemetery. Her grave is a site on the Connecticut Freedom Trail. In 1997 Mary Seymour Place was opened in Hartford, to provide supportive housing for homeless women and children. She was inducted into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame in 2006.

He flourished between 1499 and 1524, and worked mainly for the Cathedral of Avila and convents of the same city, but also performed works in Ampudia, Cuéllar, Olmedo and Toledo. Early career Vasco de la Zarza may have been born in Ttoledo, although others have considered him of Portuguese origin. He is first mentioned in 1499, when he was charged with the size of the tabernacle altar of the Ávila Cathedral, which he completed in 1508. His work shows influences of Domenico Fancelli. He is believed to have taken a trip to Italy in his youth, which would have enabled contact with Italian Renaissance art, which is seen as an influence in his style. Works His most important work is the tomb with Alonso Fernandez de Madrigal (1518) made of alabaster. Alonso de Madrigal, a leading humanist, is represented in the act of writing on a lectern. At the base of the sculpture are represented virtues and over, on a large circular relief, the Adoration of the Magi. Above, on the frieze shows the cavalcade of the Magi and, topping the composition, the Nativity. In the four side panels, framed by richly ornate and simple cover, the four evangelists in the act of writing, there are over roundels with representations of saints and, above them, several scenes from the life of Christ. His latest work documented in Ávila in 1522, is the tabernacle of the main altar, carved in alabaster, with scenes of the Passion. He also attributed the tomb of Hernán Núñez de Arnalte, treasurer of the Catholic Monarchs, Santo Tomas de Avila and many other works in Ávila and other nearby locations. In the province of Segovia he completed tombs for Beltrán de la Cueva, 1st Duke of Alburquerque, his three wives and his brother, in the church of the monastery of San Francisco de Cuéllar. In the Toledo Cathedral in 1515 he carved the tombs of Alonso Carrillo de Albornoz and Inigo Lopez Carrillo de Mendoza, in the chapel of San Ildefonso. In the province of Valladolid with Alonso Berruguete he conducted in 1523 the altarpiece of the chapel of the monastery at Olmedo, Valladolid. References * Jose Camon Aznar.

Early life Agnes Deans Cameron was born in Victoria, British Columbia, the youngest child of Duncan and Jessie Cameron. Duncan Cameron was a successful Scots immigrant miner and contractor. She was an outstanding student at Victoria High School, a public school. While still a student she successfully wrote the provincial teachers' examinations.

Le Theatre de Neptune was performed in the harbor outside the French settlement of Port Royal on November 14, 1606. He published the play in 1609. The script attempts to prove the promise of New France. The play is a series of four welcoming speeches by Mi'kmaq chiefs. Each accepts the sovereignty of the French, unmistakably and unreservedly. These natives proclaim allegiance to the French monarch in their own territory, and that fact presses a question of the authenticity of the scripted representation.

De-corporatizing is when a company removes its name from its logo for a marketing campaign in an attempt to make themselves appear less corporate and more personal. \\"Transitioning into generic\\" is when a company with a well-known brand opts to appear more generic. This means the company will eliminate advertising and reduce prices and debranding in this sense can increase profit margins. History = De- corporatizing = This image shows the development of the first ever company to successfully debrand. Nike has been called the first company to debrand their logo, which happened in 1995. In 2011, this trend continued when Starbucks opted to remove its name from the logo leaving only the center image. The intention was to make Starbucks appear more like a local coffee shop and less corporate. Two years later, Coca-Cola debuted Share a Coke. This promotion saw Coca-Cola replace its logo with 150 given names. = Transitioning into generic = In the early 1980s American consumers began transitioning from so-called “name” brands towards more affordable generic, or “no-name,” brands. This shift occurred across a range of household products. In a short amount of time generic brands captured 2% of supermarket sales in the US. In 1981 generic brands commonly held 4–10% of the product category sales in which they were strongest, in some cases reaching as high as 16%. What puzzled many was that generic brands were capturing market share without the benefits of major distribution afforded to the name brands. This increase in market share of generic brands also came at a time when overall sales were decreasing slightly. With no signs of slowing, generic brands posed a significant threat to the profitability of major brands. Psychological reasons = De-corporatizing = The intention behind debranding is often to make the company appear less corporate and therefore more personal and “forward thinking”. = Transitioning into \\"generic\\" = Many large corporations assumed generics were a fad, targeted at the low-end, price- conscious consumer. Research proved quite the opposite. Consumer satisfaction for generics was very high; 93% of those who purchased generics were satisfied with the product and 86% were interested in continuing to purchase generics. Furthermore, evidence suggested consumers viewed the quality of generics to be at least as good as those of private brands. This presented a huge issue for branded products: consumers of all types, including the highly educated and upscale, were not necessarily concerned about the price of the product, but rather the perceived value. If a product is produced by Brand X, but there is a generic available, the consumer will tend toward the generic since the perceived quality is similar, but the price is generally lower. This means consumers were no longer responding to, or willing to pay for, the extensive branding and advertising campaigns contained in the price of the branded product. Brands with marginal or weak sales were at the highest risk of losing customers. Retailers, ever conscious of optimizing shelf space, depended on quarterly reports to review sales data and either reduce or remove weak or even marginal brands to make room for more profitable products. However, a new technology would revolutionize the way retailers collected this data: the universal product code (UPC). The UPC symbol, also known as a barcode, introduced a great deal of automation into the retail market. With automation also came the ability for retail managers to review sales data on a daily basis instead of having to wait for quarterly reports. This meant retailers could view near real-time the trends of their consumers and which marginal or weak brands could be replaced by much more profitable products. Data at the time suggested that generics had a much greater stock turn than branded products i.e. their sales to inventory ratio. With this powerful new technology and data, retailers quickly began dumping weak and marginal brands in favor of the much more profitable and in-demand generics. Modern Debranding In the 1980s and 90s, consumers were more concerned about value. Today’s consumer is more conscious of what they are purchasing and more cautious of large corporations, favoring local, small, independent stores. As such, the type of debranding popular in the 1980s and 90s has backfired for corporations in the 2000s. In many ways Starbucks is a perfect example of modern debranding because they strive to balance their brand identity and a local identity. Starbucks removed the name and left only the siren logo on signs and merchandise to appear less corporate and appeal to modern consumers. Starbucks has also responded to the recent popularity of shopping local by acquiring trusted local businesses. The shops retained their local names and flavors rather than becoming a Starbucks coffee shop. Another manifestation of modern debranding is the wordless logo: multinational companies have begun dropping their names from their logos, leaving only the symbols. It is psychologically easier to relate to a visual than it is to a name, meaning that consumers form stronger relationships with brands they might otherwise be critical of.

He inherited his father's trading business around the age of eighteen, and learned finance and speculation from an uncle. Placed in Parliament through a cousin's interest in 1713, his Whig politics ultimately provoked a breach with his Tory cousin, and he had to be given another seat in 1722 by Robert Walpole's administration. He rose to be Deputy Governor and then Governor of the Bank of England in 1727, but unknown to his contemporaries, his fortune was largely fictitious and he was embezzling from the Bank and his daughters' trust fund. He died suddenly in 1731, perhaps having poisoned himself to forestall the discovery of his frauds, and left behind enormous debts.  Antecedents and trade  Humphry was the only son of Humphry Morice (c. 1640–1696), a London merchant trading extensively in Africa, America, Holland and Russia, and his wife Alice, the daughter of Sir Thomas Trollope, 1st Baronet. Because of the early death of his mother, the young Humphry was raised at Werrington, the seat of his uncle Sir William Morice, 1st Baronet. He succeeded his father in his mercantile business in 1689. His father's will left him in the guardianship of his two uncles, John and Nicholas. The latter was a skilled financial speculator, who involved and trained Humphry in that business. On 26 June 1704, Humphry married Judith Sandes (d. 1720), the daughter of a London merchant, by whom he had three daughters who survived him; Elizabeth, later married her stepbrother Paggen Hale, while Judith married George Lee and Ann did not marry. Morice's mercantile business was extensive: he was one of four creditors for £18,000 of another merchant gone bankrupt in 1707, and he owned over £4,000 of Bank of England stock in 1710, making him eligible to become a director of the institution. Morice did, in fact, become a director in 1716, and continued to hold that office, He was also involved with the launch of the South Sea Company, acting as a commissioner for subscriptions in 1711. Morice several times testified on trade subjects before Parliament: in 1707 on losses in the West Indies trade due to the lack of convoys, and in 1710 and 1713 in favour of dismantling the Royal African Company's monopoly on West African trade. In light of his activity and wealth, he not unnaturally wished to enter Parliament. In 1715, Humphry Morice, who has been named \\"the foremost London slave merchant of his time\\" by the 1985 gathering of Atlantic Slave Trade Scholars at the University of Nantes, commissioned the spectacular Whydah Gally merchant ship, and the following year appointed Dutch Captain Lawrence Prince as its commander. After transporting and selling nearly 500 Africans into slavery in the Caribbean, the Whydah was captured in the lower Bahamas by the pirate Captain Samuel Bellamy and appointed his flagship. With upwards of five tons of treasure aboard Whydah taken from more than 50 ships in the Caribbean and the North American coast, Bellamy sailed her to Cape Cod where she wrecked on the shoals of Wellfleet 26 April 1717. Massachusetts Bay Colony Governor Samuel Shute commissioned noted cartographer Captain Cyprian Southack to recover anything of value from the Whydah wreck, but, as he expressed with great exasperation in a number of letters to the governor, continuing storms, deadly surf and intense resistance from the local community prevented the recovery of anything valuable. In 1984, underwater explorer Barry Clifford discovered the Whydah, and in 1985 he recovered the ship's bell embossed with the words \\"The Whydah Gally 1716\\", making it the world's first (and, as of 2014, the only) fully authenticated pirate shipwreck ever discovered.  Parliamentary career  Humphry's cousin Sir Nicholas had succeeded to the Werrington estate baronetcy in 1690, and with it a very strong electoral interest the boroughs of Launceston and Newport. Humphry asked Nicholas to put him into Parliament in 1710, but as all his seats were already promised, Humphry did not enter the House of Commons until 1713, sitting with Nicholas for Newport. Unlike the Tory Nicholas, Humphry leaned towards the Whigs, and voted in 1714 against the expulsion of Sir Richard Steele from Parliament for advocating the Hanoverian succession in a pamphlet. His recorded Parliamentary activity shows a continued interest in the African trade. Humphry \\"appeared in a most splendid manner at court\\" to celebrate the birthday of the new Prince of Wales in late 1714, considerably irritating his cousin. Nonetheless, Nicholas again put Humphry in for Newport at the 1715 election. The bond between the two was violently strained in 1716, when Humphry, after giving Nicholas to understand that he opposed the Septennial Act, voted for it instead. Humphry followed Robert Walpole into opposition to the government the following year, and for the time being, both he and Nicholas were opponents of the sitting ministry. However, on Walpole's return to the cabinet in 1720, he recruited Humphry to whip the London Whigs for crucial votes. Nicholas ran out of patience, and rather brusquely informed Humphry to look to Walpole for a seat, as he would not be returning him for Newport at the next election. Walpole was, in fact, willing to do so, and arranged through Lord Falmouth to have Morice returned for Grampound in 1722, and again in 1727. Meanwhile, Morice's wife had died in 1720, and on 5 June 1722, he married Catherine, daughter of Peter Paggen of Wandsworth, Surrey, and widow of William Hale. They had two sons, Humphry (1723–1785) and Nicholas (d. 1748).  Embezzlement and death  Morice served as Deputy Governor of the Bank of England from 1725 to 1726, and as Governor from 1727 to 1729. During this period, he defrauded the bank of £29,000 by presenting fictitious bills of exchange for discounting by the Bank. He died suddenly on 16 November 1731, possibly of gout, but he was widely believed to have poisoned himself to forestall exposure. After his death, the enormous extent of his defalcations was revealed: he had not only swindled the Bank, but abstracted money from a trust fund left for his daughters by their maternal uncle, and still left debts of nearly £150,000. The Bank took action against his widow to attempt to recover its losses, ultimately settling for £12,000 after forty-three years of litigation.

Early life Logothetis was born in Cyprus, and immigrated to the United States of America at the age of six with his mother, Anna, and his father, Euthymios. During World War II, Dimitri's father was captured after the Nazis invaded Greece and was sent to a work camp in Berlin. He remained there for the duration of the war. After moving to the United States to join his family, Dimitri's father spent eight years working as a mechanic in Los Angeles and became an American citizen. Logothetis attended Beverly Vista Grammar School and Lawndale High School in the Los Angeles South Bay area where he played football and ran track. In 1975, Logothetis received a black belt in Tang Soo Do from world champion martial arts Master Howard Jackson.

While he was working on New York, New York, Martin Scorsese suggested that he attend film school because of his skillful storytelling. He got a scholarship and attended Loyola Marymount University, where he received a Master of Arts in film and television directing. There he adapted a Woody Allen short story, \\"Mr. Big,\\" and made it his thesis short film, calling it Call Me Kaiser. He directed, produced and starred in the film, which won prizes at the Athens, Ohio International Film Festival and in 1979 the award for \\"Best Short Film\\" at the Samuel Z. Arkoff film festival. In his last year at Loyola, Logothetis was hired by Capitol Records to direct a documentary about the US tour of the rock band The Knack. He was then hired by Columbia Pictures to produce his first film, Hardbodies 2. In 1987 he directed his first feature film for New World Pictures, Pretty Smart, and developed a horror film, Slaughterhouse Rock, for United Artists. In 1989 he made a documentary about five heavyweight boxers who dominated the sport in their time, Champions Forever, with Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. Danny Aiello then came to Logothetis with a stage play, Wheel Barrel Closers, which Logothetis adapted for the screen and directed under the title The Closer, starring Aiello, Diane Baker and Michael Paré. He then acquired the rights to a Stephen King script written specifically for the screen, and produced Sleepwalkers for Columbia Pictures. In 1994 Logothetis directed and produced Body Shot, a film noir thriller starring Robert Patrick, for HBO. He then moved into the Western genre and produced and directed Cheyenne, starring Bo Svensen and Gary Hudson. In 1999 Logothetis was hired by Warner Brothers and directed the pilot for the television series Robin Hood. He directed Mike Hammer, starring Stacy Keach, for Franklin Waterman. He then directed the pilot episode for the action adventure series Air America, starring Lorenzo Lamas, and went on to direct eight more episodes. In 2000, Logothetis was hired by Warner Brothers to be the executive producer of the science fiction action adventure TV series Code Name: Eternity. He was responsible for the creative look and feel of the series and for writing and directing the pilot episode. The next year, Warner Brothers asked him to serve as executive producer and to direct another TV anthology, The Dark Realm, where he edited the two-hour pilot episode and supervised the screenwriting. He then developed, produced and directed a Lifetime world premier film, The Lost Angel, starring Alison Eastwood, Judd Nelson and John Rhys Davies. Logothetis, along with his long-time friend Nick Celozzi, acquired the life story rights to Sam Giancana, the 1960s Chicago mob boss, and set up as well as wrote a six-hour mini-series on him for Mark Wolper and TNT.

He then set up a remake of All of Me with John Davis and DreamWorks, which he is set to produce. In 2013, Logothetis took up Giancana again, and along with his project partner Nick Celozzis, wrote, produced and directed a documentary on him, Momo: The Sam Giancana Story, which won The 2013 Monaco Film festival, \\"Best Feature Documentary\\" award and the 2012 Hollywood Reel Independent Film Festival \\"Best Feature Documentary\\" award. In 2015, he produced a remake of Kickboxer with Ted Field and Radar Pictures. Logothetis wrote and produced Kickboxer: Vengeance starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and the new kickboxer, Alain Moussi, with other talents such as Dave Bautista, Georges Saint-Pierre, and Gina Carano. Logothetis was attracted to the original Jean- Claude Van Damme's Kickboxer because of his martial arts background and that's what inspired him to pursue the rights to the original, develop a reboot of the franchise and ultimately write, produce and direct a contemporary version of the pop culture, iconic Kickboxer. It was important that Logothetis to convince Van Damme to step into the role of mentor to ordain a new, high octane Kickboxer who has a sixth degree black belt in Jiu-Jitsu, Alain Moussi. Because Kickboxer: Vengeance was such a successful independent feature in the world market, it generated a sequel. In 2016, Logothetis wrote and directed the sequel Kickboxer: Retaliation which brought new talent such as Hafþór júlíus björnsson from Game of Thrones and Christopher Lambert, \\"The Highlander\\". Currently Dimitri is editing and supervising visual effects for a new science fiction martial arts franchise “Jiu Jitsu,” which he is preparing as a feature film. In addition, Dimitri acquired the rights to “Man of War,” a Gary Scott Thompson original screenplay. Gary wrote and created the $6 billion dollar “Fast and Furious” Universal Pictures film franchise. Dimitri is developing two other Kings properties as well, “All of Me”, originally with Steve Martin and Lilly Tomlin and “The Best of Times”, originally with Kurt Russell and Robin Williams. Dimitri is producing these projects with Todd Garner, former President of production of Disney. Also, Dimitri is in the pre- production process for the third and final film in the trilogy, Kickboxer: Armageddon.

The game can be played by many players seated around a table and is often played in large groups. Each player possesses a cup and in unison the players tap out the defined rhythm using their cups. It can be played competitively, where the rhythm speeds up in each \\"round\\", and a player making a mistake in the rhythm must drop out of the game, with a new \\"round\\" starting after each elimination, and game play continuing until only one player remains, with that player being the winner. Cup game rhythm The cup game begins with a cup placed upside down in front of each player. Assuming a right-handed player, the rhythm normally proceeds as follows: *Beat #1: Clap twice *Beat #2: Alternating hands, quickly tap the top of the cup with the fingertips three times (In some variations, the table on either side of the cup is tapped) *Beat #3: Clap once **Pick up the cup with the right hand and move it to the right *Beat #4: Put the cup down onto the table (still upside down) with a firm percussive motion *Beat #1: Clap once **Pick up the cup with the right hand so that the cup is now right-side up *Beat #2: Tap the top of the cup (the open end of the cup) with the flat of the left hand so as to make a hollow-sounding hit **Put the cup down onto the table (now right- side up) with a firm percussive motion, but keeping the right hand on the cup *Beat #3: Switch the cup into your left hand **Slap the right hand down flat onto the table *Beat #4: With the cup still in the left hand, return the cup to its original starting position, upside down on the table in front of the player. Repeat the above sequence indefinitely until a mistake is made by a player, such as being off-beat, knocking the cup over, missing a step, etc. Some versions involve variations where the players exchange cups during the performance of the rhythm, or players slap hands with each other. Another cup game rhythm In the Lulu and the Lampshades (and newer) performances, this is the right hand which slaps down flat onto the table. *Beat #1: Clap twice or thrice *Beat #2: Alternating hands, rapidly tap the top of the cup with the fingertip three times (In some variations, the table on either side of the cup is tapped) *Beat #3: Clap once **Pick up the cup with the right hand and move it to the right *Beat #4: Put the cup down onto the table (still upside down) with a firm percussive motion *Beat #1: Clap once **Pick up the cup with the right hand (thumb down) so that the cup is now right-side up *Beat #2: Tap the top of the cup (the open end of the cup) with the flat of the left hand so as to make a hollow-sounding hit **Put the cup down onto the table (now right-side up) with a firm percussive motion, but keeping the right hand on the cup *Beat #3: With the cup still in the right hand, tap the bottom of the cup with the flat of the left hand and take it with the left hand **Slap the right hand down flat onto the table (near the player's left side) *Beat #4: With the cup now in the left hand, return the cup to its original starting position, upside down on the table in front of the player (or in front of the player to the right) with a firm percussive motion Repeat the above sequence indefinitely. In music Christian singer Rich Mullins used the cup game to accompany his song \\"Screen Door\\" on his 1987 album Pictures in the Sky. It was used by Palavra Cantada (Paulo Tatit & Sandra Peres) in 1998 with the song \\"Fome Come\\" from their album \\"Canções Curiosas\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mccYgybzeU In 2009 the band Lulu and the Lampshades used the game in their performance of the 1930 Carter Family song When I'm Gone as modified to suit the game by \\"Lulu\\" (Luisa Gerstein). Rapper P.O.S also uses the cup game in \\"Optimist (We Are Not for Them)\\" from his 2009 album Never Better. In 2011 the cup game was again used by Anna Burden to accompany the song \\"When I'm Gone\\" in a YouTube video that went viral. Anna Kendrick taught herself to copy Burden's video, and this was worked into her performance in the 2012 film Pitch Perfect, her version \\"Cups (When I'm Gone)\\" in turn becoming widely copied with a 2013 video after the single from the soundtrack rose on the national and international charts. History There are older cup games as well, with rhythmic moving and passing of cups. Often there is a particular place in the rhythm where the passing is different, faster, or more difficult, and missing this pass puts a player \\"out\\", a new \\"round\\" beginning with each elimination, and the last player winning. One such game is called \\"Acitrón de un fandango\\" (or various alternate spelling), and is said to originate in Mexico.In Henrietta Yurchenco, Latin American Children Game Songs.

Each class is limited to 11 students with one teaching artist and several adult volunteer mentors. Core classes include three levels of traditional black and white film and two levels of digital photography. Classes meet twice weekly over nine weeks for a total of 60 hours of instruction, plus time spent outside class working on assignments, and the schedule mirrors the Seattle Public Schools calendar. History =Founding= Youth in Focus was founded in 1994 by retired high school teacher Walter Bodle. During his 30-year teaching career in Compton, California, Walter would ask, \\"What is the big difference that makes one young person become a successful orthopedic surgeon, and the one who sat next to him in class is dead or in jail before the age of 20?\\" The answer always was found with an adult who took time to care and support.Faculty and Board of Youth in Focus The organization started summer photography program in a borrowed darkroom, and as a result, 14 youths completed the first 10-week session of Youth in Focus. The organization was incorporated as a non-profit in 1997. Today, this nationally-recognized program has afternoon and summer sessions and serves nearly 200 participants each year. The organization offers free classes year-round in a purpose-built photography space. Youth and Focus continues to expand its service through partnerships with other local youth service agencies and by providing advice and encouragement across the country to other groups who seek to emulate our model of youth empowerment through photography. When not traveling, Walter lives in Seattle's Madrona neighborhood with his wife, Lynne Iglitzin, and dog, Candy. Youth in Focus began working with the Raikes Foundation in 2010 to participate in the Youth Program Quality Initiative. Youth Program Quality Assessment (YPQA) scores for Youth in Focus, in the Spring of 2011 and 2012, were consistently higher than comparison scores for 780 other National Youth programs. Our scores were higher in all main categories, and significantly higher in Supportive Environment and Youth Engagement. =Recent events= Most recently, Youth and Focus was chosen by KEXP-FM, Starbucks and Seattle Theater Group as at the beneficiary of The Little Big Show #5. Working together, they raised over $14,000 for the students. Mission statement Youth in Focus's mission is to empower urban youth, through photography, to experience their world in new ways and to make positive choices for their lives. The organization's goal is to put cameras in the hands of low income, at-risk youth and place them in a challenging environment surrounded by high quality talented teachers, nurturing adult volunteer mentors, and create a strong community of support.The Seattle Foundation: Youth and Focus Through photography, the students are able to find their voice, identity, creativity, and gain new confidence in their worth and abilities. After an interview process, accepted students are given a $1,000 scholarship, covering the total cost of instruction and equipment. Classes meet with their teaching artists and mentors twice a week for three hours over a nine-week quarter. Students submit, display and discuss their final work during our End of Quarter Show. Youth in Focus partners with other agencies to provide photography workshops in order to expand our reach and to enhance the partner's regular programming. The organization has worked with community centers, schools and other youth service agencies. They are currently partnering with Friends of the Children and Youth Care, South Lake High School and Big Picture High School, among others.Youth in Focus: Changing Lives in Seattle Through Art and Photography Accomplishments The President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities recognized Youth in Focus as a model program in the year 2000, providing \\"life-changing activities\\" to youth with limited opportunities. Our students have shown their work at the Seattle Art Museum, Henry Art Gallery, Frye Art Museum, Benham Gallery and the Washington State Convention Center, and among other local venues. The prestige of these locations is a testament to both to the quality of the work the students produce, and their passion for the medium.

He was the author of Bread Salesmanship, which became the training manual for Allied Bakeries in the 1960s. Originally making his pies in his own home, he built the company up until retiring at the age of 65, but remained chairman until his death. As of his time of his death, the company turned over £40 million a year. Early life Storer was born in Leicester on 11 July 1930. He attended Alderman Newton's School, and after leaving school at the age of sixteen he worked in the family bakery, which had been founded by his grandfather in 1899. Following his National service, which he spent as an instructor at the British Army's bakery school, he rejoined the family firm. In 1960, the company was sold to Allied Bakeries and Storer was persuaded to become a trainee manager. He wrote a book entitled Bread Salesmanship, which was used by Allied as a training manual. Pukka Pies He left Allied Bakeries in 1963, and sold his Austin-Healey Sprite to fund the opening of his own company. Initially called Trevor Storer's Home Made Pies, as they were made in his home in Earl Shilton, he sold 1,200 steak and kidney pies in the first week, mainly to pubs. He expanded the range to include chicken and mushroom pies, turning over £12,000 in the first year. In 1964 the company was renamed to Pukka Pies at the suggestion of his wife. She later explained that it was so named as it was a fashionable term at the time and \\"represented something that was top-notch\\". Under Storer's management, the company slowly expanded across the UK and opened a factory in Syston, Leicestershire. He retired in 1995 at the age of 65, but remained Chairman of the company. His two sons, Tim and Andrew, took over the day-to-day running of the business as joint managing directors. The company celebrated its 50th anniversary in early 2013, by which time it was selling 60 million pies a year. Storer died at his home on 31 July 2013, survived by his wife, two sons and daughter Susan.

He then solved the high-order equation by Southern Song dynasty mathematician Qin Jiushao's \\"Ling long kai fang\\" method published in Shùshū Jiǔzhāng (“Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections”) in 1247 (more than 570 years before English mathematician William Horner's method using synthetic division). To do this, he makes use of the Pascal triangle, which he labels as the diagram of an ancient method first discovered by Jia Xian before 1050. Zhu also solved square and cube roots problems by solving quadratic and cubic equations, and added to the understanding of series and progressions, classifying them according to the coefficients of the Pascal triangle. He also showed how to solve systems of linear equations by reducing the matrix of their coefficients to diagonal form. His methods predate Blaise Pascal, William Horner, and modern matrix methods by many centuries. The preface of the book describes how Zhu travelled around China for 20 years as a teacher of mathematics. Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns consists of four books, with 24 classes and 288 problems, in which 232 problems deal with Tian yuan shu, 36 problems deal with variable of two variables, 13 problems of three variables, and 7 problems of four variables.

It is also known as Marigudi, with \\"Doddamma\\" denoting the \\"elder sister\\" of all Mariammas in Karnataka. The central icon is an eight-armed image of Durga, also known by the names Renuka and Yellamma. It was built in 1688. It is to the east of Gokarna. Features The temple's façade, a 19th-century addition, is painted blue. After one enters through the façade, there is courtyard in the middle, which has cloisters surrounding it. The cloisters are filled with images of deities from the Hindu epics. The changes made inside the temple have hidden any evidence of older structures. The sanctum sanctorum has the central image of a fierce form of the goddess Durga, multi-armed (eight shoulders), riding a tiger and killing a demon. It is believed that the image was retrieved from a pond on the road to Hanagal. The temple has very special paintings of murals in Kaavi art, an art form which was popular in the coastal Konkan region of Karnataka. In this art form, now extinct, the top plastered layer of the mural was first dyed with a red pigment, which when removed revealed a lower white layer of plaster over which the murals were created It is said that the first Marikamba Devi idol was crafted in kortagere . Worship HE-Buffalo MarikambaTemple The main priest at the temple belongs to the carpenter, or Vishvakarma, caste. Kanakadasa, a famous saint poet of the Bhakti movement, had visited the temple and advised the people to stop animal sacrifice of the he-buffalo. When Mahatma Gandhi visited Sirsi in 1934, during his campaign to abolish untouchability of Dalits, he refused to visit the temple, as animal sacrifice was a prevalent ancient practice at the temple; the sacrifice was in the form of offering of he-buffalo as a sacrifice to appease the goddess. A he-buffalo was specially bred for offering as a sacrifice to the deity during the annual Rathayatra. Following the protest by Gandhi, there was a social movement in the town not only to abolish animal sacrifice but also to allow Dalits entry into the temple. This movement was spearheaded by Keshwain, chief trustee of the temple, in association with Vitthal Rao Hodike, a teacher and dedicated Gandhian of the town. Both objectives of the movement were fulfilled. Jaatre The Sirsi Marikamba jaatre (chariot procession) of the deity is held every alternate year in the month of March and taken through the town. It is attended by a very large number of devotees. It is said to be the most famous and biggest fair (jaatre) of the state of Karnataka. Devotees from all around the state participate in this enormous event indulging themselves in the procession. Amusements for children, circuses, variety of shops, dramas and plays and many such things are set up for the people. It depicts the story of the goddess killing mahishasura.

Sir Lucas Pepys, 1809 engraving by James Godby after Henry Edridge Life The son of William Pepys, a banker, and his wife Hannah, daughter of Dr. Richard Russell of Brighton, was born in London on 26 May 1742. He was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, whence he graduated B.A. on 9 May 1764. He then studied medicine at Edinburgh, and afterwards graduated at Oxford, M.A. on 13 May 1767, M.B. on 30 April 1770, and M.D. on 14 June 1774. Before his M.B. degree Pepys obtained a license to practice from the university of Oxford, took a house in London, and on 10 February 1769 was elected physician to the Middlesex Hospital, and held office for seven years. In the summer he used to practise at Brighton. He was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1775, was censor in 1777, 1782, 1786, and 1796, treasurer from 1788 to 1798, and president from 1804 to 1810. In 1777 he was appointed physician-extraordinary to the king, and in 1792 physician-in- ordinary. He was created a baronet on 22 January 1784. Pepys was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1780.royalsociety.org, Pepys; Sir; Lucas (1742 - 1830). Pepys attended George III in his mental disorder of 1788–9, and in that of 1804. He was examined on the subject of the king's health by a committee of the House of Commons on 7 January 1789. He then thought it likely that the king would recover in time, and stated that he had observed signs of improvement. He attended two days a week at Kew Palace, where the king was, from four in the afternoon till eleven the next morning, having a consultation often either with Sir George Baker or Dr. Richard Warren. In 1794 Pepys was made physician-general to the army, and was president of an army medical board, on which it was his duty to nominate all the army physicians. When so many soldiers fell ill of fever at Walcheren, he was ordered to go there and report. As a consequence the board was abolished; but Pepys was granted a pension. Pepys had a large practice, and after Edward Jenner's discovery he was an active supporter of the National Vaccine Institution. His house was in Park Street, Grosvenor Square, and he died there on 17 June 1830. He was described as a man \\"of great firmness and determination, but somewhat dictatorial in his manner\\". Works Pepys's only published work was the Latin preface to the London Pharmacopœia of 1809. Family Pepys married, on 30 October 1772, Jane Elizabeth Leslie, 12th Countess of Rothes in her own right, and widow of George Evelyn of St Clere, Kent, and had by her two sons, Charles and Henry, and a daughter, Harriet, who married William Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon. He married again, on 29 June 1813, Deborah, daughter of Dr. Anthony Askew and his second wife Elizabeth Holford, who survived him. Each of his sons, who took their mother's family name, succeeded to the baronetcy in turn. Like her husband, Lady Rothes was a strong and determined character, who fought a lengthy legal battle against her uncle Andrew Leslie to assert her right to succeed her brother, the 11th Earl, as Countess suo jure.

He is best known as lead singer of the visual kei bands Lareine and Versailles. He has also been the head of two independent record labels; the first being Applause Records (formed in 2000), and currently Sherow Artist Society since 2006, being renamed to Chateau Agency since 2016. His music covers many genres, Lareine having mainly a baroque pop style, and Versailles a clear symphonic and neoclassical metal sound. He has an extensive discography with the bands Lareine, New Sodmy and Versailles, consisting of 15 albums, and a large amount of EPs and singles. In 2013, Kamijo began a solo career with his debut single \\"Louis ~Enketsu no La Vie en Rose~\\". Early life Kamijo was raised in a family of musicians; his mother and grandmother were both piano players, and his grandfather a violinist. His first steps in rock were in the mid-1990s, when he worked as a roadie for the visual kei rock band Malice Mizer. He shared this job with Mayu, a guitarist with whom he formed the band Lareine. Career =1994–2007: Lareine= In August 1994, Mayu and Kamijo (then using the names Maito and Shoki respectively) met for the first time while they were working as roadies for Malice Mizer. The same year, in November, they decided to form a band together, which they named Laliene ru cheri, commonly called just Laliene (named that way for the French Queen Marie Antoinette). Along with guitarist Sakuren and drummer Kyouka, they began to play. Later bass player Emiru entered the band, completing the first line-up. In March 1996, Laliene held a live concert for their first anniversary, where they changed the name of the band to Lareine. That same year they released their first recording \\"Saikai no Hana\\", distributed freely at the anniversary concert in a limited number of 100 copies. They signed with Sony in 1998 and released the songs Metamorphose, Fiançailles, Fuyu Tokyo and Lillie Charlotte. After many years of releasing many albums, EPs and singles, during a short separation of the band, Kamijo created the band New Sodmy, and recorded two albums and five singles. New Sodmy disbanded while Lareine was reformed in 2003 and started releasing new material. In February 2007, Lareine finally came to its end, having played their last live on October 31, 2006. The last recording of Lareine consists of 10 piano versions of their most popular songs. =2007–2012: Versailles= In March 2007, Kamijo and Hizaki (ex- Sulfuric Acid), and Jasmine You (ex-Jakura), formed the band Versailles. Later, Teru (ex-Aikaryu) and Yuki (ex-Sugar Trip), who were recommended by the Rock May Kan venue in Tokyo, joined the band. Hizaki, Jasmine You and Teru previously played together as part of Hizaki Grace Project. Versailles performing in Santiago, Chile in 2010. Kamijo and Hizaki created the concept of Versailles in the autumn of 2006 and spent six months gathering members to express it. Their band concept is \\"the absolute youshikibi (beauty of form) sound and extremes of aestheticism\\". On March 30, 2007 the details of the band were announced. They released promotional material through the internet, set up an English language page on MySpace, and had several interviews with foreign press. Versailles made their first appearance with a showcase on June 23, followed by their first performance on June 24. On these dates they also distributed their first single and DVD single, \\"The Revenant Choir\\".http://archive.metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/700/music_beat.asp The band signed with the German CLJ Records label and released the EP Lyrical Sympathy on October 31, both in Japan and Europe. Their song \\"The Love From A Dead Orchestra\\" also appeared on a compilation album released by Sony BMG in Germany on November 9, called Tokyo Rock City. On September 23, 2008, Kamijo modeled clothing for the brand Alice and the Pirates on the runway at Individual Fashion Expo IV. In January 2011, he and the rest of Versailles started starring in their own TV mini drama called . The show also starred Rina Koike and aired on Mainichi Broadcasting System and TV Kanagawa until March. On December 20, 2012, Versailles gave their last concert and ceased all activities. The band released four albums, one EP, eight singles, two live albums, ten music videos, one compilation albums and several DVDs. =2013: Solo career= In January 2013, Kamijo announced he would start a solo career, with his first release being the single \\"Louis ~Enketsu no La Vie en Rose~\\" on August 28. While all the other members of Versailles later formed the band Jupiter with a new singer, and released their first album the same day as Kamijo's single. The music video for Kamijo's single features Malice Mizer and Moi dix Mois leader Mana. Kamijo also sang backup on the 2013 debut album Heartstrings by Aisenshi, the new band of Eizo Sakamoto (Anthem) and She-Ja (Volcano).

These meetings were often held by Protestants, in this case, Methodists. Mountain Grove Campground was a site and resort on the Danville, Hazleton and Wilkes- Barre Railroad in Black Creek Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It existed for approximately 30 years and was run by the Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association. A businessman named G.M. Shoop was the original owner of the campground's land. Many prominent citizens of the surrounding area were in the association. During the campground's operation between 1872 and 1901, it was renovated and expanded several times. While the camp meetings that were held there were intended for Methodists, non- Methodists occasionally attended them. Location and description The Mountain Grove Campground was located approximately halfway between Bloomsburg and Hazleton. It was adjacent to the historical community of Mountain Grove, which had a population of 65 in 1880, and was located on the Danville, Hazleton and Wilkes-Barre Railroad. Most attenders came by railroad came from stations in Catawissa or Hazleton. The campground had its own railroad station and post office. The campground's elevation was more than above sea level and it was situated in a wooded grove immediately east of McCauley Mountain and in close proximity to Scotch Valley. McCauley Mountain protected the site from strong west winds. Mountain Grove Campground was designed with a layout similar to a miniaturized version of Washington, D.C. It had a center avenue and five other avenues called A, B, C, D, and E. The center avenue ran from a large tabernacle to a living area for the preachers. There were also many tents and sites of cottages in the campground and a large administration building on the site housed a number of offices. The campground had outdoor fireplaces, which encouraged picnics. The main hall, which was constructed in 1887, was and had two stories. According to a local atlas, Mountain Grove Campground was semicircular in shape, with avenues radiating out towards the sides. An open space for worshiping was on the camp meeting site, and it was surrounded by more tents. When this area was filled up, more people would set up tents along the avenues that radiated outward from the camp. The location of the Mountain Grove Campground was chosen was selected for several reasons. One of these was its proximity to the communities of Hazleton and Bloomsburg. By road, Bloomsburg and Hazleton were both from the campground. The campground was approachable by road from three directions. Establishment and history =Early history= In June 1872, G.M. Shoop, a businessman from Danville bought 28 acres of land on the site that would become the Mountain Grove Campground. He reported this purchase in a meeting held on June 20, 1872 in Columbia County with a group of Methodists, including several ministers. In this meeting, an executive committee was appointed to arrange the camp meeting. The executive committee included Reverend S. Creighton, Reverend S. Barnes (the chairman), H.E. Sutherland (the secretary), Reverend B.P. King, Reverend E.T. Schwartz, M. Hartman, J.W. Cleaver, J.W. Eyer, and G.M. Shoop himself. Shoop intended to give the land to a local camp meeting organization once one existed. This idea was well received by the district superintendent of the Methodist Church. A committee consisting of four pastors and five lay leaders was subsequently created for the camp meeting site. Craig Newton, a history professor at what would become the Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania, stated that the site purchased by Shoop would be an ideal location for a camp meeting site. The Danville District's presiding elder, Reverend S. Barnes, went to the Central Pennsylvania Conference in 1872 to make a report on opening the Mountain Grove Campground. He stated that the managers of the campground intended to \\"make it, perhaps, the best adapted and most attractive resort of its kind in all our Conference territory.\\" Camp meeting sites had long been supported by the Central Pennsylvania Conference. The Pennsylvania legislature chartered the campground in 1873. A professional architect was hired to design the Mountain Grove Campground. Major financial contributors to the campground included a Colonel Jackson from Berwick and the Low family from Lime Ridge. It was under the auspices of the Pennsylvania Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church's Danville District. The campground was initially laid out hurriedly, being constructed in less than two months. It opened for the first time on August 14, 1872. By this point, approximately 70 small and hastily constructed cottages (referred to as tents) had been built. Between the 1872 camp meeting season and the 1873 camp meeting season, the buildings of the campground were significantly renovated. Three more acres and a hotel were also added to the campground during this time, on land bought from George W. Klase. The purpose of the purchase was to stop the sale of alcoholic drinks within two miles of the campground. Between 1873 and 1874, further additions were made to the campground. In 1875, a special train started to run past the campground three times a week during the camp meeting season. By 1881, the special train ran past the campground once per day. In 1884, the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Philadelphia and Reading Railway began selling special fair excursion tickets for the campground. The campground was extended to 34 acres by 1885. The Lehigh Valley Railroad began doing so as well in 1887. In the beginning of the operation of Mountain Grove Campground, the majority of people traveling there were worshipers. In the 1870s and 1880s, the campground was one of the three largest camp meeting sites that residents of Columbia County attended. In 1875, approximately 2500 people attended the camp meeting. In 1881, it was decided that all the profit generated from the campground would be dedicated to expansion and improvement of it. In 1891, the duration of the camp meeting was increased from seven to thirteen days. However, some people traveled there for a vacation. Within 20 years of the campground's opening, the majority of the people going there were there for a vacation, and trains carried bands and other entertainment-related items to the campground. However, people still continued to go there in large numbers for camp meeting. Local newspapers also began to advertise the campground as a resort instead of a camp meeting site. This began with an advertisement written by John R. Rote, secretary of the Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association, in the Columbia County Republican on July 9, 1891. The Mountain Grove Campground was affected relatively little by storms, as compared to other camp meeting sites in the area. However, in 1889, attendance of the camp meeting was significantly affected by inclement weather. =Expansions and renovations= Between the 1872 and 1873 camp meeting seasons, the cottages, also known as tents, in the Mountain Grove Campground were renovated. The renovations included enlarging the tents to dimensions of . Roofs with singled combs were also installed during this renovation. The stairways on the cottages were also improved during this time. Between the 1873 and the 1874 camp meeting seasons, the Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association added more tents to the campground, increasing their number to almost 200. They also built a boarding house above the dining hall and a tabernacle was constructed across from the auditorium. Several more expansions and renovations were made to the Mountain Grove Campground in the 1880s. In 1883, the boarding house was expanded and in 1885, a number of water pipes were renovated and some buildings were repaired and repainted. The main office of the campground was built in 1887. More renovations were done in 1889 and 1892, by which time there were 240 tents. In the 1900, a final attempt to increase the attendance of the camp meetings at Mountain Grove Campground was made by the Board of Managers. As well as general renovation, this included an addition of a building called the Preacher's Home, which was situated behind the auditorium. The purpose of this was to attract preachers to attend, thus inspiring locals to attend as well. This plan was not successful. =Decline and later history= As railroads began to become more common, attendance of the Mountain Grove Campground began to decline. The attendance of the campground dropped severely in 1891. On July 9, 1891, the campground placed an unusually large advertisement in a local newspaper. Attendance continued to drop in 1892. The decline continued, despite efforts by the campground directors to increase the number of Chautauqua speakers and religious speakers. Attempts were made throughout the 1890s to stave off the impending failure of the campground, but were largely unsuccessful. Later, the Board of Managers decided that they would open the campground specifically for special events, such as the Bloomsburg Methodist Church's plans for an eleven-car special train to carry picnickers and a band there. By the mid-1890s, it was permitted for visitors to bring their own supplies, rent multiple tents, and decide whether to stay for one or two weeks. A short branch line of the Danville, Hazleton, and Wilkes-Barre Railroad was then built to allow easier transport of visitors' baggage to the campground. Baggage carrying was also done for free and the attendance fee was also reduced. Only one of the twenty- five prominent local families who attended the camp meeting in the 1880s still attended it in the 1890s. However, one of the last camp meetings there, in 1900, was referred to as \\"interesting and profitable\\", although attendance had significantly dropped between 1898 and 1899. When the campground closed for the season in 1901, no plans were made to reopen it in 1902. The campground directors then attempted to sell the land to the Pennsylvania Railroad, but they were unsuccessful. In 1903, a farmer bought the land and the tents, buildings, and platforms were all purchased by various individuals. These items had all been sold within 18 months of the abandonment of the campground. The last sign of the campground's existence was its boardwalk, which eventually rotted away. The area where the Mountain Grove Campground used to be currently contains sump holes and scrub. The Mountain Grove Campground was stated in the 1950s by Charles A. Johnson to be a \\"new-fashioned camp meeting\\". The newspaper editor James C. Brown stated that it was \\"one of the most delightful resorts in Pennsylvania\\". =Campground visits and attendance= Camp meetings at the Mountain Grove Campground was held for seven to ten days each August. Several thousand people would attend the camp each year. By 1878, campground attendance on Saturdays had reached 4000 to 5000 people. The percentage of attendees who stayed for the whole duration of the camp meeting, as opposed to only part of it, also decreased during the 1890s. The camp meetings Camp meetings at the Mountain Grove Campground began at 7:30 p.m. on a Wednesday night with a bell that summoned the attendees to a welcome sermon. From Thursday through Saturday, days of camp meeting consisted of a prayer period at 8:30 a.m., a sermon at 10:30 a.m., a service for children at 1:30 p.m., and a second sermon at 3:30 p.m. A third sermon would be delivered by a minister from another district at 7:30 p.m. On Sundays, the day began with an \\"experience day\\" at 8:20 a.m. Other than that, Sundays were similar to other days, except that an acclaimed visitor would give a sermon at 3:00 p.m. The three days after that followed the same schedule as Thursdays through Saturdays. The camp meetings were closed at 12:30 p.m. on Thursday. Following the increase in the length of the camp meeting to 13 days, the schedule was adjusted. Thursday was designated as a temperance day. The following days were, in chronological order, designated as a Chautauqua Day, a missionary day, a Sunday School and Epworth League day, and eight days of other religious events. The meetings concluded in the campground's auditorium. The Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association added a Chautauqua Day to the camp meeting in 1885, and it became highly popular. It occurred on the first Thursday of the meeting. A number of people, including Lyman Abbot, frequented the Chautauqua Days as a speaker. To keep them from interfering with other camp meeting activities, the day was moved to the Tuesday before the official start of the meeting in 1886, but in 1889, it was moved to the first Wednesday. Financial information and leadership The Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association was formed after a decision by a nine- man committee. It was decided on August 19, 1872 that the company would be a joint-stock company. Its capital stock in 1873 was $14,000. G.M. Shoop was a significant stockholder in the company. He was the manager of the campground and the association secretary during the 1870s. High-ranking members of the Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association during the 1870s included Presiding Elder Barnes, Reverend S. Creighton, and the businessmen and politicians B.G. Welch, Mordecai W. Jackson, and A.J. Ammerman. The newspaper editor E.M. Wardin was also prominent within the association. In the early 1880s, the businessmen E.M.M. Low, Z.T. Fowler, and Lloyd T. Sharpless also became prominent in the association. The campground typically grossed approximately $4000 per year during the 1880s. In 1885, the Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association created a Chautauqua department. W.M. Gearhart was the initial president of this department and S.C. Jayne was the initial secretary.

Troma Entertainment bought the rights to the film. It was filmed in Ravenna, Ohio, with a prosumer grade camcorder. = Sequel = A sequel titled Bride of Killer Nerd was released in 1992. Reception A TV Guide review said, \\"The story is so empty that it doesn't really end; it just runs out of people to kill\\". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Verdict, said that the film \\"is a certifiable classic, a perfectly executed premise of such outrageous originality that it's amazing no one had thought of doing it before\\". Ian Jane, of DVD Talk, said that this film and its sequel are \\"typical bad horror- comedy hybrids\\" which are \\"quite dull\\", but went on to say that \\"while the movies are pretty much bottom of the barrel entertainment, they do have their own special kind of retarded charm\\".

The insolvent's diminished legal capacity entails deprivation of certain of his important legal capacities and rights, in the interests of protecting other persons, primarily the general body of existing creditors, but also prospective creditors. Insolvency is also of benefit to the insolvent, in that it grants him relief in certain respects.Wille's 387. In broad and everyday terms, a person is insolvent when he is unable to pay his debts. In legal terms, however, the test for insolvency is whether or not the debtor's liabilities, fairly estimated, exceed his assets, fairly valued. Inability to pay debts is, at most, merely evidence, and in itself, of insolvency. A person who has insufficient assets to discharge his liabilities, although he satisfies the test for insolvency, is not treated as insolvent for legal purposes unless his estate has been sequestrated by an order of court. A sequestration order is a formal declaration that a debtor is insolvent. The order is granted either at the instance of the debtor himself (voluntary surrender) or at the instance of one or more of the debtor's creditors (compulsory sequestration). The term “sequestration” should be used only with reference to a person's estate. It is the debtor's estate that is sequestrated, not the debtor himself. On the other by, both the debtor's estate and the debtor himself may properly be described as insolvent. When the word “insolvent” is used to describe a debtor, it carries two possible meanings—either # that the debtor's estate has been sequestrated; or # that his liabilities exceed his assets. The notion of “becoming insolvent,” therefore, has a wider meaning than “being sequestrated.”  Purpose of a sequestration order  The main purpose of a sequestration order is to score the orderly and equitable distribution of a debtor's assets where they are insufficient to meet the claims of all his creditors. Executing against the property of a debtor who is in insolvent circumstances inevitably results in one or a few creditors being paid, and the rest receiving little or nothing at all. The legal machinery which comes into operation on sequestration is designed to ensure that whatever assets the debtor has are liquidated and distributed among all his creditors in accordance with a predetermined (and fair) order of preference. The law proceeds from the premise that, once an order of sequestration is granted, a concursus creditorum (a “coming together of the creditors”) is established, and that the interests of creditors as a group enjoy preference over the interests of individual creditors. The debtor is divested of his estate, and may not burden it with any further debts. A creditor's right to recover his claim in full by judicial proceedings is replaced by his right, on proving a claim against the insolvent estate, to share with all other proved creditors in the proceeds of the estate assets. Apart from what is permitted in the Act, nothing may be done which would have the effect of diminishing the estate assets or prejudicing the rights of creditors. “The object of the Act,” held the court in Walker v Syfret NO, “is to ensure a due distribution of assets among creditors in the order of their preference [...]. The sequestration order crystallises the insolvent’s position; the hand of the law is laid upon the estate, and at once the rights of the general body of creditors have to be taken into consideration. No transaction can thereafter be entered into with regard to estate matters by a single creditor to the prejudice of the general body. The claim of each creditor must be dealt with as it existed at the issue of the order.”  Core concepts  The Act provides that the “estate” of a “debtor” may be sequestrated. = Estate = An estate is usually described as a collection of assets and liabilities, but a debtor who has only liabilities may be regarded as having an estate for sequestration purposes.Miller v Janks. = Debtor = A “debtor,” for the purposes of the Act, is “a person or a partnership, or the estate of a person or partnership, which is a debtor in the usual sense of the word, except a body corporate or a company or other association of persons which may be placed in liquidation under the law relating to companies.” An entity or association of persons is regarded as “a debtor in the usual sense of the word” if it is able to possess an estate and incur debts.Magnum Financial Holdings (Pty) Ltd (in liquidation) v Summerly. The entities that may be placed in liquidation under the Companies Act are * a company; * an “external” company; and * “any other body corporate.” “Body corporate” in this context refers to a juristic person or universitas. The term “debtor” therefore embraces the following: * a natural person; * a partnership (even one whose members are all juristic persons); * a deceased person and a person incapable of managing his own affairs; * an external company that does not fall within the definition of “external company” in the Companies Act (like a foreign company that has not established a place of business in the country); and * an entity or association of persons that is not a juristic person, such as a trust.  Jurisdiction of the court  Only a Provincial Division, or a Local Division of the High Court, may adjudicate on an insolvency matter. (In certain instances, though, a Magistrate's Court has jurisdiction, such as in prosecutions for criminal offences under the Act.) In terms of section 149, a court has jurisdiction “over a debtor and in regard to the estate of a debtor” * if, on the date when the application for voluntary surrender or compulsory sequestration of the debtor's estate is lodged with the registrar of the court, the debtor is domiciled, or owns the property, or is entitled to property, situated within the jurisdiction of the court; or * if, at any time within the twelve months immediately preceding the lodging of the application, the debtor ordinarily resided or carried on business within the jurisdiction of the court.  Constitutional overview  The Constitution provides a basis for the reform of all South African law. It is supreme law and contains a Bill of Rights, against which the validity of all laws may be tested. Insolvency laws pose a potential threat to a number of fundamental rights, like the right to equality, freedom and security of the person, privacy, access to information, property and administrative action. The Constitutional Court has been called upon to consider the constitutional validity of several insolvency provisions, like * section 21 of the Insolvency Act (upheld in Harksen v Lane NO); and * section 66(3) of the Insolvency Act (held in De Lange v Smuts NO to be invalid to the extent that it empowered a presiding officer at an interrogation who is not a judge or magistrate to issue a warrant of committal to prison). The issue of constitutional invalidity involves a two-fold enquiry: # Does the provision conflict with a fundamental right? # If it does, is the limitation reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom? To decide the latter issue, account must be taken of all the relevant factors, including * the nature of the right; * the importance of the purpose of the limitation; * the nature and extent of the limitation; * the relation between the limitation and its purpose; and * less restrictive means to achieve the purpose. Only if the provision is neither reasonable nor justifiable, taking all pertinent factors into consideration, may the conclusion be drawn that it is unconstitutional.  Condonation of irregularities or non-compliance with formalities  Sometimes a party making an application, or taking a step in terms of the Act, will omit prescribed details, or fail to act within the time stipulated, or commit some other procedural breach. When this happens, it is important to establish whether what has been done is invalid by reason of the defect or irregularity. The starting point is section 157(1), which provides that “nothing done under the Act will be invalid by reason of a formal defect or irregularity, unless a substantial injustice has been thereby done, which in the opinion of the court cannot be remedied by any order of the court.” The effect of this is the following: * If a formal defect has not caused a substantial injustice, the procedural step in question is valid. It is said that the court may condone the defect in these circumstances, but this seems incorrect, since section 157 does not confer on the court the power to condone defects.Ex parte Slabbert. * If a formal defect has caused a substantial injustice, but the prejudice to creditors can, in the opinion of the court, be remedied by an appropriate order, then the defect is not fatal—provided, of course, that the party concerned complies with the corrective order. * If a formal defect has resulted in a substantial injustice, and the prejudice to creditors cannot be cured by any order of the court, then the procedural step is invalid.  Procedure  There are two ways in which a debtor's estate may be sequestrated: # A creditor or creditors (or their agent) may apply to court for the sequestration of the debtor's estate (s 9(1)). This is called compulsory sequestration. # The debtor himself (or his agent) may apply to court for acceptance of the surrender of his estate (s 3(1)). This is known as voluntary surrender. The procedure and requirements for each method differ in material respects (although the consequences of the sequestration order are same in both instances). = Voluntary surrender = An application by the debtor for the sequestration of his estate for the benefit of creditors is termed a \\"voluntary surrender\\" of the estate. A court may accept the surrender if the debtor proves, among other things, that his liabilities exceed his assets. The debtor's aim in surrendering the estate is, as a rule, to escape a financial position which has become intolerable. It has been pointed out, though, that \\"the machinery of voluntary surrender was primarily designed for the benefit of creditors, and not for the relief of harassed debtors.\\"Ex Parte: Pillay 1955 (2) SA 309 (N) 311. The court, therefore, has to be satisfied that the surrender will be to the advantage of creditors.  Who may apply?  The following persons may apply to surrender the estates mentioned: * In the case of the estate of a natural person, the debtor himself or his agent may apply. If an agent applies, he must be expressly authorised to do so. * In the case of the estate of a deceased debtor, the executor may apply. * In the case of the estate of a debtor who is incapable of managing his own affairs, the party entrusted with administering the estate may apply. * In the case of a partnership estate, all the members of the partnership who reside in the Republic, or their agent, may apply. * In the case of the joint estate of spouses married in community of property, both spouses may apply.  Requirements  The court may accept the surrender of a debtor's estate only if it is satisfied * that the debtor's estate is, in fact, insolvent; * that the debtor owns realisable property of sufficient value to defray all costs of the sequestration, which will, in terms of the Act, be payable out of the free residue of his estate; and * that sequestration will be to the advantage of creditors. In addition, the court must be satisfied that certain preliminary formalities have been observed. = Debtor’s estate insolvent = A debtor is insolvent if the amount of his total liabilities exceeds the value of all his assets. The extent of the debtor's assets and liabilities is generally determined by reference to the statement of affairs which he is required to prepare and file, but the court is not bound by the valuations in the statement;Ex parte Van den Berg. it may make a finding of insolvency even where the statement indicates that his assets exceed his liabilities. The test is whether it is established that the debtor is without funds to pay his debts in full, and whether it is improbable that the assets will realise enough for this purpose.Ex parte Harmse. = Free residue sufficient to pay costs of sequestration = The “costs of sequestration” include the costs not only of surrender but also of all the general costs of administration. “Free residue” is defined in section 2 as “that portion of the estate which is not subject to any right of preference by reason of any special mortgage, legal hypothec, pledge or right of retention.” It includes the balance of the proceeds of encumbered property after discharge of the encumbrances. For the purpose of calculating the amount of free residue in an estate, therefore, the surplus in value of encumbered assets over the amount of the encumbrances must be taken into consideration. “It is necessary,” the court held in Ex parte Van Heerden, “to consider whether the surplus of the proceeds of the immovable property, after satisfying the mortgage bonds which have a preferential claim thereon, can be considered as ‘free residue’ within the meaning of that expression as used in the Act.” The definition of “free residue” must be taken to refer to that portion of an estate under sequestration when liquidated, which is not subject to any right of preference. In estimating the free residue in an estate, the surplus in value of immovable property over the amount of mortgage bonds thereon may be included in such estimate. Goods bought by the debtor under an instalment-sale transaction also form part of the free residue, to the extent that their market value exceeds the balance outstanding in terms of the transaction. A logical result of the requirement that the debtor must own sufficient property to meet the costs of sequestration is that a debtor who has no assets, only liabilities, cannot surrender his estate. If it is clear that the free residue is insufficient, the court must refuse the application. The insufficiency cannot be cured by the furnishing of a guarantee, since the guarantee does not have the effect of creating an asset in the debtor's estate. If, however, it is uncertain whether the free residue is sufficient, the court may grant the application, provided a guarantee for costs has been furnished. The guarantee in such a case is regarded as removing the uncertainty. = Sequestration to be to advantage of creditors = The debtor has to prove that sequestration will be to the advantage of creditors, whereas, in an application for compulsory sequestration, the creditor has to show merely that there is reason to believe that it will be. The onus, then, is more strenuous in the case of voluntary surrender than in the case of compulsory sequestration. One reason for this is that a debtor can normally be expected to provide a detailed account of his own financial position, whereas a sequestrating creditor would generally not have access to this information. Another reason is to reduce the ever-present risk of the debtor abusing the sequestration procedure and resorting to sequestration when it holds little or no real benefit for creditors and simply gives the debtor a means of escaping his liabilities.  Preliminary formalities  The steps which must be followed prior to the application for surrender are set out in section 4. Formal defects do not necessarily invalidate the application. = Notice of intention to surrender = The first step to be taken by a debtor who wishes to surrender his estate is the publication of a notice of surrender in the Government Gazette and in a newspaper circulating in the magisterial district where he resides (or, if he is a trader, a newspaper circulating in the district where he has his principal place of business). The notice must comply substantially with Form A, and must state * the full names, address and occupation of the debtor; * the date upon which, and the particular division of the High Court before which, the application for acceptance of the surrender will be made; and * when and where the debtor's statement of affairs will lie for inspection as required by the Act. The purpose of the notice is to alert all creditors of the intended application, in case they should wish to oppose it. It follows that the notice must be published in a newspaper in the usual sense. What if the newspaper was published in Hebrew and was devoted only to Jewish interests, as in Ex parte Goldman? The answer is that this would not suffice. The newspaper must be one which caters to general interests. What if all the creditors are in KwaZulu Natal (KZN), but the debtor has just moved to the Western Cape, as in Ex parte Barton? The court held that it should be published in KZN, since its purpose is to notify the creditors. Publication of the notice of surrender may be proved by means of an affidavit enclosing copies of the relevant Government Gazette and newspaper.  Time limits  Publication of the notice in the Government Gazette and newspaper must take place not more than thirty days, and not less than fourteen days, before the date stated in the notice as the date for the hearing of the application. The purpose of the fourteen-day time limit is to ensure that creditors have sufficient opportunity to peruse the statement of affairs and to decide whether or not to oppose the application. The legislature's objective in imposing the thirty-day limit was to ensure that debtors would not be able to give long notice, months beforehand, and in that way to keep creditors from levying execution and in the meantime dissipate all their assets. Failure to adhere strictly to the third-day time period has mostly been taken to be fatal to the application. In Ex parte Harmse, the court held that the failure is a formal defect or irregularity, as envisaged by section 157(1), and therefore does not invalidate the application unless it has caused a substantial injustice which cannot be remedied by a court order. = Notice to creditors and other parties = Within seven days of publication of the notice of surrender, the debtor must furnish copies of the notice all to creditors whose addresses are known, and to other parties, including employees. Compliance with this requirement may be proved by means of an affidavit (made either by the debtor or by his attorney) giving details of the steps taken.Ex parte Harmse.  Notice to each creditor  The debtor must deliver a copy of the notice to every one of his creditors. The object of this requirement is to provide further protection to creditors who may wish to contest the application or take steps to safeguard their interests. Failure to do this may be fatal to the application, although courts may be prepared to condone non-compliance with the time period.  Notice to trade union and employees  The debtor must post a copy of the notice to every registered trade union that represents his employees. In addition, the debtor must give notice to the employees themselves. Notice must be given to the employees on a notice board, if the employees have access to such, or on the front gate or door of the debtor's business premises, and must be posted to the trade unions that represent the employees.  Notice to SARS  The debtor is further required to send a copy of the notice by post to the South African Revenue Service (SARS). = Preparation and lodging of statement of affairs =  Preparation of statement  The statement of affairs referred to in the notice of surrender must be framed substantially in accordance with Form B in the First Schedule. It comprises the following: * a balance sheet; * a list of immovable assets, with the estimated value of each asset and details of any mortgages on the assets—Annexure I; * a list of any movable property not included in Annexures III or V (see below), setting out the value of each asset mentioned—Annexure II;Merchandise (ie, stock-in-trade) listed in this annexure must be valued either at its cost price or at its market value at the time of the making of the affidavit verifying the statement of affairs (as to which, see below), depending on which amount is the lower, and the annexure must be supported by detailed stock sheets relating to the merchandise. In Ex parte Nel 1954 (2) SA 638 (0), the applicant disclosed stock-in-trade in his annexure but failed to support it by detailed stock sheets, merely handing in at the hearing a stock book containing the relevant details. The court dismissed the application, holding that the omission to supply stock sheets is not a formal defect which the court can condone. Van Blerk J remarked (at 639) that stock sheets are of material interest for creditors and are the only way in which the sheriff can determine the precise extent of the merchandise when he makes an attachment (see 8.2). This rule has not been applied in other divisions (e.g., Exparte Dogo 1938 WLD 187; Ex parte Arnold 1939 CPD 392; Ex parte Lee 1956 (4) SA 587 (0)). In Ex parte Lee, Milne J said (at 587), “I [...] think [...] that it is really a question of the degree of detail which should be furnished in any particular case. To some extent it seems that the question depends on whether it sufficiently emerges that there are sufficient assets to pay the costs of administering the [applicant’s] estate [....] In some cases it may be necessary to show considerable detail so that due possession of the assets surrendered may be taken by the sheriff and the trustee.” Failure to mention realizable movable property where such property exists may lead to dismissal of the application (Ex parte Bouwer and similar applications 2009 (6) SA 382 (GNP) 385-6). * a list of debtors with their residential and postal addresses, details of each debt, and an estimate of the extent to which the debts are “good,” or “bad or doubtful”—Annexure III;In Ex parte Silverstone 1968 (2) SA 196 (O) 198, Hofmeyer J said, “The object of the Legislature in requiring the applicant to furnish not only the name but also the residential as well as the postal address of his debtors, must doubtless have been to enable creditors to trace these debtors and so to form their own independent opinion of the applicant’s estimated values of his good and bad debts.” In casu, the applicant, instead of giving the names and addresses of certain debtors, had merely stated “sundry debtors.” The court held that the irregularity could not be condoned. Cf Ex parte Murphy 1929 EDL 168 171, in which the failure to give the addresses of a number of debtors was condoned. Debts due by persons in a foreign country are not necessarily “bad” for these purposes (Ex parte Lamain 1921 SWA 42). The applicant need not provide the names of parties or the amounts that he paid in transactions which have already been completed, even though the transactions may stand to be impeached by the trustee (cf Ex parte Berson; Levin & Kagan v Berson 1938 WLD 107 112—13). * a list of creditors, their addresses, and particulars of each claim and any security held for it—Annexure IV;This list should mention contingent creditors, e.g., persons to whom the debtor has agreed to be liable as surety and co-principal debtor (Cumes & Co v Sacher & another 1932 WLD 213) and also, it would seem, any party who asserts that he is a creditor, even if the debtor disputes the claim (cf Van Zyl v Lloyd 1929 WLD 96 100-101). * a list of any movable assets pledged, hypothecated, subject to a lien, or under attachment in execution of a judgment—Annexure V;A description of each asset must be given, along with an estimate of its value, a description of any charge on it, the amount of the debt to which the charge relates, and the name of the creditor in whose favour the charge is. Property bought in terms of an instalment agreement governed by the National Credit Act 34 of 2005, and not yet paid for in full, should be included in this annexure. This follows from s 84(1) of the Insolvency Act. * a list and description of every accounting book used by the debtor at the time of the notice of surrender or sequestration or at the time when he ceased to carry on business—Annexure VI; * a detailed statement of the causes of the debtor's insolvency—Annexure VI; * certain personal information about the debtor, including details of any prior insolvency and rehabilitation—Annexure VIII; and * an affidavit, made by the debtor (or the person applying on his behalf), verifying that the statement of affairs is true and complete and that every estimated amount contained in it is fairly and correctly estimated.This affidavit may not be attested by the applicant’s attorney (Ex parte Du Toit 1955 (3) SA 38 (W)). The Master may, on receiving the statement of affairs, specially direct the applicant to have any property mentioned in it valued by a sworn appraiser or a person designated by the Master for this purpose (s 4(4)). The court may, when considering the application for surrender, call for an independent valuation (Ex parte Prins & another 1921 CPD 616). In the absence of any direction by the Master or the court, the debtor is not legally obliged to obtain an independent valuation in support of the values given in his statement (if he does so unnecessarily, the cost of the appraisement will not be allowed as part of the costs of the sequestration: Ex parte Kruger 1947 (2) SA 130 (SWA)), but he may effectively be compelled to do this if he relies on the anticipated proceeds of a single asset to show that sequestration will be to the advantage of creditors. In Ex parte Anthony en ‘n ander en ses soortgelyke aansoeke 2000 (4) SA 116 (C), it was held that an applicant who relies on the fact that he has immovable property which can be sold for the benefit of his creditors must include evidence from an expert proving the likely proceeds of the property in a forced sale (see also Ex parte Mattysen et uxor (First Rand Bank Ltd intervening) 2003 (2) SA 308 (T) 312; Ex parte Bouwer and similar applications (supra) 388—9; Investec Bank Ltd & another v Mutemeri & another 2010 (1) SA 265 (GSJ) 271; Naidoo & another v Matlala NO & others 2012 (1) SA 143 (GNP) 155). In the case of the simultaneous surrender of a partnership estate and the private estate of a partner, a separate statement of affairs for each estate must be prepared (see 20.1). The costs of preparing the statement of affairs are part of the costs of sequestration and are, therefore, payable out of the estate.  Lodging of statement  The statement of affairs, with supporting documents, must be lodged in duplicate at the Master's Office (s 4(3)). If the debtor resides or carries on business in a magisterial district in which there is no Master's Office, he must lodge an additional copy of the statement at the office of the magistrate of that district (s 4(5)). This latter requirement does not apply to a debtor residing in the district of Wynberg, Simonstown or Bellville in the Western Cape. The statement of affairs must lie for inspection by creditors at all times during office hours for a period of 14 days stated in the notice of surrender (s 4(6)). On expiry of the inspection period, the Master and the magistrate (where the statement has lain with him) each issues a certificate to the effect that the statement has duly lain for inspection as advertised in the notice of surrender, and whether any objections have been lodged with him by creditors. This certificate must be filed with the Registrar before the application is heard. In Ex parte Viviers et uxor (Sattar intervening) 2001 (3) SA 240 (T), the court accepted that a debtor who has already made an unsuccessful attempt to surrender his estate may lodge the same statement of affairs that he used in the earlier abortive application, provided the relevant facts and reasons for the surrender remained unchanged. In the court's view, in the absence of any provision in the Act or other authority providing a legal impediment to the same material facts being used more than once, there was no reason why the debtor could not reuse his previous statement of affairs. = Application for surrender = An application for surrender is brought by way of notice of motion, supported by affidavit. The purpose of the founding affidavit is to convince the court of the substantive requirements and show that the preliminary procedural requirements have been met. The application should be filed with the court prior to the application; the applicant may not simply turn up with it on date of application. It must be on the roll. A copy of the application must be given to the “consulting party” where the debtor is a business owner. The consulting party will usually be a trade union. The consulting party must be given a full copy of the application, not just a notice of motion. Should a creditor wish to oppose the application, he must deliver opposing affidavits prior to the hearing of the application (although they may be accepted on the day, depending on the circumstances); the debtor may then deliver replying affidavits. The court, on hearing the application, may * accept the surrender (in which case debtor is declared insolvent); * refuse the surrender (in which case the debtor is restored to his position prior to the publication of the notice of surrender, which means that the stay of execution no longer applies, and that creditors may execute against the debtor); or * postpone the matter. The court has a discretion regarding the above. Specifically, even if all the requirements are met, the court still has a discretion to refuse the application, as in the case, for example, of abuse of process, or when it will not be to the advantage of creditors, because there are not enough assets to cover the liabilities. Another example is Ex parte Logan.  Effect of notice of surrender  = Stay of sales in execution = After publication of the notice in the Government Gazette, it is unlawful for the sheriff to sell any property in the estate which has been attached under a writ of execution, or other similar process, unless the sheriff could not have known of the publication. The court may, however, order the sale of attached property to proceed if the value of the property does not exceed R5,000, and if it would be to the benefit of the creditors. Other civil proceedings may continue. For example, writs may still be granted. No period is fixed for the duration of the prohibition, but it would seem that it continues until the day that the application is adjudicated on by the court. Publication of a notice of surrender has no effect on other civil and criminal proceedings. They may proceed. Attachment of execution of judgments may be made, even though the actual sale in execution is stayed. = Curator bonis may be appointed = Notwithstanding the publication of a notice of surrender, the debtor is still at liberty to deal with his property as he chooses. He may, for example, sell it or pass a mortgage bond over it. As a safeguard against the debtor's dissipating his assets after publishing a notice of surrender, the Master may appoint a curator bonis to the debtor's estate. The idea here would be to prevent a suspicious debtor (suspicious, that is, to the Master) from dissipating his assets. The curator is then obliged to take the estate into his custody and assume control of any business or undertaking of the debtor, as the Master may direct. The estate remains vested in the debtor, since the curator is only in the position of a caretaker. He is required to open a bank account and is subject to the same provisions in this regard as a trustee. = Potential compulsory sequestration = If, after having published a notice of surrender, the debtor fails to lodge a statement of his affairs, or lodges a statement which is incorrect or incomplete in a material respect, or fails to make application to court on the appointed day, and the notice of surrender is not properly withdrawn, the debtor commits an act of insolvency which entitles a creditor to apply for the compulsory sequestration of his estate. = No withdrawal of notice without consent = A notice of surrender, published in the Government Gazette, cannot be withdrawn without the written consent of the Master. The debtor may apply to the Master for his consent, and the Master is obliged to give it if it appears to him * that the notice was published in good faith; and * that there is good cause for its withdrawal. Withdrawal takes effect upon publication of a notice of withdrawal, together with the Master's consent in the Government Gazette and in the newspaper in which the notice was published. = Lapse of notice of surrender = The notice of surrender lapses * if the court does not accept the surrender; * if the notice of surrender is properly withdrawn in terms of the Act; or * if the debtor fails to make the application for surrender within fourteen days after the date advertised as the date of the hearing of the application. If a curator bonis has been appointed to look after the debtor's assets, control of the estate must be restored to the debtor as soon as the Master is satisfied that sufficient provision has been made for the payment of all costs incurred by the curator.  Court’s discretion  Even if the court is satisfied that the requirements have been met and that the preliminary formalities observed, it still has a discretion to reject the surrender.s 6(1). The following are examples of factors that may influence the court towards refusing the application: * The debtor displayed gross extravagance and ran up debts on a pretentious scale, even after judgment had been granted against him (Ex parte Logan). * The debtor's creditors are being accommodating, not pressing him for payment, and are willing to give him time or to accept payment in monthly instalments. * The debtor had an ulterior motive in applying for surrender: for example, to avoid paying or to defeat the rights of a particular creditor (Ex parte Van den Berg). * The debtor failed to give a full and frank account of his financial position. * The debtor's papers were deficient in a number of respects (Ex parte Harmse), in which case the danger looms of costs de bonis propriis. = Compulsory sequestration = The second way in which a debtor's estate may be sequestrated is by compulsory sequestration. Whereas an application for voluntary surrender is made by the debtor himself, an application for compulsory sequestration is made by one or more creditors. To have the requisite standing to apply for such a sequestration, a creditor must have a liquidated claim of not less than R100 (or, where the application is by two or more creditors, not less than R200 in aggregate). The court may grant an application for the sequestration of a debtor's estate is it is satisfied, and the applicant creditor has proved, * that the applicant has established a claim which entitles him, in terms of section 9(1), to apply for sequestration of the debtor's estate; * that the debtor is in fact insolvent (which would require the applicant to have access to debtor's state of affairs), or has committed an \\"act of insolvency;\\" and * that there is reason to believe that it will be to the advantage of creditors of the debtor if his estate is sequestrated. The aim of the creditor in such an application is, as a rule, to obtain payment of a debt, or at least part payment. The onus of satisfying the court of these three matters rests on the sequestrating creditor: There is no onus on the debtor to disprove any element.  Locus standi  Section 9(1) allows proceedings for the compulsory sequestration of a debtor's estate to be instituted by * a creditor (or his agent) who has a liquidated claim against the debtor for not less than R100; or * two or more creditors (or their agents) who in aggregate have liquidated claims against the debtor amounting to not less than R200. The fact that a creditor holds security for his claim does not debar him from applying, even if the value of the security exceeds the amount of the claim. An agent who applies on behalf of the creditor must be authorised to do so. Lack of authority cannot be cured by ratification once the application has been launched. A liquidated claim is a monetary claim, the amount of which must be fixed by agreement or judgment.  Act of insolvency  Although a creditor may have good reason for believing the debtor is insolvent, he will usually not be in a position to prove that the debtor's liabilities exceed his assets. If, however, the creditor can establish that the debtor has committed one or more “act” of insolvency, he may seek an order sequestrating the debtor's estate without having to prove that the debtor is insolvent. Therefore, a debtor's estate may be sequestrated even though he is technically solvent. An act of insolvency need not be committed vis-à-vis the sequestrating creditor. Section 9(1) gives any creditor of the debtor the right to apply for sequestration once the debtor commits an act of insolvency—whether or not the debtor directed the act at the creditor concerned or intended it to have any bearing on that creditor's affairs. An act of insolvency committed by a spouse in a marriage in community of property operates as an act of insolvency by both spouses, and is therefore a good basis for sequestration of the joint estate. An act of insolvency may be proved and relied upon even though it is contained in a communication that would ordinarily be privileged from disclosure, such as an offer marked “without prejudice.” = Conduct designated acts of insolvency =  s 8(a): Absence from Republic or dwelling  The Act provides that a debtor has committed an act of insolvency “if he leaves the Republic or, being out of the Republic, remains absent from it, or departs from his dwelling or otherwise absents himself, with intent by doing so to evade or delay payment of his debts.” The creditor must establish the debtor's intention to evade or delay payment of his debts. Proof of departure or absence is not sufficient, because there may be other reasons (employment, for example) why he left. A factor from which the intention to evade or delay payment may be inferred is that the debtor made an appointment to make a payment and then departed without keeping it. In Abell v Strauss, Abel applied to sequestrate the estate of Strauss, a taxi driver, on the ground that he had committed an act of insolvency in terms of section 8(a), in that he had departed from his dwelling with the intention of evading or delaying the payment of his debts. The court considered that Strauss's frequent absences from his dwelling might be attributed as much to the demands of his occupation as to an intention to avoid payment. In the court's view, it could not be inferred that Strauss had committed the act of insolvency alleged. In Bishop v Baker, the creditor averred that the debtor had left South Africa with the intention of evading or delaying payment of her debts. She had sailed from Durban to New Zealand, and had sold her property and furniture before doing so. The debtor alleged that she had left because her doctor had advised her to get away to prevent her medical condition from deteriorating further. She had been constantly undergoing medical and surgical treatment since having been bitten by a dog, and was embarrassed by her disfigurement. Furthermore, her daughter lived in New Zealand. The court accepted the debtor's version. It was not satisfied that an “act of sequestration” was proved. The provisional sequestration order was accordingly discharged. In Estate Salzman v Van Rooyen, the debtor, a company director, left for another town (Cape Town) ostensibly for the purpose of visiting his wife, who had fallen ill there. Prior to his departure, however, he appointed another person as co-director to run the company business, disposed of his office equipment, and terminated the lease of the premises where he had been residing. He gave no address at which he could be contacted in Cape Town and, immediately on arriving there, resigned from his position as director. Thereafter, he ignored letters relating to business matters addressed to him. The court held that the inference was irresistible that he intended to evade payment.  s 8(b): Failure to satisfy judgment  The Act provides as follows: > If a court has given judgment against him and he fails, upon demand of the > officer whose duty it is to execute the judgment, to satisfy it or to > indicate to the officer disposable property sufficient to satisfy it, or if > it appears from the return made by the officer that he has not found > sufficient disposable property to satisfy the judgment. This subsection creates two separate acts of insolvency: * where the debtor, upon demand by the sheriff, fails to satisfy the judgment or to indicate disposable property sufficient to satisfy it; and * where the sheriff, without presenting the writ to the debtor, fails to find sufficient disposable property to satisfy the judgment and states this fact in his return. The second act applies only if the first cannot be established: that is, only if the writ cannot be served personally on the debtor. If the sheriff, on serving the writ, neglects to demand satisfaction of the writ by the debtor, and thereafter states in his return that he was unable to find sufficient disposable property, no act of insolvency is committed (Nedbank v Norton). The judgment must be against the debtor in his own name and not, for example, in the name of a firm of which he is the sole proprietor. The judgment does not have to be one obtained by the sequestrating creditor, however; a creditor may sequestrate a debtor on the basis of a nulla bona return on a writ issued at the instance of another creditor, provided the latter has not, in the interim, been paid. The demand to satisfy the judgment debt must be made of the debtor, or of his duly authorised agent. In other words, a personal service is required; a demand made to some other party, such as the debtor's wife, does not suffice.Rodrew v Rossouw. “Disposable property” includes any property which may be attached and sold in execution, either movable or immovable.  s 8(c): Disposition prejudicing creditors or preferring one creditor  The Act provides that a debtor commits an act of insolvency “if he makes, or attempts to make, any disposition of any of his property which has, or would have, the effect of prejudicing his creditors or of preferring one creditor above another.” This subsection envisages two sets of circumstances: * an actual disposition of property; and * an attempted disposition of property . If there is an actual disposition, it must have the effect of prejudicing the debtor's creditors or preferring one creditor above another. If there is an attempted disposition, it must be such that it would, if completed, have the same effect. “Disposition” is wide enough to include both a contract in which the debtor undertakes to dispose of property and the actual subsequent delivery of the property.Nahrungsmittel GmbH v Otto. Only the effect of the disposition need be considered. It does not matter whether the debtor made the disposition deliberately to favour one of his creditors, or recklessly, without regard for its consequences. The debtor's state of mind in making the disposition is irrelevant.De Villiers NO v Maursen Properties (Pty) Ltd. A debtor commits the act of insolvency where, for example, he refuses to meet one debt while paying another in full, or sells an asset manifestly below its market value while failing to meet debts that have fallen due.De Villiers NO v Maursen Properties (Pty) Ltd.  s 8(e): Offer of arrangement  A debtor commits an act of insolvency, according to the Act, “if he makes, or offers to make, any arrangement with any of his creditors for releasing him wholly or in part from his debts.” An arrangement or an offer qualifies as an act of insolvency in terms of this subsection only if it is indicative of the debtor's inability to pay his debts.Laeveldse Kooperasie Bpk v Joubert. If the debtor offers, by way of settlement, a lesser amount than that claimed, and denies liability altogether, or disputes the amount of the debt, he does not commit an act of insolvency, because it does not appear from his offer that he cannot pay the debt. On the other hand, if the debtor offers a lesser sum in settlement and expressly or by implication admits that he owes the full debt, he commits an act of insolvency, because he tacitly acknowledges that he cannot pay the debt (Laeveldse Kooperasie Bpk v Joubert). The debtor does not have to make the arrangement or offer personally. One made by a third person with his knowledge and permission suffices. The object of the arrangement or offer must be to release the debtor from liability, wholly or in part. An offer of a certain amount in the rand, subject to the debtor's being allowed an extension of time to pay the balance, does not amount to an act of insolvency.  s 8(g): Notice of inability to pay  “If he gives notice in writing to any one of his creditors that he is unable to pay any of his debts,” the debtor, according to the Act, commits an act of insolvency. The notice must be in writing. The debtor does not commit this act of insolvency by informing the creditor orally that he cannot pay his debts, although he does provide the creditor with evidence of actual insolvency. The words “any of his debts” should be interpreted as meaning that a debtor commits an act of insolvency if he gives notice of inability to pay any single debt.Court v Standard Bank of SA Ltd). The court looks to whether a reasonable person in the position of the receiver, having the same knowledge of the relevant circumstances, would have interpreted the document in question to mean that the debtor cannot pay his debts.Court v Standard Bank of SA Ltd. Unless the receiver knew, or ought to have known that the document did not truly reflect the debtor's intention, it will not avail the debtor to argue that he made an inappropriate choice of words. A typical example of this act of insolvency is where a debtor writes to a creditor informing him that he is not in a position to pay the debt for the time being, and offers to pay it in instalments.  s 8(h): Inability to pay debts after notice of transfer of business  A debtor commits an act of insolvency, in terms of this provision, “if (being a trader) he gives notice in the Gazette in terms of s 34(1) of his intention to transfer his business and is thereafter unable to pay all his debts.” Section 34(2) provides that, as soon as a notice is published every liquidated liability of the trader in connection with his business which would become due at some future date, falls due forthwith, if the creditor concerned demands payment. The term “debts” here includes debts which become immediately payable by reason of this subsection. Proof of inability to pay one debt may be accepted as proof that the debtor is unable to pay all his debts, but evidence that the debtor was unwilling or has refused to pay a particular debt is not enough to establish this act of insolvency.  Reason to believe that sequestration will be to the advantage of creditors  Before the court may grant a final order of sequestration, it must be satisfied that there is reason to believe that it will be to the advantage of creditors if the debtor's estate is sequestrated. “Creditors” means all creditors, or at least the general body of creditors.Lotzof v Raubenheimer 1959 (1) SA 90 (O). The question is whether or not a “substantial portion” of the creditors, determined according to the value of the claims, will derive advantage from sequestration. Some might not be advantaged—they might even be disadvantaged—but the bulk must not be. For sequestration to be to the advantage of creditors, it must yield “at the least a not negligible dividend.” The courts have accepted different amounts as “not negligible”—five cents in the Rand considered sufficient in one case, ten cents considered insufficient in another; in Ex Parte Ogunlaja (2011), for the North Gauteng High Court, at least 20 cent in the Rand. If, after the costs of sequestration have been met, there is no payment to creditors, or only a negligible one, there is no advantage. To enhance the size of his estate, the debtor may renounce in favour of his creditors the protection afforded by section 82(6) in respect of particular movable assets so that these assets may be sold along with the rest of his property. The fact that there will be a significant amount for distribution after the costs of sequestration have been satisfied does not necessarily mean that sequestration will be to the advantage of creditors. Sequestration is, in a sense, merely an elaborate means of execution and, because of its costs, an expensive one too. It is necessary to compare the position of creditors if there is no sequestration with their position if there is a sequestration. Sequestration will only be to the advantage of creditors if it will result in a greater dividend to them than would otherwise be the case—for example, through the setting aside of impeachable transactions, or the exposure of concealed assets—or if it will prevent an unfair division of the proceeds of the assets of some creditors being preferred to others. The court does not have to be satisfied that sequestration will benefit creditors financially, merely that there is reason to believe that it will: “The facts put before the court must satisfy it that there is a reasonable prospect—not necessarily a likelihood, but a prospect which is not too remote—that some pecuniary benefit will result to the creditors.” It is not necessary to prove that the debtor has any assets, provided it is shown either that the debtor is in receipt of an income of which substantial portions are likely to become available to creditors in terms of section 23(5), or that there is a reasonable prospect that the trustee, by invoking the machinery of the Act, will unearth or recover assets which will yield a pecuniary benefit for creditors. The onus of establishing advantage to creditors remains on the sequestrating creditor throughout, even where it is clear that the debtor has committed an act of insolvency.  Friendly sequestration  There is nothing to prevent a debtor from having his estate sequestrated by an amicable creditor. The debtor may, for instance, arrange with a friend to whom he owes a debt, and whom he is unable to pay, that he (the debtor) will commit an act of insolvency. (He will, for instance, write a letter saying that he cannot meet the debt.) The friend will then apply for compulsory sequestration on the strength of this act of insolvency. An application for compulsory sequestration brought by a creditor who is not at arm's length is generally referred to as “friendly” sequestration. The mere fact that an application for compulsory sequestration is brought by a creditor who is prepared to co-operate with the debtor, or who is motivated partly by a desire to assist the debtor, does not preclude the granting of a sequestration order. An order should not be refused simply because there is goodwill between the parties. The court must be mindful, however, that, where debtor and creditor in sequestration proceedings are not at arm's length, there is considerable potential for collusion and malpractice. Collusion consists of an agreement between the parties to suppress facts or manufacture evidence in order to make it appear to the court that one of the parties has a cause of action or a defence. Examples of malpractices that typically arise in friendly sequestrations are * reliance on a non-existent claim; * inclusion of protected assets; * overvaluation of assets; * underestimation of costs, in order to convince the court that a significant dividend will be payable; and * repeated extensions of the return date for final sequestration. A friendly sequestration application may be brought with the sole purpose of obtaining a stay in execution. The debtor resorts to a friendly compulsory sequestration rather than voluntary surrender to achieve the stay because the former procedure is better suited to his purpose. It may be obtained on an urgent basis and without preliminary formalities or advance notice to creditors. It involves a less strenuous onus. The result of the application is, initially, only a provisional order which must be served on the debtor and may be postponed and subsequently discharged at the instance of the sequestrating creditor. A debtor may even use a friendly sequestration as a method of freeing himself entirely from his debts. The courts have accepted that they must, as a matter of policy, scrutinise every friendly sequestration with particular care to ensure that the requirements of the Act are not subverted, and that the interests of creditors are not prejudiced. In particular, the court should require in each case the following from the sequestrating creditor: * full details of his claim; * documentary evidence establishing that he has actually performed as alleged; and * full details of the debtor's realisable assets.  Application for sequestration  Prior to the adjudication on the application, the applicant must furnish a copy of the application to the debtor. The court may, in its discretion, dispense with this requirement and make a provisional order of sequestration without advance notice to the debtor if it is satisfied that this would be in the interest of creditors or of the debtor. One suggestion is that the court would be justified in dispensing with prior notice only in cases of urgency, where there is a reasonable likelihood of irreparable loss to the application if the debtor is forewarned of the impending application. It is no longer permissible for a court to grant a provisional order ex parte merely because the applicant has clear documentary evidence, such as a nulla bona return.Stride v Castelein.  Court’s discretion  Even if the court is satisfied that the requirements have been established on a balance of probabilities, it is not bound to grant a final order of sequestration: * The debtor might produce independent evidence that he is, in fact, solvent. * The debtor might have counter claim against creditor. * The creditor might have had ulterior motives. (It is not only the sneakiness of debtors that matters, therefore. The court must uphold justice and fairness on both sides.) In each case, the court has an overriding discretion, to be exercised upon a consideration of all the circumstances. The court may, therefore, exercise its discretion against sequestration, notwithstanding proof of an act of insolvency and the other requirements.  Effects of sequestration order  The chief effects of a sequestration order are * to divest the insolvent of all his assets; and * to deprive the insolvent of full contractual capacity. Other consequences include criminal liability on the part of the insolvent for certain acts committed both before and during sequestration. The insolvent may also obtain relief from the effects of certain legal proceedings. = Deprivation of property = The insolvent is divested of all his estate: that is, all the property he owned at the date of sequestration and that he may acquire during the sequestration—except such property as the insolvent is entitled to retain as a separate estate. \\"Property\\" in this context is defined to include \\"movable or immovable property wherever situate in South Africa.\\"Insolvency Act 24 of 1936, s 2. It includes a right of action, unless the action is one that the insolvent is permitted to institute. It also includes property that is, or the proceeds of property that are, in the hands of a sheriff under a writ of attachment. The insolvent's property includes contingent interests in property, other than the contingent interests of a fideicommissary heir or legatee. This estate vests in one or two trustees who are elected by the creditors, and whose appointment is confirmed by the Master of the High Court. The trustee acquires the dominium of the entire estate, but such ownership is merely a nuda proprietas. The trustee does not obtain any beneficial interest in the property. The trustee is, in a sense, the agent of the persons in fact beneficially interested in the estate: namely, * the creditors; and, * in the event that there is a surplus after satisfaction of the creditors' claims, the insolvent, who has a residuary interest in the estate. It is the trustee's duty to collect and liquidate the estate assets, and to distribute the proceeds among the estate creditors, giving preference to the secured creditors and certain preferred creditors, and dividing the balance, if any, termed the \\"free residue,\\" proportionately among the unsecured or concurrent creditors. If any surplus remains after the costs of sequestration have been paid, and after all creditors have been satisfied, it is returned to the insolvent. Where the joint estate of spouses married in community of property is sequestrated, both spouses are divested of the joint estate and each of any separate assets falling outside the joint estate. If the insolvent is married out of community of property and the spouses are not living apart under a judicial order of separation, then on sequestration the solvent spouse's property also vests in the insolvent's trustee as if it were the insolvent's property. The solvent spouse may reclaim such property as he proves to be his own property. Until such property is released by the trustee pursuant to such claim, the solvent spouse does not have the usual powers of ownership. A court may, either at the time of granting the sequestration order or at a later stage, exclude the solvent spouse's property from the operation of the sequestration on certain grounds.  Property falling within the estate  What falls within the estate? Subject to certain exceptions flowing from the Act, the insolvent estate comprises the following: * all property of the insolvent at the date of sequestration, including property (or the proceeds thereof) in the hands of a sheriff under a writ of attachment; and * all property which the insolvent acquires or which accrues to him during the sequestration, including any property that the insolvent recovers for the benefit of the estate where the trustee fails to take the necessary action. In terms of section 2, “property” means movable or immovable property wherever situate in the Republic, and includes contingent interests in property. Assets situated outside the Republic are not included—even though, if the debtor is domiciled within the jurisdiction of the court, the sequestration order divests him of all his movable property, wherever situated. Whenever an insolvent has acquired possession of property which is claimed by the trustee, it is deemed to belong to the insolvent estate, unless the contrary is proved. If, however, a person who became a creditor of the insolvent after sequestration alleges that a particular asset does not belong to the estate, and claims a right to the asset, it is deemed not to belong to the estate unless the contrary is proved. Sequestration of a joint estate makes both spouses “insolvent debtors” for the purposes of the Act, with the consequence that the property of both of them (comprising their shares in the joint estate, as well as separately-owned property) vests in the trustee and is available to meet the claims of creditors.Du Plessis v Pienaar NO. Thus, property inherited by a spouse to a marriage in community of property forms part of the insolvent estate, even if the will contains a provision specifically excluding the property from any community of property. Property inherited by an insolvent during his insolvency falls into his insolvent estate, notwithstanding a contrary provision in the testator's will.Vorster v Steyn NO. However, if an insolvent refuses to accept property bequeathed to him or an insurance benefit of which he has been nominated as a beneficiary, the property or benefit in question does not vest in his estate. The reason is that the insolvent merely has a competence or power to accept the bequest or nomination, and he acquires no right to the property or benefit until he has accepted. An insolvent may, thus, by repudiating a legacy, inheritance or insurance benefit, ensure that it passes to someone other than the trustee and the creditors of his insolvent estate. The property of the spouse of the insolvent, where the marriage is out of community of property, also vests in the trustee of the insolvent estate, until it is released by the trustee.s 21. Also forming part of insolvent estate are liquor licenses and rights of action (not personal). = Status = Sequestration of a debtor's estate imposes on him a form of reduction in status, which curtails his capacity to contract, to earn a living, to litigate and to hold office. The Act does not deprive the debtor of his contractual capacity generally; he retains a general competency to make binding agreements. The insolvent may validly enter into any contract, * provided that he does not purport to dispose of any of the assets in the insolvent estate; and * provided that he may not, without the written consent of the trustee, conclude any contract that is likely to affect adversely the insolvent estate. To protect creditors, the Act imposes certain restrictions on the debtor's capacity to contract. Sequestration, then, does affect contractual capacity where it will affect the insolvent estate by * disposing of any property in the insolvent estate; * diminishing the value of his estate in any way; or * affecting the contribution that the trustee may require the insolvent to make.  Prohibited contracts  The debtor may not make a contract which purports to dispose of any property of his insolvent estate.s 23(2). Furthermore, he may not, without the written consent of the trustee, enter into a contract which adversely affects his estate or any contribution which he is obliged to make towards his estate. That contribution is what is claimable by the trustee in terms of section 23(5) from moneys earned by the insolvent in the course of his profession, occupation or employment. The contribution becomes due to the trustee only once the Master has expressed the opinion that the moneys in question are not necessary for the support of the insolvent and his dependents. It follows that, prior to the Master's assessment of a contribution, the insolvent need not obtain the trustee's consent to enter into the contract. If a person avers that a particular contract with an insolvent is invalid for any reason, he must set out the facts on which he bases his allegation. Where the trustee's consent is not necessary (or where it is, and is given), the contract is valid and binding on the parties. Although the contract is binding, the insolvent may not enforce performance in his favour unless the Act specifically gives him the right to do so. In the absence of an empowering statutory provision, the trustee is the proper person to enforce the claim. Thus, for example, the insolvent cannot compel payment of money due in terms of a post-sequestration partnership entered into with the trustee's consent, since there is no statutory provision which entitles him to recover for his own benefit money due under a partnership. Only the trustee can demand this payment. On the other hand, the insolvent may enforce payment for work done after sequestration because section 23(9) expressly gives him the right to recover this remuneration for his own benefit. A contract made by the insolvent without the trustee's consent, where such consent is necessary, is not void, but it is voidable at the instance of the trustee. This is subject to the qualification that, if an insolvent purports to alienate, for valuable consideration, and without the consent of the trustee of the insolvent estate, any property acquired after sequestration, or right to such property to a person who proves that he was not aware and had no reason to suspect that the estate of the insolvent was under sequestration, the alienation shall nevertheless be valid. The insolvent may follow any profession or occupation, and enter into any employment—except that he may not, without the written consent of the trustee, carry on, or be employed in, the business of a trader who is a general dealer or manufacturer. The insolvent may not, save under authority of a court, be a director of a company. If the insolvent enters a contract which purports to dispose of estate property, the contract is voidable at the option of the trustee; it is not void. The position is the same if the insolvent contracts without obtaining his trustee's consent where it is required. Should the trustee choose not to set aside the contract, or simply to stand by without avoiding it, the contract remains valid and binding on all parties. However, as in the case of a contract which does not require consent, or to which consent has been given, the insolvent cannot sue for performance unless there is a statutory provision giving him the right to enforce for his own benefit performance under that type of contract. If the trustee elects to set aside a contract, he may recover any performance rendered by the insolvent, but he must restore to the third party any benefits that the insolvent has received under the transaction. The insolvent may sue or be sued in his own name in any matter relating to status or to any right not affecting his estate, and may claim damages for defamation or personal injury.  Earning a livelihood  Nobody wants the insolvent to be destitute. The insolvent, therefore, is allowed to follow any profession or occupation, and to enter into any contracts related thereto. The insolvent, however, requires the consent of the trustee in order to carry on the business of a trader or manufacturer. If the trustee refuses this permission, the insolvent may appeal to the Master. Why? Because of the disposition of assets: If your business is buying and selling, the trustee's work is made very difficult.  Legal proceedings  The following types of proceedings may be brought personally by the insolvent: * matters relating to status; * matters which do not affect the insolvent estate; * claims to recover remuneration for work done; * a claim for a pension; * delictual claims for defamation and for personal injury; and * delicts committed by the insolvent after sequestration. As for costs, there is a distinction to be made between costs in the Magistrate's Court and costs in the High Court: * Magistrate's Court proceedings require security for costs. * High Court proceedings do not, unless the matter appears to be vexatious or reckless. The court has a discretion. If the insolvent is awarded costs, they are his to dispose of as he so chooses.  Holding office  An unrehabilitated insolvent is disqualified from being * a trustee in an insolvent estate;If you cannot handle own affairs, you probably will not manage too well with others’. The same rationale, apparently, applies to the offices below. The disqualification in some cases has been argued to be unfair. What they have in common, however, is that all are positions of trust or responsibility. The insolvent is thought of as falling short on this score. * a member of parliament, the National Council of Provinces, or a provincial legislature; * a director of company or managing member of a closed corporation (without the permission of the court); * a member of the governing board of the National Credit Regulator (for obvious reasons); * a business rescue practitioner (for much the same reason); * a board member of the Land Bank; * an attorney or estate agent with a fidelity-fund certificate—unless he can show that he is still fit and proper;An attorney, therefore, is not necessarily suspended if he becomes insolvent, but in all likelihood that is what will happen. An insolvent may be an advocate, however, since an advocate does not have a trust account. * a registered manufacturer or distributor of liquor; and, * possibly, an executor of a deceased estate, or, again possibly, the trustee of a trust. (What the “possibilities” here refer to is the discretion of the Master.) = Acquisition of separate estate = During sequestration, the insolvent may acquire certain assets that do not vest in the insolvent estate, such as * remuneration for work done or professional services rendered; * a pension; * damages for defamation or personal injury; * certain insurance benefits; and * a share in an accrual. In that way the insolvent may acquire an estate separate from the sequestrated estate. That separate estate may in turn be sequestrated.  Vesting of estate in trustee  The function of the trustee is * to collect the assets in the estate; * to realise (or better say to sell) them; and * to distribute the proceeds among the creditors in the order of preference laid down by the Act. To enable the trustee to do this, the Act provides that the effect of a sequestration order is to divest the insolvent of his estate and vest it in the Master, and thereafter the trustee, once he has been appointed. If a provisional trustee is appointed, the estate vests in him before vesting in the trustee. The estate remains vested in the trustee until * the discharge of the sequestration order by the court; * the acceptance by creditors of an offer of composition made by the insolvent which provides that the insolvent's property will be restored to him; or * an order for the insolvent's rehabilitation is granted in terms of section 124(3). If a trustee vacates his office, is removed from office or dies, the estate re-vests in the Master until a new trustee is appointed. If there is a co-trustee, the estate remains vested in him. = Criminal liability = An insolvent is liable to imprisonment for a number of acts committed before sequestration, which, if committed by a solvent person, would not constitute crimes: for example, failing to keep proper books, or diminishing his assets by gambling, betting or hazardous speculations. Further, an insolvent is criminally liable for certain specified acts committed during sequestration, such as obtaining credit to an amount exceeding R20 without informing the creditor that he is insolvent. = Relief to insolvent = If the insolvent is in prison for debt when declared insolvent, he may apply to court for release. The court has a discretion in this regard. In terms of the Abolition of Civil Imprisonment Act,Act 2 of 1977. no court shall have the power to order the civil imprisonment of a debtor for failure to pay a sum of money in terms of any judgment. This Act does not, however, affect the power of a court to grant an order for the committal of any person for contempt of court or to sentence a judgment debtor to imprisonment in terms of any provision of the Magistrates' Courts ActAct 32 of 1944. for failing to satisfy the judgment. On sequestration, civil proceedings by or against an insolvent relating to property that falls into the insolvent estate are stayed until the appointment of a trustee. A further consequence of a sequestration order is that the execution on any judgment against the insolvent is stayed unless the court otherwise directs.  Rehabilitation  An insolvent's status as such is terminated by rehabilitation. A court may grant a rehabilitation order on application by the insolvent within a comparatively short time of the sequestration, where the claims have been paid in full or where an offer of composition has been accepted by the creditors and payment has been made of at least 50 cents in the rand on all claims. Otherwise, periods varying from twelve months to five years must have elapsed. These periods vary according to whether or not claims have been proved, whether or not the insolvent's estate has been sequestrated previously, and whether or not the insolvent has been convicted of any fraudulent act of insolvency. A rehabilitation order has the effect of putting an end to the sequestration of the debtor's estate, of discharging all the insolvent's debts due before sequestration, and of relieving the insolvent of every disability resulting from the sequestration. Rehabilitation does not, however, affect * the rights of the trustee or of creditors under a composition; * the powers or duties of the Master or the duties of the trustee in connection with a composition; * the right of the trustee or creditors to any part of the insolvent's estate which is vested in but has not yet been distributed by the trustee; * the liability of a surety for the insolvent; or * the liability of any person to pay any penalty or suffer any punishment imposed under the Act. Where an insolvent has not been rehabilitated by order of court within ten years from the date of sequestration, the insolvent is deemed to be rehabilitated automatically after that period unless a court orders otherwise before the expiry of the period of ten years.  Administration orders  Administration orders are granted in terms of the Magistrates’ Court Act. They have been described as a modified form of sequestration. This procedure is applicable to debtors with small incomes and few assets, where the costs of sequestration would exhaust the assets in the estate, so that the aim of the order is to assist debtors over a period of financial embarrassment without the need for sequestration of the debtor's estate. Where a debtor whose debts do not exceed an amount determined by the Minister from time to time, by notice in the Gazette, cannot pay a judgment debt immediately, or is unable to satisfy his debts and has insufficient assets capable of attachment in execution, a magistrate may, on application of the debtor or under section 651 of the Magistrates' Courts Act, make an order, subject to such conditions as the court deems fit, providing for the administration of the debtor's estate and for the payment of his debts in instalments or otherwise. The administrator appointed must, among other duties, collect payments due to the debtor and distribute those, at least once a quarter, pro rata among the debtor's creditors, subject to any preference claims being paid in the legal order of preference.
