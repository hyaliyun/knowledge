Produced by Wheeler- Sussman Productions and distributed by Hearst-Argyle Television, the program was taped at the studios of WCVB-TV in Boston. The series was offered as one of two series named Pressure in an hour-long block. Its companion series, Pressure 2, was actually heavily edited reruns of the 1997-98 game show Peer Pressure. Gameplay Unlike its parent show, Pressure 1 was based on general trivia. The only similarities between the two were the shared logo and theme song. At the end of each round, a clip was shown of the eliminated player telling the viewers their most embarrassing moment, referred to as the \\"Wall of Shame\\". Round 1 (Four's a Crowd) The four contestants competed in answering questions, with the round ending after three of the four players had each correctly answered two questions; the remaining player was eliminated (hence the round's name). Round 2 (Take That!) The remaining three players competed in another round of questions, which began with the first player to win a spot in that round choosing one of two possible categories to answer a question in, then giving the remaining category to his/her opponents for them to buzz in and answer. The player that answered correctly would then be given a choice of two categories to play, with the other two players trying their luck at the remaining category, and so on for the remainder of the round. Correct answers were worth 10 points each, and when time expired, the lowest-scoring contestant was eliminated. Round 3 (Pressure Cooker) After the end of general play, the two finalists would face off in a \\"lightning round\\" in which they had to answer five questions in 60 seconds. Whoever answered them in the fastest time, or whoever answered the most questions correctly, won the game and a prize package. Both players received the same questions; the contestant playing second was sequestered in an isolation booth so that he could not hear the questions or answers.

Breen, which began July 1, 1934. Plot Upperworld tells the story of Alexander Stream (Warren William), a wealthy railroad tycoon, who is devoted to his wife (Mary Astor), has an affair with a chorus girl (Ginger Rogers), which leads to blackmail and murder. Alexander (Alex) Stream is a multimillionaire. While he is devoted to his wife, Hettie (Astor) and son, Tommy (Dickie Moore), she is too busy playing attending and throwing society functions to pay much attention to her husband. While out in his yacht, he encounters a young woman, Lilly Linda (Rogers) who is drowning in the ocean. The crew throws her a life preserver and pulls her out of the water, gets her a towel and loans her some of his clothes. He gives her a ride home in his limousine and she invites him to come in so she can give the clothes back to him. To thank him, she offers to make him breakfast and he ends up skipping all of his morning appointments to have breakfast with her. On the way to his appointments, his car is stopped for speeding by Officer Moran (Sidney Toler), an incorruptible law-and-order beat cop. Alex pulls some strings and gets Moran demoted. When Alex gets back home, his wife is in the middle of throwing a large costume party. She asks him to come to the party, and Alex tells her that he misses spending time alone with her. Hettie replies that maintaining her social position is as important to her as his career is to him. Alex declines putting in an appearance at the party and instead plays with Tommy. The next day, he makes dinner reservations at an expensive restaurant and special arrangements for a cake for his and Hattie's 14th wedding anniversary. When he calls Hettie to invite her to meet him in the city for dinner, she tells him she can't make it because she has other dinner plans already. As his driver is taking him home, Alex sees a picture of Linda, showing she is headlining a burlesque show. Afterwards, he stops backstage to invite her to share the anniversary dinner with him. At dinner she realizes that he asked her because his wife wasn't able to come. After an innocent dinner, Oscar, his driver (Andy Devine) brings him home and he and Alex discuss that neither of them will tell anyone about his dinner with Lilly. The next morning, he wakes up and finds that his wife has made arrangements to send Tommy to a sleep-away summer camp 200 miles away. He expresses his displeasure but Hettie reminds him that it's necessary for their social position. After Tommy leaves, Hettie tells Alex that she's going away for two weeks with some of her society friends. Feeling depressed and at loose ends, Alex makes another date with Lilly to go for a ride in his airplane. In the meantime, Lilly's manager and boyfriend, Louie Colima (J. Carrol Naish) is encouraging her to have an affair with Alex so the two of them can blackmail him. After a minor accident, Lilly and Alex kiss. A few months later, Alex has put Lilly in an luxury apartment and purchases a $12,000 diamond bracelet for her birthday. On the way to dinner, Hettie finds the gift box while straightening Alex's tie and assumes it's for her. In the meantime, Louie tells Lilly that it's time to blackmail Alex and breaks open her bedroom door and slaps her to the ground when she refuses to give him the letters. He picks up a gun that Lilly pointed at him and tosses it in a chair on his way to the door. At the door he comes face to face with Alex who tells him that he and Lilly were planning to blackmail him all along. Lilly comes into the room and is clearly upset because she is sincerely in love with him. Alex demands that Lou give him the letters and in the ensuring tussle, Lou fires his gun at Alex but kills Lilly instead. When his gun jams, Alex picks up the gun Lou tossed in the chair and kills him. He makes the shootings look like a murder-suicide and erases evidence that he was there. When he gets home, Hettie is waiting for him to tell him that not only is she bringing Tommy home from military school but that she realizes that she has been ignoring him and wants to spend more time together. Unbeknownst to Alex, Moran, now walking the beat, saw his car parked illegally in front of Lilly's building and watched him drive away. While everyone else is saying it's a murder suicide, Moran puts the pieces together and believes that someone else committed the murders. When the murders become front-page news, Alex goes to the building and pays off the maintenance man to say that he never saw him come to the building. By this point, Moran is suspicious that Alex is the killer so he contrives to get Alex's fingerprints to compare them against the fingerprints found in the apartment. When he brings this to the detectives, he finds out that they have been paid off. He causes a scene in the office and the chief of detectives has him taken to jail. The reporters follow him to the jail cell because he has been yelling that Alex is involved with the murder. Several reporters show up with a fingerprint technician at Alex's house where he is having a large party to announce his acquisition of another railroad company. When they come in, they demand that he give them his fingerprints to clear his name. When he can't find a way out of it, Alex submits his prints knowing they will match prints found in Lilly's apartment. After giving his fingerprints, he returns to the party. The technician has compared the fingerprints while waiting in the hallway and when they match, the policemen who accompanied them arrest him for murder. When the press crashes through the door asking him for a statement, Alex tells the assembled company that he is being arrested and charged with murder. While waiting for the verdict to come back, he is summoned to the judge's chambers and finds that Hettie and Tommy are there. Hettie tells him that they are leaving for Europe the next day and she wanted to give him a chance to say goodbye to Tommy. She tells him that she could forgive him if it weren't for the affair. He responds by telling her that he was very lonely. He tells Hettie that while he was fond of Lilly, he still loves Hettie and her constant unavailability made him lonely enough to reach out to someone else for the attention he wasn't getting at home. He returns to the courtroom where the jury verdict is beginning to be read. The scene cuts to a ship. Tommy is talking to Oscar about traveling to England. The camera draws back to show Alex sitting next to Hettie on the deck. Alex was acquitted. This trip is a second honeymoon, and the two of them vow to always take time for each other and their marriage.

On the 29th, he got a confirmed win but had a second one not confirmed. He switched squadrons to Jagdstaffel 18. Between 27 March and 13 September, he shot down and destroyed five more opponents. Between 9:00 and 9:15 AM on 14 September, M√ºller shot down three Spad XIIIs from the American 13th Aero Squadron . At 2:40 PM that same afternoon, he shot down a fourth Spad from that same squadron. A week later, he finished his tally with one last Spad. Post World War I Hans M√ºller, at some point, had a neighbor with that identical name. The aviator changed his last name to Garrelt to obviate confusion in their mail delivery.The Aerodrome website http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/germany/muller1.php Retrieved on 15 April 2010 During World War II, M√ºller served on the staff of Luftflotte 3 of the Luftwaffe. Post World War II, he designed steam locomotives for Hanomag and Henschel. He died of a brain tumor in 1964.

Iwan Iwanoff studied architecture in Europe before arriving in Perth to work as an architect. He became renowned for his design characteristic which is mainly working with concrete blocks. Biography=Early years and education Iwan Iwanoff was born in Bulgaria into an artistic family, with his father, Nickolai Iwanow, a journalist and a poet, and his mother, Maria, n√©e Schopowa. Originally named Iwan Nickolow Iwanow, he changed it to Iwan Nickoloff Iwanoff during his educational years, and shortened it later to Iwan Iwanoff. After enduring a period of training in the military, Iwan Iwanoff studied fine arts under a famous Bulgarian Watercolourist and was himself a fine painter. As a result of his talents, he was offered a scholarship to study Fine Arts . In 1941, thanks to his father's advice, he made a decision to study architecture at the Technische Hochschule of Munich, Germany. He designed an outstanding chapel for the final project which brought him high praise when graduating with a Diploma of Engineering and Architecture in 1946. With his remarkable abilities in drawings and innovation in expressing his design, Iwan Iwanoff soon became a well known architect and his concept was that \\"architecture was an art\\".Black, R (2006). \\"Eastern Block, Monument: Architecture quarterly , 73 (52-56). He married Dietlinde Hildegunde Zenns on 25 October 1947 in Laufen, Germany. Working life Iwan Iwanoff worked in Laufen as a caricature painter in the immediate post-war period before working with Emil Freymuth, a modernist architect in Munich, Germany. Leaving Germany with the help of the International Refugee Organization, Iwan Iwanoff and his wife left Europe on the SS Fairsea which left Naples on the 7th of February 1950, and settled in Fremantle, Western Australia on 2 March 1950. His Munich qualifications were not recognised in Australia. But shortly after, he gained employment under Krantz and Sheldon as a draftsperson. Krantz and Sheldon were a large commercial architectural company which had a major focus on designing flats in Perth. Iwanoff did some private architectural projects during this time. He became a citizen of Australia in 1956. He obtained a transfer to the Melbourne architectural firm of Yuncken, Freeman Bros, Griffiths & Simpson in 1960. He transferred to Melbourne with the help of an old friend from Bulgaria, who himself had studied with Iwan and had emigrated to Australia. The reason for his brief stay in Melbourne, was to obtain registration, after several unsuccessful attempts in Western Australia. After visiting Western Germany, he briefly joined Bund Deutscher Architekten Organization (Federation of German Architects) before returning to Perth, to work with Krantz & Sheldon, in December 1961. In 1963, he started his own business which was known as The Studio of Iwanoff [in Perth]. He had become a member of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects in 1963 and soon became a fellow in 1972. He was interested in exploring concrete blocks in various ways which allowed him to create high quality designs, especially in houses. Although he has been described as working in the Brutalist style, this only reflects the sui generis nature of his work and the difficulty of fitting him into recognised architectural genres. While he favoured the aesthetic effect of unadorned concrete blocks, giving his buildings a superficial resemblance to concrete brutalist works, he had nothing to do with the brutalist ethic of prioritising and emphasizing the structural and functional aspects of architecture over its aesthetic side. Rather than eschewing art and aesthetics as the brutalists at least claimed to, Iwanoff remained an artist throughout his life, and took great care in deciding just how far individual blocks should protrude or recede, sometimes arranging them with his own hands on site during construction. His intention was not to push a theory or reject tradition but to embody what he saw as the timeless traditions of art in contemporary form. Indeed, his emphasis on ornamentation and his playfulness with texture, light and shade place him, if anything, in the Rococo tradition, one at polar opposities to the spare modernism of his time and place. A precursor of post- modernism and what some now call the New Baroque (Gehry, et al.), he was consequently misunderstood and ignored by his contemporaries, while beloved by a small artistically educated or intrigued following. Only in recent years has the Perth architecture profession begun to appreciate what Iwanoff was about, and what a unique artist had operated in their midst. Iwan Iwanoff still kept the European spirit during the time he was working in Australia. He died in Perth on 7 October 1986. His body was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery. An exhibition of most of his works was presented at the State Archives of Western Australia in 1991.

During the 1890s he was an Instructor in architecture at the Working Men's College (now RMIT University) where he founded the T-Square in 1900. The club acted as a meeting point for Melbourne‚Äôs architects, artists and craft workers and helped to develop a strong Arts and Crafts culture in the city. Desbrowe-Annear was also a supporter of the Victorian Arts and Crafts Society, founded in 1908. Personal life=Early life and education Born in Happy Valley, Bendigo, Victoria in 1865, Desbrowe-Annear was the elder son of James Annear, mining contractor, and Eliza Ann (n√©e Hawkins). He had six older stepsisters, two sisters and a brother. After the family moved to Melbourne in 1875 Desbrowe-Annear attended Hawthorn Grammar School, matriculating in 1882. On 25 July 1891, he married Florence Susan Chadwick but by the end of World War I, due to irreconcilable differences, they had separated. Practices In 1883, Desbrowe-Annear was articled to Melbourne architect William Salway and during this time his interest and knowledge of architecture grew extensively. In 1889 he chose to pursue a practice of his own having already received recognition for his architectural sketches and papers delivered to the Victorian Institute of Architects. During the 1890s he became an advocate of the Arts and Crafts movement and he established the T-Square Club on an Arts and Crafts agenda of collaborative work and the promotion of the building crafts. He was sympathetic to the theory of a 'democratic architecture' which underpins his most recognised work, the Eaglemont houses (1903) as well as his journal For Every Man his Home (1922) which expressed the idea of domestic Australian architecture suitable for everyone. Death Desbrowe-Annear died on 22 June 1933 of heart disease; he was survived by Florence, whom he had not divorced, and their two sons James and Hector. The Harold Desbrowe- Annear Award In 1996, The Royal Australian Institute of Architects introduced the Harold Desbrowe-Annear Award to the best residential project of the year in Victoria. It is the highest honour in the state for Residential Architecture. Notable projects 36‚Äì38 The Eyrie Federation Arch, Princes Bridge 1901 The ephemeral triumphal arch erected on Princes Bridge by the City of Melbourne was designed by Desbrowe-Annear in 1901 to mark the visit of the Duke and Duchess of York for the Federation celebrations. It was influenced by Beaux-Arts civic design and the 'Arc de Triomphe' in Paris. Chadwick Houses, Eaglemont 1903 The three houses that Desbrowe-Annear erected in Eaglemont were commissioned by his father-in-law James Chadwick in 1903. They were 36‚Äì38 The Eyrie, built as a residence for the architect and his family; 32‚Äì34 The Eyrie, known as Chadwick House and 55 Outlook Drive, known as the Officer House. While relatively modest in size, their design indicates that the architect was prepared to grasp the issue of the \\"small home\\" as one of the most challenging of the 20th century. They embody the principles of William Morris in their truth to materials and place, structural 'honesty', functionalism and celebration of the builder's craft. They are weatherboard with rough cast and half-timbering and exhibit many technological innovations including wall recessed, sliding window sashes, modular wall- framing and convection heating vents to fireplaces. Each house was thoughtfully positioned on the slope of the hill, with increasing setbacks from the street, so as not to block the views from within. Springthorpe Memorial, Booroondara Cemetery, Kew, 1897‚Äì1900 Springthorpe Memorial, Booroondara Cemetery The Springthorpe Memorial in the Boroondara Cemetery, Kew, was Desbrowe-Annear's first Arts and Crafts venture. The design was influenced by William Lethaby‚Äôs writings on the iconography of the domed temple form in ‚ÄúArchitecture: Mysticism & Myth‚Äù. Consequentially the architecture is symbolic. The geographic alignment of the tomb ascertains that the intense light of the afternoon sun lights up the temple with brilliant colour. It explores the idea of the hoped-for union of souls. Inglesby, South Yarra 1915 Inglesby, also called the Francis house, in South Yarra was one of Desbrowe-Annear's most famous houses, identified by Robin Boyd as an example of Melbourne's 'pioneer modernism'. It was timber-framed with plain white roughcast walls inspired by Californian architect Irving Gill. The plan of Inglesby centred on a large hall entered from the porch. It was flanked either side by the dining room and the living room accessed through sliding doors which when opened extended into a huge living area across the front of the house. Inglesby's low ceilings and horizontal flow aligned it also to the work of Frank Lloyd Wright. Heritage listed residential houses *Allanvale, Allanvale Road, Great Western, Northern Grampians Shire.

It does not bind to the norepinephrine or dopamine transporter nor to the sigma œÉ receptor (Ki >10,000 nM). Based on its structural similarity to 3-hydroxy-PCP (3-HO- PCP), which uniquely among arylcyclohexylamines has high affinity for the Œº-opioid receptor in addition to the NMDA receptor, it was initially expected that 3-MeO-PCP would have opioid activity. However, radioligand binding assays with human proteins have shown that, contrary to common belief, the drug also does not interact with the Œº-, Œ¥-, or Œ∫-opioid receptors at concentrations of up to 10,000 nM. As such, the notion that 3-MeO-PCP has opioid activity has been described as a myth. 3-MeO-PCP binds to the NMDA receptor with higher affinity than PCP and has the highest affinity of the three isomeric anisyl- substitutions of PCP, followed by 2-MeO-PCP and 4-MeO-PCP. Chemistry 3-MeO-PCP hydrochloride is a white crystalline solid with a melting point of 204‚Äì205 ¬∞C. History 3-MeO-PCP was first synthesized in 1979 to investigate the structure‚Äìactivity relationships of phencyclidine (PCP) derivatives. The effects of 3-MeO-PCP in humans were not described until 1999 when a chemist using the pseudonym John Q. Beagle wrote that 3-MeO-PCP was qualitatively similar to PCP with comparable potency. 3-MeO-PCP was preceded by the less potent dissociative 4-MeO-PCP and first became available as a research chemical in 2011. Society and culture=Legal statusUnited Kingdom= On October 18, 2012 the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs in the United Kingdom released a report about methoxetamine, saying that the \\"harms of methoxetamine are commensurate with Class B of the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971)\\". The report went on to suggest that all analogues of MXE should also become class B drugs and suggested a catch-all clause covering both existing and unresearched arylcyclohexylamines, including 3-MeO-PCP. =United States= 3-MeO-PCP is not a controlled substance in the United States but possession or distribution of 3-MeO-PCP for human use could potentially be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act due to its structural and pharmacological similarities to PCP. =Sweden= Sweden's public health agency suggested classifying 3-MeO-PCP as hazardous substance on November 10, 2014. =Czech Republic= 3-MeO-PCP is banned in the Czech Republic. =Chile= As per Chile's Ley de drogas, aka Ley 20000, all esters and ethers of PCP are illegal.

It is located in the Rockcliffe Park area of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. History Lornado on July 4, 2015 The home was built in 1908 for Warren Y. Soper, an American-born, Ottawa-based industrialist. Soper was the co-founder of the Ottawa Electric Railway Company‚ÄîOttawa's first public transit system‚Äîand the Ottawa Car Company. Lornado was built on the Soper family cottage property. In homage to one of his favorite novels, Lorna Doone, Soper named the property \\"Lornado,\\" a name it has kept to this day. The United States government purchased the property from the Soper family in 1935. From 1935 to 1938, the mansion was slightly modified by the Department of State, but it still maintains many of its Edwardian influences. Despite modernization and refurbishing projects over the years, the interior of Lornado has retained its architectural integrity and much of its original decor. The home still uses some of its original heirloom furnishings and features original artwork on loan from American artists. The 32-room, -story limestone manor commands a central place on the grounds of the property. The property encompasses ten acres of grounds, including manicured lawns and landscaped gardens, a greenhouse, maintenance buildings, and a gatehouse. Ornamental shelters located below Lornado and several other houses along the Rockcliffe Park Driveway testify to Soper's company's streetcar line, which once traveled this route. Access to the home is via Rockcliffe Road, a restricted access road guarded by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Another entrance at Manor Avenue is off limits. The home is located amongst several diplomatic residences and walking distance to Rideau Hall, the official residence of the Governor General of Canada. Lornado is surrounded by a wall of trees and located above Rockcliffe Park and next to a parkway alongside the Ottawa River. Lornado was the first diplomatic residence to be established in Rockcliffe Park, and it has since been joined by numerous diplomatic residences, including the Holy See. Over the years, many distinguished Americans and Canadians have been guests at Lornado. The list includes many U.S. Presidents and all Canadian Prime Ministers since 1935. American and Canadian visitors have included students, trade delegations, military officers, state governors, congressmen, diplomats, entrepreneurs, academics, bankers, artists, industrialists, educators, and U.S. and Canadian government officials. Lornado is the venue for the Ambassador's annual 4th of July celebration, when guests (embassy staff, their family and other invited persons) enjoy the spectacular grounds and sophisticated cuisine, mark the anniversary of 1776, hear the anthems of both countries, and witness the U.S. Marine Guards perform their flag drill, the Presentation of the Colors.Fourth of July in Ottawa, sans ambassador See also * 190 Coltrin Road ‚Äì Rockcliffe Park home of the Pakistani High Commissioner to Canada * Earnscliffe ‚Äì home to the British High Commission in Canada * Australia House (Ottawa) ‚Äì home to the Australian High Commissioner in Ottawa ReferencesExternal links * Lornado Lorando Category:Canada‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Diplomatic missions of the United States Category:Houses completed in 1908 Category:Limestone buildings ","title":"Lornado"},{"id":"26973094","text":"Albion Municipal Airport is a public use airport located three nautical miles (6 km) northwest of the central business district of Albion, in Boone County, Nebraska, United States.

Despite being a positional isomer of pipradrol, it is not a psychostimulant, and instead has mild depressant effects. The drug was introduced in Europe in the mid-1950s for the treatment of schizophrenia likely because it was found to attenuate the subjective psychedelic effects of LSD and mescaline in humans.

Family Lady Frances Anne Emily Vane was born on 15 April 1822 at the Duke of St Albans's house in St James's Square, London, the eldest daughter of Irish-born Charles Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry, and heiress Lady Frances Anne Vane-Tempest. At her baptism, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington stood as her godfather.Forster. She had three brothers, including George Vane-Tempest, 5th Marquess of Londonderry, and two younger sisters. She had an older half-brother, Frederick Stewart, 4th Marquess of Londonderry, by her father's first marriage to Lady Catherine Bligh. Marriage and issue On 12 July 1843 at St. George Street, Mayfair, Lady Frances married John Spencer- Churchill, Marquess of Blandford. Upon her marriage she was styled Marchioness of Blandford. The couple made their principal home at the Spencer-Churchill family seat of Blenheim Palace in Woodstock, Oxfordshire. The marriage produced eleven children: * George Charles Spencer-Churchill, 8th Duke of Marlborough (13 May 1844 ‚Äì 9 November 1892) * Lord Frederick John Winston Spencer-Churchill (2 February 1846 ‚Äì 5 August 1850) * Lady Cornelia Henrietta Maria Spencer-Churchill (17 September 1847 ‚Äì Upper Brook Street, Mayfair, London, 22 January 1927), married 25 May 1868 Ivor Bertie Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne, by whom she had issue. * Lady Rosamund Jane Frances Spencer- Churchill (died 3 December 1920), married 12 July 1877 William Fellowes, 2nd Baron de Ramsey, by whom she had issue * Lord Randolph Henry Spencer-Churchill (13 February 1849 ‚Äì 24 January 1895), married 15 April 1874 Jennie Jerome, father of Sir Winston Churchill and John Strange Spencer-Churchill. * Lady Fanny Octavia Louise Spencer-Churchill (29 January 1853 ‚Äì 5 August 1904), married 9 June 1873 Edward Marjoribanks, 2nd Baron Tweedmouth, by whom she had issue. * Lady Anne Emily Spencer-Churchill (Lower Brook Street, Mayfair, London, 14 November 1854 ‚Äì South Audley Street, Mayfair, London, 20 June 1923), married 11 June 1874 James Innes-Ker, 7th Duke of Roxburghe, by whom she had issue. * Lord Charles Ashley Spencer-Churchill (1856 ‚Äì 11 March 1858) * Lord Augustus Robert Spencer-Churchill (4 July 1858 ‚Äì 12 May 1859) * Lady Georgiana Elizabeth Spencer-Churchill (10 St James's Square, St James's, London, 14 May 1860 ‚Äì 9 February 1906), married 4 June 1883 Richard George Penn Curzon, 4th Earl Howe, by whom she had issue. * Lady Sarah Isabella Augusta Spencer-Churchill (1865 ‚Äì 22 October 1929), a war correspondent during the Boer War; married 21 November 1891 Lt. Col. Gordon Chesney Wilson (son of Sir Samuel Wilson, MP) An 1880 engraving of Blenheim Palace Duchess of Marlborough On 1 July 1857, her husband succeeded to the title of 7th Duke of Marlborough, and from that date henceforth, Frances was styled Duchess of Marlborough. She was a commanding and hot-tempered woman described in The Complete Peerage as a \\"woman of remarkable character and capacity, judicious and tactful\\". Her face had more strength than beauty and her eyes were either warm or hard, never lacklustre.Martin, p. 61. She ruled Blenheim Palace and its household with an iron hand; yet it was she who rejuvenated the palace with her lavish and gay entertainments which she herself organised; transforming the palace \\"into a social and political focus for the life of the nation\\". She was a domineering yet devoted mother; both of her surviving sons' marriages were a disappointment to her. Her eldest son George married a woman described as stupid, pious and dull, while her youngest and favourite son, Lord Randolph earned her displeasure by marrying, against the wishes of both herself and the Duke, American socialite Jennie Jerome, whom Frances openly disliked.Martin, pp. 61, 65, 73‚Äì74. Frances and her husband refused to attend Lord Randolph and Jennie's wedding at the British Embassy in Paris, which took place on Frances's 52nd birthday. Like the rest of the 19th-century British aristocracy, the Marlboroughs regarded American women as \\"strange and abnormal creatures with habits and manners something between a Red Indian and a Gaiety Girl\\". When the newly-wed couple moved to their home in Curzon Street in London, however, Frances arrived to help Jennie pay her first visits to the leaders of London society. She lent her some of her own jewels for the occasion, and the two women travelled in the Marlborough family coach.Martin, p. 101. Frances featured largely in the lives of the younger members of the family, including her grandson Winston, to whom she often acted as a substitute mother. From 1876 to 1880 her husband served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. As the result of her diligent efforts at famine relief in which she displayed humanity, proficiency and leadership that attempted to avert the effects of the 1879 Great Famine, she was invested as a Lady of the Order of Victoria and Albert by Queen Victoria. Lord Randolph Churchill, the youngest surviving son of Frances and the Duke Last years She became a widow in 1883, lost her eldest son, George, in 1892, and on 24 January 1895, her only surviving son, Lord Randolph Churchill, died at her London home in Grosvenor Square. She never stopped mourning Randolph, and harboured much resentment against his wife, whom she had never liked and now criticised for behaviour unbecoming a grieving widow. Death Frances died at Blenheim on 16 April 1899, the day after her 77th birthday, having outlived five of her eleven children. She was buried on 21 April 1899 in the family vault beneath Blenheim Chapel. Her grandson Sir Winston Churchill wrote of her: \\"She was a woman of exceptional capacity, energy and decision\\". Portrayals in film and television The Duchess was portrayed by Rachel Kempson in the 1974 Thames TV mini-series Jennie: Lady Randolph Churchill. AncestryReferencesSources *Martin, Ralph G.

He may have written \\"Shine On Harvest Moon\\", a claim supported by vaudeville performer and writer Eddie Cantor. He was also a charter member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers or ASCAP. Biography Stamper was born in New York City on November 10, 1883, and took up piano at age ten. At seventeen, he left school and became a pianist at a Coney Island dance hall for two years before becoming a \\"song- plugger\\" for publisher F. A. Mills. Stamper was twenty when he met singer Nora Bayes and her husband Jack Norworth becoming her accompanist and touring widely for the next four years. After Stamper left Bayes' employment, he resumed working as a song-plugger and vaudeville pianist. In 1910 he met Gene Buck, an artist who painted cover images for sheet music. The two started collaborating, with Buck providing lyrics for Stamper's melodies. Their first published songs were In the Cool of the Evening, Daddy Has a Sweetheart (and Mother Is Her Name) and Some Boy. Stamper's first marriage to Gertrude Springer ended in divorce after the birth of two children, Maurice and Regina Stamper. On 16 July 1926 he married \\"vaudeville and revue comedienne\\" Edna Leedom who had performed in the Follies of 1923, 1924 and 1925. The marriage ended within two years. On 16 August. 1928 he married Agnes White, a Follies performer who was in Stamper and Buck's musical Take The Air (1927). The couple were married for 40 years and produced one daughter, Susan Stamper, a dancer. One of their grandchildren is singer/songwriter Happy Rhodes. Stamper did not learn to read or write traditional musical notation, creating his own numerical notation. Career=The Ziegfeld years Sheet music for Tulip Time In 1912 Stamper began writing songs for the Ziegfeld Follies of 1913, contributing Just You and I and The Moon, Without You and Everybody Sometime Must Love Somebody. He is credited as \\"additional music\\" for the Follies of 1914 and 1915, but he wrote the majority of the music for the Follies of 1916. and was on an equal billing with Louis A. Hirsch, Jerome Kern, and Irving Berlin. The music of the Follies of 1917 was written by Stamper and Raymond Hubbell and he was described as \\"an old hand\\" for his work with Louis A. Hirsch by the Follies of 1918. In addition to his 1918 Follies work, he wrote all the music for Ziegfeld Midnight Frolic with Gene Buck, a series that also had editions in 1919, 1920 and 1921. The Follies of 1919 found Stamper branching out into writing lyrics as well as writing comic sketches. 1919 was a very busy year, with Stamper writing songs for the Follies as well as the Midnight Frolic and the Ziegfeld Nine O'Clock Review both of which appeared in a theater on the roof of the New Amsterdam theater. Stamper continued as principal songwriter for the Follies of 1920 through 1925, with an additional summer edition in 1923. He returned for the Follies of 1931, the last edition produced by Florenz Ziegfeld himself. Other musicals While his work with Ziegfeld encompassed the majority of his working life, Stamper and Gene Buck worked for other producers as well. He had songs in two plays - When Claudia Smiles (1914) and Broadway and Buttermilk (1916) prior to traveling to London with Buck to write songs for Zig Zag! which ran for 648 performances at the London Hippodrome. Stamper returned to London in 1918 to write songs for another review Box O' Tricks with Frederick Chapelle, which ran for 625 performances. During his first trip to London, Buck befriended a man who turned out to be a German spy. Two results of this event were fellow passenger Eddie Rickenbacker deciding to enlist to fly, and Dave Stamper having to prove to British police and a Judge that his pages covered with numbers were sheet music rather than a code. Stamper was fully occupied with work for Ziegfeld until 1927, when Gene Buck hired Stamper to write the music for Take The Air (1927). He also worked for the Schubert organization on Lovely Lady (1927) before returning to Ziegfeld for the 1931 Follies. He finished out his work on Broadway with Provincetown Follies (1935) which only ran for 63 performances and Orchids Preferred (1937) which closed in a week. Hollywood In 1928, Stamper was signed by Fox Film Corporation as a staff composer, remaining there until 1930. He contributed Dance Away the Night and Peasant Love Song to the film Married in Hollywood (1929) often called the first filmed operetta. The film Words and Music (1929) featured The Hunting Song, Take a Little Tip and Too Wonderful for Words all written with lyricist Harlan Thompson. In 1930, he contributed Only One and The Gay Heart written with Clare Kummer and Once In A While written with Clare Kummer and Cecil Arnold to the \\"singing cowboy\\" movie One Mad Kiss. and the Bela Lugosi film Such Men Are Dangerous. Shine On, Harvest Moon Stamper claimed to have written \\"Shine On, Harvest Moon\\", while the writers of record were his former employers Nora Bayes and Jack Norworth. Stamper's claim was supported by vaudeville comic Eddie Cantor in his 1934 book Ziegfeld, The Great Glorifier and David Ewen's All the Years of American Popular Music. Stamper was working as a pianist rather than as a songwriter at the time the song appeared but never learned how to read or write using traditional music notation thus he would have not been able submit the song for copyright, or produce sheet music to prove his claim. Bayes and Norworth compelled Stamper at one point to wear stage make-up to appear Japanese, apparently to keep him from being interviewed by reporters. In popular culture Stamper's caricature was on the wall at Sardi's restaurant. Stamper and Buck's song The Shakespearian Rag appears in T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land: Ring Lardner and George S. Kaufman mentioned Stamper in their play June Moon: John Hyams played Stamper in the 1936 film The Great Ziegfeld starring William Powell, which won the Academy Award for Best Motion Picture. His songwriting partner Gene Buck was played by William Demarest, best known as \\"Uncle Charley\\" on the TV show My Three Sons.

It is one of the earliest gaits learned by human infants, and has similar features to four-limbed movement in other primates and in non-primate quadrupeds. When crawls are used Children crawling on the ground during a fire drill in Italy. Crawling is used mainly: *When a person cannot yet walk because of being an infant *When a person cannot walk due to disability, being wounded, sick, or drunk *In very low places (caves, under a table, in a mine, etc.). Sometimes underground miners need to crawl long distances during their work *When searching for something on the ground *To get down to the ground in gardening, for maintenance or other work-related purposes which require a good reach on the ground *For stealth (camouflage and quietness) *To lower the field of vision *As an exercise *As a token of submission *For fun or comical purposes *During a fire, crawling may be used because the air near the ground is easier to breathe In infants A 10-month-old baby crawling by kneelingInfants sometimes \\"crawl\\" with their stomachs on the ground as early as 3 months, but this crawling is infrequent with the baby remaining stationary most of the time. True crawling with the stomach off the ground and the baby frequently on the move usually develops between 7 and 11 months of age and lasts anywhere from a week to 4 months before the child switches to walking. Even after taking their first unaided steps, most babies still crawl part of the time until they have mastered walking. While crawling, infants gradually practice standing, at first by using people or objects for support and, later, without support. Crawling babies are notorious for getting into trouble, so parents are often advised to childproof their house before a baby reaches crawling age. Though crawling is an important developmental milestone in children, it is not necessary for healthy development. Some babies skip crawling and go directly to walking. Others \\"bottom shuffle\\" instead of crawling (sometimes referred to as \\"bum- shuffling\\", or \\"scooting\\"). Bottom-shuffling babies sit on their bottoms and push themselves forward using their legs, and sometimes their hands, often in specially reinforced trousers. Babies that bottom-shuffle tend to walk later than babies that crawl. Whether infants crawl is also culturally determined. European parents in previous centuries discouraged it as being too animal- like. They kept their children in long dresses and other clothes that made crawling difficult or impossible. Some cultures consider it to be dirty and dangerous. Types of crawls=Standard crawl Crawling is a specific four-beat gait involving the hands and knees. A typical crawl is left-hand, right-knee, right-hand, left-knee, or a hand, the diagonal knee, the other hand then its diagonal knee. This is the first gait most humans learn, and is mainly used during early childhood, or when looking for something on the floor or under low relief. It can be used to move with a lower silhouette, but there are better crawls for that purpose. This is the most natural of the crawls and is the one that requires the least effort. Bear crawl US Airman performs a bear crawl The bear crawl is almost identical to the standard crawl, but the feet are used instead of the knees, which creates an arched or squatted body posture. This works as a faster crawl but requires more effort to maintain. Bridge walk This involves holding a gymnastic bridge and making small steps with the arms and legs. It is similar to a crab walk in that the body locomotes in a supine posture, but the arms are in shoulder flexion alongside the head. Because of its unusual appearance, bridgewalking has been used in several horror films to suggest the demonic possession of a character. These have included The Exorcist and The Unborn. Wrestler Bray Wyatt does this. Crab crawl The crab crawl is used in crab soccer. It starts by sitting down with the feet and hands flat on the ground, the hips are then raised off the ground and the chest faces the sky. It is similar to a bridge walk in that both have quadrupedal locomotion with a supine torso, but here the arms are held behind the torso, with the shoulder joint being in hyperextension. Due to its inefficiency, it is more commonly used as a form of exercise than actual transportation. Crabwalking builds triceps endurance\\"Crab Walk Exercise\\" at CombatFitness.co.uk and arm and leg strength, and is a recommended exercise of various school athletic departments and soccer organizations, such as USA football. USA The crab crawl is also useful for descending steep slopes with poor traction. Its feet-first orientation ensures a low center of mass to prevent tumbling, while the inverted posture allows one to see where they're going. Leopard crawl/high crawl Soldier crawls through mud during training The leopard crawl is a military-specific crawl. There are two versions, the leopard crawl proper and a modified version for when carrying weapons in the hands. This is a two-beat gait like a trot: an arm/elbow is advanced with the diagonal knee. This is designed for the smallest silhouette possible, and the body is often nearly or actually touching the ground, and although the elbow and knee are the main focus, most of the respective limbs touch the ground. Tiger crawl The tiger crawl is essentially a highly accelerated combination between crawl and leopard crawl. It uses the hands and the knees/feet depending upon the situation, while maintaining a silhouette almost as small as that of the leopard crawl. This is relatively fast gait but can take large amounts of energy.

The influence of the game was taken from F-Zero and the Wipeout video game series, resulting in a very similar game and negative reviews. The game was briefly shown in the 2008 film Meet Dave. The game features 30 tracks, and 15 crafts; however, when the first six races are available, the player must complete the game to unlock more tutorials and tracks. It also features \\"TrakEdit\\", a mode allowing players to create their own tracks using various objects. Tutorials guide the player to this mode. A two-player split screen mode is included in the game, as well as the Time Trial and Cup racing modes for one player. The player should choose a craft they like to use in the game, and then go through five series (each including six tracks). After the race has loaded, the screen will show a view of the track. The player will see a countdown that would begin the race. The player must finish at first, second or third place to win. If he or she successfully completed a series, the player unlocks more material.

Gameplay Screenshot showing Eagle Bronze Doors, an in-game area in PlaneShift PlaneShift gameplay is based on classical Multiplayer Role Playing Game style, with exploration, magic, single player or team based combat and quests. A major goal of the game is to explore and learn. This can either be done by reading books or by learning about the world by speaking with the NPCs. The interaction with the NPCs is based on predefined answers the player can pick from a list, and also a freeform text entry, which uses natural language parsing to interpret the text. Some of these NPC's provide quests and guidance on how to proceed to gain items and powers. The quests are sequenced to allow character progression in the different skills of the game. There are also events, hosted by Game Masters, that allow for unique quests, festivals and happenings. Players increase their character's skills by completing these quests in the game. The game has strong focus on Role-play (RP). IC (In- Character) behaviour and speech are promoted by the Game Master team. Players trade using the currency Tria, a triangle-shaped coin. There are denominations for 10, 50 and 250 Tria, named Hexas, Octas and Circles. Character creation The PlaneShift character creation tool features two options. The first option is to choose to make a \\"quick\\" character, in which a player chooses a \\"path\\" and the character's specific attributes are chosen based on the profession. A path reflects the career of the character in his youth, and has associated events which will set the starting skills and stats. The available paths are \\"Street Warrior\\", \\"Enchanter\\", \\"Fighting Monk\\", \\"Warlock\\", \\"Knight\\", \\"Rogue\\". The second option is to make a character with the \\"custom\\" method. This method allows the player to choose many additional aspects of the character by describing the story of his or her birth, parents, jobs, house, siblings, and the life events that happened up to his or her adulthood. The choices made affect the starting attributes and skills the character has.planeshift on Linux Magazine Combat PlaneShift features both player versus environment and player versus player combat. The latter is implemented as the ability to engage in duels on a voluntary basis, which requires both parties to agree to the conditions of the duel. If two players' guilds are at war with each other, they do not need to agree to a duel in order to initiate combat with each other. Characters attain progression points (PP) when they successfully engage in combat and use certain abilities, which are used for training attributes. PlaneShift uses a skill based progression system, which allows the player to develop this character in any skills without the mandatory choice of a profession. Magic PlaneShift magic comprises several distinct \\"Ways\\" (Schools): Crystal Way, Red Way, Brown Way, Azure Way, Blue Way, and Dark Way.

He worked for J & W Bateman which was a general supply company created by his father John Bateman (1824‚Äì1909) and his uncle, Walter Bateman, six years before this Bateman was born.Title: Death of Mr. W. A. Bateman Author: West Australian Staff Writer Publisher: The West Australian (Perth, WA: 1879 - 1954) Date: Monday, 29 July 1935, p.15 (Article) Web: http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32862964 Bateman was descended from John Bateman (1789‚Äì1855) who had been here in 1830 only a year after the colony was founded. Bateman took a leading role in establishing Australian rules football in Western Australia. A key meeting was held at Flindells Hotel in Fremantle in 1883 when a new football club was formed with Bateman as captain to play the Australian game. On 30 March 1883 the Swans Football Club was formed which had to organise games where possible as there was no league at that time. Although educated at Prince Alfred College in Adelaide, Bateman played his two first-class matches for Western Australia, debuting against his former state at the Adelaide Oval in March 1893. He dismissed opener Alfred Wilkinson for 12 and bowled future Test player Clem Hill for a duck with the ball and was then his team's second top run scorer in their first innings with 20 before Ernie Jones trapped him leg before wicket. Western Australia followed on and Bateman was dismissed for just one in the second innings. A few days later he appeared again in a match against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He struggled to have an impact as he failed to take a wicket and scored a duck in his only innings. Bateman didn't get an opportunity in the second innings as he was absent hurt. Bateman became an influential Australian rules football identity in Western Australia. He spent 10 seasons in the WAFA, playing in an unprecedented eight premierships. As their inaugural captain, Bateman started out at the original Fremantle Football Club in 1885. Two years later they disbanded and he moved to the Unions Football Club, who found themselves taken over by Fremantle in 1890. Bateman married and had five children. He died on Saturday 27 July 1935 at his home in Bulls Creek in Perth. He was inducted as one of the initial members of the West Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2004. Bateman's grandson Alan Bateman was a TV executive who started the TV soap Home and Away.

It ridicules secular and religious credulity, and lampoons the exaggerated religious \\"enthusiasm\\" (excessive emotion, not keenness) of the Methodist movement. The print was originally engraved in 1761, with the title Enthusiasm Delineated, but never published. The original print may have been a response to three essays published by Joshua Reynolds in The Idler in 1759, praising the sublime work of Italian Counter-Reformation artists. Hogarth reworked the engraving before publishing it on 15 March 1762 as Credulity, Superstition and Fanaticism: A Medley. It echoes his earlier print, The Sleeping Congregation of 1736, in which an Anglican clergyman's boring sermon puts his congregation to sleep. Interpretation=The preacher The print depicts a preacher ‚Äì possibly George WhitefieldImperial island: a history of Britain and its empire, 1660‚Äì1837, Paul Kl√©ber Monod, Wiley-Blackwell, 2009, , p.188 ‚Äì speaking to a church congregation from the top of a high pulpit. His text is opened at a page which reads \\"I speak as a fool\\", and he is wearing a Harlequin jacket under his clerical gown. He is holding a puppet of a devil with a gridiron in his left hand and a puppet of a witch suckling an incubus in his right hand. His wig is falling off to reveal a Jesuit's tonsure underneath. To the right, the \\"scale of vociferation\\" measures his oratory, rising from \\"natural tone\\" to \\"bull roar\\". (In Enthusiasm Delineated, the puppet of the witch was an abstract figure representing God, and the sides of the pulpit are adorned with additional pairs of religious puppets which are omitted in its final version.) Superstition The print includes visual references to more than a dozen reputed instances of witchcraft or possession in England.Anecdote biography, John Timbs, R. Bentley, 1860, p.66Witchcraft in Europe, 1100‚Äì1700: a documentary history, Alan Charles Kors, Edward Peters; University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001, , p.388 The three figures decorating the pulpit each hold a candle, and allude to the ghost seen by Sir George Villiers (whose name appears in a book held by the figure on the right), the ghost of the stabbed Julius Caesar appearing before Brutus, and the ghost of Mrs Veale (immortalised by Daniel Defoe in A True Relation of the Apparition of One Mrs. Veal the Next Day after her Death to One Mrs. Bargrave at Canterbury 8 September 1705). In a box pew at the foot of the pulpit, another clergyman pushes an icon of the Cock Lane ghost down the shirt of a young lady in the throes of religious ecstasy. (In Enthusiasm Delineated, this was an aristocratic rake fondling the breast of a woman.) The \\"Poors Box\\" has grown cobwebs, showing Hogarth's view that the Methodists were disregarding good works by emphasising faith so strongly. To the right, standing on copies of Wesley's Sermons, and Glanvill's Book of Witches, a religious thermometer measures the emotional states of a brain (or possibly a heart) from a central reading of lukewarm, either upwards through love heat, to lust, ecstasy, madness and raving, or downwards through low spirits to sorrow, agony, settled grief to despair, then madness and suicide. On top of the thermometer is an image of the Cock Lane ghost, and the Drummer of Tedworth. The congregation are in various states of ecstasy, grief and horror. Another minister sings, accompanied by weeping cherubs. A shoe-black vomits nails and pins ‚Äì possible a reference to the boy of Bilson, who ate metal items. Next to him a woman lies on the floor with rabbits running from under her skirt - this must be Mary Toft, a woman from Godalming, who in 1726 was supposed to have given birth to a litter of rabbits. A Jew with a knife sacrifices an insect on the altar. A turbaned Turk looks in at the window, quietly smoking a pipe, and thanks the prophet that he is a Muslim.

One man below the globe is terrified when a preacher next to him, possibly John Wesley, points it out to him. Beneath the engraving Hogarth quotes , \\"Believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they are of God: because many false Prophets are gone out into the World.\\" Reception Art historian Horace Walpole praised Hogarth, stating that this print \\"surpassed all his other performances\\" and \\"would alone immortalize his unequalled talents.\\"Memoirs of the reign of King George the Third, Volume 1, Horace Walpole, Lea & Blanchard, 1845 References Category:Prints by William Hogarth Category:1762 works ","title":"Credulity, Superstition, and Fanaticism"},{"id":"26973772","text":"Sardar Gian Singh Rarewala (16 December 1901-31 December 1979) was an Indian politician and the first Chief Minister (actually designated as the Prime Minister) of the former Indian state of Patiala and East Punjab States Union.

It is based in the state capital of Montgomery. The AEA is the largest education association in Alabama and is an advocate organization that leads the movement for excellence in education and is the voice of education professionals in Alabama. AEA's mission is to promote education excellence. The AEA provides legal assistance, professional development opportunities, member benefits, and a strong voice for education in the Alabama Legislature. The AEA serves as the advocate for its members and leads in the advancement of equitable and quality public education for Alabama's diverse population. The AEA is an affiliate of the National Education Association (NEA), the nation's largest professional employee organization. The AEA's stated mission is \\"to promote educational excellence, the Alabama Education Association shall serve as the advocate for its members and shall lead in the advancement of equitable and quality public education for a diverse population.\\" History One of the mandates of Reconstruction placed on the former Confederate states was that each had to write a new constitution acceptable to Congress before rejoining the Union. Alabama drafted a new state constitution in 1868. In the section on education, the following line was added: \\"And proper provision shall be made for the education of the children of white and colored persons in separate schools.\\" This helped create a system of education that would come to be known as separate but equal. As a result of this divide, two professional associations arose to represent teachers in the divided schools system. The association to represent teachers in White schools was known as the Alabama Education Association while the one representing teachers in Non-White schools was known as the Alabama State Teachers Association. In 1969, the Alabama Education Association and the Alabama State Teachers Association merged, with Paul R. Hubbert as executive secretary and Joe L. Reed as associate executive secretary. Modern Era Though it is officially a professional organization, it performs many of the same functions as a trade union, and is thus frequently referred to as such by the news media and other writers, as well as political opponents. (State law prevents public employees from being represented by a union per se, hence the designation.) http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-2528 \\"Thus, AEA is probably one of the leading state education associations in the nation in terms of representing teachers without union representation, which is the case for many states outside the South.\\" As a professional association, AEA is not able to call for strikes or participate in collective bargaining.

Nearest Railway Station: Rajapalayam (8 km) Nearby Airports: Madurai (85 km) and Thiruvananthapuram (176 km) Landmarks From Rajapalayam : 7 km towards east From Srivilliputtur - 14 km towards south History Rani Mangammal (ruled 1689‚Äì1704) was the 11th ruler of the Madurai Nayaka dynasty. She was a renowned queen in developing infrastructure such as roads, walkways, passenger rest houses, irrigation and gardens for small and remote villages far from the capital city of Madurai. Rani Mangammal was an accomplished and popular ruler, and her memory is still cherished in the countryside of the district. Mangammal specializes in civil administration, commerce and industry, irrigation and communications. Many irrigation channels were repaired, new roads were laid, and avenue trees were planted. The highway from Kanyakumari was originally built during the reign of Rani Mangammal, which was called 'Mangammal Road'. He also built many public works, especially for pilgrims. The Mangammal road which now passes through the village of Chatrapatti is called \\"Vanniyampatti\\" road. The 14 km long road connects the village of Chatrapatti to Srivilliputhur in the north and Mudukudi / Cholapuram in the south. This is the shortest route from Srivilliputhur to reach Sankarankovil/ Karivalamavantanallur. On the road was a Soultry (traveler's resting place - in Tamil it is called Chatra). The village derives its name from the Tamil word \\"Sathram\\" (a traveler's resting place) and \\"Patti\\" (suffix for a village). Climate The village is a region of extreme heat and low humidity. The north east monsoon provides the bulk of rainfall during the months of October and November. Again the north east monsoon, which starts in June and lasting until mid August (Courtallam Season), provides showers and makes the region relatively cooler than in other months. Places The village has Seven streets. They are: * North street * Middle Street * South Street * High School Street * Gnaniyar Koil Street * New Street * Vayakattu Street There is a huge bazaar in Middle street which remains filled with thousands of people in the evening as this place is the biggest marketplace east of Rajapalayam and there are two water storage dams namely 'vagaikulam' and 'kanakulam'. Education The village people give a lot of importance to education. There are two government schools in the village and two matriculation school and elementary schools are there. * Vinayagar Elementary School (The school had celebrated its platinum jubilee) * Government Higher Secondary School (A centenary school - A number of educated people in and around Chattrapatti are alumni of this school) The government's schools higher secondary school two in numbers one for boys now the students strength is very low government did not take any action to increase the strength why our village people admit their children in other schools nobody knows and other one for girls recently. The medium of instruction is Tamil. People go to Rajapalayam for English Medium Schools. Women's education has gained importance in the past few years due to economic reasons as wages from male members in the families of the society are not enough.  Mulaikottu & Thai Poosam  Mulaikottu is the famous festival in Chatrapatti. This festival is celebrated every year, second week of August. This festival is celebrated to thank the Women deity Maari amman (Goddess of Rain) for rain and wealth. Women in the houses grow nine types of grams in a pot (Mulaippaari) in a completely dark room for a week before the festival. On the second day of the festival, they carry the pot in head and put it in a well at a distance away from the village. People use this festival as a family uniting festival. This festival is common in several other parts of Tamil Nadu. The festival will be celebrated from Tuesday midnight to Friday before noon. all three days the Goddess Mariamman will be in chariot (Sapparam) at night in all the streets. this is the largest festival of this surrounding.

Name Rakitna was attested in written sources in 1265 as Raquitina (and as Rachitten in 1415 and Raczkitnichk in 1420). The name is a clipped adjectival form, shortened from *Rakitna vas (i.e., ' village'). The adjective rakitna comes from the Slovene common noun rakita 'eared willow', and so the name literally means '(village of the) eared willow', thus referring to the local vegetation. History Rakitna was along the route of the Roman road from Cerknica to Emona and from ƒåu≈°perk to Lu≈æarji. A barrier known as the \\"pagan wall\\" () was built to protect the road, closing off the valley between Mount Novaki (, 998 m) and Av≈°nik Hill (930 m). A school was established in Rakitna in 1903.

The tree was studied by the forestry researcher Miran Brinar (1909‚Äì2002), after whom it was named. The tree started growing 1890 and was characterized by an unusual columnar crown and markedly shorter, wider, and denser needles with a denser distribution of stomata. It also had a significantly faster rate of growth than surrounding firs and produced cones annually rather than every two to three years. The tree was felled by an unknown vandal in July 2016.

It can be reprogrammed using something called the Cant, and this is what some deities from ancient myths, called the Unkin, have done. One group of Unkin see themselves as Angels, and have set up a Covenant promising to reject any ancient deity looking to regain his or her past glory; they are at the time of the narration getting ready for a final war. A group of newly born Unkin (one can become an Unkin through certain unspecified events in his or her life) who refuse to take part in such war are the main characters: Seamus Finnan, an Irish angel hiding out in the desert; Phreedom Messenger, a trailer park biker trying to avoid conscription; Thomas Messenger, her gay brother who is trying to disappear into the Vellum where he will never be found; Jack Carter, a Covenant spear-carrier sent to kill Thomas but in love with him. Next to them are Joey Pechorin and Don MacChuill (who will gain more importance in Ink, the sequel to Vellum). The main characters' story is framed within the story of the Book of All Hours, a tome in which Metatron, the scribe of the Covenant, has inscribed the destiny of the whole Vellum; the book has been stolen by Guy Reynard, who uses it to travel through the Vellum. This frame story appears in short sections called Errata, at the end of each chapter. The events in the novel are described in a non-linear order, with several skips ahead and back in time. The story of the characters is linked to the Sumerian myth of Inanna and her descent to the underworld and to Aeschylus's tragedy Prometheus Bound. It is divided in two parts dedicated to the seasons of Summer, entitled \\"The Lost Deus of Sumer\\", and Fall, called \\"Evenfall Leaves\\". Besides the myths and legends referred to, there are also several very vivid references to history, with some of the characters living through such events as the Battle of the Somme or the Glasgow 1919 Battle of George Square. The seven main characters are archetypes of characters from myths and legends: Jack, also known as Jack Flash, Spring Heeled Jack, Iacchus and Captain Jack Carter (a legendary World War I hero in one of the parallel worlds in which the novel is set), also inspired by Luther Arkwright and Michael Moorcock's Oswald Bastable and Jerry Cornelius; Thomas Messenger, also known as Puck, Tamuz and Matthew Shepard; Phreedom Messenger, known as Anna, Anaesthesia and Inanna; Guy Fox, who is also Guy Fawkes (although closer to his representation in V for Vendetta than to the historic character), Guy Reynard and (the Prussian Baron Reinhardt); Joey Pechorin (also Joey Narchosis and Judas) Don MacChuill (also Don Coyote, Don Quixote) and Seamus Finnan (Shammus, Finnegan, Prometheus, Samuel Hobbsbaum, Sammael). From a psychoanalytic point of view, the seven main characters can also be seen as the Super-ego as guiding conscience (Guy/Reynard), the wild and libidinous Id (Jack), the Anima and Animus as a triple goddess/god figure (Phreedom), the ‚Äúinner child‚Äù of the Self (Thomas), the Ego that has to deal with society and reality (Seamus), the Shadow as the dark side (Joey), and the wise hermit or old soldier as an image of age and experience (Don). The author himself defined his novel \\"a Cubist epic fantasy\\". The homosexual theme is also strongly referred to, especially in the character of Thomas/Puck and his relationship with Jack. Puck is explicitly identified with Matthew Shephard. Reception The reception to Vellum varied. Some critics found it confusing, although most admitted its stylistic value,Vector, #243, September‚ÄìOctober 2005: \\"Vellum by Hal Duncan\\" while others appreciated its experimental nature. It has been criticised as too much focused on \\"being cool\\", even though the depth of Duncan's research cannot be denied. Awards Vellum was nominated for the 2006 World Fantasy Award, won by Haruki Murakami with Kafka on the Shore, and the 2006 Locus Award in the \\"Best First Novel\\" category, won by Elizabeth Bear with her trilogy formed by Hammered, Scardown and Worldwired. It won the 2007 Spectrum Award for the best novel published in the United States by a LGBT writer and the 2010 T√§htivaeltaja Award for the best science fiction novel published in Finnish.

Statement  Let (V, ¬∑) be an n-dimensional normed vector space. Then there exists a basis {e1, ..., en} of V such that : ei = 1 and ei = 1 for i = 1, ..., n, where {e1, ..., en} is a basis of V* dual to {e1, ..., en}, i. e. ei(ej) = Œ¥ij. A basis with this property is called an Auerbach basis. If V is an inner product space (or even infinite-dimensional Hilbert space) then this result is obvious as one may take for {ei} any orthonormal basis of V (the dual basis is then {(ei¬∑)}).  Geometric formulation  An equivalent statement is the following: any centrally symmetric convex body in \\\\mathbf{R}^n has a linear image which contains the unit cross-polytope (the unit ball for the \\\\ell_1^n norm) and is contained in the unit cube (the unit ball for the \\\\ell_{\\\\infty}^n norm).  Corollary  The lemma has a corollary with implications to approximation theory. Let V be an n-dimensional subspace of a normed vector space (X, ¬∑). Then there exists a projection P of X onto V such that P ‚â§ n.  Proof  Let {e1, ..., en} be an Auerbach basis of V and {e1, ..., en} corresponding dual basis. By Hahn‚ÄìBanach theorem each ei extends to f i ‚àà X* such that : f i = 1. Now set : P(x) = ‚àë f i(x) ei. It's easy to check that P is indeed a projection onto V and that P ‚â§ n (this follows from triangle inequality).

The battleship Tirpitz had served as one of the main threats against supply convoys sailing to Murmansk. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, a German naval base was established in Altafjord to prevent convoys from the Western Allies from delivering supplies to the Soviet Union. These supplies were deemed critical to the outcome of the war on the Eastern Front. The Alta area was one of Germany's largest naval bases during the war. Tirpitz, which was one of the world's largest and most powerful battleships, was anchored for nearly two years in K√•fjord. Altafjord was also a base for many other German warships among them the battleship and the heavy cruiser as well as dozens of German destroyers and supply ships. On 12 November 1944, Tirpitz was hit by bombs and the ship capsized in the bay outside of Troms√∏. The timber building that the Tirpitz Museum is located in dates from approximately 1880. It was originally built in Lillehammer. It was taken down and sent to Alta in 1946 as part of the effort to help rebuild the war-ravaged region. Initially the building served as the first nursing home in Finnmark. It remained in use until the new nursing home in K√•fjord was built in 1961.

Football career Cheetham was born in Byker, Newcastle upon Tyne. Access individual season statistics via Season Stats dropdown menu. A late entrant to the professional game, he played local football before joining the Army and played for his regiment while serving in the Royal Artillery. In August 1935, aged nearly 25, he signed for London club Queens Park Rangers, then playing in the Football League Third Division South. He made his debut on 4 September 1935 in a 1‚Äì1 draw away to Brighton & Hove Albion. Although he did not score in that first game, his next two games brought six goals, a six-game spell running up to Christmas produced 11 and from the 35 games he played in his first League season as a professional footballer, Cheetham scored 36 times. He set a new club record by scoring in 9 consecutive games at QPR's home ground, Loftus Road. His performances earned him an invitation to play for the Possibles against the Probables in March 1936 in a trial match for selection for the England national team. The quality of the Probables' defence, with Alf Young outstanding, meant Cheetham had little chance to shine ‚Äì The Times' correspondent reported that \\"Cheetham did not receive a pass for nearly half an hour\\", but \\"considering the brilliance of Young, the play of Cheetham could hardly be considered unsatisfactory\\". Though his next two seasons were less productive,http://qprnet.com/misc/seasonalstats/excels/QPR1936.xlshttp://www.qprnet.com/misc/seasonalstats/excels/QPR1937.xls in 1938‚Äì39 he scored 22 league goals from the 26 games before he left the club on 7 February 1939 to join First Division club Brentford for a fee of ¬£5,000.http://www.qprnet.com/misc/seasonalstats/excels/QPR1938.xls Brentford brought in Cheetham and inside forward Les Boulter to help their fight against relegation, though The Times suggested that their weakness lay less in attack than in defence. Cheetham made his debut in the top division in a 4‚Äì2 home defeat to Aston Villa, but he went on to score twice as Brentford beat fellow relegation strugglers Chelsea 3‚Äì1 and created both goals in a 2‚Äì0 defeat of Leicester City in early April, by which time his club had achieved a mid-table position. He finished the 1938‚Äì39 season with eight goals. The outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 put a stop to the Football League for the duration and caused a major interruption to Cheetham's career. During the war, he joined Lincoln City. He played for them in wartime competitions, and also turned out for West Ham United. Then in the 1946‚Äì47 Football League season, the first full season after the war, Cheetham resumed his prolific goalscoring; 30 goals from 41 games in League and FA Cup made him Lincoln City's leading scorer. He played only infrequently in 1947‚Äì48. His last game came on 6 April 1948 against Rochdale and he retired from professional football at the age of 37.  Personal life  Cheetham was a member of the Territorial Army during the Second World War and was injured at Dunkirk. After his retirement as a player he worked for a Croydon-based building contractors firm in the mid-1950s and lived in North London. Cheetham died in 1993, aged 83.

Biography Karen Holtsmark, c. 1938 Holtsmark was born at √Ös in Akershus, Norway. She was a daughter of Gabriel Gabrielsen Holtsmark (1867‚Äì1954) and his wife Margrete Weisse (1871‚Äì1933). Her father was a physicist and her mother was an educator. She was a maternal granddaughter of philologist Johan Peter Weisse, and a paternal granddaughter of agriculturalist and politician Bent Holtsmark. She was a niece of politicians Bernt and Torger Holtsmark, and a sister of professors Johan and Anne Holtsmark. She married Haakon R. Br√¶kken in July 1936, but the marriage was dissolved. Career Holtsmark attended the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry from 1924 to 1927 and the Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts from 1927 to 1930. Her most important teacher was Axel Revold, and she was also influenced by Vilhelm Bjerke-Petersen to take up the Surrealist style. Some of her paintings were Expressionist. She also became a Communist, and stayed several times in France where she also studied under Georg Jacobsen in 1936. In 1932 Holtsmark participated in a group exhibition at the Kunstnerforbundet in Oslo with Bjarne Rise, Johannes Rian and Vilhelm Bjerke- Petersen. She had her first exhibit at Kunstnerforbundet in 1935, and had major exhibits in Copenhagen in 1935 and Lund, Sweden in 1937. In 1959 she was one of the winners of a contest to be displayed in the Parliament of Norway.

Football career Reed was born in Holbeach, Lincolnshire, and played local football in the Lincolnshire area before a successful trial led to his signing for Sheffield United. He made his debut in the 1931‚Äì32 season, and scored his first goal on 19 September 1931 as Sheffield United beat Birmingham 3‚Äì1 in the Football League First Division. After two seasons with Sheffield United, during which he played only twice in the League, Reed moved to Lincoln City, newly promoted to the Second Division. He played in only a third of Lincoln's games in his first season, and around a half in the next, nevertheless finishing as the club's leading scorer for 1933‚Äì34, though with only seven goals as the club were relegated to the Third Division North. Reed appeared regularly in 1934‚Äì35, and scored 17 goals from only 25 games ‚Äì only one goal behind Johnny Campbell's tally of 18, which had come from a full season's worth of matches ‚Äì before leaving the club to join Third Division rivals Southport in February 1935.

Reed joined Chesterfield for a fee of ¬£800, scored on debut in a 3‚Äì1 defeat of Tranmere Rovers, and helped the club to the championship of the Third Division North and consequent promotion. He played regularly in the Second Division until January 1937, when he played his last game for the club, the third-round FA Cup defeat to Arsenal, and returned to non-League football with Spalding United. He spent the 1937‚Äì38 season with Mansfield Town and the next season with Notts County before dropping back into Lincolnshire local football with Pinchbeck and then with Crowland.

It was named in 1819 from the Greek for bitter, in allusion to its magnesium content, and its chemical similarity to pharmacolite. The mineral irhtemite, Ca4Mg(AsO3OH)2(AsO4)2¬∑4H2O, has the same composition as picropharmacolite, except that it has only four water molecules per formula unit, instead of eleven. It may be formed by the dehydration of picropharmacolite.  Structure  Infrared spectraAmerican Mineralogist (1974) 59:807 show that picropharmacolite contains water molecules H2O, hydroxyl groups (OH)‚àí co- ordinated with Mg2+ cations, and acid arsenate radicals (HAsO4)2‚àí. There are strong structural similarities with guerinite, Ca5(AsO3OH)2(AsO4)2.9H2O which indicates a similar formula for the two minerals.American Mineralogist (1976) 61:326 X-ray diffraction methods indicate that As, Ca and Mg cations are positioned in corrugated layers parallel to the c axis, the layers being linked by hydrogen bonding only. Four independent water molecules are sandwiched between adjacent layers, and build up hydrogen-bonded chains which are also parallel to the c axis. The ratio of four Ca to one Mg remains fairly steady, and no significant Ca/Mg substitution occurs in any cation site. Hence if the formula of picropharmacolite is written as Ca4Mg(H2O)7(AsO3OH)2(AsO4)2.4H2O,American MIneralogist (1981) 66:385 it is a better representation of the structure than the more usual formula Ca4Mg(AsO3OH)2(AsO4)2.11H2O.  Morphology  Picropharmacolite is usually found as small to microscopic pearly white botryoidal aggregates with a radiating foliated structure internally. Less commonly it occurs as silky fibrous aggregates or minute needle-like crystals, that are rectangular prisms elongated along the c axis.  Environment  Formed as an oxidation product of arsenic-bearing sulfides in reaction with surrounding calcium-bearing rocks, and as a recent efflorescence in mine workings. Erythrite and pharmacolite are common associated minerals.  Type locality  It was first described for samples from ore dumps of the Richelsdorf Smelter, S√ºss, Richelsdorf District, Hesse, Germany. The type material is stored at the National School of Mines, Paris, France, 95.497.

Biography  Max von Brandt was the son of Prussian general and military author Heinrich von Brandt. He was baptized as Protestant and attended the French College in Berlin. At first he became a Prussian officer before taking part in the Eulenburg Expedition of 1860/61 to East Asia leading to the signage of a Japanese-Prussian trade- treaty on January, 24th. Afterwards, Max von Brandt was consul and later general consul of the North German Confederation, and from 1872, German \\"Ministerresident\\" in Japan. From 1875 to 1893 he then was imperial envoy in China and, in 1882/1883, concluded a trade- and amicability-treaty with Korea, where he intensely studied the culture and history of East Asia. Due to his detailed knowledge of Asia, his impressive personality as well as his pleasantness, von Brandt was highly esteemed in Beijing, where he became doyen of the diplomatic corps for many years.  Japan post  Max von Brandt spent most of his diplomatic career serving in East Asia, where he was first a part of the Prussian mission in 1860. Two years later, he became the consul of Yokohama. In his early years in the region, he was mostly dismissed due to his low rank as a consul. Brandt, therefore, acquired a tendency to assert himself in order to coordinate the German policy with the other representatives of treaty powers in East Asia. It was said that, in order to do this, he often outlined ambitious colonial projects to assert his own influence. There were several recorded documents that offer insights into Brandt's activities in Japan. For example, he started cultivating German assets, whom he sent to serve as military advisers to emerging Japanese groups after learning of the successes of a German sergeant called Carl Koppen. Koppen built a reputation for transforming a band of samurai into a modern army in Wakayama. Brandt solidified his position in Japan by successfully transitioning the focus of the German policy in the country. Initially, there was the ambition of creating a German colonial outpost in Japan. However, due to the consolidation of Japan under the Meiji emperor, Brandt promoted the expansion of German commercial and cultural presence in the country.

In this story, Hardy tells the story of two brothers who are so ambitious to get out of their social environment that they ignore moral values and willingly accept their father's death and hide all that from their sister. The story is divided in five chapters and follows the dramatic structure of classical drama. The story is set in Narrowbourne, which was Hardy's name for West Coker in Somerset. Summary The story deals with the two brothers Joshua and Cornelius Halborough and their determination to better their lot in life, Joshua the elder being the driving force as opposed to his more compliant brother. The short story is set in the later part of the 19th century. Reading the Epistle to the Hebrews in Greek the two boys Joshua and Cornelius are interrupted by their drunken father who used to be a respectable millwright but has become an alcoholic. They are dismayed by their father's behaviour and Joshua guides him to the straw-shed where he starts snoring. Previously their younger sister Rosa has tried to distract them from their studies but they have ignored her. Joshua Halborough Senior used all the 900 pounds left for his two sons by their mother, who had previously died, for drinking. This left the boys unable to go to Oxford University, as their mother had planned, so they study in a training college for schoolmasters, where they get scholarships. Joshua borrows sufficient money from a local farmer to place his sister Rosa in a finishing school for several years A few years later Joshua is studying at the theological college where he is supported by his bishop and is going to be presented for ordination. He visits his brother Cornelius, who is a schoolmaster but Joshua is dismissive of this as an occupation and wants Cornelius to become a clergyman too. Joshua muses that he might have aspired to become a bishop had he been able to go to Oxford but is unlikely to achieve this now. Cornelius is easily persuaded that he should also become a clergy man. He tells Joshua that his father has recently called on him asking for money. Both love their sister Rosa and want to help her have a good life. We are told that their somewhat harsh faces soften when they speak of her to each other. Joshua meets his father with his new wife when they turn up at his theological college. Joshua's father embarrasses him by approaching the sub dean when the worse for drink and Joshua doubts that his father really is married to the woman who accompanies him. Joshua is mortified by this incident and decides to raise enough money to send his father and supposed stepmother away to Canada. Joshua, who is ordained by now, greatly impresses the congregation at Narrowbourne when he officiates the first time and is asked to dine with the local landowning Fellmer family. During dinner Mrs. Fellmer is surprised by Rosa's sophistication when she dines with them. She muses that had she known how pretty Rosa was she might not have invited her. Albert, Mrs. Fellmer's son, the Squire and a widower, is attracted by Rosa and wants to marry her. Joshua had not anticipated such an outcome to his educating Rosa and is delighted. Everything seems to be going well for the Halborough family - Cornelius has been ordained and is now Vicar at Narrowbourne Joshua having taken a living elsewhere Then Cornelius comes to tell Joshua that his father has returned to England and is currently in a local gaol after being sentenced for breaking a window while drunk. Fortunately the local newspaper has misspelled his surname. Rosa is not yet formally engaged to the Squire and the brothers fear that their father's inopportune return will ruin everything just when Mrs Fellmer has been brought round to approving the marriage. They decide to go to the town where there father is imprisoned and meet him after he is released from gaol in an attempt to persuade him to go away again. The day before his release date the father has written to Cornelius stating his intention of coming to Narrowbourne to visit his daughter who he has heard will be making an advantageous marriage. He asks his sons to meet him in an inn six miles away. However, when the brothers arrive there their father has already left, reportedly in an intoxicated state. The brothers hasten back to Narrowbourne and overtake their father who is drunk and quarrelsome. He tricks Joshua into drinking some raw spirits from a flask and taunts Joshua about having been illegitimate, his mother not having been married until after his birth, much to Joshua's mortification. He insists he will attend his daughter's wedding. He walks on ahead and falls into the weir. Cornelius leaps forward to rescue him but Joshua restrains him and both stand by and allow their father to drown. They do not say anything to anyone about what has occurred and wait for months for the body to be discovered. In the meantime, Rosa marries the Squire. Six months later the body is found but it is unrecognisable. Cornelius can not bear to officiate at the burial service and sends for Joshua to do it instead. Their sister comes to visit and tells them that on the night of her engagement she heard someone calling her name and wonders whether it had anything to do with the unfortunate man who had drowned in the weir. After she leaves Cornelius expresses that he wants to confess everything to her but Joshua talks him out of this. The two brothers do not then see each other for a long while but meet again at the Christening of Rosa's son. Afterwards they are drawn back to the weir where their father drowned. Cornelius muses that he often thinks of suicide and Joshua replies that this thought has come to his mind also.  Characters  Joshua and Cornelius Halborough: Joshua and Cornelius are brothers and have a younger sister, Rosa. Their father, Joshua Halborough senior, is a millwright. He was once successful but his business has fallen off because of his increasing unreliability. In his younger days he had some charm, as he managed to persuade the mother of his children into a relationship with him prior to marriage, as a result of which Joshua was in fact born illegitimate. She was clearly a woman of character, stinting herself to save up enough to send her sons to University, sadly all to no avail because of her death before this could be fulfilled. The brothers bitterly resent the loss of opportunity resulting from their father frittering away this money which means they have to qualify the hard way, by first becoming pupil teachers and then being accepted into theological college. Joshua is the driving force behind the brothers' determination to better themselves; Cornelius is a weaker character who tend to do whatever Joshua tells him. Joshua is extremely focused on bettering his lot and that of his siblings; he puts himself under considerable privations to obtain an education for his sister. Although Joshua tries to persuade himself and Cornelius that they have a vocation to be clergyman both are using the Church as a vehicle for their own advancement. Although Joshua is an inspiring preacher it is notable that one never once sees him praying for guidance as to how to deal with the perennial problem of his father. In the end, when he allows his father to drown, he is not only motivated by a desire to save Rosa's prospects but also a long festering hatred and resentment of his father who has blighted his prospects and has just taunted the memory of his deceased mother jeering that she was unmarried when he was born. Cornelius, the weaker character, has the right instinct to save his father, but is too long used to obeying his elder brother to resist him and insist on intervening to save his father. It is Cornelius who is the most overcome by remorse although Joshua too appreciates that he has done a grave wrong. We are told that it was to Cornelius rather than Joshua that the millwright wrote when he had anything to communicate so it is possible he had more of a relationship with his father despite his father's shortcomings. What will become of these two after the end of the novel? Neither will achieve what they had hoped at the outset of the story. Cornelius may well end up committing suicide. Joshua probably will resist any urges of that nature but will end up lonely and embittered, unlikely to marry because of the shameful secret that is on his soul, and not on particularly good terms with his nephews and nieces who will be somewhat frightened of him. Rosa Halborough: ''' Rosa Halborough is the younger sister of Joshua and Cornelius. She is able to live a quite happy life because she is protected by her brothers. Her brothers talk about Rosa as an intelligent and beautiful young woman. Rosa attended a school in Brussels where she received a good education. Joshua makes considerable personal sacrifices to pay for her education, even getting himself into debt. The investment pays off as Rosa makes a very advantageous marriage. At the same time she is clearly a nice girl, not at all calculating, and will be a good stepmother to the widowed Squire's daughter. It is unclear what her relationship with her father was like, there is no suggestion that she feels the bitter antagonism her brother's feel. She would clearly be horrified if she knew of the manner of his death and the role of her brothers in it. What will Rosa's future be like? Clearly she is in a very happy position, having married the Squire, been accepted by his mother and produced a son and heir. However, lurking in the background is a sense that knowledge of the dark family secrets may come out - she has heard her father's drowning cries, although not realising it was him, and Cornelius feels impelled to tell her the truth. Cornelius probably won't tell her but if he does commit suicide it is to be hoped he can disguise it as an accident. Her relationship with Joshua is unlikely to be good in the future as he becomes more and more reclusive and intimidating - this will be a source of sorrow to her as she will strive to understand the reason for this and not be able to References Category:1894 short stories Category:Works by Thomas Hardy ","title":"A Tragedy of Two Ambitions"},{"id":"26974439","text":"The Sweet Life is a Philippine television lifestyle informative show broadcast by Q.

It was founded in Edinburgh in 1810, and obtained a royal charter in 1831. It grew substantially through the 19th and early 20th centuries, until 1958, when it merged with the National Bank of Scotland to become the National Commercial Bank of Scotland. Ten years later the National Commercial Bank merged with the Royal Bank of Scotland. History=Formation The Commercial Bank of Scotland was formed in 1810 in response to public dissatisfaction with the three charter banks (Bank of Scotland, British Linen Bank and The Royal Bank of Scotland: \\"it was felt by many of the Scottish people that the three old Banks had become too‚Ä¶devoted to their own interests‚Ä¶to be the real promoters of the general good.\\"James Anderson, The Story of the Commercial Bank of Scotland (1910) Checkland argued that the project was \\"without precedent\\" for the proposed joint stock company relied not on a restricted group of wealthy men but on \\"a very large group of investors, including those of more modest means, numbered in hundreds, distributed throughout Scotland\\".S. G. Checkland Scottish Banking a History 1695-1973 (1975) The original bank premises were created by David Sandeman at 22 Picardy Place at the head of Leith Walk in Edinburgh.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1811 The early years It was always the intention to create a national branch structure and Bank's note issue was used as a form of early advertising: \\"it was the policy of the directors to arrange for note \`circulators\` throughout the country as a preliminary to actual agencies, the object being to familiarize the general public with the new Bank\\".Our Bank The Story of the Commercial Bank of Scotland 1810-1941 (1941) The Commercial enjoyed immediate success and within twelve months it was \\"doing a fair proportion of the Banking business in Edinburgh and Leith\\", and had five branches outside the City. Within two years there were 11 branches and 30 by 1830. This success was despite the first manager having no banking experience and being \\"slow to learn\\" to the extent that he was removed in little more than a year. His successor, Alexander MacArtney, had been trained by private bankers and \\"was a man of real depth and ability\\". The Bank had been keen to obtain a Royal Charter from the outset but it did not succeed until 1831. The title figure chosen to be the nominal head of the Bank was James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale, the first of four Earls of Lauderdale to serve as Governor over a period of fifty years. In 1834, after several years of success, they built a hugely impressive new headquarters on George Street in Edinburgh, designed by David Rhind.Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh by Gifford, McWilliam and Walker Branch expansion Although \\"still anxious to extend branches\\" MacArtney proposed that the Bank investigate the possibility of acquiring distressed provincial banking businesses. In 1826, the Bank duly acquired the sole-partner Caithness Bank in Wick. With the exception of the two-office Arbroath Bank in 1844, that was the limit of the Bank's acquisitions. From then on the story of the Commercial Bank was of steady organic expansion, accelerating as the century progressed: from 56 in 1860, the number of branches rose to 127 in 1890 and 167 in 1910, the Bank's centenary. The bank's relative success towards the end of its century was emphasised by its rise from fifth place in 1895 in terms of deposits to second place in 1914. However, one area where the Bank lagged was that it was the last of the seven large banks to open a London office ‚Äì not done until 1883. Amalgamation The inter-war period saw continued branch expansion, the number rising from 240 in 1920 to 385 in 1940 when it owned the largest network in Scotland. However, the post-war period was one of radical change for Scottish banks with mergers and fresh links with English Banks. In 1953 an outsider, Ian Macdonald, had been appointed general manager of the Commercial. He presided over a bank \\"that had been particularly aggressive in branch formation‚Ä¶with somewhat modest capital\\". Macdonald set out a ten-year programme both to find an amalgamation partner and to diversify. The diversification came in the form of hire purchase and in 1954 the Commercial became the first British bank to enter the hire purchase business when it acquired the Scottish Midland Guarantee Trust. Finding a new partner took longer. Discussions with British Linen came to naught but then Lloyds Bank approached the Commercial offering to sell its 100% holding in the National Bank of Scotland in return for a minority stake in the enlarged entity; the merger took place in 1958 creating the National Commercial Bank of Scotland.

The school itself is located in Terrassa (province of Barcelona). It offers 8 degree programs and currently there are 1.500 students enrolled. EET is located in the Terrassa Campus of the UPC.  Degrees  Degrees offered at EET are adjusted to the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) and cover different knowledge areas: *Industrial Engineering: **Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering **Bachelor's degree in Industrial Electronic and Automatic Control Engineering **Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering **Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering **Bachelor's degree in Textile Technology and Design Engineering **Bachelor's degree in Industrial Design Product Development Engineering *Telecommunication Engineering: **Bachelor's degree in Audiovisual Systems Engineering *Masters: **Master's degree in Textile, Paper and Graphic Engineering History The activity in the School of Engineering of Terrassa started in August 1901 and the teaching in February 1902. At the beginning it was known as the Escuela Superior de Industrias de Tarrassa (High Industrial School of Terrassa) where the following areas were taught: Engineering, Practical Engineering and elementary education for workers. Originally the school was founded to cover the needs of the Textile Industry of Terrassa. This industry reached the peak of its development in the 19th Century with the arrival of the steam engine and the new mechanical looms. Initially it was located in Topete Street-4 and in July 1904 it was moved to its current address, Colom Street-1, where it took place the inauguration of this Catalan modernist building that gave a proud distinction to the city of Terrassa. This work of art was a construction of the architect Llu√≠s Muncunill Parellada. An exhibition celebrated during that year represented the most culminating moment of the applied arts. In 1943 the building became property of the Government and kept its teaching function. Detail of the main entrance The Textile Engineering teaching has been a characteristic of The School of Engineering of Terrassa, offered since 1906 and now adapted to the new degrees. Other fields of engineering were also taught in the school: Chemical, Mechanics, Electrical and Electronics. In 1962 the field of Engineering was separated from the field of Higher Education and the teaching activity started at the Escuela T√©cnica Superior de Ingenieros Industriales (Technical High School of Industrial Engineering), in Colom Street-1. In 1972 the school started to be part of the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Barcelona, which afterwards became into Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC).  A modernist building  The Industrial School is one of the first works of Llu√≠s Muncunill and it was characterized by the influence of a historicist style. It is an isolated 2-floor building with ground floor and U-shaped that surrounds a patio. The main hall, that gives direct access to the classrooms, the library and other rooms, is supported by steel columns and there is a bust of the founder of the school, Alfonso Salonsa. The main facade is notable for the stairs in the principal entrance and both lateral sections. According to the project of Josep Dom√®nech i Mansana, two perpendicular naves were added to the ends of the original building that had the initial use of workshops.  Location  EET is formed by TR1 (main building), TR2 (back building) and TR3 (lateral nave) of the Campus of Terrassa, and the main entrance of TR1 is located in Colom Street-1. The Campus of the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya is located in Terrassa downtown. It has good transport connection with Barcelona city and its metropolitan area (local trains of RENFE, FFCC, and the city bus network). The Campus academic activity consists of undergraduate (degrees), postgraduate (masters) and doctorate programmes. At present there are more than 5000 students enrolled and it is considered as one of the most important universities in Catalunya.

Argentina's first native born opera composer was Francisco Hargreaves (1849‚Äì1900) who composed La gatta bianca (1875) and Los estudiantes de Bologna (1897), followed by Zen√≥n Rol√≥n (1856‚Äì1902) who composed several operas as well as operettas and zarzuelas.Apel, Willi (ed.), \\"Argentina\\", Harvard Dictionary of Music] 2nd edition, Harvard University Press, 1969, p. 49. The works of many of the composers from this generation were first performed outside Argentina. Native Argentine opera was to develop much more with the massive European (mainly Italian) immigration in the late 19th century and even more with the opening of the Teatro Col√≥n in 1908 where most of the 20th century operas listed here had their world premieres. Some of the first operas to treat Argentine subjects or national themes were Arturo Berutti's Pampa (1897) based on the life of Juan Moreira and Yupanki (1899) based on the life of Inca warrior Manqu Inka Yupanki. Also notable in this genre were Felipe Boero's Tucum√°n (1918) set during the Battle of Tucum√°n and El matrero (1929). Considered by many to be the quintessential Argentine opera, El matrero had a libretto based on gaucho folk tradition and incorporated Argentine folk melodies and a traditional gaucho dance. The Spanish playwright Federico Garc√≠a Lorca was also the inspiration for several Argentine operas. His plays, La zapatera prodigiosa and Bodas de sangre, were the basis of operas by Juan Jos√© Castro, while Osvaldo Golijov's 2003 opera Ainadamar is based on events in the playwright's life.

Marquis Thomas Bailey Marquis (December 19, 1869 ‚Äì March 22, 1935) was an American self-taught historian and ethnographer who wrote about the Plains Indians and other subjects of the American frontier. He had a special interest in the destruction of George Armstrong Custer's battalion at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, which became his lifelong obsession. Marquis' body of work is valued by historians for his recording of the life stories of several Plains Indians and his writing on their way of life, particularly those involved in the Custer fight, notably Wooden Leg in A Warrior Who Fought Custer. Marquis carried out this research at a time when few were interested in the Indian version of events, even though no American soldiers survived the Custer fight. Marquis' work is thus both unique and unrepeatable. Marquis developed his own theories regarding the history of the Cheyenne. One idea in particular, that many of Custer's men committed suicide when the situation became hopeless, proved to be highly controversial. This idea first surfaced in the Wooden Leg narrative, but was most fully developed in Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself, considered by Marquis to be his most important work and the culmination of his Custer research. The latter was not published during Marquis' life; much of his work did not appear in print until the 1970s. The last book to be published, The Cheyennes of Montana (pub. 1978), is regarded as especially valuable by historians. In 2006 of a collection of his photographs was published as, A Northern Cheyenne Album. Marquis was born in Missouri and trained for a career as a printworker. He moved to Montana because he wanted an adventure in the West, but ended up staying there for the remainder of his life. At first he worked as an itinerant printer, but after getting married he trained in medicine and became a physician. The idea was to have a more settled lifestyle, especially after his first daughter was born, but Marquis seemed to have a wanderlust, frequently changing location and often considering a change of career (he qualified as an attorney at one point). This became especially apparent after his military service in World War I and the failure of his marriage. These moves were always within Montana, and his final location was in Hardin on the Crow Reservation close to the Custer battle site. He founded a museum there that has now been incorporated into the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument. Marquis first took up writing around the turn of the century, writing newspaper articles. In 1922 he was appointed agency physician to the Northern Cheyenne. He resigned after only ten weeks, but he was there long enough to realize that several participants of the Custer battle were still alive. Between 1923 and 1926 Marquis practiced medicine privately on the Crow Reservation but then tried to make writing his permanent career. Throughout his life Marquis was often in debt; his writing was sometimes interrupted by the need to earn money at medicine, or even his original career of typesetting. From 1926 he returned to his contacts among the Cheyenne, interviewing them in depth. The trust he developed with them allowed them to open up to him in a way they had not with any other outsiders. The result formed the bulk of Marquis' most important works. Early life Marquis was born December 19, 1869, on a farm near Osceola, Missouri. The family surname came from French ancestors who had been granted the hereditary title of Marquis. Marquis' great-great-grandfather was disinherited around 1768 for marrying beneath his station, to the daughter of an English merchant. With no prospects in France, he emigrated to Virginia, where he took Marquis as a surname.Weist, p. 23 Marquis' grandfather, James Marquis, was a minister in the Methodist Church who left the ministry to study medicine. His son, Marquis' father, Adonijah Cosner Marquis, also studied medicine; both James and Adonijah served as medical officers in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Adonijah served at the military hospital in Clinton, Missouri, where he met and married Sarah Ellen Westfall, the eldest daughter of a wealthy farming family from Vernon County, Missouri, who became Marquis' mother. After the war, Adonijah purchased a farm in Osceola; he returned to medical practice and left the running of the farm to employees. Marquis was the youngest of four children. His mother died before he was one year old. Although his father remarried soon after, Marquis was cared for by his maternal grandmother until he was four. He then joined his father and stepmother at their home in Roscoe, Missouri. Adonijah bought a half-share in the newspaper Osceola so that his son, Birney, Marquis' elder brother, could learn the printing trade. When he was old enough, Marquis did the same and could set type by the time he was thirteen. After leaving school in 1885, Marquis was sent, along with his sister Mollie, to the Weaubleau Christian Institute in Weaubleau, Missouri. He graduated in 1887.Weist, pp. 23‚Äì24 At first, Marquis was only able to find work as a teacher at a local one-room school. However, his brother found him work as a printer in St. Joseph. In February 1888 Marquis made the 150-mile journey to St. Joseph. This was the farthest the young man had ever been from home and his first experience of a big city.Weist, p. 24  Printworker  In St. Joseph Marquis worked for various newspapers, including the St. Joseph Daily News, the St. Joseph Gazette, and the St. Joseph Herald. It seems that work was easy to find as many printworkers had left the city after the printworkers union achieved a closed shop. Marquis' interest in the West was first sparked in 1890 by stories from three fellow printers who had spent a year there. Marquis and a colleague at the Herald resolved to save for a similar trip, working every shift available. In the end, however, the other printer dropped out and Marquis went alone. He boarded a train for Helena, Montana, on July 23, 1890, arriving on the 27th. He soon found temporary work at the Helena Independent- Record. It was in Helena that Marquis first met Native Americans. Perhaps more remarkably, it was there that he first experienced a Chinese restaurant.Weist, pp. 24‚Äì25 Later in 1890 Marquis traveled with another itinerant printer to Anaconda, Montana, where he again found temporary work with the Anaconda Standard. The Standard was the leading newspaper in Montana, financed by Marcus Daly, and built by campaigning editor John Hurst Durston.Swibold, pp. 4‚Äì10 By the end of the year Marquis had a permanent post at the Standard. In November 1892, he married Octavia Stewart Hillhouse, a granddaughter of Joseph Stewart, the first commandant of Alcatraz. Two years later Marquis decided to change to a more settled career and began the study of medicine.Weist, p. 25  Medicine  Marquis in 1916 In 1894, Marquis enrolled at University Medical College, Kansas City. A year of study was sufficient to allow him to practice medicine under the supervision of his father at Bosworth, Missouri, where the pair set up a practice and opened a drugstore. The practice was not very successful, so Marquis and his wife moved to Coloma where he worked under the supervision of another doctor. Marquis completed his studies with financial help from his wife's family and summer work as a printer in Anaconda. He graduated March 23, 1898, and returned to Montana. His daughter, Minnie-Ellen, was born soon after in Anaconda.Weist, p.25 Still struggling financially, Marquis looked for a more prosperous practice in Virginia City, Montana, where he became friends with Samuel V. Stewart. He decided to set up practice in nearby Ennis, a town he expected would grow substantially. When the practice became successful, he moved his family to Ennis, and was able to pay off his debts. It was in Ennis that Marquis first took up writing after becoming friends with Robert A. Vickers, the founder of the Alder Gulch Times. Marquis was a correspondent for the paper, submitting news that he had gathered on his medical rounds. Finding that Ennis was not expanding as he had expected, in 1904 he moved to Bozeman, but the move was not a success, and he again got into debt. Here a second daughter was born, Anna Rose Octavia. He had more success with a move to Clyde Park, where he established a well-respected practice. By 1910 he could afford to build a larger home for his family and exchanged horse and buggy transport for motor vehicles on his rounds. He occasionally addressed the Montana Medical Association conventions and acted as the Park County Health Officer. Marquis continued to write newspaper articles while at Clyde Park, mainly on historical or biographical themes.Weist, pp. 25‚Äì27 In 1915 Marquis' marriage began to fail. His family moved to Bozeman, leaving him without a receptionist, a role previously filled by his wife. At the same time, another practice had opened in Clyde Park, drawing away some of his business. In November 1916 Marquis closed his Clyde Park practice and moved to Livingston to share an office with the city health official.Weist, pp. 29‚Äì30 Law Marquis was an avid reader, and at Clyde Park his material included law books borrowed from attorney friends. In 1916 they persuaded him to sit the bar exam, which he passed. However, Marquis never made professional use of this qualification except for one case where he represented a Methodist minister suing an employer (of a second job) for back wages. After winning the case, Marquis promptly retired from that career so that he could claim that he was \\"100 percent successful as a lawyer\\", but he remained listed as a member of the Montana bar throughout his life.Weist, pp. 28‚Äì29  Army Medical Corps  When the US entered World War I in 1917, Marquis volunteered for the Army Medical Corps. While at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, for training in August, Marquis took the opportunity to study the civil war site of the Battle of Chickamauga, in which his uncle, Birney Marquis, had fought with the 39th Indiana Infantry Regiment. This may be an early indication of Marquis' interest in writing books.Weist, p.30 Marquis wished to be sent to France, but was required first to take a course in French. In the meantime, he was assigned to a convalescent hospital. Shortly before being sent overseas, Marquis was assigned to Camp Forrest in Lytle, Georgia,Crowell & Wilson, pp. 55, 70 an engineering camp, where he found himself treating victims of the beginning of the 1918 flu pandemic. Marquis arrived in England just as the war ended; the flu epidemic, however, had not. He continued to Cannes, where he was assigned the task of determining the capacity of hotels for use as hospitals. In January 1919 he was assigned to the Hotel Metropole as assistant to the attending surgeon. They were soon overwhelmed with influenza cases. Marquis himself came down with flu but continued working. He was reassigned to the Hotel Suisse in Nice, but, still ill, was ordered back to the US. During the long wait for transport home, he took up medical duties in Gironde, finally docking in the US in June.Weist, pp. 30‚Äì32 Cheyenne agency physician Following the end of his army service in 1919, Marquis was restless and unsure of his future path. He first restarted the practice at Livingston and sold the house at Clyde Park (retaining some land thereWeist, p. 42 as a legacy for his daughters). He then decided to move to Whitehall, where he spent more and more of his time writing, at first on his wartime experiences, and then short articles on diverse subjects collected into volumes. He also wrote short stories during this period. However, he could not find a publisher.Weist, pp. 32‚Äì33 In early 1922 Marquis started considering working as an Indian agency physician. This would both satisfy his longstanding interest in the Native Americans of the West, and provide a subject that might be of interest to publishers. In May, Marquis applied to the Civil Service Commission. While waiting, he began work on a novel, Boute, an unfinished story based on his wartime experiences. In June, Marquis was appointed agency physician to the Northern Cheyenne. He arrived in the agency village of Lame Deer, Montana, in early July.Weist, p. 33 Porcupine in 1910 The Cheyennes at this time were poverty-stricken and in poor health. Tuberculosis was rife. Marquis was mistrusted at first, as was white-man medicine in general, but he showed sympathy and understanding for them and quickly gained their confidence. He began keeping an \\"Indian diary\\", a record of the stories told to him by the Cheyennes. He often required an interpreter for the older Cheyennes who could not speak English. Much of this material was incorporated into his later book The Cheyennes of Montana. Among the older people who spoke to Marquis was Porcupine, the preacher who brought the Ghost Dance religion to the Cheyenne. Another important informant was Willis Rowland, a mixed-blood, former army scout and interpreter. Rowland had been interpreter to George Bird Grinnell, author of The Cheyenne Indians: Their History and Ways of Life.Weist, p.34 Marquis began taking photographs of Cheyenne life and people. Many of these images would be published long after Marquis' death by anthropologist Margot Liberty in A Northern Cheyenne Album.Mader, 2007, p. 299 This habit of taking photos led to Marquis being given the Indian name \\"White Man Doctor Makes Pictures\\". However, Marquis found that he often had to explain the meaning to puzzled new Cheyenne acquaintances (Indian names were expected to have a self-evident meaning).Marquis, 1978, p. 184 It was during this period that Marquis became interested in the Battle of the Little Bighorn and the death of Custer. This interest became an obsession that was to last the rest of his life.Dippie, p. 138 The battle site was only twenty-five miles to the west on the Crow Indian Reservation. All the participants of the battle on the US side had died in action, but very little had been published in the way of Indian accounts. Most information had come from soldiers who only witnessed the aftermath. Marquis realized that there were a number of Cheyenne participants of the battle still alive on the reservation. However, interviewing them at length seemed too difficult at this time. There was the language barrier, and Marquis was busy as a doctor trying to cover a large area. As the particularly severe winter of 1922‚Äì23 started to close in, Marquis considered that the task had gone from difficult to impossible. He resigned his post and returned to Whitehall on September 27, having spent only ten weeks on the reservation. He arrived back in time to attend the wedding of his daughter Minnie-Ellen.Weist, pp. 34‚Äì35 Writing career=Crow agency physician The cold winters drove Marquis to consider yet another change of career (Whitehall is at an elevation of 4360 ft); he applied to the United States Veteran's Bureau. Meanwhile, he continued writing. He expanded his Indian diary into a book on the Cheyenne; he also wrote short stories and an article on \\"Reviewing the Story of Custer's Last Battle\\", the first of his many publications on this subject. In April 1923, he moved to Alberton, where he continued to practice medicine, and published a short story \\"Buffalo Heart, Indian Policeman\\", printed in The Youth's Companion, a leading literary magazine. In June, this success, and the better climate in Alberton, led him to turn down a job offer from the Veteran's Bureau and put most of his effort into work on his Cheyenne book. In May 1924 he had a second story, \\"The Guest of the Tribe\\", published in The Youth's Companion. However, Marquis was never really comfortable writing fiction.Weist, p. 40 What he really wanted to do was to write non-fiction about the Custer battle, and to do that he needed to be nearer to the scene. The opportunity came in June 1925 when the agency physician for the Crow Reservation suggested to him that there was room for another physician to set up practice there. In August, he set up a medical practice in Lodge Grass on the Crow Reservation.Weist, pp. 35‚Äì36 Leforge (left) and Marquis (right) in Indian Sign Language conversation In early September Marquis went to Lame Deer for the Cheyenne annual fair. There, Willis Rowland helped him compile a list of elderly Cheyennes. Although the Custer battlefield was on the Crow Reservation, the Crow had been on the US side during the Great Sioux War of 1876, of which the Custer battle was a part, and so would have no eyewitnesses to the battle, everybody fighting with Custer having been killed. Back in Lodge Grass, Marquis made two important contacts. In November, he had his first meeting with Thomas H. Leforge. Leforge lived among the Crow and had been a scout and interpreter for General Gibbon in the 1876 war. Leforge would be the subject of the first book Marquis succeeded in publishing, Memoirs of a White Crow Indian. The second contact was William H. White, who was with the Second Cavalry under Gibbon. White would be the subject of Custer, Cavalry & Crows.Weist, pp. 36‚Äì37 Marquis was now having some publishing success, including fiction in Lariat Story Magazine, non-fiction in Century Magazine (an article about Oscar Good Shot, an Oglala Sioux), and his first work of fiction not related to Indians, \\"The making of a garage doctor\\" in The American Motorist. However, he was clearly still torn concerning his future. The importance of Leforge and White to his writing career was not yet clear, and Marquis continued to look at other options. Besides his application to the Veteran's Bureau, he also looked for a post as agency physician (he was still practicing privately). Unable to get a post on the Crow reservation, he applied for a post with the Western Shoshone in Nevada. He changed his mind after some writing success and declined the post when it was offered, only to change his mind again and request the post. However, it was no longer available. Indian Sign Language Marquis was taught Indian Sign Language by the Crow. This would be a great help to him in his research as the language was common to all the plains tribes. Marquis also had lessons from John Stands in Timber, the Cheyenne tribal historian and grandson of Lame White Man, a Cheyenne chief killed in the battle with Custer. Together with co-author Margot Liberty, Stands in Timber published Cheyenne Memories shortly before he died in 1967. According to the Crow historian Joseph Medicine Crow, whose family were close friends of Marquis, Marquis would engage in animated sign language with Leforge while driving. This once caused an accident when Marquis rear-ended another vehicle while so distracted.Weist, pp. 37‚Äì38 Back to the Cheyenne In July 1926, a large payment from Century allowed him to move to Ashland, close to the Northern Cheyenne reservation. Marquis once again applied for a position at the Western Shoshone reservation, but when this was turned down in October he wrote, \\"rather glad than sorry to hear it\\", as his writing had progressed a great deal in the interim. He had met the father of Kate Big Head, a witness to the Custer battle about whom he would later write. Another new contact was Jules Chaudel, who had been with the Cheyenne scouts at Fort Keogh. In October, Marquis completed Memoirs of a White Crow Indian and submitted it to The Century Company. He then began working through Rowland's list of Cheyenne old enough to be informants about the Custer fight.Weist, p. 38 His first meeting was with Iron Teeth, said to be the oldest woman in the tribe. Next was Wooden Leg, a government-appointed tribal judge and another ex-scout. Wooden Leg had fought with the Cheyenne at the Battle of the Little Big Horn at the age of 18. In November, Marquis met James Tangled Yellow Hair.Weist, pp. 38‚Äì39 By January 1927, Marquis was working this material into a book that would eventually become The Cheyennes of Montana. There were to be chapters on Chaudel, Iron Teeth, Wooden Leg, and Tangled Yellow Hair. However, Marquis developed a particularly strong relationship with Wooden Leg, whose lengthy narrative eventually became a separate book, A Warrior Who Fought Custer. Also covered separately was Kate Big Head's narrative, published as She Watched Custer's Last Battle. Another narrative included in The Cheyennes is, \\"A Cheyenne Old Man\\". Though the man was not named by Marquis, a photograph of him was included in the book, and he was subsequently identified as Sun Bear, a veteran of both the Fetterman Fight and the Custer battle.Weist, pp. 39, 84 From April, Marquis began collecting artifacts of the Custer battle. He visited Cheyennes to buy objects that had been taken from the dead soldiers, particularly weapons. According to Weist, the fact that the Cheyennes would even admit that they had these objects was a measure of the trust Marquis had earned. Marquis also collected Cheyenne objects, including scalping knives. After attending the annual Sun Dance in Lame Deer, Marquis moved to Hardin, somewhat closer to the Custer battlefield.Weist, p. 39 Marquis' presence at that Sun Dance, and at others held in subsequent years until 1931, was another measure of the Cheyennes' trust. The Sun Dance (called by the Cheyenne the Great Medicine dance) had earlier been made illegal by the Federal Government; 1927 was the first year they had been allowed to hold it openly. It was still disapproved of, and practicing Indian medicine was a jailable offense. Hardin In October 1927, Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was accepted for publication by Century, and Marquis was prompted to take down his medical practice sign. However, this was premature, as it would be some time before royalties were forthcoming. Lack of funds drove Marquis to continue seeing patients and carrying out insurance medical examinations. He also needed to borrow money from relatives and cash in his war risk insurance policy. Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was published in April 1928 and received good reviews.Weist, pp. 40‚Äì41 The Cheyennes of Montana was submitted to Century in August, and A Warrior Who Fought Custer was submitted in October. However, in November Marquis was informed that the first six months' sales of Memoirs of a White Crow Indian had been poor, and the royalties were disappointing. There was now a danger that the other two books he had submitted to Century would not be published at all. A small success came in December with the publication of \\"Red Ripe's Squaw\\" in Century Magazine, it was an abridged version of the Iron Teeth narrative. At the end of February 1929 Marquis received a much-needed payment of $150 for this work. James Willard Schultz and his son Lone Wolf, 1884 In the meantime, Marquis was spending a great deal of time on his research into the Custer battle. He now had a dozen Cheyenne informants, including Wooden Leg. With them, from June 1928, communicating mainly with sign language or through interpreters, he consulted maps and went on field trips to the battle site. He also corresponded with George Bird Grinnell, Generals Hugh L. Scott and Edward S. Godfrey, and with Custer's widow Elizabeth Custer. He also started loaning out some of his Custer memorabilia for exhibitions. Personal contacts during this period included Laton Alton Huffman, a well-known Montana frontier photographer, W. H. Banfill of the Billings Gazette, who wrote Western history articles, artist and author Will James, and James Willard Schultz, author and explorer.Weist, pp. 42‚Äì44 In June 1929 Marquis was putting together a new book about William H. White, Custer, Cavalry & Crows, which involved more interviews. He found a publisher in April 1930, the Midwest Company of Minneapolis, but the publication date was not until spring, 1931, and Marquis would not receive royalties until a year after publication, so money continued to be tight. Upset, Marquis retired to a cabin in Laurel. Better news came in August 1930. The Midwest Company accepted A Warrior Who Fought Custer for publication. They wished to publish it in the spring instead of Custer, Cavalry & Crows, whose publication would be delayed until a later date. Although the latter was now delayed for a second time, both books were certain to be published. In the meantime, Marquis, perpetually short of funds, moved to a small cabin on the property of his brother, Addie Marquis, in Bozeman. Here he spent some of his time setting type at a printing shop that employed his cousin, Nige Garrison, to whom he owed money.Weist, pp. 43‚Äì44 A Warrior Who Fought Custer was published in April 1931 to mostly good reviews. However, W. J. Ghent, writing in the New York Times, criticized the claim made by Wooden Leg that many of Custer's men had committed suicide rather than face death at the hands of the Indians. Although sales of the Wooden Leg book did well, better than Marquis had expected, this controversy was to prove a hindrance to his chances of future book publications. Marquis believed he had multiple Indian sources verifying this account, and there were no surviving whites to contradict it. He planned to develop the idea more fully in a future book, eventually to become Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself.Weist, pp. 44‚Äì46 Marquis' publications during 1932 were articles published in the Billings Gazette, starting with an article on Leforge. Marquis submitted around 50 articles about the American West, with a particular emphasis on Indians and the Custer battle. Most of these articles were reworked, previously unpublished drafts. The articles were later syndicated by the Montana Newspaper Association. After the death of Banfill in August 1933, Marquis' articles became a regular feature to fill that gap.Weist, p. 46 Custer museum Marquis continued to display and loan out his Custer artifacts. He had been considering for some time making more permanent arrangements for his collection of objects and photographs. In July 1932, with the aid of a loan from his younger daughter, Octavia, he came to an arrangement with the manager of a Custer tourist camp in Hardin. Marquis was given a two-room cabin; he lived in one room, and the other was used to display the collection. The camp planned to build a gift shop and Marquis' museum was expected to attract customers to it.Weist, pp. 44‚Äì45 In March 1933, Marquis claimed squatter's right on a nearby piece of land. He opened his Custer Battle Museum in April and moved to the property. He began publishing his own pamphlets for sale at the museum and the Custer battlefield. Titles in 1933 were: Sketch Story of the Custer Battle, She Watched Custer's Last Battle, Custer Soldiers Not Buried, and Which Indian Killed Custer?, in 1934 Sitting Bull and Gall the Warrior, and in 1935 Two Days After the Custer Battle.Weist, pp. 46‚Äì47 Last book In December 1933, Marquis began his last book, Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself: The True Story of Custer's Last Stand. Marquis considered this his most important work ‚Äì the subject was his central interest and he regarded much of his previous work as mere preparation for it. The book was completed in March 1934. However, his publisher, the Midwest Company, went out of business shortly afterwards. In November, Marquis realized that he had a heart problem but continued to work. In January 1935, he wrote a new chapter for his still-unpublished book The Cheyennes of Montana, titled \\"Custer Battle Cheyennes\\". In addition to this and his new book, he was still looking for a publisher for Custer, Cavalry & Crows. On March 22, while recovering from influenza, he died of a heart attack. He was buried at the Custer Battlefield National Cemetery with a military funeral.Weist, p. 47 Legacy=Value to scholars Marquis' body of work is of value to scholars researching the Plains Indians' way of life in general, especially the Cheyennes, and the Custer fight at Little Bighorn. Marquis was himself aware of this importance: in a letter to his daughters shortly before his death, he emphasizes that he was the only person recording the stories of the only eyewitnesses to the Custer battle: His biographer, Thomas D. Weist, agrees, saying that even after his books had gone out of print, \\"anthropologists, historians, and avid readers of western history continued to seek them out in libraries for their myriad details on the Cheyennes, the Crows, and the Battle of the Little Bighorn.\\"Weist, p. 48 Edgar I. Stewart says Marquis is \\"one of the ablest students of the American Indian\\".Stewart, p. viii Liberty says that he is \\"well trusted generally, as a historian ...\\"\\"Thomas B. Marquis, physician- photographer\\", in Liberty, 2006 She singles out his final piece of work, the \\"Custer Battlefield Cheyennes\\", as being of special interest to American Indian Wars scholars.\\"So Who Was Marquis?\\", in Liberty, 2006 It is not just the Custer fight; Marquis is also known for recording the earlier life on the plains of the Cheyenne and stories of survivors of the later Northern Cheyenne Exodus.Leiker & Powers, p. 128 Such praise can also be found in the remarks of those critical of Marquis' suicide theory. Richard G. Hardorff wrote in 1994: \\"Be that as it may, it is beyond doubt that the contributions made by Marquis to our historical knowledge far outweigh these possible shortcomings.\\"Hardorff, p. 17 Even Ghent's highly critical review of the Wooden Leg book concedes that it is \\"a deeply interesting story\\", with his criticism reserved for the description of the Custer fight only. By 1945, all of Marquis' works were out of print. However, the Wooden Leg narrative was reprinted as Wooden Leg: A Warrior Who Fought Custer in 1962 by the University of Nebraska Press. In 1967 Marquis' daughters published his collected pamphlets as Custer on the Little Bighorn. Part of his Cheyenne book was published as The Reminiscences of Four Indians and a White Soldier in 1973, and Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was reprinted in 1974. Marquis' unpublished books also eventually came into print; Custer, Cavalry & Crows in 1975, Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself: The True Story of Custer's Last Stand in 1976, and The Cheyennes of Montana in 1978, 43 years after his death. The last of these included an introduction and 26-page biography of Marquis by Thomas D. Weist. Weist remains the main source of published information on Marquis. In 2003 a new edition of Wooden Leg: A Warrior Who Fought Custer was published with an introduction by Richard Littlebear, Cheyenne writer, educator, and president of Chief Dull Knife College.E. Fox, p. 212 The value of Marquis' work was properly recognized only after his death. Liberty and others believe that it took so long to publish much of his work because of his controversial theory on the suicide of Custer's men.\\"So Who Was Marquis?\\" in Liberty, 2006 Historian Brian Dippie suggests that the Great Depression may also have been a contributing factor. Preserving Marquis' collection Shortly before his death, Marquis urged his daughters, Octavia and Minnie-Ellen, to try and preserve his Custer museum collection. They donated most of the collection to the US Government, and it is now part of the permanent display at the visitor center of the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument.Weist, pp. 47‚Äì48 Some of Marquis' photographs appeared in his books, but most remained unpublished.Dippie, p. 139 Marquis' daughters gave the negatives (about five hundred of them) to John Woodenlegs. Woodenlegs was the grandson of Wooden Leg, the subject of Marquis' book A Warrior Who Fought Custer. He was an educator, tribal president from 1955 to 1968, and founder of Chief Dull Knife College. Woodenlegs, unsure what to do with the material, passed them to Weist, who at the time was writing a Cheyenne history for use in reservation schools. The negatives were contained in a battered shoebox, and some were in poor condition. Weist involved photographer Jerry Mader to work on their restoration. Weist, Mader, and Woodenlegs began a project in the 1960s to make the images available in reservation schools. Without funds for publication, however, the project was abandoned in 1981 on the death of Woodenlegs. Weist died in 1994.US Social Security Death Index 1935‚Äì2014 The negatives were passed to anthropologist Margot Liberty in 1998 by a remaining project member, Elizabeth Wilson Clark, shortly before her death. Liberty had been a teacher at the Northern Cheyenne reservation in the 1950s, and she agreed to edit the material into a book for the University of Oklahoma Press. Finally, 142 of the images were published in 2006 as A Northern Cheyenne Album. The book includes a commentary from Woodenlegs recorded years before. The negatives were sold by Hap Gilliland of the Council for Indian Education to the Buffalo Bill Historical Center museum in Cody, Wyoming.Liberty, Marquis, & Woodenlegs, p. xiv Mader complained that the negatives had been a gift to the Cheyenne people, and that their proper home was in the John Woodenlegs Memorial Library in Lame Deer on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. The Smithsonian Institution and The Little Bighorn National Monument museum hold a few other Marquis negatives. The photographs are not of uniformly good quality. Dippie says that some are \\"... at first glance, seemingly candidates for the discard pile\\". But he goes on to say that their true value is in their depiction of everyday Cheyenne life in the reservation period in ways that posed portraits do not. On the other hand, Dippie adds, there are some \\"that would rival the best efforts of a studio portraitist\\". He concludes by saying that \\"[a]nyone interested in Plains Indian history will want to own [the book]\\". Liberty says that on first being sent the photographs it \\"was clear that they were of great historical value\\". For instance, there are pictures of veteran fighters in old age, the remnants from before the surrender of the Cheyenne. There are also images of the Sun Dance and the Animal Dance. The latter no longer exists, and photography is now prohibited at the former.Reece & Liberty, 2006 Suicide controversy Grave markers at Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument The theory that Custer's soldiers committed suicide en masse toward the end of the Battle of the Little Bighorn has been controversial from the moment it was first suggested, and the discussion continues. The notion was so controversial that Marquis could not find a publisher for Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself, his main vehicle for promoting the theory, and the book did not appear in print until 1976, forty years after his death. The earliest criticism comes with Ghent's review in the New York Times of the Wooden Leg book after its first publication in 1931. \\"No student of the battle is likely to accept any of the new revelations.\\" Ghent is dismissive of the value of Indians as eyewitnesses: \\"... he tells what he remembers, along with much that he has imagined ...\\" and insists that the \\"body of authenticated fact is in no danger of being disturbed by any new material from any source\\".Ghent, p. BR7 Weist describes this review as \\"somewhat supercilious\\" and goes on to point out that Marquis has many other witnesses confirming the story, and that the only eyewitnesses are Indians. Marquis names a dozen of these in the introduction to the Wooden Leg book, one of whom, Sun Bear, gives a similar account in The Cheyennes of Montana.Marquis, 1978, p. 86 However, Marquis has many other critics who say he either exaggerated the role played by suicide or is entirely mistaken. Ghent's mistrust of Indians as reliable witnesses was commonplace in the period; According to Hardorff, the theory is discounted by most academics.Hardorff, p. 16 He suggests that Marquis may have made errors due to the use of sign language, which, he claims, cannot convey the nuances of language. In his book, Wooden Leg unambiguously relates a tale of mass suicide. He discusses possible causes of the suicides at length. It puzzled him because the idea of suicide to avoid capture was unknown to the Indians.Marquis, footnote in Wooden Leg, p. 246 Attributing the soldier's suicides to the effects of whisky was a common theory among the Indians, although Wooden Leg believed the prayers of medicine men to have been the cause. Wooden Leg's only taste of whisky up to the time of the battle had been a mouthful ‚Äì which he immediately spat out ‚Äì that he took from a captured bottle. In later life, Wooden Leg changed his mind and subscribed to the whisky theory after experiencing the effects of alcohol first-hand.Wooden Leg, pp. 47, 246 Richard Fox and others note that while Wooden Leg's version is corroborated by the oral tradition of other Cheyenne witnesses, notably that of Kate Big Head, a young woman who witnessed the battle, there is no corroboration in the oral tradition of the Sioux. Fox concludes that \\"quite simply, the contention is nonsense. A few troopers undoubtedly took their own lives, but it is hard to know what factors fostered the idea of wholesale suicide\\".Fox, p. 136 Fox in his turn has been criticized for selectively using Indian oral tradition when it suits him, but discarding it as nonsense when he finds it disagreeable.Elliot, p. 308, quoting Koury According to Liberty, the soldiers' fear that Indians would torture prisoners was unfounded. \\"Plains Indian warriors as a rule took as captives only women and children, killing male opponents outright.\\" However, Liberty goes on to say that the possibility of torture was widely believed by Custer's men. She says that Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself is well researched by Marquis, but is often not consulted merely because of the title. Another suggestion is that the Cheyenne warriors, pressed to recount details of the Custer battle, were still reluctant to admit to killing soldiers for fear of punishment. A simple way out of this dilemma was to say when questioned by non-Indians that most of the soldiers died at their own hands.Elliot, p. 308, quoting Barnett Researchers Fox and Thom Hatch say that Wooden Leg retracted the claim in later life; this would have been in extreme old age, as he had still not recanted at the age of 73 when the book was written, other than to say it was whisky that was the cause rather than prayer.Wooden Leg, p. 379 In his book Cheyenne Memories, John Stands In Timber, tribal historian for the Northern Cheyenne, agrees: \\"Wooden Leg said some other things (in his book) he took back later. One was that the soldiers were drunk, and many killed themselves. I went with two army men to see him one time. They wanted to find out about it. I interpreted ... and we asked him if it were true that the Indians said the soldiers did that. He laughed and said there were just too many Indians. The soldiers did their best. He said if they had been drunk they would not have killed as many as they did. But it was in the book.\\"Stands In Timber & Liberty, p. 205 Archaeologists have attempted to test the suicide theory, particularly by the examination of the remains of skulls, but have been unable to reach a conclusion. The suicide theory cannot be ruled out by the archaeological evidence, but there is no evidence to support it, either.Scott, p. 280 Other controversies Another of Ghent's criticisms of the Wooden Leg narrative concerns the manner of the death of Tom Custer, brother of Colonel Custer, at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Ghent's reasons for disbelieving are not made clear, other than that the source is an Indian. Wooden Leg describes a decapitated body with \\"paint markings\\" in the skin. From the detailed description of these tattoos, and the buckskin clothing, Marquis identifies the body as Tom Custer.Marquis, footnote in Wooden Leg, pp. 239‚Äì240 This criticism does not seem to have been taken up by other scholars. Tom Custer's biography describes the decapitation and the identification from tattoos as facts without further comment.Day, pp. 269‚Äì270 Liberty discusses the controversies surrounding Marquis in great detail, but fails to even mention Tom Custer.Liberty, 2006 Liberty lists a number of Marquis' claims about the Cheyenne that are either doubted or are just generally little known. First among these is that the Sioux believed, according to Marquis, that the Great Sioux War of 1876 was a war against the Cheyenne by the United States. The US certainly thought they were mainly fighting the Sioux, and the conventional view of historians is that the Sioux were central to the action. Without doubt, the Sioux had the greatest number of participants on the Indian side, but, according to Marquis, they thought they were merely coming to the aid of their allies the Cheyenne.\\"Thomas B. Marquis, Physician-Photographer\\", in Liberty, 2006 Liberty points out that the Sioux would have had some justification in this belief; the number of Cheyenne villages destroyed far exceeded the number of Sioux villages, even though the Cheyenne were fewer in number. Liberty includes this idea within her overall concept of \\"Cheyenne Primacy\\" ‚Äì that the Cheyennes were the most important group in the historical development of the Northern Plains.\\"Forenote\\", in Liberty 2006 According to Liberty, the Marquis idea most likely to be disbelieved is his claim that the Northern Cheyennes held a conference with their bitter enemies, the Crows, in July 1875 to discuss territorial borders. However, Liberty thinks that even this idea is worthy of further consideration, and offers other evidence of a slow thaw in Cheyenne‚ÄìCrow relations. Of the controversial ideas concerning the Cheyenne as a whole, Liberty concludes that, Selected works * (with Thomas H.

The Testimonies  The declaration reads: : :'''' :: :There is no deity but God. : :'''' :: :Muhammad is the messenger of God. The above two statements are commonly prefaced by the phrase a≈°hadu  æan (\\"I bear witness that\\"), yielding the full form: : :'''' :: :I bear witness that there is no deity but God, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of God. : Shia Islam may include the third testimony of:The Later Mughals by William Irvine p. 130 : :'''' :: :Ali is the vicegerent of God. Resulting in: : :'''' :: :I bear witness that there is no deity but God, I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of God, and I bear witness that Ali is the vicegerent of God.  Terminology and significance  In the English translation‚Äî\\"There is no god but God. Muhammad is the messenger of God.\\"‚Äîthe first, lower-case occurrence of \\"god\\" or \\"deity\\" is a translation of the Arabic word ilah, while the capitalized second and third occurrences of \\"God\\" are translations of the Arabic word Allah, meaning \\"the God\\". The noun ≈°ahƒÅdah (), from the verbal root ≈°ahida ( ) meaning \\"to observe, witness, testify\\", translates as \\"testimony\\" in both the everyday and the legal senses. The Islamic creed is also called, in the dual form, ≈°ahƒÅdatƒÅn (, literally \\"two testimonies\\"). The expression al-≈°ahƒ´d (, \\"the Witness\\") is used in the Quran as one of the \\"titles of God\\". In Sunni Islam, the Shahada has two parts: lƒÅ  æilƒÅha  æillƒÅ -llƒÅh (There is no deity except God), and mu·∏•ammadun ras≈´lu llƒÅh (Muhammad is the messenger of God), which are sometimes referred to as the first Shahada and the second Shahada. The first statement of the Shahada is also known as the tahlƒ´l. In Shia Islam, the Shahada also has a third part, a phrase concerning Ali, the first Shia Imam and the fourth Rashid caliph of Sunni Islam: ( ), which translates to \\"Ali is the wali of God\\".The Later Mughals by William Irvine p. 130 In the Quran, the first statement of the Shahadah takes the form lƒÅ  æilƒÅha  æillƒÅ llƒÅh twice (37:35, 47:19), and  æallƒÅhu lƒÅ  æilƒÅha  æillƒÅ huwa (God, there is no deity but Him) much more often. Nasr et al (2015). The Study Quran. HarperOne. p. 110. (Footnote 255) It appears in the shorter form lƒÅ  æilƒÅha  æillƒÅ huwa (There is no deity but Him) in many places.Nasr et al (2015). The Study Quran. HarperOne. p. 1356. (Footnote 22) It appears in these forms about 30 times in the Quran, and never attached with the other parts of the Shahada in Sunni or Shia Islam or \\"in conjunction with another name\\".Edip Yuksel, et al (2007). Quran: A Reformist Translation. Brainbrow Press. Footnote 3:18. Islam's monotheistic nature is reflected in the first sentence of the Shahada, which declares belief in the oneness of God and that he is the only entity truly worthy of worship. The second sentence of the Shahada indicates the means by which God has offered guidance to human beings. The verse reminds Muslims that they accept not only the prophecy of Muhammad but also the long line of prophets who preceded him. While the first part is seen as a cosmic truth, the second is specific to Islam, as it is understood that members of the older Abrahamic religions do not view Muhammad as one of their prophets. The Shahada is a statement of both ritual and worship. In a well-known hadith, Muhammad defines Islam as witnessing that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is God's messenger, giving of alms (zakat), performing the ritual prayer, fasting during the month of Ramadan, and making a pilgrimage to the Kaaba: the Five Pillars of Islam are inherent in this declaration of faith.  Recitation  Recitation of the Shahadah is the most common statement of faith for Muslims. Sunnis, Shia Twelvers, as well as Isma'ilis consider it as one of the Five Pillars of Islam. It is whispered by the father into the ear of a newborn child, and it is whispered into the ear of a dying person. The five canonical daily prayers each include a recitation of the Shahada. Recitation of the Shahada in front of witnesses is also the first and only formal step in conversion to Islam. This occasion often attracts more than the two required witnesses and sometimes includes a celebration to welcome the convert into their new faith. In accordance with the central importance played by the notion of intention (, niyyah) in Islamic doctrine, the recitation of the Shahada must reflect understanding of its import and heartfelt sincerity. Intention is what differentiates acts of devotion from mundane acts and a simple reading of the Shahada from invoking it as a ritual activity.  Origin  Though the two statements of the Shahada are both present in the Quran (for example, 37:35 and 48:29), they are not found there side by side as in the Shahada formula. Versions of both phrases began to appear in coins and monumental architecture in the late seventh century, which suggests that it had not been officially established as a ritual statement of faith until then. An inscription in the Dome of the Rock (est. 692) in Jerusalem reads: \\"There is no god but God alone; He has no partner with him; Muhammad is the messenger of God\\". Another variant appears in coins minted after the reign of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, the fifth Umayyad caliph: \\"Muhammad is the servant of God and His messenger\\". Although it is not clear when the Shahada first came into common use among Muslims, it is clear that the sentiments it expresses were part of the Quran and Islamic doctrine from the earliest period.  In Sufism  The Shahada has been traditionally recited in the Sufi ceremony of dhikr (, \\"remembrance\\"), a ritual that resembles mantras found in many other religious traditions. During the ceremony, the Shahada may be repeated thousands of times, sometimes in the shortened form of the first phrase where the word 'Allah' (\\"God\\") is replaced by 'huwa' (\\"Him\\"). The chanting of the Shahada sometimes provides a rhythmic background for singing.  In architecture and art  The Shahada appears as an architectural element in Islamic buildings around the world, such as those in Jerusalem, Cairo, and Istanbul. Late-medieval and Renaissance European art displays a fascination with Middle Eastern motifs in general and the Arabic script in particular, as indicated by its use, without concern for its content, in painting, architecture and book illustrations. In his San Giovenale Triptych, the Italian Renaissance artist Masaccio copied the full Shahada, written backwards, on the halo of the Madonna.  Usage on flags  Jihadist variation of the Black Standard as used by various Islamist organisations since the late 1990s, which consists of the Shahada in white script centered on a black background. The Shahada is found on some Islamic flags. Wahhabis have used the Shahada on their flags since the 18th century. In 1902, ibn Saud, leader of the House of Saud and the future founder of Saudi Arabia, added a sword to this flag. The modern Flag of Saudi Arabia was introduced in 1973. The Flag of Somaliland has a horizontal strip of green, white and red with the Shahada inscribed in white on the green strip. Between 1997 and 2001, the Taliban used a white flag with the Shahada inscribed in black as the flag of their Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. The various jihadist black flags used by Islamic insurgents since the 2000s have often followed this example. The Shahada written on a green background has been used by supporters of Hamas since about 2000. The 2004 draft constitution of Afghanistan proposed a flag featuring the Shahada in white script centered on a red background. In 2006, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant designed its flag using the Shahada phrase written in white on black background. The font used is supposedly similar to the font used as seal on the original letters written on Muhammad's behalf.

Nambi Narayanan (12 December 1941) is an Indian scientist and aerospace engineer and Padma Bhushan award winner. As a senior official at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), he was in-charge of the cryogenics division. In 1994, he was falsely charged with espionage and arrested. The charges against him were dismissed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in April 1996, and the Supreme Court of India declared him not guilty in 1998. In 2018, the Supreme Court, through the bench of Dipak Misra, awarded Narayanan a compensation of 5,000,000 (roughly US$70,000), to be recovered from the government of Kerala within eight weeks. However the government of Kerala decided to give him 1.3 crore ( 13,000,000; roughly US$183,000). The apex court also constituted a committee headed by retired Supreme Court judge D. K. Jain to inquire into the role of officials of the Kerala police in the arrest of Narayanan. He was awarded India's third highest civilian award, the Padma Bhushan, in 2019.  Early life  S. Nambi Narayanan was born on 12 December 1941 to Tamil Brahmin parents in Nagercoil, in present-day Kanyakumari District of Tamil Nadu, where he also completed his schooling. His family traces its roots to Tirukurungudi village in Tirunelveli District of Tamil Nadu. Career Narayanan first met Vikram Sarabhai, the then Chairman of ISRO, in 1966 at the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station in Thumba, Thiruvananthapuram, while he worked as a payload integrator with Y. S. Rajan there. Also chairman of the Space Science and technology Centre (SSTC) at the time, Sarabhai only recruited highly qualified professionals. In pursuit, Narayanan enrolled at the College of Engineering in Thiruvananthapuram for his MTech degree. Upon learning this, Sarabhai offered him leave for higher education if he made it to any of the Ivy League universities. Subsequently, Narayanan earned a NASA fellowship and was accepted into Princeton University in 1969. He completed his master's program there in chemical rocket propulsion under professor Luigi Crocco in a record ten months. Despite being offered a job in the US, Narayanan returned to India with expertise in liquid propulsion at a time when Indian rocketry was still solely dependent on solid propellants. Narayanan introduced the liquid fuel rocket technology in India in the early 1970s, when A. P. J. Abdul Kalam's team was working on solid motors. He foresaw the need for liquid fuelled engines for ISRO's future civilian space programmes, and received encouragement from the then ISRO chairman Satish Dhawan, and his successor U. R. Rao. Narayanan developed liquid propellant motors, first building a successful thrust engine in the mid-1970s and thereafter moving on to bigger engines. In 1992, India signed an agreement with Russia for transfer of technology to develop cryogenic fuel- based engines and procurement of two such engines for 235 crore. However, it did not materialize after the US president George H. W. Bush wrote to Russia, raising objections against the transfer of technology and even threatening to blacklist the country from the select-five club. Russia, under Boris Yeltsin, succumbed to the pressure and denied the technology to India. To bypass this monopoly, India signed a new agreement with Russia to fabricate four cryogenic engines, alongside two mockups for a total of 9 million, after floating a global tender without a formal transfer of technology. ISRO had already reached a consensus with Kerala Hitech Industries Limited which would have provided the cheapest tender for fabricating engines. But this failed to materialize due to the spy scandal of 1994. After working for nearly two decades, with French assistance, Narayanan's team developed the Vikas engine used by several ISRO rockets including the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) that took Chandrayaan-1 to the moon in 2008. The Vikas engine is used in the second stage of PSLV and as the second and the four strap-on stages of Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV).  Espionage charges  In 1994, Narayanan was charged with leaking vital defence secrets to two alleged Maldivian intelligence officers, Mariam Rasheeda and Fauzia Hassan. Defense officials said the secrets pertained to highly confidential \\"flight test data\\" from experiments with rocket and satellite launches. Narayanan was among two scientists (the other being D. Sasikumaran) that were accused of selling the secrets for millions. However, his house seemed nothing out of the ordinary and did not show signs of the corrupt gains he was accused of. Narayanan was arrested and spent 48 days in jail. He claims that officials from the Intelligence Bureau, who were the ones to interrogate him, wanted him to make false accusations against the top brass of ISRO. He alleges that two IB officials had asked him to implicate A. E. Muthunayagam, his boss and then Director of the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC). When he refused to comply, he was tortured until he collapsed and was hospitalised. He says his main complaint against ISRO is that it did not support him. Krishnaswamy Kasturirangan, who was ISRO chairman at the time stated that ISRO could not interfere in a legal matter. In May 1996, the charges were dismissed as phony by the CBI. They were also dismissed by the Supreme Court in April 1998. In September 1999, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) passed strictures against the government of Kerala for having damaged Narayanan's distinguished career in space research along with the physical and mental torture to which he and his family were subjected. After the dismissal of charges against them, the two scientists, Sasikumar and Narayanan were transferred out of Thiruvananthapuram and were given desk jobs. In 2001, the NHRC ordered the government of Kerala to pay him a compensation of 1 crore.A shattered man now sits cool and detached. The Hindu, 8 September 2012. He retired in 2001. The Kerala High Court ordered a compensation amount of Rs 10 lakhs to be paid to Nambi Narayanan based on an appeal from NHRC India on September 2012. On 3 October 2012, The Hindu reported that the government of Kerala had dropped charges against the police officials who were alleged to have falsely implicated Narayanan in the espionage case on the grounds that over 15 years had passed since the case was initiated. The top officer involved in the case, Siby Mathews, was later appointed Chief Information Commissioner in Kerala (2011 - 2016). It was reported on 8 November 2012 that the government of Kerala had not complied with the Kerala High Court order to pay a compensation Rs 10 lakhs. Demand for Justice On 7 November 2013, Narayanan pushed for justice in his case, seeking to expose those behind the conspiracy. He says that this case will 'discourage' the youth. On 14 September 2018, the Supreme Court appointed a three-member panel headed by its former judge to probe the \\"harrowing\\" arrest and alleged torture of former space scientist Nambi Narayanan in the 'ISRO spy scandal' that turned out to be fake.

Origins and history Rivington Place was commissioned by two publicly funded visual arts organisations, Iniva and Autograph ABP, with the intention of establishing the new venue as a major international visual arts centre in Shoreditch, London. In the late 20th century, this part of the East End emerged as a new arts quarter, famous for harbouring the YBA movement, with leading private galleries such as White Cube in nearby Hoxton Square. Both Iniva and Autograph were founded to reflect and promote cultural diversity in the visual arts, and it was hoped that the new building would advance this aim. The five-storey building was designed by leading architect David Adjaye and opened to the public on 5 October 2007. It cost ¬£8 million to complete and was the first publicly funded new-build international art gallery in London since the Hayward Gallery opened more than 40 years earlier. Function and activities Primarily a free public gallery, for most of the year, the two exhibition spaces are used to show contemporary visual art shows.

History of the IoCF The Institute was established as a result of the initial directive given in The Registration Review White Paper published in January 2002 entitled Civil Registration: Vital Change See Civil Registration: Vital Change Chapter 4, New Services, and the need to drive upwards the quality of funeral ceremonies in the UK by furthering the provision of Civil Funerals and supporting the work of Civil Funeral Celebrants. April 2002 saw the launch of the then new Civil Funeral ceremony being offered for the first time in England, this was in response to a recognised widening gap between the changing needs of society and the range of funeral ceremonies available. Aims and objectives of the IoCF As well as offering choice, a key objective of the IoCF is to identify those spheres where there are particularly traumatic or difficult circumstances surrounding a funeral that call for specialist knowledge, such as ceremonies involving retained organs, stillbirth or pre-term babies, suicides and homicide victims. Definition of a Civil Funeral The IoCF defines the Civil Funeral as \\"A funeral which is driven by the wishes, beliefs and values of the deceased and their family, not by the beliefs or ideology of the person conducting the funeral\\". This means that members of the Institute, known in a professional capacity as Civil Funeral Celebrants, conduct non-religious funeral ceremonies as well as funeral ceremonies including religious material, if this is a preference expressed by the deceased or the bereaved. The Civil Funeral Ceremony is designed and conducted in such a way as to reflect the express wishes of the deceased and that of the family. Civil Funeral Celebrants Civil Funeral Celebrants lead the funeral ceremony and work in consultation with the family and the Funeral Director. The Institute's Council of Management views quality of performance by is celebrants as key and in recognition of this, Celebrants adhere to the Institute's Code of Practice and are assessed annually to retain their membership.

Forty-two of the sixty cardinals participated in the conclave. The absence of thirty percent of the cardinalate makes this conclave one of the most sparsely attended in the history of the modern Roman Catholic Church. Fourteen of Gregory XIII's thirty cardinals failed to attend, a startlingly high number. Proceedings The conclave began in the Vatican on 21 April, Easter Sunday. At the opening ceremonies, out of sixty living cardinals thirty-nine were in attendance. Three more arrived later, in time to cast a vote: Andreas of Austria, Ludovico Madruzzo of Trent, and Guido Luca Ferrero of Vercelli. Two factions quickly formed. The first was led by Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici and the second by Luigi d'Este (grandson of King Louis XII of France). They were willing to combine to make a pope, but it depended on whether they could agree on a common candidate. Early voting seemed to favour Cardinals Pier Donato Cesi and Guglielmo Sirleto, but by the next morning they had been abandoned. Wanting to avoid the potential influence of cardinals who had not yet arrived, Medici then proposed two names to D' Este: those of Cardinals Albani and Montalto, and invited him to choose. D' Este imposed conditions, however, and the projected deal, when news got out, caused much indignation. Through a series of misdirections and strategems, Medici convinced the cardinals that Montalto was not his candidate. Ludovico Cardinal Madruzzo, who was the designated leader of the Spanish faction, then arrived in Rome and had conversations with the Spanish and Imperial ambassadors before he entered conclave. Meeting immediately with d' Este, Madruccio learned of d' Este's dislike of his own favorite, Sirleto. Considering that a completely pro-Spanish pope would be as unpalatable as a completely pro-French one, he therefore declared himself to d'Este to be against Cardinal Albani, and thus in favor of Montalto. Altemps, Medici and Gesualdo then put pressure on Madruccio as well, and he was won over. As leader of the Spanish interest, he brought his own influence to bear on Andrew of Austria, Colonna, Deza (Seza), Gonzaga, Sfondrati and Spinola. With all of these adherents, Medici and d'Este still needed four votes. These could only be had in the group of Gregory XIII's cardinals organized by Alessandro Farnese, the Dean of the College of Cardinals. During that night, Cardinal Ferrero arrived. On 24 April Medici explained to Montalto all that had been done, and advised him as to how affairs should be conducted. D'Este met with Farnese, who believed that Montalto had no voting strength, and managed to further misdirect him. During a meeting in the Pauline Chapel, d' Este recruited Guastavillani, the Cardinal Camerlengo; Giambattista Castagna, the Cardinal of San Marcello; and Francesco Sforza. When the cardinals finally assembled in the Sistine Chapel, d' Este declared that it was not necessary to proceed to a ballot, since it was obvious who the new pope was. Without opposition the cardinals proceeded to do hommage ('adoration') to Felice Cardinal Peretti though, immediately afterwards, a vote was conducted by asking each cardinal to cast his vote aloud. The vote was unanimous. Cardinal Fran√ßois de Joyeuse arrived in Rome too late to participate in the Conclave. The coronation of Sixtus V took place on May 1. As senior cardinal deacon Cardinal de' Medici placed the tiara on his head. On May 5, he took possession of the Lateran.

He was a Fellow of the Statistical Society and worked with Surgeon-General Henry Marshall and Sir Graham Balfour on army statistics. In the 1850s he went with Sir John McNeill to the Crimea, and worked with Florence Nightingale. Early life Murray was born at Newry, the eldest son of John Tulloch, a captain in the British army, and his wife, daughter of Thomas Gregorie of Perth, Scotland. He was educated for the law, but after a brief experience in a legal office in Edinburgh, he. Retrieved 9 April 1826 a commission as ensign in the 45th regiment, which had been serving in Burma in the recently-ended First Anglo-Burmese War. He joined his corps in India, and on 30 November 1827 became lieutenant. In India Tulloch became interested in the question of army reform. He called attention to the food provided for the rank and file, and his corps, then stationed in Burma, were provided with fresh meat, soft bread, and vegetables. He exposed the system used by Indian officials who paid soldier in silver depreciated in value, to the amount of nearly 20%. In addition, the canteen arrangements of the East India Company were such that a private soldier had to pay five times the value of his liquor. Tulloch, while still a subaltern, wrote repeated letters in Indian journals, signed \\"Dugald Dalgetty\\", in which he exposed abuses. He left for Europe on sick leave in 1831. He took home specimens of depreciated coin, had them assayed at the Royal Mint, and got the matter taken up by the secretary at war, John Cam Hobhouse, Baron Broughton, who called on the company for an explanation. The matter was dropped for a time, but about 1836 it was revived by Tulloch, and Earl Grey, after investigation, compelled the company to make reparation by supplying the army yearly with coffee, tea, sugar, and rice, to the value of ¬£70,000, the amount of the annual deficit. On his return to England Tulloch entered the senior department of the Royal Military College Sandhurst, and obtained a first-class certificate. While at the college he gained the friendship of John Narrien the mathematical professor. Statistician During his residence in India Tulloch had been impressed by the amount of sickness among the troops. With figures available to him, he drew up a series of tables showing the approximate death rate at various stations for a period of twenty years. These tables he published in Colburn's United Service Magazine for 1835. They attracted the attention of Earl Grey, then secretary of war, and he appointed Tulloch, with Henry Marshall and George Balfour, to investigate the subject fully and to report on it to parliament. Four volumes of statistical reports were the results of their inquiry, which extended till 1840, and the data afforded by the investigation have formed the basis of many subsequent ameliorations of the soldier's condition. While engaged on the statistics relating to sickness, Tulloch's attention was drawn to the longevity of army pensioners, and after some research he found that great frauds were perpetrated on the government by the relatives of deceased pensioners continuing to draw their pay. By his recommendation these impositions were rendered impossible by the organisation of the pensioners into a corps with staff officers, and in this manner the pensioners were also rendered a body capable of affording assistance to the state on emergency. He obtained a captaincy on 12 March 1838 and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1838 Coronation Honours. He was promoted to the rank of major on 29 March 1839, was appointed lieutenant- colonel on 31 May 1844, and on 20 June 1854 obtained the rank of colonel. Crimean War report In 1855, in consequence of the disasters in the Crimean War, Tulloch was sent with Sir John McNeill to examine the system of commissariat. Their final report was prepared in January 1856, and laid before parliament. Its views reflected on the capacity of many officers of high rank who had served in the Crimea. The commissioners did not lay the entire blame on the failure of the home authorities to furnish adequate supplies, but, on the contrary, reprehended the carelessness of general officers with the army in not providing for the proper distribution of stores and in neglecting the welfare of their troops. The report was resented by many military men, and, through their representations, was referred to a board of general officers assembled at Chelsea. McNeill declined to take any share in the proceedings. Tulloch, however, appeared before the board to sustain the report and to clear himself of charges of malignant feeling made by Lord Lucan. The board refused to endorse the findings of the report, and laid the whole blame of the Crimean disasters on the authorities at Whitehall. Tulloch had been prevented by illness from attending the final meetings, but in 1857 he published, in defence, The Crimean Commission and the Chelsea Board. Palmerston's government then were compelled by a parliamentary vote to bestow on him the honour of K.C.B., and to appoint McNeill a privy councillor. Kinglake, in his Invasion of the Crimea, repeated the allegations of the general officers, and accused the Crimean commissioners of having gone beyond their instructions, and of basing their report on improperly digested evidence. He drew from Tulloch a second edition of his work, published in 1882, on account of \\"certain misstatements in Mr. Kinglake's seventh volume\\", with a preface by Sir John McNeill, in which he denied Kinglake's insinuation that he did not fully support Tulloch in regard to the findings of their report. Family On 17 April 1844, Tulloch married Emma Louisa, youngest daughter of Sir William Hyde Pearson, M.D. Last years In 1859, in poor health, Tulloch retired from the war office with the rank of major-general. He died without issue at Winchester on 16 May 1864, and was buried at Welton, near Daventry. Louisa Tulloch is also buried at Welton, and there is a memorial to her at the church of St. Marten, Welton.

The Institute organizes the largest and most prestigious annual art exhibition in Scotland - open to all artists. The RGI also owns and runs the Kelly Gallery. Situated on Douglas Street in Glasgow City Centre, the Kelly Gallery hosts a running programme of exhibitions and events. The award of RGI is made to artists for artistic merit and their dedication to the Institute. There is a corpus of fifty such awards. Any vacancy is filled through persons being proposed, demonstrating work, and being elected at a specially convened meeting of RGIs. Early days Frances MacDonald: Poster for the Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts (1895) By the middle of the 19th century, Glasgow had become the most important center for trade and industry in Scotland. The city had numerous theatres, concert halls and libraries, but no regular exhibitions for the works of contemporary painters and sculptors. From the 1780s onwards, various organizations had unsuccessfully tried to fill this gap but failed through lack of finance or direction. In 1861 a group of Glasgow's prominent citizens - including the artists John Graham (later John Graham-Gilbert), John Mossman and C N Woolworth - met to discuss the establishment of an annual Art exhibition of the works of contemporary artists. The Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts was duly founded and the first exhibition took place that very same year at the (hired) Corporation Galleries (later renamed the McLellan Galleries) in Sauchiehall Street. It was an artistic and popular success, attracting nearly 40,000 visitors, though financially it made only a small profit. Subsequent exhibitions achieved similar success: Over 45,000 visited the second exhibition, 53,000 the third and the numbers of visitors increased steadily over the next twenty years. The Institute continued to exhibit at the Corporation galleries until 1879 when it opened its own Gallery in Sauchiehall Street - designed by architect John Burnet who took on his son as junior partner J J Burnet. The governing body (council) of the Institute decided that it should open its reach to encompass not only local artists but also the best in modern painting from the whole of Britain and beyond. Paintings were loaned from local collections and agents sent out to London to acquire new pictures. By the 1880s, some of the most famous English artists of the day were regularly shown at the Institute's annual exhibition.Artists exhibiting in the 1880s at the Institute included Albert Joseph Moore, John Everett Millais, William Holman Hunt, Edward Poynter, Frederic Leighton, George Frederic Watts and Edward Burne-Jones Notable French and Dutch artists also featured, either on loan or contributed for sale. By 1880, the Institute had become an influential and well-established venue on the British art exhibition circuit. It helped to inspire the group of painters known as the Glasgow boys who in turn helped steer the Institute towards more avant-garde painting. From this period up until the outbreak of World War I, in Britain the Institute was second only to the Royal Academy in the diversity of work on show. In 1896 it received a royal statute and could now call itself the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts. However, the financial cost of running its own gallery proved to be too much of a burden and the Institute was forced to sell its premises and revert to hiring exhibition space from the Corporation again at the McLellan Galleries.The Institute's old gallery in Sauciehall street was sold to department store Pettigrew and Stephens. After a fire the premises were demolished in the early 1970s. World War I to the present day The Institute's exhibition program continued despite the outbreak of war in 1914. It continued to attract painters from the south: both the older established \\"Glasgow boys\\" such as Sir John Lavery (RA), George Henry (RA), David Gauld, Stuart Park, James Guthrie, Edward Arthur Walton, Edward Atkinson Hornel etc., but also younger artist such as Samuel Peploe, Leslie Hunter and Francis Cadell who had connections with the art of pre-war Paris and the paintings of Matisse and Picasso. After the war, French art was rarely seen in the Institute's exhibitions and avant-garde work from the South was not so much in evidence. Now seen as part of the art establishment, the Institute (like other established art bodies) found it harder to attract work by younger artists, and adopted a more conservative stance which lasted until the 1950s. Since the 1950s a considerable effort has been expended to rekindle the original spirit of the Institute. A new gallery, The Kelly Gallery, was opened in 1965 offering exhibitions throughout the year, lectures and demonstrations. The Institute continues to show and promote a wide range of contemporary art from the west of Scotland and beyond.

Based in Edinburgh, it had established a network of 137 branches at the end of its first hundred years. In 1918 the bank was bought by Lloyds Bank, although it continued to operate as an independent institution until 1959, when it merged with the Commercial Bank of Scotland to become the National Commercial Bank of Scotland. Ten years later the National Commercial Bank merged with the Royal Bank of Scotland. The First Hundred Years In December 1824, The National Bank of Scotland announced that funds had been raised for the formation of a new bank in Edinburgh. Almost immediately it was followed by advertisements from the Scottish Union Banking Company and the Scottish Union Commercial Banking Company stating that they were to follow suit. Negotiations followed whereby the promoters of the latter two banks agreed to join in with the promoters of the National Bank. In March 1825 the National Bank was formally constituted with a nominal capital of ¬£5 million under the chairmanship of the Lord Provost, Alexander Henderson of Press. The Bank finally opened for business in the October and immediately began to issue its own notes. It obtained a Royal Charter in 1831.The National Bank of Scotland 1825-1925 (1925) The \\"National\\" in the Bank‚Äôs title was no accident. \\"From its inception the policy of the Bank was directed towards the establishment of a branch system throughout Scotland.\\" By the end of its first full year there were 13 branches; 40 by 1850 and 112 by the end of the century. It was also the first Scottish bank to open an office in London (1864). From 1885 to 1914 it was second only in size to the Bank of Scotland.S G Checkland, Scottish Banking a History 1695-1973 (1975) Although most of the increase in branches came from new openings, there were some small acquisitions including the Commercial Banking Company of Aberdeen in 1833; and the Perth Union Bank in 1836. It was the National‚Äôs failure to buy the Glasgow & Ship Bank in 1843 that prompted the opening of the first branch in Glasgow. A Bank of Glasgow company was also formed in 1843 and was acquired by the National in 1844 but the evidence from Checkland was that no physical presence had been established and it was no more than a paper transaction prior to a pooling of resources. The banking industry was (and still appears to be) continually afflicted by crises but there is no indication in the histories of anything other than stable financial progress. A table published in 1898 saw annual published net profits between 1864 and 1896 remaining within the range of ¬£100-200,000; the opening year was ¬£125,000 and the closing year ¬£198,000.A W Kerr, Scottish Banking 1865-96 (1898) Part of Lloyds In the early twentieth century the English banks were beginning to look north of the border and in 1918 Lloyds Bank acquired the National Bank. Lloyds allowed the National to continue operating independently until 1959. At that point the Commercial Bank of Scotland approached Lloyds with a view to a merger. Lloyds agreed to dispose of its 100% holding in the National Bank and the two Scottish banks merged to become the National Commercial Bank of Scotland; Lloyds was left with a 37% stake in the enlarged bank. The National Bank became the first commercial bank in the world to offer a mobile banking service, which was established on the Isle of Lewis in 1946. In 1947 a new headquarters building was opened in St. Andrew Square, designed in an American-inspired style.

Education Gentry was born on January 6, 1945 in Clay Center, Kansas, and received his schooling at the Clay Center Community High School, from which he graduated in 1963. He graduated from Kansas State University in 1967 with a B.A. in physical science and a B.S. in botany and zoology. He earned his master's degree in 1969 at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison as a student of botanist Hugh Iltis, with a thesis on the genus Tabebuia (Bignoniaceae) of Central America, a subject which he continued to study at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, from which he received his doctorate in 1972, with a Ph.D. thesis entitled An Eco-evolutionary Study of the Bignoniaceae of South Central America. Career Gentry spent his entire working career at the Missouri Botanical Garden, starting as an assistant curator in October 1972. In 1974, he made his first visit to Peru, a country that became the major focus of much of his subsequent work; he made his second trip there in 1976 and by the time of his death had visited the country 33 times. He also maintained his interest in the Bignoniaceae: he contributed treatments of the family to nine volumes, including the Flora of Panama, and had a further five in press when he died. One of Gentry's major innovations was the use of transect samples as a tool for assessing the composition and structure of tropical forests, known as the Gentry Forest Transect. His method, allied to his encyclopedic knowledge of tropical plants, allowed him to sample a site in a matter of days, and over the course of his career he amassed data from over 200 such transects worldwide. Because many of the plants which he encountered during his transect sampling were not flowering, Gentry developed the ability to identify species from vegetative specimens, not just from flowers and fruits, an ability that led to the publication of his Field Guide to the Families and Genera of Woody Plants of Northwest South America, completed just months before his death. In 1990, Conservation International established a \\"Rapid Assessment Program\\" (RAP) to undertake quick assessments of areas deemed to be significant for conservation. Gentry's transect method was well suited to such work and he became increasingly involved as a member of the RAP team. Death On August 3, 1993, Gentry was on a Rapid Assessment Program mission in western Ecuador, when the light aircraft in which he was traveling crashed into a mountain ridge near Guayaquil. Four people--the pilot, Gentry, American ornithologist Theodore A. Parker III, and Ecuadorian ecologist Eduardo Aspiazu--died in the crash; three other researchers including biologist Alfredo Luna Narv√°ez survived. Legacy Gentry was prolific both as an author and as a plant collector: he published over 200 works and had many more on hand at the time of his death and he collected over 80,000 plant specimens, hundreds of which have proved to be species new to science. Gentry and Parker are memorialized in the annual Parker/Gentry Award for Conservation Biology of the Field Museum of Natural History. Several plant species have been named after Gentry, including: Acidocroton gentryi, Citharexylum gentryi, Crossothamnus gentryi, Eleutherodactylus gentryi, Hedyosmum gentryi, Metalepis gentryi, Palicourea gentryi, Phyllanthus gentryi, Sobralia gentryi and Zamia gentryi, as well as a bird, Herpsilochmus gentryi. In several instances, Gentry had been involved in the collection of the type specimens of these plants.

Rich Internet applications are globally popular, but most are not easy to learn, and generate pages that are not amenable to search engine optimization; FHTML was created to deal with these issues. FHTML can be used with server-side web technologies such as Java, .NET Framework and PHP, and includes a layout engine that is more flexible than CSS. FHTML is compatible in all major web browsers, and allows web developers to create rich web functionality using easy HTML-like code. Development of the language went through private beta testing, and was planned to be opened for beta testing sometime in 2010. Advantages FHTML has the ease of use and search engine optimization of HTML, and does not need to be compiled like Flex, Silverlight, and Flash. Websites and schools can use the technology for free without support. FHTML runs on 95% of current browsers with no additional plug-ins or download required. It supports 3D computer animation natively, and reduces total cost of ownership for a business. .NET, Python, Java, PHP, and Ruby developers can all write FHTML in their original language.

Let \\\\displaystyle S be a non- negative increasing function on the half-line [0,+\\\\infty) such that \\\\displaystyle S(0)=0.

The Khabibullin's conjecture is valid for \\\\lambda\\\\leq 1 without the assumption of convexity of S(e^x). Meanwhile, one can show that this conjecture is not valid without some convexity conditions for S. In 2010, R. A. Sharipov showed that the conjecture fails in the case n=2 and for \\\\lambda=2.

The organization's curricula seek to address all aspects of the girls' development in order to enhance their physical, emotional, mental, social, and spiritual well-being while establishing a lifetime appreciation towards health and fitness. Local chapters (called \\"councils\\") operate under an umbrella organization, Girls on the Run International, which develops curricula and provides support to said councils. Girls on the Run International also encourages the formation of additional councils in areas not yet served by the program.

Accessed 2013.06.25. Meeting bi-weekly in teams of 8-20 girls, the program teaches life skills through fun, engaging lessons that celebrate the joy of movement. The 24-lesson curriculum is taught by certified coaches and includes three parts: understanding ourselves, valuing relationships and teamwork, and understanding how we connect with and shape the world at large. Over the course of the program, participants develop and improve competence, feel confidence in who they are, develop strength of character, respond to others and themselves with care and compassion, create positive connections with peers and adults, and make a meaningful contribution to community and society.Girls on the Run International, \\"What We Do\\". Girls on the Run Over a period of ten to twelve weeks, girls in third through fifth grade participate in an after-school program designed to allow every girl to recognize her inner strength. The Girls on the Run curriculum inspires girls to define their lives on their own terms. Throughout the season, the girls make new friends, build their confidence, and celebrate all that makes them unique.3rd-5th Grade Program, Girls on the Run; accessed 2014.03.18. The Girls on the Run lessons encourage positive emotional, social, mental, and physical development. The Girls on the Run program uses the tenants of sports-based youth development to determine program activities, curricula, staff training, and guiding principles. Participants explore and discuss their own beliefs around experiences and challenges girls face at this age. They also develop strategies and skills to help them navigate life experiences. The program starts with helping girls get a better understanding of who they are and what is important to them. Then, participants look at the importance of teamwork and healthy relationships. Finally, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world. Physical activity is woven into the program to inspire an appreciation of fitness and in order to build habits that lead to a lifetime of health. At the end of each three-month session, the girls participate in a Girls on the Run 5k event, which involves other Girls on the Run teams from the community and possibly other councils. This celebratory, non-competitive event is the culminating experience of the curriculum. Coaches, parents, and community members participate, cheer, and celebrate. Heart & Sole Middle-school girls face many challenges that can affect their emotional and physical well-being, and which are different from those faced by younger girls. The Heart & Sole curriculum is designed to address these challenges by empowering participants to make thoughtful and healthy decisions. Like Girls on the Run, the Heart & Sole curriculum is delivered over the course of 10 to 12 weeks and addresses the societal, mental, and emotional challenges peculiar to that age.6th-8th Grade Program, Girls on the Run; accessed 2014.03.18. Like the curriculum for younger girls, Heart & Sole begins by encouraging the participants to examine and better understand who they are and what is important to them. Once they have a deeper awareness of their individual values, they look at the role of teams and healthy relationships. Lastly, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world. The curriculum allows for more mature handling of such topics as eating disorders, internet safety, relationships, cyber-bullying and tobacco and alcohol use. Participants discuss these subjects on an in-depth level and use their personal experiences to shape thought-provoking interaction. The Heart & Sole curriculum is designed to provide each girl with \\"the skills to shut out the noise of the external world that is attempting to limit who she is and to instead listen to her individual truth ‚Äì the one that will lead her toward an enriching and contented life.\\" As may be expected, running is a significant part of the curriculum. Heart & Sole uses physical activity to inspire and motivate girls throughout the program. This physical activity is designed to encourage a lifelong appreciation for health and fitness, as well as to build confidence through a sense of accomplishment. At the end of each season (fall and spring),girls and their running buddies complete in the semiannual 5k running event, which gives the girls a tangible sense of achievement, as well as a framework for setting and achieving life goals.

Ten years later it merged with the Royal Bank of Scotland, to become the largest clearing bank in Scotland. The National Commercial Bank issued its own banknotes. At its foundation, the National Commercial Bank of Scotland had assets of around ¬£300 million, and had 476 branches in Scotland and England. A joint venture with asset management company Schroders in 1964 saw the launch of a Scottish merchant banking service. The bank acquired the 36 English and Welsh branches of The National Bank Ltd., when the Irish operations of that institution were bought by the Bank of Ireland in 1966. The National Commercial Bank also established a \\"ladies branch\\" for female customers, staffed entirely by women. By 1969 economic conditions were becoming more difficult for the banking sector. In response, the National Commercial Bank merged with the Royal Bank of Scotland. The resulting company had 662 branches. The merger resulted in a new holding company, National & Commercial Banking Group Ltd. The English and Welsh branches were reorganised as Williams & Glyn's Bank, while the Scottish branches transferred to the Royal Bank name.

It acts as a œÉ1 receptor agonist and NMDA receptor antagonist. It has no significant affinity for the œÉ2, Œº-opioid, or Œ¥-opioid receptor, or for the serotonin or norepinephrine transporter. As an NMDA receptor antagonist, in vivo, it is approximately twice as potent as dextromethorphan, and five-fold less potent than dextrorphan. Uses in Scientific Research= Masking of sigma-1 receptor  Dextrallorphan is often used in research to block œÉ1 receptor sites so that œÉ2 receptor sites (which have not been cloned yet ) can be studied. It was hypothesized that both of these sigma (œÉ) receptors were opioid receptors, due to their affinity for psychoactive drugs. However, it is now understood that they are non-opioid receptors that bind to certain psychoactive drugs, like dextrallorphan. One example of dextrallorphan being used to mask œÉ1 receptor sites was seen in a study on the localization of the œÉ2 receptor in detergent-resistant lipid raft domains. It has also been used to mask œÉ1 receptor sites so that œÉ2 receptor binding characteristics in the rat liver could be determined, by labeling œÉ2 receptor sites with [3H]l,3-di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG) in the presence of 1 ŒºM dextrallorphan solution. Animal Studies Dextrallorphan was used in Spraque-Dawley rats to study cerebellar Purkinje neurons electrophysical responses to the drug when it was applied iontophoretically as a sigma (œÉ) receptor ligand. Dextrallorphan increased the firing rate by 14%, suggesting that sigma (œÉ) ligands (like dextrallorphan) alter the spontaneous firing of Purkinje neurons and cause motor effects. In another study, dextrallorphan, along with other opioid derivatives, was found to be a potent inhibitor of etorphine-inaccessible (EI) sites in the guinea-pig brain. Dextrallorphan was of the top three most potent opioid inhibitors of those studied, with a concentration of 67 nM required to show 50% inhibition. History In 1955, dextrallorphan has been used to study inhibition of cholinesterase's and to look at the relationship between analgetics and acetylcholine metabolism. It was found that dextrallorphan inhibits 25% of bovine erythrocyte cholinesterase at a dose of 10‚àí3 mole/liter, which corresponds to a concentration of up to 0.2 mg/kg in dog intestine. However, at this dose the drug showed no effect on the gut tone. Dextrallorphan was classified as a potent inhibitor of the intestinal and red blood cell cholinesterase based on the concentration of the drug needed to inhibit these enzymes in the cholinesterase preparations from the animals systems utilized. Simultaneously, dextrallorphan showed no analgesia and no change in intestinal tone. With these results dextrallorphan helped proved that there is no correlation between the inhibition of cholinesterase systems and analgetic or intestinal effects. In 1979, dextrallorphan was found to have a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for binding to the pituitary and brain receptor of 10,000 ¬± 1000 nM and 10,000 ¬± 1500 nM, respectively. While its stereoisomer, levallorphan, had a 10,000 times more potent dose, thus proving that binding to these receptors is stereospecific.

Writers may revise their writing after a draft is complete or during the composing process. Revision is closely related to editing. Many writers go through multiple rounds of revisions before they reach a final draft: \\"Few writers are so expert that they can produce what they are after on the first try. Quite often you will discover, on examining the completed work, that there are serious flaws in the arrangement of the material, calling for transpositions... do not be afraid to experiment with your text.\\" In an essay, revision may involve the identification of a thesis, a reconsideration of structure or organization, working at uncovering weaknesses, or clarifying unclear positions. In general, revision of written work can be guided by questions such as: * Is the writing clear? Does it make sense? * Is there enough information to describe ideas? * Is there too much information so that the writing wanders off topic? * Are the ideas or the narrative flow in a logical order? Revision is not about improving grammar or diction, which are \\"editing\\". However, writer or the author may employ a strategy for both. There are theories such as the three-component model by Hayes and Flower and the James Britton's model of the writing process as a series of stages described in metaphors of linear growth, conception - incubation - production.

After Tommy lets her know that he cared for her out of his love for her; not for pity, Grizel is happy.  Cast  Reception  The film received mixed reviews when it was released on May 29, 1921. The Minneapolis Morning Tribune expressed admiration for the film's acting. Calling out the director Barrie for directing this \\"very fine film\\" and how the film expressed so much emotion. The article also stated that Hughes, the very famous Welsh actor, is a big hit with the fans. According to The Philadelphia Inquirer, \\"there is the tender, elusive quality, the charm and the pathos, the humor, the quality which could bring one to tears while smiling.\\" The reviewer called the depiction of Tommy growing from a child to a man as \\"simply spectacular\\". Variety stated that the film must have been \\"a great pleasure\\" to record a movie that is so fine and expresses admiration for how a book has been translated so finely to the screen. The author of the article talks about the character Tommy in his entirety of how he is a \\"profound character in this film particular.\\" Going into depth about how the movie was incredibly directed and spews about the actor who played Tommy, Gareth Hughes. People were infatuated with Hughes and liked his acting style in the movie for it portrayed the Tommy people knew and loved in the novel. The Christian Science Monitor stated the film \\"respects its original novel that was printed years prior to the movie.\\" The author of the article states how Tommy's story is told with \\"numerous titles but, happily, they are written by someone with an active intelligence.\\" The reviewer likened the film to The Four Horsemen, The Ole Swimming Hole, and Thrums of Long Island. Sherwood, from Life Magazine gives a review of Sentimental Tommy with the pros and cons he lists. mentioning the director of the film whom is, John S. Robertson and states that throughout the film Robertson displays a \\"commendable degree of good taste throughout.\\" This \\"perfect interpretation\\" of the novel leads him on to say how he was surprised how good the film turned out considering how unusual the settings in the novel were. The one thing that did bother Sherwood was the film was \\"far too long.\\" Negative reviews included one that ran in The Minneapolis Morning Tribune, the headline stated: \\"Reviewer calls happy ending only real weakness of screen version.\\" Life ran an article expressing dissatisfaction with the top ten movies of 1921, Sentimental Tommy among them, explaining how an unwritten law has landed these \\"trendy movies\\" into the top.

Forms of victimization include (but are not limited to) bullying or peer victimization, physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal abuse, robbery, and assault. Some of these forms of victimization are commonly associated with certain populations, but they can happen to others as well. For example, bullying or peer victimization is most commonly studied in children and adolescents but also takes place between adults. Although anyone may be victimized, particular groups (e.g. children, the elderly, individuals with disabilities) may be more susceptible to certain types of victimization and as a result to the symptoms and consequences that follow. Individuals respond to victimization in a wide variety of ways, so noticeable symptoms of victimization will vary from person to person. These symptoms may take on several different forms (e.g. psychological, behavioral, or physical), be associated with specific forms of victimization, and be moderated by individual characteristics of the victim and/or experiences after victimization. Categories of outcomes Symptoms of victimization may include negative physical, psychological, or behavioral consequences that are direct or indirect responses (see physical symptoms section) to victimization experiences. Symptoms in these categories sometimes overlap, are closely related, or cause each other. For example, a behavioral symptom such as an increase in aggressiveness or irritability may be part of a particular psychological outcome such as posttraumatic stress disorder. Much of the research on symptoms of victimization is cross-sectional (researchers only collected data at one point in time). From a research perspective this means that the symptoms are associated with victimization, but the causal relationship is not always established and alternative explanations have not been ruled out. Some of the symptoms described also may put individuals at risk for victimization. For example, there may be a two-way relationship between victimization and certain internalizing symptoms such as depression or withdrawal, such that victimization increases these symptoms, and individuals exhibiting these symptoms may be targeted for victimization more often than others. Psychological The experience of being victimized may cause an individual to feel vulnerable or helpless, as well as changing their view of the world and/or their self-perception; the psychological distress this causes may manifest in a number of ways. Diagnosable psychological disorders that are associated with victimization experiences include depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Psychological symptoms that are disruptive to a person's life may be present in some form even if they do not meet diagnostic criteria for a specific disorder. A variety of symptoms such as withdrawal, avoidance, and nightmares, may be part of one of these diagnosable disorders or may occur in milder or more isolated form; diagnoses of particular disorders require that these symptoms have a particular degree of severity or frequency, or that an individual exhibits a certain number of them in order to be formally diagnosed. =Depression= Depression has been found to be associated with many forms of victimization, including sexual victimization, violent crime, property crime, peer victimization, and domestic abuse. Indicators of depression include irritable or sad mood for prolonged periods of time, lack of interest in most activities, significant changes in weight/appetite, activity, and sleep patterns, loss of energy and concentration, excessive feelings of guilt or worthlessness, and suicidality. The loss of energy, interest, and concentration associated with depression may impact individuals who have experienced victimization academically or professionally. Depression can impact many other areas of a person's life as well, including interpersonal relationships and physical health. Depression in response to victimization may be lethal, as it can result in suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Examples of this include a ten-fold increase found in suicide attempts among rape victims compared to the general population, and significant correlations between being victimized in school and suicidal ideation. =Anxiety= A connection between victimization and anxiety has been established for both children and adults. The particular types of anxiety studied in relation to victimization vary; some research references anxiety as a general term while other research references more specific types such as social anxiety. The term anxiety covers a range of difficulties and several specific diagnoses, including panic attacks, phobias, and generalized anxiety disorder. Panic attacks are relatively short, intense bursts of fear that may or may not have a trigger (a cause in the immediate environment that happens right before they occur). They are sometimes a part of other anxiety disorders. Phobias may be specific to objects, situations, people, or places. They can result in avoidance behaviors or, if avoidance is not possible, extreme anxiety or panic attacks. Generalized anxiety is characterized by long-term, uncontrolled, intense worrying in addition to other symptoms such as irritability, sleep problems, or restlessness. Anxiety has been shown to disrupt many aspects of people's lives as well, e.g. academic functioning, and to predict worse health outcomes later in life. =Posttraumatic stress disorder= Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a specific anxiety disorder in response to a traumatic event in a person's life. It is often discussed in the context of mental health of combat veterans, but also occurs in individuals who have been traumatized in other ways, such as victimization. PTSD involves long-term intense fear, re-experiencing the traumatic event (e.g. nightmares), avoidance of reminders of the event, and being highly reactive (e.g. easily enraged or startled). It may include feeling detached from other people, self-guilt, and difficulty sleeping. Individuals with PTSD may experience a number of symptoms similar to those experienced in both anxiety and depression. In addition to the established diagnostic criteria for PTSD, Frank Ochberg proposed a specific set of victimization symptoms (not formally recognized in diagnostic systems such as the DSM or ICD) that includes shame, self-blame, obsessive hatred of the person who victimized them alongside conflicting positive feelings toward that person, feeling defiled, being sexually inhibited, despair or resignation to the situation, secondary victimization (described below), and risk of revictimization. Other Additional symptoms of victimization may take on physical or behavioral forms. These may be direct, individual symptoms of victimization, or they may result from the psychological outcomes described above. =Physical= The most direct and obvious physical symptoms of victimization are injuries as a result of an aggressive physical action such as assault or sexual victimization. Other physical symptoms that are not a result of injury may be indirectly caused by victimization through psychological or emotional responses. Physical symptoms with a psychological or emotional basis are called psychosomatic symptoms. Common psychosomatic symptoms associated with victimization include headaches, stomachaches and experiencing a higher frequency of illnesses such as colds and sore throats. Though psychosomatic symptoms are referred to as having psychological causes they have a biological basis as well; stress and other psychological symptoms trigger nervous system responses such as the release of various chemicals and hormones which then affect biological functioning. =Behavioral= Individuals who have been victimized may also exhibit behavioral symptoms after the experience. Some individuals who have been victimized show externalizing (outwardly directed) behaviors. For example, an individual who has not previously acted aggressively toward others may begin to do so as after being victimized, such as when a child who has been bullied begins to bully others. Aggressive behaviors may be associated with PTSD (described above). Externalizing behaviors associated with victimization include hyperactivity, hypervigilance, and attention problems that may resemble ADHD. Others may exhibit internalizing (inwardly directed) behavioral symptoms. Many internalizing symptoms tend to be more psychological in nature (depression and anxiety are sometimes referred to as internalization), but particular behaviors are indicative of internalization as well. Internalizing behaviors that have been documented in victimized individuals include withdrawing from social contact and avoidance of people or situations. =Substance use= Drug and alcohol use associated with victimization is sometimes explained as a form of self-medication, or an attempt to alleviate other symptoms resulting from victimization through substance use. Supporting this, alcohol use has been empirically connected to particular symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. Sexual abuse in particular has been identified as one significant precursor to serious alcohol use among women, although it is not as well-established as a causal link and may be mediated by PTSD or other psychological symptoms. Connections have been established between victimization and the use of other drugs as well. Drug use in adolescence and peer victimization based on sexual orientation are correlated. Research has drawn connections between substance use and childhood physical abuse in the general population. Drug use has also been connected to both physical and sexual victimization among high risk, incarcerated youth. Types Specific types of victimization have been strongly linked to particular symptoms or outcomes. These symptoms are not exclusively associated with these forms of victimization but have been studied in association with them, possibly because of their relevance to the specific victimization experiences. Sexual Some individuals who have experienced victimization may have difficulty establishing and maintaining intimate relationships. This is not a subset of symptoms that is exclusive to sexual victimization, but the link between sexual victimization and intimacy problems has been particularly well-established in research. These difficulties may include sexual dysfunction, anxiety about sexual relationships, and dating aggression. Those who experience sexual victimization may have these difficulties long-term, as in the case of victimized children who continue to have difficulty with intimacy during adolescence and adulthood. Some research suggests that the severity of these intimacy problems is related directly to the severity of victimization, while other research suggests that self-blame and shame about sexual victimization mediates (causes) the relationship between victimization and outcomes. Childhood bullying One symptom that has been associated particularly with school-based peer victimization is poor academic functioning. This symptom is not exclusive to peer victimization, but is contextually relevant due to the setting in which such victimization takes place. Studies have shown poor academic functioning to be a result of peer victimization in elementary, middle, and high school in multiple countries. Though academic functioning has commonly been studied in relation to childhood bullying that takes place in schools, it is likely associated with other forms of victimization as well, as both depression and anxiety affect attention and focus. Childhood physical abuse Researchers have drawn connections between childhood physical abuse and tendencies toward violent or aggressive behaviors both during childhood and later in life. This aligns logically with increases in aggression and reactivity described above (see psychological symptoms section). The increased risk for engaging in aggressive behavior may be an indirect symptom, mediated by changes in the way that individuals process social information. Increased risk does not mean that everyone who was physically victimized during childhood will continue the cycle of violence with their own children or engage in aggressive behaviors to a point that it is highly detrimental or requires legal action; estimated numbers of individuals who do continue this pattern vary based on the type of aggressive behavior being studied. For example, 16-21% of abused and/or neglected children in one particular study were arrested for violent offenses by around the age of 30. Moderating factors In psychology, a moderator is a factor that changes the outcome of a particular situation. With regards to victimization, these can take the form of environmental or contextual characteristics, other people‚Äôs responses after victimization has occurred, or a victimized person‚Äôs internal responses to or views on what they have experienced. Attributions Attributions about a situation or person refer to where an individual places the blame for an event. An individual may have a different response to being victimized and exhibit different symptoms if they interpret the victimization as being their own fault, the fault of the perpetrator of the victimization, or the fault of some other external factor. Attributions also vary by how stable or controllable someone believes a situation to be. Characterological self-blame for victimization (believing that something is one's own fault, that it is a stable characteristic about themselves, and that it is unchangeable or out of their control) has been shown to make victims feel particularly helpless and to have a negative effect on psychological outcomes. While self-blaming attributions have potentially harmful moderating effects on the symptoms of victimization for those who are already prone to self-blame, it is worth noting that self-blame may itself be a result of victimization for some individuals as noted above (see section on PTSD). Coping and help-seeking Victimized individuals who participate in active forms of coping experience fewer or less severe psychological symptoms after victimization. One form of active coping is seeking help from others. Help-seeking can be informal (e.g. seeking help from friends or family) or formal (e.g. police reporting of victimization). Attributions about victimization may play a role in whether an individual seeks help or from whom they seek it. For example, a recent study showed that children who are being victimized by peers are less likely to seek support from friends or teachers if they attribute victimization to a group factor such as race, and more likely to seek support if they attribute victimization to more individualized personal characteristics. Similarly, adult victims who blame themselves and are ashamed of being victimized may wish to hide the experience from others, and thus be less willing to seek help. Gender may affect willingness seek help as well; men who have been victimized may be less willing to disclose this information and ask for help due to differing societal expectations for men in addition to the shame and stigmatization experienced by both men and women in response to victimization. The increased social support that sometimes results from seeking help may alleviate some of the symptoms of victimization and decrease the risk of continued or future victimization. However, seeking help may also make the outcomes and symptoms worse, depending on the context and responses to help-seeking behavior. Help-seeking may be received more positively from some individuals than others; for example, elementary school aged girls who seek social support after victimization may benefit from it socially, while victimized boys of the same age may experience worse social problems as a result of the same support-seeking behaviors. Seeking help may also increase the severity of victimization symptoms if an individual experiences secondary victimization in the form of victim-blaming, being forced to mentally relive a victimization experience, or other negative responses from individuals or institutions from whom they seek help. Secondary victimization has been documented in victims of rape when they seek medical or psychological assistance. It has also been documented in individuals whose victimization results in criminal trials, particularly if the outcomes of those trials were not in the victims' favor.

At the time, South Korea was the third-largest purchaser of U.S. beef exports, with an estimated market value of $815 million.

People's Daily Import ban The Government of South Korea banned imports of U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease was discovered in a cow in Washington. By 2006, the United States Department of Agriculture would confirm a total of three cases of BSE-infected cattle, two raised domestically, and one imported from Canada. At the time, South Korea was the third-largest purchaser of US beef exports, with an estimated market value of $815 million. An early attempt to reopen the Korean market in the fall of 2006 failed when the Korean government discovered bone chips in the shipment.Korea discovers bone chips in U.S. beef Sporadic attempts made in the following year also failed for similar reasons.Korea suspends quarantine inspection of all U.S. beefKorea halts inspection of U.S. beef imports after bone discovery Protests Throughout the ban, domestic beef farmers and local activists opposed re-opening of the market to U.S. claiming that American beef would cause mad cow disease.Beef farmers full of worry over future When the Lotte Department Store attempted to sell US beef in July 2007 during the Roh Moo- hyun administration, local activists stormed the meat counters and hurled cow dung at department store workers, abruptly terminating the resumption of sales.Beef sales bring out a storm of protests When President Lee Myung-bak assumed office in February 2008, it was widely expected that he would relax the ban on US beef as part of the process of ratification for the South Korea ‚Äì United States Free Trade Agreement concluded by his predecessor, Roh Moo- hyun. Lee Myung-bak's attempt to reopen the Korean market to US beef along with protests against the Free Trade Agreement led to the country's largest anti-government protests in 20 years. Lifting of import ban Despite the protests, US beef imports resumed on 1 July 2008. On 2 July 2008, Han Seung- soo, Prime Minister of South Korea bought 260,000 won worth of U.S. steak to eat with his family at his official residence to alleviate public worries about US beef. Imports of U.S. beef grew throughout 2008. During that year, Australian beef accounted for 60% (12,753 tons) of a total 21,184 tons of imported beef, but U.S. beef became the second largest supplier of foreign beef with 20% (4,439 tons). With continued import growth since the lifting of the ban, in 2010, South Korea surpassed US beef imports in Japan for the first time to become the largest market for U.S. beef in Asia. In 2012 South Korea ramped up inspections of U.S. beef imports following the U.S. government's confirmation of a fourth case of BSE but did not halt imports. South Korea ended the special inspections two months later.

Its history can be reviewed in three distinct eras; between 1932-1951 (1st era), 1963-1980 (2nd era) and after 1987 (3rd era). http://www.halkevleri.org.tr/hakkimizda Halkevleri in Mayday 2012  Background  The Turkish Republic was proclaimed in 1923 after a series of costly wars involving the Ottoman Empire. The human loss was great, especially among the intellectuals. Also, the most profitable agricultural land had been lost and the country was economically bankrupt. After the republic was proclaimed, measures were taken to raise the low literacy rate and to improve the economy. However, the great depression was another blow to the new republic. A second problem of the new republic was the reaction of the conservatives against the reforms, especially the secularist practices of the republic. The Halkevleri can be seen as the successors of the Turkish Hearths, a Turkish social institution which was disestablished before the founding of the Halkevleri in 1932.  The scope of the project  Halkevleri was an enlightenment project aimed towards city dwellers to gain support for reforms. It was planned by Kemal Atat√ºrk, the founder of the modern Turkey. On February 17, 1932, branches of Halkevleri were opened in 17 cities. (Adana, Ankara, Bolu, Bursa, √áanakkale, Denizli, Diyarbakƒ±r, Eski≈üehir, ƒ∞stanbul, ƒ∞zmir, Konya, Malatya and Samsun.) But soon, the number increased to 478. Towards 1940, the villages were also included in the project. The sub branches in villages were called Halkodalarƒ± () Towards 1950, the total number of these subsections exceeded 4000.  The activities  The purpose of the project was to enlighten the people and to decrease the influence of the conservative circles. Free courses were offered on the topics of literature, drama, music, fine arts, speaking, and writing as well as handicrafts and tailoring. Folksay and folksongs were surveyed. Halkevleri also had 761 libraries and reading rooms.Halkevleri page Mersin Halkevi building, now used as a cultural center and opera house  1st era (1932‚Äì1951)  Halkevleri operated as a state organization between from 1932 till 1951. During multiparty period (after 1945) Halkevleri were severely criticized on the ground that this project was a supporter of the governing Republican People‚Äôs Party.Altan √ñymen: √ñfkeli Yƒ±llar, Doƒüan Kitap, 2009, , pp 203-220 The opposing Democrat Party won the 1950 elections. On the Aug. 8, 1951 Halkevleri were closed.T√ºrkiye‚Äônin 75 yƒ±lƒ±, Tempo, ƒ∞stanbul, 1998  2nd era (1963‚Äì1980)  In 1963 Halkevleri was opened again, not by the government but by civil community. The second era was totally independent of the government between 1932‚Äì1951. In the second era Halkevleri acted as an umbrella organisation of leftist movements powerful before 1980 Turkish coup d'√©tat. The most ever supported leftist revolutionary movement of Turkey \\"revolutionary path\\" Devrimci Yol was active in most Halkevleri branches. This was one of main reasons for the closing of Halkevleri with the 1980 Turkish coup d'√©tat.http://www.halkevleri.org.tr/hakkimizda  3rd era (1987‚Äì)  Halkevleri flags May Day 2012 Children having free lessons from volunteer teachers in Halkevleri branches during summertime In 1987, Halkevleri was opened again by the civil community.

The former site of a Spanish colonial era Japanese settlement, it prominently features a memorial commemorating Japanese Roman Catholic kirishitan daimy≈ç Dom Justo Takayama, who settled there in 1615. It is one of two open public spaces in Paco, the other being Paco Park. Currently, Plaza Dilao is one of five freedom parks in the City of Manila, where protests and rallies may be held without requiring permission from local authorities. History In Spanish colonial times, Paco (originally Dilao) was home to one of two Japanese settlements in Manila, with the other located in San Miguel. While the Japanese community of Plaza Dilao began with Dom Justo Takayama and his family settling in the surrounding area after they were exiled from Japan in 1615, most Japanese in Manila at the time were settled around the area now occupied by the Philippine Normal University. However, in 1762, the Japanese residents of Manila were later relocated here by the Spanish authorities, although after then the community's population began to decline owing to reduced Japanese immigration to the Philippines and Japan's policy of sakoku. It is believed that the presence of the Japanese community around the plaza eventually led it to being called \\"Plaza Dilao\\", referring to the yellowish (dilaw in Tagalog) skin tone of the area's inhabitants. During the American period, Plaza Dilao became a transport center with the construction of the Paco railway station in 1915, directly across from the plaza. During World War II, the area was the site of an intense battle between Japanese and joint Filipino and American forces led by Cleto Rodriguez. The plaza is still considered a transport center today: when former President Joseph Estrada became Mayor of Manila in 2013, he ordered a ban on city buses entering Manila, with buses for a while terminating at the plaza instead of their usual terminus at the Liwasang Bonifacio. Surrounding buildings and structures Aside from the Paco railway station, two prominent organizations in the Philippines are headquartered in the immediate vicinity of Plaza Dilao. The Philippine Columbian Association (PCA), the Philippines' oldest sporting club, relocated its headquarters to the plaza on April 1, 1979, while the Asociaci√≥n de Damas de Filipinas (Ladies' Association of the Philippines) is located close to the plaza along Quirino Avenue Extension, having been located in the same place since its establishment in 1913.

During its lifetime, the .32 rimfire was loaded with black powder, followed by semi-smokeless and smokeless powder loadings. While it was popular as a very effective small game caliber, it was considered obsolete by the late 1930s, in part due to the introduction of high-velocity versions of the .22 Long Rifle using smokeless powder.

The attack exploits the fact that most regular expression implementations have exponential time worst case complexity: the time taken can grow exponentially in relation to input size. An attacker can thus cause a program to spend an unbounded amount of time processing by providing such a regular expression, either slowing down or becoming unresponsive. Description Regular expression (\\"regex\\") matching can be done by building a finite-state automaton. Regex can be easily converted to nondeterministic automata (NFAs), in which for each state and input symbol there may be several possible next states. After building the automaton, several possibilities exist: * the engine may convert it to a deterministic finite-state automaton (DFA) and run the input through the result; * the engine may try one by one all the possible paths until a match is found or all the paths are tried and fail (\\"backtracking\\"). * the engine may consider all possible paths through the nondeterministic automaton in parallel; * the engine may convert the nondeterministic automaton to a DFA lazily (i.e., on the fly, during the match). Of the above algorithms, the first two are problematic. The first is problematic because a deterministic automaton could have up to 2^m states where m is the number of states in the nondeterministic automaton; thus, the conversion from NFA to DFA may take exponential time. The second is problematic because a nondeterministic automaton could have an exponential number of paths of length n, so that walking through an input of length n will also take exponential time. The last two algorithms, however, do not exhibit pathological behavior. Note that for non-pathological regular expressions the problematic algorithms are usually fast, and in practice one can expect them to \\"compile\\" a regex in O(m) time and match it in O(n) time; instead, simulation of an NFA and lazy computation of the DFA have O(m2n) worst-case complexity.Lazy computation of the DFA can usually reach the speed of deterministic automatons while keeping worst case behavior similar to simulation of an NFA. However, it is considerably more complex to implement and can use more memory. Regex denial of service occurs when these expectations are applied to regex provided by the user, and malicious regular expressions provided by the user trigger the worst-case complexity of the regex matcher. While regex algorithms can be written in an efficient way, most regex engines in existence extend the regex languages with additional constructs that cannot always be solved efficiently. Such extended patterns essentially force the implementation of regex in most programming languages to use backtracking. Examples=Exponential backtracking The most severe type of problem happens with backtracking regular expression matches, where some patterns have a runtime which is exponential in the length of the input string. For strings of n characters, the runtime is O(2^n). This happens when a regular expression has three properties: * the regular expression applies repetition (\`+\`, \`*\`) to a subexpression; * the subexpression can match the same input in multiple ways, or the subexpression can match an input string which is a prefix of a longer possible match; * and after the repeated subexpression, there is an expression that matches something which the subexpression does not match. The second condition is best explained with two examples: * in \`(aa)+$\`, repetition is applied to the subexpression \`aa\`, which can match \`a\` in two ways on each side of the alternation. * in \`(a+)*$\`, repetition is applied the subexpression \`a+\`, which can match \`a\` or \`aa\`, etc. In both of these examples we used \`$\` to match the end of the string, satisfying the third condition, but it is also possible to use another character for this. For example \`(aaa)*c\` has the same problematic structure. All three of the above regular expressions will exhibit exponential runtime when applied to strings of the form a...a!. For example if you try to match them against \`aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\` on a backtracking expression engine, it will take a significantly long time to complete, and the runtime will approximately double for each extra \`a\` before the \`!\`. It is also possible to have backtracking which is polynomial time O(n^x), instead of exponential. This can also cause problems for long enough inputs, though less attention has been paid to this problem as malicious input must be much longer to have a significant effect. An example of such a pattern is \\"\`a*b?a*x\`\\", when the input being an arbitrarily long sequence of \\"\`a\`\\"s. Vulnerable regexes in online repositories So-called \\"evil\\" or malicious regexes have been found in online regular expression repositories. Note that it is enough to find an evil subexpression in order to attack the full regex: # RegExLib, id=1757 (email validation) - see part, which is an Evil Regex \`^([a-zA-Z0-9])(@){1}[a-z0-9]+[.]{1}(([a-z]{2,3})([a-z]{2,3}[.]{1}[a-z]{2,3}))$\` # OWASP Validation Regex Repository, Java Classname - see part, which is an Evil Regex \`^[A-Z]([a-z])+$\` These two examples are also susceptible to the input \`aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\`. Attacks If a regex itself is affected by a user input, the attacker can inject a malicious regex and make the system vulnerable. Therefore, in most cases, regular expression denial of service can be avoided by removing the possibility for the user to execute arbitrary patterns on the server. In this case, web applications and databases are the main vulnerable applications. Alternatively, a malicious page could hang the user's web browser or cause it to use arbitrary amounts of memory. However, some of the examples in the above paragraphs are considerably less \\"artificial\\" than the others; thus, they demonstrate how a vulnerable regexes may be used as a result of programming mistakes. In this case e-mail scanners and intrusion detection systems could also be vulnerable. Fortunately, in most cases the problematic regular expressions can be rewritten as \\"non-evil\\" patterns. For example, \`(.*a)+\` can be rewritten to \`([^a]*a)+\`. In the case of a web application, the programmer may use the same regular expression to validate input on both the client and the server side of the system. An attacker could inspect the client code, looking for evil regular expressions, and send crafted input directly to the web server in order to hang it.

The airfield is located in an isolated low-lying swamp area. History The airfield was built by the Dutch in the late 1920s or 1930s. It was the final stop for KLM airlines in Dutch New Guinea. After the Pacific War with Japan broke out in December 1941, a Royal Australian Air Force engineering party with the assistance of the Dutch upgraded the airstrip for military use. First attacked by Japanese H6K Mavis flying boats on December 30, 1941, leaving 3 dead and 14 wounded, including a number of children. Three RAAF No. 13 Squadron Lockheed Hudson bombers were sent there to act as 'fighters', this temporary duty was regarded to be against enemy flying boats while the Dutch KNIL garrison of approximately 200 rushed to improve area defenses and create a clearing for a second runway. The Japanese 2nd Detachment landed at Babo on April 2, 1942 and occupied the town. Most of the Dutch soldiers escaped to Australia. The airfield was developed into a major base used by both the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy units in the Vogelkop Peninsula, staging to other airfields to the south Aru and Kai Islands or east to New Guinea. The Japanese built a second 'hardtop' runway creating two strips of 4,530' and 2,660' respectively. Naval troops constructed 15 bomber and 24 fighter revetments with more under construction. The base largely escaped any Allied bombing until mid-1943. The aerial units based at Babo opposed the American landings at Biak, but suffered heavy losses. The army's 24th Sentai lost 20 pilots and 40 planes while based at Babo in only 30 days then was withdrawn. The navy's 202nd K≈çk≈´tai was temporarily withdrawn from Babo for defense of Truk, then returned to Babo in June 1944. They lost 12 planes defending Biak, and were then disbanded. By mid-1944, the base was in range of medium bombers and ground attack planes from the United States Army Air Forces 5th Air Force, and came under heavy attack. It was neutralized from the air around October 1944, but never liberated by Allied forces. Tons of American and Australian bombs hit the airfield. Many of its aircraft were destroyed by parafrag bombs. Japanese ground crews even sawed off the engines from wrecked planes, in a desperate attempt to ward off further attacks, and used hulks to fill in bomb craters. Isolated from resupply or rescue, the remaining Japanese occupied the area until the end of the war.

It is abandoned and overgrown, disused since 1944. History The airfield was used during the Sansapor-Cape Opmarai Operation, 30 July-31 August 1944 in northern Dutch New Guinea. On 30 July, a task force comprising elements of the United States Army 6th Division made simultaneous and unopposed landings near Cape Opmarai on the mainland, and on Middelburg and Amsterdam Islands to the northwest. Only a few enemy stragglers were encountered. The next day a shore-to shore landing from Cape Opmarai was carried out at Sansapor. As in other New Guinea areas, airdrome construction proceeded rapidly. In a short time airfields at Cape Opmarai and on Middelburg Island and a float plane base at Amsterdam Island were fully operative. The airfield was used as a tactical fighter strip, then abandoned after MacArthur moved into the Dutch East Indies on his drive to the Philippines.

In \\"Sports for Peace\\", athletes from all over the world come together to promote the values of sport, such as fair play, tolerance, the Olympic ideal of freedom, international and intercultural understanding. As a politically independent initiative, \\"Sports for Peace\\" offers a neutral basis to foster the spirit of fair play, the sense of community and the elimination of prejudice. The initiative is based in Berlin. Purpose Everywhere in the world sport plays an important role in society, for it is capable of conveying basic rules and essential values of peaceful coexistence ‚Äì such as tolerance, team spirit, loyalty and fair play. In addition, sport is especially suitable to form character skills, which are important for a fulfilling and happy life, because sport as a medium also gives the value of discipline, endurance, courage and self-motivation. By conveying the ethics of sport, it also lays the foundations for a more peaceful, humane world. Projects 2008 \\"Sports for Peace\\" published in cooperation with Amnesty International and the International Campaign for Tibet an ad in the International Herald Tribune which accompanied the start of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. More than 100 sportsmen from all over the world signed an open letter to the Chinese government expressing their desire not only to see a successful sports festival in Beijing, but also to call for respect concerning Olympic ideals and basic human rights. 2009 On the occasion of the 12th IAAF World Championships in Athletics 2009 in Berlin \\"Sports for Peace\\" celebrated its official inauguration with legends of sports. The \\"Sport of Peace\\" Awards of 2009 were handed over to exemplary persons who met their function as role models in a very special way. The award winner IOC Vice President Sergej Bubka has been investing in the sports association of this home town Donetsk for several years thus lending children a sporting home as well as young sports talents such as Yelena Isinbayeva. In his acceptance speech he stated:‚ÄùI feel honoured because this prize represents the full recognition of the work that my colleagues and I have been doing so far\\". Dr. Edwin Moses, another \\"Sports for Peace\\" Award winner and renowned worldwide ambassador for sports ethics and a chairperson of the Laureus World of Sport Academy, responded to his prize: \\"I am receiving this award in the name of my colleagues at Laureus Sports Foundation. Everywhere in the world we need social involvement and that is why I wholeheartedly welcome the 'Sports for Peace' initiative\\". The Iranian National Football team received an award for wearing green wristbands in their game against South Korea to express their solidarity with the movement towards freedom and democracy in Iran. 2010 In cooperation with the United Nations \\"Sports for Peace\\" will stage a gala-event on the occasion of the FIFA World Cup in South Africa on 8 June 2010 in Johannesburg at Constitution Hill. This venue is the new home of the Constitutional Court and represents the protector of South African basic rights and freedoms. It is the site of the Johannesburg's Old Fort Prison complex, where political leaders like Nelson Mandela but also Mahatma Gandhi were detained. The gala-event became part of the United Nations MDG advocacy campaign, which has the purpose of bringing together a remarkable number of personalities to raise awareness for the urgency to fulfil the UN Millennium Development Goal No. 2: Achieve Universal Primary Education by 2015. Former President of South Africa and Nobel Prize winner Nelson Mandela endorses and supports the whole initiative. Approximately 400 high level personalities from sports, economics, culture and media will attend the event. The UN will also launch the official MDG song performed by 8 African musicians and music groups including the Soweto Gospel Choir.

The margin between Cleland and North was 378 votes in 1933 and 79 votes in 1936 ‚Äì Cleland polled 49.05% of the vote on the latter occasion. Military career For his work as deputy assistant quartermaster general, I Corps, during the campaigns in Libya, Greece and Syria in 1941, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (1942) and mentioned in despatches. In October 1942 he was promoted temporary brigadier. Again mentioned in despatches, Cleland was elevated to Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1945. Administrative career in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea Cleland became administrator, succeeding Jack Keith Murray and chaired the Legislative Council of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea (which became Papua New Guinea) from 1953 until 1964 and directed the introduction of the first House of Assembly elected by full adult franchise; he restructured the public service so that it would be dominated by Papua New Guineans, paid at a rate the country could afford; and he continued the elimination of discriminatory legislation, most obviously ending the liquor ban in 1962. He was knighted in 1961 and retired in 1967. Retirement In retirement Cleland lived in Port Moresby, the only administrator of either territory to choose to stay there. He was pro-chancellor and chancellor (from 1971) of the University of Papua New Guinea, and chancellor (from 1967) of the Anglican diocese of Papua New Guinea. Sir Donald died on 27 August 1975 in Port Moresby.Sir Donald Cleland Pacific Islands Monthly, October 1975, pp93‚Äì94 Accorded a state funeral, he was buried in the cemetery at Bomana. He was survived by his wife, Lady Rachel (n√©e Evans), and their two sons. Rachel continued living in their house on Lawes Road in Port Moresby.

It is bounded to the east by Farjevec Creek and extends west nearly to Drobtinka Creek. The I≈°ka River cuts north through the territory of the settlement west of the main population center. Other watercourses in the settlement include Vala Creek, Capuder Creek, Zidar Creek (), and Salƒçek Creek (), which function as drainage canals for the surrounding farmland. There are tilled fields along the road and meadows behind them. The southern part of the settlement is swampier and is affected by annual flooding. The uncut ≈†otnik peat bog lies next to Farjevec Creek.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije. Name The name ƒårna vas literally means 'black village'. The name is believed to refer to either the black soil of the area found below the peat in the marsh, or more likely to the black color of the traditional wooden houses roofed with peat. The earlier name of the settlement and the surrounding region was Volar; the name ƒårna vas did not come into use until 1846, and did not become an official name until 1876. History The ƒårna Vas area was inhabited in prehistoric times; traps and a dugout made by pile dwellers were found at the Kozler property. ƒårna Vas is the oldest settlement in the Ljubljana Marsh. The first houses were built soon after 1830. None of the original houses in the settlement are preserved. The houses were traditionally built of wood and thatched with straw or roofed with peat because stone houses would have been too heavy for the bearing capacity of the soft marsh soil and it was difficult to transport bricks to the area from far away using the poor roads. Masonry and brick houses were built only after all of the peat had been extracted. Parish church The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Michael and is known as Saint Michael in the Marsh (). It belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ljubljana. It was designed by the Slovene architect Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik and built between 1937 and 1939.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number e≈°d 79 Notable people Notable people that were born or lived in ƒårna Vas include: *Fran ƒårnagoj (a.k.a.

This type of time-domain reflectometry can be used in various high-noise and live environments. Additionally, SSTDR systems have the additional benefit of being able to precisely locate the position of the fault. Specifically, SSTDR is accurate to within a few centimeters for wires carrying 400 Hz aircraft signals as well as MIL-STD-1553 data bus signals.Smith,Paul, Furse, Cynthia and Gunther, Jacob. \\"Analysis of Spread Spectrum Time Domain Reflectometry for Wire Fault Location.\\" IEEE Sensors Journal. December, 2005. AN SSTDR system can be run on a live wire because the spread spectrum signals can be isolated from the system noise and activity. At the most basic level, the system works by sending spread spectrum signals down a wireline and waiting for those signals to be reflected back to the SSTDR system. The reflected signal is then correlated with a copy of the sent signal. Mathematical algorithms are applied to both the shape and timing of the signals to locate either the short or the end of an open circuit. Detecting intermittent faults in live wires Spread-spectrum time domain reflectometry is used in detecting intermittent faults in live wires. From buildings and homes to aircraft and naval ships, this technology can discover irregular shorts on live wire running 400 Hz, 115 V. For accurate location of a wiring system's fault the SSTDR associates the PN code with the signal on the line then stores the exact location of the correlation before the arc dissipates. Present SSTDR can collect a complete data set in under 5 ms.

It belongs to the City Municipality of Ljubljana. It was part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included with the rest of the municipality in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region.Ljubljana municipal site Name Janzhe written in the Bohoriƒç alphabet Janƒçe was first attested in written sources as Iance in 1581. The name is derived from the personal name Jan, from Middle High German Johann 'John'. The morphology of the demonym Janƒçar indicates that the settlement likely originally had a longer name, such as Janƒçe selo/brdo/polje (literally, 'John's village/hill/field').Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 174. The settlement is known as Janƒçje in the local dialect and was called Jantschberg in German in the past. History There is evidence that the Janƒçe area was already settled in prehistoric times. Janƒçe had a prominent role during the 19th-century Slovene national revival. On 23 May 1869, the villagers attacked a demonstration in the village by the ethnic German gymnastics club from Ljubljana (). The villagers seized the club's banner and beat the participants, who fled to the paper factory in Vevƒçe to take refuge. In response, the Austro-Hungarian authorities sent troops to the village to pacify the residents. Several farmers were imprisoned, and Jakob Rode was killed in the conflict. During the Second World War, the Partisan commander of the ≈†tiƒçna Company, Jo≈æe Kovaƒçiƒç (1916‚Äì1942), was killed near the village in an engagement with German forces. Kovaƒçiƒç was later proclaimed a People's Hero of Yugoslavia. A hiking lodge was built in 1959 in the middle of the village, with a memorial plaque dedicated to Slovene Partisans of the 2nd group of detachments that fell in the Battle of Janƒçe in May 1942. Church The local parish church is dedicated to Saint Nicholas and belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ljubljana. It was a 17th-century chapel to which a nave was added in the early 18th century and a belfry in 1830.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number e≈°d 1863 A chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes was built next to the church in 1897, after the 1895 Ljubljana earthquake, which had its epicenter in the village.

It covers approximately 9 acres with approximately 1/2 mile of riverbank frontage. The park serves as the trailhead for the Chippewa River State Trail. The park also offers a walking labyrinth, a natural amphitheater, and is home to Eau Claire's year-round farmer's market. These amenities make Phoenix Park a major gathering spot, especially during the summer months when the park plays hosts to concerts. The park is owned and operated by the City of Eau Claire. History Completed in 2005, the park is named for the former Phoenix Steel Company (previously Phoenix Manufacturing Company) that resided on a majority of the site (along the Chippewa River frontage) since 1875. Phoenix Steel vacated the site in 1971, and subsequently leased the building for warehousing and storage. In 1981 the city of Eau Claire took ownership of the tax-delinquent site with the intent of eliminating the blight influences of the property. Despite the listing of the industrial buildings in the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, the buildings were demolished per the city's plan in 1985. In 1994 the city and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources worked jointly to remediate the soil contamination from almost a century of industrial operations. The remainder of the brownfield on the Eau Claire River frontage, owned by Northern States Power (later Xcel Energy), was remediated in 2002. The purchase of the land by the city of Eau Claire was aided by the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Fund, a state of Wisconsin fund for conservation, recreation, and waterfront development.https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/lands/PAL/application.html The construction of the park was funded through a mix of Federal funding and Eau Claire Tax Incremental District #8, created to eliminate blight in the downtown area.

Back in Sicily settled in Palermo where he taught music at the Convent of San Domenico, on Via dei Bambinai. He was an exponent of mannerism and set to music verses major poets such as Torquato Tasso and Gabriello Chiabrera in addition to the major poets of the period. He often utilised melodies of other composers, modifying their style but not distorting their compositional integrity. In the 1591 Second Book of ricercars, Verso based his ricercars on the models of his teacher Vinci.

It is a raised lowland bog, and a rare British example of a schwingmoor and a 'subsidence mire' (only two other British examples of the latter exist: Brookhouse Moss SSSI between Congleton and Sandbach, also in Cheshire, and Chartley Moss NNR in Staffordshire). The site was first notified as an SSSI in 1951, and designated as an NNR in 1955, with further acquisitions added to the protected area in 1957 and 2009. It is owned and managed by Natural England. Habitat and species The most important part of the site is a central schwingmoor, a peat bog, in places only a metre thick, floating on a water- filled basin over deep. This may have occurred because of subsidence of salt- bearing rocks below the site, also the cause of undermining of the nearby Wybunbury Tower, which leans from the vertical and has required underpinning. The floating part of the bog is dominated by Sphagnum mosses and common cotton-grass, with cranberry, cross-leaved heath and round-leaved sundew also present. The reserve is important for its invertebrates, which include 95% of the British population of the ten-spotted pot beetle, Cryptocephalus decemmaculatus. Access There are no public rights of way within the nature reserve, but a permitted wildlife walk leaves a public footpath north of Wybunbury Tower, running west over boardwalks towards the centre of the reserve, before heading north through woodland to rejoin the footpath network south of Cockshades Farm. The central, wettest part of the moss is not publicly accessible for safety and conservation reasons and can only be visited by permit-holders or by arrangement with Natural England. Folklore The Moss is the setting for the children's book Nellie Longarms Will Get You... If You Don't Watch Out, by John Bailey and Rose Quigley. In English folklore, the moss is also said to be the home to a headless horseman and 'Ginny Greenteeth'.

Controversy has centered on cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE; commonly known as mad cow disease), and the use of ractopamine as an additive in feeds. The conflict has sometimes been called the \\"beef war\\" in the media,\\"Mere appearance of hurting farmers keeps US beef war alive\\", China Post, 15 February 2012 similar to the UK‚ÄìEU Beef war over BSE.  Bans due to BSE  The discovery of a case of BSE in the United States in December 2003 caused the Council of Agriculture in Taiwan to ban the import of beef and lamb products from the United States. The ban was lifted in April 2005, and reapplied to beef in June 2005 when a second case of BSE was discovered. This ban was conditionally lifted in January 2006, with imports limited to deboned beef from cattle under 30 months old.  Controversy over ractopamine  In October 2006, ractopamine was banned in Taiwan along with other beta-adrenergic agonists. In August 2007, the Department of Health announced that it was setting a limit on the level of residual ractopamine in meat products, effectively replacing the ban. This proved controversial, spurring protests from pig farmers in Taiwan, and the ban was retained. In February 2012, the Central News Agency reported that large quantities of beef imported from the US were being rejected every month due to residual ractopamine having been detected during inspection.  Developments  In November 2009, limitations were relaxed to allow beef with bones still attached to be imported. The new rules also permitted the import of ground beef and internal organs, but it was intentionally made difficult or impossible through technical regulations. The change sparked a backlash in public opinion, and a bill was passed in the Legislative Yuan in January 2010 reinstating the ban on ground beef and internal organs. In March 2012, the Taiwanese government announced that it was moving toward conditionally unbanning ractopamine. While the drug would be granted a maximum residual level for beef, it would remain banned for pork, and the ban on the import of internal organs of cattle would remain in place. On 24 April 2012, United States authorities reported that a dairy cow in California was found to be suffering from BSE, the first known case in the country in 6 years. Three days later, on 27 April, legislators belonging to the opposition DPP, PFP and TSU in Taiwan's Legislative Yuan raised a motion to vote on a proposal to temporarily ban the import of all beef from the United States, to remove US beef from store shelves, and to seal cases awaiting inspection at customs. The motion was narrowly defeated 44‚Äì45 when Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin- Pyng voted in opposition. On 25 July 2012, the Legislative Yuan passed amendments to the Act Governing Food Sanitation, authorising government agencies to set safety standards for ractopamine. Following this development, food safety and nutrition exports from the Department of Health agreed on a maximum residual level of 10 ppb for ractopamine in beef on 31 July.  Relevance to Taiwan‚ÄìUS relations  The United States government has made beef exports a key issue in bilateral trade with Taiwan. When the Taiwanese Legislative Yuan reinstated the ban on imports of ground beef and internal organs of cattle in January 2010, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) issued a statement saying that the action undermined Taiwan's credibility as a trading partner, and made future agreements on bilateral trade more difficult. On 27 June 2012, William Stanton, director of the Taipei office of the AIT, said that the issue had become \\"the symbolic embodiment of Taiwan's protected markets\\", noting on the same occasion that \\"Taiwan must undertake very serious reform efforts\\" if it wanted to sign a free trade agreement with the United States or become a member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Biography  Adriana Monti was born in 1951 and has been making independent feminist films since the late 1970s. Much of her filmmaking is collaborative. She began her career in the context of a larger feminist movement in Italy of the 1970s. For her 1983 film Scuola senza fine (School without End), she put together a group of amateur women to make the film. The group of former housewives had completed a 150-hour secondary school diploma course in 1976 and did not want to stop learning after it ended. With the help of their teacher, they formed a study and research group. Monti shot the film about them from 1979‚Äì1981, with the first half of it being made collectively by the group. It was completed in 1983. In 1986, Monti made a documentary called Filo a catena about the conditions of female textile workers. Adriana Monti moved to Canada in 1996. She worked as reporter and story producer at OMNI Television Rogers Media, and started her own company A&Z; Media Ltd. She produced in 2012 Ice Work (a Mark Thompson's Chalmers Award Project), a series of shorts Never too Late to Create, and in 2010 Three Women, Adapting Life, Adopting Lines broadcast by OMNI (Mexico Film Festival, Miami women Film Festival, Italian-Canadian Writer Panel Halifax 2012).

There is a Bauxite reserve which is planned for exploration by the state government through a private venture.Bauxite exploitation from Gandhamardan Hills, Orissa Theology  This hill also has a lot of historic importance as it was once a seat of Buddhist culture. To date many ruins are found on the plateau at the hilltop. According to Hindu theology, Lord Hanuman carried this hill on his shoulders from Himalayas to save the life of Lakshman. In the Tretaya Yug (the Silver Age), Sushena (the expert physician in the Vanara Sena that followed Ram) had suggested Vir Hanuman to bring Bisalyakarani ere dawn, so that Laxman would rise back to life. It was in the middle of the war between Lord Ram and Ravan. Hanuman failed to identify the particular herb and carried on his shoulders a huge Himalayan mass. While flying above and proceeding toward Lanka (the kingdom of Ravan), a portion dropped down. Gandhamardan is synonymous to that portion only. At the northern slope of this hill the Nrusinghanath Temple is located; whereas on the southern slope of this hill is the famous Harishankar Temple. History Sage Drona residing on this mountain belonging to the Mahabharat period used to deliver art of weaponry to the selected few pupils and he was famous for it across the country. The pupils educated and trained in the art of warfare were feared by many warriors of that time. Glowing tributes were paid to Hiuen T‚Äôsang, the champion Chinese traveler, who was attracted by the scenic splendour of Gandhamardan. He has spoken of the flowering Buddhist University of Parimalgiri (po-lo-mo-lo-ki-li), which had its campus on the picturesque Gandhamardan hills.Official website of Bargarh District Bio- diversity The Gandhamardan mountain ranges are a rich source of diversity for medicinal plants. The Botanical Survey of India has reported the existence of 220 plant species of medicinal value. Local people, however, claim that there are more than 500 species of medicinal plants in this area. The flora of the buffer zone is most vulnerable. Many medicinal plant species such as Clerodendron indicum, Rauvolfia serpentina and Plumbago zeylanica, which were once available in plenty, have become scarce. A study recorded 2,700 angiosperms and 125 species of important medicinal plants, out of a total of 220 species of medicinal and quasi-medicinal and economically vital plants.Medicinal plant resources of Gandhamardan hill range, Orissa : An urgent need for conservation Such is its richness in medicinal plants that more than 100 traditional healthcare practitioners live in and around the Gandhamardan hills. These practitioners provide medical facilities to about 50,000 tribal people. There are two Ayurvedic colleges and hospitals on both side of Gandhamardan ‚Äî one in Bargarh district and the other in Balangir. Local people have great faith in Ayurvedic practitioners and in many villages, their main occupation is to collect herbs and supply them to companies such as Dabur and Zandu. Some of these villages include Khandijharan, Manbhang, Magurmal and Cherenga jhanj. A study conducted by M Brahma and H O Saxena of the Regional Research Laboratory recorded the medicinal uses of nearly 200 species, out of which they found the uses of 77 to be new or \\"interesting'. The local communities and the peoples movement in Gandhamardhan hills have been largely responsible for preserving the rich biodiversity of the region. This community has protected their land, forests and resources from being plundered by corporate vested interests. The movement has been a source of inspiration for various struggles across Odisha.

Agency includes status and is on a continuum from assertiveness-dominance to passive-submissiveness; it can be measured by subtracting submissiveness from dominance. Communion includes love and falls on a continuum from warm-agreeable to cold-hostile- quarrelsome. Those with the greatest and least power typically do not assert dominance while those with more equal relationships make more control attempts.Dunbar and Burgoon, 2005 Power and dominance are closely related concepts that greatly impact relationships. In order to understand how dominance captures relationships one must understand the influence of gender and social roles while watching for verbal and nonverbal indicators of dominance.

To date, dominance has been linked to vocal control (Lamb, 1981, as cited in Dunbar and Burgoon, 2005), loudness as measured by amplitude (Burgoon and Hoobler, 2002, as cited in Dunbar and Burgoon, 2005; and Dillard, 2000), pitch as measured by frequency (Burgoon and Hoobler, 2002, as cited in Dunbar and Burgoon, 2005; Dillard, 2000), interruptions (Karawosky et al.., as cited in Youngquist, 2009; Karakowsky, McBey, and Miller, as cited in Youngquist, 2009), disfluencies (Dunbar and Burgoon, 2005), amount of talk time (Burgoon and Hoobler, 2002, as cited in Dunbar and Burgoon, 2005), speech rate or the number of words used in an encounter, and message length (Dunbar and Burgoon, 2005; and Dillard, 2000). An important factor for humans and animals to detect in order to survive is the idea of involvement which can be indicated through change and intensity (Tusing and Dillard, 2000). Vocal characteristics such as amplitude and frequency variation indicate change while speech rate can indicate intensity (Tusing and Dillard, 2000). Those with a high speech rate talk faster and as such are usually perceived as more dominant (Aronvitch; Buller and Aune; Buller and Burgoon; Harrigan et al..; Scherer et al.., as cited in Tusing and Dillard, 2000). Interruptions, vocal control, loudness, pitch, verbosity, speech rate and message length were found to predict perceptions of dominance. In general, interruptions and perceptions of dominance follows a curvilinear relationship (Dunbar and Burgoon, 2005; Youngquist, 2009). Also, when asked to think of typical behaviors of powerful individuals, Obama, Sydni, and Guy (2006) found that those that were thought to hold more power were also perceived to have more successful interruptions as well as fewer disfluencies. As promised earlier, gender differences exist within interruptions too. Youngquist (2009) chose to look at how dominance as indicated by intrusive interruptions is perceived differently depending on the gender composition of dyads. This was done by asking 378 individuals to listen to one of 4 recordings with 3 subsections, each subsection contained 2 interruptions. The recording was paused after each subsection and assessments were made about dominance. In addition, the conversations varied by gender composition, male/male, female/male, etc. with the same actor making a total of six interruptions within one recording. His findings show that overall, female interrupters in the same sex dyad are perceived as most dominant while male interrupters in a cross sex dyad are perceived as least dominant. This is in contrast to Dunbar and Burgoon's (2005) finding that men overall are perceived as the most dominant with increased interruptions. Youngquist (2009) additionally finds that females in the same sex groups, who interrupt, are perceived as more dominant than males in the same sex group. Though an interrupter in the same sex group was seen more dominant than the male in the cross sex group, it was only for the first two interruptions. Also, for the first section of the survey (with two interruptions, in the same conversation) but not the second or third sections it was found that the female interrupter, compared to a male interrupter, was seen as more dominant in a cross sex dyad. Vocal control, loudness, and pitch also have been found to be associated with dominance. Dunbar and Burgoon (2005) had partners and third party observers rate dominance after participating or observing an interaction. Couples were initially separated and asked to write a list of items they would like to spend a hypothetical gift of money on. The couple was then reunited and then asked to jointly decide the top things their money would be spent on. Participants rated their partners' dominance after the interaction while third party observers rated their perceptions during the interaction. They found that observers rated males and females more dominant when they expressed higher vocal control (.76, .70) respectively and only male partners perceived their partner to be more dominant when she had greater vocal control (.23). In an additional experiment, Tusling (2000) used 760 participants and divided them into three groups. Group one watched and listened to a video across various influence goals, while group two was given a transcript of the messages and group three watched the video without sounds. Each group gauged dominance levels using a Likert scale from 1-5. He found that amplitude, a measure of loudness, and amplitude variation, an indicator of change dictated perceptions of dominance. It was also found that frequency, a measure of pitch, and frequency variations were reliable predictors of dominance. Verbosity, speech rate, and message length were all found to be reliable predictors of dominance. The increased amount of words used in an interaction or verbosity was linked to more dominant perceptions by observers for males (.53) and for females (.46) by observers, though only females perceived their partner as more dominant with increased verbosity (.21) (Dunbar and Burgoon, 2005). Tussling and Dillard (2009) found that slower speech rates were found to predict increased dominance perceptions. Shorter messages were also found to predict dominance. Nonverbal indicators Nonverbal communication indicators are most readily located on the face such as Visual Dominance RatioDovido and Ellyson, as cited in Dunbar and Burgoon, 2005), emotions (Kelter, as cited in Hareli and Shomrat, 2009 and indicators expressed through the hands such as adaptor and illustrator gesturesDunbar and Burgoon, 2005 have been linked to dominance. An individual's body can indicate dominance as well through posture, elevation, relaxationBurgoon and Hooble, Cashdan, Schwartz et al.., as cited in Dunbar and Burgoon, 2005 and body lean.Burgoon, Buller, Hale and Deturck, (as cited in Dunbar and Burgoon, 2005) Nonverbal behavioral indicators can be seen in the face through factors like expressiveness, visual dominance ratio, gaze, and emotions, and through the body through body control, posture, lean, openness and gestures. Facial indicators such as expressiveness, visual dominance ratio, and gaze, and as well were all found to relate to dominance. In terms of expressiveness, males, but not females, were rated as more dominant when they were facially expressive (.26, -.36) respectively (Dunbar and Burgoon, 2005). In addition, Carney, Hall, and LeBeau (2005) found that more facial expressiveness was appropriate for those with more power and that these individuals were also more likely to have self-assured expressions. The eyes also have something to offer in terms of dominance. Dunbar and Burgoon (2005) found that higher visual dominance ratios were correlated with higher perceived dominance for males and females (.37, .28) respectively as rated by observers. Also, Carney, Hall, and LeBeau (2005) found that more glaring, more mutual gaze, longer gazing, and more looking while speaking would be more appropriate coming from an individual with more power. Emotions are readily expressed by individuals making it easier to identify expressions of dominance. Hareli and Shomrat (2009) looked at various approach, neutral, and avoidance emotions. They ran two studies in order to understand perceptions of emotions as they related to dominance. Both studies asked participants to gauge levels of dominance. In study one, 208 individuals rated pictures of men and women with different emotions expressed. In study two, 96 individuals watched a male technician fail at his job and then explain himself showing a neutral, angry or shameful expression. Emotions surveyed included approach emotions such as anger and happiness, neutral emotions and inhibitive or avoidance emotions such as shame, fear or sadness. Approach emotions are rated as the most dominant when compared to inhibitory emotions (Carney, Hall, and LeBeau, 2005; Hareli and Shomrat, 2009; Montepare and Dobish, 2003.) In contrast, Montepare and Dobish (2003) found that happiness was perceived as more dominant than anger, while Hareli and Shomrat (2009) found the opposite. Females were perceived as more dominant than males when expressing happiness and males were perceived as slightly more dominant than females when expressing anger (Hareli and Shomrat, 2009). Hareli and Shomrat (2009) also found interesting results as it relates to neutral expressions. For instance, males were seen as significantly more dominant than females when expressing neutral expressions and neutral expressions were seen about as dominant as angry expressions for men, which is more dominant than inhibitory emotions. Inhibitory or avoidance emotions were seen as the least dominant (Carney, Hall, and LeBeau. 2005; Hareli and Shomrat, 2009; Montepare and Dobish, 2003). Sadness as opposed to fear was seen as the least dominant (Hareli and Shomrat, 2009; Montepare and Dobish, 2003). Females expressing fear or sadness were seen as less dominant than males expressing the same emotion (Carney, Hall, and LeBeau. 2005; Hareli, Shomrat, 2009). Sadness and fear were also seen as more fitting for an individual with lower power (Carney, Hall, and LeBeau, 2005) Hareli and Shomrat (2009) found that shame tended to decrease perceptions of dominance more so than anger increases perceptions of dominance for males. For females anger was perceived as the most dominant emotion followed by happiness, then a neutral expression, then fear and least dominant of all sadness. In comparison, anger was perceived as the most dominant expression for males, closely followed by a neutral expression, then happiness, then fear and least dominant of all sadness. Furthermore, body control, posture, lean, and openness all were found to relate to dominance. For instance, Dunbar and Burgoon (2005) found that the more body control a woman had the more observers perceived her as dominant (.27) and that in general the most powerful are also the most facially expressive and the least controlled in their body. Carney, Hall, and LeBeau (2005) found high power individuals were perceived to lean forward, have open body positions, orient towards the other, and have an erect body posture more so than those of less power. In addition, gestures also relate to dominance perceptions. Carney, Hall, and LeBeau (2005) found that high power individuals were more likely to use gestures, initiate more hand shaking and engage in a higher frequency of invasive touch. Dunbar and Burgoon (2005) found that observers rated only males as more dominant with increased use of illustrator gestures. The researchers also found that males perceived their partner to be less dominant when she used more adapter gestures. In conclusion, one can see how dominance is a complex topic. Dominance relates to both power, status, and affiliation. Dominance is seen through manifest behaviors as indicated through the nonverbal and verbal indicators outlined above. Gender differences also exist within dominance perceptions though it depends on if one's work role or ones gender role is more salient. Russel (as cited in Dunbar and Burgoon, 2005) stated that \\"the fundamental concept in social science is power, in the same way that energy is the fundamental concept in physics\\". It is true power and dominance are essential components in all of the world from cells to plants to reptiles, and humans that all have to fight for resources. As humans it is essential to use one's knowledge to make the world a more harmonious place using tools of assessment in order to understand individual and group behavior. This can be done through contemplating gender, social roles, and looking to verbal and non verbal indicators of dominance and submission to see how we as individuals relate to the world and each other. One can use this knowledge to one's advantage, for instance, if a boss is deciding between two individuals who are of relatively equal credentials. An individual could appear more competent by displaying dominant behaviors in reason which would could indicate confidence and the ability for leadership. A knowledge of dominant and submissive indicators could be used to help others in distress feel more equal in a relationship by monitoring one's own dominance displays and possibly by strategically using submissive displays. Overall, it is essential to understand how dominance is manifested in relationships in order to understand how power and dominance influence us. Gender differences Gender variations exist because of differences in our expectations about what is appropriate for a particular gender (sex differences in psychology), what is appropriate depending on the composition of two or more people and whether gender or role norms are most salient. For instance, women who display dominance can be judged differently than men exhibiting the same behavior (Burgoon et al..; Carli and Winn, as cited by Youngquist, 2009). This is because women are perceived as less competitive and dominant than men and are thought to be less likely to display dominance (Burgoon et al., as cited by Youngquist, 2009); a woman who displays dominance might potentially be perceived as more dominant than a man displaying the same behavior because her behavior will be seen as unusual. Gender composition can influence dominant behaviors differently. For instance, individuals in a same-sex group can be perceived to be of equal status and are expected per norms to play fairly (Orcutt and Harvey, as cited by Youngquist, 2009). Gender differences in behavior are often found in mixed sex groups, though some have found that women can become more assertive with men in mixed group settings (Maccoby, as cited in Moskowitz, Suh, and Desaulniers, 1994).Therefore, dominance is more readily perceived when an individual displays a control act in a same sex group as opposed to a mixed sex group. Mixed findings have occurred when one attempts to explain dominance displays by gender or role salience. Moskowitz, Suh, and Desaulniers (1994) believe this is because an individual in a lab has less role salience and more gender salience and therefore is inclined to use more gender stereotypical behaviors in the lab while an individual at work has more role salience and gender differences are thought to be reduced (Johnson, as cited in Moskowitz, Suh, and Desaulniers, 1994). Moskowitz, Suh and Desaulniers (1994) had individuals complete survey forms for 20 days over interactions with individuals at work that lasted over five minutes. Individuals completed an average of four forms a day. The forms were divided out across behavioral indicators to keep participants from selecting the same set of behaviors. The forms had equal amounts of behaviors assessing dominance, submission, agreeableness and combativeness. The researchers found that social roles determined agentic behavior at work, not gender roles. When looking at gender composition and communal behavior it was found that gender role, and not social role influenced communal behaviors. Men were indeed more quarrelsome than women in same sex groups, whereas women were more communal with one another. In addition to gender differences it is important to be able to identify and understand how verbal indicators relate to dominance.

The largest family is the Mantidae (\\"mantids\\"). Mantises are distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats. They have triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks. Their elongated bodies may or may not have wings, but all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged and adapted for catching and gripping prey; their upright posture, while remaining stationary with forearms folded, has led to the common name praying mantis. The closest relatives of mantises are the termites and cockroaches (Blattodea), which are all within the superorder Dictyoptera. Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects (Phasmatodea), other elongated insects such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), or other unrelated insects with raptorial forelegs such as mantisflies (Mantispidae). Mantises are mostly ambush predators, but a few ground-dwelling species are found actively pursuing their prey. They normally live for about a year. In cooler climates, the adults lay eggs in autumn, then die. The eggs are protected by their hard capsules and hatch in the spring. Females sometimes practice sexual cannibalism, eating their mates after copulation. Mantises were considered to have supernatural powers by early civilizations, including Ancient Greece, Ancient Egypt, and Assyria. A cultural trope popular in cartoons imagines the female mantis as a femme fatale. Mantises are among the insects most commonly kept as pets.  Taxonomy and evolution  Green mantis at backyard in Sydney, 2020 Over 2,400 species of mantis in about 430 genera are recognized. They are predominantly found in tropical regions, but some live in temperate areas. The systematics of mantises have long been disputed. Mantises, along with stick insects (Phasmatodea), were once placed in the order Orthoptera with the cockroaches (now Blattodea) and rock crawlers (now Grylloblattodea). Kristensen (1991) combined the Mantodea with the cockroaches and termites into the order Dictyoptera, suborder Mantodea. The name mantodea is formed from the Ancient Greek words (mantis) meaning \\"prophet\\", and (eidos) meaning \\"form\\" or \\"type\\". It was coined in 1838 by the German entomologist Hermann Burmeister. The order is occasionally called the mantes, using a Latinized plural of Greek mantis. The name mantid properly refers only to members of the family Mantidae, which was, historically, the only family in the order. The other common name, praying mantis, applied to any species in the order (though in Europe mainly to Mantis religiosa), comes from the typical \\"prayer-like\\" posture with folded forelimbs. The vernacular plural \\"mantises\\" (used in this article) was confined largely to the US, with \\"mantids\\" predominantly used as the plural in the UK and elsewhere, until the family Mantidae was further split in 2002.Bragg, P. E. (1996). \\"Mantis, Mantid, Mantids, Mantises\\". Mantis Study Group Newsletter, 1:4.Ehrmann, R. 2002. Mantodea: Gottesanbeterinnen der Welt. Natur und Tier, M√ºnster. One of the earliest classifications splitting an all-inclusive Mantidae into multiple families was that proposed by Beier in 1968, recognizing eight families, though it was not until Ehrmann's reclassification into 15 families in 2002 that a multiple-family classification became universally adopted. Klass, in 1997, studied the external male genitalia and postulated that the families Chaeteessidae and Metallyticidae diverged from the other families at an early date. However, as previously configured, the Mantidae and Thespidae especially were considered polyphyletic, so the Mantodea have been revised substantially.Schwarz CJ, Roy R (2019) The systematics of Mantodea revisited: an updated classification incorporating multiple data sources (Insecta: Dictyoptera) Annales de la Soci√©t√© entomologique de France (N.S.)

Fossils of the group are rare: by 2007, only about 25 fossil species were known. Fossil mantises, including one from Japan with spines on the front legs as in modern mantises, have been found in Cretaceous amber. Most fossils in amber are nymphs; compression fossils (in rock) include adults. Fossil mantises from the Crato Formation in Brazil include the long Santanmantis axelrodi, described in 2003; as in modern mantises, the front legs were adapted for catching prey. Well-preserved specimens yield details as small as 5 Œºm through X-ray computed tomography.  Parallel evolution  alt=Mantidfly (Mantispidae) looks much like a mantis without leathery forewings Because of the superficially similar raptorial forelegs, mantidflies may be confused with mantises, though they are unrelated. Their similarity is an example of convergent evolution; mantidflies do not have tegmina (leathery forewings) like mantises, their antennae are shorter and less thread-like, and the raptorial tibia is more muscular than that of a similar-sized mantis and bends back further in preparation for shooting out to grasp prey.  Biology = Anatomy  Wing arrangement of a typical mantis, adult male alt=Mantis wings, the forewing leathery, the hindwing triangular Mantises have large, triangular heads with a beak-like snout and mandibles. They have two bulbous compound eyes, three small simple eyes, and a pair of antennae. The articulation of the neck is also remarkably flexible; some species of mantis can rotate their heads nearly 180¬∞. The mantis thorax consists of a prothorax, a mesothorax, and a metathorax. In all species apart from the genus Mantoida, the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs, is much longer than the other two thoracic segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, allowing for a wide range of movements of the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile. Mantids also are unique to the Dictyoptera in that they have tympanate hearing, with two tympana in an auditory chamber in their metathorax. Most mantids can only hear ultrasound. proximal segment of the grasping part of the leg.alt=Raptorial foreleg of a mantis, armed with long spines Mantises have two spiked, grasping forelegs (\\"raptorial legs\\") in which prey items are caught and held securely. In most insect legs, including the posterior four legs of a mantis, the coxa and trochanter combine as an inconspicuous base of the leg; in the raptorial legs, however, the coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment about as long as the femur, which is a spiky part of the grasping apparatus (see illustration). Located at the base of the femur is a set of discoidal spines, usually four in number, but ranging from none to as many as five depending on the species. These spines are preceded by a number of tooth-like tubercles, which, along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip, give the foreleg of the mantis its grasp on its prey. The foreleg ends in a delicate tarsus used as a walking appendage, made of four or five segments and ending in a two-toed claw with no arolium. Mantises can be loosely categorized as being macropterous (long-winged), brachypterous (short-winged), micropterous (vestigial-winged), or apterous (wingless). If not wingless, a mantis has two sets of wings: the outer wings, or tegmina, are usually narrow and leathery. They function as camouflage and as a shield for the hindwings, which are clearer and more delicate. The abdomen of all mantises consists of 10 tergites, with a corresponding set of nine sternites visible in males and seven visible in females. The abdomen tends to be slimmer in males than females, but ends in a pair of cerci in both sexes.  Vision  Head of alt=Head of a mantis with large compound eyes and labrum Mantises have stereo vision. They locate their prey by sight; their compound eyes contain up to 10,000 ommatidia. A small area at the front called the fovea has greater visual acuity than the rest of the eye, and can produce the high resolution necessary to examine potential prey. The peripheral ommatidia are concerned with perceiving motion; when a moving object is noticed, the head is rapidly rotated to bring the object into the visual field of the fovea. Further motions of the prey are then tracked by movements of the mantis's head so as to keep the image centered on the fovea. The eyes are widely spaced and laterally situated, affording a wide binocular field of vision and precise stereoscopic vision at close range. The dark spot on each eye that moves as it rotates its head is a pseudopupil. This occurs because the ommatidia that are viewed \\"head-on\\" absorb the incident light, while those to the side reflect it. As their hunting relies heavily on vision, mantises are primarily diurnal. Many species, however, fly at night, and then may be attracted to artificial lights. Mantises in the family Liturgusidae collected at night have been shown to be predominately males; this is probably true for most mantises. Nocturnal flight is especially important to males in locating less-mobile females by detecting their pheromones. Flying at night exposes mantises to fewer bird predators than diurnal flight would. Many mantises also have an auditory thoracic organ that helps them avoid bats by detecting their echolocation calls and responding evasively.  Diet and predation  Mantis eating a common bushbrown butterfly, alt=Mantis eating a butterfly Mantises are generalist predators of arthropods. The majority of mantises are ambush predators that only feed upon live prey within their reach. They either camouflage themselves and remain stationary, waiting for prey to approach, or stalk their prey with slow, stealthy movements. Green colored mantis looking for prey that arrives to pollinate the mango bloom Larger mantises sometimes eat smaller individuals of their own species, as well as small vertebrates such as lizards, frogs, fishes, and particularly small birds. alt=Mantis eating a cricket Most mantises stalk tempting prey if it strays close enough, and will go further when they are especially hungry. Once within reach, mantises strike rapidly to grasp the prey with their spiked raptorial forelegs. Some ground and bark species pursue their prey in a more active way. For example, members of a few genera such as the ground mantises, Entella, Ligaria, and Ligariella run over dry ground seeking prey, much as tiger beetles do. Ligariella, a ground mantid that runs down its prey The fore gut of some species extends the whole length of the insect and can be used to store prey for digestion later. This may be advantageous in an insect that feeds intermittently. Chinese mantises live longer, grow faster, and produce more young when they are able to eat pollen.  Antipredator adaptations  Mantises are preyed on by vertebrates such as frogs, lizards, and birds, and by invertebrates such as spiders, large species of hornets, and ants. Some hunting wasps, such as some species of Tachytes also paralyse some species of mantis to feed their young. Generally, mantises protect themselves by camouflage, most species being cryptically colored to resemble foliage or other backgrounds, both to avoid predators and to better snare their prey. Those that live on uniformly colored surfaces such as bare earth or tree bark are dorsoventrally flattened so as to eliminate shadows that might reveal their presence. The species from different families called flower mantises are aggressive mimics: they resemble flowers convincingly enough to attract prey that come to collect pollen and nectar. Some species in Africa and Australia are able to turn black after a molt towards the end of the dry season; at this time of year, bush fires occur and this coloration enables them to blend in with the fire-ravaged landscape (fire melanism). Aggressive mimicry: Malaysian orchid mantises are camouflaged pink or yellow, matching the coloration of local orchids. When directly threatened, many mantis species stand tall and spread their forelegs, with their wings fanning out wide. The fanning of the wings makes the mantis seem larger and more threatening, with some species enhancing this effect with bright colors and patterns on their hindwings and inner surfaces of their front legs. If harassment persists, a mantis may strike with its forelegs and attempt to pinch or bite. As part of the bluffing (deimatic) threat display, some species may also produce a hissing sound by expelling air from the abdominal spiracles. Mantises lack chemical protection, so their displays are largely bluff. When flying at night, at least some mantises are able to detect the echolocation sounds produced by bats; when the frequency begins to increase rapidly, indicating an approaching bat, they stop flying horizontally and begin a descending spiral toward the safety of the ground, often preceded by an aerial loop or spin. If caught, they may slash captors with their raptorial legs. Mantises, like stick insects, show rocking behavior in which the insect makes rhythmic, repetitive side-to-side movements. Functions proposed for this behavior include the enhancement of crypsis by means of the resemblance to vegetation moving in the wind. However, the repetitive swaying movements may be most important in allowing the insects to discriminate objects from the background by their relative movement, a visual mechanism typical of animals with simpler sight systems. Rocking movements by these generally sedentary insects may replace flying or running as a source of relative motion of objects in the visual field. As ants may be predators of mantises, genera such as Loxomantis, Orthodera, and Statilia, like many other arthropods, avoid attacking them. Exploiting this behavior, a variety of arthropods, including some early-instar mantises, mimic ants to evade their predators.

Ant-Mantis.jpgSome mantis nymphs mimic ants to avoid predators.  Reproduction and life history  The mating season in temperate climates typically takes place in autumn, while in tropical areas, mating can occur at any time of the year. To mate following courtship, the male usually leaps onto the female's back, clasping her thorax and wing bases with his forelegs. He then arches his abdomen to deposit and store sperm in a special chamber near the tip of the female's abdomen. The female lays between 10 and 400 eggs, depending on the species. Eggs are typically deposited in a froth mass- produced by glands in the abdomen. This froth hardens, creating a protective capsule, which together with the egg mass is called an ootheca. Depending on the species, the ootheca can be attached to a flat surface, wrapped around a plant, or even deposited in the ground. Despite the versatility and durability of the eggs, they are often preyed on, especially by several species of parasitoid wasps. In a few species, mostly ground and bark mantises in the family Tarachodidae, the mother guards the eggs. The cryptic Tarachodes maurus positions herself on bark with her abdomen covering her egg capsule, ambushing passing prey and moving very little until the eggs hatch. An unusual reproductive strategy is adopted by Brunner's stick mantis from the southern United States; no males have ever been found in this species, and the females breed parthenogenetically. The ability to reproduce by parthenogenesis has been recorded in at least two other species, Sphodromantis viridis and Miomantis sp., although these species usually reproduce sexually.Bragg, P.E. (1987) A case of parthenogenesis in a mantis. Bulletin of the Amateur Entomologists' Society, 46 (356): 160.Dickie, S. (1996) Parthenogenesis in mantids. Mantis Study Group Newsletter, 1: 5. In temperate climates, adults do not survive the winter and the eggs undergo a diapause, hatching in the spring. As in closely related insect groups in the superorder Dictyoptera, mantises go through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult (mantises are among the hemimetabolous insects). For smaller species, the eggs may hatch in 3‚Äì4 weeks as opposed to 4‚Äì6 weeks for larger species. The nymphs may be colored differently from the adult, and the early stages are often mimics of ants. A mantis nymph grows bigger as it molts its exoskeleton. Molting can happen five to 10 times before the adult stage is reached, depending on the species. After the final molt, most species have wings, though some species remain wingless or brachypterous (\\"short-winged\\"), particularly in the female sex. The lifespan of a mantis depends on the species; smaller ones may live 4‚Äì8 weeks, while larger species may live 4‚Äì6 months.

It has sometimes been observed in natural populations, where about a quarter of male-female encounters result in the male being eaten by the female. Around 90% of the predatory species of mantises exhibit sexual cannibalism. Adult males typically outnumber females at first, but their numbers may be fairly equivalent later in the adult stage, possibly because females selectively eat the smaller males. In Tenodera sinensis, 83% of males escape cannibalism after an encounter with a female, but since multiple matings occur, the probability of a male's being eaten increases cumulatively. The female may begin feeding by biting off the male's head (as they do with regular prey), and if mating has begun, the male's movements may become even more vigorous in its delivery of sperm. Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a ganglion in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior appeared to be an artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such as bright lights or moving scientists. Chinese mantises that had been fed ad libitum (so that they were not hungry) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed. The male engages the female in a courtship dance, to change her interest from feeding to mating. Under such circumstances, the female has been known to respond with a defensive deimatic display by flashing the colored eyespots on the inside of her front legs. The reason for sexual cannibalism has been debated; experiments show that females on poor diets are likelier to engage in sexual cannibalism than those on good diets. Some hypothesize that submissive males gain a selective advantage by producing offspring; this is supported by a quantifiable increase in the duration of copulation among males which are cannibalized, in some cases doubling both the duration and the chance of fertilization. This is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach hungry females with more caution, and were shown to remain mounted on hungry females for a longer time, indicating that males that actively avoid cannibalism may mate with multiple females. The same study also found that hungry females generally attracted fewer males than those that were well fed. The act of dismounting after copulation is dangerous for males, for at this time, females most frequently cannibalize their mates. An increase in mounting duration appears to indicate that males wait for an opportune time to dismount a hungry female, who would be likely to cannibalize her mate.  Relationship with humans = In literature and art  One of the earliest mantis references is in the ancient Chinese dictionary Erya, which gives its attributes in poetry, where it represents courage and fearlessness, and a brief description. A later text, the Jingshi Zhenglei Daguan Bencao (\\"Great History of Medical Material Annotated and Arranged by Types, Based upon the Classics and Historical Works\\") from 1108, gives accurate details of the construction of the egg packages, the development cycle, anatomy, and the function of the antennae. Although mantises are rarely mentioned in Ancient Greek sources, a female mantis in threat posture is accurately illustrated on a series of fifth-century BC silver coins, including didrachms, from Metapontum in Lucania. In the 10th century AD, Byzantine era Adages, Suidas describes an insect resembling a slow-moving green locust with long front legs. He translates Zenobius 2.94 with the words seriphos (maybe a mantis) and graus, an old woman, implying a thin, dried-up stick of a body. Western descriptions of the biology and morphology of the mantises became more accurate in the 18th century. Roesel von Rosenhof illustrated and described mantises and their cannibalistic behavior in the ' (Insect Entertainments). Island, Aldous Huxley reflected on death as a pair of Gongylus gongylodes mated.alt=The thin-legged mantis Gongylus gongylodes Aldous Huxley made philosophical observations about the nature of death while two mantises mated in the sight of two characters in his 1962 novel Island (the species was Gongylus gongylodes). The naturalist Gerald Durrell's humorously autobiographical 1956 book My Family and Other Animals includes a four-page account of an almost evenly matched battle between a mantis and a gecko. Shortly before the fatal d√©nouement, Durrell narrates: M. C. Escher's woodcut Dream depicts a human-sized mantis standing on a sleeping bishop. The 1957 film The Deadly Mantis features a mantis as a giant monster. In the 1967 film Son of Godzilla and other related films, the kaiju called \\"Kamacuras\\" are giant mantis monsters. A cultural trope imagines the female mantis as a femme fatale. The idea is propagated in cartoons by Cable, Guy and Rodd, LeLievre, T. McCracken, and Mark Parisi, among others. It ends Isabella Rossellini's short film about the life of a praying mantis in her 2008 Green Porno season for the Sundance Channel.  Martial arts  Grandmasters of the Shaolin Temple, Shi DeRu and Shi DeYang, demonstrating the Southern Praying Mantis style of martial art Two martial arts separately developed in China have movements and fighting strategies based on those of the mantis. As one of these arts was developed in northern China, and the other in southern parts of the country, the arts are today referred to (both in English and Chinese) as 'Northern Praying Mantis' and 'Southern Praying Mantis'. Both are very popular in China, and have also been exported to the West in recent decades.  In mythology and religion  The mantis was revered by the southern African Khoi and San in whose cultures man and nature were intertwined; for its praying posture, the mantis was even named ' (\\"god of the Khoi\\") in the Afrikaans language that had developed among the first European settlers. However, at least for the San, the mantis was only one of the manifestations of a trickster-deity who could assume many other forms, such as a snake, hare or vulture. Several ancient civilizations did consider the insect to have supernatural powers; for the Greeks, it had the ability to show lost travelers the way home; in the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead the \\"bird-fly\\" is a minor god that leads the souls of the dead to the underworld; in a list of 9th-century BC Nineveh grasshoppers (buru), the mantis is named necromancer (buru-enmeli) and soothsayer (buru-enmeli-ashaga).  As pets  Gray adult female Carolina mantis in human hand Mantises are among the insects most widely kept as pets. Because the lifespan of a mantis is only about a year, people who want to keep mantises often breed them. In 2013 at least 31 species were kept and bred in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. In 1996 at least 50 species were known to be kept in captivity by members of the Mantis Study Group.Bragg, P.E. [editor] (1996) Species in culture. Mantis Study Group Newsletter, 1: 2‚Äì3. The Independent described the \\"giant Asian praying mantis\\" as \\"part stick insect with a touch of Buddhist monk\\", and stated that they needed a vivarium around 30 cm (12 in) on each side. The Daily South argued that a pet insect was no weirder than a pet rat or ferret, and that while a pet mantis was unusual, it would not \\"bark, shed, [or] need shots or a litter box\\".  For pest control  Gardeners who prefer to avoid pesticides may encourage mantises in the hope of controlling insect pests. However, mantises do not have key attributes of biological pest control agents; they do not specialize in a single pest insect, and do not multiply rapidly in response to an increase in such a prey species, but are general predators. They eat whatever they can catch, including both harmful and beneficial insects. They therefore have \\"negligible value\\" in biological control. Two species, the Chinese mantis and the European mantis, were deliberately introduced to North America in the hope that they would serve as pest controls for agriculture; they have spread widely in both the United States and Canada.  Mantis-like robot  A prototype robot inspired by the forelegs of the praying mantis has front legs that allow the robot to walk, climb steps, and grasp objects. The multi-jointed leg provides dexterity via a rotatable joint. Future models may include a more spiked foreleg to improve the grip and ability to support more weight.

He shared the champion apprentice jockey title in 2008 with David Probert and won the Lester Award for Apprentice Jockey of the Year in 2007 and 2008. From 2010 to 2014 he was stable jockey to John Gosden. In 2015 he signed with Godolphin. Buick won his first Group1 race in Canada in 2010 and since then has won Group 1 races in England, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the United Arab Emirates and the United States.He has won three Classics: the St Leger in 2010 and 2011 and the Derby in 2018. Childhood and early career Buick was born in Norway in 1988, where his Scottish-born father, Walter, was Scandinavian champion jockey on eight occasions and his mother, Maria, a dressage rider and showjumper. He has two younger brothers called Martin and Andrew. Buick was riding horses from a young age and used to ride out in the mornings before going to school. He later recalled \\"I didn‚Äôt go much (to school). I rode out most mornings and was always late. My mum wasn‚Äôt too keen but my dad said that if it was what I wanted, crack on.\\"Evening Standard Fluent in Norwegian, Danish, English and German, Buick was a regular visitor to the UK, where he spent summer holidays riding out for trainers Reg Hollinshead, Marcus Tregoning and Andrew Balding. After completing his education abroad, he joined Balding as an apprentice jockey.The Daily Telegraph Buick was very small for his age but had his first ride on 10 August 2006 at the age of 18, on Tiny Tim, trained by Andrew Balding, at Brighton racecourse. Before Buick's first ride, the former Classic-winning trainer Ian Balding had struck a bet with the Tote at 500‚Äì1 on Buick becoming champion jockey before the year 2020. Buick's first win came on the Paul D‚ÄôArcy trained Bank on Benny at Salisbury on 27 September 2006 and by the end of the year he had ridden ten winners, leading Ian Balding to say \\"without question he is the best apprentice we have ever had.\\" Champion apprentice Buick was part of a duel for the 2008 apprentice title, fought between him and David Probert, who like Buick was attached to the Andrew Balding stable and had his first ride on the stable's schoolmaster Tiny Tim.The Guardian While Buick had the advantage of a full season's experience (which had included a first victory at Royal Ascot on Dark Missile in the Wokingham Stakes), Probert had the advantage of a 5 lbs claim and the race for the title went all the way to the final day of the season, with both riders finishing on 50 winners.RT√â For the second year running, Buick was named Apprentice Jockey of the Year at the British horseracing awards ceremony, the Lesters.Financial Times Stable jockey to John Gosden In October 2009 Buick won his first Group 1 race, the E. P. Taylor Stakes in Woodbine, Canada, on Lahaleeb for trainer Mick Channon. In January 2010, he was offered the role of stable jockey to Newmarket-based trainer John Gosden after the trainer parted company with his previous stable jockey Jimmy Fortune.The Guardian 2010 The partnership got off to a perfect start at the Dubai Carnival in March 2010, with Buick winning the Group 1 Dubai Sheema Classic at Meydan on Gosden's Dar Re Mi on what was his first top-level ride (and just fourth ride in total) for the trainer. After the race, Gosden commented on the appointment of Buick. \\"Yes, it is good to be vindicated straightaway. I like his style, I like his intelligence, I like his balance.\\"The Independent Buick and Gosden were to enjoy further Group 1 success together in 2010, with victory in the Arlington Million (Debussy) in August followed by St Leger victory for Arctic Cosmos at Doncaster, giving Buick a maiden Classic success and Gosden a third St Leger victory (Shantou in 1996 and Lucarno in 2007). After the win, Buick said \\"To be standing here is very special. To win a Classic is what every jockey wants to do and it has been my dream since I came into racing\\".The Independent Buick also formed a partnership with the David Simcock-trained two-year-old Dream Ahead, winning the Group 1 Prix Morny at Deauville (giving Buick a first Group 1 success in France) and the Group 1 Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket.The Daily Telegraph The year ended badly for Buick, as he was forced to spend New Year's Eve in hospital having suffered two falls the day before at Meydan Racecourse in Dubai. Having initially thought to have been lucky to escape injury as no bones were broken, he was found to have bleeding on the brain and, after a week's stay in hospital, was forced to sit on the sidelines for six weeks before returning to race-riding.The Guardian 2011 After a successful start to his career as stable jockey to John Gosden in 2010, Buick was tipped by many to challenge for the flat jockeys championship in 2011. However, with the Horseman's Group having set prize-money tariffs specifying the minimum amount of prize-money racecourses should offer for each type of race, Gosden was one of a number of trainers to agree to a boycott of 'under-tariff' races, a stance that led Buick to comment \\"It‚Äôs going to affect me, but I totally agree with it. Something has to be done about it and that‚Äôs the only way it‚Äôs going to be done, by people not running their horses.\\" Nevertheless, Buick was able to ride a century of winners in Britain in a calendar year for the first time and, for the second year running, was successful in five Group 1 contests worldwide. The first of these was a success on Nathaniel in the Group 1 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot in July. Nathaniel had already given Buick the second Royal Ascot victory of his career in the Group 2 King Edward VII Stakes (quickly followed by Beachfire later that day in the Wolferton Stakes) earlier in the season. Dream Ahead, on whom Buick had won two Group 1 races in 2011, won both the Sprint Cup at Haydock over 6f and then the Prix de la For√™t over 7f at Longchamp, in which he beat the star French mare Goldikova, providing Buick with the first Group 1 double of his career, having won the Prix Marcel Boussac earlier that day on Elusive Kate for John Gosden. Buick also won a second successive St Leger with victory on Masked Marvel on what was just his second ride in the race.Liverpool Echo 2012 In 2012, Buick won nine Group 1 races across the globe. One of these victories came in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot aboard Fallen For You, where Buick completed a treble after he won the Albany Stakes aboard Newfangled and the Wolferton Stakes with Gatewood on day four of the royal meeting. Buick said: \\"It's fantastic - these are the days that jockeys dream of. Just to have a horse that runs well at Royal Ascot is very good. To have a winner is fantastic and to have three winners in one day is really amazing.\\"BBC Sport He went away from Royal Ascot with five winners in total. Nathaniel, on whom Buick had won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2011, was bidding to become the third horse in history to win the race back to back after a successful seasonal debut in the Eclipse Stakes two weeks prior. However, after a close photo finish between the 2011 winner Nathaniel and the 2011 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Danedream, the latter prevailed on the bob of a head. The day after the King George, Buick steered the sister of Nathaniel, Great Heavens, to Group 1 success in Ireland in the Irish Oaks on his 24th birthday, making that Buick's fifth Group 1 victory of the year. His other Group 1 victory in Ireland, came on Izzi Top in the Pretty Polly Stakes, on whom he also won the Prix Jean Romanet in France later that year. Buick had three Group 1 victories in France in 2012, the other two being Elusive Kate in the Prix Rothschild and globetrotting Gordon Lord Byron in the Prix de la For√™t. Buick's other Group 1 victory came in the Nunthorpe Stakes during the Ebor Festival at York aboard the Australian mare Ortensia, on whom he also won the King George Stakes at Goodwood that year. Buick brought Ortensia from what looked like an impossible position two furlongs out, to win by a neck from Spirit Quartz. The Gran Premio di Milano gave Buick a Group 2 win in Italy. Buick finished a successful year with well over 100 winners and finished third in the British Flat Jockeys' Championship.BBC Sport 2013 In the 2013 season, Buick won six Group 1 races, including the Yorkshire Oaks and the Irish Champion Stakes on The Fugue.BBC Sport 2014 In November 2014, after another successful season riding for Gosden, Buick signed with Godolphin.The Guardian 2015 On 28 March 2015 Buick rode Prince Bishop to victory in the Dubai World Cup, one of the richest ($10 million) races in horse racing. Prince Bishop was owned by Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum and trained by Saeed bin Suroor.Racing Post In June Buick came second on Jack Hobbs in the Epsom Derby before riding him to victory in the Irish Derby.Racing Post Later that month Buick's ride on Space Age in the King George V Stakes gave Godolphin trainer Charlie Appleby his first Royal Ascot victory.The Guardian 2016 The year started well for Buick with victories at Meydan on Tryster in the Dubai Millennium Stakes and Jebel Hatta.Racing Post At Royal Ascot in June there were wins on Ribchester in the Jersey Stakes and on Hawkbill in the Tercentenary Stakes. At the end of June Buick was handed a 15-day suspension when Highlands Queen, his mount in the Prix de Diane (French Oaks) at Chantilly was judged to have caused interference. The suspension was doubled when Buick called the stewards corrupt, something for which he later apologised. Before the ban came into force he was able to ride Hawkbill to victory in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown.The Guardian In October there was a more fortunate return to Chantilly when two-year-old Wuheida won the Group 1 Prix Marcel Boussac. Buick replaced James Doyle as first pick jockey for Godolphin in 2016. The Guardian 2017 In March Buick achieved his second victory in the Dubai Sheema Classic at Meydan, this time on Jack Hobbs. In May he won the Prix Saint-Alary at Longchamp on Sobetsu. At Royal Ascot Buick rode four winners, including Ribchester in the Queen Anne Stakes. Ribchester had also provided him with another Group 1 win in the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury in May.Racing Post In August he suffered a compression fracture of a vertebra when he fell from Permian, who broke a leg and was destroyed at the end of the Secretariat Stakes in Chicago. He returned from injury in October, and in November won the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf in California on Wuheida.BBC Sport 2018 In 2018, Buick won the Epsom Derby on Masar. It was his eighth ride in the race. After the race he was quoted as saying: \\"It‚Äôs something really special, the Derby, it‚Äôs the pinnacle of our sport, it‚Äôs the holy grail, the be-all and end-all, it‚Äôs everything. It means the absolute world to me.\\"The Guardian Buick rode Blue Point to victory in the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot and he also rode winners in Group 1 races in France, Hong Kong, the Republic of Ireland, the United Arab Emirates and the USA. The year ended on a disappointing note when he received a six-week ban for reckless riding in the Hong Kong Vase at Sha Tin.Racing Post 2019 In March there were two victories for Buick in Group 1 races at Dubai World Cup Night. He was out of action for three months following a fall on the way to post at Ascot in May. At first he was thought to be uninjured, remounting to ride in the race and then riding a winner the following day. He later felt unwell and went to Addenbrooke's Hospital where he underwent tests and was diagnosed with a post head-injury syndrome.Racing Post After returning to racing in August, he won the Vincent O'Brien National Stakes and the Dewhurst Stakes on Pinatubo, and a Group 1 race in Germany on Ghaiyyath. 2020 Buick rode Barney Roy to victory in the Jebel Hatta at Meydan in March, before racing closed down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After racing resumed behind closed doors in the United Kingdom in June, he rode Pinatubo into third place in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket. Ghaiyyath provided him with a victory in the Group 1 Coronation Cup at Epsom Downs Racecourse.

Her later work has been exhibited in London and the Republic of Ireland. Since 1979, Hemmant has focused on drawing and painting. Constant observation of natural forms has inspired large imaginative paintings in which plant life and architecture predominate. A major source of images is her own garden, along with landscapes in Venice and other parts of Italy. Hemmant's work is not conceptual.

Niketas was a leader of the Scholarioi faction in Trebizond during the civil wars of the mid-14th century.  Life  Niketas' parents are not recorded. Because John Lazaropoulos named one of the factions that emerged after the death of Emperor Basil (6 April 1340) the Scholarioi, which was reminiscent of the former Byzantine military unit of the Scholai, George Finlay concluded that his family had its origins with the members of the imperial bodyguard in Constantinople at the time of its fall to the Fourth Crusade.Finlay, The History of Greece and the Empire of Trebizond, (1204-1461) (Edinburgh: William Blackwood, 1851), pp. 360f While it is plausible that refugees from Constantinople relocated in Trebizond, where they restored their fortunes and had heirs, it is more likely a coincidence that Niketas Scholares bore the name of this unit, than that his immediate ancestors held a commission in it. The Scholarioi, who were led by Sebastos Tzaniches the megas stratopedarches, were opposed to the Amytzarantai, who supported the first wife of Emperor Basil, Empress Irene Palaiologina, who had seized the throne after her husband's death. Following a pitched battle fought in the streets of Trebizond, which was ended when the megas doux John the Eunuch marched from Limnia and joined the faction supporting Irene, Niketas and Gregory Meitzomates fled to Constantinople.William Miller, Trebizond: The Last Greek Empire of the Byzantine Era (Chicago: Argonaut, 1926), pp. 47f There they convinced Michael Megas Komnenos to return to Trebizond with them and become Emperor. Escorted by two or three vessels manned with mercenaries, Niketas and Michael Komnenos arrived in Trebizond on 30 July 1341. However, that night aristocratic backers of Anna separated Michael from his supporters while their armed followers slaughtered the sailors Niketas and Gregory brought with them to support Michael's candidacy. The next day Michael was sent to captivity at Oinaion, and a few days later the dethroned Irene was put on a Frankish ship bound for Constantinople.Miller, Trebizond, pp. 50f Niketas and Gregory escaped serious injury in the counter-coup, for Michael Panaretos states that both fled the city and sailed on a Venetian ship to Constantinople, accompanied by Constantine Doranites, his son John, and Gregory Meitzomates' brother Michael, reaching that city on 10 September 1341. There they recruited John Megas Komnenos to be Emperor. John agreed to their proposal, the group hired three Genoese galleys and with two of their own departed Constantinople on 17 August 1342 and took control of Trebizond on 4 September.Panaretos, ch. 11; Greek text in Original-Fragmente, Chroniken, Inschiften und anderes Materiale zur Geschichte des Kaiserthums Trapezunt in Abhandlungen der historischen Classe der k√∂niglich bayerischen Akademie, 4 (1844), abth. 1, p. 20; German translation, p. 48. Miller, Trebizond, p. 51 The aristocrats who elevated John apparently grew dissatisfied with him, for Niketas freed his father Michael from captivity at Limnia and put him on the throne on May 1344, and had John banished to the monastery of St. Sabas. In return, Michael granted Niketas the title of megas doux, Gregory Meitzomates the title of stratopedarches, while Gregory's son was made epikernes, John Kabazites megas logothetes, Niketas Scholaris's son parakoimomenos, Michael Meitzomates amytzantarios, and Stephan Tzanichites received the title of megas konostaulos. Thus the Scholarioi achieved overwhelming control of the government.Miller, Trebizond, pp. 52f The power of the Scholarioi proved unpopular with the populace of Trebizond, who revolted against their oligarchy. In November 1345 Niketas was arrested and imprisoned, along with his associate Gregory Meitzomates and others of their party.Miller, Trebizond, p. 53 However, the Emperor Michael, old and sick, released Niketas from prison and restored to him his former office of megas doux on December 13, 1349. Niketas strengthened his position by marrying the daughter of Michael Sampson, the Intendent of the Palace. Then on December 22, Niketas led a coup that deposed Michael and place on the throne John, the son of Emperor Basil, who took the name of Alexios III of Trebizond. This was the moment of Niketas' greatest power in the Empire.Miller, Trebizond, p. 55 From that moment, Niketas' power started to erode. The young age of the Emperor invited the restless aristocracy to attempt to overthrow him and replace him with one of their own.So argued by Emile Janssens, Trebizonde en Colchide (Bruxelles, 1969), pp. 112f apud Francois Bredenkamp, \\"The Dronatines Family of the 14th Century Byzantine Empire of Trebizond,\\" Byzantaka, 19 (1999), p. 247 The first year and a half of Alexios' reign was wracked with civil strife, which was marked by Niketas being stripped of his rank and becoming the prisoner of Theodore Doranites, known as Pileles. But Pileles, his son, and his son-in-law were strangled in the castle of Kenchrina in July 1352, allowing Niketas to return to power.Miller, Trebizond, p. 57 By that time, young Alexios had strengthened his own position, and no longer needed Niketas. In June 1354 the megas doux fled to Kerasunt, where he and his supporters prepared to resist Alexios. For three months the rebels and Alexios negotiated, apparently hoping to avoid an open revolt. In March of the next year, Niketas, his son the parakoimomenos, and Basil Choupakes the protovestiarios, led a fleet against Trebizond which failed to accomplish anything; that May Emperor Alexios led his own fleet against Kerasunt and captured that city.Miller, Trebizond, p. 58 Niketas was, however, away at Kenchrina which was the rebels' last stronghold, which Alexios promptly besieged. Niketas held out in Kenchrina until October, and the surrender of that city ended the revolt. Although Niketas spent the rest of his life in confinement in Trebizond, Alexios showed his regard for the former megas doux by walking in white robes during Niketas' funeral procession, which were the garb of Imperial mourning.Miller, Trebizond, p. 59  Sources  Further reading  * Category:1361 deaths Category:14th- century Byzantine people Category:People of the Empire of Trebizond Category:Byzantine generals Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Megaloi doukes ","title":"Niketas Scholares"},{"id":"26977276","text":"Alfred Nobel University, Ukraine () is a higher educational institution with the IV level of accreditation.

Warren. It stars Candace Glendenning as a young woman who, after surviving a car accident in which her parents are seemingly killed, is taken in by her uncle and cousin (Michael Gough and Martin Potter), unaware that they are both necromancers who intend to sacrifice her to resurrect the spirit of a supernaturally-gifted ancestor. The film, a production of Warren's newly- formed company Monumental Pictures, was funded by producers Les Young and Richard Crafter with their own money and shot almost entirely on location in Pirbright, Surrey and Shepherd's Bush, London in late 1975. The following year, re-shoots were undertaken to film additional material and more violent, alternative versions of existing scenes with the aim of increasing the film's appeal to audiences in the Far East. In the UK, Satan's Slave was originally released as a B movie. Critical reaction to the film has been mixed, with aspects such as the acting, script and plot drawing a variety of responses. Plot Catherine Yorke, a young woman from London, receives a bracelet from her boyfriend John for her upcoming birthday. She then leaves the city with her parents in the family car to join her father Malcolm's brother, Alexander, for a week at his home in the country. At the turn into Alexander's estate, Malcolm suddenly falls ill at the wheel and crashes the car into a tree. Although the vehicle is only slightly damaged, when Catherine leaves to fetch help it mysteriously explodes, seemingly killing her parents. Alexander, assisted by his son Stephen and secretary Frances, takes the distraught Catherine into the house and gives her a sedative. On waking, Catherine finds the driveway cleared of wreckage and is told that the police have concluded their investigation. Her parents' funeral is conducted later that day on the grounds of the estate. After the ceremony, Catherine finds an old gravestone bearing the name of Camilla Yorke, an 18th-century ancestor of hers who died aged 20 ‚Äì the age that Catherine is about to reach. Over the next few days, as she continues to be hosted by Alexander, Catherine experiences disturbing visions of women being branded, flogged and sacrificed in satanic rituals. She finds herself drawn to Stephen, with whom she becomes romantically involved. Meanwhile, Alexander steals Catherine's bracelet and uses it to channel dark magic that compels John to kill himself by jumping from the roof of a tower block. Frances tells Catherine that Camilla possessed supernatural abilities and that Alexander, who believes in necromancy, intends to resurrect the girl's spirit to increase his own power. Having murdered several women, including his own wife, to test his theories, he has determined that he can achieve this only by sacrificing Catherine, Camilla's direct descendant, when she turns 20 ‚Äì Camilla's age at the time of her death. Frances also warns Catherine not to trust Stephen: having witnessed his mother's sacrifice as a young boy, he has grown into a murderer like his father. Discovering Frances' betrayal, Stephen stabs her to death and locks Catherine away. On the morning of her birthday, Catherine is led into the surrounding woods to be sacrificed by Alexander and his cult but escapes after running a nail file through Stephen's eye. At the entrance to the estate she runs into Malcolm, who claims that both he and her mother survived the car accident. She is then taken back to the house, where Alexander, no longer wearing his ritual robes, claims that her recent experiences were merely hallucinations brought on by the sedative. However, his trickery is uncovered when Catherine pulls back a curtain to find Stephen's bloody corpse. Alexander praises Catherine's brutality and hails her as a true descendant of Camilla. It is then revealed that Malcolm, not Alexander, is the head of the cult. Trapped, Catherine screams, and the picture dissolves to shots of another human sacrifice before fading to black.

According to Steve Green of Flesh and Blood magazine, while the story and \\"Gothic staging\\" are reminiscent of \\"mid-period\\" Hammer horror films, Satan's Slave sets itself apart by adding an \\"overt sadistic undercurrent\\". Nigel Burrell, also writing for Flesh and Blood, describes the plot as \\"a stir-fried mix of Dennis Wheatley and Jess Franco, a familiar witchcraft/family curse theme jostling with deranged Black Mass sequences\\". Critic Adam Locks notes that Satan's Slave uses plot devices typical of 1970s horror films, including settings that amount to \\"nowhere places\\" where characters become lost. He argues that the effect of the Yorkes' car journey is comparable to time travel, defining it as a \\"re-programming for the audience with memories and associations disconnected from the modern and the urban ... In psychogeographical terms of the relationship between the individual and space, there is the clich√©d yet interesting idea of the road leading to nowhere.\\" Locks also compares Satan's Slave, along with other Warren films, to the 1960s TV series The Avengers for the way that it conveys an \\"underlying disquiet\\" about its setting: \\"Behind the fa√ßade of mundane England, threatening figures or forces ‚Äì be they crooks in The Avengers or Satanists in Satan's Slave ... ‚Äì plan to disrupt the everyday world.\\" He observes that through this sense of unease \\"the familiarity of 'Englishness' is transformed and warped.\\" He describes Alexander as an \\"atavistic amalgamation of various icons of British gentlemen\\" ‚Äì among them the \\"chivalrous knight\\", whose moral code he inverts by sacrificing the women in his family. Warren felt that the character and his house were influenced by Hammer films. Anne Billson writes that the country house setting carries \\"echoes of Hammer\\", also stating that the film as a whole picks up where Hammer left off while \\"amping up the nudity and gore\\". Leon Hunt, author of British Low Culture: from Safari Suits to Sexploitation, regards the grim ending as part of an emerging trend in 1970s \\"generation-gap\\" horror films, noting in contrast that Michael Reeves' films of the 1960s had an \\"angry\\", \\"anti-authoritarian\\" tone. He observes that Satan's Slave ends with Catherine trapped by her own family and destined to be \\"consumed\\", commenting: \\"The battle is over and 'youth' has lost.\\" Production After making Her Private Hell (1968) and Loving Feeling (1969), Norman J. Warren had been in negotiations to direct films for Amicus Productions and American International Pictures (AIP). When these deals fell through, Warren and his camera operator Les Young decided to make a film of their own. Satan's Slave was Warren's horror debut as well as the first film by Monumental Pictures, an independent production company formed by Warren, Young and his wife Moira, and fellow camera operator Richard Crafter. Believing that with their limited finances they could only realistically produce either a horror film or an erotic feature, the group decided to make a horror film on the basis that it would enjoy a longer \\"shelf life\\". After several failed attempts to secure a financing deal, they opted to produce the film independently. The film was funded by Crafter and Les Young with their own money: Crafter by selling his shares in Mothercare, Young by selling his car as well as mortgaging his home and Crystal Film Productions, his film equipment company. Warren gives the total budget as either ¬£30,000 or ¬£35,000 (¬£ or ¬£ in ), about half of which took the form of deferred payments. Writing and casting The plot for the film, which was originally titled Evil Heritage, was devised by Warren and the Youngs and expanded by screenwriter David McGillivray, whom Warren had first met while editing Her Private Hell. It was adapted from one of Warren's abandoned projects for AIP: a film titled The Naked Eye, which had been intended to star Vincent Price. McGillivray completed the script in nine days. Warren did not want the film to end with the revelation that Catherine had simply had a nightmare as he viewed dream sequences as clich√©d. Warren says that Candace Glendenning, whom he had seen in Tower of Evil (1972) and other films, was \\"always [his] first choice\\" to play Catherine. Stephen was harder to cast due to the character's complexity; Martin Potter, who had recently played the title role in the TV serial The Legend of Robin Hood, was hired after first-choice actor Michael Gothard withdrew late in pre-production. Potter researched psychopathic behaviour to gain a better understanding of his role. Michael Craze, who plays Catherine's boyfriend John, had appeared in Warren's 1965 short film Fragment. Although the production could not afford Michael Gough's usual fee, the actor accepted the role of Uncle Alexander after reading McGillivray's script and hearing Warren's personal vision for the film. According to Warren, \\"[Gough] was doing something at the National Theatre in London so I saw him in his dressing room, talked him through Satan's Slave and he said yes.\\" Gough agreed to participate on the condition that the production would not interrupt his stage commitments. He was paid ¬£300 () for his role. Filming The film was largely shot in and around the country house of the Baron and Baroness DeVeuce in Pirbright, Surrey over three weeks in December 1975. The house had been the main shooting location in Tigon's Virgin Witch (1971) and would also appear in one of Warren's later films, Terror (1978). Warren recalls the challenges caused by the low budget and how production designer Hayden Pearce found the DeVeuce house: \\"Most places were not suitable or the people were not interested. And because we didn't have any money, we needed a house that also had furniture in it. Hayden was ringing everyone he knew in connection to art departments and someone suggested the mock-Tudor house in Pirbright, and we couldn't believe our luck. Not only did it look great outside but everything in there was genuine - there were wall-to-wall paintings and it was fully dressed.\\" The grounds of the property contained an electrical substation that the crew used for their power supply, eliminating the need for generators. A nearby cottage served as the location for Catherine's home in London. Due to budget constraints, Gough and Potter were required to supply their own costumes. During the production, Gough, who could not be provided with hotel accommodation, stayed with a friend in Barnes. Warren remembers: \\"We would pick him up each day at around 5.45 a.m. ... He would work with us all day, often until midnight, and then we would drive him back to his friend's house, stopping on the way to buy fish and chips.\\" He adds that despite the consistently long hours, Gough \\"never had a word of complaint.\\" Hooded cultists were played by the producers and other members of the crew. Moira Young took over the role of a woman who is sacrificed in the opening scene when the actress who had been booked failed to attend the shoot. While filming on a hill near an Army base, the production found itself surrounded by soldiers on a training exercise. Due to the large amount of noise from the base's firing range, the filming schedule was changed to avoid outdoor shoots whenever it was in use. For the scene of the car explosion, the crew were given permission to film on the base itself; the Army then used the wreckage for target practice before disposing of it. The scenes set inside John's flat were filmed at the home of one of the crew, while the character's suicide was shot at a block of flats in Shepherd's Bush with Les Young serving as Michael Craze's stunt double. To create a \\"falling\\" point-of- view shot, a camera was tied to a bungee cord and then dropped from the roof of the 23-storey building. Young also performed the car crash stunt. Post- production Principal photography was completed shortly before Christmas 1975. Warren then edited the film at home to save money. He was initially reluctant to serve as editor as he feared that this would compromise his vision as director, but ultimately took on the additional role as he \\"so much wanted this film to happen\\". However, as union rules officially limited him to a single role, he was credited only as director. During the editing, it was determined that the film contained an excessive amount of dialogue; consequently, several scenes were either shortened or removed altogether. The latter included a dream sequence involving Catherine and a scene in which the Yorkes bond over tea and Alexander and Stephen learn of the existence of Catherine's boyfriend. According to Warren, \\"the main problem with [the film] was that the plot was very complicated, and actually rather boring. So we just cut out complete scenes where people were explaining things. And a lot of the film doesn't make sense because of those cuts. But it was less complicated, and no one ever questioned the plot.\\" To boost the film's distribution prospects in the Far East, re-shoots were held to increase the levels of gore and nudity. These entailed filming a more explicit version of one of the early scenes, in which Stephen nearly rapes and then brutally murders a young woman called Janice (played by Gloria Walker) who is staying with him. Warren considers this version, in which Stephen ties Janice to a bed and threatens to cut off her nipples with scissors, \\"very unpleasant\\" and expresses his preference for the original. A number of cutaways were shot by Les Young's company, Crystal Film. Warren also wrote in several additional scenes; one of these, in which Catherine has a vision of a Puritan priest (played by McGillivray) overseeing the torture of a young woman, was filmed in the grounds of a nursing home. McGillivray also has a speaking role as the priest conducting Catherine's parents' funeral. The score, composed by John Scott, was recorded in a single session with seven instrumentalists ‚Äì the largest ensemble that the budget would allow. It features a clarinet and gongs accompanied by a piano, xylophone, xylorimba and vibraphone. The film's title was changed from Evil Heritage to Satan's Slave prior to release as the distributor, Brent Walker, believed that the original title was insufficiently \\"commercial\\". Production ended in March 1976. Release and reception Satan's Slave was released in December 1976. In the UK, it was distributed as the B movie in a double feature with Thriller, an AIP release. It was also paired with Ruby. Satan's Slave was commercially successful and was re- released five times during the 1970s. The box office revenue was used to finance Warren's later film Terror. The film had a limited release in the United States, where it was distributed by Crown International Pictures. Critical response In a contemporary review for The Monthly Film Bulletin, Michael Grossbard described Satan's Slave as \\"basically an archaic second feature\\" that \\"looks ... like the sort of subject likely to turn up on Sunday afternoon children's television, with its kids-in-trouble/blame-the- older-generation theme.\\" He considered the plot \\"well constructed and written\\" and the performances \\"never below standard, though it would be nice to see Michael Gough in more demanding parts.\\" Satan's Slave continues to divide critical opinion. AllMovie calls the film a \\"standard effort\\". Awarding two stars out of five, reviewer Fred Beldin comments that Satan's Slave \\"delivers extra gore and skin to keep the attention from wandering off a well-trodden road ... There's no mystery for the viewer, because director Warren isn't shy about introducing the male lead with a scene in which he rapes and murders a flirty blonde.\\" However, he considers it \\"more watchable\\" than Warren's later films. David Parkinson of Radio Times gives the film three stars out of five, concluding that Warren \\"ultimately over-indulges in horror clich√©s and garish set pieces\\". TV Guide magazine describes it as a \\"vile shocker ... full of unappetising gore effects\\", while Time Out considers it an \\"absolute stinker\\", criticising its dialogue and \\"dragged-out\\" theme. By contrast, Martin Unsworth of Starburst magazine names it \\"one of the big underrated movies of the '70s\\" and a \\"vital entry to the British horror pantheon\\". Gary Raymond and Gray Taylor of the Wales Arts Review rank Satan's Slave 21st in their list of the \\"50 greatest\\" lesser-known horror films. Newman, who regards Satan's Slave as the \\"most conventional\\" of Warren's films, compliments its \\"very low-budget imagination\\" as well as Gough's \\"committed\\" performance. Jo Botting of the British Film Institute website Screenonline opines that while the premise is \\"slightly old hat\\", the final plot twists create a \\"satisfying\\" ending. She adds that the film \\"brought a new realism to horror, with its settings in high-rise urban blocks and with suburban ordinariness hiding satanic rituals.\\" Though judging it derivative of The Exorcist (1973), Ralph McLean praises the film, characterising it as \\"pure B-movie junk, but hugely entertaining B-movie junk all the same [...] It will never win any prizes for originality, but who cares about things like that when the cheap thrills are as plentiful as they are here?\\" Dennis Schwartz of the Online Film Critics Society rates the film \\"C+\\", believing it to be \\"directed with high production values but with little else that rocks\\". He considers the script \\"weak\\" and the dialogue \\"abominable\\", the overall film \\"clich√©d\\" and the final plot twist a non- surprise as it is \\"given away in the opening act\\". Despite calling the car crash \\"amusingly badly staged\\", commentator Ian Fryer believes that film's \\"attractive\\" locations and \\"excellent\\" performances make it \\"[look] like a much more expensive production than was actually the case.\\" He adds that the level of violence \\"made the products of the declining Hammer and Amicus studios look like very mild fare indeed.\\" Green writes that despite its \\"formulaic construction\\" the film is Warren's \\"most effective horror entry\\" and \\"head and shoulders above the stalk/slash tedium which would dominate the American industry within five years.\\" Reviewing the film for the website DVD Talk in 2004, Bill Gibron described Gough's character as a \\"grey Sunday drag of a villain\\" and Satan's Slave in general as a \\"near-immobile mess\\", adding: \\"With an ending that repeats, laps and then doubles back on itself, and an overall atmosphere of dismal dissatisfaction, the only suggestive thing about this movie is its titillating title.\\" In another review published in 2012, he gave the film three out of five stars, judging the script \\"silly\\" and the atmosphere \\"often wasted\\" but praising the performances of Gough and Glendenning. He commented: \\"... if you can get past the endless conversations, [the] lack of real suspense, the flawed feeling of familiarity and the dearth of any or all plot twists toward the end ... then by all means saddle up and strap in\\". Ian Jane, also of DVD Talk, writes that while the film has \\"some rather obvious pacing problems\\" and less suspense than a Hammer horror, it still \\"has its moments\\". Unsworth rates the soundtrack nine out of ten, describing Scott's score as \\"a stunning piece of work, melding some erratic styles perfectly and creating a genuine atmosphere of dread with each listen\\". Home media Satan's Slave has been released on home video by Sovereign Marketing, Anchor Bay Entertainment and Scorpion Releasing. It is included on Anchor Bay's \\"Norman Warren Collection\\" DVD box set along with Prey, Terror and Inseminoid.

The official name is Kwan-li-so (Penal-labor colony) No. 16.  Location  The camp is located in Hwasong County (Myonggan County), North Hamgyong Province in North Korea. It is situated along the upper reaches of the Hwasong River in a secluded mountain valley. The western border is Mantapsan, a mountain. On the north and east sides, the camp reaches the Orangchon River valley. The entrance gate is right on the Hwasong River and on the road from Hwasong, west of Hwasong-up (Myonggan-up). The camp is not included in maps, but the entrance gate and the ring fence with watchtowers can be recognized on satellite images.  Description  Hwasong camp is a penal-labor colony in which detainees are imprisoned for life with no chance to be released. With around in area it is the largest prison camp in North Korea. Puhwa-ri (Chos≈èn'g≈≠l: ), north of the entrance gate, is the camp headquarters. The number of prisoners is estimated at 20,000. They are classified as \\"anti-revolutionary and anti-party elements\\" and held on charges such as opposing the succession of Kim Jong-il. Many of the prisoners are merely family members of suspected wrong-doers, who are held captive in a ‚Äúguilt-by-association‚Äù punishment. It is believed that the camp was founded in the 1990s.  Working conditions  Prisoners are exploited for hard, dangerous, and deadly labor in mining, logging and agriculture. According to Mr. Lee, a former security officer in Hwasong camp, the inmates were overworked and had very little time to rest. Prisoners had to work all day until they fulfilled their quotas and attend self-criticism meetings afterwards. Often they were allowed to sleep only four hours in the night. Mr. Lee witnessed many fatal accidents in the workplace. The North Korean nuclear tests made in 2006, 2009, 2013 and 2016 at Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site is just to the west of the camp border. Several defectors reported that political prisoners were forced to dig tunnels and build underground facilities in areas exposed to nuclear radiation.  Human rights situation  Information is extremely limited, as the camp has always been a maximum security camp under strict control and surveillance. An unidentified teenager reported how he was sent to the camp with his entire family at age 13. He witnessed his father being beaten cruelly and his mother and sisters being raped by security officers. Residents from nearby villages heard about the horrific conditions inside the camp, but were never allowed to get near the camp. Security officer Lee explained the methods to execute prisoners in an interview with Amnesty International. He witnessed prisoners forced to dig their own graves and being killed with hammer blows to their necks. He also witnessed prison officers strangling detainees and then beating them to death with wooden sticks. According to him several women were raped by the officials and executed secretly thereafter.  Camp expansion  Analysis of satellite images by Amnesty International in October 2013 shows that the prisoner population of Hwasong camp has slightly increased compared to 2008. In several prisoner villages new housing structures and new administrative buildings can be identified. Some of the new prisoners may have been relocated from Hoeryong concentration camp to Hwasong.  Former prisoners/guards (witnesses)  * Besides the unidentified teenager, no former prisoner was found to provide a direct testimony, probably for fear of retribution. * Mr. Lee (full name withheld for his safety; 1980s - mid-1990s in Hwasong) was a security officer in the camp.

Along with Orton's The Good and Faithful Servant, the play was originally written for the Associated Rediffusion series Seven Deadly Virtues, the sequel to its earlier Seven Deadly Sins, which had included his The Erpingham Camp.Simon Coward, Richard Down & Christopher Perry The Kaleidoscope British Independent Television Drama Research Guide 1955‚Äì2010, Kaleidoscope Publishing, 2nd edition, 2010, page 2911, ) Funeral Games followed the general format of the other plays by other writers in the series, in that viewers were expected to decide which virtue they were witnessing before the answer was revealed in the closing credits. The choices were courage, faith, hope, prudence, justice, charity, and temperance. The Good And Faithful Servant and Funeral Games represented faith and justice respectively, but ultimately only the first was included in the series, with the justice episode being The Whole Truth by John Bowen. Both were directed by James Ormerod, who had previously handled The Erpingham Camp.Simon Coward, Richard Down & Christopher Perry The Kaleidoscope British Independent Television Drama Research Guide 1955‚Äì2010, Kaleidoscope Publishing, 2nd edition, 2010, page 2912, ) The Funeral Games script eventually passed to Yorkshire Television, which produced it - along with an adaptation Entertaining Mr Sloane - as contributions to the Playhouse series. Sloane (directed by Peter Moffatt) was broadcast on 15 July 1968,Simon Coward, Richard Down & Christopher Perry The Kaleidoscope British Independent Television Drama Research Guide 1955‚Äì2010, Kaleidoscope Publishing, 2nd edition, 2010, page 2696, ) and Games (directed by Ormerod) on 26 August 1968,Simon Coward, Richard Down & Christopher Perry The Kaleidoscope British Independent Television Drama Research Guide 1955‚Äì2010, Kaleidoscope Publishing, 2nd edition, 2010, page 2697, ) both post-dating Orton's death. Both these plays still exist. The play can be seen as a satire on the theme of Christian charity. It is also an attack on hypocrisy in general, and on religion and middle-class morality in particular. It displays Orton's hallmarks of black humour, outrageous characters, deliberate bad taste and surreal situations.  Plot  Cult leader, preacher and con artist Pringle hires the thuggish criminal Caulfield to investigate an anonymous report that his wife Tess is having an affair with a defrocked Catholic priest. It seems as if the report is mistaken, and Tess's visits to the priest McCorquodale are innocent. However, McCorquodale has killed his own wife, and buried her in the cellar. Pringle still wishes to kill Tess, but instead tells people she has 'gone away', a classic ploy used when one has killed one's wife. His intention is to gain respect as a killer. Tess agrees to live out of sight with McCorquodale. Pringle's plans are in danger of being ruined when a reporter threatens his new reputation by suspecting that Tess is not dead at all, and accuses Pringle of being innocent.

Funeral Games is considered to be the transitional play between Loot and What the Butler Saw. In common with much of Orton's work, Funeral Games was regarded as very shocking in England on its first production, much more so than it would be now. The script of the play was first published by Methuen (Modern Plays series, 1970), and the play has enjoyed long-term popularity with amateur and fringe theatre companies in England. There was a BBC Radio 4 production in 2008.

CATS is the busiest Paediatric Intensive Care Transport Service in the UK and covers the 50 District General Hospitals in the North Thames and East Anglia regions of England. CATS is part of the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust. Background Only a proportion of hospitals have a Paediatric Intensive Care Unit PICU. Therefore, most critically ill children initially present to hospitals without a PICU. Paediatric Intensive Care Transport Services are designed to provide the safe and rapid transfer of these children to a regional PICU. CATS was created in 2001 as a collaborative service for the North Thames Regional PICU's: The Royal Brompton Hospital, St Mary's Hospital, London and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children. CATS receives ~2200 referral calls and performs ~1200 critical care retrievals each year. Over 75% of these children are too unwell to breathe for themselves and require anaesthesia and a ventilator. A third need inotropic (inotrope) support, and about 5% require inhaled nitric oxide during transport. Telephone advice, liaison with sub-specialist medical services and outreach education are also important parts of the service's activity. National Services and Aeromedical Transport A rescue helicopter operated by Bristow Helicopters on behalf of Her Majesty's Coastguard. Service Level Agreements (SLA) exist with Great Ormond Street Hospital and the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle for ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) retrievals. CATS also provide a paediatric intensive care transport service with Great Ormond Street Hospital for retrieval of children with Vein of Galen malformations requiring radiological ablation. 5-10% of retrievals are performed by air ambulance. This is via both helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft. For many of these urgent long distance transfers, the team works with the aircraft and the crews of HM Coastguard helicopters. International Referrals CATS have moved many paediatric patients internationally. Accreditation and awards ;CAMTS Accreditation CATS has received accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Systems (CAMTS). This independent, non-profit agency audits medical transport services against industry-established criteria. CATS accreditation is for fixed-wing and rotary wing air medical transport services as well as ground inter-facility critical care services. ;Health and Social Care Award Department of Health, Health and Social Care Award, National Winners 2005. The Team thumb NHS intensive care consultants are responsible for service delivery, supervision of junior medical staff, provision of outreach education and service development. All full-time CATS consultant intensivists, cover sessions in PICU/anaesthesia to maintain competencies in their base speciality. A team of full-time CATS nurses is responsible for service delivery, co-ordination of the outreach education program, and in-house training. In addition, over 50 nurses rotate from each of the 3 PICUs to cover the rota. A team of administrators provide 24-hour cover for the Referral Hotline and co-ordinate incoming referrals, teleconferencing and communication with clinical team members. Road ambulance retrievals are provided by St John Ambulance using bespoke CATS designed intensive care ambulances. Media CATS is the subject of an eight-part (8 x 30 minute) series called Children's Emergency, produced by September Films for BBC One. It aired between 4 May and 23 June 2010.

He was known for standing against influences of the Roman Catholic and Protestant Churches. He convened the Synod of Jerusalem to counter the Calvinist confessions of Cyril Lucaris. Dositheus was born in Arachova (today the village of Exochi, Achaea) on 31 May 1641. Little of his early life is known. He was ordained a deacon in 1652 and elevated to archdeacon of Jerusalem in 1661. In 1666, he was consecrated archbishop of Caesarea Palestinae (now ·∏§orbat Qesari, Israel). In 1669, he was elected patriarch of Jerusalem. He became very involved in the state of the Orthodox Church in the Balkans, Georgia, and southern Russia, particularly after Patriarch Cyril Lucaris of Constantinople set forth in his Confession of Faith (1629) his agreement in the doctrines of predestination and justification by faith alone. In 1672, Patriarch Dositheos convened the Synod of Jerusalem that rejected all the Calvinist doctrines and reformulated Orthodox teachings in a manner that distinguished them from Roman Catholicism as well as Protestantism. In correspondence with Peter I of Russia, he objected to Peter's reforms that subjected the Church to the state, particularly with his abolition of the Patriarchate of Moscow. Dositheos failed in his attempt to get Peter to intercede for the Orthodox Church in the peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire in 1700. Dositheos died in Constantinople on 8 February 1707. In 1715, his twelve-volume History of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem was published.

He was an occasional Hindustani classical singer where he followed the Patiala gharana. He was awarded the 1999-2000 Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in Tabla, the highest Indian recognition given to practicing artists, by Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's National Academy of Music, Dance & Drama.

Scott Fitzgerald originally published in the October 1932 issue of American Mercury. Fitzgerald's story is set in the brutal life of the great studios of 1930s Hollywood, with their flocks of actors, writers and directors seething with interpersonal and sexual politics. It is extraordinarily long ‚Äî almost 6,400 words ‚Äî and has a more novel-like than story-like structure, being set across several separate days and settings, though the single driving story and few characters make it a story rather than a novel. Plot Screenwriter Joel Coles spends his Sundays working ‚Äî at the moment he is rewriting a Eugene O'Neill play in which a famous actress is to play the lead. He is \\"twenty-eight and not yet broken by Hollywood\\" after his first six months there. But on this Sunday, he is invited to tea by the director Miles Calman: a big step up for a writer. Stella, Calman's neglected wife, presses highballs on Joel ‚Äî he had promised himself not to drink, especially as the director is loudly opposed to alcoholism ‚Äî and flirts with him. He chats with the director's mother. Overjoyed by the success he is making, he offers to do his party piece, just as people are leaving. Unfortunately, it is a mocking imitation of an independent producer, Dave Silverstein. You don't mock producers in Hollywood, and the audience, including a famous actress, disassociate themselves silently from his act. \\"The faces surrounding him in the gently molded light were intent and curious, but there was no ghost of a smile anywhere; directly in front the Great Lover of the screen glared at him with an eye as keen as the eye of a potato.\\" Joel realises that he has not only made a fool of himself, but been irreparably damaged among people on whom his career depends. Next morning, he writes a horrified, crawling note of apology to Miles Calman. He slinks around the set, so furtive that a security man demands sight of his pass. His buddy Nat Keogh ‚Äî the archetypal heavy drinker of Hollywood ‚Äî tries to laugh him out of it, but it is not until next morning he gets a kind telegram from Stella Calman inviting him to a buffet supper that he is comforted. \\"Crazy Sunday again\\", and Joel lunches alone on \\"trout, avocado salad and a pint of California wine\\" before dressing carefully for Mrs Calman's sister's supper. In a brief leap from the third-person-subjective mode in which he writes most of the story into third-person-omniscient, Fitzgerald writes: \\"Miles and Stella arrived in riding clothes ‚Äî they had been quarrelling fiercely most of the afternoon on all the dirt roads back of Beverly Hills\\". Only now does Fitzgerald describe the director: \\"Miles Calman, tall, nervous, with a desperate humor and the unhappiest eyes Joel ever saw\\". The problem between the couple is her discovery of an affair Miles Calman is having with an actress, Eva Goebel, his wife's best friend. Husband and wife ‚Äî separately and together ‚Äî confide in Joel, then the husband invites him home with them. At home they continue to squabble, using Joel as an intermediary. He realises he is falling in love with her. Back in the studio during the week, Joel phones Miles but Stella answers; she invites him to a dinner and theatre party because her husband will be flying to a big Notre Dame game. Joel cautiously mentions the invitation to Miles, who dithers jealously then decides to take Stella himself, but on a whim invites Joel too. \\"Joel could not get to the dinner. Self-conscious in his silk hat against the unemployment, he waited for the others in front of the Hollywood Theatre and watched the evening parade: obscure replicas of bright, particular picture stars, spavined men in polo coats‚Ä¶\\" Stella appears, stunning in a sparkling ice-blue dress; Miles had decided to fly to the game after all, and she's just got a telegram to say he's starting back. Afterwards ‚Äî paranoid that the crazily jealous Miles might be watching her in secret ‚Äî she invites Joel home. He goes, flirts with her, but is confused ‚Äî \\"I have a strange feeling that I'm a sort of pawn in a spite game you're playing against Miles\\" ‚Äî she continues to get emotionally blackmailing \\"I love you\\" telegrams from Miles ‚Äî it is implied that Joel and Stella have sex. He is preparing to go ‚Äî the phone rings with another telegram and Stella answers ‚Äî the clock strikes midnight as she holds the receiver to her ear, and she falls senseless to the floor ‚Äî \\"The telephone mouthpiece was still grinding and he put it to his ear. '‚Äîthe plane fell just this side of Kansas City. The body of Miles Calman has been identified and‚Äî' He hung up the receiver.\\" \\"Joel thought of Miles, his sad and desperate face in the office two days before. In the awful silence of his death all was clear about him. He was the only American-born director with both an interesting temperament and an artistic conscience.\\" But now, as Stella desperately tries to make Joel stay with her, he realises that he is her only link with Miles, and if he does stay, he is doomed to be a surrogate for the man she loved. History The short story is noteworthy because although Fitzgerald commanded respectable compensation and respect for his work, \\"Crazy Sunday\\" was turned down by nearly a dozen magazines before its eventual acceptance by American Mercury. Fitzgerald is said to have refused all requests to revise the story as suggested, and later mandated, by editors. Thus, the story retained the original length and content, despite any risk of controversy. The story is reportedly based on Fitzgerald's own experiences at a similar party hosted by Norma Shearer and Irving Thalberg during the time Fitzgerald was working in Hollywood. Thalberg, a genius of film who was born with a congenital heart defect and died aged 37 of a heart attack, was the subject of The Last Tycoon, the novel Fitzgerald almost completed when he died. The story also illustrates Fitzgerald's attitude to alcoholism. The story's plot may have been inspired by the March 31, 1931 inflight breakup of a Transcontinental & Western Air airliner, en route from Kansas City to Wichita, which killed Knute Rockne.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Carlisle, the archdeaconry of Carlisle, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of St Andrew, Aikton, St Mary, Kirkandrews-on-Eden with Beaumont, and St Michael, Burgh by Sands. The church contains Norman architecture and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History St Peter's dates from the 12th century. It was restored in 1870‚Äì71 and again in 1882. Architecture The church is built in red sandstone and calciferous sandstone. The nave has a roof of green slate, while the chancel is roofed with sandstone slates. At the west end is an open double bellcote. The plan of the church consists of a three bay nave with a north porch, and a two-bay chancel with a north organ chamber and vestry. The Norman features are the north doorway, a blocked south doorway, the chancel arch, a lancet window in the south wall of the chancel and the head of a similar lancet that has been reset in the north wall of the organ chamber. The north doorway has a single order and a tympanum including a carved figure. The tympanum of the south doorway is decorated with stone of two different colours in three horizontal bands. The chancel arch has zigzag carving and capitals decorated with scallops. In the nave are 19th-century two-light windows with tracery, while the east window has three lights. The internal fittings and furnishings date from the 19th century, as do the wooden panelled ceiling in the nave and the barrel vaulted roof in the chancel. During one of the 19th-century restorations, carved and inscribed stones from the nearby Roman Hadrian's Wall were incorporated into the fabric of the south wall. The chancel contains a trefoil-headed piscina with a recess to its right. The stained glass in the east window is by Morris & Co.; it is a triplet dating from 1871, but is badly preserved. It includes a depiction of Christ and eight angels with musical instruments by William Morris, and of Christ with the flag of St George by Edward Burne-Jones. Another window dating from 1885 is by E. R. Suffling of Edgware Road, London. A further window contains glass by William Wailes. The two-manual organ dates from about 1900 and was made by Albert E.

Prior to being named the Cubs, the team was known as the Key West Conchs from 1972-1974, and the year before that, they were called the Key West Sun Caps. However the team was founded in 1969 as the Key West Padres. History=Padres The 1969 season was the first in the Major League history of the San Diego Padres franchise. Prior to the 1969 Padres, Key West had not played host to a professional team since 1952 when the Key West Conchs of the Florida International League played a partial season at Wickers Stadium. The team would enjoy a successful first season with a 66-64 record, which was good enough for a third-place finish in the Southern Division of the FSL. The 1969 Key West Padres were managed by legendary future Major League manager, Don Zimmer. At the end of the season Padres management would fold the team and move much of their minor league operations to the west coast. The City of Key West would not have a team in the 1970 season, however, in 1971 a new team, the Key West Sun Caps would emerge. Sun Caps After not hosting baseball in 1970, the Sun Caps were established. The Sun Caps would not be affiliated with one Major League Club but would rather be known as a Co-Op team, made up of a few players from a number of organizations. The Sun Caps were typically cast-off players and most of the time when a player showed promise he was moved to a different team. They were the only team in the 12 team league that was not affiliated with just one big-league club. As such the Sun Caps suffered through a 45-93 record which placed them dead last in the FSL. Conchs After the 1971 season the Sun Caps would still remain a co- op team, but were renamed the Key West Conchs. The Conchs became affiliated with the Chicago Cubs for the 1974 season, but posted their worst record yet that season: 37 wins - 94 losses. Cubs The next year, 1975, the team was renamed for their Major League affiliate, becoming the Key West Cubs for their final season in Key West. The team would enjoy a successful season with a 65-69 record, which was good enough for a second-place finish in the Southern Division of the FSL. The Cubs would lose in the first round of the playoffs. At the end of the season Cubs management would move the team to Pompano Beach, Florida and rename them the Pompano Beach Cubs. The 1975 Key West Cubs would be the last professional team, to date, to be based in Key West.

Edelstein (November 21, 1944 ‚Äì February 10, 2014) was an American physicist. One of the key developers of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), he was part of the team that developed the first full-body MRI scanner at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, and was the primary inventor of spin-warp imaging, which is still used in all commercial MRI systems. Edelstein‚Äôs contributions to MRI technology include pulse sequence optimization, radio- frequency-coil and gradient-coil design, circuitry improvements, high field imaging, acoustic noise reduction, and the NMR Phased Array. Early life and education Edelstein was born in Gloversville, New York, to Arthur S. Edelstein, an optometrist, and Hannah Edelstein. His father was stationed in Myanmar with the United States Air Force and did not meet his son until he was a year old. His family was Jewish. He grew up in Schenectady, New York and Utica, New York before moving to Northbrook, Illinois, where he graduated from Glenbrook North High School in 1962. He received a Bachelor of Science in physics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 1965, graduating summa cum laude. He then attended Harvard University, earning a master's degree in physics in 1967, followed by his Ph.D in 1974. His thesis, on nuclear physics, was supervised by Robert Pound. Academic awards include the Edmund James Scholar and the 1965 Brahana Prize in Mathematics at the University of Illinois, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Career Edelstein moved to Scotland, where he had two three-year postdoctoral research fellowships: the first at the University of Glasgow, where he worked on gravitational wave detection from 1974 to 1977, and the second at the University of Aberdeen from 1977 to 1980, where he was part of the group that performed the first full-body human MRI scan. Edelstein worked for the General Electric Research and Development Centre in Schenectady from 1980 to 2001, where he continued to work in a group which included colleague Paul Bottomley on the development of GE's MRI technology. He was named a Coolidge Fellow, the highest corporate scientific honor bestowed by GE R&D;, and won the GE Dushman Award for ‚ÄúOutstanding Technical Work on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Imaging and Spectroscopy.\\" After 21 years at GE, he founded MRScience LLC, through which he continued to work on the technology.

Edelstein became a Visiting Distinguished Professor of Radiology at Johns Hopkins University in 2007. During his career, he held 49 patents. Recognition He was named a fellow of the American Physical Society in 1988, Institute of Physics in 1996 and International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) in 1997. He won the Gold Medal from the ISMRM in 1990, and the AIP Prize for Industrial Applications of Physics from the American Institute of Physics in 2005.http://www.ismrm.org/Memoriam/edelstein.htm He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Aberdeen in 2007 and the 2013 Alumni Achievement Award from the University of Illinois. Star Trek controversy In 2010, Edelstein presented a paper at a meeting of the American Physical Society in which he disclosed his findings that the reason that space travel at the speed of light had not been achieved is that according to Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, spaceships would be exposed at such speeds to a dose of radiation that would be fatal to crew members. Edelstein suggested that his calculations showed the crew of the Starship Enterprise would have suffered this fate if their travels had not been fiction.

The bank was put into administration by the Bank of Ghana (BoG) in 2018 and then consolidated with four other defunct banks during Ghana's banking crisis. At the time of its administration the bank was led by his son Dr Kwabena Duffuor jr. In taking over the bank, the BoG cited weak supervisory standards, weak operations and persistent liquidity shortfalls and breaches in its cash reserve requirements as reasons for taking over the bank. At the time of its administration, it was reported that it had a negative capital adequacy of -24% at December 2017 and had been reliant on more than 2.2 billion cedis (US$498m at the time) of liquidity support from the BoG to continue to operate. The bank's Receivers subsequently sued Duffuor, HODA, his son and a number of others for the return of 5 billion cedis in assets. The Receivers allege that Directors and shareholders of the bank engaged in illegal transactions by giving out unlawful loans as well as illegal acquisition of assets in the name of related interests. Duffuor has attempt to regain control of the bank by countersuing the Ghana Government alleging the bank had been effectively expropriated. The lawsuit disclosed that almost all of uniBank's loan book was classed as impaired. His son has also sued the administrator KPMG and its staff alleging deceit and that they aimed to enrich themselves by deliberately misleading the Government into collapsing the bank.

In some systems you buy individual solar panels which are installed in the farm after your purchase. In others you purchase kW capacity or kWh of production. The farm's power output is credited to investors in proportion to their investment, with adjustments to reflect ongoing changes in capacity, technology, costs and electricity rates. Companies, cooperatives, governments or non-profits operate the farms. Centralizing the location of solar systems has advantages over residential installations that include: * Avoiding trees, roof size and/or configuration limitations, adjacent buildings, the immediate microclimate and/or other factors which may reduce power output at the residential location. * Avoiding building codes, zoning restrictions, homeowner association rules and aesthetic concerns. * Not requiring homeowners to have the skills and commitment to install and maintain solar systems. * Expanding participation to include renters and others who are not residential property owners. The Solar Gardens Institute maintains a national directory of community solar projects and organizations. As of 2011, farms encompassed both photovoltaic and concentrating solar power technologies.  Community solar in the United States  An estimated 85% of U.S. residents can neither own nor lease systems because their roofs are physically unsuitable for solar or because they live in multi-family housing. At least 52 projects are under development in at least 17 states, and at least 10 states encourage their development through policy and programs. Federal and other tax policies are necessary to finance community solar farms. U.S. Senator Mark Udall introduced the SUN Act (Solar Uniting Neighborhoods) to extend the existing 30% tax credit to community solar farms in 2010 and 2011. The bill would enable groups of individuals or homeowner associations to develop utility-scale solar power facilities in collaboration with local utilities that would distribute the power and credit owners based on their percentage of investment in the solar farm, extending the tax credits accordingly. ‚ÄúThese projects have the potential to drastically increase the adoption of clean energy nationwide, but the tax code hasn‚Äôt kept up,‚Äù Udall said. ‚ÄúYou can get a 30-percent tax credit for putting a solar panel on your house, but not for investing in a solar farm.‚Äù  California  SolarShares (2007) offers customers of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District the opportunity to buy \\"shares\\" in its solar farm. The electricity generated by each customer‚Äôs ‚Äúshares‚Äù appears as a credit on his or her energy bill, a savings expected to average between $4‚Äì$50 a month, given sunshine variability. For a monthly fee--starting at $10.75 a month (averaging 9%) for a 0.5 kW system--participants opt into solar power production. The current phase is sold out, although plans are in progress to expand capacity. The PVUSA array in Davis, California (2001) provides virtual net metering for city-owned meters. The California legislature passed a law specifically allowing this for this individual array. Senate Bill 43 was signed by Governor Brown on September 28, 2013  Colorado  Colorado legislation passed in 2010 that requires the Public Utilities Commission to rewrite rules to direct investor-owned utilities to offer rebates for community solar gardens. HB10-1342, the Community Solar Gardens Act specified: * Energy must be sold directly to an investor-owned utility. * Utility pays retail + REC‚Äôs. * Utility provides Virtual Net Metering credit on the subscribing customer‚Äôs bill. * System size limited to 2 megawatts (MW). * 6 MW total limit on the program for first three years. * There must be at least 10 subscribers. * Subscribers must be located in same county or city as the solar garden. Subscribers whose county has a population less than 20,000 may subscribe in a neighboring county. * Subscribers may buy up to 120% of their own power use worth of solar power. * Either a for-profit or nonprofit entity may own and administer the solar garden. In Colorado, Xcel Energy customers continue to pay the standard non-energy fees, but can buy enough solar shares to offset 120 percent of their load.  Florida  Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC) has a solar farm that began producing power in October 2013. The municipal utility, which has approximately 55 percent of its 230,000 electric customers living in multi-family housing, sought a unique solution for those wanting to use solar power, but unable to modify the homes they rent or lease. This project also allows those customers the ability to buy into solar without all of the upfront costs. Subscribing customers volunteered to pay a higher rate on their power bill, but they were also able to lock in that rate for the estimated life of the project ‚Äì 25 years. Today, 1,312 solar panels are generating up to 400 kilowatts (kW) of electricity at OUC's Gardenia Operations facility next to Interstate 4. The panels are on three canopies, which have created 151 covered LED-lit parking spaces over about 2.5 acres. A total of 39 customers have subscribed to the project. Each kW of the array‚Äôs 400 kW was sold in blocks, with a limit of 15 blocks per customer. Each block represents 112 kilowatt hours (kWh) on a customer's monthly bill, so the maximum benefit per customer is 1,680 kWh. The average OUC residential customer uses around 1,200 kWh. Any unused power is credited on the account for the next month.  Maryland  Maryland established a community energy pilot program in 2017. The purpose of this program is to invest in Maryland‚Äôs solar industry, diversify the energy resources of the state, and provide renewable energy for all state residents, particularly those who qualify as low-to-moderate income. Several utility companies, including BGE , Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco), Delmarva Power & Light, and Potomac Edison Company (MD) have been working alongside subscriber organizations, including Neighborhood Sun, to provide customers with a subscription to existing solar projects. There are several existing solar farms across Maryland, including the Panorama Landfill project. It is the largest in the US and the first residential solar farm in Maryland. Located in Fort Washington, Maryland on a former landfill, Panorama covers 25 acres of land and contains 19,000 panels.  Massachusetts  The Green Communities Act of 2008 authorized what was formally known as \\"neighborhood net-metering\\", which allowed a group of residents in a neighborhood/town to pool resources to cover the capital cost of a renewable energy installation. Residents of Brewster founded the first cooperatively run solar garden in Massachusetts. The solar garden was built by solar installer My Generation Energy Inc. Each member of the cooperative was to receive benefits from the co-op; including the net-metering credits from the solar garden through Nstar. Known as the Brewster Community Solar Garden, it is a 345.6 kW community solar farm located on Cape Cod. Massachusetts and the Federal government each offered incentives to improve solar economics. A traditional investment in photovoltaics without incentives would take 12 or more years to pay back the initial cost. The incentives lowered the payback period to 6‚Äì10 years. Gardens built by developer Clean Energy Collective started producing power in Newton, Massachusetts in July 2014. The company originally partnered with now-defunct energy efficiency firm Next Step Living and is currently working with the startup Solstice Initiative. The largest community solar-plus-storage farm in the state in Winchendon, Massachusetts was completed in March, 2018 by CleanChoice Energy and Borrego Solar.  New York  New York City is home to some of the first urban community solar farms in the country allowing renters to go solar. Rooftop community solar enables solar to become economically feasible for building owners.  Utah  Electric utilities in St. George built a large photovoltaic facility to exploit 310 days a year with sunlight, and allowed residents to purchase it to supplement conventional energy. The program required no set-up or maintenance for the participant. Participation is sold in whole and half units of 1 kilowatt (‚ÄúkW‚Äù). A 1 kW ‚Äúunit‚Äù on the SunSmart grid cost $6,000. One unit equals approximately 15% of the average home‚Äôs monthly power (or about 140 kWh). A one-time tax credit of 25% of the purchase price, up to a maximum of $2,000, was available from the state of Utah. Purchasers received a monthly energy credit for the energy produced that month by the ‚Äúunit‚Äù of panels.

Over the years Conaty developed a large record collection which he used as source material. In the course of putting together his program he developed a depth of scholarly knowledge on the music of the period, which was frequently displayed on air. Conaty often highlighted once- popular artists who have dropped into obscurity. The program was also a showplace for his humor, often self-deprecating. In 1983, Conaty was hired by program director Jim Lowe at WNEW-AM, a station which at that time featured a pop-standards format, and which was home to well-known DJs specializing in that sort of music, from whom Conaty was able to learn. For a time he hosted Milkman's Matinee, a show that had been on for decades. In the early 1980s, he got a chance to fill in, briefly, as host of Make Believe Ballroom, a show that had previously been hosted by the legendary William B. Williams. When WNEW-AM changed format, WQEW attempted fill the market niche on the New York radio dial playing pop standards, and Conaty moved The Big Broadcast and his Saturday program, The Big Bandstand, from WFUV to WQEW in December 1992. By the late 1990s it was evident that WQEW would also abandon the format, and in 1998 the station became Radio Disney.

Background Farmhouse Among Trees, 1883, Museum Kolekcji Jana Pawla II, Warsaw, Poland (F18) Inspired by the work of Jean-Fran√ßois Millet and others working in the 'peasant' genre, Van Gogh became interested in representing peasant life in his art. To depict the essence and spirit of their life, he for a time lived as they lived, he was in the fields as they were, enduring the weather for long hours as they were. To do so was not something taught in art schools, he wrote, a reflection of his frustrated by traditionalists who focused on technique more than the essence of the subject matter. So thoroughly was he engaged in living the peasant lifestyle that his appearance and manner of speech began to change. This alienated some of his friends and family, but was a cost, he believed, necessary for his artistic development. Drenthe Van Gogh visited the province of Drenthe for three months, staying in Nieuw-Amsterdam,. While there, he explored the countryside still untouched by progress found in larger towns and cities. Cottages (F17) is a study of farm cottages and an outbuilding that Van Gogh found on one of his treks. The dark cottage is set against the evening sky. Here he was greatly impressed by the working poor, but unable to find models for his character studies. Nuenen In 1882, Van Gogh's father became pastor in Nuenen and the family lived at the vicarage at Nuenen, a small village in the North Brabant district of the Netherlands. Having been in Drenthe for several months, Van Gogh came to live with his parents in December 1883 and stayed there until May 1885. During the winter in Nuenen Van Gogh worked on character studies of the local peasants. There was little to be done in the fields and Van Gogh was able to make connections to people through his father, a town minister. Van Gogh's character studies culminated in his famous painting The Potato Eaters. The Cottage (F83) was a home that the De Groot family, immortalized in The Potato Eaters shared with another family. The cottage has double front doors, a split chimney and quarters for two families. Seen in the evening light, the cottage seems peaceful. Van Gogh called the peasant homes \\"human nests\\".

The congregation are in mourning clothes: Van Gogh's father had died in March 1885. It is catalogued as \\"F25\\" in Jacob Baart de la Faille's 1928 The Works of Vincent van Gogh and as \\"JH521\\" in Jan Hulsker's 1978 The Complete Van Gogh. Theft and recovery Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen is held by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. It was stolen on 7 December 2002, along with Van Gogh's early painting of Beach at Scheveningen in Stormy Weather, and remained missing for over 13 years until it was recovered by the Italian Guardia di Finanza at Castellammare di Stabia near Naples in January 2016, without its original frame. Its recovery was not announced until September 2016, and it was subsequently returned to the museum and went back on display in March 2017.

The park has an area of , and is an Italian natural monument. The landscape garden within the park comprises and contains medieval ruins, several oaks, cypresses and poplars, grassy meadows, a wide range of exotic plants from various parts of the world, numerous watercourses and a large variety of rambling roses growing over the stone walls of the ruins. The site is run by the Italian foundation Fondazione Roffredo Caetani. It is open to the public at set times from April to November. Nearby towns include Norma and Sermoneta. Ninfa has been described as \\"the most romantic garden in the world\\". History View from the lake The garden includes the ruins of the ancient settlement of Ninfa, whose name seems to derive from a classical era nymphaeum, a temple dedicated to nymphs, located on an island in the small lake; nymphs were believed to dwell in mountains and groves, by springs and rivers, and also in trees and in valleys and cool grottoes. According to Charles Quest-Ritson's book Ninfa: The Most Romantic Garden in the World, the Gardens of Ninfa's first documented evidence is from Pliny the Younger, who described a temple on the premises dedicated to water nymphs.Quest-Ritson 12-26. The village already existed in the Roman era as a small village in an agricultural area. It was perhaps founded by the Volscians at the feet of the Monti Lepini. In the Middle Ages it was a rich town on the Appian Way. In 1159, Pope Alexander III was crowned there. In 1171 the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa sacked and burned it, after the Pope, his enemy, had taken refuge in the town. View of the park During the Middle Ages Ninfa had more than 150 houses, several churches, mills, bridges, two hospices, a castle and a town hall. The town was encircled by a defensive wall in length with guard towers. The castle was built in the 12th century, located near the lake, outside the city walls. Santa Maria Maggiore was the town's primary church and was most likely built from the 10th century and widened in the first half of the 12th century. The Church of Saint John is dated around the 11th century and is now in ruins. The original structure most likely had a single nave with several lateral chapels and a semicircular apse, of which parts remain. Some traces of frescoes are still visible on the walls of the ruins. Church of Santa Maria Maggiore: ruins with traces of frescoes In the 16th century Ninfa was repopulated by its inhabitants, under the seigniory of the Caetani. Cardinal Nicol√≤ III Caetani ordered the architect Francesco Perugino to build a garden in the area of Ninfa, but this garden fell into decay soon after the Cardinal's death in 1585. During the 17th century it was gradually deserted due to the expansion of the surrounding marshes and the arrival of malaria. By the 18th century the last mill was abandoned. In 1765 the town hall was transformed into a barn by Francesco, Duke of Sermoneta, and, at the same time, Pope Pius VI started a reclamation of the marshes, but the project was abandoned. The garden at Ninfa and its surroundings were a neglected part of the domain of the Caetani family until the 20th century, when the estate was renovated and the garden was transformed. The administration of the garden was left to a nonprofit foundation by Lelia Caetani and her husband, Hubert Howard, the last owners. Ownership of the garden was transferred to the Roffredo Caetani Foundation, named after the father of Lelia Caetani-Howard, which continues to manage the garden.Quest-Ritson 61-78. Garden The bridge The garden was created by Gelasio Caetani beginning in 1921, in the English garden style. Caetani was the son of Lady Constance Adela (Ada) Bootle- Wilbraham and Onorato Caetani, Duke of Sermoneta.Quest-Ritson 36-48. He restored some of the buildings of the medieval town of Ninfa, especially the tower and the town hall, as a summer residence. At the same time, under the guidance of Ada Bootle-Wilbraham, who had already created a garden at Lake Fogliano, he began to plant different plant species that he brought home from his travels abroad. The plants thrived due to the favourable climate: the microclimate is very humid because of frequent rains and the river Ninfa. Quest-Ritson's description of the site: > The garden at Ninfa has a unique setting: the ruins of a medieval town near > Rome. The site is one of sublime romantic beauty, where time seems to stand > still. The garden has achieved cult status among the English and American > gardening cognoscenti. The garden has been called the world's most romantic garden,Quest-Ritson 10. also because of its location: it is \\"a romantic oasis of fertility in the midst of the heavily-industrialised Pontine Plain to the South East of Rome\\". The river Ninfa The garden is crossed by numerous small springs as well as the river Ninfa, which flows south of the garden. Restoration of the garden involved importing plant species from all over the world.Gnoli 281-302. There are over a thousand varieties of plants and trees, such as American walnuts, several ornamental apples, yuccas, Cotinus coggygria, catalpa, cedar trees and many rose bushes, including multicoloured Rosa x odorata 'Mutabilis', the early yellow Rosa hugonis, and the pale pink 'Complicata'. Cultivars grown include the white 'Iceberg', red 'Max Graf', and the following hybrid musk roses: the cream coloured 'Penelope', pink 'Ballerina' and buff coloured 'Buff Beauty'. Many climbing roses are also grown in the garden, including Rosa banksiae, Rosa bracteata, Rosa filipes 'Kiftsgate', known for its vigor and beautiful foliage, the white Rosa 'Mme. Alfred Carri√©re' and the apricot climbing rose 'Gloire de Dijon'. Along the main avenue are cypresses, weeping cherry trees, Himalayan pine, banana trees, Mexican pine and lavender. The rock garden contains Iberis, Eschscholzia, Veronica, golden alyssum (Alyssum saxatile), Aquilegia, Dianthus and pomegranates. Purple flowered Clematis armandii, climbing hydrangea (Hydrangea petiolaris), and poplars grow near the bridge; along the river there are groves of hazelnut trees, Acer saccharinum and Liriodendron tulipifera. Near the bridges are maples, poplars, Photinia serrulata, Gunnera manicata, papyrus, Casuarina tenuissima, jasmine, climbing hydrangea, purple flowered Clematis armandii, wisteria, Liriodendron tulipifera, cedars, wattle and a clump of bamboo from China. Magnolia stellata grows in front of the castle. The garden can be visited only with a guide, following a prescribed route. Fauna Ninfa is located on a major flyway of birds migrating from Africa to Europe. The garden, the river and the lake house a rich variety of fauna, including the brown trout, the Mediterranean trout, Salmo cettii, and 152 species of birds. In 1976, under the auspices of the World Wildlife Fund, approximately within the garden were set aside as a wildlife sanctuary,\\"Oasi di Ninfa\\", Fondazione Roffredo Caetani, archived at the Wayback Machine, 26 May 2010 with brush plantings and wetland creation to encourage birds to nest, and of reestablished native vegetation.

He played representative level rugby union (RU) for England and Yorkshire, and at club level for Liversedge, as a scrum-half, i.e. number 9, and representative level rugby league (RL) for Lancashire, and at club level for Oldham (Heritage No. 8) (captain during the 1895‚Äì96 season) alongside Arthur Lees from 1895, and Leeds, as a , or , i.e. number 6, or.

It is endemic to the southeastern United States. It is found in the coastal plain area of the Mississippi River basin, typically in medium-sized streams with slow currents over sandy substrates where it feeds on midge larvae and other small invertebrates. The slender body is semi-translucent, yellowish with a dozen or so dark bars. This fish has a wide range and is relatively common, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists it as a \\"least- concern species\\". Description The scaly sand darter is an elongated, subcylindrical darter. It has a horizontal mouth with a broad, flat head. Compared to other Ammocrypta species, the body is not as translucent as its relatives and appears to have a yellow tent to the body. Nine to 16 vertically oriented, dusky bars occur along the side of the body and irregular dark, dusky spots are found on the back. The lateral scales seemed to be faintly outlined in black. It has numerous dark spots in front of the eyes that extend to the snout. The cheeks and opercles have an iridescent shade of silver to blue. The scaly sand darter typically has a yellow color under the body and head. The spines of the anal and paired fins have scattered black/dark spots near the base. The membranes of the pectoral and pelvic fins are cream to yellow. The base of the caudal fin is usually white to yellow in color. The males can have submarginal bands in the spinous (harder or tougher fins near the base) and soft dorsal fins and also on the caudal fin. Black marginal bands may occur on the soft dorsal and caudal fins (the end of the fin). Size The scaly sand darter is considered to be a large darter. The adults are often 50‚Äì58 mm (2.0-2.3 in) in standard length. The largest recorded was 63 mm (2.5 in), from Okatoma Creek in Covington County, Mississippi. Habitat They inhabit moderate-sized streams that have slow water current where they feed on the sand bed midge larvae and entomostracans. Primarily found in Coastal Plain habitats in Gulf Coastal drainages from the Pascagoula River drainage, Mississippi, west through the San Jacinto River, Texas. Their range extending up the Mississippi River basin to southeastern Missouri and western Kentucky.Etnier, David A., and Wayne C. Starnes. The Fishes of Tennessee. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1993. Distribution The scaly sand darter is found throughout Mississippi in the Pearl, Coastal, and Pascagoula River drainages of the Gulf of Mexico Basin. They are also widely distributed in the Big Black drainage and the Bayou Pierre system of the lower Mississippi South drainage. Scaly sand darters are also found in the Hatchie River system of Mississippi. Sightings have been made in the western tributaries of the Mississippi River in Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri. The species is also found from western Kentucky and southeastern Missouri south to southern Mississippi and west to eastern Oklahoma and Texas, and in drainage basins of the Gulf of Mexico from the Pascagoula River in Mississippi to the San Jacinto River in Texas. Its population trend is unclear but it is a common species with numerous sub-populations over a wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Taxonomy The scaly sand darter was first formally described in 1882 by the American ichthyologist Oliver Perry Hay (1846-1930) with the type locality given as the Pearl River at Jackson, Mississippi. This species forms a clade with the eastern sand darter (A. pellucida) and the Southern sand darter (A. meridiana). References Ross, Stephen T. Inland Fishes of Mississippi.

Biography He was born in the United States. In 1929 he came with his parents to Poland and lived in Postawy. In 1945 in Vilnius he passed matura and ascended to Congregation of the Mission. From 1945 to 1950 he studied at the Theology Institute of Priest Missionaries and in the Faculty of Theology on Jagiellonian University. From 1950 he was a presbyter in the Roman Catholic Church. From 1950 to 1957 he worked as a lecturer at the Theology Institute of Priest Missionaries. In 1953 he received his doctorate of theology from Jagiellonian University. In 1957 he had to leave the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church, due to exposure of his intimate contacts with women and proof he stole valuable documents from the library of the missionaries cloister in Stradom. With help of the Office of Confessions he became an Old Catholic priest in 1958 and adjunct of the Christian Theology Academy in Warsaw. He continued his academic career as an Old Catholic theologian. In 1960 he attained the rank of docent. In 1966 he became Chair of the Section of Practical Theology of Christian Theology Academy. From 1960 to 1965 he was administrator of the Polish Catholic Church's Diocese of Warsaw. In 1965 he was one of the originators in removing Maksymilian Rode from his function as suzerain of the Polish Catholic Church. Naumczyk was typified as his successor, but he denied becoming a bishop, and so Julian Pƒôkala became the bishop. At this time, Naumczyk was protonotary apostolic and vicar of the Polish Catholic Church. From 1965 he was amanuensis of Council and Presidium of Council of the Polish Catholic Church in the Polish People's Republic. He was considered to be an √©minence grise of the Polish Catholic Church from 1965 to 1969. He died with his family (Ewa, Irena and Jerzy Naumczyk) in the crash of an Antonov An-24 on the north slope of Polica.

He was the commanding officer responsible for the Carandiru massacre. Guimar√£es was killed under unclear circumstances in his S√£o Paulo apartment in 2006. Colonel Guimar√£es joined the state military police at the age 18 and rose to the rank of colonel, the top hierarchy in the S√£o Paulo Military Police. As a colonel in the military police, where he stayed for 34 years, he commanded the Pol√≠cia Militar do Estado de S√£o Paulo and S√£o Paulo metropolitan police. In the 1970s, during the military dictatorship of Brazil, he fought guerrillas in the Vale do Ribeira, S√£o Paulo. 1992 Carandiru massacre Guimar√£es was the high-ranking police officer commanding the S√£o Paulo military police in the infamous Carandiru prison massacre. He repeated that he had a \\"clear conscience\\" and always defended the operation, saying the order to invade the cellblock was meant to save lives as he feared that a fire set by inmates could spread. Guimar√£es was originally charged with 111 counts of murder in June 2001, but the number was later reduced to 102 as there was no evidence police had killed the nine prisoners found stabbed to death. He was initially sentenced to 632 years in prison (six years each for the victims and 20 years for five attempted murders) for his mishandling of the rebellion and subsequent massacre. On 16 February 2006 the conviction was voided by a S√£o Paulo court by 20 votes to two because of mistrial claims; the court accepted his argument that he was only following orders. Human rights groups around the world, such as Amnesty International, denounced the reversal. Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC), one of Brazil's most notorious gangs, is said to have been formed as a response to the event. Political life Guimar√£es entered politics after the massacre, when his name had become known to the general public. He was twice sworn in as a substitute state representative by center-right Brazilian Social Democratic Party: in January 1997 to April 1998 and from January to March 1999. In 2002 he was re-elected (with number 14 111) state representative for S√£o Paulo with 56,155 votes. As a Member of Parliament, the retired colonel made public safety his main banner. Guimar√£es was against the disarming of the population and in favor of stricter rules for detainees, such as the ending of conjugal visits and furloughs. Death On Saturday night September 9, 2006 Guimar√£es was killed by a shot in his abdomen from a .38 caliber weapon. At around 22:30 the following day he was found in his S√£o Paulo apartment in the neighborhood Jardins. The corpse showed no signs of struggle, and the door was left ajar. The body was lying on its back, covered only by a towel. The governor of S√£o Paulo, Cl√°udio Lembo (PFL), ruled out the possible involvement of organized crime in the murder. His body was buried on the afternoon of September 11 in the Horto Florestal cemetery in northern S√£o Paulo. The procession was scheduled to end in the chapel, but this was canceled due to the sheer number of people who followed the ceremony.

It takes polynomial time, and the time is linear in the size of the input to the algorithm. Depending on how it is used, it can find either the solution that is optimal for the participants on one side of the matching, or for the participants on the other side. It is a truthful mechanism from the point of view of the participants for whom it provides the optimal solution. Background The stable matching problem, in its most basic form, takes as input equal numbers of two types of participants ( men and women, or medical students and internships, for example), and an ordering for each participant giving their preference for whom to be matched to among the participants of the other type. A matching is not stable if: In other words, a matching is stable when there does not exist any match (A, B) which both prefer each other to their current partner under the matching. A stable matching always exists, and the algorithmic problem solved by the Gale‚ÄìShapley algorithm is to find one. Solution Animation showing an example of the Gale‚ÄìShapley algorithm In 1962, David Gale and Lloyd Shapley proved that, for any equal number of men and women, it is always possible to solve the SMP and make all marriages stable. They presented an algorithm to do so.Harry Mairson: \\"The Stable Marriage Problem\\", The Brandeis Review 12, 1992 (online). The Gale‚ÄìShapley algorithm involves a number of \\"rounds\\" (or \\"iterations\\"): * In the first round, first a) each unengaged man proposes to the woman he prefers most, and then b) each woman replies \\"maybe\\" to her suitor she most prefers and \\"no\\" to all other suitors. She is then provisionally \\"engaged\\" to the suitor she most prefers so far, and that suitor is likewise provisionally engaged to her. * In each subsequent round, first a) each unengaged man proposes to the most- preferred woman to whom he has not yet proposed (regardless of whether the woman is already engaged), and then b) each woman replies \\"maybe\\" if she is currently not engaged or if she prefers this man over her current provisional partner (in this case, she rejects her current provisional partner who becomes unengaged). The provisional nature of engagements preserves the right of an already-engaged woman to \\"trade up\\" (and, in the process, to \\"jilt\\" her until- then partner). * This process is repeated until everyone is engaged. The runtime complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2) where n is the number of men or women. This algorithm guarantees that: ; Everyone gets married : At the end, there cannot be a man and a woman both unengaged, as he must have proposed to her at some point (since a man will eventually propose to everyone, if necessary) and, being proposed to, she would necessarily be engaged (to someone) thereafter. ; The marriages are stable : Let Alice and Bob both be engaged, but not to each other. Upon completion of the algorithm, it is not possible for both Alice and Bob to prefer each other over their current partners. If Bob prefers Alice to his current partner, he must have proposed to Alice before he proposed to his current partner. If Alice accepted his proposal, yet is not married to him at the end, she must have dumped him for someone she likes more, and therefore doesn't like Bob more than her current partner. If Alice rejected his proposal, she was already with someone she liked more than Bob. Algorithm algorithm stable_matching is Initialize all m ‚àà M and w ‚àà W to free while ‚àÉ free man m who still has a woman w to propose to do w := first woman on m's list to whom m has not yet proposed if w is free then (m, w) become engaged else some pair (m', w) already exists if w prefers m to m' then m' becomes free (m, w) become engaged else (m', w) remain engaged end if end if repeat Optimality of the solution Proof that deferred acceptance is optimal for men The existence of different stable matchings raises the question: which matching is returned by the Gale-Shapley algorithm? Is it the matching better for men, for women, or the intermediate one? In the above example, the algorithm converges in a single round on the men-optimal solution because each woman receives exactly one proposal, and therefore selects that proposal as her best choice, ensuring that each man has an accepted offer, ending the match. This is a general fact: the Gale-Shapley algorithm in which men propose to women always yields a stable matching that is the best for all men among all stable matchings. Similarly, if the women propose then the resulting matching is the best for all women among all stable matchings. These two matchings are the top and bottom elements of a larger structure on all stable matchings, the lattice of stable matchings. To see this, consider the illustration at the right. Let A be the matching generated by the men-proposing algorithm, and B an alternative stable matching that is better for at least one man, say m0. Suppose m0 is matched in B to a woman w1, which he prefers to his match in A. This means that in A, m0 has visited w1, but she rejected him (this is denoted by the green arrow from m0 to w1). w1 rejected him in favor of some man that she prefers, say m2. So in B, w1 is matched to m0 but \\"yearns\\" (wants but unmatched) for m2 (this is denoted by the red arrow from w1 to m2). Since B is a stable matching, m2 must be matched in B to some woman he prefers to w1, say w3. This means that in A, m2 has visited w3 before arriving at w1, which means that w3 has rejected him. By similar considerations, and since the graph is finite, we must eventually have a directed cycle in which each man was rejected in A by the next woman in the cycle, who rejected him in favor of the next man in the cycle. But this is impossible since such \\"cycle of rejections\\" cannot start anywhere: suppose by contradiction that it starts at e.g. m0 \\\\- the first man rejected by his adjacent woman (w1). By assumption, this rejection happens only after m2 comes to w1. But this can happen only after w3 rejects m2 \\\\- contradiction to m0 being the first.  Strategic considerations  The GS algorithm is a truthful mechanism from the point of view of men (the proposing side). I.e, no man can get a better matching for himself by misrepresenting his preferences. Moreover, the GS algorithm is even group-strategy proof for men, i.e., no coalition of men can coordinate a misrepresentation of their preferences such that all men in the coalition are strictly better-off. However, it is possible for some coalition to misrepresent their preferences such that some men are better-off and the other men retain the same partner. The GS algorithm is non- truthful for the women (the reviewing side): each woman may be able to misrepresent her preferences and get a better match.

The part appears in the works St John Passion, St Matthew Passion, and the Christmas Oratorio, as well as the St Mark Passion and the Ascension Oratorio Lobet Gott in seinen Reichen, BWV 11. Some cantatas also contain recitatives of Bible quotations, assigned to the tenor voice. Bach followed a tradition using the tenor for the narrator of a gospel. It exists (and is also often called the Evangelist) in earlier works setting biblical narration, for example by Heinrich Sch√ºtz (Weinachtshistorie, Matth√§uspassion, Lukaspassion, Johannespassion). In contrast, the vox Christi, voice of Christ, is always the bass in Bach's works, including several cantatas.  Music and sources  The Evangelist reports in secco recitatives accompanied by basso continuo only. In the St John Passion the story consists of chapters 18 and 19 of John the Evangelist, the St Matthew Passion tells the complete chapters 26 and 27 of Matthew the Evangelist. The first versions of the St. John Passion contained two additional lines from Matthew mentioning the weeping of the disciple Peter and the tearing of the temple curtain. Bach composed the weeping in an expressive melisma and the tearing in a forceful downward run followed by tremolo, but removed the parts in later versions. The Christmas Oratorio follows Luke the Evangelist for parts 1 to 4, and St. Matthew for Parts 5 and 6. A St Mark Passion after Mark the Evangelist is lost, but has been reconstructed by several scholars. In the Ascension Oratorio the story is compiled verse by verse from different biblical sources. The Easter Oratorio is an exception, as a play of four biblical characters without narration.Alfred D√ºrr. 1971. \\"Die Kantaten von Johann Sebastian Bach\\", B√§renreiter 1999, (in German) Evangelist singers Some tenors are known especially for their rendition of the Evangelist, including: * Theo Altmeyer * Gervase Elwes * Karl Erb, mentioned in Thomas Mann's novel Doctor Faustus as Erbe (in English: Heritage) * Kurt Equiluz * John van Kesteren * Peter Pears * Christoph Pr√©gardien * Peter Schreier * James Taylor * Steuart Wilson  Evangelist in cantatas  The Evangelist narrates in several cantatas.

In Am Abend aber desselbigen Sabbats, BWV 42 (8 April 1725, first Sunday after Easter), the tenor opens after a Sinfonia, accompanied by the continuo in repeated fast notes, possibly illustrating the anxious heart beat of the disciples, when Jesus appears, \\"On the evening, however, of the same Sabbath, when the disciples had gathered and the door was locked out of fear of the Jews, Jesus came and walked among them\\", . In Er rufet seinen Schafen mit Namen, BWV 175 (22 May 1725, Pentecost Tuesday), the tenor sings the opening recitative, \\"Er rufet seinen Schafen mit Namen und f√ºhret sie hinaus\\", .

It competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, with Elio Germano sharing the prize for Best Actor with Javier Bardem for his role in the Mexican film Biutiful directed by Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu. Plot Claudio (Elio Germano) is a young construction worker who lives a happy life with his pregnant wife Elena (Isabella Ragonese) and their two children in Rome. They manage together their daily difficulties with love and complicity. One day at the construction site, Claudio discovers the corpse of an illegal Romanian worker who died while working intoxicated, but decides not to report the discovery for fear that the site will be closed down. His life is further struck when Elena dies while giving birth to their third son Vasco, right after their vacation. This is the beginning of a new phase for Claudio, who now concentrates on becoming richer, and buying \\"things\\" for his three sons in the hopes of making them happier after losing their mom. Claudio blackmails his employer, Porcari, about the dead Romanian worker, demanding his own construction site to supervise in exchange for his silence. Claudio obtains the whole construction business, not only the wall building business. Claudio obtains 50,000 Euros from his drug-dealing neighbour Ari to start the work. One day, the Romanian's former lover Gabriela (Alina Madalina Berzunteanu) and his son Andrei (Marius Ignat) come looking for the missing man, but Claudio does not tell them about the truth. He befriends Gabriela and has sex with her. He offers Andrei a job, and allows him to stay at his apartment with his family. More and more difficulties, however, put Claudio in dire straits. Claudio soon runs out of money and time. The construction work is behind schedule. Claudio also cannot pay the illegal workers, and they eventually quit and steal equipment from Claudio. Later Claudio tells Andrei the truth about his father and Andrei leaves, in anger. Claudio asks Porcari to give him more time for the construction job, but is rejected. Claudio eventually turns to his brother, Piero (Raoul Bova) and sister, Loredana (Stefania Montorsi) to borrow more money for the work. He hires more expensive workers and manages to finish the construction work. He is also able to repay his debts. He encourages Piero to show Gabriela his love. Andrei, however, is still angry with Claudio. The film ends with Claudio allowing all of his children to sleep on his bed he once shared with Elena. Previously, he had forbidden his children to play in, which shows he has changed his vision of life and now gives importance to what has real value.

Life The Beautiful Reader Calinerie Comerre was born in Tr√©lon, in the D√©partement du Nord, the son of a schoolteacher. He moved to Lille with his family in 1853. From an early age he showed an interest in art and became a student of Alphonse Colas at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Lille, winning a gold medal in 1867. From 1868 a grant from the D√©partement du Nord allowed him to continue his studies in Paris at the famous √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in the studio of Alexandre Cabanel. There he came under the influence of orientalism. Comerre first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1871 and went on to win prizes there in 1875 and 1881. In 1875, he won the Grand Prix de Rome for his painting \\"L‚ÄôAnge annon√ßant aux bergers la naissance du Christ\\" (The Angel announcing the birth of Christ to the shepherds). This led to a scholarship at the French Academy in Rome from January 1876 to December 1879. In 1885 he won a prize at the \\"Exposition Universelle\\" in Antwerp.

The book is an investigation into an emerging new movement of young women rediscovering their capacity for innocence. Critical reception for Girls Gone Mild has been mixed. Some positive reviews have praised Shalit for her message that girls can be modest in an over-sexualized society. As one reviewer notes, \\"Adults in authority‚Äîschool administrators, commentators, and government officials‚Äîoften seem to want teens to get only one side of the sexuality story. But girls need‚Äîand want‚Äîan alternative. In letting more and more young Americans know the alternative is out there.\\" Some have criticized Shalit's stance on modesty. Some argue that Shalit's argument implies that a girl's end goal is to remain modest for her ultimate end goal of marriage. Another critique is that Shalit appears to argue that women are responsible for men's behavior.

Utomlyonnye solntsem 2: Predstoyanie) is a 2010 Russian drama film directed by and starring Nikita Mikhalkov. The film consists of two parts: Exodus (2010; –ü—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏–µ, literally 'Prestanding') and The Citadel (2011; –¶–∏—Ç–∞–¥–µ–ª—å). It is the sequel to Mikhalkov's 1994 film Burnt by the Sun, set in the Eastern Front of World War II. Burnt by the Sun 2 had the largest production budget ever seen in Russian cinema ($55 mln), but it turned out to be Russia's biggest box office flop, and received negative reviews from critics both in Russia and abroad. Plot=Exodus The film begins in June 1941. Five years have passed since the lives and destinies of Colonel Sergei Petrovich Kotov, his wife Maroussia, their daughter Nadia, as well as those of Mitya and the Sverbitski family, were irrevocably changed: it has meant five years of incarceration for General Kotov (Nikita Mikhalkov), the former Revolutionary hero betrayed by Stalin. He escapes certain death in the Gulag and fights on the Eastern Front as a private. It has been five years of terror for his wife Maroussia, without the husband she believes is dead and with a daughter who has rejected her. Nadia has spent five years in hiding, proud of her father whom she refuses to disown and whom she believes is alive, despite all reports to the contrary. Mitya (Oleg Menshikov) survived his suicide attempt, and reluctantly continues to execute the orders of a regime he holds in contempt. Stalin, with his nation under attack by former ally Adolf Hitler, recalls many of those whom he has had exiled to the GULAG. He tries to mobilize the Soviet population ‚Äì by any means necessary ‚Äì to rise against the threat of Nazism. Citadel Kotov is now fighting at the front. Nadia, who has survived an attempted rape by German soldiers, is now a nurse risking her own life to save others.

The film received mostly negative reviews from both Russian and western critics.

For example, according to the first film, Nadia would have been 11 in 1941, but she is portrayed as an adult. Critics panned many provocative episodes, such as a German pilot defecating on a Soviet ship, or Kotov's dipping Stalin into a cake. The Russian media reviews were especially hostile to the film, because of its revisionist portrayal of Soviet army and Soviet leaders. As web publicist Dmitry Puchkov noted, \\"like any other nation, Russians don't want to see their fathers portrayed as shit.\\"Tupichok Goblina Western critics were mostly negative as well. The Hollywood Reporter's Kirk Honeycutt criticized the film for \\"sticking too closely to the Kremlin's approved version of World War II and for its promotion of Orthodox Christianity.\\" An American film critic likened its portrayal of the madness of World War II to the American Joseph Heller's Catch-22. According to the critic Oleg Zolotarev, \\"The reasons it has flopped are psychological [not artistic].

It is the best-known of all North American freshwater shrimp, and is commonly used as bait for commercial fishing, especially catfish. Description M. ohione is pale gray with small blue spots and grows up to long. Its first two pairs of legs are clawed, with the second pair larger than the first. The rostrum is curved and contains up to 13 teeth. Distribution The species may be found from North Carolina to Florida on the Atlantic coast of North America, and from the southern tip of Missouri to Louisiana further westward. Despite the common name, the Ohio shrimp is not generally found in the Ohio River anymore. Until the 1930s, it was common in the Ohio River, with the type specimen having been taken at Cannelton, Indiana, and its range in the Mississippi River extended as far north as St. Louis, Missouri. Dams, interbasin transfer of water, and other human activities are thought to be the cause for the decrease in range. In May 2001, two specimens were found in the Ohio River in Joppa, Illinois, the first ones in 50 years, indicating either that the species is returning to its former range, or that prior sampling methods were ineffective. Reproduction Like other Macrobrachium species, the Ohio shrimp is amphidromous. The larvae must live in saltwater and move to fresh water as adults. This is accomplished by having the larvae drift, free- floating, down the river until they reach water where the salinity is high enough to support them. Females carrying eggs may also migrate downstream before releasing the larvae to reduce the time required for travel. A 2008 study by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette discovered that M. ohione larvae are viable for up to five days in fresh water. After this, the likelihood of their molting and surviving in saltwater is drastically diminished. The researchers concluded that dams and other human-erected barriers, by blocking the larval drift, are likely to be the primary reason that Ohio River shrimp are almost non-existent in the Ohio River.

Life and career Tadashi Yoyogi was born in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan on March 18, 1938. For a time he was a manager of an ikebana flower-arranging shop but then joined the pink film company World Eiga in 1963. He started directing first for the small Prima Project (Purima Kikaku) company and then with Watanabe Pro from 1974. His first movie as a director was Memoirs of a Girl of Pleasure („ÅÇ„ÇãÂ∞ëÂ•≥„ÅÆÊâãË®ò„ÉªÂø´ÊÑü) which appeared in 1972. Yoyogi and other young directors were able to bring a new direction to pink film and soon established themselves next to the veteran directors. The Japanese Movie Database entry for Yoyogi lists 9 films with Prima and another 26 with Watanabe Pro up to the beginning of 1981. By 1980 in Japan, market penetration of the VCR was only about 1% and the market for home videos was small but growing and a number of companies started up about this time to take advantage of the new opportunities. Yoyogi directed his first adult video (AV) in November 1981 and soon afterwards founded his own company, Athena Eizou. That first video, , starred Ky≈çko Aizome, and it marked her debut in AV as well. Aizome and Yoyogi would go on to collaborate on a number of other softcore and hardcore projects in the next few years including the August 1982 theatrical film Karei Naru ai no Henreki Aizome Ky≈çko directed by Yoyogi for Joy Pack Film as well as the March 1983 Joy Pack release Ky≈çko Aizome's Somber Reminiscence. Because the new medium of video was cheap and the equipment more portable, a new range of possibilities opened up to the AV director which Yoyogi was the first to take full advantage of. He began his popular AV series Document: The Onanie in 1982, shot in the pseudo-documentary style with an interview with the actress that would become a major component in many subsequent adult videos.Sharp, p.218 The series used real sex and amateur performers to shed light on the \\"hidden sex life of Japan.\\" When Onanie became a surprise success, investors started to move into the new media of adult video and a number of other companies were formed. Yoyogi produced the first of his \\"Onanie\\" (masturbation) series of theatrical films with The Onanie for the Million Film studio in November 1982. This was followed in April 1983 by Orgasm: The Climax (ÔºØÔºÆÔº°ÔºÆÔº©Ôº•Ôºí „Ç∂„Éª„ÇØ„É©„Ç§„Éû„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Çπ) and then in July 1983 by the sequel The Document: Orgasms („Ç∂„Éª„Éâ„Ç≠„É•„É°„É≥„Éà „Ç™„Éº„Ç¨„Ç∫„É†), both released by Joy Pack. The Weissers, in their book Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films describe Orgasm: The Climax as depicting masturbation by a prostitute, a model, a TV personality and a transsexual, and ask \\"But can it really be called a movie?.\\" In The Document: Orgasms, handheld camera technique is used to follow an extended S&M; session designed to lead to \\"orgasmic delight.\\"Weisser p.303 A later entry in the series was Onanie 3: The Vibe (ÔºØÔºÆÔº°ÔºÆÔº©Ôº•Ôºì„Ç∂„Éª„Éê„Ç§„Éñ) from Million in October 1984. In the following years, Yoyogi directed a number of AV series for Athena Eizou including , , , and especially his extended series which was launched in 1993 and reached the 100th installment in December, 2008. Yoyogi has continued directing at Athena Eizou where he maintains a weekly diary and many of his early works are available for download. Volume 108 of his The Interview series was released in April 2010. Yoyogi's activities have also attracted the attention of the world of academia. Masakazu Tanaka, professor and cultural anthropologist at Kyoto University gave a talk ‚ÄúCult-Like Nature of the Activities of a Japanese Porn Director, Tadashi YOYOGI‚Äù before a panel at a conference on Gender and Spiritual Praxis in Asian Contexts, held in September 2006 at Lancaster University and in February 2007, Yoyogi was the subject of a study by Tanaka titled published in the journal ‰∫∫ÊñáÂ≠∏Â†± (Journal of Humanities).

The English translation is by Laurie Thompson and in contrast with Mankell's other well- known novels has been written in the first person.Mankell novels on Harvil Secker website Retrieved 18 April 2010 Plot summary Set around the year 2004, the novel focusses on Fredrik Welin, once a successful orthopaedic surgeon forced to retire early from his professional career. He has retreated to a tiny, remote island in the Stockholm archipelago which he has inherited from his grandparents and is now the sole inhabitant. The island is normally surrounded for at least half the year by thick sea ice which adds to the sense of solitude. Fredrik lives a reclusive and somewhat austere lifestyle in a run-down house, enjoying few luxuries. Welin's only companions are his aged cat and dog. The postman, Jansson is the one regular visitor to the island. Despite this Welin has never become particularly sociable with Jensson. In fact he displays little sympathy for the postman‚Äôs frequent requests to be treated for his medical concerns and has privately diagnosed Jensson as suffering from mild hypochondria.Henning Mankell novel summaries from Official Henning Mankell website Accessed 18 April 2010 One cold winter's day Welin spies a figure out on the ice, struggling to make its way on foot towards his island. This unanticipated encounter leads to a surprising revelation and a journey not only across Sweden, but also back to his childhood and early adult life. The unfolding events force him to confront painful memories from his past, from which his isolation on the island has enabled him to remain largely immune until now. Fredrik also seeks to address the regrets he has about the unfortunate incident which led to his enforced retirement Key themes of the novel concern the dilemmas faced by those experiencing aging and death, both at first hand and through others close to them; the impact of poverty and destitution on an individual's life chances; and vulnerability, courage and forgiveness in intimate relationships. Film Kenneth Branagh, who portrays Kurt Wallander in the BBC adaption, will direct and produce an upcoming film based on Italian Shoes. The film will probably star Anthony Hopkins as Fredrik Welin. Filming will most likely start in the fall of 2011, after a possible third season of Wallander has wrapped up.http://www.ystadsallehanda.se/kultur- och-noje/article1370963/Branagh-och-Hopkins-i-ny-Mankell-film.html ReferencesExternal links * Official Henning Mankell website Category:2006 Swedish novels Category:Novels by Henning Mankell Category:Fiction set in 2004 Category:Novels set in Sweden ","title":"Italian Shoes"},{"id":"26978749","text":"Lockheed EP-3E ARIES II in 2006 The Lockheed P-3 Orion maritime surveillance aircraft underwent a number of variants and specific unique design elements. The following is an extensive catalogue of each variant and/or design stage of the aircraft. For a broader article on the history of the P-3, see Lockheed P-3 Orion. P-3A and variants A P-3A from VP-49 wearing the original blue/white scheme, in 1964 *P-3A: The original production version; 157 built. *P-3A (CS): Four P-3A aircraft were reequipped with AN/APG-66 radars for use by U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Office of Air and Marine. *EP-3A: Seven modified for electronic reconnaissance testing. *NP-3A: Three modified for the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. *RP-3A: Two modified for scientific uses for the former Oceanographic Development Squadron EIGHT (VXN-8) at NAS Patuxent River. *TP-3A: 12 modified for training duties in Fleet Replacement Squadrons with all ASW gear removed. *UP-3A: 38 reconfigured as utility transports with all the ASW gear removed. *VP-3A: Three WP-3A and two P-3A aircraft converted into VIP/staff transports. *WP-3A: Four converted for weather reconnaissance. P-3B and variants A P-3B from VP-17 off Oahu, in 1976. *P-3B: Second main production version/series T56-A14 engines in lieu of T56-A10W engines on P-3A. *P-3AM: Modification to P-3B model for the Brazilian Air Force. Twelve aircraft with EADS/CASA avionics, with deliveries to the Brazilian AF beginning on 3 December 2010.Designation as reported by Asas magazine No. 59, S√£o Paulo, Brazil, March 2011, p. 22. Previously reported by this page as a variant of P-3A called P-3BR, but the magazine reports the variant and the aircraft quantity and confirms the EADS/CASA refit. *EP-3B: Three P-3As were obtained by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from the United States Navy (USN) under Project STSPIN in May 1963, as the replacement aircraft for the CIA's own covert-operations fleet of RB-69As and P2V-7Us. Converted by Aerosystems Division of LTV at Greenville, Texas, the three P-3As were simply known as \\"black\\" P-3A under Project Axial. Officially transferred from the USN to the CIA on June/July 1964, LTV Aerosystems converted the three aircraft to be both ELINT and COMINT platforms. The first arrived in Taiwan and was officially transferred to the Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) top secret \\"Black Bat\\" Squadron on 22 June 1966. Armed with four AIM-9 Sidewinder short range AAM missiles for self-defense, the three \\"black\\" P-3As flew peripheral missions along the China coast to collect SIGINT and air samples. When the project was terminated in January 1967, they were flown to NAS Alameda, California, for long term storage. Two of the three aircraft were converted as the only EP-3B examples by Lockheed at Burbank in September 1967, while the third aircraft was converted by Lockheed in 1969‚Äì1970 to serve as a development aircraft for various electronic programs. The two EP-3Bs were known as \\"Bat Rack\\", owing to their short period of service with Taiwan's \\"Black Bat\\" Squadron, and were issued to the USN's VQ-1 Squadron in 1969 and deployed to Da Nang Air Base, Vietnam. Later, the two EP-3Bs were converted to EP-3E ARIES, along with ten EP-3As. The twelve EP-3Es were retired in the 1980s, when replaced by an equivalent number of EP-3E ARIES II aircraft.Pocock, Chris. The Black Bats: CIA Spy Flights Over China From Taiwan, 1951 ‚Äì 1969. Atglen, Pennsylvania: Schiffer Publishing, 2010. . *NP-3B: One P-3B converted into a testbed, for the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. P-3C and variants A VP-8 P-3C shadowing a Soviet Victor-class submarine, 1985. * P-3C: Third main production version/series. T56-A14 engines. The P-3C had A-NEW ASW suite and mission computer with a revised internal layout. Externally the P-3C featured electrically operated entry ladder; small fin-top antenna; externally loaded belly sonobuoy chutes; and three small windows on the aft right side (one window forward of the overwing emergency exit and two well aft). Initial production aircraft had a camera nose located on the lower part of the radome. Later production aircraft had retractable an IRDS turret in lieu of the nose camera. Beginning in the early 1980s existing camera noses were retrofitted with IRDS turrets. Early models were also known as P-3C \\"Baseline\\" or Non-Update (NUD) aircraft. All aircraft were later retrofitted with dual LTN-72 inertial navigation systems. **P-3C Update I: New and improved avionics, 31 built. **P-3C Update II: With infra- red detection system (IRDS), sonobuoy reference system (SRS), and ability to carry the AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile; 44 built. **P-3C Update II.5: 24 aircraft with more reliable LTN-72 inertial navigation system and enhanced communications equipment. **P-3C Update III: 50 new-build aircraft incorporating systems of Update II and Update II.5 with new acoustic processor, sonobuoy receiver, plasma displays, OMEGA navigation and improved auxiliary power unit (APU). **P-3C SUDS {Sensor Update System} (US): retrofit of selected NUD, UDI, UDII an UDIII aircraft to UDIII acoustic processor and other avionics standard; NUD and UDI aircraft modified under SUDS were not retrofitted with SRS **P-3C Update IV: P-3C with Boeing Update 4 avionics suite. Update 4 was intended to be the common avionics suite for the P-3C aircraft and its planned replacement, the Lockheed P-7, which never made it to production.

In 1973, the RP-3D was instrumental in pinpointing the wreckage of Civil War ironclad USS Monitor. WP-3D NOAA WP-3D Hurricane Hunters The Lockheed WP-3D Orion is a production line variant of the P-3 Orion used by the Aircraft Operations Center division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) at MacDill AFB, Florida. Only two of these craft exist, each incorporating numerous features for the role of collecting weather information. During hurricane season, the WP-3Ds are deployed for duty as hurricane hunters. EP-3E Aries & Aries II 10 P-3A and 2 EP-3B aircraft converted into ELINT aircraft. The EP-3E Aries II are 12 P-3C aircraft converted into ELINT aircraft. EP-3E SIGINT Eight US Navy EP-3E aircraft are to be converted by L-3 Communications Integrated Systems into \\"surge configuration\\" Signals Intelligence aircraft. This will expand their multi-source intelligence capacity to meet the increased intelligence demands of the \\"surge\\" in counter-terrorism operations.Jane's Defence Weekly 14 January 2009 NP-3E Various aircraft used for tests. P-3F A Lockheed P-3F Orion of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (s/n 5-8703), at Shiraz Int'l Airport in 2007. Six P-3F Orions delivered to the former Imperial Iranian Air Force in the late 1970s. The airframe of the P-3F was based on the P-3C, which was the then-current production variant of the P-3 for the USN. Unlike production model P-3Cs and CP-140/140As, the P-3F lacked the small fin-top UHF antenna. The P-3F did not have the ASW suite or mission computer of the P-3C and most of the displays and processors were adapted from the older P-3A and P-3B (although the P-3F had the APS-115 radar of the P-3C). The P-3Fs came from the factory with the then-standard gray and white U.S Navy paint scheme, but while crews were undergoing training in the US, the aircraft were repainted in a unique three-tone blue paint scheme. Three aircraft are still operational with the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF). P-3G Original designation of the proposed Lockheed P-7A. P-3H Proposed P-3C upgrade. EP-3J Two P-3A aircraft modified for FEWSG use as a simulated adversary EW platform in exercises; later transferred from FEWSG to the former Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron Thirty-Three (VAQ-33) at NAS Key West, Florida, providing adversary electronic warfare services for Fleet training. Upon disbandment of VAQ-33, the aircraft were transferred to Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron Eleven (VQ-11) of the Navy Reserve at NAS Brunswick, Maine, continuing the previous role of VAQ-33. The aircraft were retired at the disbandment of VQ-11 as part of a post-Cold War force reduction of the Naval Air Reserve. P-3K & P-3K2 Five aircraft originally of P-3B standard but subsequently updated, delivered to New Zealand in 1965‚Äì67, replacing Short Sunderlands. The original P-3B aircraft were operated by No. 5 Squadron RNZAF from Whenuapai, Auckland. These received part of the P-3C Update II package and some local innovations, then being designated P-3K (for Kiwi), together with a P-3B purchased second hand from the Royal Australian Air Force and brought up to P-3K standard. P-3K2: Upgraded P-3K, all 6 aircraft were re-winged and underwent a further round of avionics and sensor updates in 2005.RNZAF P-3K2 Update P-3M Five former Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF) P-3B modernized by EADS-CASA for the Spanish AF. They have a new sensor suite integrated by a six console EADS-CASA Fully Integrated Tactical System (FITS)data system. New sensors include an Elta-2022 radar, SPAS-16 acoustic processor, new 99-channel sonobuoy receiver and AMES-C ESM system. Only the original MAD system was kept. P-3N Two P-3B modified for coast guard missions for the RNoAF. P-3P Six ex-Royal Australian Air Force aircraft originally of P-3B standard but subsequently updated for the Portuguese Air Force. Being replaced by newer P-3C Update II.5s (P-3C CUP) formerly operated by the Royal Netherlands Navy. P-3T & VP-3T The P-3T consists of two former USN P-3As modified for the Royal Thai Navy. The VP-3T is a single former USN P-3A modified for Royal Thai Navy VIP use and some surveillance operations. P-3W Designation used internally by the RAAF to distinguish the first 10 P-3C aircraft procured in the P-3C Update 2 configuration (1978‚Äì79) from the second 10 aircraft which were procured in the Update 2.5 configuration (1982‚Äì83). The older aircraft were designated as P-3C and the newer aircraft P-3W. All were equipped with the British AQS-901 Acoustics Processor. Eventually with various system upgrades to the mission systems the two types merged into one and they are now all known as AP-3C. AP-3C & TAP-3C The underbelly of an AP-3C The Lockheed AP-3C Orion is a variant of the P-3 Orion used by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) for tasks such as naval fleet support, maritime surveillance, search and survivor supply and anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare. They are fitted with a variety of sensors. They include digital multi-mode radar, electronic support measures, electro-optics detectors (infra-red and visual), magnetic anomaly detectors, identification friend or foe systems, and acoustic detectors. The 18 AP-3C Orions were upgraded from P-3Cs between 1997 and 2005, with the program taking three years longer than expected due to systems integration problems. All 18 AP-3C Orions are operated by No. 92 Wing which is based at RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia. Aircraft from the wing have seen service as part of Australian Defence Force operations in Australia, South East Asia and the Middle East. All Royal Australian Air Force P-3C/W aircraft which have been fully upgraded with totally new mission systems by L-3 Communications to include an Elta SAR/ISAR RADAR and a GD-Canada Acoustic Processor system. The TAP-3 is 3 modified B-models for training duties with the Royal Australian Air Force, with all the ASW gear removed and passenger seating installed. Removed from service with the full introduction into service of the AP-3C Simulator. Designator reflected them as being 'Training Australian P-3' Five AP-3Cs were purchased by MHD-ROCKLAND in 2018. The aircraft are on the US FAA registry as type 285D, and are based in Keystone Heights, FL. P-3CK Designation of the eight former USN P-3B TACNAVMOD aircraft that the Republic of Korea Navy procured from the USN and which are in the process of being rebuilt with P-3C configuration wings and fitted with updated Mission System Equipment by Korea Aerospace Industries and L-3 Communications. These use the Vpx ENhanced Open architecture Multi- static(VENOM) acoustic processor system instead of the AN/USQ-78B installed in the aircraft of the United States and trusted allies. P-3AEW&C; U.S. Department of Homeland Security P-3AEW&C; to track drug couriers Originally nicknamed \\"Sentinel\\". Eight P-3B aircraft were converted into Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft. In the early 90s, \\"Control\\" was dropped from the official designation along with the corresponding \\"C\\", renaming the model \\"P-3-AEW\\". This made it more easily differentiated from the E-3-AWACS operated by the U.S.Air Force. The P-3-AEWs are used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Air and Marine Operations for drug interdiction and homeland security missions. \\"P-3-LRT\\" (Long Range Tracker), previously known as \\"Slicks\\", also operated by CBP, are modified P-3 aircraft with an optical sensor turret in the nose and tracking radar which often work with the AEW ships. The mission using both types of aircraft in a single mission is called \\"Double Eagle\\". CP-140 Aurora & CP-140A Arcturus Canadian CP-140 Aurora in June 2007 The Lockheed CP-140 Aurora is a Royal Canadian Air Force maritime patrol aircraft (MPA). The aircraft is based on the P-3 Orion airframe, but mounts the electronics suite of the Lockheed S-3 Viking. In Greek mythology, Aurora is the Greek goddess who restored Orion's eyesight, and the Aurora Borealis are the \\"northern lights\\" that are prominent over northern Canada and the Arctic Ocean. Eighteen were built. The CP-140A Arcturus is a related variant used primarily for pilot training and coastal surface patrol missions. It is not equipped with ASW equipment. Three were built. P-7 The Lockheed P-7 was a four turboprop-engined patrol aircraft ordered by the US Navy as a replacement for the P-3 Orion. The external configuration of the aircraft was to be very similar to that of the P-3. Development had not progressed very much before the program was cancelled in the early 1990s, as a cost-cutting measure following the end of the Cold War. Orion 21 Proposed new-build and improved variant as a P-3 Orion replacement; lost to the Boeing P-8 Poseidon.

Others are due to changes in the game over time, shifts of focus one way or another over a generation or decades in some cases and much shorter spans in others, which make it seem unlikely the marks will be broken when viewed through today's lenses. Outliers, however, can appear at any time, and do, accounting for many previously regarded as \\"unbeatable\\" records being broken ‚Äì and in some cases re-broken. Pitching Cy Young's record 511 career wins and 749 complete games have never been approached since he retired in 1911.  Most career wins ‚Äì 511  Set by Cy Young, 1890‚Äì1911. Highlights include five 30-win seasons and fifteen 20-win seasons. The next closest player is Walter Johnson with 417; he is the only other player to have reached 400. The most wins by a pitcher who played his entire career in the post-1920 live-ball era is Warren Spahn's 363. For a player to accomplish this, he would have to average 25 wins in 20 seasons just to get to 500. Since 1978, only 3 pitchers (Ron Guidry in 1978, Bob Welch in 1990, and Steve Stone in 1980) have had one season with 25 wins. Between 2000 and 2009, the Major League leader finished each year with an average of 21. Only two players expected to be active in the 2020 season have even 200 wins, both of whom were born in 1983‚ÄîJustin Verlander with 225 and Zack Greinke with 205.  Most wins in a season ‚Äì 59  Set by Charles Radbourn, in 1884, with Jack Chesbro's 41 in 1904 historically regarded as the modern mark. Most pitchers in today's game of five-man rotations start fewer than 35 games per season, and thus do not start enough games to break the record. The most games started by a pitcher in the 2019 season was 34, accomplished by seven pitchers, and only three pitchers in the 21st century have started more than 35 games in a season (Tom Glavine in 2002 and Roy Halladay and Greg Maddux in 2003, each with 36 starts). Although relief pitchers often appear in more than the requisite number of games, they rarely record ten wins in a season. However, the use of relief pitchers increases a starter's chance of a no decision, further limiting the ability to break the record. To put this record in further perspective, the last pitcher to win 30 games in a season was Denny McLain in 1968 and the last pitcher to win 25 games in a season was Bob Welch in 1990. Also, the most wins in a season by any pitcher in the 21st century is 24, by Randy Johnson in 2002 and Justin Verlander in 2011.  Most career complete games ‚Äì 749  Set by Cy Young, 1890‚Äì1911. Highlights of this record include: nine 40-complete-game seasons, eighteen 30-complete-game seasons and completing 92 percent of his total career starts (an all-time record of 815). The next closest player is Pud Galvin, who has 103 fewer complete games at 646. Among pitchers whose entire careers were in the live-ball era, the most is 382 by Warren Spahn. For a player to accomplish this, he would have to average 30 complete games over 25 seasons to get to 750. Between 2000 and 2009, the Major League leaders in complete games averaged eight per season, and only two pitchers in the 21st century have had 10 complete games in any season (CC Sabathia with 10 in 2008 and James Shields with 11 in 2011). In addition, only two pitchers other than Young have even started as many as 749 games‚ÄîNolan Ryan (773) and Don Sutton (756). Among pitchers expected to be active in the 2020 season, Justin Verlander has the most complete games with 26, and only four others have 20 or more. The quest for any complete-game records, either over a career or over a single season, is further complicated by the drastic change in philosophy embraced by virtually all modern managers and pitching coaches, motivated in roughly equal parts by more advanced modern-day medical knowledge of the cumulative damage that pitching does to a hurler's arm, combined with a team front office's reluctance to see a pitcher in whom they have invested considerable financial capital in the form of a big contract getting hurt. Another factor, arguably, is the greater reliance of managers and pitching coaches on sabermetrics‚Äîin this case, statistical data and analysis that generally show leaving a starter in longer leads to diminishing returns in terms of opposing batters allowed to reach base safely and score runs. While even a few decades ago, a starting pitcher was expected to go out and attempt to pitch a complete game, with the manager going to his bullpen only if the starter ran into trouble or was injured or visibly tiring, the present-day norm is the starter is expected to give his manager six, or perhaps seven \\"quality innings,\\" at which point the manager‚Äîwho, along with the pitching coach, has been tracking the starter's pitch count‚Äîwill normally lift him and bring in one or more middle-relief specialists to pitch the next several innings and form a bridge to the team's closer. There are exceptions‚Äîa manager will leave a starter in who is working on a no-hitter or, sometimes, a shutout, or will let a starter continue if he is pitching particularly strongly and has not run up a high pitch count. But managerial caution is now a more dominant mode, particularly if a pitcher is coming off a recent injury or has had Tommy John surgery or any other major procedure done on his pitching arm. These changes in philosophy have reduced the number of complete games in today's game to an even greater extent than in the first decade of the 21st century. Since Shields amassed 11 complete games in 2011, no pitcher has had more than 6 complete games in a season. In 2018, all of Major League Baseball combined for 42 complete games, with no pitcher having more than 2. The 2019 season was similar in both respects, with 45 total complete games and no pitcher having more than 3. In a 2019 story, Sam Miller of ESPN went so far as to say, \\"In your lifetime, you might very well see the last complete game.\\"  Most complete games in a season ‚Äì 75  All-time record of 75 set by Will White in 1879; modern-era record of 48 set by Jack Chesbro in 1904. Sports Illustrated has said about this record, \\"Even if the bar is lowered to begin with the live-ball era (which began in 1920), the mark would still be untouchable.\\" The most complete games recorded in a live-ball season is 33, achieved three times in all‚Äîtwice at the dawn of that era by Grover Cleveland Alexander in 1920 and Burleigh Grimes in 1923, and also by Dizzy Trout in 1944, a season in which the player pool was severely depleted by military call-ups during World War II. Modern starters can expect to start about 34 games in a season. Most consecutive complete games in a season (since 1900) ‚Äì 39; Most consecutive games without being relieved ‚Äì 202 Both records were set by Jack Taylor, who pitched 202 consecutive games without being relieved from June 20, 1901 through August 13, 1906. The streak includes a total of 187 career starts (all complete games) and 15 relief appearances. The streak of 39 consecutive complete games (uninterrupted by a relief appearance) is a subset of the longer streak, lasting from April 15 through October 6, 1904.  Most career shutouts ‚Äì 110  Walter Johnson's 110 career shutouts are 47 ahead of anyone who has played since 1965. Set by Walter Johnson, 1907‚Äì27. Highlights include: eleven 6-shutout seasons and leading the league in shutouts 7 times. The next closest player is Grover Cleveland Alexander, who has 90. As is the case for career wins and complete games, Warren Spahn, who retired in 1965, holds the record among pitchers whose entire careers were in the live-ball era, with 63. For a player to tie Johnson's record, he would have to pitch 5 shutouts every season for 22 years. Between 2010 and 2019, the Major League leader in shutouts finished each year with an average of 3, and no pitcher has recorded more than 2 shutouts in a season since 2017. Also, adding the MLB- leading shutout totals for each season from 1992 through 2019 results in a total of 106, still short of Johnson's record. The closest active player is Clayton Kershaw with 15.  Most shutouts in a season ‚Äì 16  Set first by George Bradley in 1876 and equaled by Grover Cleveland Alexander in 1916; live-ball era record of 13 set by Bob Gibson in 1968. The aforementioned Sam Miller had this to say about a rhetorical suggestion that the live-ball record of 13 could be broken: \\"This is the stupidest suggestion yet. Thirteen shutouts clearly belongs in the anachronism pile.\\" He pointed out that neither the National nor American League had 13 combined shutouts in the 2018 season, and no pitcher had more than one in that season.  Most consecutive no- hitters ‚Äì 2  Set by Johnny Vander Meer on June 11 and 15, 1938. Despite holding this record, he finished his career with a 119‚Äì121 win‚Äìloss record. The prospect of a pitcher breaking this record by hurling three no-hitters in a row is so unimaginable that LIFE argued \\"it's easier to imagine someone hitting in 57 straight games or bashing 74 home runs in a season or ending the season with a 1.11 ERA.\\" Ewell Blackwell came the closest to matching Vander Meer after following up a no-hitter with eight no-hit innings in 1947. In 1988, Dave Stieb of the Toronto Blue Jays had consecutive no-hitters going with two outs in the ninth; both were broken up by singles. Between 2010 and 2019, 35 no-hitters were pitched (not including five combined no-hitters involving multiple pitchers), and the closest anyone came in the 21st century is Max Scherzer, who in 2015 threw a one-hitter and no-hitter in consecutive starts, respectively losing out on perfect games in the seventh inning and on the 27th batter. Nolan Ryan was a dominating power pitcher who holds career records in strikeouts, no-hitters, and bases on balls ‚Äì all by large margins. His record 27 years on the mound also may be safe.  Most career no-hitters ‚Äì 7  Set by Nolan Ryan, 1966‚Äì93. Sandy Koufax is second with four. Larry Corcoran, Cy Young, Bob Feller, and Justin Verlander have all thrown three. Only Verlander is active. In all, 26 pitchers have thrown two, including active players Homer Bailey, Max Scherzer, Mike Fiers, and Jake Arrieta. An additional 16 active pitchers have thrown one. Between 2000 and 2009, 20 no- hitters in all were thrown‚Äî19 of them solo no-hitters and one a combined no- hitter (in which more than one pitcher contributed). The following decade (2010‚Äì2019) saw the number of no-hitters double from the 2000s, with 40 (36 solo, 4 combined).  Most career strikeouts ‚Äì 5,714  Set by Nolan Ryan, 1966‚Äì93. Highlights include: six 300-strikeout seasons, fifteen 200-strikeout seasons, and leading the league in strikeouts 11 times. To accomplish this record, Ryan played the most seasons (27) in MLB history. The next closest player is Randy Johnson, who has 839 fewer strikeouts at 4,875. Johnson also had four consecutive 300-strikeout seasons at the turn of the 21st century (1999‚Äì2002); the only pitchers with a 300-strikeout season after 2002 are Clayton Kershaw, who had 301 in 2015; Chris Sale, with 308 in 2017; Max Scherzer, with 300 in 2018; and Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander, respectively with 326 and 300 in 2019. For a player to approach this record, he would have to average 225 strikeouts over 25 seasons just to get to 5,625. Averaging 250 strikeouts over 23 seasons would enable him to surpass the record with 5,750. Between 2010 and 2019 the Major League leader in strikeouts finished each year with an average of 279, and even that average is skewed with the aforementioned large strikeout seasons late in the decade. No pitcher exceeded 280 strikeouts between 2005 and 2014. Since then, only seven 280-strikeout seasons have been recorded‚Äîthe five aforementioned 300-strikeout performances, plus Scherzer's 284 in 2016 and Verlander's 290 in 2018. With CC Sabathia having retired at the end of the 2019 season with 3,093 strikeouts, the closest active player is now Verlander, with 3,006 strikeouts.  Most career bases on balls ‚Äì 2,795  Set by Nolan Ryan, 1966‚Äì93. Ryan has more than 50 percent more bases on balls than the next highest (Steve Carlton with 1833). No pitcher expected to be active in the 2020 season has issued even 900 career walks; the active leader, Justin Verlander, ended the 2019 season with 850.  Most career saves ‚Äì 652  Mariano Rivera holds the all-time save record.Yankees' Mariano Rivera 1st Player Unanimously Voted into Baseball Hall of Fame The current save record of 652 was set by Mariano Rivera, 1995‚Äì2013, who eclipsed Trevor Hoffman's 601 earned 1993‚Äì2010. Highlights of Rivera's career include 15 consecutive seasons with 25 or more saves, 9 consecutive seasons with 30 or more saves and 15 seasons with 30 or more saves (all three are records). After Hoffman the next-closest pitcher in saves is Lee Smith, with 478. For a player to reach Rivera's record, he would have to earn an average of 35 saves for 17 consecutive seasons just to get to 595 saves or 40 saves for 16 consecutive years to reach 640. As of the end of the 2019 season, the closest active player is -year-old Craig Kimbrel with 346 saves, slightly more than half of Rivera's total.  Most innings pitched in a season ‚Äì 680  Set by Will White in the same 1879 season in which he set the record of 75 complete games noted above (at this time the distance from mound to plate was 45 feet). The record pitching from the distance used since 1893 (60 feet 6 inches) is 482 innings that first year by Amos Rusie, which had been exceeded 85 times by pitchers working from 45 or (starting in 1881) 50 feet, including by Rusie himself the three previous consecutive seasons, but has never been approached since (Ed Walsh in 1908 was the last to pitch 400 innings in a season). The most innings pitched in a live-ball season (since 1920) was Wilbur Wood's 3762‚ÅÑ3 innings in 1972. No pitcher has even thrown half of White's record total for innings in a season since Phil Niekro in 1979, with 342. The last 300-inning season to date was by Steve Carlton the following year, with 304. The highest single-season innings count in the 21st century was Roy Halladay's 266 in 2003, and the three most recent seasons of 2017, 2018, and 2019 saw the three lowest innings totals for an MLB leader in the sport's history (apart from the strike-shortened 1981 and 1994 seasons)‚ÄîChris Sale with 2141‚ÅÑ3 in 2017, Max Scherzer with 2202‚ÅÑ3 in 2018, and Justin Verlander with 223 in 2019.  Most career wild pitches thrown ‚Äì 343  Set by Tony Mullane, whose career spanned from 1881 to 1894. Mullane pitched through a staggering 4531.1 innings (24th all-time) throwing a total of 343 wild pitches and averaged an errant pitch in 7.56% of those innings. Nolan Ryan is second on the list of most wild pitches with 277. The active leader in wild pitches is F√©lix Hern√°ndez with 156, less than half of Mullane's total. With modern pitchers throwing fewer innings as well as wild pitches, this record is safely unbreakable.  Batting  Pete Rose topped 200 hits 10 times and averaged nearly 180 a season over his 24-year career to amass a record 4,256 hits  Most career MLB hits ‚Äì 4,256  Set by Pete Rose, 1963‚Äì86. No active major league player is at this time considered to be close to breaking Rose's mark. The only active player with 3,000 hits is the 39-year-old Albert Pujols (3,202). To get within 6 hits of tying Rose, a player would have to collect 250 hits for 17 straight seasons, or more than 200 hits over the course of 21 seasons. In the past 81 years, only Ichiro Suzuki, whose first season in Major League Baseball was his tenth in the top professional ranks, following nine years in his native Japan, has topped 250 hits in a season (with 262 hits in 2004). Ichiro ended his playing career with 3,089 MLB hits and 1,278 hits in the Japanese major leagues (averaging just 106 games and 142 hits a year in much shorter Japanese seasons) for a combined, unofficial total of 4,367, 111 more than Rose's record; however, Ichiro's hits from Japan's major leagues are not counted toward his MLB total. At the end of the 2019 season, Miguel Cabrera ( years old) had 2,815 hits after 17 seasons; he would have to average 181 hits over 8 additional seasons (or 207 over 7 seasons) to break the record. No player younger than Cabrera was within 200 hits of his career total at the end of the 2019 season, and among players younger than 30 at that time, only Starlin Castro had even 1,600 career hits (1,617). Most hits in a season ‚Äì 262 Ichiro Suzuki only began his Major League career at 27 after nine record-setting seasons in Japan. He holds the mark for most hits in a season (262) and may well have set it for most career hits had he played entirely in MLB. Set by Ichiro Suzuki in 2004, breaking a record that had been set in 1920 by George Sisler (257), this record is only fifteen seasons old and thus its longterm durability is debatable. Changes to the game and how it is broadly approached have an effect on any record's longevity. Writing shortly before Ichiro retired, the aforementioned Miller noted that the only active player who had collected more than 225 hits in any season was Ichiro himself, who exceeded that total three times in all. The next highest total since 2000 was 240 hits, batted by Darin Erstad in the 2000 season. Miller added that in today's game, \\"few elite hitters are as walk-averse as Ichiro was permitted to be\\", which he argued was a necessity for a player to be able to approach the record. The MLB leader in at-bats in 2018 was Trea Turner with 664; a player with that number of at-bats would have to hit .396 to reach 263 hits‚Äîa batting average that Miller himself had argued in 2018 was unapproachable in the modern game. He added, > The outer limit for at-bats ‚Äì say, a leadoff hitter for a high-scoring team > who plays every game and has a 10th-percentile walk rate ‚Äì is perhaps 725, > nine higher than the all-time record. And even the 725-AB guy would need to > hit .363, a mark not met by any hitter in this decade.  Most consecutive seasons with 200 hits ‚Äì 10  Set by Ichiro Suzuki, who attained this from 2001‚Äì10. Ichiro's honors since joining the Seattle Mariners from Nippon Professional Baseball at age 27 include winning the 2001 AL Rookie of the Year and MVP awards, claiming the AL batting title in 2001 and 2004, leading the AL in hits in seven seasons (2001, 2004, 2006‚Äì10) and breaking George Sisler's 84-year-old single-season hits record in 2004 with 262 hits. The closest player is Willie Keeler who had 8 consecutive seasons with 200 hits that occurred almost a century prior in the dead-ball era.Baseball's Top 100: The Game's Greatest Records, p.46, Kerry Banks, 2010, Greystone Books, Vancouver, BC, The 2018 season was the first since 2013 in which no player reached the 200-hit mark; only Whit Merrifield and Rafael Devers reached that mark in 2019.  Most career triples ‚Äì 309  Set by Sam Crawford, 1899‚Äì1916. Highlights include: five 20-triple seasons and sixteen 10-triple seasons. The next closest player is Ty Cobb, who has 14 fewer triples at 295. Because of changes in playing styles and ballparks that began around 1920 and have continued into the present from the dead-ball era to the live-ball era, the number of triples hit has declined noticeably since then. Among hitters whose entire careers were in the live-ball era, the leader in career triples is Stan Musial, with 177. For a player to threaten Crawford's record, he would have to average 15 triples over 20 seasons just to get to 300. Between 2010 and 2019 the Major League leader in triples finished each year with an average of 13, and no player in that decade had more than 16 in a season. The closest active player is Dexter Fowler with 82.  Most triples in a season ‚Äì 36  Set by Chief Wilson in 1912. Only two other players have ever had 30 triples in a season (Dave Orr with 31 in 1886 and Heinie Reitz with 31 in 1894), while the closest anyone has come in the century since Wilson set the record is 26, shared by Sam Crawford (1914) and Kiki Cuyler (1925). Only six hitters have had 20 triples in the last 50 years: George Brett (20 in 1979), Willie Wilson (21 in 1985), Lance Johnson (21 in 1996), Cristian Guzm√°n (20 in 2000), Curtis Granderson (23 in 2007) and Jimmy Rollins (20 in 2007). The aforementioned Sam Miller also added that Chief Wilson was playing his home games in Forbes Field, which in 1912 had a 460-foot center-field distance, noticeably longer than any current MLB park. In his record-setting season, Wilson hit 24 triples at home, a total that has not been surpassed in an entire season since 1925. Additionally, Wilson himself never hit more than 14 triples in any other season. On top of this, no minor-league player has ever had more than 31 triples in a season, despite that level of the game having less capable defenders, many quirky ballparks (more so in past decades than today), and in some historical cases much longer seasons.  Most home runs in a game ‚Äì 4  Lou Gehrig was a prolific home run hitter who retired in 1939 with the second-most in a career, behind only retired teammate Babe Ruth In all, 18 players have hit four home runs in a game. A five-homer game would require not only that a player get five plate appearances in a game, but that he receive hittable pitches in each appearance. Only two players, who have hit four in one game, have ever made a plate appearance that could have resulted in his fifth homer of a game‚ÄîLou Gehrig in 1932 and Mike Cameron in 2002. Both players had two plate appearances in a game after having hit four homers; in Gehrig's last at-bat he hit a deep fly to center. Additionally, no player has ever homered in five consecutive at-bats, even in multiple games. Breaking this record would also set the record for most total bases in 1 game, with 20. However, home runs are being hit at ever-increasing rates, reflecting a shift in the game towards batters focusing on \\"launch angles\\", dramatically reduced penalty for strikeouts, and a claim by some that MLB has allegedly \\"juiced\\" the ball. Justin Verlander blames MLB for juiced balls, home run spike: 'Major League Baseball's turning this game into a joke' These factors increase the prospect of a five-homer game, particularly over extra innings.  Most grand slams in a single inning ‚Äì 2  Set by Fernando Tat√≠s in 1999. Only twelve other players have ever hit two grand slams in a single game. However, breaking the record would require a player to hit three grand slams in a single inning. Breaking this record would also tie the major league record for RBI in a single game (12). Over 50 players have hit two home runs in a single inning, but no MLB player has so much as hit three home runs in one inning. However, one minor league player, Gene Rye, has achieved the feat of hitting three home runs in a single inning.  Highest career batting average ‚Äì .367  Ty Cobb topped .300 23 straight seasons, won 12 batting titles, and batted over .400 three times en route to an \\"unbreakable\\" career batting average of .367. Set by Ty Cobb in 1928 after beginning his career in 1905. Highlights of this record include; three .400 seasons, nine .380 seasons, and leading the league 11 times in batting average. Cobb managed to hit .323 in his final season at age 41. The next-closest player is Rogers Hornsby who had a batting average of .358. The careers of both Cobb and Hornsby straddled the dead-ball and live-ball eras; most of Cobb's career was in the dead-ball era, while most of Hornsby's was in the live-ball era. There are only three players with a career average over .350, and the highest batting average among those who played their entire careers in the live-ball era is Ted Williams' .344. Since 1928, there have been only 46 seasons in which a hitter reached .366 and only Tony Gwynn attained that mark at least four times, finishing with a career .338 batting average. At the end of the 2019 season, Miguel Cabrera leads active players in career batting average, fractionally above Jos√© Altuve (.3146 to .3145).  Highest single-season batting average ‚Äì .440 Set by Hugh Duffy in 1894, the highest single-season average in National League, and MLB history. Nap Lajoie's .426 in 1901 is the highest in American League history. In the modern (post-\\"dead-ball\\") era, Rogers Hornsby hit .424 in 1924, a feat unmatched since then. George Sisler's .420 average in 1922 still stands as the highest American League average of the modern era. Ted Williams hit .406 in 1941, the last player in either league to top .400 for a season. Since then, only George Brett, who hit .390 in 1980, and Tony Gwynn, who hit .394 in a strike-shortened season in 1994, have even come close to reaching .400, and they were nowhere near any of the historical league or MLB highs. In a 2018 ESPN story, the aforementioned Sam Miller argued that it was impossible to hit .400, or even seriously challenge the mark, in the modern game, noting that no hitter in the 21st century entered the second half of the season with an average above .380, and no batter since 2009 who qualified for his league's batting title had a .400 average at any point after May 25. Additionally, Miller argued that a player who might conceivably challenge .400 would have to combine a low strikeout rate, high home run rate, and high batting average on balls in play‚Äîa group of skills which largely do not complement one another.  Most RBI in a season ‚Äì 191  Set by Hack Wilson, who batted in 191 runs in 1930. Only Lou Gehrig and Hank Greenberg, at 184 and 183 RBI respectively, ever came close, and there have been no real challenges to the record for over 75 years. However, Sam Miller argued in 2019 that a serious challenge to Wilson's record, though highly unlikely, was less implausible than challenges to many of the other records listed here. He noted that in 1930, Wilson came to bat with 524 runners on base, drove in 22.7% of them, and hit 56 homers. Neither the number of base-runners nor the RBI percentage is within the top 60 seasons for those statistics in MLB history, with some seasons in the top 60 of both categories having been recorded in the 21st century, and he added \\"we've all seen players hit 56 home runs, even this decade.\\" However, with today's batters pursuing one of baseball's so-called \\"three true outcomes\\" ‚Äì a home run, walk, or strikeoutThree True Outcomes, Baseball-reference.com ‚Äì there is less likelihood of enough runners on base for such a season to produce anything like 191 RBI.  Highest career on-base percentage ‚Äì .482  Ted Williams topped a .400 on-base percentage 18 times in his 19 years, often by 100 points or more, including .553 en route to a .406 batting average in 1941, the last season ever over .400. Set by Ted Williams from 1939 to 1960. Williams, the last man to hit .400 in an MLB season (.406 in 1941), won six American League batting titles, two Triple Crowns, and two MVP awards. He ended his career with 521 home runs and a .344 career batting average. Williams achieved these numbers and honors despite missing nearly five full seasons to military service and injuries. The next-closest player in career OBP is Babe Ruth at .474. Since Williams' retirement, only four players have posted an OBP above .482 in a season, with Barry Bonds and Mickey Mantle the only ones to do so more than once. Bonds ended his career with an OBP of .444; the leader among active players is Joey Votto, at .421 after the 2019 season.  Most regular season games played, season ‚Äì 165  Maury Wills was the National League Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1962, stealing a new single- season topping 104 bases in those record 165 games to break the old modern mark of 96, set by Ty Cobb in 156 games in 1915. The record was set in 1962 by Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Maury Wills,Batting Leaderboards: Single-Season Leaders & Records for Games Played, baseball-reference.com who played in all of the team's 165 regular season games that year. Thanks to a best-of-three playoff between the Dodgers and San Francisco Giants, which ended the season tied for first place (back when league pennants were winner-take-all, with no annual end-of-season multi-tiered layers of playoffs, play-ins, and wild cards), both teams played 165 games. Because the play-off was to determine the regular season winner of the league championship, the games were counted as extensions of the regular season, and not the post-season, which at that time was composed solely of the World Series. Both the individual and team single- season games played records were set at the beginning of a seven-year span that began with the 1962 National League expansion to 162 games and ended after the 1968 season, when the NL replaced its traditional best-of-three tiebreakers with one-game playoffs. The 1962 season was the only occasion during those years in which a tie-breaker was needed. The American League has always used one-game playoffs. No team has played more than 163 regular season games in a season since 1962. While there have been a few occasions where a three-way tie was possible going into the last day of the season (which would result in a team playing 164 games), a three-way tie involving postseason berths has never occurred. From 1969 to 1993, it would have been impossible for any team to be involved in more than three one-game playoffs in a season, since only division champions qualified for the postseason and since there was never more than eight teams per division. As of the end of the 2018 season, there has yet to be an occasion in MLB history where five teams of one league have finished with identical records, which would have been the circumstance needed during this era for any team to play even three tie-breakers and thus match the 1962 record. Since the introduction of the wild card, it has been technically possible to play 166 regular season games, but is extremely unlikely. For a team to have an opportunity to play four tiebreaker games, it would have to be involved in a tie involving three or more teams for the division crown and a separate tie also involving three or more teams for the second wild card berth, meaning that the aforementioned-unprecedented circumstance at least five teams in two different divisions of the same league finishing with identical records would have to occur. A team in such a situation would then have to win the division \\"semi-final\\" tiebreaker, lose the division \\"final\\" and then win the wild card \\"semi-final\\" in order to play 166 regular season games. The 2018 season, which resulted in two two-way ties for division titles, was the first occasion where there were even multiple two-way ties for division titles ‚Äì the losers of the 2018 tiebreaker games (who did not themselves have identical records) subsequently played each other in the Wild Card Game, but that game is considered part of the postseason and not the regular season. Wills' individual record is statistically ever more unlikely to be broken because teams are increasingly inclined to rest even their best players, part of a new metric-based strategy known as \\"load management\\". On average only about three players in all of baseball appear in all 162 games of any given MLB season. This implies that even if a club somehow managed to play 166 regular season games, there is mathematically only about a ten percent chance a particular team will have a player who will have appeared in all 162 games pending tie-breakers. It is also possible for a player to accumulate more than 162 games played in a season by virtue of a mid-season trade. A swap between a team that has played more games and one which has played fewer can result in a schedule for the traded player to be greater than either individual teams'. Presently '70s-era speedster Frank Taveras holds the records for both most regularly scheduled MLB games played in a season and most games played for two teams in the same season, both 164, done in 1979.  Most consecutive games played ‚Äì 2,632  Set by Cal Ripken Jr., 1982‚Äì98. Lou Gehrig, whose record Ripken surpassed in 1995, had a consecutive games streak of 2,130 games, 502 fewer. Third on the all-time list is Everett Scott, whose streak of 1,307 consecutive games is less than half of Ripken's total. Only seven players have ever played more than 1,000 consecutive games. For a player to approach the milestone, he would have to play all 162 games in a season for 16 years just to get to 2,592 games. As stated by LIFE, \\"no one else has ever come close, and no one ever will.\\" It is important to note, however, that before Gehrig's record was broken by Ripken the \\"Iron Horse's\\" 1939 mark was considered unbreakable. In his 1988 edition of The Baseball Abstract, author Bill James offered a presciently contrarian view that \\"... Gehrig's record is vulnerable precisely because human characteristics such as determination and the ability to play with pain can be applied to breaking it ... I expect Gehrig's (2,130) record to be broken in my lifetime\\". At that time, Ripken was more than seven years away from the record. On average, over the preceding ten seasons from 2009 to 2018 only three players have played all 162 regularly-scheduled games in a particular season.  Longest hitting streak ‚Äì 56 games  Set by Joe DiMaggio, 1941. Highlights of his hitting streak include a .404 batting average and 91 hits. The next closest player is Willie Keeler, with 45 over two seasons in 1896‚Äì7. There have been only six 40-game hitting streaks, and only Pete Rose's 44 in 1978 since DiMaggio's. Since 1900, no player other than DiMaggio has ever hit safely in even 55 of 56 games, and no active players (as of 2019) have their two longest career hit streaks even add up to 56 games. On July 17, 1941, pitchers Al Smith and Jim Bagby of the Cleveland Indians held DiMaggio hitless. Two hard hit shots came close, but great defensive stops by third baseman Ken Keltner ended the streak. \\"Joltin' Joe\\" actually hit in 57 straight MLB games ‚Äì singling in the 1941 All-Star game held mid- streakNewsday, 20 fun facts about Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hit streak ‚Äì and 76 out of 77 regular season games, starting a 17-game streak the day after his 56-game one ended.Bleacher Report, Open Mic: Joe DiMaggio's 56-Game Hit Streak Is One Record That Will Go Untouched He also holds the second longest streak in minor league baseball history, 61 games, set in 1933. The improbability of DiMaggio's hit streak ever being broken has been attributed to the increased bullpen use, including specialist relievers.  Most career home runs by an American League pitcher ‚Äì 37  Set by Wes Ferrell, who hit 37 home runs while playing for the Indians, Red Sox, Senators and Yankees during the late 1920s and most of the 1930s (Ferrell hit one more HR while with the Braves in 1941, bringing his total to 38 ‚Äì 37 as a pitcher and one as a pinch-hitter ‚Äì the most for any MLB pitcher). With a total of 326 hits in 1,176 at-bats in his 17-year career, almost all of which occurred while he played in the AL, Ferrell hit .280 and had 208 RBIs,http://www.baseball- almanac.com/players/player.php?p=ferrewe01 and is considered one of baseball's best-hitting pitchers. Other American League pitchers with notable home-run totals include Bob Lemon, who hit 35 HR as a pitcher and two more as a pinch hitter during his 18-year career, all spent with the Indians; Red Ruffing, who had 34 home runs as a pitcher and two more as pinch-hitter over 22 seasons with the Red Sox, Yankees and White Sox; and Earl Wilson, who hit 35 home runs in an 11-year career ‚Äì 33 as a pitcher and two as a pinch-hitter ‚Äì all but one of them while with the Red Sox and Tigers, and the last as a Padre.http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=wilsoea01 With \\"good-hitting pitchers\\" the exception rather than the rule, the American League's adoption of the designated hitter rule in 1973 ‚Äì leading to the widespread substitution of the DH in the pitcher's traditional #9 slot in the batting order in all AL games and all interleague, All-Star and World Series games played in AL parks ‚Äì means that no American League pitcher will ever get enough at-bats to seriously challenge any of the above home run statistics, or any other game, seasonal or career hitting marks set by AL pitchers historically. However, the Los Angeles Angels' signing of Japanese player Shohei Ohtani, who notably plays as both a starting pitcher and a designated hitter, could mean that Ferrell's record could be broken (although Ohtani generally does not hit and pitch in the same game when playing in AL parks, so his home runs as a DH may not be considered as being hit \\"by a pitcher\\").  Most career sacrifice bunts ‚Äì 512  Set by Eddie Collins, who successfully laid down 512 sacrifice bunts over his 25-year career with the Philadelphia Athletics.http://www.baseball-almanac.com/hitting/hisachit1.shtml Second behind him is Jake Daubert with 392, more than 100 fewer than Collins. Since the turn of the 20th century, sacrifice bunts have continually fallen further out of favor: Moneyball by Michael Lewis, the famous sabermetrician's guide, went as far as to label the bunt as \\"evil\\". Modern baseball teams value minimizing outs rather than moving a base-runner over a single base position. At the end of the 2019 season, the active leader in career sacrifice bunts, Clayton Kershaw, had 108‚Äîwhich placed him in a tie for 334th on the all-time list.  Most stolen bases in a season ‚Äì 130  Rickey Henderson holds both the single season (130) and career stolen base records (1,406), both regarded as unlikely to be broken. Set by Rickey Henderson with 130 in 1982, a season in which he was caught stealing 42 times. No player in the 2018 season even attempted one-third of Henderson's total attempts in 1982, and in the 2017 season, no American League player attempted more than Henderson's 1982 caught- stealing total of 42. Additionally, while Billy Hamilton set a minor-league record with 155 steals in 2012, he has never stolen more than 60 in any season of his MLB career.  Most career stolen bases ‚Äì 1,406  Set by Rickey Henderson, 1979‚Äì2003. Highlights include: three 100-stolen-base seasons, thirteen 50-stolen-base seasons, and leading the league in stolen bases 12 times. The next closest player is Lou Brock, who has 468 fewer stolen bases at 938. According to LIFE, the stolen base record is probably unbreakable, as it is hard to imagine a player today who would \\"even attempt so many steals.\\" For a player to approach Henderson's milestone, he would have to average 70 stolen bases over 20 seasons just to get to 1,400. Between 2000 and 2009, the Major League leader in stolen bases finished each year with an average of 64, and that number dropped to 57 in the 2010s‚Äîa decade in which no player stole 70 bases in a season. The closest active player is Rajai Davis with 415 stolen bases.  Fielding = Most outfield assists in a season ‚Äì 50  Phillie right-fielder Chuck Klein posted 44 assists in 1930 in Philadelphia's highly asymmetrical Baker BowlChuck Klein, Baseball-reference.com Set by Orator Shafer in 1879. Since 1900, no other player has had more than Chuck Klein's 44 in 1930, and nobody has had more than Boston Brave right-fielder Gene Moore's 32 since 1936.  Most outfield assists, career ‚Äì 449  Set by Hall of Famer Tris Speaker (1907‚Äì28).Career outfield assist leaders, Baseball- reference.com Speaker is regarded as the greatest fielding centerfielder ever, known for playing exceptionally shallow and going back on balls rather than coming in. Playing shallow in his era both erased a lot of hits and led to high assist totals ‚Äì fourteen seasons over 20 and four over 35. The closest anyone's come in nearly half a century is Roberto Clemente's (1955‚Äì1973) 266.  Other = Most All-Star Games played ‚Äì 25  Hank Aaron's mark of 25 career All-Star games is highly unlikely to be matched, let alone broken. Set by Hank Aaron, 1954‚Äì76. Aaron was an All-Star in all but two of the 23 seasons he played in the major leagues (his debut year in 1954 and last season in 1976). His record total was assisted by MLB's decision to hold two All-Star Games annually from 1959 to 1962; Aaron played in all eight All-Star Games during that period. The only players whose careers began after 1976 to play in 25 MLB seasons were Rickey Henderson, who appeared in 10 All-Star Games, and Jamie Moyer, who appeared in one. The active player with the most All-Star Game selections is Miguel Cabrera, who has been on 11 All-Star Game rosters after 17 seasons.  Most wins, losses and games managed ‚Äì 3,731, 3,948, and 7,755  Set by Connie Mack, who retired in 1950. Mack owned the Philadelphia Athletics, and managed them for 50 years, until the age of 87. Shortly after his retirement Major League Baseball forbade owners from managing their teams. Mack also was the manager in 76 ties as he managed in an era where games could be called due to darkness or local curfews.https://www.baseball- reference.com/managers/mackco01.shtml As ties no longer are possible as a result of rules changes, this record is unbreakable given the current rules. The closest manager to Mack in games managed and losses is Tony La Russa (5,097 games, 2,365 losses), with John McGraw second in wins (2,763). With the retirement of Bruce Bochy at the end of the 2019 season, who had led then- active managers with 2,003 wins (11th), 2,029 losses (5th), and 4,032 games managed (7th), the closest manager in games, wins, and losses is the -year-old Terry Francona (3,076 games, 1,667 wins, 1,409 losses). Francona's highest ranking in any of the three statistics is 18th in wins.  Most road losses in a season ‚Äì 101  Joe Quinn, batted just .286 with 0 homers in 640 plate appearances. The 1899 Cleveland Spiders (20‚Äì134) hold the MLB record for the most road losses in a single season, with 101. They were so bad ‚Äì 20 wins below the 1962 New York Mets ‚Äì they likely set an unbreakable record for fewest wins in a season at the same time. What is unusual, however, about their road loss record compared to others on this list is that while most others are theoretically possible (but impractical) to break, it cannot mathematically be broken even if a team achieved a completely winless season on the road: in today's sport, the 162-game season is equally divided between 81 home and road games, 21 fewer than needed to set a new mark. While rainouts and other cancellations can reduce the number of games a team plays in a season, there is no way to accumulate the 21 extra road games needed to break the record. The only situation in which regular season games are ever added to the schedule is in the case of the one-game playoff; the odds of a team losing all of its road games but still having a record strong enough to qualify for such a game are infinitesimally small. In the uncommon circumstance that a game must be moved to the opposing venue, MLB policy now maintains the legal fiction that the designated home team does not change, regardless of venue, which ensures the designated home team does not lose rules advantages. This was not the case in 1899, when 35 of the Spiders' home games were changed to road games. Three other factors contribute to the unique nature of the Spiders' record: * In 1899, owners were allowed to own more than one team, and in the case of the Spiders, the owners also owned the St. Louis Perfectos (now Cardinals). Believing it more profitable to have a good team in St. Louis, the Spiders' best players from 1898 ‚Äì including future Hall of Fame pitchers Cy Young, Jesse Burkett and Bobby Wallace ‚Äì were given to the Perfectos in exchange for their least desirable players, with their manager, Patsy Tebeau. From 1900, MLB rules have prohibited a single owner owning more than one team to avoid any repeat of this, or any similar, arrangements. * Baseball teams in 1899 had gate receipts as their main source for revenue. Since fans in Cleveland were not going to pay to watch a decimated roster, the Spiders/Perfectos ownership transferred all of the Spiders' home games against the Perfectos to St. Louis. As the season wore on and the crowds in Cleveland shrunk in response to mounting losses, the other 11 NL teams requested the Spiders transfer home games to their parks, as their cut of the gate receipts would leave them unable to recoup the expenses of the journey. Since the Spiders' cut of the gate receipts for road games was far more lucrative than their gate receipts for home games, the Spiders' owners were not inclined to object to such requests. Thus, the Spiders only played eight home games after July 1, giving them the opportunity for 101 road losses (against 11 wins). ** Today, MLB revenue streams are far more numerous, while in the case of media rights are often both contractually dependent on teams playing their entire schedule, and are not affected by attendance, while travel expenses make up a much smaller portion of a team's budget. MLB rules also state any team that refuses to travel to their opponent's stadium for a scheduled game would immediately forfeit the game. * The 1899 Spiders played their entire 154-game schedule ‚Äì an unusual occurrence in an era when cancellations were much more frequent, and cancelled games were often not made up. The 1899 Spiders also hold the records for the most losses in a single MLB season (with 134) and lowest winning percentage (.130). While these are technically possible to break, even under a 162-game schedule, only two teams have come within 15 losses of the record, these being the expansion 1962 New York Mets (40‚Äì120, .250 winning percentage) and the 2003 Detroit Tigers (43‚Äì119, .265 winning percentage). Since 1899, only five teams have recorded a winning percentage under .260 (i.e. less than double that of the 1899 Spiders), and the 1962 Mets are the only team to do so under a 162-game schedule. Excluding the possibility of cancelled games not being made up, a team would need to lose 141 games over a 162-game season to record a .130 winning percentage (this yields a .129 winning percentage if the traditional rounding to three decimal places is ignored).

History During the Dissolution reign of King Henry VIII around 1540 the Friary at Francis Street, the site of the current church of St. Nicholas of Myra (Without), Francis Street, was confiscated and the community was dispersed. In 1615 a new friary was built on Cook Street. A chapel on the site was destroyed in 1619 and later rebuilt.Franciscans in Merchants Quay The Franciscans secretly said Mass in the Adam and Eve Tavern, where the popular name of the present church comes from.Merchants Quay Ireland / Profile and History In 1759 a newer church was built, which was later replaced by the current church. After the Catholic Emancipation in 1829, they set about building a church and laid the foundation stone of the current church in 1834. The original design was by the architect Patrick Byrne who planned a tower on the Merchant's Quay entrance. However due to financial problems the church was built without a nave or tower.Conlan, Patrick, (2004). \\"Guide to the Church of the Immaculate Conception and Friary of Adam and Eve, Dublin\\", Church leaflet The church was originally dedicated to Saint Francis but in 1889 it was rededicated to the Immaculate Conception of Our Lady. After 1900, the church was reorganised with the moving of the altar to the left wall and the original sanctuary was changed into a transept and entrance from Cook Street. A small nave was added to the right and a dome built over the sanctuary. In 1912 a shrine to Saint Anthony was built in 1912 to designs by the architects Doolin, Butler and Donnelly. In 1926 to celebrate the seventh centenary of Saint Francis, the friars built a circular apse, remodelled the transepts and extended the nave with an entrance to Skippers Alley. The consecration of the high altar took place on 21 September 1928 by Dr. Paschal Robinson, titular Archbishop of Tyana (1870-1948). Organ The organ of Adam and Eve's was built by T.W. Magahy in 1936 using pipework from the old Telford organ there. It was rebuilt in 1996 by Trevor Crowe Ldt. There are around 3,000 pipes in the organ, seventy of which are gilded and incorporated in the casework. It is claimed to be the largest pipe organ in a Catholic church in Dublin and is very highly regarded.

Percina are benthic and benthic-associated fishes. Percina sciera belongs to the family Percidae, which along with Etheostomatinae comprise approximately 20-percent of the recognized diversity in North American freshwater fish.Carlson, R.L., and P.C. Wainwright. 2010. The ecological morphology of darter fishes (Percidae: Etheostomatinae). Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 100:30-45. Land development may threaten P. sciera habitat.Skyfield, J.P., and G.D. Grossman. 2008. Microhabitat use, movements and abundance of gilt darters (\\"Percina evides\\") in southern Appalachian (USA) streams. Ecology of Freshwater Fish 17:219-230. Percina prefer low water velocity in riffle/pool transition areas primarily on top of woody debris in a sandy/boulder substrate.Welsh, S.A., and S.A. Perry. 1998. Habitat partitioning in a community of darters in the Elk River, West Virginia. Environmental Biology of Fishes 51:411-419. Geographic distribution Percina sciera is considered both a wide-ranging and geographically restricted species that inhabits a variety of freshwater habitats including creeks, streams, rivers as well as lakes and reservoirs in the Mississippi River drainage.Carlson, R.L., P.C. Wainwright, and T.J. Near. 2010. Relationship between species co-occurrence and rate of morphological change in Percina darters (Percidae: Etheostomatinae). Evolution 63:767-778. P. sciera is found in the eastern United States in areas ranging from the Tennessee Tombigbee waterway,Miller, G.L. 1983. Trophic Resource Allocation between Percina sciera and P. ouachitae in the Tombigbee River, MississRippi. American Midland Naturalist 110:299-313. to the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau section of Southern Ohio,Cavender, T.M., and D.L. Rice. 1997. Survey and analysis of the Scioto Brush Creek drainage fish fauana of Southern Ohio. Ohio Journal of Science 97:78-85. to the second and fourth order streams within the Pine Hills of the Mississippi coastal plain. P. sciera has also been studied and monitored in lower Tallahala Creek near its confluence with the Leaf River, which is within the Pascagoula River drainage. Sympatric darter species, including P. sciera, segregate along several resource axes in the Appalachians such as the Elk River, West Virginia, one of several ‚Äúislands‚Äù of fish diversity in the Eastern Highlands of the Mississippi River drainage system. Ecology=Microhabitats Percina sciera microhabitats range from shallow riffles to deep runs and slow pools, with a wide variety of substrates from large boulders to mixtures of sand and gravel. Interspecies interaction, such as with the black-banded darter, Percina nigrofasciata, occurs most often in either the same or adjacent microhabitats; microhabitat displacement is a common outcome of competition. In the Elk River, West Virginia, P. sciera inhabit microhabitats with a low water velocity in the riffle/pool transition areas (mean flow rate of 5.0 cubic centimeters per second at a mean depth of 45.4 cm.) primarily on top of small woody debris and sand/boulder substrates, a water velocity typically slower than for Etheostoma. Temperature and pH requirements are moderate and midrange, respectively, for P. sciera. Diet All species of Percina are carnivorous, most species feeding on aquatic insect larvae such as chironomids (midges), black flies, ephemeropterans (mayflies), and hydropsychids (caddisflies). In the first few days of feeding, the larval form, referred to as the first-feeding stage, has slow growth due to poorly developed digestive systems, poor nutrient uptake, and lack of predator skills.Labay, A.A., K. Collins, R.W. Standange, and T.M. Brandt. 2004. Gut Content of First-Feeding Wild Darters and Captive-Reared Dusky Darters. North American Journal of Aquaculture 66:153-157. Small (<.3mm) cladocerans such as Ceriodaphnia and Bosmina are a suitable food source for first-feeding dusky darters, although the quick, erratic movement of calanoid copepods and their long antennae limit the ingestion of first-feeding P. sciera. In laboratory settings, researchers found the dominant prey item for larvalP. sciera was Ceriodaphnia; as many as 20 specimens were found in one larval darter. The maximum diameter of prey ingested by larvae was 0.27 to 0.37 mm, which is 70 to 90-percent of the P. sciera larval gape width. Gut contents of adult P. sciera indicate diets of small, benthic, macroinvertebrates, typically less than five millimeters in length.Rakocinski, C. 1991. Prey-size relationships and feeding tactics of primitive stream-dwelling darters. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 48:681-693. Compared with other competing species, P. sciera eats more but smaller prey to maintain its metabolism. In the Pascagoula River drainage, P. sciera consume more than three times the volume of small and medium-sized baetid nymphs and small simuliid larvae than similar species such as P. nigrofasciata. Larger stream fish are more likely to inhabit areas that either maximize energy gain or minimize energy expenditure. Similarly, darter body size is positively correlated with prey size and diet breadth. Adult dusky darters prey on ephemeropteran, plecopteran and odonate nymphs, as well as trichopteran and dipteran larvae. Generally, prey size increases when darter size increases, but small darters tend to have better diets than large darters because of better positioning in relation to the prey-size spectrum. Feeding ecology and habitat use are the two axes along which Percina exhibit the greatest ecological divergence. Predation P. sciera larvae are vulnerable to predation from cyclopoid copepod. Watersnake predation is a frequent, but relatively poorly known, source of mortality for darters belonging to both Etheostoma and Percina.Warren, M.L., Jr; W.R. Haag, and A.M. Commens. 2004. Observations of watersnake (Nerodia Colubridae) predation on darters (Percidae). Southeastern Fishes Council Proceedings 47:1-3. Life history The spawning habits of P. sciera have been studied and propagated in a laboratory setting.Labay, A.A., R.W. Standage, and T.M. Brandt. 2004. Selected methods for dusky darter captive propagation. North American Journal of Aquaculture 66:146-152. P. sciera were reared from eggs to first spawn sexual maturity in a one-year period. At age-1, P. sciera males averaged a total length of 94mm and weighed 7.5 grams, while females averaged 83mm and weighed 4.9g. Age-1 fish can spawn with the same success as age-2 fish. P. sciera spawn over fine gravel (1-5mm in diameter) during a photothermal day length of 13-hours and water temperatures approaching 19 ¬∞C. Breeding females carry as many as 184 eggs ranging in diameter from 1.65-1.78mm. In one laboratory experiment, 6,372 eggs yielded only 720 Percina sciera larvae. Some darters in the family Percidae have been collected at ages up to four-years.Ashton, M.J., and J.B. Layzer. 2008. Distribution of the threatened Snail Darter (Percina tanasi) in the upper Tennessee River Drainage. Journal of the Tennessee Academy of Science 83:52-56. Current management Nineteen darter species are federally listed as endangered and threatened in the U.S. For example, a related species, the Amber darter (Percina antesella) has struggled due to changes in habitat.Wenger, S.J., M.C. Freeman, L.A. Fowler, B.J. Freeman, and J.T. Peterson. 2010. Conservation planning for imperiled aquatic species in an urbanizing environment. Landscape and Urban Planning 97:11-21. Additional darter species are listed by states. P. sciera itself is not federally listed as endangered, despite being extirpated from North Carolina.Rhode, F.C., M.L. Miller, and R.G. Arndt. 1998. Distribution and status of selected fishes in North Carolina, with a new state record. Brimleyana 25:43-68. The biggest threat to P. sciera involves in- stream physical habitat alterations influenced by human activities, including non-forested land use (agriculture, residential and industrial development), effluent discharge, and water withdrawal.Rashleigh, B., R. Parmar, J.M. Johnston, and M.C. Barber. 2005. North American Journal of Fisheries Management 25:1353-1366. These human activities in the watershed alter stream morphology and increase sediment buildup and temperature, which disrupt the substrate composition in the streambed and can lead to reduced feeding, growth, and reproductive success for P. sciera. Another important stressor is the mixture of roadway surface contaminants that may be toxic to endemic darters and other stream fishes. The United States Environmental Protection Agency concluded that physical habitat alteration represents the greatest potential stressor to fish communities in more than half the streams in the mid-Atlantic Highlands, where some fish communities are in fair or poor condition. Protecting or conserving critical habitat requires mitigation of anthropogenic effects. For most stream-dwelling fishes, altered stream flood hydrology from increased stormflow runoff is a major source of disturbance.Walters, D.M., D.S. Leigh, M.C. Freeman, B.J. Freeman, and C.M. Pringle. 2003. Geomorphology and fish assemblages in a Piedmont river basin, U.S.A. Freshwater Biology 48:1950-1970. While some flooding is natural, both the frequency and severity of damage may be exacerbated in areas with numerous impervious surfaces (roadways, parking lots, etc.). Surface runoff during storm events can significantly increase stream velocity and alter stream hydrology with channelization and excessive sediment deposits. Stormwater performance standards can set limits on the amount of precipitation that can leave a site as surface runoff, by infiltrating runoff into the soil. Artificial propagation, although not always effective, may help recovery efforts. A network of pipes, wells, and collection trays (which contain gravel for larvae) has been used as a rearing and spawning area, the photoperiod breeding requirements of darters mimicked with controlled ambient light timer settings, and temperature and pH kept similar to those in the wild. Population monitoring P. sciera sampling sites are determined by identifying areas that fit the geomorphology of the species, looking for suitable gradient, substrate, flow and sediment transport, depth, and width. P. sciera populations can be monitored by seining and electrofishing (used to capture the fish for length and weight measurements) and snorkeling (to locate P. sciera). Electroshocking provides one of the best alternatives for obtaining abundance estimates for small nongame fishes, which are not well- suited to mark-recapture techniques.Habera, J.W., M.A. Kulp, S.E. Moore, and T.B. Henry. 2010. Three-Pass Depletion Sampling Accuracy of Two Electric Fields for Estimating Trout Abundance in a Low-Conductivity Stream with Limited Habitat Complexity. North American Journal of Fisheries Management 30:757-766. Gasoline-powered AC electrofishing units consisting of two hand- held electrodes can be used for fish capture. The units typically have one of the two electrodes fitted with a 4-mm mesh/nylon net to enable the operator to capture fish, which is usually done in an upstream manner. Sites sampled should be divided into 100 m sections that have block nets placed at the upper and lower ends of the site to restrict immigration and emigration. A stationary seine (4.6 m wide and 1.2 m tall) can be used in conjunction with the electroshocking technique when kept downstream of the shocking. A typical sampling crew consists of four people: two seine holders, an electroshocking operator, and a person either kicking into the seine or assisting with the seine in strong flow. When searching for P. sciera, snorkelers, who should never be in the water while electrofishing is underway, begin at the downstream end of the site and slowly proceeded upstream in a random zig-zag direction to observe as much area as possible in expansive shoals, riffles, and runs.

During World War II, Hawk helped to supply plastic identification models for use in military training.Fischer, op. cit. In 1946, Hawk produced one of the first all-plastic model kits, the Curtis R3C-1 racer.Fischer, op. cit/ Four additional kits (all classic 1930s racers) were added in 1948; the Gee Bee, Howard Ike, Laird Solution and Supermarine S6B. These early kits were molded in acetate plastic, but from 1949 Hawk employed polystyrene in its injection-molding process.Fischer, op. cit. The kits were advertised as ‚Äú1/4 scale‚Äù, meaning ¬º inch equals 1 scale foot or 1/48th scale. Additional increasingly sophisticated tooling was developed into the 1960s. By the time of its sale to Testors Corp. in 1970, the company's catalog included a wide range of realistic scale replicas of aircraft, ships, missiles, vehicles and conceptual subjects in 1/48, 1/72, 1/96, 1/144 and smaller scales. Among notable releases: * LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin (in 1/245 scale, when finished, this kit measured 38.5 inches long.) * Lockheed Constellation (the company's first polystyrene kit) * Lockheed U-2 (1/48 - One of its most popular and accurate examples - based on the Garry Powers-flown variant) * Spirit of St. Louis (1/72 scale) * Messerschmitt Me 163 'Komet' German Interceptor * Gee Bee racer (the original 1948 tooling was still being re-boxed by Testors Corp. into the early years of the 21st century.) * Spad XIII World War I-era biplane * Mister Mulligan Benny Howard racer * Travelaire Mystery Ship racer * Grumman F8F Bearcat * North American P-51 Mustang * Vickers Viscount 735 Series in Capital Airlines markings (1/96 scale) - later re-issued by Glencoe Models. * Manned Orbiting Laboratory (a conceptual space model) * 3 Rocket-Powered Guided Missiles Many of these original Hawk kits have been reissued periodically using the original molds.

The harlequin darter displays a green coloration on its sides, with six or seven brown saddles present along the top of the body. The belly of this darter is generally a yellow or tan color with dark blotches present, and the base of the caudal peduncle and caudal fin show a B shape. The first dorsal fin is characterized by being clear with a red boundary. The other fins are mostly dark, with many dark blotches. Males and females of this species look similar except during the breeding season, when males display a much brighter green color than females. Nuptial tubercles in this species are absent. The name harlequin darter refers to mask-like pigmentation on the face, consisting of a suborbital bar and dark blotching on the head, breast, and body.Etnier, David A. and Wayne C. Starnes. 1993.

Within Tennessee, the harlequin darter only occurs in the western portion of the state, within the Mississippi River and western Tennessee River tributaries. The extent of the harlequin darter's range is believed to be underestimated due to its preferred habitat type. The harlequin darter prefers areas full of woody debris in large, fast-moving bodies of water, requiring special sampling methods and likely resulting in a high degree of sampling error.Fisher, Brant.

Biodiversity of fishes in the Wabash River: status, indicators, and threats. Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science 115(2): 136-148. This species is only found in one watershed, the Escambia, in Florida. Due to the limited occurrence of this species in Florida, it is particularly vulnerable to catastrophic events within this limited range. It was further cut off from other nearby populations by the building of dams in Alabama.Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Harlequin Darter Biological Status Review Report. Retrieved from http://myfwc.com/media/2273322/Harlequin-Darter-BSR.pdf. The harlequin darter is fairly widely distributed, but is largely uncommon within its range.  Ecology  The diet of the harlequin darter consists of benthic invertebrates, including larvae from midges, caddisflies, mayflies, and blackflies.Texas Water Development Board. Fluvial Focal Species Summary Report. Retrieved from http://www.twdb.state.tx.us/publications/reports/contracted_reports/doc/0900010976_Fluvial.pdf. Ecological specialization is one of the top reasons darters have such an incredible amount of diversity.Page, Lawrence M. and David L. Swofford. 1984. Morphological correlates of ecological specialization in darters. Environmental Biology of Fishes 2: 139-159. Within its range, the harlequin darter prefers moderate- to fast-flowing riffles with fairly high water quality conditions; but what sets it apart is its dependence on detritus and downed woody debris. It is one of the few darter species reliably found within the main channel of the Mississippi River, and it often avoids smaller streams. Agricultural runoff tends to accumulate heavily into these large water bodies, greatly increasing nitrate and phosphate levels, creating an unfavorable environment for these darters. Also, companies along these larger bodies of water tend to remove vegetation and woody debris in riparian zones, further negatively affecting the harlequin darter.  Lifecycle  Harlequin darters spawn once in February or March.Missouri Department of Conservation. Best Management Practices (Harlequin Darter). Retrieved from http://mdc.mo.gov/sites/default/files/resources/2010/08/9481_6423.pdf The female seeks out an appropriate nesting site as the male follows. Snags or downed woody debris usually serve as prime nesting habitats for this species. When the eggs are released, they attach to detritus within deep water at the nesting site. Sexual maturity of females occurs at one year of age. The fecundity of this species has a broad range, from 90-450 eggs being produced, depending on age of the female. The maximum lifespan of this species is four years. This species is believed to participate in a relatively high amount of seasonal movement. Late spring through fall are generally spent in smaller streams, and during the colder months, movement occurs into larger reservoirs and other large bodies of water. After spawning, the adults are thought to move away from large bodies of water into smaller streams, leaving behind the young of the year in the large rivers and reservoirs for the rest of that year. During sampling efforts, in areas where adults were reliably caught in the winter, only young of that year's harlequin darters were caught that May in the same water bodies. So dams and other barriers to movement may be negatively affecting the lifecycle of this species. It is probably further being negatively affected by removal of downed woody debris within the water bodies preferred for spawning beds.  Management  Currently, management for this species is lacking in most areas. Sampling for this species is difficult, resulting in a lack of population data throughout its range. Due to this fact, the IUCN status of this species has not yet been evaluated. However, the harlequin darter is not considered a federally endangered or threatened species. Few states have management plans in place for this species. The Missouri Department of Conservation, one of the few that have developed best management practices for the harlequin darter, restricts the dates when work can be done near wetlands to protect harlequin darter breeding, leaves vegetation and woody debris in water bodies, puts up sediment controls such as silt fences, avoids the use of permanent dams that restrict movement, and avoids stream crossings by using culverts or detouring routes that cross streams where the harlequin darter resides. A biological status review conducted in Florida determined many of the same management problems, including woody debris removal, damming water bodies, turbidity, and sediment loads lead to the decrease in harlequin darter numbers. This review also listed oil and coal exploration as potential threats to the success of this species. However, no direct management plan has been formed for the Florida population of harlequin darters. This is notable, considering the harlequin darter is considered a species of special concern within Florida.  Recommendations  The harlequin darter exhibits some degree of seasonal movement, going from large rivers into smaller tributaries for part of the year, so the removal of dams and other dispersal barriers would benefit this species. This species also relies heavily on woody, organic debris over sandy bottoms. Management for this species should include limiting removal of vegetation and downed woody debris in and around water bodies where this species is found. Furthermore, because this species relies on a habitat difficult to properly sample, extra sampling efforts should be undertaken within its range to determine the actual population numbers for this species. In addition, nonpoint source pollution and agricultural runoff may be negatively affecting this species. Using best management practices and streamside management zones could alleviate this problem and increase the health of water bodies, not only for the harlequin darter, but for most other aquatic species present, as well. Enforcing the use of silt fences around areas of construction would reduce the sedimentation. Also, encouraging landowners to use the conservation reserve program through the United States Department of Agriculture would not only reduce soil erosion and improve water quality, but would also benefit the human population by enhancing groundwater recharge and reducing potential flood damage.

Biography Paul Bartlett R√© was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico in the US in 1950. Valedictorian of his high school, R√© went on to earn a B.Sc. in Physics from the California Institute of Technology in 1972, graduating with honors (fifth in his class).(Veronda, Winifred, 1989) R√© selected as his first medium the drawing pencil. Writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, art critic Alfred Frankenstein said, \\"R√© is a virtuoso of the pencil which he uses with incredible delicacy and refinement.\\" (Frankenstein, Alfred, 1974) Paul R√© has also exhibited acrylic paintings, found object constructions, sculpture, bas-reliefs, embossings, R√©ograms (hybrid hand-digital prints), and sumi-e paintings. In the encyclopedia, Contemporary Graphic Artists, art historian Denis Wepman wrote, \\"The singular purity of R√©'s simple, highly stylized designs gives them a unique place in modern art . . . The extraordinary sensitivity of their line and composition appeals to the senses with a haunting directness.\\" (Wepman, Dennis, 1988) R√© started exhibiting in California and New Mexico during the 1970s. Since then, he has had 22 solo exhibits in 13 states, including at the UNM Jonson Gallery, Albuquerque Museum, Triangle Gallery, Wichita Museum, Sumter Gallery, J. B. Speed Museum, the Colorado Springs Museum and the Karpeles Museum.https://www.amazon.com/Art-Peace-Transcendence-R√©ograms- Elevate/dp/0826355153 In 1979, R√© began creating the embossed works which gave a tactile form to his visual creations and the resulting exhibition ‚ÄúTOUCHABLE ART: An Exhibit for the Blind and the Sighted‚Äù travelled in the United States and into Canada from 1981 to 1994. During its 18 showings, about 100,000 people experienced the works; a handmade, thermoformed companion volume with Braille and text was produced in 1983.

Gen. Earl van Dorn The Army of West Tennessee was a short-lived Confederate army led by Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn, which fought principally in the Second Battle of Corinth. The army was organized from elements of the Army of the West on September 28, 1862, with Earl Van Dorn its first and only commander. On November 24, 1862, Adjutant General Samuel Cooper issued a ruling that the army's name and function were \\"improper\\" and on December 9, 1862, the units of the Army of West Tennessee were merged into the Army of Mississippi under Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton. History As part of his preparations for the Perryville offensive, General Braxton Bragg divided Mississippi into several commands: Major General Earl Van Dorn was given command of the District of the Mississippi, centered in Vicksburg, and Major General Sterling Price was given the District of the Tennessee, covering northwestern Mississippi and northeastern Alabama. Bragg expected Price to prevent the Union forces of Ulysses S. Grant and William Rosecrans in western Tennessee from reinforcing the Union forces in Kentucky, and expected Van Dorn to cooperate with Price. Price interpreted Bragg's orders as to mean that he was to attack the Union forces. Van Dorn, however, choose to move against the Union forces threatening Vicksburg and launched an attack on Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which failed; he then proposed a joint attack with Price on Corinth. Price by this time had decided not to wait for Van Dorn but moved against Iuka, capturing the town on September 14. Two Union columns, commanded by Grant and Rosecrans, converged on Iuka on September 19; Price attacked Rosecrans' force and due to poor communications and an acoustic shadow Grant failed to attack in concert. When he discovered that Grant was approaching from the northwest, Price decided to retreat before he was surrounded.Cozzens, pp. 42-45, 50-51, 70, 115. Price united with Van Dorn at Ripley, Mississippi, on September 28 and placed himself under his command. Price's army was redesignated as Price's Corps; the other parts of Van Dorn's army were the forces of his District of the Mississippi, Mansfield Lovell's infantry division and a small cavalry brigade commanded by Colonel W. H. Jackson (this force reported directly to Van Dorn). Van Dorn then laid out a planned offensive against Corinth: the Confederates would first march to Pocahontas, northwest of Corinth, to confuse Grant and Rosecrans, then they would attack Corinth before the Union forces could concentrate. Although several officers, including Price and Lovell, were opposed to the plan, they still followed Van Dorn's orders. The march began on September 29 and the Confederates arrived outside Corinth on October 3.Cozzens, pp. 136-143. The two-day Battle of Corinth began on October 3, with Confederate attacks overrunning the first line of Union entrenchments north of Corinth. Much of the fighting was done by Price's corps on the Confederate left; Lovell on the Confederate right overran the initial Union positions and then halted, perhaps due to his objections to the campaign. Price had to halt his attacks close to dusk due to increasing disorganization in his divisions and to Lovell's inactivity. The next day, Van Dorn planned another series of attacks, starting at daylight with Louis Hebert's division of Price's corps on the left flank, with the remaining units continuing the attack. However, the attack was delayed when Hebert reported himself sick and his successor had to be informed of the attack plan and move his division into position. Price's two divisions were able to capture several parts of the Union second line of fortifications, with some units entering the town of Corinth itself, but Union counterattacks forced the Confederates back. Lovell failed to attack at all.Cozzens, pp. 166-193, 215-216, 228-230, 235-270. Following the repulse of Price's attacks, Van Dorn decided to retreat towards the Davis Bridge over the Hatchie River that evening, with Price's corps in front and Lovell's division serving as rear guard; he briefly considered attacking Corinth again from the southwest but was talked out of it by Price. The next day, the Confederates learned that another Union force commanded by Stephen A. Hurlbut was approaching from the west towards the Davis Bridge, thus cutting off the Confederate line of retreat. One of Price's divisions was assigned to delay Hurlbut until the rest of the army reached another crossing six miles to the south; during the resulting engagement, the Confederates were able to delay Hurlbut sufficiently to enable their escape. Van Dorn reached Ripley on October 7, but due to the poor condition of his army and a shortage of supplies at Ripley he decided to continue onto Holly Springs.Cozzens, pp. 272-273, 277-279, 285-290, 300. During the Corinth campaign, Price lost over 3,700 casualties out of 13,800 men, nearly 35 percent of his force; Lovell, by contrast, lost only 570 out of 7,000 men. Both Lovell and Van Dorn were blamed for the Confederate defeat, with Lovell especially criticized by Price's troops. In December, Van Dorn's command was abolished and merged with Price's command into a new Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana commanded by John C. Pemberton; Van Dorn himself was reassigned to a cavalry corps.Cozzens, pp. 305-307, 310; Civil War Armies.

It was taken from Cookin' with The Miracles, the group's second album, and was written by Miracles members Smokey Robinson and Ronald White. It entered the Billboard Pop and R&B; listings that year, and reached #52 and #11 respectively. Similar to the group's first million-selling hit single, \\"Shop Around\\", this song is an \\"advice\\" record. Whereas on the earlier tune Smokey, as the song's narrator, received advice from his mama, who told him \\"You better Shop Around\\", this time it is Smokey who is giving life's advice to his own son, telling him about the trials and errors in the search to find true love in the song's preface: *If ever I have a son in life I'll call him in one day... *And sit him down upon my knee And here is what I'll say.... In his trademark poetic fashion, as the doting father, Smokey continues... *You might lose your lover... People do sometimes... But it won't make sense for you... To sit around cryin'...' Don't you know that when you fall in love, sometimes... You're gonna have to lose... Well, it may take years, but you're gonna shed some tears...'cause Everybody's Gotta Pay Some Dues. The other Miracles, Bobby, Ronnie, Pete, and Claudette, provide their backing harmonies to punctuate Smokey's vocals on the chorus and elsewhere, using classic call and response vocals on the song's bridge. The song was laden with heavy strings throughout, and was actually, despite its modest chart placing, very important in establishing the Miracles' sound and fan base, proving that they were far from being \\"one hit wonders\\". It kept their name on the charts, and Motown's name in the trade papers, (Billboard, Cash Box, etc.). It also established the beginnings of what later came to be known as \\"The Motown Sound\\", and featured a level of sophistication not found on previous Miracles' singles releases. The Miracles' importance to Motown during this earlier period cannot be overstated, as they were the label's first group, and the only act on the label to enjoy a consistent string of chart hit records during the company's critical early years, 1959-1964. This song was arranged by famed Chicago-based conductor/arranger Riley C. Hampton. This was the first time an outside arranger was employed on a Motown release. Ironically, while Everybody's Got to Pay Some Dues was one of The Miracles' best early hits, it is also one of the least acclaimed: only one cover version is known by fellow Motown artist, Marv Johnson, who recorded a version in 1967. It wasn't even included in the group's first greatest hits album, Greatest Hits from the Beginning. It has, however, since been included in their 35th Anniversary Collection box set, and a few other Miracles compilations, including the group's 2009 2 -disc compilation release, The Miracles‚ÄìDepend On Me: The Early Albums .

Alexander II was killed while returning to the Winter Palace from Mikhailovsky Man√®ge in a closed carriage. The assassination was planned by the Executive Committee of Narodnaya Volya (\\"People's Will\\"), chiefly by Andrei Zhelyabov. Of the four assassins coordinated by Sophia Perovskaya, two of them actually committed the deed. One assassin, Nikolai Rysakov, threw a bomb which damaged the carriage, prompting the Tsar to dismount. At this point a second assassin, Ignacy Hryniewiecki, threw a bomb that fatally wounded Alexander II. Alexander II had previously survived several attempts on his life, including the attempts by Dmitry Karakozov and Alexander Soloviev, the attempt to dynamite the imperial train in Zaporizhia, and the bombing of the Winter Palace in February 1880. The assassination is popularly considered to be the most successful action by the Russian nihilist movement of the 19th century. The conspirators On 25‚Äì26 August of 1879, on the anniversary of his coronation, the 22-member Executive Committee of Narodnaya Volya, resolved to assassinate Alexander II in the hopes that it would precipitate a revolution. Over the subsequent year and a half, the various attempts on Alexander's life had ended in failure. The Committee then decided to assassinate Alexander II on his way back to the Winter Palace following his usual Sunday visit to the Mikhailovsky Man√®ge. Andrei Zhelyabov was the chief organizer of the plot. The group had observed his routines for a couple of months and was able to deduce the alternate intentions of the entourage. They found that the Tsar would either head for home by going through Malaya Sadovaya Street or by driving along the Catherine Canal. If by the Malaya Sadovaya, the plan was to detonate a mine placed under the street. To further insure the success of the plot, four bomb-throwers were to loiter at the corners of the street; after the explosion, all of them were to close in on the Tsar and use their bombs if necessary. If, on the other hand, Tsar passed by the Canal, the bomb-throwers alone were to be relied upon. Ignacy Hryniewiecki (Ignaty Grinevitsky), Nikolai Rysakov, Timofey Mikhailov, and Ivan Yemelyanov had volunteered as bomb-throwers. The group opened a cheese store in the Eliseyev Emporium on Malaya Sadovaya, and used one of the rooms to dig a tunnel extending to the middle of the street, where they would lay large quantities of dynamite. The hand-held bombs were designed and chiefly manufactured by Nikolai Kibalchich. The night before the attack, Perovskaya along with Vera Figner (also one of seven women on the Executive Committee) helped assemble the bombs. Zhelyabov was to have directed the bombing, and he was supposed to assail Alexander II with dagger or pistol in case both the mine and the bombs were unsuccessful. When Zhelyabov was arrested two days prior to the attack, his wife Sophia Perovskaya took the reins.

He was accompanied by five mounted Cossacks and Frank (Franciszek) Joseph Jackowski, a Polish noble, with a sixth Cossack sitting on the coachman's left. The emperor's carriage was followed by three sleighs carrying, among others, the chief of police Colonel Dvorzhitzky and two officers of the Gendarmerie. On the afternoon of 13 March, after having watched the manoeuvres of two Guard battalions at the Man√®ge, the Tsar's carriage turned into Bolshaya Italyanskaya Street, thus avoiding the mine in Malaya Sadovaya. Perovskaya, by taking out a handkerchief and blowing her nose as a predetermined signal, dispatched the assassins to the Canal. On his way back, the Tsar also decided to pay a brief visit to his cousin, the Grand Duchess Catherine. This gave the bombers ample time to reach the Canal on foot; with the exception of Mikhailov, they all took up their new positions. The scene of the assassination immediately after the explosion of the first bomb. Alexander II's shattered carriage. At 2:15 PM, the carriage had gone about 150 yards down the quay until it encountered Rysakov who was carrying a bomb wrapped in a handkerchief. On the signal being given by Perovskaya, Rysakov threw the bomb under the Tsar's carriage. The Cossack who rode behind (Alexander Maleichev) was mortally wounded and died shortly that day. Among those injured was a fourteen year old peasant boy (Nikolai Zakharov) who served as a delivery boy in a butcher's shop. However, the explosion had only damaged the bulletproof carriage. The emperor emerged shaken but unhurt. Rysakov was captured almost immediately. Police Chief Dvorzhitsky heard Rysakov shout out to someone else in the gathering crowd. The coachman implored the Emperor not to alight. Dvorzhitzky offered to drive the Tsar back to the Palace in his sleigh. The Tsar agreed, but he decided to first see the culprit, and to survey the damage. He expressed solicitude for the victims. To the anxious inquires of his entourage, Alexander replied, \\"Thank God, I'm untouched\\". The uniform worn by Alexander II during the assassination. He was ready to drive away when a second bomber, Hryniewiecki, who had come close to the Tsar, made a sudden movement, throwing a bomb at his feet. A second explosion ripped through the air and the Emperor and his assassin fell to the ground terribly injured. Since people had crowded close to the Tsar, Hryniewiecki's bomb claimed more injuries than the first (according to Dvorzhitsky, who was himself injured, there were about 20 people with wounds of varying degree). Alexander was leaning on his right arm. His legs were shattered below the knee from which he was bleeding profusely, his abdomen was torn open, and his face was mutilated. Hryniewiecki himself, also gravely wounded from the blast, lay next to the Tsar and the butcher's boy. Ivan Yemelyanov, the third bomber in the crowd, stood ready, clutching a briefcase containing a bomb that would be used if the other two bombers failed. However, he instead along with other bystanders rushed to answer the Tsar's barely audible cries for help; he could barely whisper: \\"Take me to the palace... there... I will die.\\" Alexander was carried by sleigh to his study in the Winter Palace, where almost the same day twenty years earlier, he had signed the Emancipation Edict freeing the serfs. Members of the Romanov family came rushing to the scene. The dying emperor was given Communion and Last rites. When the attending physician, Sergey Botkin, was asked how long it would be, he replied, \\"Up to fifteen minutes.\\" At 3:30 that day, the personal flag of Alexander II was lowered for the last time. Arrests, trials, and punishments The thrower of the fatal second bomb, Hryniewiecki, was carried to the military hospital nearby, where he lingered in agony for several hours. Refusing to cooperate with the authorities or even to give his name, he died that evening. In an attempt to save his own life, Rysakov, the first bomb- thrower who had been captured at the scene, cooperated with the investigators. His testimony implicated the other participants, and enabled the police to raid the group's headquarters. The raid took place on March 15, two days after the assassination. Helfman was arrested and Sablin fired several shots at the police and then shot himself to avoid capture. Mikhailov was captured in the same building the next day after a brief gunfight. The tsarist police apprehended Sophia Perovskaya on March 22, Nikolai Kibalchich on March 29, and Ivan Yemelyanov on April 14.

Convicts from left to right: Rysakov, Zhelyabov, Perovskaya, Kibalchich, and Mikhailov. Zhelyabov, Perovskaya, Kibalchich, Helfman, Mikhailov, and Rysakov were tried by the Special Tribunal of the Ruling Senate on March 26‚Äì29 and sentenced to death by hanging. The sentence was duly carried out upon the State criminals on April 15, 1881. In the case of Hesya Helfman, her execution was deferred on account of her pregnancy. Alexander III later commuted her sentence of death to katorga (forced labor) for an indefinite period of time. She died of a post- natal complication in January 1882, and her infant daughter did not long survive her. Yemelyanov was tried the following year and was sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor, however, he received a pardon from the Tsar after serving 20 years. Vera Figner remained at large until 10 February 1883, during this time she orchestrated the assassination of General Mayor Strelnikov, the military prosecutor of Odessa. In 1884, Figner was sentenced to die by hanging which was then commuted to indefinite penal servitude. She likewise served for 20 years until a plea from her dying mother persuaded the last tsar, Nicholas II, to set her free. Aftermath The Church of the Savior on Blood was erected on the site of the assassination. The cobblestones of the old road, the flagstones of the sidewalk, and the iron railing along the edge of the quay where the assassination took place. A temporary shrine was erected on the site of the attack while plans and fundraising for a more permanent memorial were undertaken. In order to build a permanent shrine on the exact spot where the assassination took place, it was decided to narrow the canal so that the section of road on which the tsar had been driving could be included within the walls of the church. The permanent memorial took the form of the Church of the Savior on Blood. Construction began in 1883 under Alexander III, and was completed in 1907 under Nicholas II. An elaborate shrine, in the form of a ciborium, was constructed at the end of the church opposite the altar, on the exact place of Alexander's assassination. It is embellished with topaz, lazurite, and other semi-precious stones, making a striking contrast with the simple cobblestones of the old road, which are exposed in the floor of the shrine.

The hotel is a 300-year-old coaching inn and is a Grade II listed building. Its most distinctive feature is the Olympic Suite, a large room furnished with interior decorations from the RMS Olympic that are substantially identical to those aboard her sister ship, the RMS Titanic. History Originally established in the 18th century, the inn is recorded by the Universal British Directory as one of two existing in Alnwick in 1791. The Gentleman's Magazine noted in 1797 that it was \\"occupied by a man named Wilson, who at one time had lived as footman in the Hervey family.\\" W. Davison, writing in 1822, stated that the White Swan was \\"the principal inn ... at which the mail and union coaches stop, and all the posting on the great north road.\\" In 1852 Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland brought in the architect Anthony Salvin to remodel his family seat at Alnwick Castle. Salvin also remodelled the White Swan at the same time; the current frontage dates from this period. Since then the hotel has expanded into neighbouring buildings, which have been incorporated into it and converted into bedrooms. The hotel has undergone various extensions and renovations, including one in 1936 when its then owner, Algernon Smart, bought various elements from the decommissioned RMS Olympic and incorporated them into the fabric of the building. Description The hotel is a two-storey building, faced with a mid-19th century facade built of ashlar with an attic. The building is roofed in slate with three chimneys. The attic storey has a row of nine dormer windows, five of pedimented style edged with carved side scrolls, alternating with four of circular form. The left portion of the building has an arcade of three bays with channelled rustication. The central bay and the arched main entrance are both surmounted with stone balconies. Inside the hotel, which was given Grade II listed status on 25 August 1977, is the Olympic Suite, a room measuring and high which is furnished with panelled walls and decorated ceilings taken from the RMS Olympic. The room consists of three and a half bays and three aisles, with bay windows on the north and east sides. The hotel also incorporates elements of one of Olympics staircases and a revolving door from the ship. RMS Olympic fittings The hotel's Olympic Suite incorporates panelling, mirrors, a ceiling and stained-glass windows which were removed from the RMS Olympic when she was being dismantled in Jarrow in 1936. The hotel's then-owner, Algernon Smart, had been a frequent traveller on Olympic and took part in the auction of the ship's fittings in November 1935. At the auction, which was run by the London firm Knight Frank & Rutley, he had the winning bids for elements of the First Class Lounge, the Aft First Class Staircase, and the revolving door from the liner's restaurant. The First Class Lounge on Olympic was identical to that of her sister ship Titanic; both were designed and fitted by the same teams of craftsmen and artisans, as the two ships were constructed at nearly the same time. The interiors of the ships were designed by Aldam, Heaton & Co., who had previously worked on other White Star Line vessels and had also carried out interior design on the homes of White Star Line chairman J. Bruce Ismay and his family. Many of the ships' interiors were designed by the architect Arthur Henry Durand, who had studied architecture in Brussels between 1891‚Äì3 and participated in the design of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. He set up his own practice in London in 1903 and worked for both the White Star Line and P&O.; The lounge was described at the time as \\"a magnificent salon, pronounced by many persons as the finest room ever built into a ship. It is more suggestive of a state apartment in a palace than a room on shipboard.\\" The analogy was an apt one, as the room was decorated in the Louis XV style based on interiors at the Palace of Versailles. The walls were panelled with finest English oak carved with delicate boiseries decorated with scrolled floral-and-shell ornamentation, rather than the gilding that would have been seen in the French originals. At one end of the lounge was a non-functional grey marble fireplace with a carved mantelpiece and a curb of a pierced scroll-and-shell pattern, measuring wide in total. This too can be seen in the Olympic Suite. The equivalent lounge on Titanic was described by The Shipbuilder magazine as a place where, during voyages, \\"passengers will indulge in reading, conversation, cards, tea-drinking and other social intercourse.\\" It disintegrated during Titanics sinking, releasing many wooden fragments to float to the surface while strewing metal fittings across the sea bed. The Olympics fittings in the White Swan helped the oceanographer Robert Ballard to identify where the identical fittings from Titanic had come from when he found them in the debris field around the wreck of the Titanic. An archway from the lounge preserved at the hotel is identical to the same archway from Titanic which was recovered by ships from Halifax, Nova Scotia searching for bodies and is now displayed at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax. The room's decoration was crafted by joiners and artisans working for the Belfast shipbuilders Harland & Wolff, either in sheds at the shipyards in Queen's Island (now the Titanic Quarter) or brought in from outside contractors. No fewer than 186 woodcarvers worked on Olympics fittings. The usual practice was for the designers to produce composite sketches showing the general concept of the surface and carvings of an interior feature, along with a sectional profile of the general shape and proportion of the sculptural elements relative to one another. It was not intended to be an actual plan but served instead to give the woodcarver a general concept of how the design was to look. At the entrance to the hotel is the revolving door that was originally fitted to Olympics First Class restaurant entrance. This was a feature that only appeared on Olympic, which needed a way of keeping sea breezes out of the room. Titanic had no such need as changes to the ship's design made a revolving door unnecessary. The hotel also incorporates pieces from the Aft First Class Staircase. This was not as long or elaborate as the more famous forward Grand Staircase, as depicted in the 1997 film Titanic, but was decorated in a similar style, again in finely carved English oak. During the sinking of the Titanic, the ship split apart right across the aft staircase; many artefacts from it have been discovered in the wreck's debris field. However it has recently been discovered that at least the first portion of the staircase is in fact from the main Grand Staircase and not the Aft Staircase. This is due to the fact the staircase has thirteen steps and not eleven.http://www.rmsolympic.org/grand.html A photo composite has proved the bannister's origin.https://www.flickr.com/photos/paulhurst/2193113716/in/album-72157603715416901/ See also *Old Swan Hotel in Harrogate, also a member of the Classic Lodges group.

He is best known for founding the Jefferson Medical College and the Medical Department of Pennsylvania College, and his pioneering work in surgery, including writing a widely used textbook.  Life  George McClellan was born in Woodstock, Connecticut, on December 22, 1796 to a family of Scottish ancestry. His great- grandfather fought on the Jacobite side in the Battle of Culloden, the last pitched battle in Britain, before immigrating to Worcester, Massachusetts. George McClellan's grandfather, Samuel McClellan was a Brigadier General in the American Revolutionary War. Throughout his life, George McClellan was known for his personality, having a mix of positive and negative traits. He had a good memory for names and faces of virtually everyone he met. One former student recalled a brief meeting with the doctor and then being recognized even one year later, stating, \\"the moment we entered Doctor McClellan's office, he recognized and named each one of us, although he had seen us only once before, a year back, and only a very short time.\\" However, Darrach wrote, \\"McClellan had his peculiarities.\\" He often came across as disrespectful and even insubordinate and spoke in a \\"rapid incoherent manner.\\" It has been noted that he routinely perturbed individuals above him in title. Nonetheless, some people just accepted this as something that came with his \\"surgical zeal.\\" McClellan's famous family includes his wife, Elizabeth (Brinton), two sons, John Hill Brinton McClellan, who was a physician, and the other, General George Brinton McClellan, who was a major general during the American Civil War. His grandson, George McClellan (1849‚Äì1913) became the Chair of Anatomy at Jefferson Medical College and authored the famous medical text, Regional Anatomy. George McClellan died early in the morning on May 9, 1847 from exsanguination due to an ulcerated lesion below the sigmoid flexure of the colon. He is interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery, Philadelphia.  Career  McClellan entered into the sophomore class at Yale at the age of sixteen and excelled in mathematics and published natural sciences articles in the American Journal of Science. In 1815, at age 18, he obtained his baccalaureate degree. He then took up the study of medicine, first with Thomas Hubbard of Pomfret, Connecticut, later Professor of Surgery of the Medical College of New Haven, with whom he remained one year. In 1817, he went to Philadelphia to attend medical lectures at the University of Pennsylvania, and to become the private pupil of John Syng Dorsey, Professor of Materia Medica, receiving his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1819.  Founder of medical schools  George McClellan gave a series of private anatomy lectures before deciding to found a new medical school. Many unsuccessful requests had already been made for a new medical school in Philadelphia so he and others had the idea to couple it with Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. With this in mind, he and others made a request to the Legislature of Pennsylvania in 1824, and in 1825, received a charter for what was to become Jefferson Medical College. With the \\"highly regarded\\" University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine already being in Philadelphia, it was considered \\"professional heresy\\" to open a second school, but McClellan thought that opening a second medical school would just lead to more students going to Philadelphia to study medicine. Because of this, physicians at that time noted that he had to choose instructors \\"greatly inferior in talent to himself\\" and it was not a sure thing that the school would survive. The Jefferson Medical College opened in 1826, in Philadelphia, and in 1836 had an entering class of 360 medical students nonetheless and McClellan lectured in surgery. In 1838, Jefferson College separated from Jefferson Medical College, and all instructors, including McClellan, were vacated and the trustees hired all new individuals to teach. This change, unrelated to McClellan's leaving, led the school came to be considered a \\"legitimate\\" medical school. For his next project, McClellan opened The Medical Department of Pennsylvania College with Samuel Colhoun, William Rush, and Samuel George Morton in Philadelphia, giving the first course of lectures in November 1839. Due to monetary circumstances, the four men resigned their professorships in 1843. In 1858, the school planned to merge with the Philadelphia College of Medicine, but that school closed the next year in 1859. 1861 saw the Medical Department of Pennsylvania College close due to unpaid bills and low enrollment secondary to the American Civil War. Nonetheless, his extended medical education system (referring to more years spent in school than the standard 2 to 3 at the time) became widely accepted and spread among schools.  As a teacher  Even before founding Jefferson Medical College, McClellan was regarded as a great teacher, with his colleague, William Darrach, stating, \\"[a] teacher so qualified will attract pupils.\\" He had added an anatomy and surgery teaching room next to his office and lectured nightly to students of his medical classes. Before, and while at Jefferson, McClellan had a successful lectureship in surgery until 1838 when Jefferson College separated from Jefferson Medical College and the teaching positions were all vacated. He then went on to teach at the new school he co- founded.  As a surgeon  McClellan was an accomplished and famous surgeon, leading to Samuel George Morton summing up what many of his contemporaries thought of him in a memorandum from March 8, 1845: > The day before yesterday I was present at an operation performed by Dr. > George McClellan, on a gentleman from Virginia. It consisted in the removal > of the whole of the parotid gland in a scirrhous and much enlarged state, > from the left side of the face. Nothing could exceed the combined coolness > and skill manifested by Dr. M. throughout this terrible operation, which he > has now performed for the eleventh time, and hitherto with remarkable > success. On this occasion, however, he was doomed to disappointment, for the > patient died last night, about thirty-six hours after the operation. > McClellan sent for me in the evening, to see the dying man with him, and we > met in the chamber of death between ten and eleven o'clock. I had sometimes > heard McClellan spoken of as a heartless surgeon, devoid of feeling or > sympathy for those who came under his knife; but I can solemnly aver that I > have seldom witnessed more unaffected sorrow than he manifested on this > occasion. He walked the room incessantly, and repeatedly clasped my hands in > his, while he expressed, in emphatic language, the feelings that preyed upon > his mind. He moreover assured me, that he seldom performed one of his > severer operations without first asking the blessing of God on his > undertaking; and that days and nights of painful anxiety, often preceded > those great professional efforts which have justly placed his name on the > pinnacle of surgical fame. The gurgling respiration of the unfortunate > patient announced the near approach of death, and I withdrew, full of > sympathy for the agonized emotions of my friend. His name became widespread and he was known to have performed more surgeries than any other during his lifetime. His fame led him to operate on patients from the United States, but he also attracted patients from Europe, the West Indies, and South America, especially for operations in ophthalmic surgery. McClellan was one of the first surgeons to perform a lens extraction, and was the first American to perform many operations, including removal of the parotid gland. Expertise led to his contributing to the American Medical Review and Journal, editing textbooks, and writing a widely used surgery textbook, The Principles and Practice of Surgery. The book was left as a manuscript in 1847, but was edited by his son John H. B. McClellan and published the following year.

Prior to joining the armed forces of the Second Bulgarian Empire, Ivan the Russian may have been a military commander in the service of the Hungarian governor of Severin. Ivan the Russian rose to a high rank in the Bulgarian military in the wake of the accession of Michael Shishman to the throne. In 1323, he was in charge of the Bulgarian defence of Plovdiv during the prolonged and ultimately successful Byzantine siege of the city. In 1328, he was involved in a failed Bulgarian attempt to capture the Byzantine capital Constantinople from within. Probably taking part in the turbulent events that surrounded and followed Michael Shishman's death, Ivan the Russian was last mentioned as a representative of Ivan Alexander in 1332. Early years and siege of Plovdiv Bulgarian historian Plamen Pavlov conjectures that Ivan the Russian was a Ruthenian born in the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia (centred on modern western Ukraine), a hypothesis based only on his ties to Hungary, the western neighbour of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia.–ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤. Hungarian sources from 1288 make notice of one Russian named Ivan (Iwan dicto Oroz) as an ally of the ban of Severin, Theodore Vejtehi from the kindred Csan√°d,V√°s√°ry, p. 124. who was one of the nobles that opposed the rule of Charles I of Hungary in 1316‚Äì1317. The land to the south of Severin was governed for Bulgaria by the despot of Vidin, Michael Shishman, a supporter of Vejtehi. Thus, as the Hungarian king established his authority over Severin and suppressed Vejtehi's rebellion, Ivan the Russian may have fled to Vidin and entered the service of Michael Shishman. Ivan is thought to have been joined, as a commander subordinate to the despot of Vidin, by his personal forces which consisted of Hungarians and, presumably, Russians. While Hungarian scholar Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rffy supports the identification of Ivan the Russian as the Iwan dicto Oroz of Hungarian chronicles, historian Istv√°n V√°s√°ry points to the lack of clear evidence and the large time span between the two.V√°s√°ry, pp. 124‚Äì125. Before that identification was proposed, it was considered that Ivan had arrived in Bulgaria after fleeing the Mongol conquest of Rus', much like another Russian in Bulgarian service, Jacob Svetoslav. Either way, in 1323 Ivan's right-hand man was a Hungarian named Inas.The name is recorded as Inas () in Byzantine sources and it has been identified with the old Hungarian name Ina. V√°s√°ry, p. 124. Michael Shishman's accession to the Bulgarian throne in 1323 meant that Ivan the Russian assumed an elite rank in the Bulgarian military hierarchy. Pavlov theorizes that he became protostrator, a title borrowed from Byzantium. The title was held by the second-in-command of the army and was approximate to the Western marshal. In the same year, Ivan was dispatched to the city of Plovdiv (Philippopolis) which had been recently conquered by Bulgaria after decades of Byzantine rule. With a one-thousand-strong cavalry force of Alans, Bulgarians–ë–∞–∫–∞–ª–æ–≤, ‚Äú–∞–≤–≥—É—Å—Ç, 1322 –≥.‚Äù and possibly Hungarians and two thousand infantrymen, Ivan was to defend the city from Byzantine raids. In that task he was assisted by his deputy Inas and the Alan chieftains Itil and Temir.Jireƒçek, p. 418. At the time, Ivan was already well-known even in Byzantium as a military commander. The Bulgarian forces commanded by Ivan the Russian managed to withstand the four-month siege of Plovdiv undertaken by Andronikos III Palaiologos, claimant to the Byzantine throne, and his Bulgarian ally Voysil, despot of Kopsis.V√°s√°ry, pp. 123‚Äì124.–ò—Ä–µ—á–µ–∫, p. 338. In their attempts to capture the city, the Byzantines employed German specialists to construct a siege machine, from which they fired with crossbows at the Bulgarian defenders.–ë–∞–∫–∞–ª–æ–≤, ‚Äú—Ñ–µ–≤—Ä—É–∞—Ä–∏, 1323 –≥.‚Äù Despite the elaborate siege tactics, by the summer of 1323 the Bulgarians had not only retained the city, but also launched raids on nearby Byzantine-held fortresses in the Rhodope Mountains, such as Stenimachos (modern Asenovgrad) and Tsepina. Plovdiv was lost, however, to the Byzantines soon thereafter. As Ivan's forces were leaving the city to meet the Bulgarian garrison that was to replace them, the pro-Byzantine inhabitants of Plovdiv opened the city gates and let a covert Byzantine detachment in.–ë–∞–∫–∞–ª–æ–≤, ‚Äú—é–Ω–∏, 1323 –≥.‚ÄùV√°s√°ry, p. 126. Anti-Byzantine plot and later career The loss of Plovdiv did not seem to have had a profound effect on Ivan's career, and he remained a royal favourite. In 1328, Ivan was tasked by Tsar Michael Shishman with the defence of the Great Palace of Constantinople, the residence of emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos. Andronikos II, facing imminent defeat at the hands of his grandson and co-emperor Andronikos III in a protracted civil war, was distrustful of his own guard, and had requested the assistance of Michael Shishman. The Bulgarian emperor sent Ivan the Russian along with 3,000 horsemen to Constantinople in aid. In the words of Byzantine historian Nikephoros Gregoras, the actual intentions of Michael Shishman were to use Ivan and his men as a Trojan Horse. In a suitable moment, the Bulgarian guard would arrest the emperor and take hold of the palace before allowing Michael Shishman with a large army and Tatar mercenaries into Constantinople.Jireƒçek, p. 419. In accordance with the plan, Ivan and his cavalry approached Constantinople while Michael Shishman waited in Yambol with his army. The plot was uncovered by the spies of Andronikos III. Fearing for his own imperial ambitions, he wrote to his rival and grandfather not to accept the Bulgarians into the capital. While Ivan stuck to the plan and signed an oath that he had come with peace to persuade the Byzantines, he promptly retreated to Bulgarian territory upon receiving that order from Michael Shishman.–ò—Ä–µ—á–µ–∫, pp. 340‚Äì341. Ivan's role in the final years of Tsar Michael Shishman's reign and the rule of Ivan Stephen is uncertain, as he is not mentioned in the sources pertaining to that period. His high-ranking position nevertheless leads Pavlov to conjecture that Ivan took part in the Battle of Velbazhd of 28 July 1330, a Serbian victory over Bulgaria that paved the way to the Serbian dominance of the Balkans in the mid-14th century. Michael Shishman was killed in the battle and succeeded by his son Ivan Stephen (1330‚Äì1331). Pavlov believes that Ivan the Russian was among the Bulgarian nobles that ousted the weak Ivan Stephen in 1331 and placed Ivan Alexander (1331‚Äì1371) on the throne. It is also probable that Ivan the Russian took part in the Bulgarian victory over Byzantium at Rusokastro in 1332 because he was last recorded as Ivan Alexander's representative in the peace negotiations that followed.–ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞ –µ–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è –ê‚Äì–Ø. Assessment Ivan the Russian was held in high regard by John VI Kantakouzenos, writer and later Byzantine emperor who likely personally faced Ivan in battle. In his History, Kantakouzenos calls Ivan a man ‚Äúskilled in strategy‚Äù. Kantakouzenos also referred to Ivan as ‚Äúone of Bulgaria's illustrious people‚Äù in his writings. Czech historian Konstantin Josef Jireƒçek, a prominent researcher of Bulgarian history, assesses Ivan as ‚Äúthe most clear-cut figure of a Bulgarian military leader‚Äù of that age. In the eyes of Pavlov, despite his foreign origin Ivan the Russian was not considered an emigrant or a mercenary by the Bulgarian nobility and the emperor, but rather a trusted commander and one of their own.
